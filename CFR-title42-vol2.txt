                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 1997), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.

[[Page vii]]

    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

    (a) General rule. The Freedom of Information Act rules shall be 
applied to every proposed disclosure of information. If, considering the 
circumstances of the disclosure, the information would be made available 
in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act rules, then the 
information may be disclosed regardless of whether the requester or 
recipient of the information has a statutory right to request the 
information under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, or 
whether a request has been made.
    (b) Application of the general rule. Pursuant to the general rule in 
paragraph (a) of this section,
    (1) Information shall be disclosed--
    (i) To a subject individual when required by the access provision of 
the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(d), as implemented by the Department 
Privacy Act regulation, 45 CFR part 5b; and
    (ii) To a person upon request when required by the Freedom of 
Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552;

disclosed to any requester or recipient of the information, including 
another Federal agency or a State or Federal court, when the information 
would not be exempt from mandatory disclosure under Freedom of 
Information Act rules or when the information nevertheless would be made 
available under the Department's public information regulation's 
criteria for disclosures which are in the public interest and consistent 
with obligations of confidentiality and administrative necessity, 45 CFR 
part 5, subpart F, as supplemented by Secs. 401.106 to 401.152 of this 
subpart.

been compiled and are available in the form of a record, the record 
shall be made available as provided in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 401.126  Information or records that are not available.

    (a) Specific exemptions from disclosure. Pursuant to paragraph (b) 
of 5 U.S.C. 552, certain classes of records are exempt from disclosure. 
For some examples of the kinds of materials which are

[[Page 12]]

exempt, see subpart F of the public information regulation of the 
Department of Health and Human Services (45 CFR part 5) and the appendix 
to that regulation.
    (b) Materials exempt from disclosure by statute. Pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(3) of 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, which exempts from the 
requirement for disclosure matters that are exempted from disclosure by 
statute, provided that such statute requires that the matters be 
withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on 
the issue, or establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers 
to particular types of matter to be withheld:
    (1) Reports described in sections 1106 (d) and (e) of the Social 
Security Act shall not be disclosed, except in accordance with the 
provisions of sections 1106 (d) and (e). Sections 1106 (d) and (e) 
provide for public inspection of certain official reports dealing with 
the operation of the health programs established by titles XVIII and XIX 
of the Social Security Act (Medicare and Medicaid), but require that 
program validation survey reports and other formal evaluations of 
providers of services shall not identify individual patients, individual 
health care practitioners, or other individuals. Section 1106(e) further 
requires that none of the reports shall be made public until the 
contractor or provider whose performance is being evaluated has had a 
reasonable opportunity to review that report and to offer comments. See 
Sec. 401.133 (b) and (c);
    (2)(i) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, 
HCFA may not disclose any accreditation survey or any information 
directly related to the survey (including corrective action plans) made 
by and released to it by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of 
Healthcare Organizations, the American Osteopathic Association or any 
other national accreditation organization that meets the requirements of 
Sec. 488.6 or Sec. 493.506 of this chapter. Materials that are 
confidential include accreditation letters and accompanying 
recommendations and comments prepared by an accreditation organization 
concerning the entities it surveys.
    (ii) Exceptions.
    (A) HCFA may release the accreditation survey of any home health 
agency; and
    (B) HCFA may release the accreditation survey and other information 
directly related to the survey (including corrective action plans) to 
the extent the survey and information relate to an enforcement action 
(for example, denial of payment for new admissions, civil money 
penalties, temporary management and termination) taken by HCFA; and
    (3) Tax returns and return information defined in section 6103 of 
the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1976, 
shall not be disclosed except as authorized by the Internal Revenue 
Code.
    (c) Effect of exemption. Neither 5 U.S.C. 552 nor this regulation 
directs the withholding of any record or information, except to the 
extent of the prohibitions in paragraph (b) of this section. Except for 
material required to be withheld under the statutory provisions 
incorporated in paragraph (b) of this section or under another statute 
which meets the standards in 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3), materials exempt from 
mandatory disclosure will nevertheless be made available when this can 
be done consistently with obligations of confidentiality and 
administrative necessity. The disclosure of materials or records under 
these circumstances in response to a specific request, however, is of no 
precedent force with respect to any other request.

the proper office.
    (b) Determinations of whether records will be released or withheld 
will be made within 10 working days from date of receipt of the request 
in the office listed in Sec. 401.128 except where HCFA extends this time 
and sends notice of such extension to the requester. Such extension may 
not exceed 10 additional working days and shall apply only where the 
following unusual circumstances exist:
    (1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from 
field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the 
office processing the requests;
    (2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a 
voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are requested 
in a single request; or
    (3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all 
practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in 
the request or among two or more components of HCFA having a substantial 
interest in the subject matter of the request.
    (c) If an extension is made, the requester will be notified in 
writing before the expiration of 10 working days from receipt of the 
request and will be given an explanation of why the extension was 
necessary and the date on which a determination will be made.
    (d) Authority to extend the time limit with respect to any request 
for information or records is granted to the Director, Office of Public 
Affairs, HCFA and to the Director of Public Affairs in any HHS Regional 
Office. Those officers and employees of HCFA who are listed in 
Sec. 401.144(a) as having authority to deny requests for information 
from records maintained on individuals are granted authority to extend 
the time limit for responding to requests for information from such 
records.


<R05>
Sec. 401.140  Fees and charges.

    (a) Statement of policy. It is HCFA's policy to comply with certain 
requests for information services without charge. Except as otherwise 
determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, fees will be 
charged for the following services with respect to all other requests 
for information from records which are reasonably identified by the 
requesters:
    (1) Reproduction, duplication, or copying of records;
    (2) Searches for records; and
    (3) Certification or authentication of records.
    (b) Fee schedules. The fee schedule is as follows:
    (1) Search for records. Three dollars per hour: Provided, however, 
That no charge will be made for the first half hour.
    (2) Reproduction, duplication, or copying of records. Ten cents per 
page where such reproduction can be made by commonly available 
photocopying machines. The cost of reproducing records which cannot be 
so photocopied will be determined on an individual basis at actual cost.
    (3) Certification or authentication of records. Three dollars per 
certification or authentication.
    (4) Forwarding materials to destination. Any special arrangements 
for forwarding which are requested shall be charged at actual cost; 
however, no charge will be made for postage.
    (5) No charge will be made when the total amount does not exceed 
five dollars.
    (c) Waiver or reduction of fees. Waiver or reduction of the fees in 
paragraph (b) of this section may be made upon a determination that such 
waiver or reduction is in the public interest because furnishing the 
information can be considered as primarily benefiting the general 
public. Such determination may be made by the appropriate officer or 
employee identified in Sec. 401.144.
    (d) Sale of documents. On occasion, a previously printed document 
may be available for sale to the public; the cost of supplying the 
document is one cent per page unless the document is available for sale 
from the Superintendent of Documents, in which case the price shall be 
that determined by the Superintendent.

<R05>
Sec. 401.144  Denial of requests.

    (a) General authority. Only the Director, Office of Public Affairs, 
HCFA, and the Regional Directors of Public Affairs, HHS, are authorized 
to deny written requests to obtain, inspect or copy any HCFA information 
or record.
    (b) Forms of denials. (1) Oral requests may be dealt with orally, 
but the requester should be advised that the oral response is not an 
official determination and that an official determination may be 
obtained only by submitting the request in writing. Appropriate 
available assistance will be offered.
    (2) Written Requests--Denials of written requests will be in writing 
and will contain the reasons for the denial including, as appropriate, a 
statement that a document requested is nonexistent or not reasonably 
described or is subject to one or more clearly described exemption(s). 
Denials will also provide the requester with appropriate information on 
how to exercise the right of appeal.


<R05>
Sec. 401.148  Administrative review.

    (a) Review by the Administrator. A person whose request has been 
denied may initiate a review by filing a request for review with the 
Administrator of HCFA, 700 East High Rise Building, 6401 Security 
Boulevard, Baltimore, Maryland 21235, within 30 days of receipt of the 
determination to deny or within 30 days of receipt of records which are 
in partial response to his request if a portion of a request is granted 
and a portion denied, whichever is later. Upon receipt of a timely 
request for review, the Administrator will review the decision in 
question and the findings upon which it was based. Upon the basis of the 
data considered in connection with the decision and whatever other 
evidence and written argument is submitted by the person requesting the 
review or which is otherwise obtained, the Administrator or his designee 
will affirm or revise in whole or in part the findings and decision in 
question. A decision to affirm the denial will be made only upon 
concurrence of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, or his 
designee, after consultation with the General Counsel or his or her 
designee, and the appropriate program policy official. Written notice of 
the decision of the Administrator will be mailed to the person who 
requested the review. A written decision will be made within 20 working 
days from receipt of the request for review. Extension of the time limit 
may be granted under the circumstances listed in Sec. 401.136(b) to the 
extent that the maximum 10 days limit on extensions has not been 
exhausted on the initial determination. The decision will include the 
basis for it and will advise the requester of his right to judicial 
review.
    (b) Failure of the Administrator to comply with the time limits. 
Failure of the Administrator to comply with the time limits set forth in 
Sec. 401.136 and this section constitutes an exhaustion of the 
requester's administrative remedies.


<R05>
Sec. 401.152  Court review.

    Where the Administrator upon review affirms the denial of a request 
for records, in whole or in part, the requester may seek court review in 
the district court of the United States pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552(a)(4)(B).

<R04>
               Subpart F--Claims Collection and Compromise

    Source:  48 FR 39064, Aug. 29, 1983, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 401.601  Basis and scope.

    (a) Basis. This subpart implements for HCFA the Federal Claims 
Collection Act (FCCA) of 1966 (31 U.S.C. 3711), and conforms to the 
regulations (4 CFR parts 101-105) issued jointly by the General 
Accounting Office and the Department of Justice that generally prescribe 
claims collection standards and procedures under the FCCA for the 
Federal government.
    (b) Scope. Except as provided in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this 
section, the regulations in this subpart describe HCFA's procedures and 
standards for the collection of claims in any amount, and the compromise 
of, or the suspension or termination of collection action on, all claims 
for money or property that do not exceed $100,000 or such higher amount 
as the Attorney General

[[Page 19]]

may from time to time prescribe, exclusive of interest, arising under 
any functions delegated to HCFA by the Secretary.
    (c) Amount of claim. HCFA refers all claims that exceed $100,000 or 
such higher amount as the Attorney General may from time to time 
prescribe, exclusive of interest, to the Department of Justice or the 
General Accounting Office for the compromise of claims, or the 
suspension or termination of collection action.
    (d) Related regulations--(1) Department regulations. DHHS 
regulations applicable to HCFA that generally implement the FCCA for the 
Department are located at 45 CFR part 30. These regulations apply only 
to the extent HCFA regulations do not address a situation.
    (2) HCFA regulations. The following regulations govern specific debt 
management situations encountered by HCFA and supplement this subpart:
    (i) Claims against Medicare beneficiaries for the recovery of 
overpayments are covered in 20 CFR 404.515.
    (ii) Adjustments in Railroad Retirement or Social Security benefits 
to recover Medicare overpayments to individuals are covered in 
Secs. 405.350--405.358 of this chapter.
    (iii) Claims against providers, physicians, or other suppliers of 
services for overpayments under Medicare and for assessment of interest 
are covered in Secs. 405.377 and 405.378 of this chapter, respectively.
    (iv) Claims against beneficiaries for unpaid hospital insurance or 
supplementary medical insurance premiums under Medicare are covered in 
Sec. 408.110 of this chapter.
    (v) State repayment of Medicaid funds by installments is covered in 
Sec. 430.48 of this chapter.
    (e) Collection and compromise under other statutes and at common 
law. The regulations in this subpart do not--
    (1) Preclude disposition by HCFA of claims under statutes, other 
than the FCCA, that provide for the collection or compromise of a claim, 
or suspension or termination of collection action.
    (2) Affect any rights that HCFA may have under common law as a 
creditor.
    (f) Fraud. The regulations in this subpart do not apply to claims in 
which there is an indication of fraud, the presentation of a false 
claim, or misrepresentation on the part of a debtor or any other party 
having an interest in the claim. HCFA forwards these claims to the 
Department of Justice for disposition under 4 CFR 105.1.
    (g) Enforced collection. HCFA refers claims to the Department of 
Justice for enforced collection through litigation in those cases which 
cannot be compromised or on which collection action cannot be suspended 
or terminated in accordance with this subpart or the regulations issued 
jointly by the Attorney General and the Comptroller General.

Dec. 2, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 401.603  Definitions.

    For purposes of this subpart--
    Claim means any debt owed to HCFA.
    Debtor means any individual, partnership, corporation, estate, trust 
or other legal entity against which HCFA has a claim.


<R05>
Sec. 401.605  Omissions not a defense.

    The failure of HCFA to comply with the regulations in this subpart, 
or with the related regulations listed in Sec. 401.601(d), is not 
available as a defense to a debtor against whom HCFA has a claim for 
money or property.


<R05>
Sec. 401.607  Claims collection.

    (a) General policy. HCFA recovers amounts of claims due from 
debtors, including interest where appropriate, by--
    (1) Direct collections in lump sums or in installments; or
    (2) Offsets against monies owed to the debtor by the Federal 
government where possible.
    (b) Collection in lump sums. Whenever possible, HCFA attempts to 
collect claims in full in one lump sum. However, if HCFA determines that 
a debtor is unable to pay the claim in one lump sum, HCFA may instead 
enter into an agreement to accept regular installment payments.
    (c) Collection in installments. Generally, HCFA requires that all 
claims

[[Page 20]]

to be satisfied by installment payments must be liquidated in three 
years or less. If unusual circumstances exist, such as the possibility 
of debtor insolvency, an installment agreement that extends beyond three 
years may be approved.
    (1) Debtor request. If a debtor desires to repay a claim in 
installments, the debtor must submit--
    (i) A request to HCFA; and
    (ii) Any information required by HCFA to make a decision regarding 
the request.
    (2) HCFA decision. HCFA will determine the number, amount and 
frequency of installment payments based on the information submitted by 
the debtor and on other factors such as--
    (i) Total amount of the claim;
    (ii) Debtor's ability to pay; and
    (iii) Cost to HCFA of administering an installment agreement.
    (d) Collection by offset. (1) HCFA may offset, where possible, the 
amount of a claim against the amount of pay, compensation, benefits or 
other monies that a debtor is receiving or is due from the Federal 
government.
    (2) Under regulations at Sec. 405.350--405.358 of this chapter, HCFA 
may initiate adjustments in program payments to which an individual is 
entitled under title II of the Act (Federal Old Age, Survivors, and 
Disability Insurance Benefits) or under the Railroad Retirement Act of 
1974 (45 U.S.C. 231) to recover Medicare overpayments.

[48 FR 39064, Aug. 29, 1983, as amended at 61 FR 49271, Sept. 19, 1996; 
61 FR 63748, Dec. 2, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 401.613  Compromise of claims.

    (a) Amount of compromise. HFCA requires that the amount to be 
recovered through a compromise of a claim must--
    (1) Bear a reasonable relation to the amount of the claim; and
    (2) Be recoverable through enforced collection procedures.
    (b) General factors. After considering the bases for a decision to 
compromise a claim under paragraph (c) of this section, HCFA may further 
consider factors such as--
    (1) The age and health of the debtor if the debtor is an individual;
    (2) Present and potential income of the debtor; and
    (3) Whether assets have been concealed or improperly transferred by 
the debtor.
    (c) Basis for compromise. Bases on which HCFA may compromise a claim 
include the following--
    (1) Inability to pay. HCFA may compromise a claim if it determines 
that the debtor, or the estate of a deceased debtor, does not have the 
present or prospective ability to pay the full amount of the claim 
within a reasonable time.
    (2) Litigative probabilities. HCFA may compromise a claim if it 
determines that it would be difficult to prevail in a case before a 
court of law as a result of the legal issues involved or inability of 
the parties to agree to the facts of the case. The amount that HCFA 
accepts in compromise under this provision will reflect--
    (i) The likelihood that HCFA would have prevailed on the legal 
question(s) involved;
    (ii) Whether and to what extent HCFA would have obtained a full or 
partial recovery of a judgment, depending on the availability of 
witnesses, or other evidentiary support for HCFA's claim; and
    (iii) The amount of court costs that would be assessed to HCFA.
    (3) Cost of collecting the claim. HCFA may compromise a claim if it 
determines that the cost of collecting the claim does not justify the 
enforced collection of the full amount. In this case, HCFA may adjust 
the amount it accepts as a compromise to allow an appropriate discount 
for the costs of collection it would have incurred but for the 
compromise.
    (d) Enforcement policy. HCFA may compromise statutory penalties, 
forfeitures, or debts established as an aid to enforcement or to compel 
compliance, if it determines that its enforcement policy, in terms of 
deterrence and securing compliance both present and future, is 
adequately served by acceptance of the compromise amount.


<R05>
Sec. 401.615  Payment of compromise amount.

    (a) Time and manner of compromise. Payment by the debtor of the 
amount

[[Page 21]]

that HCFA has agreed to accept as a compromise in full settlement of a 
claim must be made within the time and in the manner prescribed by HCFA. 
Accordingly, HCFA will not settle a claim until the full payment of the 
compromise amount has been made.
    (b) Effect of failure to pay compromise amount. Failure of the 
debtor to make payment, as provided by the compromise agreement, 
reinstates the full amount of the claim, less any amounts paid prior to 
the default.
    (c) Prohibition against grace periods. HCFA will not agree to 
inclusion of a provision in an installment agreement that would permit 
grace periods for payments that are late under the terms of the 
agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 401.617  Suspension of collection action.

    (a) General conditions. HCFA may temporarily suspend collection 
action on a claim if the following general conditions are met--
    (1) Amount of future recovery. HCFA determines that future 
collection action may result in a recovery of an amount sufficient to 
justify periodic review and action on the claim by HCFA during the 
period of suspension.
    (2) Statute of limitations. HCFA determines that--
    (i) The applicable statute of limitations has been tolled, waived or 
has started running anew; or
    (ii) Future collections may be made by HCFA through offset despite 
an applicable statute of limitations.
    (b) Basis for suspension. Bases on which HCFA may suspend collection 
action on a particular claim include the following--
    (1) A debtor cannot be located; or
    (2) A debtor--
    (i) Owns no substantial equity in property;
    (ii) Is unable to make payment on HCFA's claim or is unable to 
effect a compromise; and
    (iii) Has future prospects that justify retention of the claim.
    (c) Locating debtors. HCFA will make every reasonable effort to 
locate missing debtors sufficiently in advance of the bar of an 
applicable statute of limitations to permit timely filing of a lawsuit 
to recover the amount of the claim.
    (d) Effect of suspension on liquidation of security. HCFA will 
liquidate security, obtained in partial recovery of a claim, despite a 
decision under this section to suspend collection action against the 
debtor for the remainder of the claim.


<R05>
Sec. 401.621  Termination of collection action.

    (a) General factors. After considering the bases for a decision to 
terminate collection action under paragraph (b) of this section, HCFA 
may further consider factors such as--
    (1) The age and health of the debtor if the debtor is an individual;
    (2) Present and potential income of the debtor; and
    (3) Whether assets have been concealed or improperly transferred by 
the debtor.
    (b) Basis for termination of collection action. Bases on which HCFA 
may terminate collection action on a claim include the following--
    (1) Inability to collect a substantial amount of the claim. HCFA may 
terminate collection action if it determines that it is unable to 
collect, or to enforce collection, of a significant amount of the claim. 
In making this determination, HCFA will consider factors such as--
    (i) Judicial remedies available;
    (ii) The debtor's future financial prospects; and
    (iii) Exemptions available to the debtor under State or Federal law.
    (2) Inability to locate debtor. In cases involving missing debtors, 
HCFA may terminate collection action if--
    (i) There is no security remaining to be liquidated;
    (ii) The applicable statute of limitations has run; or
    (iii) The prospects of collecting by offset, whether or not an 
applicable statute of limitations has run, are considered by HCFA to be 
too remote to justify retention of the claim.
    (3) Cost of collection exceeds recovery. HCFA may terminate 
collection action if it determines that the cost of further collection 
action will exceed the amount recoverable.

[[Page 22]]

    (4) Legal insufficiency. HCFA may terminate collection action if it 
determines that the claim is legally without merit.
    (5) Evidence unavailable. HCFA may terminate collection action if--
    (i) Efforts to obtain voluntary payment are unsuccessful; and
    (ii) Evidence or witnesses necessary to prove the claim are 
unavailable.


<R05>
Sec. 401.623  Joint and several liability.

    (a) Collection action. HCFA will liquidate claims as quickly as 
possible. In cases of joint and several liability among two or more 
debtors, HCFA will not allocate the burden of claims payment among the 
debtors. HCFA will proceed with collection action against one debtor 
even if other liable debtors have not paid their proportionate shares.
    (b) Compromise. Compromise with one debtor does not release a claim 
against remaining debtors. Furthermore, HCFA will not consider the 
amount of a compromise with one debtor to be a binding precedent 
concerning the amounts due from other debtors who are jointly and 
severally liable on the claim.


<R05>
Sec. 401.625  Effect of HCFA claims collection decisions on appeals.

    Any action taken under this subpart regarding the compromise of a 
claim, or suspension or termination of collection action on a claim, is 
not an initial determination for purposes of HCFA appeal procedures.

<R04>
                Subpart B--Medicare Supplemental Policies

    Source:  47 FR 32400, July 26, 1982, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 403.200  Basis and scope.

    (a) Provisions of the legislation. This subpart implements, in part, 
section 1882 of the Social Security Act. The intent of that section is 
to enable Medicare beneficiaries to identify Medicare supplemental 
policies that do not duplicate Medicare, and that provide adequate, 
fairly priced protection against expenses not covered by Medicare. The 
legislation establishes certain standards for Medicare supplemental 
policies and provides two methods for informing Medicare beneficiaries 
which policies meet those standards:
    (1) Through a State approved program, that is, a program that a 
Supplemental Health Insurance Panel determines to meet certain minimum 
requirements for the regulation of Medicare supplemental policies; and
    (2) In a State without an approved program, through certification by 
the Secretary of policies voluntarily submitted by insuring 
organizations for review against the standards.
    (b) Scope of subpart. This subpart sets forth the standards and 
procedures HCFA will use to implement the voluntary certification 
program.

                           General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 403.201  State regulation of insurance policies.

    (a) The provisions of this subpart do not affect the right of a 
State to regulate policies marketed in that State.
    (b) Approval of a policy under the voluntary certification program, 
as provided for in Sec. 403.235(b), does not authorize the insuring 
organization to market a policy that does not conform to applicable 
State laws and regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 403.205  Medicare supplemental policy.

    (a) Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, Medicare 
supplemental policy (policy) means a health insurance policy or other 
health benefit plan--
    (1) That a private entity offers to a Medicare beneficiary; and
    (2) That is primarily designed, or is advertised, marketed, or 
otherwise purported to provide payment for expenses incurred for 
services and items that are not reimbursed under the Medicare program 
because of deductibles, coinsurance, or other limitations under 
Medicare.
    (b) Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, the term policy 
includes both policy form and policy.
    (1) Policy form means the form of health insurance contract that is 
approved by and on file with the State agency for the regulation of 
insurance.
    (2) Policy means the contract--
    (i) Issued under the policy form; and
    (ii) Held by the policyholder.
    (c) Medicare supplemental policy includes the following--
    (1) An individual policy.
    (2) A group policy.
    (d) Medicare supplemental policy does not include any of the 
following health insurance policies or health benefit plans--
    (1) A policy or plan of one or more employers for employees, former 
employees, or any combination thereof.
    (2) A policy or plan of one or more labor organizations for members, 
former members, or any combination thereof.
    (3) A policy or plan of the trustees of a fund established by one or 
more labor organizations, one or more employers, or any combination, for 
any one or combination of the following--
    (i) Employees.
    (ii) Former employees.
    (iii) Members.
    (iv) Former members.
    (4) A policy or plan of a profession, trade, or occupational 
association, if the association--
    (i) Is composed of individuals all of whom are actively engaged in 
the same profession, trade, or occupation;

[[Page 24]]

    (ii) Has been maintained in good faith for a purpose other than 
obtaining insurance; and
    (iii) Has been in existence for at least two years before the date 
of its initial offering of a Medicare supplemental health insurance

subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 403.304  Minimum requirements for State systems--discretionary approval.

    (a) Discretionary approval by HCFA. HCFA may approve Medicare 
payments under a State system, if HCFA determines that the system meets 
the requirements in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and, if 
applicable paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) Requirements for State system. (1) An application for approval 
of the system must be submitted to HCFA by the Chief Executive Officer 
of the State.
    (2) The State system must apply to substantially all non-Federal 
acute care hospitals in the State.
    (3) All hospitals covered by the system must have and maintain a 
utilization and quality control review agreement with a Peer Review 
Organization, as required under section 1866(a)(1)(F) of the Act and 
Sec. 466.78(a) of this chapter.
    (4) Federal hospitals must be excluded from the State system.
    (5) Nonacute care or specialty hospital (such as rehabilitation,

be excluded from the State system.
    (6) The State system must apply to at least 75 percent of all 
revenues or expenses--
    (i) For inpatient hospital services in the State; and
    (ii) For inpatient hospital services under the State's Medicaid 
plan.
    (7) Under the system, HMOs and competitive medical plans (CMPs), as 
defined by section 1876(b) of the Act and part 417 of this chapter, must 
be allowed to negotiate payment rates with hospitals.
    (8) The system must limit hospital charges for Medicare 
beneficiaries to deductibles, coinsurance or non-covered services.
    (9) Unless a waiver is granted by HCFA under Sec. 489.23 of this 
chapter, the system must prohibit payment, as required under section 
1862(a)(14) of the Act and Sec. 405.310(m) of this chapter, for 
nonphysician services provided to hospital inpatients under Part B of 
Medicare.
    (10) The system must require hospitals to submit Medicare cost 
reports or approved reports in lieu of Medicare cost reports as 
required.
    (11) The system must require--
    (i) Preparation, collection, or retention by the State of reports 
(such as financial, administrative, or statistical reports) that may be 
necessary, as determined by HCFA, to review and monitor the State's 
assurances; and
    (ii) Submission of the reports to HCFA upon request.
    (12) The system must provide hospitals an opportunity to appeal 
errors that they believe have been made in the determination of their

available must be equitably and uniformly applied to all payors, except 
for discounts negotiated by HMOs and CMPs. Discounts available to HMOs 
and CMPs as result of their statutory right to negotiate payment rates 
independently of a State system, as described in paragraph (b)(7) of

otherwise have been made under the Medicare principles of reimbursement 
for Medicare items and services had the State system not been in effect. 
States must submit the assurance and supporting data as required by 
Sec. 403.320 to document that the payment limit is not exceeded. States 
that have an existing Medicare demonstration project in effect on April 
20, 1983, and that have requested approval of a State system under 
section 1886(c)(4) of the Act, may elect to have the effectiveness of 
the State system under this paragraph judged on the basis of the State 
system's rate of increase or inflation in Medicare inpatient hospital 
payments as compared to the national rate of increase or inflation for 
such payments during the three cost reporting periods of the hospitals 
in the State beginning on or after October 1, 1983.
    (d) Additional cost-effectiveness assurance. If the assurances and 
supporting data required under paragraph (c)(3) of this section are 
insufficient to provide assurance satisfactory to HCFA regarding the 
cost-effectiveness of a State system, the State may additionally submit 
one of the following assurances in order to meet the cost-effectiveness 
test:
    (1) State responsibility for excess payments. The State must agree 
that each month Medicare intermediaries will disburse to the State's 
hospital Federal funds that in the aggregate equal no more than would 
have been disbursed in the absence of the State system. Any additional 
funds necessary to pay hospitals for Medicare services required by the 
State system will be paid to the intermediaries by the State. These 
additional amounts will be refunded to the State by the intermediaries 
to the extent that, in subsequent months, the State system requires a 
smaller aggregate payment for Medicare services than would have been 
paid in the absence of the State system.
    (2) Limitations on payments. (i) The State must agree that if its 
projections exceed what Medicare would pay in any particular period, the 
State and HCFA will establish and agreed upon payment schedule that will 
limit payments under the State system based on a predetermined 
percentage relationship between projected State payments and what 
payments would have been under Medicare.
    (ii) If deviation from the predetermined relationship described in 
paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section occurs, the State must further agree 
that--
    (A) Medicare payments would be capped automatically at payment 
levels based on the rates used for the Medicare prospective payment 
system and the State would be required to pay the difference to 
individual hospitals in its system; or
    (B) The State may provide by legislation or legally binding 
regulations that any reduced payments to hospitals under the system that 
result from this cost-effectiveness assurance will constitute full and 
final payment for hospital services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries 
for the period covered by these reduced payments.


<R05>
Sec. 403.306  Additional requirements for State systems--mandatory approval.

    (a) General policy--(1) Mandatory approval. HFCA will approve an 
application for Medicare reimbursement under a State system if the 
system meets all of the requirements of Sec. 403.304 and of paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (2) Exception. HCFA may approve an application if the State system 
meets all of the requirements of Sec. 403.304 but

[[Page 32]]

only some of the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Additional requirements--(1) Operation of system. The system 
must--
    (i) Be operated directly by the State or by entity designated under 
State law;
    (ii) Provide for payments to hospitals using a methodology under 
which--
    (A) Prospectively determined payment rates are established; and
    (B) Exceptions, adjustments, and methods for changes in methodology 
are set forth;
    (iii) Provide that a change by the State in the system that has the 
effect of materially changing payments to hospitals can take effect only 
upon 60 days notice to HCFA and to the hospitals likely to be materially 
affected by the change and upon HCFA's approval of the change.
    (2) Satisfactory assurances--(i) Admissions practice. The State must 
assure that the operation of the system will not result in any change in 
hospital admission practices that result in--
    (A) A significant reduction in the proportion of patients receiving 
hospital services covered under the system who have no third-party 
coverage and who are unable to pay for hospital services;
    (B) A significant reduction in the proportion of individuals 
admitted to hospitals for inpatient hospital services for which payment 
is less, or is likely to be less, than the anticipated charges for or 
cost of the services;
    (C) A refusal to admit patients who would be expected to require 
unusually costly or prolonged treatment for reasons other than those 
related to the appropriateness of the care available at the hospital; or
    (D) A refusal to provide emergency services to any person who is in 
need of emergency services, if the hospital provides the services.
    (ii) Consultation with local government officials. The State must 
provide documentation that it has consulted with local government 
officials concerning the impact of the system on publicly owned or 
operated hospitals.


<R05>
Sec. 403.308  State systems under demonstration projects--mandatory approval.

    HCFA will approve an application from a State for a State system 
if--
    (a) The system was in effect prior to April 20, 1983 under an 
existing demonstration project; and
    (b) The minimum requirements and assurances for approval of a State 
system are met under Sec. 403.304 (b)(1)-(10) and Sec. 403.304(c), and, 
if appropriate Sec. 403.304(d).


<R05>
Sec. 403.310  Reduction in payments.

    (a) General rule. If HCFA determines that the satisfactory 
assurances required of a State under Sec. 403.304(c) and, if applicable, 
Sec. 403.304(d) have not been met, or will not be met, with respect to 
any 36-month period, HCFA will reduce Medicare payments to individual 
hospitals being reimbursed under the State's system or, if applicable, 
under the Medicare payment system, in an amount equal to the amount by 
which the Medicare payments under the system exceed the amount of 
Medicare payments to such hospitals that otherwise would have been made 
not using the State system. The amount of the recoupment will include, 
when appropriate, interest charges computed in accordance with 
Sec. 405.378 of this chapter.
    (b) Recoupment procedures. The amount of the overpayment will be 
recouped on a proportionate basis from each of those hospitals that 
received payments under the State system that exceeded the payments they 
would have received under the Medicare payment system. Each hospital's 
share of the aggregate excess payment will be determined on the basis of 
a comparison of the hospital's proportionate share of the aggregate 
payment received under the State system that is in excess of what the 
aggregate payment would have been under the Medicare payment system. 
Recoupments may be accomplished by a hospital's direct payment to the 
Medicare program or by offsets to future payments made to the hospital.
    (c) Alternative recoupment procedures. As an alternative to the 
recoupment procedures described in paragraph (b) of this section and 
subject to HCFA's

[[Page 33]]

acceptance, the State may provide, by legislation or legally binding 
regulations, procedures for the recoupment of the amount of payments 
that exceed the amount of payments that otherwise would have been paid 
by Medicare if the State system had not been in effect.
    (d) Rule for existing Medicare demonstration projects. In cases of 
existing Medicare demonstration projects where the expenditure test is 
to be applied by a rate of increase factor, the amount of the excess 
payment will be determined, for the three hospital cost reporting 
periods beginning before October 1, 1986, by a comparison of the State 
system's rate of increase to the national rate of increase. Recoupment 
of excessive payments will be assessed and recouped as described in this 
section.

<R05>
Sec. 403.312  Submittal of application.

    The Chief Executive Officer of the State is responsible for--
    (a) Submittal of the application to HCFA for approval; and
    (b) Supplying the assurances and necessary documentation as required 
under Secs. 403.304 through 403.308.


<R05>
Sec. 403.314  Evaluation of State systems.

    HCFA will evaluate all State applications for approval of State 
systems and notify the State of its determination within 60 days.


<R05>
Sec. 403.316  Reconsideration of certain denied applications.

    (a) Request for reconsideration. If HCFA denies an application for a 
State system, the State may request that HCFA reconsider the denial if 
the State believes that its system meets all of the requirements for 
mandatory approval under Secs. 403.304 and 403.306 or, in the case of a 
State with a system operating under an existing demonstration project, 
the applicable requirements of Secs. 403.304 and 403.308.
    (b) Time limit. (1) The State must submit its request for 
reconsideration within 60 days after the date of HCFA's notice that the 
application was denied.
    (2) HCFA will notify the State of the results of its reconsideration 
within 60 days after it receives the request for reconsideration.


<R05>
Sec. 403.318  Approval of State systems.

    (a) Approval agreement. If HCFA approves a State system, a written 
agreement will be executed between HCFA and the Chief Executive Officer 
of the State. The agreement must incorporate any terms of the State's 
application for approval of the system as agreed to by the parties and, 
as a minimum, must contain provisions that require the following:
    (1) The system is operated directly by the State or an entity 
designated by State law.
    (2) For purposes of the Medicare program, the State's system applies 
only to Medicare payments for inpatient, and if applicable, outpatient 
hospital services.
    (3) The system conforms to applicable Medicare law and regulations 
other than those relating to the amount of reimbursement for inpatient 
hospital services, or for inpatient and outpatient services, whichever 
the State system covers. Applicable regulations include, for example, 
those describing Medicare benefits and entitlement requirements for 
program beneficiaries, as explained in parts 406 and 409 of this 
chapter; the requirements at part 405, subpart J of this chapter 
specifying conditions of participation for hospitals; the requirements 
at part 405, subparts A, G, and S of this chapter on Medicare program 
administration; and all applicable fraud and abuse regulations contained 
in titles 42 and 45 of the CFR.
    (4) The State must obtain HCFA's approval of the State's reporting 
forms and of provider cost reporting forms or other forms that have not 
been approved by HCFA but that are necessary for the collection of 
required information.
    (b) Effective date. An approved State system may not be effective 
earlier than the date of the approval agreement, which may not be 
retroactive.


<R05>
Sec. 403.320  HCFA review and monitoring of State systems.

    (a) General rule. The State must submit an assurance and detailed 
and quantitative studies of provider cost

[[Page 34]]

and financial data and projections to support the effectiveness of its 
system, as required by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) Required information. (1) Under Sec. 403.304(c)(3) an assurance 
is required that the system will not result in greater payments over a 
36-month period than would have otherwise been made under Medicare not 
using such system. If a State that has an existing demonstration project 
in effect on April 20, 1983 elects under Sec. 403.304(c)(3) to have the 
effectiveness of its system judged on the basis of a rate of increase 
factor, the State must submit an assurance that its rate of increase or 
inflation in inpatient hospital payments does not exceed, for that 
portion of the 36-month period that is subject to this test, the 
national rate of increase or inflation in Medicare inpatient hospital 
payments. The election of the rate of increase test applies only to the 
three cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1983. At 
the end of these cost reporting periods, the State must assure, 
beginning with the first month after the expiration of the third cost 
reporting period beginning after October 1, 1983, that payments under 
its system will not exceed over the remainder of the 36-month period 
what Medicare payments would have been.
    (2) Estimates and data are required to support the State's 
assurance, required under Sec. 403.304(c)(3), that expenditures under 
the State system will not exceed what Medicare would have paid over a 
36-month period. The estimates and projections of what Medicare would 
have otherwise paid must take into account all the Medicare 
reimbursement principles in effect at the time and, for any period in 
which payments either exceed or are less than Medicare levels, the 
values of interest the Medicare Trust Fund earned, or would have earned, 
on these amounts. Upon application for approval, the State must submit 
projections for each hospital for the first 12-month period covered by 
the assurance, in both the aggregate and on a per discharge basis, of 
Medicare inpatient expenditures under Medicare principles of 
reimbursement and parallel projections of Medicare inpatient 
expenditures under the State's system and the resulting cost or savings 
to Medicare. The State must also submit separate statewide projections 
for each year of the 36-month period, in both the aggregate and on a 
weighted average discharge basis, of inpatient expenditures under the 
State system and under the Medicare principles of reimbursement.
    (3) The projection submitted under paragraph (b)(2) of this section 
must include a detailed description of the methodology and assumptions 
used to derive the expenditure amounts under both systems. In instances 
where the assumptions are different under the projections cited in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the State must provide a detailed 
explanation of the reasons for the differences. At a minimum, the 
following separate data and assumptions are to be included in the 
projections for the Medicare principles and for the State's system.
    (i) The State system base year and the Medicare allowable and 
reimbursable cost of each hospital that the State used to develop the 
projections, including the amount of estimated pass through costs.
    (ii) The categories of costs that are included in the State system 
and are reimbursed differently under the State system than under the 
Medicare system.
    (iii) The number of Medicare and total base year discharges and 
admissions for each hospital.
    (iv) The rate of change factor (and the method of application of 
this factor) used to project the base year costs over the 36-month 
period to which the assurance would apply.
    (v) Any allowance for anticipated growth in the amount of services 
from the base year (if applicable, the allowance must be presented in 
separate estimates for population increases or for increases in rates of 
admissions or both).
    (vi) Any adjustment in which the State is permitted by HCFA to take 
into account previous reductions in the Medicare payment amounts that 
were the result of the effectiveness of the State's system even though 
Medicare was not a part of that system.
    (vii) Appropriate recognition and projection of the time value of 
trust fund

[[Page 35]]

expenditures for the period the State system expenditures were either 
less than or exceeded the Medicare system payments.
    (viii) States applying under a rate of increase effectiveness test 
under Sec. 403.304(c)(3) must also submit data projecting the parallel 
rates of increase during the requisite period.
    (4) The projections must include both the aggregate payments and the 
payments per discharge for the individual hospitals and for the State as 
a whole.
    (5) On a case-by-case basis. HCFA may require additional data and 
documentation as needed to complete its review and monitoring.
    (6) For existing Medicare demonstration projects in effect on April 
20, 1983, the assurance and data as required by paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of this section, if appropriate, may be based on aggregate payments or 
payments per inpatient admission or discharge. HCFA will judge the 
effectiveness of these systems on the basis of the rate of increase or 
inflation in Medicare inpatient hospital payments compared to the 
national rate of increase or inflation for such payments during the 
State's hospitals' three cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 1983. The data submitted by the State for the period subject 
to the rate of increase test must include the rate of increase 
projection for that particular period of time. For the subsequent period 
of time, the State must assure that payments under its system will not 
exceed what Medicare payments would have been, as described in 
Sec. 403.304(c)(3).
    (7) If the amount of Medicare payments under the State system 
exceeds what would have been paid under the Medicare reimbursement 
principles in any given year, the State must also submit quantitative 
evidence that the system will result in expenditures that do not exceed 
what Medicare expenditures would have been over the 36 month period 
beginning with the first month that the State system is operating. For a 
State that has an existing demonstration project in effect on April 20, 
1983, and that elects under Sec. 403.304(c)(3) to have a rate of 
increase test apply, if the State's rate of increase or inflation 
exceeds the national rate of increase or inflation in a given year, the 
State must submit quantitative evidence that, over 36 months, its 
payments will not exceed the national rate of increase or inflation. 
Furthermore, if payments under the State's system must be compared to 
actual Medicare expenditures, at the end of the third cost reporting 
period, as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and payments 
under the State's system exceed what Medicare would have paid in a given 
year, the State must submit quantitative evidence that, over 36 months, 
payments under its system will not exceed what Medicare would have paid.
    (c) Review of assurances regarding expenditures. HCFA will review 
the State's assurances and data submitted under this section, as a 
prerequisite to the approval of the State's system. HCFA will compare 
the State's projections of payment amounts to HCFA data in order to 
determine if the State's assurance is reasonable and fully supportable. 
If the HCFA data indicate that the State's system would result in 
payment amounts that would be more then that which would have been paid 
under the Medicare principles, the State's assurances would not be 
acceptable. For States applying in accordance with Sec. 403.308, if HCFA 
data indicate that the State's system would result in a rate of increase 
or inflation that would be more than the national rate of increase or 
inflation, the State's assurances would not be acceptable.
    (d) Medicaid upper limit. In accordance with Sec. 447.253 of this 
chapter, the State system may not result in aggregate payments for 
Medicaid inpatient hospital services that would exceed the amount that 
would have otherwise have been paid under the Medicare principles as 
applied through the State system.
    (e) Monitoring of Medicare expenditures. HCFA will monitor on a 
quarterly basis expenditures under the State's system as compared to 
what Medicare expenditures would have been if the system had not been in 
effect. If HCFA determines at any time that the payments made under the 
State's system exceed the States' projections, as

[[Page 36]]

established by the satisfactory assurances required under 
Sec. 403.304(c) and, if appropriate, the predetermined percentage 
relationship of the payments as required under Sec. 403.304(d). HCFA 
will--
    (1) Conclude that payments under the State system over a 36-month 
period will exceed what Medicare would have paid:
    (2) Terminate the waiver; and
    (3) Recoup overpayments to the affected hospitals in accordance with 
the procedures described in Sec. 403.310.


<R05>
Sec. 403.321  State systems for hospital outpatient services.

    HCFA may approve a State's application for approval of an outpatient 
system if the following conditions are met:
    (a) The State's inpatient system is approved.
    (b) The State's outpatient application meets the requirements and 
assurances for an inpatient system described in Sec. 403.304 (b) and 
(c), and Sec. 403.306 (b)(1) and (b)(2)(ii).
    (c) The State submits a separate application that provides separate 
assurances and estimates and data in further support of its assurance 
submitted under paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 403.320, as follows:
    (1) Upon application for approval, the State must submit estimates 
and data that include, but are not limited to, projections for the first 
12-month period covered by the assurance for each hospital, in both the 
aggregate and on an average cost per service and payment basis, of 
Medicare outpatient expenditures under Medicare principles of 
reimbursement; parallel projections of Medicare outpatient expenditures 
under the State system; and the resulting cost or savings to Medicare 
independent of the State system for hospital inpatient services.
    (2) The State must submit separate statewide projections for each 
year of the 36-month period of the aggregate outpatient expenditures for 
each system. The projections submitted under this paragraph must--
    (i) Comply with the requirements of paragraphs (b) (3) and (5) of 
Sec. 403.320 regarding a detailed description of the methodology used to 
derive the expenditure amounts:
    (ii) Include the data and assumptions set forth in paragraphs (b)(3) 
(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), and (v) of Sec. 403.320; and
    (iii) Include any assumption the State has adopted for establishing 
the number of Medicare and total base year outpatient services for each 
hospital.
    (3) The State must provide a detailed explanation of the reasons for 
any difference between the data or assumptions used for the separate 
projections.


<R05>
Sec. 403.322  Termination of agreements for Medicare recognition of State systems.

    (a) Termination of agreements. (1) HCFA may terminate any approved 
agreement if it finds, after the procedures described in this paragraph 
are followed that the State system does not satisfactorily meet the 
requirements of section 1886(c) of the Act or the regulations in this 
subpart. A termination must be effective on the last day of a calendar 
quarter.
    (2) HCFA will give the State reasonable notice of the proposed 
termination of an agreement and of the reasons for the termination at 
least 90 days before the effective date of the termination.
    (3) HCFA will give the State the opportunity to present evidence to 
refute the finding.
    (4) HCFA will issue a final notice of termination upon a final 
review and determination on the State's evidence.
    (b) Termination by State. A State may voluntarily terminate a State 
system by giving HCFA notice of its intent to terminate. A termination 
must be effective on the last day of a calendar quarter. The State must 
notify HCFA of its intent to terminate at least 90 days before the 
effective date of the termination.

         Subpart E--Beneficiary Counseling and Assistance Grants

    Source:  59 FR 51128, Oct. 7, 1994, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 403.500  Basis, scope, and definition.

    (a) Basis. This subpart implements, in part, the provisions of 
section 4360 of

[[Page 37]]

Public Law 101-508 by establishing a minimum level of funding for grants 
made to States for the purpose of providing information, counseling, and 
assistance relating to obtaining adequate and appropriate health 
insurance coverage to individuals eligible to receive benefits under the 
Medicare program.
    (b) Scope of subpart. This subpart sets forth the following:
    (1) Conditions of eligibility for the grant.
    (2) Minimum levels of funding for those States qualifying for the 
grants.
    (3) Reporting requirements.
    (c) Definition. For purposes of this subpart, the term ``State'' 
includes (except where otherwise indicated by the context) the 50 
States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the 
Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa.


<R05>
Sec. 403.501  Eligibility for grants.

    To be eligible for a grant under this subpart, the State must have 
an approved Medicare supplemental regulatory program under section 1882 
of the Act and submit a timely application to HCFA that meets the 
requirements of--
    (a) Section 4360 of Public Law 101-508 (42 USC 1395b-4);
    (b) This subpart; and
    (c) The applicable solicitation for grant applications issued by 
HCFA.


<R05>
Sec. 403.502  Availability of grants.

    HCFA awards funds to States subject to congressional appropriations 
of funds and, if applicable, subject to the satisfactory progress in the 
State's project during the preceding grant period. The criteria by which 
progress is evaluated and the performance standards for determining 
whether satisfactory progress has been made is specified in the notice 
of grant award sent to each State. HCFA advises each State as to when to 
make application and provides information as to the timing of the grant 
award and the duration of the grant award. HCFA also provides an 
estimate of the amount of funds that may be available to the State.


<R05>
Sec. 403.504  Number and size of grants.

    (a) General. HCFA awards the following types of grants:
    (1) New program grants.
    (2) Existing program enhancement grants.
    (b) Grant Award. Each eligible State that submits an acceptable 
application receives a grant including a fixed amount (minimum funding 
level) and a variable amount.
    (1) A fixed portion is awarded to States in the following amounts:
    (i) Each of the 50 States, $75,000.
    (ii) The District of Columbia, $75,000.
    (iii) Puerto Rico, $75,000.
    (iv) American Samoa, $25,000.
    (v) Guam, $25,000.
    (vi) The Virgin Islands, $25,000.
    (2) A variable portion, which is based on the number and location of 
Medicare beneficiaries residing in the State is awarded to each State. 
The variable amount a particular State receives is determined as set 
forth in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Calculation of variable portion of the grant. (1) HCFA bases the 
variable portion of the grant on--
    (i) The amount of available funds, and
    (ii) A comparison of each State with the average of all of the 
States (except the State being compared) with respect to three factors 
that relate to the size of the State's Medicare population and where 
that population resides.
    (2) The factors HCFA uses to compare States' Medicare populations 
comprise separate components of the variable amount. These factors, and 
the extent to which they each contribute to the variable amount, are as 
follows:
    (i) Approximately 75 percent of the variable amount is based on the 
number of Medicare beneficiaries living in the State as a percentage of 
all Medicare beneficiaries nationwide.
    (ii) Approximately 10 percent of the variable amount is based on the 
percentage of the State's total population who are Medicare 
beneficiaries.
    (iii) Approximately 15 percent of the variable amount is based on 
the percentage of the State's Medicare beneficiaries that reside in 
rural areas (``rural areas'' are defined as all areas not included 
within a Metropolitan Statistical Area).
    (3) Based on the foregoing four factors (that is, the amount of 
available

[[Page 38]]

funds and the three comparative factors), HCFA determines a variable 
rate for each participating State for each grant period.
    (d) Submission of revised budget. A State that receives an amount of 
grant funds under this subpart that differs from the amount requested in 
the budget submitted with its application must submit a revised budget 
to HCFA, along with its acceptance of the grant award, that reflects the 
amount awarded.


<R05>
Sec. 403.508  Limitations.

    (a) Use of grants. Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section, a State that receives a grant under this subpart may use the 
grant for any reasonable expenses incurred in planning, developing, 
implementing, and/or operating the program for which the grant is made.
    (b) Maintenance of effort. A State that receives a grant to 
supplement an existing program (that is, an existing program enhancement 
grant)--
    (1) Must not use the grant to supplant funds for activities that 
were conducted immediately preceding the date of the initial award of a 
grant made under this subpart and funded through other sources 
(including in-kind contributions).
    (2) Must maintain the activities of the program at least at the 
level that those activities were conducted immediately preceding the 
initial award of a grant made under this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 403.510  Reporting requirements.

    A State that receives a grant under this subpart must submit at 
least one annual report to HCFA and any additional reports as HCFA may 
prescribe in the notice of grant award. HCFA advises the State of the 
requirements concerning the frequency, timing, and contents of reports 
in the notice of grant award that it sends to the State.


<R05>
Sec. 403.512  Administration.

    (a) General. Administration of grants will be in accordance with the 
provisions of this subpart, 45 CFR part 92 (``Uniform Administrative 
Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local

                             Care Technology

    Authority:  Secs. 1102, 1861, 1862(a), 1871, 1874, and 1881 of the 
Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1302, 1395x, 1395y(a), 1395hh, 1395kk, 
and 1395rr), and sec. 353 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 
263a), unless otherwise noted.


    Source: 60 FR 48423, Sept. 19, 1995, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 405.201  Scope of subpart and definitions.

    (a) Scope. This subpart establishes that--
    (1) HCFA uses the FDA categorization of a device as a factor in 
making Medicare coverage decisions; and
    (2) HCFA may consider for Medicare coverage certain devices with an 
FDA-approved investigational device exemption (IDE) that have been 
categorized as non-experimental/investigational (Category B).
    (b) Definitions. As used in this subpart--
    Class I refers to devices for which the general controls of the 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, such as adherence to good manufacturing 
practice regulations, are sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance 
of safety and effectiveness.
    Class II refers to devices that, in addition to general controls, 
require special controls, such as performance standards or postmarket 
surveillance, to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and 
effectiveness.
    Class III refers to devices that cannot be classified into Class I 
or Class II because insufficient information exists to determine that 
either special or general controls would provide reasonable assurance of 
safety and effectiveness. Class III devices require premarket approval.
    Contractors refers to carriers, fiscal intermediaries, and other 
entities that contract with HCFA to review and adjudicate claims for 
Medicare services.
    Experimental/investigational (Category A) device refers to an 
innovative device believed to be in Class III for which ``absolute 
risk'' of the device type has not been established (that is, initial 
questions of safety and effectiveness have not been resolved and the FDA 
is unsure whether the device type can be safe and effective).
    IDE stands for investigational device exemption. An FDA-approved IDE 
application permits a device, which would otherwise be subject to 
marketing clearance, to be shipped lawfully for the purpose of 
conducting a clinical

[[Page 43]]

trial in accordance with 21 U.S.C. 360j(g) and 21 CFR parts 812 and 813.
    Non-experimental/investigational (Category B) device refers to a 
device believed to be in Class I or Class II, or a device believed to be 
in Class III for which the incremental risk is the primary risk in 
question (that is, underlying questions of safety and effectiveness of 
that device type have been resolved), or it is known that the device 
type can be safe and effective because, for example, other manufacturers 
have obtained FDA approval for that device type.
    PMA stands for ``premarket approval'' and refers to a marketing 
application for a Class III device, which includes all information 
submitted with or incorporated by reference in the application in 
accordance with 21 U.S.C. 360e and 360j and 21 CFR 814.3(e).
    Sponsor refers to a person or entity that initiates, but does not 
conduct, an investigation under an IDE.


<R05>
Sec. 405.203  FDA categorization of investigational devices.

    (a) The FDA assigns a device with an FDA-approved IDE to one of two 
categories:
    (1) Experimental/Investigational (Category A) Devices.
    (2) Non-Experimental/Investigational (Category B) Devices.
    (b) The FDA notifies HCFA, when it notifies the sponsor, that the 
device is categorized by FDA as experimental/investigational (Category 
A) or non-experimental/investigational (Category B).
    (c) HCFA uses the categorization of the device as a factor in making 
Medicare coverage decisions.


<R05>
Sec. 405.205  Coverage of a non-experimental/investigational (Category B) device.

    (a) For any device that meets the requirements of the exception at 
Sec. 411.15(o) of this chapter, the following procedures apply:
    (1) The FDA notifies HCFA, when it notifies the sponsor, that the 
device is categorized by FDA as non-experimental/investigational 
(Category B).
    (2) HCFA uses the categorization of the device as a factor in making 
Medicare coverage decisions.
    (b) If the FDA becomes aware that a categorized device no longer 
meets the requirements of the exception at Sec. 411.15(o) of this 
chapter, the FDA notifies the sponsor and HCFA and the procedures 
described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section apply.


<R05>
Sec. 405.207  Services related to a noncovered device.

    (a) When payment is not made. Medicare payment is not made for 
medical and hospital services that are related to the use of a device 
that is not covered because HCFA determines the device is not 
``reasonable'' and ``necessary'' under section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Act 
or because it is excluded from coverage for other reasons. These 
services include all services furnished in preparation for the use of a 
noncovered device, services furnished contemporaneously with and 
necessary to the use of a noncovered device, and services furnished as 
necessary after-care that are incident to recovery from the use of the 
device or from receiving related noncovered services.
    (b) When payment is made. Medicare payment may be made for services, 
ordinarily covered by Medicare, to treat a condition or complication 
that arises because of the use of a noncovered device or from the 
furnishing of related noncovered services.


<R05>
Sec. 405.209  Payment for a non-experimental/investigational (Category B) device.

    Payment under Medicare for a non-experimental/investigational 
(Category B) device is based on, and may not exceed, the amount that 
would have been paid for a currently used device serving the same 
medical purpose that has been approved or cleared for marketing by the 
FDA.


<R05>
Sec. 405.211  Procedures for Medicare contractors in making coverage decisions for a non-experimental/investigational (Category B) device.

    (a) General rule. In their review of claims for payment, Medicare 
contractors are bound by the statute, regulations, and all HCFA 
administrative issuances, including all national coverage decisions.

[[Page 44]]

    (b) Potentially covered non-experimental/investigational (Category 
B) devices. Medicare contractors may approve coverage for any device 
with an FDA-approved IDE categorized as a non-experimental/
investigational (Category B) device if all other coverage requirements 
are met.
    (c) Other considerations. Medicare contractors must consider whether 
any restrictions concerning site of service, indications for use, or any 
other list of conditions for coverage have been placed on the device's 
use.


<R05>
Sec. 405.213  Re-evaluation of a device categorization.

    (a) General rules. (1) Any sponsor that does not agree with an FDA 
decision that categorizes its device as experimental/investigational 
(Category A) may request re-evaluation of the categorization decision.
    (2) A sponsor may request review by HCFA only after the requirements 
of paragraph (b) of this section are met.
    (3) No reviews other than those described in paragraphs (b) and (c) 
of this section are available to the sponsor.
    (4) Neither the FDA original categorization or re-evaluation 
(described in paragraph (b) of this section) nor HCFA's review 
(described in paragraph (c) of this section) constitute an initial 
determination for purposes of the Medicare appeals processes under part 
405, subpart G or subpart H, or parts 417, 473, or 498 of this chapter.
    (b) Request to FDA. A sponsor that does not agree with the FDA's 
categorization of its device may submit a written request to the FDA at 
any time requesting re-evaluation of its original categorization 
decision, together with any information and rationale that it believes 
support recategorization. The FDA notifies both HCFA and the sponsor of 
its decision.
    (c) Request to HCFA. If the FDA does not agree to recategorize the 
device, the sponsor may seek review from HCFA. A device sponsor must 
submit its request in writing to HCFA. HCFA obtains copies of relevant 
portions of the application, the original categorization decision, and 
supplementary materials. HCFA reviews all material submitted by the 
sponsor and the FDA's recommendation. HCFA reviews only information in 
the FDA record to determine whether to change the categorization of the 
device. HCFA issues a written decision and notifies the sponsor of the 
IDE and the FDA.

    To the extent that HCFA relies on confidential commercial or trade 
secret information in any judicial proceeding, HCFA will maintain 
confidentiality of the information in accordance with Federal law.

services or other person with respect to any item or service furnished 
an individual shall be regarded as a payment to the individual, and 
adjustment shall be made pursuant to Secs. 405.352 through 405.358

services furnished the individual.
    (c) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a provider of 
services or other person shall, in the absence of evidence to the 
contrary, be deemed to be without fault if the determination of the 
carrier, the intermediary, or the Health Care Financing Administration 
that more than the correct amount was paid was made subsequent to the 
third year following the year in which notice was sent to such 
individual that such amount had been paid.

    Where an individual is liable for an incorrect payment (i.e., a 
payment made under Sec. 405.350(a) or Sec. 405.350(b)) adjustment is 
made (to the extent of such liability) by:
    (a) Decreasing any payment under title II of the Act, or under the 
Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, to which the individual is entitled; or
    (b) In the event of the individual's death before adjustment is 
completed, by decreasing any payment under title II of the Act, or under 
the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 payable to the estate of the 
individual or to any other person, that are based on the individual's 
earnings record (or compensation).

    As soon as practicable after any adjustment is determined to be 
necessary, the Secretary, for purposes of this subpart, shall certify 
the amount of the overpayment or payment (see Sec. 405.350) with respect 
to which the adjustment is to be made. If the adjustment is to be made

Sec. 405.355  Waiver of adjustment or recovery.

    (a) The provisions of Sec. 405.352 may not be applied and there may 
be no adjustment or recovery of an incorrect payment (i.e., a payment 
made under Sec. 405.350(a) or Sec. 405.350(b)) in any case where such 
incorrect payment has been made with respect to an individual who is 
without fault, or where such adjustment or recovery would be made by 
decreasing payments to which another person who is without fault is 
entitled as provided in section 1870(b) of the Act where such adjustment 
or recovery would defeat the purpose of title II or title XVIII of the 
Act or would be against equity and good conscience. (See 20 CFR 404.509 
and 404.512.)
    (b) Adjustment or recovery of an incorrect payment (or only such 
part of an incorrect payment as may be determined to be inconsistent 
with the purposes of Title XVIII of the Act) against an individual who 
is without fault shall be deemed to be against equity and

[[Page 46]]

good conscience if the determination that such payment was incorrect was 
made subsequent to the third year following the year in which notice of 
such payment was sent to such individual. (See Secs. 405.330-405.332 for 
conditions under which payment may be made for items or services 
furnished after October 30, 1972 which are noncovered by reasons of 
Sec. 405.310 (g) and (k).)

    Whenever an initial determination is made that more than the correct 
amount of payment has been made, notice of the provisions of section 
1870(c) of the Act regarding waiver of adjustment or recovery shall be 
sent to the overpaid individual and to any other individual against whom 
adjustment or recovery of the overpayment is to be effected (see 
Sec. 405.358).

[61 FR 49271, Sept. 19, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 405.358  When waiver of adjustment or recovery may be applied.

title XVIII (hospital and supplementary medical insurance benefits) has 
been made (including a payment under section 1814(e) of the Act with 
respect to an individual:
    (a) Who is without fault, and
    (b) Adjustment or recovery would either:
    (1) Defeat the purposes of title II or title XVIII of the Act, or
    (2) Be against equity and good conscience.

  Suspension and Recoupment of Payment to Providers and Suppliers and 
                Collection and Compromise of Overpayments


<R05>
Sec. 405.370   Definitions.

    For purposes of this subpart, the following definitions apply:
    Offset. The recovery by Medicare of a non-Medicare debt by reducing 
present or future Medicare payments and applying the amount withheld to 
the indebtedness. (Examples are Public Health Service debts or Medicaid 
debts recovered by HCFA).
    Recoupment. The recovery by Medicare of any outstanding Medicare 
debt by reducing present or future Medicare payments and applying the 
amount withheld to the indebtedness.
    Suspension of payment. The withholding of payment by an intermediary 
or carrier from a provider or supplier of an approved Medicare payment 
amount before a determination of the amount of the overpayment exists.

[61 FR 63745, Dec. 2, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 405.371   Suspension, offset, and recoupment of Medicare payments to providers and suppliers of services.

    (a) General. Medicare payments to providers and suppliers, as 
authorized under this subchapter (excluding payments to beneficiaries), 
may be--
    (1) Suspended, in whole or in part, by HCFA, an intermediary, or a 
carrier if HCFA, the intermediary, or the carrier possesses reliable 
information that an overpayment or fraud or willful misrepresentation 
exists or that the payments to be made may not be correct, although 
additional evidence may be needed for a determination; or

[[Page 47]]

    (2) Offset or recouped, in whole or in part, by an intermediary or a 
carrier if the intermediary, carrier, or HCFA has determined that the 
provider or supplier to whom payments are to be made has been overpaid.
    (b) Steps necessary for suspension of payment, offset, and 
recoupment. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, HCFA, 
the intermediary, or carrier suspends payments only after it has 
complied with the procedural requirements set forth at Sec. 405.372. The 
intermediary or carrier offsets or recoups payments only after it has 
complied with the procedural requirements set forth at Sec. 405.373.
    (c) Suspension of payment in the case of unfiled cost reports. If a 
provider has failed to timely file an acceptable cost report, payment to 
the provider is immediately suspended until a cost report is filed and 
determined by the intermediary to be acceptable. In the case of an 
unfiled cost report, the provisions of Sec. 405.372 do not apply. (See 
Sec. 405.372(a)(2) concerning failure to furnish other information.)

[61 FR 63746, Dec. 2, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 405.372   Proceeding for suspension of payment.

    (a) Notice of intention to suspend--(1) General rule. Except as 
provided in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(4) of this section, if the 
intermediary, carrier, or HCFA has determined that a suspension of 
payments under Sec. 405.371(a)(1) should be put into effect, the 
intermediary or carrier must notify the provider or supplier of the 
intention to suspend payments, in whole or in part, and the reasons for 
making the suspension.
    (2) Failure to furnish information. The notice requirement of 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply if the intermediary or 
carrier suspends payments to a provider or supplier in accordance with 
section 1815(a) or section 1833(e) of the Act, respectively, because the 
provider or supplier has failed to submit information requested by the 
intermediary or carrier that is needed to determine the amounts due the 
provider or supplier. (See Sec. 405.371(c) concerning failure to file 
timely acceptable cost reports.)
    (3) Harm to Trust Funds. A suspension of payment may be imposed 
without prior notice if HCFA, the intermediary, or carrier determines 
that the Medicare Trust Funds would be harmed by giving prior notice. 
HCFA may base its determination on an intermediary's or carrier's belief 
that giving prior notice would hinder the possibility of recovering the 
money.
    (4) Fraud or misrepresentation. If the intended suspension of 
payment involves suspected fraud or misrepresentation, HCFA determines 
whether to impose the suspension and if prior notice is appropriate. 
HCFA directs the intermediary or carrier as to the timing and content of 
the notification to the provider or supplier. HCFA is the real party in 
interest and is responsible for the decision. HCFA may base its decision 
on information from the intermediary, carrier, law enforcement agencies, 
or other sources. HCFA determines whether the information is reliable.
    (b) Rebuttal--(1) If prior notice is required. If prior notice is 
required under paragraph (a) of this section, the intermediary or 
carrier must give the provider or supplier an opportunity for rebuttal 
in accordance with Sec. 405.374. If a rebuttal statement is received 
within the specified time period, the suspension of payment goes into 
effect on the date stated in the notice, and the procedures and 
provisions set forth in Sec. 405.375 apply. If by the end of the period 
specified in the notice no statement has been received, the suspension 
goes into effect automatically, and the procedures set forth in 
paragraph (c) of this section are followed.
    (2) If prior notice is not required. If, under the provisions of 
paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(4) of this section, a suspension of 
payment is put into effect without prior notice to the provider or 
supplier, the intermediary or carrier must, once the suspension is in 
effect, give the provider or supplier an opportunity to submit a 
rebuttal statement as to why the suspension should be removed.
    (c) Subsequent action. If a suspension of payment is put into 
effect, the intermediary, carrier, or HCFA takes timely action after the 
suspension to obtain the additional evidence it may

[[Page 48]]

need to make a determination as to whether an overpayment exists or the 
payments may be made. The intermediary, carrier, or HCFA makes all 
reasonable efforts to expedite the determination. As soon as the 
determination is made, the intermediary or carrier informs the provider 
or supplier and, if appropriate, the suspension is rescinded or any 
existing recoupment or offset is adjusted to take into account the 
determination.
    (d) Duration of suspension of payment--(1) General rule. Except as 
provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, a suspension 
of payment is limited to 180 days, starting with the date the suspension 
begins.
    (2) 180-day extension. (i) An intermediary, a carrier, or, in cases 
of fraud and misrepresentation, OIG or a law enforcement agency, may 
request a one-time only extension of the suspension period for up to 180 
additional days if it is unable to complete its examination of the 
information or investigation, as appropriate, within the 180-day time 
limit. The request must be submitted in writing to HCFA.
    (ii) Upon receipt of a request for an extension, HCFA notifies the 
provider or supplier of the requested extension. HCFA then either 
extends the suspension of payment for up to an additional 180 days or 
determines that the suspended payments are to be released to the 
provider or supplier.
    (3) Exceptions to the time limits. (i) The time limits specified in 
paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section do not apply if the case 
has been referred to, and is being considered by, the OIG for 
administrative action (for example, civil money penalties).
    (ii) HCFA may grant an extension in addition to the extension 
provided under paragraph (d)(2) of this section if the Department of 
Justice submits a written request to HCFA that the suspension of payment 
be continued based on the ongoing investigation and anticipated filing 
of criminal and/or civil actions. At a minimum, the request must include 
the following:
    (A) Identification of the entity under suspension.
    (B) The amount of time needed for continued suspension in order to 
implement the criminal and/or civil proceedings.
    (C) A statement of why and/or how criminal and/or civil actions may 
be affected if the requested extension is not granted.
    (e) Disposition of suspended payments. Payments suspended under the 
authority of Sec. 405.371(b) are first applied to reduce or eliminate 
any overpayments determined by the intermediary, carrier, or HCFA, 
including any interest assessed under the provisions of Sec. 405.378, 
and then applied to reduce any other obligation to HCFA or to HHS. In 
the absence of a legal requirement that the excess be paid to another 
entity, the excess is released to the provider or supplier.

[61 FR 63746, Dec. 2, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 405.373  Proceeding for offset or recoupment.

    (a) General rule. Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section, if the intermediary, carrier, or HCFA has determined that an 
offset or recoupment of payments under Sec. 405.371(a)(2) should be put 
into effect, the intermediary or carrier must--
    (1) Notify the provider or supplier of its intention to offset or 
recoup payment, in whole or in part, and the reasons for making the 
offset or recoupment; and
    (2) Give the provider or supplier an opportunity for rebuttal in 
accordance with Sec. 405.374.
    (b) Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply if the 
intermediary, after furnishing a provider a written notice of the amount 
of program reimbursement in accordance with Sec. 405.1803, recoups 
payment under paragraph (c) of Sec. 405.1803. (For provider rights in 
this circumstance, see Secs. 405.1809, 405.1811, 405.1815, 405.1835, and 
405.1843.)
    (c) Actions following receipt of rebuttal statement. If a provider 
or supplier submits, in accordance with Sec. 405.374, a statement as to 
why an offset or recoupment should not be put into effect on the date 
specified in the notice, the intermediary or carrier must comply with 
the time limits and notification requirements of Sec. 405.375.
    (d) No rebuttal statement received. If, by the end of the time 
period specified in the notice, no statement has been

[[Page 49]]

received, the recoupment or offset goes into effect automatically.
    (e) Duration of recoupment or offset. If a recoupment or offset is 
put into effect, it remains in effect until the earliest of the 
following:
    (1) The overpayment and any assessed interest are liquidated.
    (2) The intermediary or carrier obtains a satisfactory agreement 
from the provider or supplier for liquidation of the overpayment.
    (3) The intermediary or carrier, on the basis of subsequently 
acquired evidence or otherwise, determines that there is no overpayment.

[61 FR 63747, Dec. 2, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 405.374  Opportunity for rebuttal.

    (a) General rule. If prior notice of the suspension of payment, 
offset, or recoupment is given under Sec. 405.372 or Sec. 405.373, the 
intermediary or carrier must give the provider or supplier an 
opportunity, before the suspension, offset, or recoupment takes effect, 
to submit any statement (to include any pertinent information) as to why 
it should not be put into effect on the date specified in the notice. 
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the provider or 
supplier has at least 15 days following the date of notification to 
submit the statement.
    (b) Exception. The intermediary or carrier may for cause--
    (1) Impose a shorter period for rebuttal; or
    (2) Extend the time within which the statement must be submitted.

[61 FR 63747, Dec. 2, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 405.375  Time limits for, and notification of, administrative determination after receipt of rebuttal statement.

    (a) Submission and disposition of evidence. If the provider or 
supplier submits a statement, under Sec. 405.374, as to why a suspension 
of payment, offset, or recoupment should not be put into effect, or, 
under Sec. 405.372(b)(2), why a suspension should be terminated, HCFA, 
the intermediary, or carrier must within 15 days, from the date the 
statement is received, consider the statement (including any pertinent 
evidence submitted), together with any other material bearing upon the 
case, and determine whether the facts justify the suspension, offset, or 
recoupment or, if already initiated, justify the termination of the 
suspension, offset, or recoupment. Suspension, offset, or recoupment is 
not delayed beyond the date stated in the notice in order to review the 
statement.
    (b) Notification of determination. The intermediary or carrier must 
send written notice of the determination made under paragraph (a) of 
this section to the provider or supplier. The notice must--
    (1) In the case of offset or recoupment, contain rationale for the 
determination; and
    (2) In the case of suspension of payment, contain specific findings 
on the conditions upon which the suspension is initiated, continued, or 
removed and an explanatory statement of the determination.
    (c) Determination is not appealable. A determination made under 
paragraph (a) of this section is not an initial determination and is not 
appealable.

[61 FR 63747, Dec. 2, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 405.376  Suspension and termination of collection action and compromise of claims for overpayment.

    (a) Basis and purpose. This section contains requirements and 
procedures for the compromise of, or suspension or termination of 
collection action on, claims for overpayments against a provider or a 
supplier under the Medicare program. It is adopted under the authority 
of the Federal Claims Collection Act (31 U.S.C. 3711). Collection and 
compromise of claims against Medicare beneficiaries are explained at 20 
CFR 404.515.
    (b) Definitions. As used in this section, debtor means a provider of 
services or a physician or other supplier of services that has been 
overpaid under title XVIII of the Social Security Act. It includes an 
individual, partnership, corporation, estate, trust, or other legal 
entity.
    (c) Basic conditions. A claim for recovery of Medicare overpayments 
against a debtor may be compromised, or collection action on it may be 
suspended or terminated, by the Health Care Financing Administration 
(HCFA) if;

[[Page 50]]

    (1) The claim does not exceed $100,000, or such higher amount as the 
Attorney General may from time to time prescribe, exclusive of interest; 
and
    (2) There is no indication of fraud, the filing of a false claim, or 
misrepresentation on the part of the debtor or any director, partner, 
manager, or other party having an interest in the claim.
    (d) Basis for compromise. A claim may be compromised for one or more 
of the following reasons:
    (1) The debtor, or the estate of a deceased debtor, does not have 
the present or prospective ability to pay the full amount within a 
reasonable time;
    (2) The debtor refuses to pay the claim in full and the United 
States is unable to collect the full amount within a reasonable time by 
legal proceedings;
    (3) There is real doubt the United States can prove its case in 
court; or
    (4) The cost of collecting the claim does not justify enforced 
collection of the full amount.
    (e) Basis for termination of collection action.  Collection action 
may be terminated for one or more of the following reasons:
    (1) The United States cannot enforce collection of any significant 
sum;
    (2) The debtor cannot be located, there is no security to be 
liquidated, the statute of limitations has run, and the prospects of 
collecting by offset are too remote to justify retention of the claim;
    (3) The cost of further collection action is likely to exceed any 
recovery;
    (4) It is determined the claim is without merit; or
    (5) Evidence to substantiate the claim is no longer available.
    (f) Basis for suspension of collection action. Collection action may 
be suspended for either of the following reasons if future collection 
action is justified based on potential productivity, including 
foreseeable ability to pay, and size of claim:
    (1) The debtor cannot be located; or
    (2) The debtor is unable to make payments on the claim or to fulfill 
an acceptable compromise.
    (g) Factors considered. In determining whether a claim will be 
compromised, or collection action terminated or suspended, HCFA will 
consider the following factors:
    (1) Age and health of the debtor, present and potential income, 
inheritance prospects, possible concealment or fraudulent transfer of 
assets, and the availability of assets which may be reached by enforced 
collection proceedings, for compromise under paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section, termination under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, and 
suspension under paragraph (f)(2) of this section;
    (2) Applicable exemptions available to a debtor and uncertainty 
concerning the price of the property in a forced sale, for compromise 
under paragraph (d)(2) of this section and termination under paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section; and
    (3) The probability of proving the claim in court, the probability 
of full or partial recovery, the availability of necessary evidence, and 
related pragmatic considerations, for compromise under paragraph (d)(3) 
of this section.
    (h) Amount of compromise. The amount accepted in compromise will be 
reasonable in relation to the amount that can be recovered by enforced 
collection proceedings.

Consideration shall be given to the following:
    (1) The exemptions available to the debtor under State or Federal 
law;
    (2) The time necessary to collect the overpayment;
    (3) The litigative probabilities involved; and
    (4) The administrative and litigative costs of collection where the 
cost of collecting the claim is a basis for compromise.
    (i) Payment of compromise--(1) Time and manner. Payment of the 
amount that HCFA has agreed to accept as a compromise in full settlement 
of a Medicare overpayment claim must be made within the time and in the 
manner prescribed by HCFA. An overpayment claim is not compromised or 
settled until the full payment of the compromised amount has been made 
within the time and in the manner prescribed by HCFA.
    (2) Failure to pay compromised amount. Failure of the debtor or the 
estate to

[[Page 51]]

make payment as provided by the comprise reinstates the full amount of 
the overpayment claim, less any amounts paid prior to the default.
    (j) Effect of compromise, or suspension, or termination of 
collection action. Any action taken by HCFA under this section regarding 
the compromise of an overpayment claim, or termination or suspension of 
collection action on an overpayment claim, is not an initial 
determination for purposes of the appeal procedures under subparts G, H,

Sec. 405.377  Withholding Medicare payments to recover Medicaid overpayments.

    (a) Basis and purpose. This section implements section 1885 of the 
Act, which provides for withholding Medicare payments to certain 
Medicaid providers that have not arranged to repay Medicaid overpayments 
as determined by the Medicaid State agency or have failed to provide 
information necessary to determine the amount (if any) of overpayments.
    (b) When withholding may be used. HCFA may withhold Medicare payment 
to offset Medicaid overpayments that a Medicaid agency has been unable 
to collect if--
    (1) The Medicaid agency has followed the procedure specified in 
Sec. 447.31 of this chapter; and
    (2) The institution or person is one described in paragraph (c) of 
this section and either--
    (i) Has not made arrangements satisfactory to the Medicaid agency to 
repay the overpayment; or
    (ii) Has not provided information to the Medicaid agency necessary 
to enable the agency to determine the existence or amount of Medicaid 
overpayment.
    (c) Institutions or persons affected. Withholding under paragraph 
(b) of this section may be made with respect to any of the following 
entities that has or had in effect an agreement with a Medicaid agency 
to furnish services under an approved Medicaid State plan:
    (1) An institutional provider that has in effect an agreement under 
section 1866 of the Act. (Part 489 (Provider and Supplier Agreements) 
implements section 1866 of the Act.)
    (2) A physician or supplier that has accepted payment on the basis 
of an assignment under section 1842(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act. (Section 
424.55 sets forth the conditions a supplier agrees to in accepting 
assignment.)
    (d) Amount to be withheld. (1) HCFA contacts the appropriate 
intermediary or carrier to determine the amount of Medicare payment to 
which the institution or person is entitled.
    (2) HCFA may require the intermediary or carrier to withhold 
Medicare payments to the institution or person by the lesser of the 
following amounts:
    (i) The amount of the Medicare payments to which the institution or 
person would otherwise be entitled.
    (ii) The total Medicaid overpayment to the institution or person.
    (e) Notice of withholding. If HCFA intends to withhold payments 
under this section, it notifies by certified mail, return receipt 
requested, the institution or person and the appropriate intermediary or 
carrier of the intention to withhold Medicare payments and follows the 
procedure in Sec. 405.374. The notice includes--
    (1) Identification of the institution or person; and
    (2) The amount of Medicaid overpayment to be withheld from payments 
to which the institution or person would otherwise be entitled under 
Medicare.
    (f) Termination of withholding. HCFA terminates the withholding if--
    (1) The Medicaid overpayment is completely recovered;
    (2) The institution or person enters into an agreement satisfactory 
to the Medicaid agency to repay the overpayment; or
    (3) The Medicaid agency determines that there is no overpayment 
based on newly acquired evidence or a subsequent audit.
    (g) Disposition of funds withheld. HCFA releases amounts withheld 
under this section to the Medicaid agency to be applied against the 
Medicaid overpayment made by the State agency.

Sec. 405.378  Interest charges on overpayment and underpayments to providers, suppliers, and other entities.

    (a) Basis and purpose. This section, which implements sections 
1815(d) and 1833(j) of the common law and Act, and authority granted 
under the Federal Claims Collection Act, provides for the charging and 
payment of interest on overpayments and underpayments to Medicare 
providers, suppliers, HMOs, competitive medical plans (CMPs), and health 
care prepayment plans (HCPPs).
    (b) Basic rules. (1) HCFA will charge interest on overpayments, and 
pay interest on underpayments, to providers and suppliers of services 
(including physicians and other practitioners), except as specified in 
paragraphs (f) and (h) of this section.
    (2) Interest will accrue from the date of the final determination as 
defined in paragraph (c) of this section, and will either be charged on 
the overpayment balance or paid on the underpayment balance for each 30-
day period that payment is delayed. (Periods of less than 30 days will 
be treated as a full 30-day period, and the 30-day interest charge will 
be applied to any balance.)
    (c) Definition of final determination. (1) For purposes of this 
section, any of the following constitutes a final determination:
    (i) A Notice of Amount of Program Reimbursement (NPR) is issued, as 
discussed in Secs. 405.1803, 417.576, and 417.810, and either--
    (A) A written demand for payment is made; or
    (B) A written determination of an underpayment is made by the 
intermediary after a cost report is filed.
    (ii) In cases in which an NPR is not used as a notice of 
determination (that is, primarily under part B), one of the following 
determinations is issued--
    (A) A written determination that an overpayment exists and a written 
demand for payment;
    (B) A written determination of an underpayment; or
    (C) An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) decision that reduces the 
amount of an overpayment below the amount that HCFA has already 
collected.
    (iii) Other examples of cases in which an NPR is not used are 
carrier reasonable charge determinations under subpart E of this part, 
interim cost settlements made for HMOs, CMPs, and HCPPs under 
Secs. 417.574 and 417.810(e) of this chapter, and initial retroactive 
adjustment determinations under Sec. 413.64(f)(2) of this chapter. In 
the case of interim cost settlements and initial retroactive adjustment 
determinations, if the debtor does not dispute the adjustment 
determination within the timeframe designated in the notice of the 
determination (generally at least 15 days), a final determination is 
deemed to have been made. If the provider or supplier does dispute 
portions of the determination, a final determination is deemed to have 
been made on those portions when the intermediary issues a new 
determination in response to the dispute.
    (iv) The due date of a timely-filed cost report that indicates an 
amount is due HCFA, and is not accompanied by payment in full. (If an 
additional overpayment or underpayment is determined by the carrier or 
intermediary, a final determination on the additional amount is made in 
accordance with paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(1)(iii), of 
this section.)
    (v) With respect to a cost report that is not filed on time, the day 
following the date the cost report was due (plus a single extension of 
time not to exceed 30 days if granted for good cause), until the time as 
a cost report is filed. (When the cost report is subsequently filed, 
there is an additional determination as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) 
(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section.)
    (2) Except as required by any subsequent administrative or judicial 
reversal, interest accrues from the date of final determination as 
specified in this subsection.
    (d) Rate of interest. (1) The interest rate on overpayments and 
underpayments is the higher of--
    (i) The rate as fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury after taking 
into consideration private consumer rates of interest prevailing on the 
date of final determination as defined in paragraph

[[Page 53]]

(c) of this section (this rate is published quarterly in the Federal 
Register by the Department under 45 CFR 30.13(a)); or
    (ii) The current value of funds rate (this rate is published 
annually in the Federal Register by the Secretary of the Treasury, 
subject to quarterly revisions).
    (2) [Reserved]
    (e) Accrual of interest. (1) If a cost report is filed that does not 
indicate an amount is due HCFA but the intermediary makes a final 
determination that an overpayment exists, or if a carrier makes a final 
determination that an overpayment to a physician or supplier exists, 
interest will accrue beginning with the date of such final 
determination. Interest will continue to accrue during periods of 
administrative and judicial appeal and until final disposition of the 
claim.
    (2)(i) If a cost report is filed and indicates that an amount is due 
HCFA, interest on the amount due will accrue from the due date of the 
cost report unless--
    (A) Full payment on the amount due accompanies the cost report; or
    (B) The provider and the intermediary agree in advance to liquidate 
the overpayment through a reduction in interim payments over the next 
30-day period.
    (ii) If the intermediary determines an additional overpayment during 
the cost settlement process, interest will accrue from the date of each 
determination.
    (iii) The interest rate on each of the final determinations of an 
overpayment will be the rate of interest in effect on the date the 
determination is made.
    (3) In the case of a cost report that is not filed on time, interest 
also will accrue on a determined overpayment from the day following the 
due date of the report (plus a single extension of time not to exceed 30 
days if granted for good cause, as specified in Sec. 413.24(f)) of this 
chapter, to the time the cost report is filed.
    (4) If an intermediary or a carrier makes a final determination that 
an underpayment exists, interest to the provider or the supplier will 
accrue from the date of notification of the underpayment.
    (f) Waiver of interest charges. (1) When an intermediary or a 
carrier makes a final determination that an overpayment or underpayment 
exists, as specified in paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2)(ii), and (e)(4)--
    (i) Interest charges will be waived if the overpayment or 
underpayment is completely liquidated within 30 days from the date of 
the final determination.
    (ii) HCFA may waive interest charges if it determines that the 
administrative cost of collecting them exceeds the interest charges.
    (2) Interest will not be waived for that period of time during which 
the cost report was due but remained unfiled for more than 30 days, as 
specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
    (g) Rules applicable to partial payments. If an overpayment is 
repaid in installments or recouped by withholding from several payments 
due the provider or supplier of services--
    (1) Each payment or recoupment will be applied first to accrued 
interest and then to the principal; and
    (2) After each payment or recoupment, interest will accrue on the 
remaining unpaid balance.
    (h) Exceptions to applicability. (1) The provisions of this section 
do not apply to the time period for which interest is payable under 
Sec. 413.64(j) of this chapter because the provider seeks judicial 
review of a decision of the Provider Reimbursement Review Board, or a 
subsequent reversal, affirmance, or modification of that decision by the 
Administrator. Prior to that time, until the provider seeks judicial 
review, interest accrues at the rate specified in this section on 
outstanding unpaid balances resulting from final determinations as 
defined in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) If an overpayment or an underpayment determination is reversed 
administratively or judicially, and the reversal is no longer subject to 
appeal, appropriate adjustments will be made with respect to the 
overpayment or underpayment and the amount of interest charged.

[[Page 54]]

    (i) Nonallowable cost. As specified in Secs. 412.113 and 413.153 of 
this chapter, interest accrued on overpayments and interest on funds 
borrowed specifically to repay overpayments are not considered allowable 
costs, up to the amount of the overpayment, unless the provider had made 
a prior commitment to borrow funds for other purposes (for example, 
capital improvements).

(See Sec. 413.153(a)(2) of this chapter for exceptions based on 
administrative or judicial reversal.)

                   Repayment of Scholarships and Loans


<R05>
Sec. 405.380  Collection of past-due amounts on scholarship and loan programs.

    (a) Basis and purpose. This section implements section 1892 of the 
Act, which authorizes the Secretary to deduct from Medicare payments for 
services amounts considered as past-due obligations under the National 
Health Service Corps Scholarship program, the Physician Shortage Area 
Scholarship program, and the Health Education Assistance Loan program.
    (b) Offsetting against Medicare payment. (1) Medicare carriers and 
intermediaries offset against Medicare payments in accordance with the 
signed repayment agreement between the Public Health Service and 
individuals who have breached their scholarship or loan obligations and 
who--
    (i) Accept Medicare assignment for services;
    (ii) Are employed by or affiliated with a provider, HMO, or 
Competitive Medical Plan (CMP) that receives Medicare payment for 
services; or
    (iii) Are members of a group practice that receives Medicare payment 
for services.
    (2) For purposes of this section, ``provider'' includes all entities 
eligible to receive Medicare payment in accordance with an agreement 
under section 1866 of the Act.
    (c) Beginning of offset. (1) The Medicare carrier offsets Medicare 
payments beginning six months after it notifies the individual or the 
group practice of the amount to be deducted and the particular 
individual to whom the deductions are attributable.
    (2) The Medicare intermediary offsets payments beginning six months 
after it notifies the provider, HMO, CMP or group practice of the amount 
to be deducted and the particular individuals to whom the deductions are 
attributable. Offset of payments is made in accordance with the terms of 
the repayment agreement. If the individual ceases to be employed by the 
provider, HMO, or CMP, or leaves the group practice, no deduction is 
made.
    (d) Refusal to offset against Medicare payment. If the individual 
refuses to enter into a repayment agreement, or breaches any provision 
of the agreement, or if Medicare payment is insufficient to maintain the 
offset collection according to the agreed upon formula, then--
    (1) The Department, within 30 days if feasible, informs the Attorney 
General; and
    (2) The Department excludes the individual from Medicare until the 
entire past due obligation has been repaid, unless the individual is a 
sole community practitioner or the sole source of essential specialized 
services in a community and the State requests that the individual not 
be excluded.

<R05>
Sec. 405.501  Determination of reasonable charges.

    (a) Except as specified in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this 
section, Medicare pays no more for Part B medical and other health 
services than the ``reasonable charge'' for such service. The reasonable 
charge is determined by the carriers (subject to any deductible and 
coinsurance amounts as specified in Secs. 410.152 and 410.160 of this 
chapter).
    (b) Part B of Medicare pays on the basis of ``reasonable cost'' (see 
part 413 of this chapter) for certain institutional services, certain 
services furnished under arrangements with institutions, and services 
furnished by entities that elect to be paid on a cost basis (including 
health maintenance organizations, rural health clinics, Federally 
qualified health centers and end-stage renal disease facilities).
    (c) Carriers will determine the reasonable charge on the basis of 
the criteria specified in Sec. 405.502, and the customary and prevailing 
charge screens in effect when the service was furnished. (Also see 
Secs. 415.55 through 415.70 and Secs. 415.100 through 415.130 of this 
chapter, which pertain to the determination of reimbursement for 
services performed by hospital-based physicians.) However, when services 
are furnished more than 12 months before the beginning of the fee screen 
year (January 1 through December 30) in which a request for payment is 
made, payment is based on the customary and prevailing charge screens in 
effect for the fee screen year that ends immediately preceding the fee 
screen year in which the claim or request for payment is made.
    (d) Payment under Medicare Part B for durable medical equipment and 
prosthetic and orthotic devices is determined in accordance with the 
provisions of subpart D of part 414 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 405.502  Criteria for determining reasonable charges.

    (a) Criteria. The law allows for flexibility in the determination of 
reasonable charges to accommodate reimbursement to the various ways in 
which health services are furnished and charged for. The criteria for 
determining what charges are reasonable include:
    (1) The customary charges for similar services generally made by the 
physician or other person furnishing such services.
    (2) The prevailing charges in the locality for similar services.
    (3) In the case of physicians' services, the prevailing charges 
adjusted to reflect economic changes as provided under Sec. 405.504 of 
this subpart.
    (4) In the case of medical services, supplies, and equipment that 
are reimbursed on a reasonable charge basis (excluding physicians' 
services), the inflation-indexed charge as determined under 
Sec. 405.509.
    (5) [Reserved]
    (6) In the case of medical services, supplies, and equipment 
(including equipment servicing) that the Secretary judges do not 
generally vary significantly in quality from one supplier to another, 
the lowest charge levels at which such services, supplies, and equipment 
are widely and consistently available in a locality.
    (7) Other factors that may be found necessary and appropriate with 
respect to a category of service to use in judging whether the charge is 
inherently reasonable. This includes special reasonable charge limits 
(which may be either upper or lower limits) established by HCFA or a 
carrier if it determines that the standard rules for calculating 
reasonable charges set forth in this subpart result in the grossly 
deficient or excessive charges. The determination of these limits is 
described in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section.
    (8) In the case of laboratory services billed by a physician but 
performed by an outside laboratory, the payment levels established in 
accordance with the criteria stated in Sec. 405.515.
    (9) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(10) of this section, in the 
case of services of assistants-at-surgery as defined in Sec. 405.580 in 
teaching and non-teaching settings, charges that are not more than 16 
percent of the prevailing charge in the locality, adjusted by the 
economic index, for the surgical procedure performed by the primary 
surgeon. Payment is prohibited for the services of an assistant-at-
surgery in surgical procedures for which HCFA has determined that 
assistants-at-surgery on average are used in less than 5 percent of such 
procedures nationally.
    (10) In the case of services of assistants at surgery that meet the 
exception under Sec. 415.190(c)(2) or (c)(3) of this chapter because the 
physician is performing a unique, necessary, specialized medical service 
in the total care of a patient during surgery, reasonable charges 
consistent with prevailing practice in the carrier's service area rather 
than the special assistant at surgery rate.
    (b) Comparable services limitation. The law also specifies that the 
reasonable charge cannot be higher than the charge applicable for a 
comparable service under comparable circumstances to the carriers' own 
policyholders and subscribers.
    (c) Application of criteria. In applying these criteria, the 
carriers are to exercise judgment based on factual data on the charges 
made by physicians to patients generally and by other persons to the 
public in general and on special factors that may exist in individual 
cases so that determinations of reasonable charge are realistic and 
equitable.
    (d) Responsibility of Administration and carriers. Determinations by 
carriers of reasonable charge are not reviewed on a case-by-case basis 
by the Health Care Financing Administration, although the general 
procedures and performance of functions by carriers are evaluated. In 
making determinations, carriers apply the provisions of the law under 
broad principles issued by the Health Care Financing Administration. 
These principles are intended to assure overall consistency among 
carriers in their determinations of reasonable charge. The principles in 
Secs. 405.503 through 405.507 establish the criteria for making such 
determinations in accordance with the statutory provisions.
    (e) Determination of reasonable charges under the End-Stage Renal 
Disease

[[Page 57]]

(ESRD) Program--(1) General. Reasonable charges for renal-related items 
and services (furnished in connection with transplantation or dialysis) 
must be related to costs and allowances that are reasonable when the 
treatments are furnished in an effective and economical manner.
    (2) Nonprovider (independent) dialysis facilities. Reasonable 
charges for renal-related items and services furnished before August 1, 
1983 must be determined related to costs and charges prior to July, 
1973, in accordance with the regulations at Sec. 405.541. Items and 
services related to outpatient maintenance dialysis that are furnished 
after that date are paid for in accordance with Secs. 405.544 and 
413.170 of this chapter.
    (3) Provider services and (hospital-based) dialysis facilities. 
Renal-related items and services furnished by providers, or by ESRD 
facilities based in hospitals, before August 1, 1983 are paid for under 
the provider reimbursement provisions found generally in part 413 of 
this chapter. Items and services related to outpatient maintenance 
dialysis that are furnished after that date are paid for in accordance 
with Secs. 405.544 and 413.170 of this chapter.
    (4) Physicians' services. Reasonable charges for renal-related 
physicians' services must be determined considering charges made for 
other services involving comparable physicians' time and skill 
requirements, in accordance with regulations at Secs. 405.542 and 
405.543.
    (5) Health maintenance organizations (HMOs). For special rules 
concerning the reimbursement of ESRD services furnished by risk-basis 
HMOs, or by facilities owned or operated by or related to such HMOs by 
common ownership or control, see Secs. 405.2042(b)(14) and 405.2050(c).
    (f) Determining payments for certain physician services furnished in 
outpatient hospital settings--(1) General rule. If physician services of 
the type routinely furnished in physicians' offices are furnished in 
outpatient hospital settings before January 1, 1992, carriers determine 
the reasonable charge for those services by applying the limits 
described in paragraph (f)(5) of this section.
    (2) Definition. As used in this paragraph (f), outpatient settings 
means--
    (i) Hospital outpatient departments, including clinics and emergency 
rooms; and
    (ii) Comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facilities.
    (3) Services covered by limits. The carrier establishes a list of 
services routinely furnished in physicians' offices in the area. The 
carrier has the discretion to determine which professional services are 
routinely furnished in physicians' offices, based on current medical 
practice in the area. Listed below are some examples of routine services 
furnished by office-based physicians.

                                Examples

    Review of recent history, determination of blood pressure, 
ausculation of heart and lungs, and adjustment of medication.
    Brief history and examination, and initiation of diagnostic and 
treatment programs.
    Treatment of an acute respiratory infection.

    (4) Services excluded from limits. The limits established under this 
paragraph do not apply to the following:
    (i) Rural health clinic services.
    (ii) Surgical services included on the ambulatory surgical center 
list of procedures published under Sec. 416.65(c) of this chapter.
    (iii) Services furnished in a hospital emergency room after the 
sudden onset of a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms 
of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that the absence of 
immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in--
    (A) Placing the patient's health in serious jeopardy;
    (B) Serious impairment to bodily functions; or
    (C) Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.
    (iv) Anesthesiology services and diagnostic and therapeutic 
radiology services.
    (v) Federally qualified health center services paid under the rules 
in part 405 subpart X.
    (5) Methodology for developing limits--(i) Development of a charge 
base. The carrier establishes a charge base for each service identified 
as a routine office-based physician service. The

[[Page 58]]

charge base consists of the prevailing charge in the locality for each 
such service adjusted by the economic index. The carrier uses the 
prevailing charges that apply to services by nonspecialists in office 
practices in the locality in which the outpatient setting is located.
    (ii) Calculation of the outpatient limits. The carrier calculates 
the charge limit for each service by multiplying the charge base amount 
for each service by .60.
    (6) Application of limits. The reasonable charge for physician 
services of the type described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section that 
are furnished in an outpatient setting is the lowest of the actual 
charges, the customary charges in accordance with Sec. 405.503, the 
prevailing charges applicable to these services in accordance with 
Sec. 405.504, or the charge limits calculated in paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of 
this section.
    (g) Determination of reasonable charges in special circumstances: 
General. HCFA or a carrier may establish special reasonable charge 
limits for a category of service if it determines that the standard 
rules for calculating reasonable charges set forth in this subpart 
result in grossly deficient or excessive charges. The limit on the 
reasonable charge is an upper limit to correct a grossly excessive 
charge or a lower limit to correct a grossly deficient charge. The limit 
is either a specific dollar amount, or is based on a special method to 
be used in determining the reasonable charge.
    (1) Determination of excessive or deficient charges. HCFA or a 
carrier may make a determination that the standard rules for calculating 
reasonable charges set forth in this subpart result in grossly deficient 
or excessive charges. HCFA's determination may apply to the services of 
any supplier; however, a carrier's determination may apply only to 
nonphysician services. Examples of the circumstances which may result in 
grossly deficient or excessive charges include, but are not limited to 
the following:
    (i) The marketplace is not competitive. This includes circumstances 
in which the marketplace for a service is not truly competitive because 
a limited number of physicians perform the service.
    (ii) Medicare and Medicaid are the sole or primary sources of 
payment for a service.
    (iii) The charges involve the use of new technology for which an 
extensive charge history does not exist.
    (iv) The charges do not reflect changing technology, increased 
facility with that technology, or changes in acquisition, production or 
supplier costs.
    (v) The prevailing charges for a service in a particular locality 
are significantly in excess of or below prevailing charges in other 
comparable localities, taking into account the relative costs of 
furnishing the services in the different localities.
    (vi) Charges are grossly lower than or in excess of acquisition or 
production costs.
    (vii) There have been increases in charges for a service that cannot 
be explained by inflation or technology.
    (viii) The prevailing charges for a service are substantially higher 
or lower than the payments made for the service by other purchasers in 
the same locality.
    (2) Establishing a limit. In establishing a limit, HCFA or a carrier 
considers the available information that is relevant to the category of 
service and establishes a reasonable charge that is realistic and 
equitable. The factors to be considered in establishing a specific 
dollar amount or special method may include the following:
    (i) Price markup. This is the relationship between the retail and 
wholesale prices or manufacturer's costs of a category of service. If 
information on a particular category of service is not available, HCFA 
or a carrier may consider the markup on similar services and information 
on general industry pricing trends.
    (ii) Differences in charges. HCFA or a carrier may consider the 
differences in charges to non-Medicare and Medicare patients or to 
institutions and other large volume purchasers.
    (iii) Costs. HCFA or a carrier may consider resources (overhead, 
time, acquisition costs, production costs, complexity, etc.) required to 
produce a service or a product.

[[Page 59]]

    (iv) Utilization. HCFA or a carrier may impute a reasonable rate of 
use for a category of service and consider unit costs based on efficient 
utilization.
    (v) Charges in other localities.
    (vi) Other relevant factors.
    (3) Notification of limits--(i) National limits. When HCFA makes a 
determination regarding nonphysicians' services under this section, it 
publishes in the Federal Register proposed and final notices of a 
special reasonable charge limit before the limit is adopted. The notice 
sets forth in the Federal Register the criteria and circumstances, if 
any, under which a carrier may grant an exception to the limit.
    (ii) Carrier level limits. After September 9, 1988, a carrier 
proposing to establish a generally applicable special reasonable charge 
limit must inform the affected suppliers and State Medicaid agencies of 
the factors considered in establishing the limit as described in 
paragraphs (g) (1) and (2) of this section and solicit comments. After 
evaluating the comments received, the carrier must inform the affected 
suppliers and State Medicaid agencies of any final limit established. 
The limit is effective for services furnished no fewer than 30 days 
after the date of the carrier's notification.
    (h) Determination of reasonable charges in special circumstances: 
Physician services. In establishing special reasonable charge limits for 
a category of physician services, HCFA applies the general rules under 
paragraphs (g) (1) and (2) of this section and the following special 
rules:
    (1) Potential impact of special limit. In determining whether to set 
a special reasonable charge limit for a category of physician service, 
HCFA considers the potential impact on quality, access, beneficiary 
liability, assignment rates, reasonable charge reductions on unassigned 
claims, and participation rates of physicians.
    (2) Physician consultation. Before making a determination that a 
charge is not inherently reasonable by reason of its grossly excessive 
or deficient amount, HCFA consults with representatives of the 
physicians likely to be affected by any change in the reasonable charge.
    (3) Special limits based on comparison of charges in different 
localities. HCFA takes into account differences in practice costs before 
basing a special limit on the comparison of prevailing charges in 
different localities.
    (4) Factors considered in establishing a special limit. (i) In 
establishing the specific dollar amount or special method under 
paragraph (g)(2) of this section, HCFA takes into account regional 
differences in fees unless there is substantial economic justification, 
as described in the proposed and final notices required under paragraphs 
(h)(5) (i) and (ii) of this section, for a uniform fee or a uniform 
payment limit.
    (ii) In determining that a charge is not inherently reasonable by 
reason of its grossly excessive or deficient amount, and in establishing 
the specific dollar amount or special method under paragraphs (g) (1) 
and (2) of this section, HCFA may compare the charge to the--
    (A) Resource costs (that is, factors such as the time required to 
provide a procedure, including pre-procedure evaluation and post-
procedure follow-up; the complexity of the procedure; the training 
required to perform the procedure; and the risk involved in the 
procedure) for related services;
    (B) Resource costs for the service over a period of time;
    (C) Charges for the service in different geographic areas after 
accounting for differences in practice costs;
    (D) Payments for a service allowed under Medicare Part B and by 
other payors; and
    (E) Other relevant factors.
    (5) Publication of national limits. When HCFA makes a determination 
under this section, it publishes in the Federal Register proposed and 
final notices of a special reasonable charge limit before the limit is 
adopted. The notice sets forth in the Federal Register the criteria and 
circumstances, if any, under which a carrier may grant an exception to 
the limit.
    (i) Proposed notice. The proposed notice--
    (A) Specifies the proposed charge or methodology to be established 
with respect to a service;

[[Page 60]]

    (B) Explains the factors and data that HCFA took into account in 
determining the charge or methodology, including the economic 
justification for a uniform fee or payment limit if it is proposed;
    (C) Explains the potential impacts of a limit on physicians' 
services as described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section; and
    (D) Allows no less than 60 days for public comment on the proposal.
    (ii) Final notice. The final notice--
    (A) Explains the factors and data that HCFA took into consideration, 
including the economic justification for any uniform fee or payment 
limit established; and
    (B) Responds to the public comments and any comments made by the 
Physician Payment Review Commission.

<R05>
Sec. 405.503  Determining customary charges.

    (a) Customary charge defined. The term ``customary charges'' will 
refer to the uniform amount which the individual physician or other 
person charges in the majority of cases for a specific medical procedure 
or service. In determining such uniform amount, token charges for 
charity patients and substandard charges for welfare and other low 
income patients are to be excluded. The reasonable charge cannot, except 
as provided in Sec. 405.506, be higher than the individual physician's 
or other person's customary charge. The customary charge for different 
physicians or other persons may, of course, vary. Payment for covered 
services would be based on the actual charge for the service when, in a 
given instance, that charge is less than the amount which the carrier 
would otherwise have found to be within the limits of acceptable charges 
for the particular service. Moreover, the income of the individual 
beneficiary is not to be taken into account by the carrier in 
determining the amount which is considered to be a reasonable charge for 
a service rendered to him. There is no provision in the law for a 
carrier to evaluate the reasonableness of charges in light of an 
individual beneficiary's economic status.
    (b) Variation of charges. If the individual physician or other 
person varies his charges for a specific medical procedure or service, 
so that no one amount is charged in the majority of cases, it will be 
necessary for the carrier to exercise judgment in the establishment of a 
``customary charge'' for such physician or other person. In making this 
judgment, an important guide, to be utilized when a sufficient volume of 
data on the physician's or other person's charges is available, would be 
the median or midpoint of his charges, excluding token and substandard 
charges as well as exceptional charges on the high side. A significant 
clustering of charges in the vicinity of the median amount might 
indicate that a point of such clustering should be taken as the 
physician's or other person's ``customary'' charge. Use of relative 
value scales will help in arriving at a decision in such instances.
    (c) Use of relative value scales. If, for a particular medical 
procedure or service, the carrier is unable to determine the customary 
charge on the basis of reliable statistical data (for example, because 
the carrier does not yet have sufficient data or because the performance 
of the particular medical procedure or service by the physician or other 
person is infrequent), the carrier may use appropriate relative value 
scales to determine the customary charge for such procedure or service 
in relation to customary charges of the same physician or person for 
other medical procedures and services.
    (d) Revision of customary charge. A physician's or other person's 
customary charge is not necessarily a static amount. Where a physician 
or other person alters his charges, a revised pattern of charges for his 
services may develop. Where on the basis of adequate evidence, the 
carrier finds that the physician or other person furnishing services has 
changed his charge for a service to the public in general, the customary 
charge resulting from

[[Page 61]]

the revised charge for the service should be recognized as the customary 
charge in making determinations of reasonable charges for such service 
when rendered thereafter to supplementary insurance beneficiaries. If 
the new customary charge is not above the top of the range of prevailing 
charges (see Sec. 405.504(a)), it should be deemed to be reasonable by 
the carrier, subject to the provisions of Sec. 405.508.


<R05>
Sec. 405.504  Determining prevailing charges.

    (a) Ranges of charges. (1) In the case of physicians' services 
furnished beginning January 1, 1987, the prevailing charges for a 
nonparticipating physician as defined in this paragraph will be no 
higher than the same level that was set for services furnished during 
the previous calendar year for a physician who was a participating 
physician during that year. A nonparticipating physician is a physician 
who has not entered into an agreement with the Medicare program to 
accept payment on an assignment-related basis (in accordance with 
Sec. 424.55 of this chapter) for all items and services furnished to 
individuals enrolled under Part B of Medicare during a given calendar 
year.
    (2) No charge for Part B medical or other health services may be 
considered to be reasonable if it exceeds the higher of:
    (i) The prevailing charge for similar services in the same locality 
in effect on December 31, 1970, provided such prevailing charge had been 
found acceptable by HCFA; or
    (ii) The prevailing charge that, on the basis of statistical data 
and methodology acceptable to HCFA, would cover:
    (A) 75 percent of the customary charges made for similar services in 
the same locality during the 12-month period of July 1 through June 30 
preceding the fee screen year (January 1 through December 31) in which 
the service was furnished; or
    (B) In the case of services furnished more than 12 months before the 
beginning of the fee screen year (January 1 through December 31) in 
which the claim or request for payment is submitted, 75 percent of the 
customary charges made for similar services in the same locality during 
the 12 month period of July 1 through June 30 preceding the fee screen 
year that ends immediately preceding the fee screen year in which the 
claim or request for payment is submitted.
    (3)(i) In the case of physicians' services, furnished before January 
1, 1992, each prevailing charge in each locality may not exceed the 
prevailing charge determined for the FY ending June 30, 1973 (without 
reference to the adjustments made in accordance with the economic 
stabilization program then in effect), except on the basis of 
appropriate economic index data that demonstrate the higher prevailing 
charge level is justified by:
    (A) Changes in general earnings levels of workers that are 
attributable to factors other than increases in their productivity; and
    (B) changes in expenses of the kind incurred by physicians in office 
practice. The office-expense component and the earnings component of 
such index shall be given the relative weights shown in data on self-
employed physicians' gross incomes.

    Example. The available data indicate the office-expense and earnings 
components of the index should be given relative weights of 40 percent 
and 60 percent, respectively, and it is calculated that the aggregate 
increase in expenses of practice for a particular July through June 
period was 112 percent over the expenses of practice for calendar year 
1971 and the increase in earnings (less increases in workers' 
productivity was 110 percent over the earnings for calendar year 1971. 
The allowable increase in any prevailing charge that could be recognized 
during the next fee screen year would be 110.8 percent 
((.40 x 112)+(.60) x 110)=110.8) above the prevailing charge recognized 
for fiscal year 1973.

    (ii)(A) If the increase in the prevailing charge in a locality for a 
particular physician service resulting from an aggregate increase in 
customary charges for that service does not exceed the index determined 
under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, the increase is permitted and 
any portion of the allowable increase not used is carried forward and is 
a basis for justifying increases in that prevailing charge in the 
future. However, if the increase in the prevailing charge exceeds the 
allowable increase, the increase will be reduced

[[Page 62]]

to the allowable amount. Further increases will be justified only to the 
degree that they do not exceed further rises in the economic index. The 
prevailing charge for physicians' services furnished during the 15-month 
period beginning July 1, 1984 may not exceed the prevailing charge for 
physicians' services in effect for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 
1983. The increase in prevailing charges for physicians' services for 
subsequent fee screen years similarly may not reflect the rise in the 
economic index that would have otherwise been provided for the period 
beginning July 1, 1984, and must be treated as having fully provided for 
the rise in the economic index which would have been otherwise taken 
into account.
    (B) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and 
(ii)(A) of this section, the prevailing charge in the case of a 
physician service in a particular locality determined pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2) and (3)(i) of this section for the fiscal year 
beginning July 1, 1975, and for any subsequent fee screen years, if 
lower than the prevailing charge for the fiscal year ending June 30, 
1975, by reason of the application of economic index data, must be 
raised to such prevailing charge which was in effect for the fiscal year 
ending June 30, 1975. (If the amount paid on any claim processed by a 
carrier after the original reasonable charge update for the fiscal year 
beginning July 1, 1975, and prior to the adjustments required by the 
preceding sentence, was at least $1 less than the amount due pursuant to 
the preceding sentence, the difference between the amount previously 
paid and the amount due shall be paid within 6 months after December 31, 
1975; however, no payment shall be made on any claim where the 
difference between the amount previously and the amount due shall be 
paid within 6 months after December 31, 1975; however, no payment shall 
be made on any claim where the difference between the amount previously 
paid and the amount due is less than $1.)
    (iii) If, for any reason, a prevailing charge for a service in a 
locality has no precise counterpart in the carrier's charge data for 
calendar year 1971 (the data on which the prevailing charge calculations 
for fiscal year 1973 were based), the limit on the prevailing charge 
will be estimated, on the basis of data and methodology acceptable to 
HCFA, to seek to produce the effect intended by the economic index 
criterion. The allowance or reduction of an increase in a prevailing 
charge for any individual medical item or service may affect the 
allowance or reduction of an increase in the prevailing charges for 
other items or services if, for example, the limit on the prevailing 
charge is estimated, or if the prevailing charges for more than one item 
or service are established through the use of a relative value schedule 
and dollar conversion factors.
    (b) Variation in range of prevailing charges. The range of 
prevailing charges in a locality may be different for physicians or 
other persons who engage in a specialty practice or service than for 
others. Existing differentials in the level of charges between different 
kinds of practice or service could, in some localities, lead to the 
development of more than one range of prevailing charges for application 
by the carrier in its determinations of reasonable charges. Carrier 
decisions in this respect should be responsive to the existing patterns 
of charges by physicians and other persons who render covered services, 
and should establish differentials in the levels of charges between 
different kinds of practice or service only where in accord with such 
patterns.
    (c) Re-evaluation and adjustment of prevailing charges. 
Determinations of prevailing charges by the carrier are to be re-
evaluated and adjusted from time to time on the basis of factual 
information about the charges made by physicians and other persons to 
the public in general. This information should be obtained from all 
possible sources including a carrier's experience with its own programs 
as well as with the supplementary medical insurance program.
    (d) Computation and issuance of the MEI after CY 1992--(1) For 
update years after CY 1992, the MEI is a physician input price index, in 
which the annual percent changes for the direct-labor price components 
are adjusted by an annual percent change in a 10-year

[[Page 63]]

moving average index of labor productivity in the nonfarm business 
sector.
    (2) The MEI is constructed, using as a base year, CY 1989 weights 
and annual percent changes in the economic price proxies as shown on the 
following chart:

   Medicare Economic Index Expenditure Categories, Weights, and Price   
                                 Proxies

Sec. 405.505  Determination of locality.

    ``Locality'' is the geographical area for which the carrier is to 
derive the reasonable charges or fee schedule amounts for services or 
items. Usually, a locality may be a State (including the District of 
Columbia, a territory, or a Commonwealth), a political or economic 
subdivision of a State, or a group of States. It should include a cross 
section of the population with respect to economic and other 
characteristics. Where people tend to gravitate toward certain 
population centers to obtain medical care or service, localities may be 
recognized on a basis constituting medical services areas (interstate or 
otherwise), comparable in concept to ``trade areas.'' Localities may 
differ in population density, economic level, and other major factors 
affecting charges for services. Carriers therefore shall delineate 
localities on the basis of their knowledge of local conditions. However, 
distinctions between localities are not to be so finely made that a 
locality includes only a very limited geographic area whose population 
has

[[Page 64]]

distinctly similar income characteristics (e.g., a very rich or very 
poor neighborhood within a city).

Sec. 405.506  Charges higher than customary or prevailing charges or lowest charge levels.

    A charge which exceeds the customary charge of the physician or 
other person who rendered the medical or other health service, or the 
prevailing charge in the locality, or an applicable lowest charge level 
may be found to be reasonable, but only where there are unusual 
circumstances, or medical complications requiring additional time, 
effort or expense which support an additional charge, and only if it is 
acceptable medical or medical service practice in the locality to make 
an extra charge in such cases. The mere fact that the physician's or 
other person's customary charge is higher than prevailing would not 
justify a determination that it is reasonable.

Sec. 405.507  Illustrations of the application of the criteria for determining reasonable charges.

    The following examples illustrate how the general criteria on 
customary charges and prevailing charges might be applied in determining 
reasonable charges under the supplementary medical insurance program. 
Basically, these examples demonstrate that, except where the actual 
charge is less, reasonable charges will reflect current customary 
charges of the particular physician or other person within the ranges of 
the current prevailing charges in the locality for that type and level 
of service:

    The prevailing charge for a specific medical procedure ranges from 
$80 to $100 in a certain locality.
    Doctor A's bill is for $75 although he customarily charges $80 for 
the procedure.
    Doctor B's bill is his customary charge of $85
    Doctor C's bill is his customary charge of $125
    Doctor D's bill is for $100, although he customarily charges $80, 
and there are no special circumstances in the case.
    The reasonable charge for Doctor A would be limited to $75 since 
under the law the reasonable charge cannot exceed the actual charge, 
even if it is lower than his customary charge and below the prevailing 
charges for the locality.
    The reasonable charge for Doctor B would be $85, because it is his 
customary charge and it falls within the range of prevailing charges for 
that locality.
    The reasonable charge for Doctor C could not be more than $100, the 
top of the range of prevailing charges.
    The reasonable charge for Doctor D would be $80, because that is his 
customary charge. Even though his actual charge of $100 falls within the 
range of prevailing charges, the reasonable charge cannot exceed his 
customary charge in the absence of special circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 405.508  Determination of comparable circumstances; limitation.

    (a) Application of limitation. The carrier may not in any case make 
a determination of reasonable charge which would be higher than the 
charge upon which it would base payment to its own policyholders for a 
comparable service in comparable circumstances. The charge upon which it 
would base payment, however, does not necessarily mean the amount the 
carrier would be obligated to pay. Under certain circumstances, some 
carriers pay amounts on behalf of individuals who are their 
policyholders, which are below the customary charges of physicians or 
other persons to other individuals. Payment under the supplementary 
medical insurance program would not be limited to these lower amounts.
    (b) When comparability exists. ``Comparable circumstances,'' as used 
in the Act and this subpart, refers to the circumstances under which 
services are rendered to individuals and the nature of the carrier's 
health insurance programs and the method it uses to determine the 
amounts of payments under these programs. Generally, comparability would 
exist where:
    (1) The carrier bases payment under its program on the customary 
charges, as presently constituted, of physicians or other persons and on 
current prevailing charges in a locality, and

[[Page 65]]

    (2) The determination does not preclude recognition of factors such 
as speciality status and unusual circumstances which affect the amount 
charged for a service.
    (c) Responsibility for determining comparability. Responsibility for 
determining whether or not a carrier's program has comparability will in 
the first instance fall upon the carrier in reporting pertinent 
information about its programs to the Health Care Financing 
Administration. When the pertinent information has been reported, the 
Health Care Financing Administration will advise the carrier whether any 
of its programs have comparability.


<R05>
Sec. 405.509  Determining the inflation-indexed charge.

    (a) Definition. For purposes of this section, inflation-indexed 
charge means the lowest of the fee screens used to determine reasonable 
charges (as determined in Sec. 405.503 for the customary charge, 
Sec. 405.504 for the prevailing charge, this section for the inflation-
indexed charge, and Sec. 405.511 for the lowest charge level) for 
services, supplies, and equipment reimbursed on a reasonable charge 
basis (excluding physicians' services), that is in effect on December 31 
of the previous fee screen year, updated by the inflation adjustment 
factor, as described in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Application of inflation adjustment factor to determine 
inflation-indexed charge. (1) For fee screen years beginning on or after 
January 1, 1987, the inflation-indexed charge is determined by updating 
the fee screen used to determine the reasonable charges in effect on 
December 31 of the previous fee screen year by application of an 
inflation adjustment factor, that is, the annual change in the level of 
the consumer price index for all urban consumers, as compiled by the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, for the 12-month period ending on June 30 of 
each year.
    (2) For services, supplies, and equipment furnished from October 1, 
1985 through December 31, 1986 the inflation adjustment factor is zero.
    (c) The inflation-indexed charge does not apply to any services, 
supplies, or equipment furnished after December 31, 1991, that are 
covered under or limited by the fee schedule for physicians' services 
established under section 1848 of the Act and part 415 of this chapter. 
These services are subject to the Medicare Economic Index described in 
Sec. 415.30 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 405.511  Reasonable charges for medical services, supplies, and equipment.

    (a) General rule. (1) A charge for any medical service, supply, or 
equipment (including equipment servicing) that in the judgment of HCFA 
generally does not vary significantly in quality from one supplier to 
another (and that is identified by a notice published in the Federal 
Register) may not be considered reasonable if it exceeds:
    (i) The customary charge of the supplier (see Sec. 405.503);
    (ii) The prevailing charge in the locality (see Sec. 405.504);
    (iii) The charge applicable for a comparable service and under 
comparable circumstances to the policyholders or subscribers of the 
carrier (see Sec. 405.508);
    (iv) The lowest charge level at which the item or service is widely 
and consistently available in the locality (see paragraph (c) of this 
section); or
    (v) The inflation-indexed charge, as determined under Sec. 405.509, 
in the case of medical services, supplies, and equipment that are 
reimbursed on a reasonable charge basis (excluding physicians' 
services).
    (2) In the case of laboratory services, paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section is applicable to services furnished by physicians in their 
offices, by independent laboratories (see Sec. 405.1310(a)) and to 
services furnished by a hospital laboratory for individuals who are 
neither inpatients nor outpatients of a hospital. Allowance of 
additional charges exceeding the lowest charge level can be approved by 
the carrier on the basis of unusual circumstances or medical 
complications in accordance with Sec. 405.506.
    (b) Public notice of items and services subject to the lowest charge 
level rule. Before the Secretary determines that lowest charge levels 
should be established for an item or service, notice of the proposed 
determination will be

[[Page 66]]

published with an opportunity for public comment. The descriptions or 
specifications of items or services in the notice will be in sufficient 
detail to permit a determination that items or services conforming to 
the descriptions will not vary significantly in quality.
    (c) Calculating the lowest charge level. The lowest charge level at 
which an item or service is widely and consistently available in a 
locality is calculated by the carrier in accordance with instructions 
from HCFA as follows:
    (1) For items or services furnished on or before December 31, 1986.
    (i) A lowest charge level is calculated for each identified item or 
service in January and July of each year.
    (ii) The lowest charge level for each identified item or service is 
set at the 25th percentile of the charges (incurred or submitted on 
claims processed by the carrier) for that item or service, in the 
locality designated by the carrier for this purpose, during the second 
calendar quarter preceding the determination date. Accordingly, the 
January calculations will be based on charges for the July through 
September quarter of the previous calendar year, and the July 
calculations will be based on charges for the January through March 
quarter of the same calendar year.
    (2) For items or services furnished on or after January 1, 1987.
    (i) A lowest charge level is calculated for each identified item or 
service in January of each year.
    (ii) The lowest charge level for each identified item or service is 
set at the 25th percentile of the charges (incurred or submitted on 
claims processed by the carrier) for that item or service, in the 
locality designated by the carrier for this purpose, during the 3-month 
period of July 1 through September 30 preceding the fee screen year 
(January 1 through December 31) for which the item or service was 
furnished.
    (3) Lowest charge levels for laboratory services. In setting lowest 
charge levels for laboratory services, the carrier will consider only 
charges made for laboratory services performed by physicians in their 
offices, by independent laboratories which meet coverage requirements, 
and for services furnished by a hospital laboratory for individuals who 
are neither inpatients nor outpatients of a hospital.
    (d) Locality. Subject to the approval of the Secretary, the carrier 
may designate its entire service area as the locality for purposes of 
this section, or may otherwise modify the localities used for 
calculating prevailing charges. (The modified locality for an item or 
service will also be used for calculating the prevailing charge for that 
item or service.)

Sec. 405.512  Carriers' procedural terminology and coding systems.

    (a) General. Procedural terminology and coding systems are designed 
to provide physicians and third party payers with a common language that 
accurately describes the kinds and levels of services provided and that 
can serve as a basis for coverage and payment determinations.
    (b) Modification of terminology and/or coding systems. A carrier 
that wishes to modify its system of procedural terminology and coding 
shall submit its request to the Health Care Financing Administration 
with all pertinent data and information for approval before the revision 
is implemented. The Health Care Financing Administration will evaluate 
the proposal in the light of the guidelines specified in paragraph (c) 
of this section and such other considerations as may be pertinent, and 
consult with the Assistant Secretary for Health. The Health Care 
Financing Administration will approve such a revision if it determines 
that the potential advantages of the proposed new system, outweigh the 
disadvantages.
    (c) Guidelines. The following considerations and guidelines are 
taken into account in evaluating a carrier's proposal to change its 
system of procedural terminology and coding:
    (1) The rationale for converting to the new terminology and coding;
    (2) The estimated short-run and long-run impact on the cost of the 
health insurance program, other medical care

[[Page 67]]

costs, administrative expenses, and the reliability of the estimates;
    (3) The degree to which the conversion to the proposed new 
terminology and coding can be accomplished in a way that permits full 
implementation of the reasonable charge criteria in accordance with the 
provisions of this subpart;
    (4) The degree to which the proposed new terminology and coding are 
accepted by physicians in the carrier's area (physician acceptance is 
assumed only if a majority of the Medicare and non-Medicare bills and 
claims completed by physicians in the area and submitted to the carrier 
can reasonably be expected to utilize the proposed new terminology and 
coding);
    (5) The extent to which the proposed new terminology and coding 
system is used by the carrier in its non-Medicare business;
    (6) The clarity with which the proposed system defines its 
terminology and whether the system lends itself to:
    (i) Accurate determinations of coverage;
    (ii) Proper assessment of the appropriate level of payment; and
    (iii) Meeting the carrier's or Professional Standards Review 
Organizations' review needs and such other review needs as may be 
appropriate;
    (7) Compatibility of the new terminology and coding system with 
other systems that the carrier and other carriers may utilize in the 
administration of the Medicare program--e.g., its compatibility with 
systems and statistical requirements and with the historical data in the 
carrier's processing system; and
    (8) Compatibility of the proposed system with the carriers methods 
for determining payment under the fee schedule for physicians' services 
for services which are identified by a single element of terminology but 
which may vary in content.

Sec. 405.515  Reimbursement for clinical laboratory services billed by physicians.

    This section implements section 1842(h) of the Social Security Act, 
which places a limitation on reimbursement for markups on clinical 
laboratory services billed by physicians. If a physician's bill, or a 
request for payment for a physician's services, includes a charge for a 
laboratory test for which payment may be made under this part, the 
amount payable with respect to the test shall be determined as follows 
(subject to the coinsurance and deductible provisions at Secs. 410.152 
and 410.160 of this chapter):
    (a) If the bill or request for payment indicates that the test was 
personally performed or supervised either by the physician who submitted 
the bill (or for whose services the request for payment was made), or by 
another physician with whom that physician shares his or her practice, 
the payment will be based on the physician's reasonable charge for the 
test (as determined in accordance with Sec. 405.502).
    (b) If the bill or request for payment indicates that the test was 
performed by an outside laboratory, and identifies both the laboratory 
and the amount the laboratory charged, payment for the test will be 
based on the lower of--
    (1) The laboratory's reasonable charge for the service (as 
determined in accordance with Sec. 405.502), or
    (2) The amount that the laboratory charged the physician for the 
service.
    (c) If the bill or request for payment does not indicate that the 
conditions specified in paragraph (a) of this section were met, and does 
not identify both the laboratory and the amount the laboratory charged, 
payment will be based on the lowest charge at which the carrier 
estimates the test could have been secured from a laboratory serving the 
physician's locality. The carrier will estimate this lowest amount twice 
a year by (i) obtaining lists of charges laboratories make to physicians 
from as many commercial laboratories serving the carrier's area as 
possible (including laboratories in other States from which tests may be 
obtained by physicians in the carrier's service area) and (ii) 
establishing a schedule of lowest prices based on this information. The 
carrier will take into consideration specific circumstances, such as a 
need for emergency services

[[Page 68]]

that may be costlier than routine services, in making the estimate in a 
particular case. However, in no case may this estimate be higher than 
the lowest customary charge for commercial laboratories, or when 
applicable to the laboratory service, the lowest charge level determined 
in accordance with Sec. 405.511, in the carrier's service area.
    (d) When a physician bills, in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) 
of this section, for a laboratory test and indicates that it was 
performed by an independent laboratory, a nominal payment will also be 
made to the physician for collecting, handling, and shipping the 
specimen to the laboratory, if the physician bills for such a service.

Sec. 405.517  Payment for drugs that are not paid on a cost or prospective payment basis.

    (a) Applicability. Payment for a drug that is not paid on a cost or 
prospective payment basis is determined by the standard methodology 
described in paragraph (b) of this section. Examples of when this 
procedure applies includes a drug furnished incident to a physician's 
service and a drug furnished by an independent dialysis facility that is 
not included in the ESRD composite rate set forth in Sec. 413.170(c) of 
this chapter.
    (b) Methodology. Payment for a drug described in paragraph (a) of 
this section is based on the lower of the estimated acquisition cost or 
the national average wholesale price of the drug. The estimated 
acquisition cost is determined based on surveys of the actual invoice 
prices paid for the drug. In calculating the estimated acquisition cost 
of a drug, the carrier may consider factors such as inventory, waste, 
and spoilage.
    (c) Multiple-Source drugs. For multiple-source drugs, payment is 
based on the lower of the estimated acquisition cost described in 
paragraph (b) of this section or the wholesale price that, for this 
purpose, is defined as the median price for all sources of the generic 
form of the drug.

Sec. 405.534  Limitation on payment for screening mammography services.

    (a) Basis and scope. This section implements section 1834(c) of the 
Act by establishing a limit on payment for screening mammography 
examinations. There are three categories of billing for screening 
mammography services. Those categories and the payment limitations on 
each are set forth in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.
    (b) Global or complete service billing representing both the 
professional and technical components of the procedure. If a fee is 
billed for a global service, the amount of payment subject to the 
deductible is equal to 80 percent of the least of the following:
    (1) The actual charge for the service.
    (2) The amount established for the global procedure for a diagnostic 
bilateral mammogram under the fee schedule for physicians' services set 
forth at part 414, subpart A.
    (3) The payment limit for the procedure. For screening mammography 
services furnished in CY 1994, the payment limit is $59.63. On January 1 
of each subsequent year, the payment limit is updated by the percentage 
increase in the Medicare Economic Index (MEI) and reflects the 
relationship between the relative value units for the professional and 
technical components of a diagnostic bilateral mammogram under the fee 
schedule for physicians' services.
    (c) Professional component billing representing only the physician's 
interpretation for the procedure. If the professional component of 
screening mammography services is billed separately, the amount of 
payment for that professional component, subject to the deductible, is 
equal to 80 percent of the least of the following:
    (1) The actual charge for the professional component of the service.
    (2) The amount established for the professional component of a 
diagnostic bilateral mammogram under the fee schedule for physicians' 
services.
    (3) The professional component of the payment limit for screening 
mammography services described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

[[Page 69]]

    (d) Technical component billing representing other resources 
involved in furnishing the procedure. If the technical component of 
screening mammography services is billed separately, the amount of 
payment, subject to the deductible, is equal to 80 percent of the least 
of the following:
    (1) The actual charge for the technical component of the service.
    (2) The amount established for the technical component of a 
diagnostic bilateral mammogram under the fee schedule for physicians' 
services.
    (3) The technical component of the payment limit for screening 
mammography services described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

and services furnished are covered under part A of title XVIII, and 
where appropriate, ascertained and made payment of amounts due or has 
ascertained that no payments were due, the individual will be notified 
in writing of the initial determination in his case. In addition, if the 
items or services furnished such individual are not covered under part A 
of title XVIII by reason of Sec. 411.15(g) or Sec. 411.15(k) and payment 
may not be made for such items or services under Sec. 411.400 only 
because the requirements of Sec. 411.400(a)(2) are not met, the provider 
of services which furnished such items or services will be notified in 
writing of the initial determination in such individual's case. These 
notices shall be mailed to the individual and the provider of services 
at their last known addresses and shall state in detail the basis for 
the determination. Such written notices shall also inform the individual 
and the provider of services of their right to reconsideration of the 
determination if they are dissatisfied with the determination.

Sec. 405.704(c)) that such individual did not know or could not

law judge (ALJ) hearing or Departmental Appeals Board (DAB) review if 
the following conditions are met:
    (1) HCFA has made a reconsideration determination; an ALJ has made a 
hearing decision; or DAB review has been requested, but a final decision 
has not been issued.
    (2) The filing entity is a party referred to in Sec. 405.718(d).
    (3) The party has filed a request for an ALJ hearing in accordance 
with Sec. 405.722, or DAB review in accordance with 20 CFR 404.968.

    (5) If there is more than one party to the reconsideration 
determination or hearing decision, each party concurs, in writing, with 
the request for the EAP.

[[Page 74]]

    (b) Content of the request for EAP. The request for the EAP:
    (1) Alleges that there are no material issues of fact in dispute; 
and
    (2) Asserts that the only factor precluding a decision favorable to 
the party is a statutory provision that is unconstitutional or a 
regulation, national coverage decision under section 1862(a)(1) of the 
Act, or HCFA Ruling that is invalid.
    (c) Place and time for requesting an EAP.--(1) Place for filing 
request. The person must file a written request--
    (i) At an office of SSA or HCFA; or
    (ii) If the person is in the Philippines, at the Veterans 
Administration Regional Office or with an ALJ; or
    (iii) If the person is a qualified railroad retirement beneficiary,

receipt of the notice of the ALJ's decision;
    (ii) Within 60 days after the date of receipt of notice of the ALJ's 
decision or dismissal, unless the time is extended in accordance with 
the standards set out in 20 CFR 404.925(c). For purposes of this 
section, the date of receipt of the notice is presumed to be 5 days 
after the date on the notice, unless it is shown that the notice was 
received later; or
    (iii) If the party has requested DAB review, at any time prior to 
receipt of notice of the Board's decision.
    (d) Parties to the EAP. The parties to the EAP are the persons who 
were parties to the reconsideration determination and, if appropriate, 
to the hearing.
    (e) Determination on request for EAP. (1) For EAP requests initiated 
at the ALJ level, an ALJ determines whether all conditions of paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section are met.
    (2) If a hearing decision has been issued, the DAB determines 
whether all conditions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are 
met.
    (f) ALJ or DAB certification for the EAP. If the party meets the 
requirements for the EAP, the ALJ or the DAB, as appropriate, certifies 
the case in writing stating that:
    (1) The facts involved in the claim are not in dispute;
    (2) Except as indicated in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, HCFA's 
interpretation of the law is not in dispute;
    (3) The sole issue(s) in dispute is the constitutionality of a 
statutory provision or the validity of a regulation, HCFA Ruling, or 
national coverage decision based on section 1862(a)(1) of the Act.
    (4) Except for the provision challenged, the right(s) of the party 
is established; and

of the certification described in paragraph (f) of this section, the 
party waives completion of the remaining steps of the administrative 
appeals process.
    (2) The 60-day period for filing a civil suit in a Federal district 
court begins on the date of receipt of the ALJ or DAB certification.
    (h) Effect of a request for EAP that does not result in 
certification. If a request for the EAP does not meet all the conditions 
for use of the process, the ALJ or DAB so advises the party and treats 
the request as a request for hearing or DAB review, as appropriate.

Sec. 405.732  Review of national coverage decisions (NCDs).

    (a) General. (1) HCFA makes NCDs either granting, limiting, or 
excluding Medicare coverage for a specific medical service, procedure or 
device. NCDs are made under section 1862(a)(1) of the Act or other 
applicable provisions of the Act. An NCD is binding on all Medicare 
carriers, fiscal intermediaries, PROs, HMOs, CMPs, and HCPPs when 
published in HCFA program manuals or the Federal Register.
    (2) Under section 1869(b)(3) of the Act, only NCDs made under 
section 1862(a)(1) of the Act are subject to the conditions of 
paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.
    (b) Review by ALJ. (1) An ALJ may not disregard, set aside, or 
otherwise review an NCD.
    (2) An ALJ may review the facts of a particular case to determine 
whether an NCD applies to a specific claim for benefits and, if so, 
whether the NCD has been applied correctly to the claim.
    (c) Review by Court. (1) A court's review of an NCD is limited to 
whether the record is incomplete or otherwise lacks adequate information 
to support the validity of the decision, unless the case has been 
remanded to the Secretary to supplement the record regarding the NCD. 
The court may not invalidate an NCD except upon review of the 
supplemented record.
    (2) A Federal court may not hold unlawful or set aside an NCD 
because it was not issued in accordance with the notice and comment 
procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or section 
1871(b) of the Act.
    (d) Remands--(1) Secretary's action. When a court remands an NCD 
matter to the Secretary because the record in support of the NCD is 
incomplete or otherwise lacks adequate information, the Secretary 
remands the case to HCFA in order to supplement the record.
    (2) Remand to HCFA. HCFA supplements the record with new or updated 
evidence, including additional information from other sources, and may 
issue a revised NCD.
    (3) Final Actions. (i) The proceedings to supplement the record are 
expedited.
    (ii) When HCFA does not issue a revised NCD, it returns the 
supplemented record to the court for review.
    (iii) When HCFA issues a revised NCD, it forwards the case to an ALJ 
who issues a new decision applying the revised NCD to the facts of the 
claim(s) under consideration. The ALJ's decision is subject to DAB 
review and, ultimately, judicial review.

Sec. 405.740  Principles for determining the amount in controversy.

    (a) Individual appellants. For the purpose of determining whether an 
individual appellant meets the minimum amount in controversy needed for 
a hearing ($100), the following rules apply:
    (1) The amount in controversy is computed as the actual amount 
charged the individual for the items and services in question, less any 
amount for which payment has been made by the intermediary and less any 
deductible and coinsurance amounts applicable in the particular case.
    (2) A single beneficiary may aggregate claims from two or more 
providers to meet the $100 hearing threshold and a single provider may 
aggregate claims for services provided to one or more beneficiaries to 
meet the $100 hearing threshold.
    (3) In either of the circumstances specified in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section, two or more claims may be aggregated by an individual 
appellant only if the claims have previously been reconsidered and a 
request for hearing has been made within 60 days after receipt of the 
reconsideration determination(s).
    (4) When requesting a hearing, the appellant must specify in his or 
her appeal request the specific claims to be aggregated.
    (b) Two or more appellants. As specified below, under section 
1869(b)(2) of the Act, two or more appellants may aggregate their claims 
together to meet the minimum amount in controversy needed for a hearing 
($100). The right to aggregate under this statutory provision applies to 
claims for items and services furnished on or after January 1, 1987.
    (1) The aggregate amount in controversy is computed as the actual 
amount charged the individual(s) for the items and services in question, 
less any amount for which payment has been made by the intermediary and 
less any deductible and coinsurance amounts applicable in the particular 
case.
    (2) In determining the amount in controversy, two or more appellants 
may aggregate their claims together under the following circumstances:
    (i) Two or more beneficiaries may combine claims representing 
services from the same or different provider(s) if the claims involve 
common issues of law and fact;
    (ii) Two or more providers may combine their claims if the claims 
involve the delivery of similar or related services to the same 
beneficiary; or
    (iii) Two or more providers may combine their claims if the claims 
involve common issues of law and fact with respect to services furnished 
to two or more beneficiaries.
    (iv) In any of the circumstances specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) 
through (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the claims may be aggregated only 
if the claims have previously been reconsidered and a request for 
hearing has been made within 60 days after receipt of the 
reconsideration determination(s). Moreover, in the request for hearing, 
the appellants must specify the claims that they seek to aggregate.
    (c) The determination as to whether the amount in controversy is 
$100 or more is made by the administrative law judge (ALJ).
    (d) In determining the amount in controversy under paragraph (b) of 
this section, the ALJ also makes the determination as to what 
constitutes ``similar or related services'' or ``common issues of law 
and fact.''

or two or more appellants, the Secretary may assert that the aggregation 
principles contained in this subpart may be applied to determine the 
amount in controversy for judicial review ($1000).

amount in controversy is computed as the amount that would have been 
charged the beneficiary for the items or services in question, less any 
deductible and coinsurance amounts applicable in the particular case, 
had such expenses not been paid pursuant to Sec. 411.400 of this chapter 
or had such liability not been limited pursuant to Sec. 411.402 of this 
chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 405.801  Part B appeals--general description.

    (a) The Medicare carrier makes an initial determination when a 
request for payment for Part B benefits is submitted. If an individual 
beneficiary is dissatisfied with the initial determination, he or she 
may request, and the carrier will perform, a review of the claim. 
Following the carrier's review determination, the beneficiary may obtain 
a carrier hearing if the amount remaining in controversy is at least 
$100. The beneficiary is also entitled to a carrier hearing without the 
benefit of a review determination when the initial request for payment 
is not being acted upon with reasonable promptness (as defined in 
Sec. 405.802). Following the carrier hearing, the beneficiary may obtain 
a hearing before an ALJ if the amount remaining in controversy is at 
least $500. If the beneficiary is dissatisfied with the decision of the 
ALJ, he or she may request the Departmental Appeals Board (DAB) to 
review the case. Following the action of the DAB, the beneficiary may 
file suit in Federal district court if the amount remaining in 
controversy is at least $1,000.
    (b) The rights of a beneficiary under paragraph (a) of this section 
to appeal the carrier's initial determination are granted also to--
    (1) A physician or supplier that furnishes services to a beneficiary 
and that accepts an assignment from the beneficiary, or
    (2) A physician who meets the conditions of section 1842(l)(1)(A) of 
the Act pertaining to refund requirements for nonparticipating 
physicians who have not taken assignment on the claim(s) at issue.
    (c) Procedures governing the determinations by SSA as to whether an 
individual has met basic Part B entitlement requirements are covered in 
subpart G of this part and 20 CFR part 404, subpart J. Subparts J and R 
of 20 CFR part 404 are also applicable to ALJ, DAB, and judicial review 
conducted under subpart H, except to the extent that specific provisions 
are contained in this subpart.

[62 FR 25853, May 12, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 405.802  Definitions.

    As used in subpart H of this part, the term--
    After receipt of the notice means 5 days after the date on the 
notice, unless it is shown that the notice was received earlier or 
later.
    Appellant designates the beneficiary, assignee or other person or 
entity that has filed an appeal concerning a particular determination of 
benefits under Medicare part B. Designation as an appellant does not in 
itself convey standing to appeal the determination in question.
    Assignee means a physician or supplier who furnishes services to a 
beneficiary under Medicare part B and who has accepted a valid 
assignment executed by the beneficiary.
    Assignment means the transfer by the assignor of his or her claim 
for payment to the assignee in return for the latter's promise not to 
charge more for his or her services than the carrier finds to be the 
reasonable charge or other approved amount.
    Assignor means a beneficiary under Medicare part B whose physician 
or supplier has taken assignment of a claim.
    Carrier means an organization which has entered into a contract with 
the Secretary pursuant to section 1842 of the Act and which is 
authorized to make determinations with respect to part B of title XVIII 
of the Act. For purposes of this subpart, the term carrier also refers 
to an intermediary that has entered into a contract with the Secretary 
under section 1816 of the Act and is authorized to make determinations 
with respect to part B provider services, as specified in Sec. 421.5(c) 
of this chapter.
    Common issues of law and fact, with respect to the aggregation of 
claims by two or more appellants to meet the minimum amount in 
controversy needed for an ALJ hearing, occurs when the

[[Page 79]]

claims sought to be aggregated are denied or reduced for similar reasons 
and arise from a similar fact pattern material to the reason the claims 
are denied.
    Delivery of similar or related services, with respect to the 
aggregation of claims by two or more physician/supplier appellants to 
meet the minimum amount in controversy needed for an ALJ hearing, means 
like or coordinated services or items provided to the same beneficiary 
by the appellants.
    Representative means an individual meeting the conditions described 
in Secs. 405.870 through 405.871.
    With reasonable promptness means within a period of 60 consecutive 
days after the receipt by the carrier of a request for payment.

determinations such as the following:
    (1) Whether services furnished are covered.
    (2) Whether the deductible has been met.
    (3) Whether the receipted bill or other evidence of payment is 
acceptable.
    (4) Whether the charges for services furnished are reasonable.
    (5) If the services furnished to a beneficiary by a physician or a 
supplier pursuant to an assignment under Sec. 424.55 of this chapter are 
not covered because they are determined to be not reasonable and 
necessary under Sec. 411.15(k) of this chapter, whether the beneficiary, 
physician or supplier, or a physician who meets the requirements of 
Sec. 411.408, knew or could reasonably have been expected to know at the 
time the services were furnished that the services were not covered.
    (c) The following are not initial determinations for purposes of 
this subpart:
    (1) Any issue or factor for which SSA or HCFA has sole 
responsibility, for example, whether an independent laboratory meets the 
conditions for coverage of services; whether a Medicare overpayment 
claim should be compromised, or collection action terminated or 
suspended.
    (2) Any issue or factor which relates to hospital insurance benefits 
under Medicare Part A.

    (a) General. A party to an initial determination by a carrier, who 
is dissatisfied with such initial determination, may request that the 
carrier review such determination. If a review is requested, such action 
shall not constitute a waiver of the right to hearing (see Sec. 405.820) 
subsequent to such review.
    (b) Place of filing request. A request for a carrier to review the 
initial determination is to be made in writing and filed at an office of

<R05>
Sec. 405.817  Principles for determining amount in controversy.

    (a) Individual appellants. For the purpose of determining whether an 
individual appellant meets the minimum amount in controversy needed for 
a carrier hearing ($100) or ALJ hearing ($500), the following rules 
apply:
    (1) The amount in controversy is computed as the actual amount 
charged the individual for the items and services in question, less any 
amount for which payment has been made by the carrier and less any 
deductible and coinsurance amounts applicable in the particular case.

[[Page 81]]

    (2) A single beneficiary may aggregate claims from two or more 
physicians/suppliers to meet the $100 or $500 thresholds. A single 
physician/supplier may aggregate claims from two or more beneficiaries 
to meet the $100 or $500 threshold levels of appeal.
    (3) In either of the circumstances specified in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section, two or more claims may be aggregated by an individual 
appellant to meet the amount in controversy for a carrier hearing only 
if the claims have previously been reviewed and a request for hearing 
has been made within six months after the date of the review 
determination(s).
    (4) In either of the circumstances specified in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section, two or more claims may be aggregated by an individual 
appellant to meet the amount in controversy for an ALJ hearing only if 
the claims have previously been decided by a carrier hearing officer and 
a request for an ALJ hearing has been made within 60 days after receipt 
of the carrier hearing officer decision(s).
    (5) When requesting a carrier hearing or an ALJ hearing, the 
appellant must specify in his or her appeal request the specific claims 
to be aggregated.
    (b) Two or more appellants. As specified in this paragraph, under 
section 1869(b)(2) of the Act, two or more appellants may aggregate 
their claims together to meet the minimum amount in controversy needed 
for an ALJ hearing ($500). The right to aggregate under this statutory 
provision applies to claims for items and services furnished on or after 
January 1, 1987.
    (1) The aggregate amount in controversy is computed as the actual 
amount charged the individual(s) for the items and services in question, 
less any amount for which payment has been made by the carrier and less 
any deductible and coinsurance amounts applicable in the particular 
case.
    (2) In determining the amount in controversy, two or more appellants 
may aggregate their claims together under the following circumstances:
    (i) Two or more beneficiaries may combine claims representing 
services from the same or different physician(s) or supplier(s) if the 
claims involve common issues of law and fact;
    (ii) Two or more physicians/suppliers may combine their claims if 
the claims involve the delivery of similar or related services to the 
same beneficiary;
    (iii) Two or more physicians/suppliers may combine their claims if 
the claims involve common issues of law and fact with respect to 
services furnished to two or more beneficiaries.
    (iv) In any of the circumstances specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) 
through (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the claims may be aggregated only 
if the claims have previously been decided by a carrier hearing 
officer(s) and a request for ALJ hearing has been made within 60 days 
after receipt of the carrier hearing officer decision(s). Moreover, in a 
request for ALJ hearing, the appellants must specify the claims that 
they seek to aggregate.
    (c) The determination as to whether the amount in controversy is 
$100 or more is made by the carrier hearing officer. The determination 
as to whether the amount in controversy is $500 or more is made by the 
ALJ.
    (d) In determining the amount in controversy under paragraph (b) of 
this section, the ALJ will also make the determination as to what 
constitutes ``similar or related services'' or ``common issues of law 
and fact.''
    (e) When a civil action is filed by either an individual appellant 
or two or more appellants, the Secretary may assert that the aggregation 
principles contained in this subpart may be applied to determine the 
amount in controversy for judicial review ($1000).
    (f) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(1) 
of this section, when payment is made for certain excluded services 
under Sec. 411.400 of this chapter or the liability of the beneficiary 
for those services is limited under Sec. 411.402 of this chapter, the 
amount in controversy is computed as the amount that would have been 
charged the beneficiary for the items or services in question, less any 
deductible and coinsurance amounts applicable in the particular case, 
had such expenses not been paid under Sec. 411.400 of this chapter or 
had such liability not been limited under Sec. 411.402 of this chapter.
    (g) Under this subpart, an appellant may not combine part A and part 
B

[[Page 82]]

claims together to meet the requisite amount in controversy for a 
carrier hearing or ALJ hearing. HMO, CMP and HCPP appellants under part 
417 of this chapter may combine part A and part B claims together to 
meet the requisite amount in controversy for a hearing.

Sec. 405.821  Request for carrier hearing.

    (a) A request for a carrier hearing is any clear expression in 
writing by a claimant asking for a hearing to adjudicate a claim when 
not acted upon with reasonable promptness or by a party to a review 
determination who states, in effect, that he or she is dissatisfied with 
the carrier's review determination and wants further opportunity to 
appeal the matter to the carrier.
    (b) The hearing request must be filed at an office of the carrier or 
at an office of SSA or HCFA.
    (c) Except when a carrier hearing is held because the carrier did 
not act upon a claim with reasonable promptness, a party to the review 
determination may request a carrier hearing within six months after the 
date of the notice of the review determination. The carrier may, upon 
request by the party affected, extend the period for filing the request 
for hearing.

    A hearing officer shall not conduct a hearing in any case in which 
he is prejudiced or partial with respect to any party, or if he has any 
interest in the matter before him. Notice of any objection with respect 
to the hearing officer who will conduct the hearing shall be made by the 
objecting party at his earliest opportunity. The hearing officer shall 
consider such objection and shall, at his discretion, withdraw. If the 
hearing officer withdraws, the appropriate official of the carrier shall 
designate another hearing officer to conduct the hearing. If the hearing 
officer does not withdraw, the objecting party may present his 
objections to the carrier for consideration at any time prior to the 
issuance of a decision. The carrier shall review the request and take 
appropriate action. The fact that a hearing officer is an employee of 
the carrier may not serve as prima facie cause for disqualification.

Sec. 405.830  Conduct of the carrier hearing.

    (a) General. Hearings shall be open to the parties and to such other 
persons as the hearing officer deems necessary and proper for the 
orderly and efficient conduct of the hearing. The hearing officer shall 
inquire fully into the matters at issue and shall receive in evidence 
the testimony of witnesses and any documents which are relevant and 
material to such matters. The parties shall be provided an opportunity 
to enter any objection to the inclusion of any document. The order in 
which evidence and allegations shall be presented and the procedure at 
the hearing, except as this subpart otherwise expressly provides, shall 
be at the discretion of the hearing officer and of such nature as to 
afford the parties a proper hearing.
    (b) Evidence. Evidence may be received at the hearing even though 
inadmissible under rules of evidence applicable to court procedures.
    (c) Witnesses. The hearing officer may examine the witnesses and 
shall allow the parties or their representatives to do so. If the 
hearing officer conducts the examination of a witness, he may allow the 
parties to suggest matters upon which they desire the witness to be 
questioned, and the hearing officer shall question the witness with 
respect to such matters if they are relevant and material to any issue 
pending for decision before him.
    (d) Oral argument and written allegations. The parties, upon their 
request shall be allowed a reasonable time for the presentation of oral 
argument or for the filing of briefs or other written statements or 
allegations of facts or law.
    (e) Consolidated issues. When one or more new issues are raised at 
any time after a request for hearing has been made, but before the 
mailing of notice of the decision, the hearing officer may, at his 
discretion, consider the issues along with the other issues pending 
before him on the same request for hearing.

<R05>
Sec. 405.831  Waiver of right to appear at carrier hearing and present evidence.

    If all parties waive their right to appear before the hearing 
officer and present evidence and contentions personally or by 
representative, it shall not be necessary for the hearing officer to 
give notice of or conduct a formal hearing as provided in Secs. 405.825 
through 405.830. A waiver of the right to appear is to be in writing and 
filed with the hearing officer or the carrier. Such waiver may be 
withdrawn by a party at any time prior to the mailing of notice of the 
decision in the case. Even though all of the parties have filed a waiver 
of the right to appear and present evidence and contentions at a hearing 
before the hearing officer, the hearing officer may, nevertheless, give 
notice of a time and place and conduct a hearing as provided in 
Secs. 405.825 through 405.830, if he believes that the personal 
appearance and testimony of the party or parties would assist him to 
ascertain the facts at issue in the case. For purposes of this section, 
failure of the parties to appear shall not be cause for a finding of 
abandonment and the hearing officer shall make his decision on the basis 
of all evidence adduced.

Sec. 405.832  Dismissal of request for carrier hearing.

    (a) By application of party. With the approval of the hearing 
officer, a request for a hearing may be withdrawn or dismissed at any 
time prior to the mailing of notice of the decision upon the application 
of the party or parties filing the request for such hearing. A party may 
request a dismissal by filing a written notice of such request with

[[Page 84]]

the carrier, the hearing officer or orally stating such request at the 
hearing. The dismissal of a request for hearing shall be binding unless 
vacated (see paragraph (d) of this section).
    (b) Dismissal by abandonment of party. A hearing officer may dismiss 
a request for hearing upon abandonment by the party or parties who filed 
the request. A party shall be deemed to have abandoned a request for 
hearing, other than where personal appearance is waived in accordance 
with Sec. 405.831, if neither the party nor his representative appears 
at the time and place fixed for the hearing and within 10 days after the 
mailing of a notice to him by the hearing officer to show cause, such 
party does not show good and sufficient cause for such failure to appear 
and failure to notify the hearing officer prior to the time fixed for 
hearing that he cannot appear.
    (c) Dismissal for cause. The hearing officer may, on his own motion, 
dismiss a hearing request, either entirely or as to any stated issue, 
under either of the following circumstances:
    (1) Where the party requesting a hearing is not a proper party under 
Sec. 405.822 or does not otherwise have a right to a hearing under 
section 1842(b)(3)(C) of the Act; or
    (2) Where the party who filed the hearing request dies and there is 
no information before the hearing officer showing that an individual who 
is not a party may be prejudiced by the carrier's determination.
    (d) Dismissal without prejudice. The hearing officer may on his own 
motion dismiss without prejudice a hearing request where the amount in 
controversy is less than $100.
    (e) Vacation of dismissal. A hearing officer may, on request of a 
party and for good and sufficient cause shown, vacate any dismissal of a 
request for hearing at any time within 6 months from the date of mailing 
notice of the dismissal to the party requesting the hearing at his last 
known address.

Sec. 405.860  Review of national coverage decisions (NCDs).

    (a) General. (1) HCFA makes NCDs either granting, limiting, or 
excluding Medicare coverage for a specific medical service, procedure or 
device. NCDs are made under section 1862(a)(1) of the Act or other 
applicable provisions of the Act. An NCD is binding on all Medicare 
carriers, fiscal intermediaries, PROs, HMOs, CMPs, and HCPPs when 
published in HCFA program manuals or the Federal Register.
    (2) Under section 1869(b)(3) of the Act, only NCDs made under 
section 1862(a)(1) of the Act are subject to the conditions of 
paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.
    (b) Review by ALJ. (1) An ALJ may not disregard, set aside, or 
otherwise review an NCD.
    (2) An ALJ may review the facts of a particular case to determine 
whether an NCD applies to a specific claim for benefits and, if so, 
whether the NCD has been applied correctly to the claim.
    (c) Review by Court. (1) A court's review of an NCD is limited to 
whether the record is incomplete or otherwise lacks adequate information 
to support the validity of the decision, unless the case has been 
remanded to the Secretary to supplement the record regarding the NCD. 
The court may not invalidate an NCD except upon review of the 
supplemented record.
    (2) A Federal court may not hold unlawful or set aside an NCD 
because it was not issued in accordance with the notice and comment 
procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or section 
1871(b) of the Act.
    (d) Remands--(1) Secretary's action. When a court remands an NCD 
matter to the Secretary because the record in support of the NCD is 
incomplete or otherwise lacks adequate information, the Secretary 
remands the case to HCFA in order to supplement the record.
    (2) Remand to HCFA. HCFA supplements the record with new or updated 
evidence, including additional information from other sources, and may 
issue a revised NCD.
    (3) Final Actions. (i) The proceedings to supplement the record, are 
expedited.

[[Page 87]]

    (ii) When HCFA does not issue a revised NCD, it returns the 
supplemented record to the court for review.
    (iii) When HCFA issues a revised NCD, it forwards the case to an ALJ 
who issues a new decision applying the revised NCD to the facts of the 
claim(s) under consideration. The ALJ's decision is subject to DAB 
review and, ultimately, judicial review.

with respect to the claim of such party to the same extent as such 
party. Notice to any party or any action, determination, or decision, or 
request to any party for the production of evidence, shall be sent to 
the representative of such party.


<R05>
Sec. 405.874  Appeals of carrier decisions that supplier standards are not met.

    (a) An entity serving as a National Supplier Clearinghouse must act 
promptly to determine if any entity submitting a request for a billing 
number as a Medicare supplier of part B items meets the standards set 
forth in part 424. Effective July 1, 1993, the National Supplier 
Clearinghouse must accept, reject or request additional information 
within 15 days of the receipt of an enrollment application.
    (b) If the National Supplier Clearinghouse disallows an entity's 
request for a billing number or revokes, with the concurrence of HCFA, 
an entity's billing number, the National Supplier Clearinghouse notifies 
the entity by certified mail. Revocation is effective 15 days after the 
National Supplier Clearinghouse mails notice of its determination. The 
carrier disallows payment for items furnished by the supplier beginning 
with that effective date. The notice must inform the entity of the 
reason for the rejection or revocation, its right to appeal, the date by 
which it must file that appeal (90 days after the postmark of the 
notice) and the address to which the appeal must be sent in writing.
    (c) A fair hearing officer not involved in the original 
determination to disallow an entity's request for a billing number, or 
to revoke an entity's billing number, must schedule a hearing to be held 
within one week of receipt of an appeal, or later at the request of the 
entity. Both the entity and carrier may offer evidence. The hearing 
officer issues notice of his/her decision within 2 weeks of the hearing. 
The notice is sent by certified letter to HCFA, the carrier, and the 
appealing entity. This notice must include information about the 
supplier's further right to appeal, the carrier's right to appeal, the 
date by which the appeal must be filed (90 days after the postmark of 
the notice) and the address to which the appeals must be sent in 
writing. Either the carrier or entity may appeal the hearings officer's 
decision to HCFA.
    (d) A HCFA official, designated by the Administrator of HCFA, must 
make an appeal decision based on the evidence presented to the fair 
hearing officer and his or her decision. The

[[Page 88]]

HCFA official requests any additional information he or she deems 
necessary from either the carrier or the entity within two weeks of 
receipt by the HCFA of the appeal. Notice of the HCFA official's 
decision--
    (1) Is issued within two weeks of when the last information is 
received is received by the HCFA official, or four weeks of when the 
information is requested, whichever is shorter, unless the party 
appealing the fair hearing decision requests a delay;
    (2) Is sent by the HCFA official by certified mail to both the 
carrier and the entity; and
    (3) Contains information on any further appeals the entity and 
carrier may have.
    (e) A billing number is not issued, or remains revoked, and payment 
is not made, for items or services furnished by any entity which a 
carrier determines does not qualify for a billing number, until the 
carrier (upon reapplication of the entity), a fair hearing officer, or a 
HCFA official designated to hear such appeals, determines that the 
entity qualifies for a billing number. Any claims for items or services 
furnished after revocation of the supplier's billing number and 
submitted by the entity during the appeals period are held and not 
processed, i.e., are neither approved, denied or developed, until all 
administrative appeals have been exhausted. If an entity is determined 
not to have qualified for a billing number in one period but to have 
qualified in another, the carrier pays for claims for items sold or 
rented to beneficiaries during the period the entity qualified as a 
supplier. If there is evidence of an overpayment, see subpart C of part 
405 of this Chapter.
    (f) A billing number may be reinstated after revocation when an 
entity completes a corrective action plan, to which HCFA has agreed, and 
provided sufficient assurance of its intent to comply fully with the 
supplier standards.

parts 413 and 412, respectively, of this chapter. In order to be 
reimbursed for covered services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries, 
providers of services are obliged to file cost reports with their 
intermediaries as specified in Sec. 413.24(f) of this chapter. Where the 
term ``provider'' appears in this subpart, it includes hospitals paid 
under the prospective payment system for purposes of applying the appeal 
procedures described in this subpart to those hospitals.
    (2) Other entities participating in Medicare Part A. In addition to 
providers of services whose status as such is indicated in the Act, 
there are entities (such as health maintenance organizations) that do 
not meet the statutory test for providers of services, which may also 
participate in Medicare. These entities are required to file periodic 
cost reports and are reimbursed on the basis of information furnished in 
the reports. Although the entities do not qualify for Board review, the 
rules as set forth in this subpart with respect to intermediary hearings 
are applicable to the entities to the maximum extent possible, for cost-
reporting periods ending on or after December 31, 1971, where the amount 
of program reimbursement in controversy is at least $1,000.
    (c) Effective dates. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and 
(c)(3) of this section or in Sec. 405.1885(e), this subpart applies to 
all cost reporting periods ending on or after December 31, 1971, for 
which reimbursement may be made on a reasonable cost basis.
    (2) Sections 405.1835 to 405.1877 apply only to cost reporting 
periods ending on or after June 30, 1973, for which reimbursement may be 
made on a reasonable cost basis.
    (3) With respect to hospitals under the prospective payment system 
(see part 412 of this chapter), the appeals procedures in Secs. 405.1811 
to 405.1877 that apply become applicable with the hospital's first cost 
reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1983.

Sec. 405.1803  Intermediary determination and notice of amount of program reimbursement.

    (a) General requirement. Upon receipt of a provider's cost report, 
or amended cost report where permitted or required, the intermediary 
must within a reasonable period of time (see

[[Page 90]]

Sec. 405.1835(b)), furnish the provider and other parties as appropriate 
(see Sec. 405.1805) a written notice reflecting the intermediary's 
determination of the total amount of reimbursement due the provider. The 
intermediary must include the following information in the notice, as 
appropriate:
    (1) Reasonable cost. The notice must--
    (i) Explain the intermediary's determination of total program 
reimbursement due the provider on the basis of reasonable cost for the 
reporting period covered by the cost report or amended cost report; and
    (ii) Relate this determination to the provider's claimed total 
program reimbursement due the provider for this period.
    (2) Prospective payment. With respect to a hospital that receives 
payments for inpatient hospital services under the prospective payment 
system (see part 412 of this chapter), the intermediary must include in 
the notice its determination of the total amount of the payments due the 
hospital under that system for the cost reporting period covered by the 
notice. The notice must explain (with appropriate use of the applicable 
money amounts) any difference in the amount determined to be due, and 
the amounts received by the hospital during the cost reporting period 
covered by the notice.
    (b) Requirements for intermediary notices. The intermediary must 
include in each notice appropriate references to law, regulations, HCFA 
Rulings, or program instructions to explain why the intermediary's 
determination of the amount of program reimbursement for the period 
differs from the amount the provider claimed. The notice must also 
inform the provider of its right to an intermediary or Board hearing 
(see Secs. 405.1809, 405.1811, 405.1815, 405.1835, and 405.1843) and 
that the provider must request the hearing within 180 days after the 
date of the notice.
    (c) Use of notice as basis for recoupment of overpayments. The 
intermediary's determination contained in its notice is the basis for 
making the retroactive adjustment (required by Sec. 413.64(f) of this 
chapter) to any program payments made to the provider during the period 
to which the determination applies, including recoupment under 
Sec. 405.373 from ongoing payments to the provider of any overpayments 
to the provider identified in the determination. Recoupment is made 
notwithstanding any request for hearing on the determination the 
provider may make under Sec. 405.1811 or Sec. 405.1835.

<R05>
Sec. 405.1804  Matters not subject to administrative and judicial review under prospective payment.

    Neither administrative nor judicial review is available for 
controversies about the following matters:
    (a) The determination of the requirement, or the proportional 
amount, of any budget neutrality adjustment in the prospective payment 
rates.
    (b) The establishment of--
    (1) Diagnosis related groups (DRGs);
    (2) The methodology for the classification of inpatient discharges 
within the DRGs; or
    (3) Appropriate weighting factors that reflect the relative hospital 
resources used with respect to discharge within each DRG.

Sec. 405.1807  Effect of intermediary determination.

    The determination shall be final and binding on the party or parties 
to such determination unless:
    (a) An intermediary hearing is requested in accordance with 
Sec. 405.1811 and an intermediary hearing decision rendered in 
accordance with Sec. 405.1831; or
    (b) The intermediary determination is revised in accordance with 
Sec. 405.1885; or

[[Page 91]]

    (c) A Board hearing is requested in accordance with Sec. 405.1835 
and a hearing decision rendered pursuant thereto.


<R05>
Sec. 405.1809  Intermediary hearing procedures.

    (a) Hearings. Each intermediary must establish and maintain written 
procedures for intermediary hearings, in accordance with the regulations 
in this subpart, for resolving issues that may arise between the 
intermediary and a provider concerning the amount of reasonable cost 
reimbursement, or prospective payment due the provider (except as 
provided in Sec. 405.1804) under the Medicare program. The procedures 
must provide for a hearing on the intermediary determination contained 
in the notice of program reimbursement (Sec. 405.1803), if the provider 
files a timely request for a hearing.
    (b) Amount in controversy. In order for an intermediary to grant a 
hearing, the following dates and amounts in controversy apply:
    (1) For cost reporting periods ending prior to June 30, 1973, the 
amount of program reimbursement in controversy must be at least $1000.
    (2) For cost reporting periods ending on or after June 30, 1973, the 
amount of program reimbursement in controversy must be at least $1000 
but less than $10,000.

<R05>
Sec. 405.1811  Right to intermediary hearing; time, place, form, and content of request for intermediary hearing.

    (a) A provider that has been furnished a notice of amount of program 
reimbursement may request an intermediary hearing if it is dissatisfied 
with the intermediary's determination contained in the notice and the 
amount in controversy requirement described in Sec. 405.1809 is met. The 
request must be in writing and be filed with the intermediary within 180 
calendar days after the date of the notice. (See Sec. 405.1835(c)). No 
other individual, entity, or party has the right to an intermediary 
hearing.
    (b) The request must (1) identify the aspect(s) of the determination 
with which the provider is dissatisfied, and (2) explain why the 
provider believes the determination on these matters is incorrect, and 
(3) be submitted with any documentary evidence the provider considers 
necessary to support its position.
    (c) Following the timely filing of the request for hearing, the 
provider may identify in writing, prior to the onset of the hearing 
proceedings, additional aspects of the determination with which it is 
dissatisfied and furnish any documentary evidence in support thereof. If 
such additional aspects are submitted, the hearing officer may postpone 
the hearing to allow for his examination of such additional aspects.

<R05>
Sec. 405.1813  Failure to timely request an intermediary hearing.

    If a provider requests an intermediary hearing on an intermediary's 
determination after the time limit prescribed in Sec. 405.1811, the 
designated intermediary hearing officer or panel of hearing officers 
will dismiss the request and furnish the provider a written notice that 
explains the time limitation, except that for good cause shown, the time 
limit prescribed in Sec. 405.1811 may be extended. However, an extension 
may not be granted if the extension request is filed more than 3 years 
after the date of the original notice of the intermediary determination.

<R05>
Sec. 405.1815  Parties to the intermediary hearing.

    The parties to the intermediary hearing shall be the parties to the 
intermediary determination and any other entity determined by the 
intermediary to be a related organization of such provider. Said parties 
shall be given reasonable notice of the time, date, and place of such 
hearing. Neither the intermediary nor the Health Care Financing 
Administration are parties (see Sec. 405.1819).

[[Page 92]]


<R05>
Sec. 405.1817  Hearing officer or panel of hearing officers authorized to conduct intermediary hearing; disqualification of officers.

    The intermediary hearing provided for in Sec. 405.1809 shall be 
conducted by a hearing officer or panel of hearing officers designated 
by the intermediary. Such hearing officer or officers shall be persons 
knowledgeable in the field of health care reimbursement. The hearing 
officer or officers shall not have had any direct responsibility for the 
program reimbursement determination with respect to which a request for 
hearing is filed; no hearing officer (or officers) shall conduct a 
hearing in a case in which he is prejudiced or partial with respect to 
any party, or where he has any interest in the matter pending for 
determination before him. Notice of any objection which a party may have 
with respect to a hearing officer shall be presented in writing to such 
officer by the objecting party at the party's earliest opportunity. The 
hearing officer shall consider the objection and shall, at his 
discretion, either proceed in the conduct of the hearing or withdraw. If 
the hearing officer does not withdraw, the objecting party may, after 
the hearing, present his objections to an executive official of the 
intermediary, who shall rule promptly on the objection.


<R05>
Sec. 405.1819  Conduct of intermediary hearing.

    The hearing shall be open to all parties thereto (see Sec. 405.1815) 
and to representatives of the intermediary and of the Health Care 
Financing Administration (see Sec. 405.1815). The hearing officer(s) 
shall inquire fully into all of the matters at issue and shall receive 
into evidence the testimony and any documents which are relevant and 
material to such matters. If the hearing officer(s) believes that there 
is relevant and material evidence available which has not been presented 
at the hearing, he (they) may, at any time prior to the mailing of 
notice of the decision, reopen the hearing record for the receipt of 
such evidence. The order in which the evidence and the allegations shall 
be presented and the conduct of the hearing shall be at the discretion 
of the hearing officer(s).


<R05>
Sec. 405.1821  Prehearing discovery and other proceedings prior to the intermediary hearing.

    (a) Prehearing discovery shall be permitted upon timely request of 
any party. To be timely, a request for discovery and inspection shall be 
made before the beginning of the hearing. A reasonable time for 
inspection and reproduction of documents shall be provided by order of 
the hearing officer(s).
    (b) If, in the discretion of the hearing officer(s), the purpose of 
defining the issues more clearly would be served, the hearing officer(s) 
may schedule a prehearing conference. For this purpose, a single member 
of a panel of hearing officers, when such is the case, may be appointed 
to act for the panel with respect to prehearing activities.


<R05>
Sec. 405.1823  Evidence at intermediary hearing.

    Evidence may be received at the intermediary hearing even though 
inadmissible under the rules of evidence applicable to court procedure. 
The hearing officer(s) shall give the parties opportunity for submission 
and consideration of facts and arguments, and during the course of the 
hearing, should in ruling upon admissibility of evidence, exclude 
irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. The hearing 
officer(s) shall render a final ruling on the admissibility of evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 405.1825  Witnesses at intermediary hearing.

    The hearing officer(s) may examine the witnesses and shall allow the 
parties and their representatives to do so. Parties to the proceedings 
may also cross-examine witnesses.


<R05>
Sec. 405.1827  Record of intermediary hearing.

    A complete recordation of the proceedings at the intermediary 
hearing shall be made and transcribed in all cases. It shall be made 
available to any party upon request. The record will not be closed until 
a decision (see Sec. 405.1831) has been issued.

<R05>
Sec. 405.1829  Authority of hearing officer(s) at intermediary hearing.

    (a) The hearing officer(s) in exercising his authority must comply 
with all the provisions of title XVIII of the Act and regulations issued 
thereunder, as well as with HCFA Rulings issued under the authority of 
the Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration (see 42 
CFR 401.108), and with the general instructions issued by the Health 
Care Financing Administration in accordance with the Secretary's 
agreement with the intermediary.
    (b) The determination of a fiscal intermediary that no payment may 
be made under title XVIII of the Act for any expense incurred for items 
and services furnished to an individual because such items and services 
are excluded from coverage pursuant to section 1862 of the Act, 42 
U.S.C. 1395y (see subpart C of this part), shall not be reviewed by the 
hearing officer(s). Such determination shall be reviewed only in 
accordance with the applicable provisions of subparts G and H of this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 405.1831  Intermediary hearing decision and notice.

    The hearing officer(s) shall, on a timely basis, render a decision 
in writing based on the evidence in the record; such decision shall 
constitute the final determination of the intermediary. In such 
decision, he will cite applicable law, regulations, HCFA Rulings, and 
general instructions of the Health Care Financing Administration, as 
well as findings on all the matters in issue at the hearing. A copy of 
the decision will be mailed to all parties to the hearing at their last 
known addresses.


<R05>
Sec. 405.1833  Effect of intermediary hearing decision.

    The intermediary hearing decision provided for in Sec. 405.1831 
shall be final and binding upon all parties to the hearing unless such 
intermediary determination is revised in accordance with Sec. 405.1885.


<R05>
Sec. 405.1835  Right to Board hearing.

    (a) Criteria. The provider (but no other individual, entity, or 
party) has a right to a hearing before the Board about any matter 
designated in Sec. 405.1801(a)(1), if:
    (1) An intermediary determination has been made with respect to the 
provider; and
    (2) The provider has filed a written request for a hearing before 
the Board under the provisions described in Sec. 405.1841(a)(1); and
    (3) The amount in controversy (as determined in Sec. 405.1839(a)) is 
$10,000 or more.
    (b) Prospective payment exceptions. Except with respect to matters 
for which administrative or judicial review is not permitted as 
specified in Sec. 405.1804, hospitals that are paid under the 
prospective payment system are entitled to hearings before the Board 
under this section if they otherwise meet the criteria described in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Right to hearing based on late intermediary determination about 
reasonable cost. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section, the provider also has a right to a hearing before the 
Board if an intermediary's determination concerning the amount of 
reasonable cost reimbursement due a provider is not rendered within 12 
months after receipt by the intermediary of a provider's perfected cost 
report or amended cost report (as permitted or as required to furnish 
sufficient data for purposes of making such determination--see 
Sec. 405.1803(a)) provided such delay was not occasioned by the fault of 
the provider.

<R05>
Sec. 405.1837  Group appeal.

    (a) Criteria for group appeals. Subject to paragraph (b) of this 
section, a group of providers may bring an appeal before the Board but 
only if--
    (1) Each provider in the group is identified as one which would, 
upon the filing of a request for a hearing before the Board, but without 
regard to the $10,000 amount in controversy requirement, be entitled to 
a hearing under Sec. 405.1835;
    (2) The matters at issue involve a common question of fact or of 
interpretation of law, regulations or HCFA Rulings; and
    (3) The amount in controversy is, in the aggregate, $50,000 or more.

[[Page 94]]

    (b) Providers under common ownership or control. Effective April 20, 
1983, any appeal filed by providers that are under common ownership or 
control must be brought by the providers as a group appeal in accordance 
with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to any 
matters involving an issue common to the providers and for which the 
amount in controversy is, in the aggregate, $50,000 or more (see 
Sec. 405.1841(a)(2)). A single provider involved in a group appeal that 
also wishes to appeal issues that are not common to the other providers 
in the group must file a separate hearing request (see 
Sec. 405.1841(a)(1)) and must separately meet the requirements in 
Sec. 405.1811 or Sec. 405.1835, as applicable.

Sec. 405.1839  Amount in controversy.

    (a) Single appeals. The $1,000 amount in controversy required under 
Sec. 405.1809 for an intermediary hearing and the $10,000 amount in 
controversy required under Sec. 405.1835 for a Board hearing is, as 
applicable to the matters for which the provider has requested a 
hearing, the combined total of the amounts computed as follows:
    (1) Providers under prospective payment. For providers that are paid 
under the prospective payment system, by deducting--
    (i) The total of the payment due the provider on other than a 
reasonable cost basis under the prospective payment system from the 
total amount that would be payable after a recomputation that takes into 
account any exclusion, exception, adjustment, or additional payment 
denied the provider under part 412 of this chapter, as applicable;
    (ii) The total of the payment due the provider on a reasonable cost 
basis under the prospective payment system from the total reimbursable 
costs claimed by the provider; and
    (iii) The adjusted total reimbursable costs due the provider on a 
reasonable cost basis under other than the prospective payment system 
from the total reimbursable costs claimed by the provider.
    (2) Providers not under prospective payment. For providers that are 
not paid under the prospective payment system, by deducting the adjusted 
total reimbursable program costs due the provider on a reasonable cost 
basis from the total reimbursable costs claimed by the provider.
    (b) Group appeals. The $50,000 amount in controversy required under 
Sec. 405.1837 for group appeals to the Board is, as applicable to the 
common matters for which the group of providers have requested a 
hearing, the combined total of the amounts computed as follows:
    (1) Providers under prospective payment. For providers that are paid 
under the prospective payment system, by deducting--
    (i) The total of the payment due the providers (in the aggregate) on 
other than a reasonable cost basis under the prospective payment system 
from the total amount that would be payable to the providers (in the 
aggregate) after a recomputation that takes into account any applicable 
exception, exclusion, adjustment, or additional payment denied the 
providers under part 412 of this chapter.
    (ii) The total of the payment due the providers (in the aggregate) 
on a reasonable cost basis under the prospective payment system from the 
total reimbursable costs claimed in the aggregate by the providers; and
    (iii) The adjusted total reimbursable costs due the providers (in 
the aggregate) on a reasonable cost basis under other than the 
prospective payment system from the total reimbursable costs claimed in 
the aggregate by the providers.
    (2) Providers not under prospective payment. For providers that are 
not paid under the prospective payment system, by deducting the adjusted 
total reimbursable program costs due the providers (in the aggregate) on 
a reasonable cost basis from the total reimbursable costs claimed in the 
aggregate by the providers.

<R05>
Sec. 405.1841  Time, place, form, and content of request for Board hearing.

    (a) General requirements. (1) The request for a Board hearing must 
be filed in writing with the Board within 180 days of the date the 
notice of the intermediary's determination was mailed to the provider 
or, where notice

[[Page 95]]

of the determination was not timely rendered, within 180 days after the 
expiration of the period specified in Sec. 405.1835(c). Such request for 
Board hearing must identify the aspects of the determination with which 
the provider is dissatisfied, explain why the provider believes the 
determination is incorrect in such particulars, and be accompanied by 
any documenting evidence the provider considers necessary to support its 
position. Prior to the commencement of the hearing proceedings, the 
provider may identify in writing additional aspects of the 
intermediary's determination with which it is dissatisfied and furnish 
any documentary evidence in support thereof.
    (2) Effective April 20, 1983, any request for a Board hearing by 
providers that are under common ownership or control (see Sec. 413.17 of 
this chapter) must be brought by the providers as a group appeal (see 
Sec. 405.1837(b)) with respect to any matters at issue involving a 
question of fact or of interpretation of law, regulations, or HCFA 
Rulings common to the providers and for which the amount in controversy 
is $50,000 or more in the aggregate. If a group appeal is filed, the 
provider seeking the appeal must be separately identified in the request 
for hearing, which must be prepared and filed consistently with the 
requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (b) Extension of time limit for good cause. A request for a Board 
hearing filed after the time limit prescribed in paragraph (a) of this 
section shall be dismissed by the Board, except that for good cause 
shown, the time limit may be extended. However, no such extension shall 
be granted by the Board if such request is filed more than 3 years after 
the date the notice of the intermediary's determination is mailed to the 
provider.

[48 FR 39836, Sept. 1, 1983, as amended at 51 FR 34793, Sept. 30, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 405.1842  Expediting Board proceedings.

    (a) Basis and purpose. This section implements section 1878(f)(1) of 
the Social Security Act, as amended by section 955 of Public Law 96-499 
(42 U.S.C. 1395oo(f)(1)). The amendment provides an opportunity for 
providers to obtain expedited administrative review when the Board 
determines that it does not have the authority to decide a question of 
law, regulation, or HCFA Ruling relevant to the case (see 
Sec. 405.1867).
    (b) Basic rule. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this 
section, a provider may submit a written request to the Board, with 
supporting documentation, to determine whether the Board has the 
authority to decide a question of law, regulations, or HCFA Rulings 
relevant to and controlling upon an issue to be reviewed by the Board. 
The Board is required to make an expedited review determination in 
writing, either denying or granting the request, within 30 days after 
the date of receipt of the request, as defined in paragraph (1) of this 
section. The Board may also issue a determination on its own motion that 
it lacks authority to decide a question of law, regulations or HCFA 
Rulings.
    (2) The Board must determine that the provider (including each 
provider in a group appeal) is entitled to a hearing under section 
1878(a) of the Act before making the determination described in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Thus, the provider must file (or have 
already filed) a written request for a Board hearing that meets the 
requirements in Sec. 405.1841. The information and documentation 
required with respect to the filing of a request for a hearing is used 
by the Board to determine jurisdiction under section 1878(a) of the Act.
    (3) A provider's request for an expedited review determination 
cannot be considered to be filed with the Board, nor can the 30-day time 
period during which the Board is required to make an expedited review 
determination begin, until such time as the Board accepts jurisdiction 
of the case.
    (4) Proceedings conducted by the Board under an authority other than 
section 1878(a) of the Act and Secs. 405.1835 through 405.1873 of this 
subpart are not hearings for purposes of this section and are not 
subject to the expedited Board proceedings set forth in this section. 
For example, proceedings concerning reimbursement for capital 
expenditures conducted under section 1122(f) of the Act and 
Sec. 405.1890 of this

[[Page 96]]

subpart are not hearings for purposes of this section. (Section 1122(f) 
specifically bars any administrative or judicial review.)
    (c) ``Own motion'' review. If the Board is considering issuing a 
determination on its own motion that it lacks the authority to decide a 
question of law, regulations, or HCFA Rulings, it will notify the 
provider and intermediary of its proposed determination and allow them a 
reasonable period of time to file evidence or arguments either to 
support or oppose the proposed determination.
    (d) Provider requests. (1) If a provider seeks an expedited Board 
proceeding, it must--(i) File its appropriately documented request in 
writing with the Board; and
    (ii) Send a copy of the request and documentation simultaneously to 
the intermediary.
    (2) The request to the Board for an expedited review determination 
must--(i) Identify the issues and the controlling law, regulation or 
HCFA Ruling for which the Board is to make a determination;
    (ii) Allege and demonstrate that there are no factual issues in 
dispute;
    (iii) Contain an explanation of why the provider believes the Board 
cannot decide the legal issue or issues that are in dispute; and
    (iv) Include all other information or details that support the 
request.
    (3) If the information in the provider request is insufficient for 
the Board to determine whether it has the authority to decide an issue, 
the Board will request more information from the provider. Such a 
request will affect the 30-day time limit as provided in paragraph (i) 
of this section. If the provider does not send more information or sends 
inadequate information, the Board will determine that it has the 
authority to decide the issue and will begin the regular procedure for a 
hearing.
    (e) Intermediary participation. (1) After receiving a copy of the 
provider's request for an expedited review determination, the 
intermediary may send comments to the Board on the provider's request 
and supporting documentation. The intermediary will send a copy of its 
comments to the provider simultaneously.
    (2) If the intermediary's comments raise questions about the 
provider's request for expedited review, the Board may request 
additional information from the provider as provided in paragraph (d)(3) 
of this section.
    (f) Criteria for a Board determination. The Board will review all 
documentation forwarded by the provider and the intermediary relevant to 
the request for a Board determination concerning the Board's authority 
to decide an issue. In its review, the Board will consider--
    (1) The controlling facts in the case;
    (2) The applicability of law, regulations, or HCFA rulings;
    (3) Whether there are factual issues for the Board to resolve; and
    (4) Whether there are legal issues within the authority of the Board 
to decide.
    (g) Board determination. (1) Within 30 days after the date of 
receipt (as defined in paragraph (i) of this section) of a provider's 
request and all necessary documentation the Board will issue a 
determination concerning its authority to decide the question of law, 
regulations, or HCFA Rulings relevant to the issues identified by the 
provider in its request.
    (2) If there are factual or legal issues in dispute on an issue 
within the authority of the Board to decide, the Board will not make an 
expedited review determination on the particular issue but will proceed 
with a hearing. The Board has the authority to decide when two or more 
issues are sufficiently related to preclude separation for purposes of 
an expedited review determination on one or more of them and a hearing 
on the other or others.
    (3) The Board will promptly notify the provider in writing of its 
determination and will send a copy of the determination to the 
intermediary.
    (4) The Board's determination concerning its authority or its lack 
of a determination is not subject to the Secretary's review under 
Sec. 405.1875.
    (h) Effect of a Board decision. (1) The Board's determination, 
issued on its own motion or at the request of a provider, that it lacks 
authority to decide a question of law, regulations or HCFA

[[Page 97]]

Rulings is a final decision permitting a provider to seek judicial 
review with respect to the matter or matters in controversy contained in 
the determination, within 60 days of the date of the Board's 
determination.
    (2) After the Board has determined that it does not have the 
authority to decide an issue, the provider will not be granted a hearing 
on the same issue.
    (3) If the Board fails to issue an expedited review determination 
within 30 days of the date of receipt of a complete request (as 
determined under paragraph (i) of this section), the provider may, 
within 60 days from the end of that period, seek judicial review of the 
matters for which it requested the Board's determination.
    (4) If the Board fails to make an expedited review determination 
within the required 30 days, it will begin regular hearing procedures as 
though it has the authority to decide the issue.
    (5) If the provider seeks judicial review because the Board fails to 
make a determination as provided in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, it 
should notify the Board at the time it files for judicial review. The 
Board will not hold a hearing, even if one has been scheduled, on the 
matter or matters for which the provider is seeking judicial review.
    (6) The Board's determination does not affect the right of the 
provider to a Board hearing for issues for which the provider did not 
request expedited review, or for which the Board determines it does have 
the authority to decide, or for which the Board did not make a 
determination and the provider did not request judicial review.
    (i) Date of receipt. For purposes of this section, the date of 
receipt of the provider's request is the later of--
    (1) The actual date of receipt by the Board of the information 
required under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, or of additional 
information requested by the Board under paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section, whichever the Board receives later; or
    (2) The date indicated on the Board's written notification to the 
provider that the Board has accepted jurisdiction of the case.
    (j) Examples. Below are examples showing when a provider may expect 
to receive an expedited review determination, in relation to various 
circumstances affecting its request for the determination.
    (1) The provider requests a hearing and expedited review at or about 
the same time. If all information is complete, the Board could send 
notification that it has accepted jurisdiction of the case and the 
expedited review determination simultaneously.
    (2) The provider requests both a hearing and an expedited review 
determination, and supplies complete information. The Board accepts 
jurisdiction but, for example, because of the complexity of the case, 
the Board makes its expedited review determination within 30 days after 
it has accepted jurisdiction.
    (3) The provider requests both a hearing and an expedited review 
determination, but the request for a hearing does not contain enough 
information for the Board to determine jurisdiction. The Board would 
request more information to determine jurisdiction and would make its 
expedited review determination within 30 days after it has accepted 
jurisdiction.
    (4) The provider requests both a hearing and an expedited review 
determination, but does not send enough information for the Board to 
make an expedited review determination. Assuming the Board accepts 
jurisdiction, the Board would request more information about the request 
for expedited review and make its determination within 30 days after it 
receives the additional information.
    (5) The provider requests an expedited review determination after 
the Board has accepted jurisdiction. The Board would make its 
determination within 30 days after receipt of an appropriately 
documented request for an expedited review determination.

<R05>
Sec. 405.1847  Disqualification of Board members.

    No Board member shall join in the conduct of a hearing in a case in 
which he is prejudiced or partial with respect to any party or in which 
he has any interest in the matter pending for decision before him. 
Notice of any objection which a party may have with respect to a Board 
member shall be presented in writing to such Board member by the 
objecting party at its earliest opportunity. The Board member shall 
consider the objection and shall, in his discretion, either proceed to

the objecting party may petition the Board, presenting its objection and 
reasons therefor, and be entitled to a ruling thereon before the hearing 
can proceed.


<R05>
Sec. 405.1849  Establishment of time and place of hearing by the Board.

    The Board shall fix the time and place for the hearing and shall 
mail written notice thereof to the parties at their last known 
addresses, not less than 30 days prior to the scheduled time. Either on 
its own motion or for good cause shown by a party, the Board may, as

provided that reasonable written notice is given to the parties.


<R05>
Sec. 405.1851  Conduct of Board hearing.

    The Board hearing shall be open to the parties, to representatives 
of the Health Care Financing Administration, and to such other persons 
as the Board deems necessary and proper. The Board shall inquire fully 
into all of the matters at issue and shall receive into evidence the 
testimony of witnesses and any documents which are relevant and material 
to such matters. If the Board believes that there is relevant and 
material evidence available which has not been presented at the hearing, 
it may at any time prior to the mailing of notice of the decision, 
reconvene the hearing for the receipt of such evidence. The order in 
which the evidence and the allegations shall be presented and the 
conduct of the hearing shall be at the discretion of the Board.

[[Page 99]]


<R05>
Sec. 405.1853  Prehearing discovery and other proceedings prior to the Board hearing.

    (a) Upon notification that a request for Board hearing has been 
filed, the intermediary shall forthwith review the materials submitted 
by the provider in accordance with Sec. 405.1841. Simultaneously, the 
intermediary shall review the information which formed the basis for its 
determination of the amount of program reimbursement. Based on the 
findings of such review, the intermediary shall expeditiously attempt to 
join with the provider in written stipulations setting forth the issues 
that said review has resolved and designating the issues that remain for 
Board resolution. Having obtained such stipulations and being satisfied 
that no further agreements can be negotiated, the intermediary shall 
ensure that all available documentary evidence in support of each 
party's position is part of the record. Such evidence will ordinarily 
include a position paper from the provider, a position paper from the 
intermediary, and any documents which support the issues addressed in 
the stipulations. These materials, in addition to all relevant documents 
which formed the basis for its determination of the amount of program 
reimbursement, shall be forwarded to the Board within 60 days after the 
date of the provider's request for Board review.
    (b) Prehearing discovery shall be permitted upon timely request of a 
party. To be timely, a request for discovery and inspection shall be 
made before the beginning of the hearing. A reasonable time for 
inspection and reproduction of documents shall be provided by order of 
the Board. The Board's order on all discovery matters shall be final.
    (c) If, in the discretion of the Board, the purpose of defining the 
issues more clearly would be served, the Board may schedule a prehearing 
conference. For this purpose, a single member of the Board may be 
appointed to act for the Board with respect to prehearing activities.


<R05>
Sec. 405.1855  Evidence at Board hearing.

    Evidence may be received at the Board hearing even though 
inadmissible under the rules of evidence applicable to court procedure. 
The Board shall give the parties opportunity for submission and 
consideration of facts and arguments and during the course of the 
hearing should, in ruling upon admissibility of evidence, exclude 
irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. The Board shall 
render a final ruling on the admissibility of evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 405.1857  Subpoenas.

    When reasonably necessary for the full presentation of a case, the 
Board may, either upon its own motion or upon the request of a party, 
issue subpoenas for the attendance and testimony of witnesses and for 
the production of books, records, correspondence, papers, or other 
documents which are relevant and material to any matter in issue at the 
hearing. Parties who desire the issuance of a subpoena shall, not less 
than 10 days prior to the time fixed for the hearing, file with the 
Board a written request therefor, designating the witnesses or documents 
to be produced, and describing the address, or location thereof with 
sufficient particularity to permit such witnesses or documents to be 
found. The request for a subpoena shall state the pertinent facts which 
the party expects to establish by such witnesses or documents and 
whether such facts could be established by other evidence without the 
use of a subpoena. Subpoenas, as provided for above, shall be issued in 
the name of the Board, and the Health Care Financing Administration 
shall assume the cost of the issuance and the fees and mileage of any 
witness so subpoenaed, as provided in section 205(d) of the Act, 42 
U.S.C. 405(d).


<R05>
Sec. 405.1859  Witnesses.

    Witnesses at the hearing shall testify under oath or affirmation, 
unless excused by the Board for cause. The Board may examine the 
witnesses and shall allow the parties or their representatives to do so. 
Parties to the proceeding may also cross-examine witnesses.


<R05>
Sec. 405.1861  Oral argument and written allegations.

    The parties, upon their request, shall be allowed a reasonable time 
for the

[[Page 100]]

presentation of oral argument or for the filing of briefs or other 
written statements of allegations as to facts or law. Copies of any 
brief or other written statement shall be filed in sufficient number 
that they may be made available to all parties and to the Health Care 
Financing Administration.


<R05>
Sec. 405.1863  Administrative policy at issue.

    Where a party to the Board hearing puts into issue an administrative 
policy which is interpretative of the law or regulations, the Board will 
promptly notify to the Health Care Financing Administration.


<R05>
Sec. 405.1865  Record of Board hearing.

    A complete record of the proceedings at the hearing shall be made 
and transcribed in all cases. It shall be made available to the parties 
upon request. The record will not be closed until a decision has been 
issued.


<R05>
Sec. 405.1867  Sources of Board's authority.

    In exercising its authority to conduct the hearings described 
herein, the Board must comply with all the provisions of title XVIII of 
the Act and regulations issued thereunder, as well as HCFA Rulings 
issued under the authority of the Administrator of the Health Care 
Financing Administration (see Sec. 401.108 of this subchapter). The 
Board shall afford great weight to interpretive rules, general 
statements of policy, and rules of agency organization, procedure, or 
practice established by HCFA.

[48 FR 22925, May 23, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 405.1869  Scope of Board's decision-making authority.

    The Board shall have the power to affirm, modify, or reverse a 
determination of an intermediary with respect to a cost report and to 
make any other modifications on matters covered by such cost report 
(including modifications adverse to the provider or other parties) even 
though such matters were not considered in the intermediary's 
determination. The opinion of the majority of those Board members 
deciding the case will constitute the Board's decision.


<R05>
Sec. 405.1871  Board hearing decision and notice.

    (a) The Board shall, as soon as practicable after the conclusion of 
its hearing, render a written decision based upon the record made at 
such hearing, the record established in support of the determination of 
the intermediary (see Sec. 405.1803), and such other evidence as may be 
obtained or received by the Board. Such Board decision shall be 
supported by substantial evidence when the record of the Board hearing 
is viewed as a whole and shall cite applicable law, regulations, and 
HCFA Rulings. A copy of the decision shall be mailed to all parties to 
the hearing at their last known addresses and, at the same time, to the 
Administrator and HCFA.
    (b) The decision of the Board provided for in paragraph (a) of this 
section shall be final and binding upon all parties to the hearing 
before the Board unless it is reviewed by the Secretary in accordance 
with Sec. 405.1875, or revised in accordance with Sec. 405.1885.

<R05>
Sec. 405.1873  Board's jurisdiction.

    (a) Board decides jurisdiction. The Board decides questions relating 
to its jurisdiction to grant a hearing, including (1) the timeliness of 
an intermediary determination (see Sec. 405.1835(c)), and (2) the right 
of a provider to a hearing before the Board when the amount in 
controversy is in issue (see Secs. 405.1835(a)(3) and 405.1837).
    (b) Matters not subject to board review. (1) The determination of a 
fiscal intermediary that no payment may be made under title XVIII of the 
Act for any expenses incurred for items and services furnished to an 
individual because such items and services are excluded from coverage 
pursuant to section 1862 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 1395y (see subpart C of 
this part), may not be reviewed by the Board. (Such determination shall 
be reviewed only in accordance with the applicable provisions of subpart 
G or H of this part.)

[[Page 101]]

    (2) The Board may not review certain matters affecting payments to 
hospitals under the prospective payment system as provided in 
Sec. 405.1804.

[48 FR 39836, Sept. 1, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 405.1875  Administrator's review.

    (a) General rule. (1) Except for a Board determination under 
Sec. 405.1842 that it lacks the authority to decide an issue, the 
Administrator, at his or her discretion, may review any final decision 
of the Board, including a decision under Sec. 405.1873 about the Board's 
jurisdiction to grant a hearing. The Administrator may exercise this 
discretion on his or her own motion, in response to a request from a 
party to a Board hearing or in response to a request from HCFA.
    (2) The Office of the Attorney Advisory will examine the Board's 
decisions, the requests made by a party or HCFA and any submission made 
in accordance with the provisions of this section in order to assist the 
Administrator in deciding whether to exercise this review authority.
    (b) Request for review. A party or HCFA requesting the Administrator 
to review a Board decision must file a written request with the 
Administrator within 15 days of the receipt of the Board decision.
    (c) Criteria for deciding whether to review. In deciding whether to 
review a Board decision, either on his or her own motion or in response 
to a request from a party to the hearing or HCFA, the Administrator will 
normally consider whether it appears that:
    (1) The Board made an erroneous interpretation of law, regulation or 
HCFA Ruling;
    (2) The Board's decision is not supported by substantial evidence; 
or
    (3) The case presents a significant policy issue having a basis in 
law and regulations, and review is likely to lead to the issuance of a 
HCFA Ruling or other directive needed to clarify a statutory or 
regulatory provision;
    (4) The Board has incorrectly assumed or denied jurisdiction or 
extended its authority to a degree not provided for by statute, 
regulation or HCFA Ruling; and
    (5) The decision of the Board requires clarification, amplification, 
or an alternative legal basis for the decision.
    (d) Decision to review. (1) Whether or not a party or HCFA has 
requested review, the Administrator will promptly notify the parties and 
HCFA whether he or she has decided to review a decision of the Board 
and, if so, will indicate the particular issues he or she will consider.
    (2) The Administrator may decline to review a case or any issue in a 
case even if a party has filed a written request for review under 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (e) Written submissions. (1) Within 15 days of receipt of a notice 
that the Administrator has decided to review a Board decision, a party 
or HCFA may submit to the Administrator, in writing:
    (i) Proposed findings and conclusions;
    (ii) Supporting views or exceptions to the Board decision;
    (iii) Supporting reasons for the exceptions and proposed findings; 
and
    (iv) A rebuttal of the other party's request for review or other 
submissions already filed with the Administrator.
    (2) These submissions shall be limited to issues the Administrator 
has decided to review and confined to the record of the Board hearing.
    (3) A party or HCFA, within 15 days of receipt of a notice that the 
Administrator has decided to review a decision, may also request that 
the decision be remanded and state reasons for doing so. Reasons for a 
request to remand may include new, substantial evidence concerning--
    (i) Issues presented to the Board; and
    (ii) New issues that have arisen since the case was presented to the 
Board.
    (4) A copy of any written submission made under this paragraph shall 
be sent simultaneously to each other party to the Board hearing and to 
HCFA, if HCFA has previously--
    (i) Requested that the Administrator review a Board decision or 
filed a written submission in response to a party's request for review.
    (ii) Responded to a party's request for review; or
    (iii) Submitted material after the Administrator has announced that 
he or she will review a Board decision.

[[Page 102]]

    (f) Ex parte communications prohibited. All communications from any 
of the parties or HCFA about a Board decision being reviewed by the 
Administrator must be in writing and must contain a certification that 
copies have been served on the parties and HCFA, as appropriate. The 
Administrator will not consider any communication that does not meet 
these requirements or is not submitted within the required time limits.
    (g) Administrator's decision. (1) If the Administrator has notified 
the parties and HCFA that he or she has decided to review a Board 
decision, the Administrator will affirm, reverse, modify or remand the 
case.
    (2) The Administrator will make this decision within 60 days after 
the provider received notification of the Board decision and will 
promptly mail a copy of the decision to each party and to HCFA.
    (3) Any decision other than to remand will be confined to--
    (i) The record of the Board, as forwarded by the Board;
    (ii) Any materials submitted under paragraphs (b) or (e) of this 
section; and
    (iii) Generally known facts that are not subject to reasonable 
dispute.
    (4) The Administrator may rely on prior decisions of the Board, the 
Administrator and the courts, and other applicable law, whether or not 
cited by the parties and HCFA.
    (h) Remand. (1) A remand to the Board by the Administrator vacates 
the Board's decision.
    (2) The Administrator may direct the Board to take further action 
with respect to the development of additional facts or new issues, or to 
consider the applicability of laws or regulations other than those 
considered by the Board. The following are not acceptable bases for 
remand--
    (i) Presentation of evidence existing at the time of the Board 
hearing that was known or reasonably could have been known;
    (ii) Introduction of a favorable court case that was either not 
available in print at the time of the Board hearing or was decided after 
the Board hearing;
    (iii) Change of a party's representation before the Board;
    (iv) Presentation of an alternative legal basis concerning an issue 
in dispute; or
    (v) Attempted retraction of a waiver of a right made before or at 
the Board hearing.
    (3) After remand, the Board will take the action requested in the 
remand action and issue a new decision.
    (4) The new decision will be final unless the Administrator 
reverses, affirms, modifies, or again remands the decision in accordance 
with the provisions of the section.

[48 FR 45773, Oct. 7, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 405.1877  Judicial review.

    (a) General rule. Section 1878(f) of the Act permits a provider to 
obtain judicial review of a final decision of the Board, or of a 
reversal, affirmation, or modification by the Administrator of a Board 
decision, by filing a civil action pursuant to the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure within 60 days of the date on which the provider 
received notice of--
    (1) A final decision by the Board; or
    (2) Any reversal, affirmance, or modification by the Administrator.

The Board's decision is not final if the Administrator reverses, affirms 
or modifies the decision within 60 days of the date on which the 
provider received notice of the decision.
    (b) Administrator declines to review a Board decision. If the 
Administrator declines to review a Board decision, the provider must 
file its appeal within 60 days of receipt of the decision of the Board.
    (c) Administrator does not act after reviewing a Board decision. If 
the Administrator notifies the parties that he or she has decided to 
review a Board decision and then does not make a decision within the 60 
days allotted for his or her review, this subsequent inaction 
constitutes an affirmance allowing a provider an additional 60 days in 
which to file for judicial review, beginning with the date the 
Administrator's time expires for taking action under 
Sec. 405.1875(g)(2).
    (d) Matters not subject to judicial review. Certain matters 
affecting payments to hospital under the prospective payment system are 
not subject to

[[Page 103]]

judicial review, as provided in section 1886(d)(7) of the Act and 
Sec. 405.1804.
    (e) Group appeals. Any action under this section by providers that 
are under common ownership or control (see Sec. 413.17 of this chapter) 
must be brought by the providers as a group with respect to any matter 
involving an issue common to the providers.
    (f) Venue for appeals. An action for judicial review must be brought 
in the District Court of the United States for the judicial district in 
which the provider is located (or, effective April 20, 1983, in an 
action brought jointly by several providers, the judicial district in 
which the greatest number of such providers are located) or in the 
District Court for the District of Columbia. Effective April 20, 1983, 
any action for judicial review by providers under common ownership or 
control (Sec. 413.17 of this chapter), must be brought by such providers 
as a group with respect to any matter involving an issue common to the 
providers.
    (g) Service of process. Process must be served as described under 45 
CFR part 4.

<R05>
Sec. 405.1881  Appointment of representative.

    A provider or other party may be represented by legal counsel or any 
other person it appoints to act as its representative at the 
proceedings, conducted in accordance with Secs. 405.1819 and 405.1851.


<R05>
Sec. 405.1883  Authority of representative.

    A representative appointed by a provider or other party may accept 
or give on behalf of the provider or other party any request or notice

Sec. 405.2122  Types and duration of classification according to utilization rates.

    A renal transplantation center that meets all the other conditions 
for coverage of ESRD services will be classified according to its 
utilization rate(s) as follows: Unconditional status, conditional 
status, exception status, or not eligible for reimbursement for that 
ESRD service. Such classification will be based on previously reported 
utilization data (see Sec. 405.2124, except as specified in paragraph 
(a) of this section), and will be effective until notification of 
subsequent classification occurs. (See Sec. 405.2123 for reporting 
requirements; Sec. 405.2124 for method of calculating rates: 
Sec. 405.2130 for specific standards.)
    (a) Initial classification. (1) A renal transplantation center that 
has not previously participated in the ESRD program will be granted 
conditional status if it submits a written plan, detailing how it will 
achieve the utilization rates for conditional status by the end of the 
second calendar year of its operation under the ESRD program, and the 
rates required for unconditional status by the end of its fourth 
calendar year of operation.
    (2) The renal transplantation center's performance will be evaluated 
at the end of the first calendar year to ascertain whether it is 
properly implementing the plan.
    (b) Exception status. (1) A renal transplantation center that does 
not meet the minimum utilization rate for unconditional or conditional 
status may be approved by the Secretary for a time limited exception 
status if:
    (i) It meets all other conditions for coverage under this subpart;
    (ii) It is unable to meet the minimum utilization rate because it 
lacks a sufficient number of patients and is located in an area without 
a sufficient population base to support a center or facility which would 
meet the rate; and
    (iii) Its absence would adversely affect the achievement of ESRD 
program objectives.
    (2) A hospital that furnishes renal transplantation services 
primarily to pediatric patients and is approved as a renal dialysis 
center under this subpart, but does not meet the utilization standards 
prescribed in Sec. 405.2130(a), may be approved by the Secretary for a 
time limited exception status if:
    (i) It meets all other conditions for coverage as a renal 
transplantation center;
    (ii) The surgery is performed under the direct supervision of a 
qualified transplantation surgeon (Sec. 405.2102) who is also performing 
renal transplantation surgery at an approved renal transplantation 
center that is primarily oriented to adult nephrology;
    (iii) It has an agreement, with the other hospital serviced by the 
surgeon, for sharing limited resources that are needed for kidney 
transplantation; and
    (iv) There are pediatric patients who need the surgery and who 
cannot obtain it from any other hospital located within a reasonable 
distance.

<R05>
Sec. 405.2123  Reporting of utilization rates for classification.

    Each hospital furnishing renal transplantation services must submit 
an annual report to HCFA on its utilization rates. The report must 
include both the number of transplants performed during the most recent 
year of operation and the number performed during each of the preceding 
2 calendar years.

<R05>
Sec. 405.2124  Calculation of utilization rates for comparison with minimal utilization rate(s) and notification of status.

    For purposes of classification the Secretary will use either the 
utilization rate for the preceding 12 months or the average utilization 
rate of the preceding 2 calendar years, whichever is higher. The 
Secretary will inform each ESRD facility and the network coordinating 
council of the network area in which the ESRD facility is located of the 
results of this classification.


<R05>
Sec. 405.2130  Condition: Minimum utilization rates.

    Unless a renal transplantation center is granted an exception under 
Sec. 405.2122(b), the center must meet the following minimum utilization 
rate(s) for unconditional or conditional status:
    (a) Unconditional status: 15 or more transplants performed annually.
    (b) Conditional status: 7 to 14 transplants performed annually.

surveillance and reporting of infections, housekeeping, handling and 
disposal of waste and contaminants, and sterilization and disinfection, 
including the sterilization and maintenance of equipment where dialysis 
supplies are reused, there are written policies and procedures covering 
the rinsing, cleaning, disinfection, preparation and storage of reused 
items which conform to requirements for reuse in Sec. 405.2150.

[[Page 118]]

    (2) Treatment areas are designed and equipped to provide adequate 
and safe dialysis therapy, as well as privacy and comfort for patients. 
The space for treating each patient is sufficient to accomodate 
medically needed emergency equipment and staff and to ensure that such 
equipment and staff can reach the patient in an emergency. There is 
sufficient space in units for safe storage of self-dialysis supplies.
    (3) There is a nursing/monitoring station from which adequate 
surveillance of patients receiving dialysis services can be made.
    (4) Heating and ventilation systems are capable of maintaining 
adequate and comfortable temperatures.
    (5) Each ESRD facility utilizing a central-batch delivery system 
provides, either on the premises or through affiliation agreement or 
arrangement (see Sec. 405.2160) sufficient individual delivery systems 
for the treatment of any patient requiring special dialysis solutions.
    (c) Standard contamination prevention. The facility employs 
appropriate techniques to prevent cross-contamination between the unit 
and adjacent hospital or public areas including, but not limited to, 
food service areas, laundry, disposal of solid waste and blood-
contaminated equipment, and disposal of contaminants into sewage 
systems. Waste storage and disposal are carried out in accordance with 
applicable local laws and accepted public health procedures. The written 
patient care policies (see Sec. 405.2136(f)(1)) specify the functions 
that are carried out by facility personnel and by the self-dialysis 
patients with respect to contamination prevention. Where dialysis 
supplies are reused, records are maintained that can be used to 
determine whether established procedures covering the rinsing, cleaning, 
disinfection, preparation and storage of reused items, conform to 
requirements for reuse in Sec. 405.2150.
    (d) Standard: emergency preparedness. Written policies and 
procedures specifically define the handling of emergencies which may 
threaten the health or safety of patients. Such emergencies would exist 
during a fire or natural disaster or during functional failures in 
equipment. Specific emergency preparedness procedures exist for 
different kinds of emergencies. These are reviewed and tested at least 
annually and revised as necessary by, or under the direction of, the 
chief executive officer. All personnel are knowledgeable and trained in 
their respective roles in emergency situations.
    (1) There is an established written plan for dealing with fire and 
other emergencies which, when necessary, is developed in cooperation 
with fire and other expert personnel.
    (2) All personnel are trained, as part of their employment 
orientation, in all aspects of preparedness for any emergency or 
disaster. The emergency preparedness plan provides for orientation and 
regular training and periodic drills for all personnel in all procedures 
so that each person promptly and correctly carries out a specified role 
in case of an emergency.
    (3) There is available at all times on the premises a fully equipped 
emergency tray, including emergency drugs, medical supplies, and 
equipment, and staff are trained in its use.
    (4) The staff is familiar with the use of all dialysis equipment and 
procedures to handle medical emergencies.
    (5) Patients are trained to handle medical and nonmedical 
emergencies. Patients must be fully informed regarding what to do, where 
to go, and whom to contact if a medical or nonmedical emergency occurs.

Sec. 405.2150  Condition: Reuse of hemodialyzers and other dialysis supplies.

    An ESRD facility that reuses hemodialyzers and other dialysis 
supplies meets the requirements of this section. Failure to meet any of 
paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section constitutes grounds for 
denial of payment for the dialysis treatment affected and termination 
from participation in the Medicare program.
    (a) Standard: Hemodialyzers. If the ESRD facility reuses 
hemodialyzers, it conforms to the following:

[[Page 119]]

    (1) Reuse guidelines. Voluntary guidelines adopted by the AAMI 
(``Reuse of Hemodialyzers,'' second edition). Incorporation by reference 
of the AAMI's ``Reuse of Hemodialyzers,'' second edition, 1993, was 
approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 
U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.<SUP>1</SUP> If any changes in ``Reuse 
of Hemodialyzers,'' second edition, are also to be incorporated by 
reference, a notice to that effect will be published in the Federal 
Register.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The publication entitled ``Reuse of Hemodialyzers,'' second 
edition, 1993, is available for inspection at the HCFA Information 
Resources Center, 7500 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21244-1850 and 
the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., Suite 
700, Washington, DC. Copies may be purchased from the Association for 
the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation, 3300 Washington Boulevard, 
Suite 400, Arlington, VA 22201-4598.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Procedure for chemical germicides. To prevent any risk of 
dialyzer membrane leaks due to the combined action of different chemical 
germicides, dialyzers are exposed to only one chemical germicide during 
the reprocessing procedure. If a dialyzer is exposed to a second 
germicide, the dialyzer must be discarded.
    (3) Surveillance of patient reactions. In order to detect bacteremia 
and to maintain patient safety when unexplained events occur, the 
facility--
    (i) Takes appropriate blood cultures at the time of a febrile 
response in a patient; and
    (ii) If pyrogenic reactions, bacteremia, or unexplained reactions 
associated with ineffective reprocessing are identified, terminates 
reuse of hemodialyzers in that setting and does not continue reuse until 
the entire reprocessing system has been evaluated.
    (b) Standard: Transducer filters. To control the spread of 
hepatitis, transducer filters are changed after each dialysis treatment 
and are not reused.
    (c) Standard: Bloodlines. If the ESRD facility reuses bloodlines, it 
must--
    (1) Limit the reuse of bloodlines to the same patient;
    (2) Not reuse bloodlines labeled for ``single use only'';
    (3) Reuse only bloodlines for which the manufacturer's protocol for 
reuse has been accepted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
pursuant to the premarket notification (section 510(k)) provision of the 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; and
    (4) Follow the FDA-accepted manufacturer's protocol for reuse of 
that bloodline.

    Under the agreement, the Federally qualified health center must 
agree to the following:
    (a) Maintain compliance with the requirements. (1) The Federally 
qualified health center must agree to maintain compliance with the 
Federally qualified health center requirements set forth in this subpart

    (2) Centers must promptly report to HCFA any changes that result in 
noncompliance with any of these requirements.
    (b) Effective date of agreement. (1) Except as specified in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the effective date of the agreement is 
the date HCFA accepts the signed agreement, which assures that all 
Federal requirements are met.
    (2) For facilities that met all requirements on October 1, 1991, the 
effective date of the agreement can be October 1, 1991.
    (c) Charges to beneficiaries. (1) The beneficiary is responsible for 
payment of a coinsurance amount which is 20 percent of the amount of 
Part B payment made to the Federally qualified health center for the 
covered services. There is no coinsurance for a second or third opinion 
obtained in accordance

[[Page 131]]

with section 1164 of the Act or for pneumococcal vaccine and its 
administration.
    (2) The beneficiary is responsible for blood deductible expenses, as 
specified in Sec. 410.161.
    (3) The Federally qualified health center agrees not to charge the 
beneficiary (or any other person acting on behalf of a beneficiary) for 
any Federally qualified health center services for which the beneficiary 
is entitled to have payment made on his or her behalf by the Medicare 
program (or for which the beneficiary would have been entitled if the 
Federally qualified health center had filed a request for payment in 
accordance with Sec. 410.165 of this chapter), except for coinsurance 
amounts.
    (4) The Federally qualified health center may charge the beneficiary 
for items and services that are not Federally qualified health center 
services. However, if the item or service is covered under Part B of 
Medicare, and the Federally qualified health center agrees to receive 
Part B payment under the assignment method, the Federally qualified 
health center may not charge the beneficiary more than 20 percent of the 
Part B payment.
    (d) Refunds to beneficiaries. (1) The Federally qualified health 
center must agree to refund as promptly as possible any money 
incorrectly collected from Medicare beneficiaries or from someone on 
their behalf.
    (2) As used in this section, ``money incorrectly collected'' means 
any amount for covered services that is greater than the amount for 
which the beneficiary was liable because of the coinsurance requirements 
specified in part 410, subpart E.
    (3) Amounts also are considered incorrectly collected if the 
Federally qualified health center believed the beneficiary was not 
entitled to Medicare benefits but--
    (i) The beneficiary was later determined to have been so entitled;
    (ii) The beneficiary's entitlement period fell within the time the 
Federally qualified health center's agreement with HCFA was in effect; 
and
    (iii) The amounts exceed the beneficiary's coinsurance liability.
    (e) Treatment of beneficiaries. (1) The Federally qualified health 
center must agree to accept Medicare beneficiaries for care and 
treatment.
    (2) The Federally qualified health center may not impose any 
limitations with respect to care and treatment of Medicare beneficiaries 
that it does not also impose upon all other persons seeking care and 
treatment from the Federally qualified health center. Failure to comply 
with this requirement is a cause for termination of the Federally

center services to the community; or
    (ii) Otherwise interfere with the effective and efficient 
administration of the Medicare program.
    (3) The termination is effective at the end of the last day of

date of termination.


<R05>
Sec. 405.2440  Conditions for reinstatement after termination by HCFA.

    When HCFA has terminated an agreement with a Federally qualified 
health center, HCFA will not enter into another agreement with the 
Federally qualified health center to participate in the Medicare program

    (a) Finds that the reason for the termination no longer exists; and
    (b) Is assured that the reason for the termination of the prior 
agreement will not recur.


<R05>
Sec. 405.2442  Notice to the public.

    (2) Merger. The merger of the center corporation into another 
corporation, or the consolidation of two or more corporations, one of 
which is the center corporation, resulting in the creation of a new 
corporation, constitutes a change of ownership. (The merger of another 
corporation into the center corporation does not constitute change of 
ownership.)

Sec. 405.2460  Applicability of general payment exclusions.

    The payment conditions, limitations, and exclusions set out in 
subpart C of this part, part 410 and part 411 of this chapter are 
applicable to payment for services provided by rural health clinics and 
Federally qualified health centers, except that preventive primary 
services, as defined in Sec. 405.2448, are covered in Federally 
qualified health centers and not excluded by the provisions of section 
1862(a) of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 405.2462  Payment for rural health clinic and Federally qualified health center services.

    (a) Payment to provider-based rural health clinics and Federally 
qualified

[[Page 135]]

health centers. A rural health clinic or Federally qualified health 
center is paid in accordance with parts 405 and 413 of this subchapter, 
as applicable, if:
    (1) The clinic or center is an integral and subordinate part of a 
hospital, skilled nursing facility or home health agency participating 
in Medicare (i.e., a provider of services); and
    (2) The clinic or center is operated with other departments of the 
provider under common licensure, governance and professional 
supervision.
    (b) Payment to independent rural health clinics and freestanding 
Federally qualified health centers. (1) All other clinics and centers 
will be paid on the basis of an all-inclusive rate for each beneficiary 
visit for covered services. This rate will be determined by the 
intermediary, in accordance with this subpart and general instructions 
issued by HCFA.
    (2) The amount payable by the intermediary for a visit will be 
determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) and (4) of this section.
    (3) Federally qualified health centers. For Federally qualified 
health center visits, Medicare will pay 80 percent of the all-inclusive 
rate since no deductible is applicable to Federally qualified health 
center services.
    (4) Rural health clinics. (i) If the deductible has been fully met 
by the beneficiary prior to the rural health clinic visit, Medicare pays 
80 percent of the all-inclusive rate.
    (ii) If the deductible has not been fully met by the beneficiary 
before the visit, and the amount of the clinic's reasonable customary 
charge for the services that is applied to the deductible is--
    (A) Less than the all-inclusive rate, the amount applied to the 
deductible will be subtracted from the all-inclusive rate and 80 percent 
of the remainder, if any, will be paid to the clinic;
    (B) Equal to or exceeds the all-inclusive rate, no payment will be 
made to the clinic.
    (5) To receive payment, the clinic or center must follow the payment 
procedures specified in section 410.165 of this chapter.
    (6) Payment for treatment of mental psychoneurotic or personality 
disorders is subject to the limitations on payment in Sec. 410.155(c).


<R05>
Sec. 405.2463  What constitutes a visit.

    (a) Visit. (1) A visit is a face-to-face encounter between a clinic 
or center patient and a physician, physician assistant, nurse 
practitioner, nurse-midwife, or visiting nurse.
    (2) For FQHCs, a visit also means a face-to-face encounter between a 
patient and a qualified clinical psychologist or clinical social worker.
    (3) Encounters with more than one health professional and multiple 
encounters with the same health professional that take place on the same 
day and at a single location constitute a single visit, except when one 
of the following conditions exist:
    (i) After the first encounter, the patient suffers illness or injury 
requiring additional diagnosis or treatment.
    (ii) For FQHCs, the patient has a medical visit and an other health 
visit, as defined in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (4) Payment. (i) Medicare pays for two visits per day when the 
conditions in paragraph (a)(3) of this section are met.
    (ii) In all other cases, payment is limited to one visit per day.
    (b) Medical visit. For purposes of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, 
a medical visit is a face-to-face encounter between an FQHC patient and 
a physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, nurse-midwife, or 
visiting nurse.
    (c) Other health visit. For purposes of paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, an other health visit is a face-to-face encounter between an 
FQHC patient and a clinical psychologist, clinical social worker, or 
other health professional for mental health services.

[61 FR 14657, Apr. 3, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 405.2464  All-inclusive rate.

    (a) Determination of rate. (1) An all-inclusive rate is determined 
by the intermediary at the beginning of the reporting period.
    (2) The rate is determined by dividing the estimated total allowable 
costs by estimated total visits for rural health clinic or Federally 
qualified health center services.

[[Page 136]]

    (3) The rate determination is subject to any tests of reasonableness 
that may be established in accordance with this subpart.
    (b) Adjustment of rate. (1) The intermediary, during each reporting 
period, periodically reviews the rate to assure that payments 
approximate actual allowable costs and visits for rural health clinic or 
Federally qualified health center services and adjusts the rate if:
    (i) There is a significant change in the utilization of clinic or 
center services;
    (ii) Actual allowable costs vary materially from the clinic or 
center's allowable costs; or
    (iii) Other circumstances arise which warrant an adjustment.
    (2) The clinic or center may request the intermediary to review the 
rate to determine whether adjustment is required.


<R05>
Sec. 405.2466  Annual reconciliation.

    (a) General. Payments made to a rural health clinic or a Federally 
qualified health center during a reporting period are subject to 
reconciliation to assure that those payments do not exceed or fall short 
of the allowable costs attributable to covered services furnished to 
Medicare beneficiaries during that period.
    (b) Calculation of reconciliation. (1) The total reimbursement 
amount due the clinic or center for covered services furnished to 
Medicare beneficiaries is based on the report specified in 
Sec. 405.2470(c)(2) and is calculated by the intermediary as follows:
    (i) The average cost per visit is calculated by dividing the total 
allowable cost incurred for the reporting period by total visits for 
rural health clinic or Federally qualified health center services 
furnished during the period. The average cost per visit is subject to 
tests of reasonableness which may be established in accordance with this 
subpart.
    (ii) The total cost of rural health clinic or Federally qualified 
health center services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries is calculated 
by multiplying the average cost per visit by the number of visits for 
covered rural health clinic or Federally qualified health center 
services by beneficiaries.
    (iii) For rural health clinics, the total reimbursement due the 
clinic is 80 percent of the amount calculated by subtracting the amount 
of deductible incurred by beneficiaries that is attributable to rural 
health clinic services from the cost of these services. The 
reimbursement computation for Federally qualified health centers does 
not include a reduction related to the deductible because Federally 
qualified health center services are not subject to a deductible.
    (iv) For rural health clinics and FQHCs, payment for pneumococcal 
and influenza vaccine and their administration is 100 percent of 
Medicare reasonable cost.
    (2) The total reimbursement amount due is compared with total 
payments made to the clinic or center for the reporting period, and the 
difference constitutes the amount of the reconciliation.
    (c) Notice of program reimbursement. The intermediary sends written 
notice to the clinic or center:
    (1) Setting forth its determination of the total reimbursement 
amount due the clinic or center for the reporting period and the amount, 
if any, of the reconciliation; and
    (2) Informing the clinic or center of its right to have the 
determination reviewed at a hearing under the procedures set forth in 
subpart R of this part.
    (d) Payment of reconciliation amount--(1) Underpayments. If the 
total reimbursement due the clinic or center exceeds the payments made 
for the reporting period, the intermediary makes a lump-sum payment to 
the clinic or center to bring total payments into agreement with total 
reimbursement due the clinic or center.
    (2) Overpayments. If the total payments made to a clinic or center 
for the reporting period exceed the total reimbursement due the clinic 
or center for the period, the intermediary arranges with the clinic or 
center for repayment through a lump-sum refund, or, if that poses a 
hardship for the clinic or center, through offset against subsequent 
payments or a combination of offset and refund. The repayment

[[Page 137]]

must be completed as quickly as possible, generally within 12 months 
from the date of the notice of program reimbursement. A longer repayment 
period may be agreed to by the intermediary if the intermediary is 
satisfied that unusual circumstances exist which warrant a longer 
period.

<R05>
Sec. 405.2468  Allowable costs.

    (a) Applicability of general Medicare principles. In determining 
whether and to what extent a specific type or item of cost is allowable, 
such as interest, depreciation, bad debts and owner compensation, the 
intermediary applies the principles for reimbursement of provider costs, 
as set forth in part 413 of this subchapter.
    (b) Typical rural health clinic and Federally qualified health 
center costs. The following types and items of cost are included in 
allowable costs to the extent that they are covered and reasonable:
    (1) Compensation for the services of a physician, physician 
assistant, nurse practitioner, nurse-midwife, visiting nurse, qualified 
clinical psychologist, and clinical social worker who owns, is employed 
by, or furnishes services under contract to an FQHC. (RHCs are not paid 
for services furnished by contracted individuals other than physicians.)
    (2) Compensation for the duties that a supervising physician is 
required to perform under the agreement specified in Sec. 491.8 of this 
chapter.
    (3) Costs of services and supplies incident to the services of a 
physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, nurse-midwife, 
qualified clinical psychologist, or clinical social worker.
    (4) Overhead costs, including clinic or center administration, costs 
applicable to use and maintenance of the entity, and depreciation costs.
    (5) Costs of services purchased by the clinic or center.
    (c) Tests of reasonableness for rural health clinic cost and 
utilization. Tests of reasonableness authorized by sections 1833(a) and 
1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act may be established by HCFA or the carrier with 
respect to direct or indirect overall costs, costs of specific items and 
services, or costs of groups of items and services. Those tests include, 
but are not limited to, screening guidelines and payment limitations.
    (d) Screening guidelines. (1) Costs in excess of amounts established 
by the guidelines are not included unless the clinic or center provides 
reasonable justification satisfactory to the intermediary.
    (2) Screening guidelines are used to assess the costs of services, 
including the following:
    (i) Compensation for the professional and supervisory services of 
physicians and for the services of physician assistants, nurse 
practitioners, and nurse-midwives.
    (ii) Services of physicians, physician assistants, nurse 
practitioners, nurse-midwives, visiting nurses, qualified clinical 
psychologists, and clinical social workers.
    (iii) The level of administrative and general expenses.
    (iv) Staffing (for example, the ratio of other clinic or center 
personnel to physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners).
    (v) The reasonableness of payments for services purchased by the 
clinic or center, subject to the limitation that the costs of physician 
services purchased by the clinic or center may not exceed amounts 
determined under the applicable provisions of subpart E of part 405 or 
part 415 of this chapter.
    (e) Payment limitations. Limits on payments may be set by HCFA, on 
the basis of costs estimated to be reasonable for the provision of such 
services.

<R05>
Sec. 405.2470  Reports and maintenance of records.

    (a) Maintenance and availability of records. The rural health clinic 
or Federally qualified health center must:
    (1) Maintain adequate financial and statistical records, in the form 
and containing the data required by HCFA, to allow the intermediary to 
determine payment for covered services furnished to Medicare 
beneficiaries in accordance with this subpart;

[[Page 138]]

    (2) Make the records available for verification and audit by HHS or 
the General Accounting Office;
    (3) Maintain financial data on an accrual basis, unless it is part 
of a governmental institution that uses a cash basis of accounting. In 
the latter case, appropriate depreciation on capital assets is allowable 
rather than the expenditure for the capital asset.
    (b) Adequacy of records. (1) The intermediary may suspend 
reimbursement if it determines that the clinic or center does not 
maintain records that provide an adequate basis to determine payments 
under Medicare.
    (2) The suspension continues until the clinic or center demonstrates 
to the intermediary's satisfaction that it does, and will continue to, 
maintain adequate records.
    (c) Reporting requirements--(1) Initial report. At the beginning of 
its initial reporting period, the clinic or center must submit an 
estimate of budgeted costs and visits for rural health clinic or 
Federally qualified health center services for the reporting period, in 
the form and detail required by HCFA, and such other information as HCFA 
may require to establish the payment rate.
    (2) Annual reports. Within 90 days after the end of its reporting 
period, the clinic or center must submit, in such form and detail as may 
be required by HCFA, a report of:
    (i) Its operations, including the allowable costs actually incurred 
for the period and the actual number of visits for rural health clinic 
or Federally qualified health center services furnished during the 
period; and
    (ii) The estimated costs and visits for rural health clinic services 
or Federally qualified health center services for the succeeding 
reporting period and such other information as HCFA may require to 
establish the payment rate.
    (3) Late reports. If the clinic or center does not submit an 
adequate annual report on time, the intermediary may reduce or suspend 
payments to preclude excess payment to the clinic or center.
    (4) Inadequate reports. If the clinic or center does not furnish a 
report or furnishes a report that is inadequate for the intermediary to 
make a determination of program payment, HCFA may deem all payments for 
the reporting period to be overpayments.
    (5) Postponement of due date. For good cause shown by the clinic or 
center, the intermediary may, with HCFA's approval, grant a 30-day 
postponement of the due date for the annual report.
    (6) Reports following termination of agreement or change of 
ownership. The report from a clinic or center which voluntarily or 
involuntarily ceases to participate in the Medicare program or 
experiences a change in ownership (see Secs. 405.2436-405.2438) is due 
no later than 45 days following the effective date of the termination of 
agreement or change of ownership.


<R05>
Sec. 405.2472  Beneficiary appeals.

    A beneficiary may request a hearing by an intermediary (subject to 
the limitations and conditions set forth in subpart H of this part) if:
    (a) The beneficiary is dissatisfied with an intermediary's 
determination denying a request for payment made on his or her behalf by 
a rural health clinic or Federally qualified health center; or
    (b) The beneficiary is dissatisfied with the amount of payment; or
    (c) The beneficiary believes the request for payment is not being 
acted upon with reasonable promptness.

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 406.1  Statutory basis.

    Sections 226, 226A, 1818 and 1818A of the Social Security Act and 
section 103 of Public Law 89-97 establish the conditions for entitlement 
to hospital insurance benefits. Sections 202 (t) and (u) of the Act 
specify limitations that apply to certain aliens and to persons 
convicted of certain offenses.

as amended at 56 FR 38078, Aug. 12, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 406.2  Scope.

    Subparts A through D of this part specify the conditions of 
eligibility for hospital insurance and set forth certain specific 
conditions that affect entitlement to benefits. Hospital insurance is 
authorized under Part A of title XVIII and is also referred to as 
Medicare Part A. It includes inpatient hospital care, posthospital SNF 
care, home health services, and hospice care.

<R05>
Sec. 406.3  Definitions.

    First month of eligibility means the first month in which an 
individual meets all the requirements for entitlement to hospital 
insurance except application or enrollment if that is required.
    First month of entitlement means the first month for which the 
individual meets all the requirements for entitlement to Part A 
benefits.
    Insured individual means an individual who has the number of 
quarters of coverage required for monthly social security benefits.
    Quarter of coverage means a calendar quarter that is counted toward 
the number of covered quarters required to make the individual eligible 
for monthly social security benefits. A quarter is counted if during 
that quarter (or that calendar year) the individual earned a required 
minimum amount of money. (For details, see 20 CFR part 404, subpart B.)


<R05>
Sec. 406.5  Basis of eligibility and entitlement.

    (a) Hospital insurance without premiums. Hospital insurance is 
available to most individuals without payment of a premium if they:
    (1) Are age 65 or over, or
    (2) Have received social security or railroad retirement disability 
benefits for 25 months; or
    (3) Have end-stage renal disease. Subpart B of this part explains 
the requirements such individuals must meet to obtain hospital insurance 
without premiums.
    (b) Premium hospital insurance. Many individuals who are age 65 or 
over, but do not meet the requirements set forth in subpart B of this 
part, and certain individuals under age 65, may obtain

[[Page 140]]

the benefits by paying a premium. Section 406.20 of this part explains 
the requirements individuals must meet to obtain premium hospital 
insurance.

[48 FR 12536, Mar. 25, 1983, as amended at 50 FR 33033, Aug. 16, 1985; 
56 FR 38078, Aug. 12, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 406.6  Application or enrollment for hospital insurance.

    (a) Basic provision. In most cases, eligibility for Medicare Part A 
is a result of entitlement to monthly social security or railroad 
retirement cash benefits or eligibility for monthly social security cash 
benefits. This section specifies the individuals who need not file an 
application to become entitled to hospital insurance, those who must 
file an application, and those who must enroll.
    (b) Individuals who need not file an application for hospital 
insurance. An individual who meets any of the following conditions need 
not file an application for hospital insurance:
    (1) Is under age 65 and has been entitled, for more than 24 months, 
to monthly social security or railroad retirement benefits based on 
disability.
    (2) At the time of attainment of age 65, is entitled to monthly 
social security or railroad retirement benefits.
    (3) Establishes entitlement to monthly social security or railroad 
retirement benefits at any time after attaining age 65.
    (c) Individuals who must file an application for hospital insurance. 
An individual must file an application for hospital insurance if he or 
she seeks entitlement to hospital insurance on the basis of--
    (1) The transitional provisions set forth in Sec. 406.11;
    (2) Deemed entitlement to disabled widow's or widower's benefit 
under certain circumstances as provided in Sec. 406.12;
    (3) A diagnosis of end-stage renal disease, as specified in 
Sec. 406.13;
    (4) Effective January 1, 1981, eligibility for social security cash 
benefits, as specified in Sec. 406.10(a)(3), if the individual has 
attained age 65 without applying for those benefits; or
    (5) The special provisions applicable to government employment as 
set forth in Sec. 406.15.
    (d) When application is deemed to be filed. (1) An application based 
on the transitional provisions or on ESRD is deemed to be filed in the 
first month of eligibility if it is filed not more than 3 months before 
the first month, and is retroactive to that month if filed within 12 
months after the first month. An application filed more than 12 months 
after the first month of eligibility is retroactive to the 12th month 
before the month it is filed.
    (2) An application for deemed entitlement to disabled widow's or 
widower's benefits, that is filed before the first month in which the 
individual meets all conditions of entitlement for this benefit, will be 
deemed a valid application if those conditions are met before an initial 
determination, reconsideration, or hearing decision is made on the 
application. If the conditions are met after the date of any hearing 
decision, a new application will have to be filed. An application 
validly filed within 12 months after the first month of eligibility is 
retroactive to that first month. If filed more than 12 months after that 
first month, it is retroactive to the 12th month before the month of 
filing.
    (3) Effective June 8, 1980, an application based on eligibility for 
social security benefits at or after age 65, that is filed before the 
first month in which the individual meets all eligibility conditions for 
this benefit, will be deemed a valid application if those conditions are 
met before an initial determination, reconsideration, or hearing 
decision is made on the application. If the conditions are met after the 
date of any hearing decision, a new application will have to be filed.
    (4) Effective March 1, 1981, an application under Sec. 406.10 that 
is validly filed within 6 months after the first month of eligibility is 
retroactive to that first month. If filed more than 6 months after that 
first month, it is retroactive to the 6th month before the month of 
filing.
    (e) Individuals who must enroll for hospital insurance. An 
individual who must pay a monthly premium for hospital

[[Page 141]]

insurance must enroll in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
Sec. 406.21.

<R05>
Sec. 406.7  Forms to apply for entitlement under Medicare Part A.

    The following forms, available free of charge by mail from HCFA or 
at any Social Security branch or district office, are used to apply for 
Medicare entitlement under the circumstances indicated:

    HCFA-18-F-5--Application for Hospital Insurance Entitlement. (For

[53 FR 6633, Mar. 2, 1988]


<R04>
         Subpart B--Hospital Insurance Without Monthly Premiums


<R05>
Sec. 406.10  Individual age 65 or over who is entitled to social security or railroad retirement benefits, or who is eligible for social security benefits.

    (a) Requirements. An individual is entitled to hospital insurance 
benefits under section 226 of the Act if he or she has attained aged 65 
and is:
    (1) Entitled to monthly social security benefits under section 202 
of the Social Security Act;
    (2) A qualified railroad retirement beneficiary who has been 
certified as such to the Social Security Administration by the Railroad 
Retirement Board in accordance with section 7(d) of the Railroad 
Retirement Act of 1974; or
    (3) Effective January 1, 1981, eligible for monthly social security 
benefits under section 202 of the Act and has filed an application for 
hospital insurance.
    (b) Beginning and end of entitlement. (1) Entitlement begins with 
the first day of the first month in which the individual meets the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) Entitlement continues until the individual dies or no longer 
meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. An individual 
is not entitled to railroad retirement benefits and is neither entitled 
to, nor eligible for, monthly social security benefits in the month in 
which he or she dies. However, an individual who meets all other 
requirements for hospital insurance entitlement is entitled to hospital 
insurance in the month in which he or she dies if he or she--
    (i) Would have been entitled to monthly railroad retirement benefits 
or social security benefits in that month if he or she had not died; or
    (ii) Has filed an application for hospital insurance and would have 
been eligible for monthly social security benefits in that month if he 
or she had not died.


<R05>
Sec. 406.11  Individual age 65 or over who is not eligible as a social security or railroad retirement benefits beneficiary, or on the basis of government 
          employment.

    (a) Basis. Section 103 of the law that established the Medicare 
program in 1965 (Pub. L. 89-97) provided for eligibility for certain 
individuals who were age 65 or would soon attain age 65 but would not be 
able to qualify for social security or railroad retirement benefits.
    (b) Requirements. Unless he or she is excluded under paragraph (c) 
of this section, an individual age 65 or over who does not meet the 
requirements of Sec. 406.10 or Sec. 406.15 (and who would not meet those 
requirements if he or she filed an application), is entitled to Medicare 
Part A benefits if he or she meets the following requirements:
    (1) Age and quarters of coverage. (i) He or she attained age 65 
before 1968; or
    (ii) If he or she attained age 65 in 1968 or later, he or she must 
have at least 3 quarters of coverage for each year that elapsed after 
1966 and before the year in which he or she attained age 65. (The

[[Page 142]]

quarters of coverage may have been acquired at any time, not necessarily 
during the elapsed years.)
    (2) Residence and citizenship. He or she is a resident of the United 
States and--
    (i) A citizen of the United States; or
    (ii) An alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence who has 
continuously resided in the United States for 5 years immediately 
preceding the first month in which he or she meets all other 
requirements for entitlement to hospital insurance.
    (3) Application. He or she has filed an application for Medicare 
Part A no earlier than the third month before the first month of 
eligibility.
    (c) Bases for exclusion. An individual who meets the requirements of 
paragraph (b) of this section is excluded from Medicare Part A if he or 
she--
    (1) Has been convicted of spying, sabotage, or treason, sedition, 
and subversive action under chapter 37, 105, or 115 of title 18 of the 
United States Code;
    (2) Has been convicted of conspiracy to establish a dictatorship 
under section 4 of the Internal Security Act of 1950;
    (3) On February 16, 1965, was or could have been covered under the 
Federal Employees Health Benefits Act (FEHBA) of 1959; or
    (4) In his or her first month of eligibility;
    (i) Is covered by an enrollment under the FEHBA; or
    (ii) Could have been covered by an enrollment under that Act if he 
or she (or any other person who could provide him or her with coverage) 
was a Federal employee at any time after February 15, 1965, and had 
enrolled and retained coverage under that Act.
    (d) End of exclusion. An individual excluded under paragraph (c)(3) 
or (4) of this section can become entitled beginning with the first 
month in which he or she loses the right to FEHBA coverage solely 
because he or she or the other person leaves Federal employment.
    (e) Beginning and end of entitlement. (1) Entitlement begins--
    (i) In the first month of eligibility if the application is filed no 
later than 12 months after the first month of eligibility:
    (ii) In the 12th month before the month of application if the 
application is filed more than 12 months after the first month of 
eligibility.
    (2) Entitlement continues until death or until the month before the 
month in which the individual becomes entitled under Sec. 406.10 or 
Sec. 406.15.

[48 FR 12536, Mar. 25, 1983, as amended at 50 FR 33033, Aug. 16, 1985; 
53 FR 47202, Nov. 22, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 406.12  Individual under age 65 who is entitled to social security or railroad retirement disability benefits.

    (a) Basic requirements. An individual under age 65 is entitled to 
hospital insurance benefits if, for 25 months, he or she has been--
    (1) Entitled or deemed entitled to social security disability 
benefits as an insured individual, child, widow, or widower who is 
``under a disability'' or
    (2) A disabled qualified beneficiary certified under Section 7(d) of 
the Railroad Retirement Act.
    (b) Previous periods of disability benefits entitlement. Months of a 
previous period of entitlement or deemed entitlement to disability 
benefits count toward the 25-month requirement if any of the following 
conditions is met:
    (1) Entitlement was as an insured individual or a disabled qualified 
railroad retirement beneficiary, and the previous period ended within 
the 60 months preceding the month in which the current disability began.
    (2) Entitlement was as a disabled child, widow, or widower, and the 
previous period ended within the 84 months preceding the month in which 
the current disability began.
    (3) The previous period ended on or after March 1, 1988 and the 
current impairment is the same as, or directly related to, the 
impairment on which the previous period of entitlement was based.
    (c) Deemed entitlement to disabled widow's or widower's monthly 
benefits.
    (1) Purpose. The provisions of paragraphs (c) (2), (3), and (4) of 
this section are intended to enable individuals--
    (i) To meet the 25-month requirement of paragraph (a) of this 
section; or
    (ii) To retain hospital insurance entitlement when they are no 
longer entitled to monthly disability benefits.

[[Page 143]]

    (2) Deemed entitlement for certain individuals entitled to old-age 
insurance benefits. An individual who becomes entitled to monthly old-
age insurance benefits before age 65, is, by law, precluded from 
establishing or retaining entitlement to disabled widow's or widower's 
monthly benefits. However, for purposes of meeting the 25-month 
requirement, a widow or widower who meets all other requirements for 
disability benefits and is excluded solely because of entitlement to 
old-age insurance benefits, shall be deemed to be (or to continue to be) 
entitled to disability benefits. A widow or widower who is not entitled 
to disability benefits for the month before attaining age 60 must file 
two applications, one for old-age insurance benefits and one for 
hospital insurance.
    (3) Deemed entitlement for certain individuals entitled to mother's 
benefits. An individual entitled to mother's insurance benefits under 
section 202(g) of the Social Security Act cannot at the same time be 
entitled to disabled widow's benefits. However, if she applies for 
hospital insurance, she will be deemed to be entitled to disabled 
widow's monthly benefits in the first month (of the 12 months before 
application) in which she would have been entitled to those benefits if 
she had filed an application for them.
    (4) Deemed entitlement for certain individuals entitled to father's 
benefits. An individual who is entitled to father's insurance benefits 
under section 202(g) of the Act cannot at the same time be entitled to 
disabled widower's benefits. However, if he applies for hospital 
insurance benefits, he will be deemed to be entitled to disabled 
widower's monthly benefits as follows:
    (i) If he applied for hospital insurance benefits before May 1984, 
he was deemed entitled to disabled widower's benefits for any month 
after April 1981 for which he would have been entitled to those benefits 
if he had filed an application for them.
    (ii) If he applies for hospital insurance benefits in or after May 
1984, he is deemed entitled to disabled widower's benefits for any 
month, up to 12 months before the month of application, for which he 
would have been entitled to those benefits if he had filed an 
application for them.
    (iii) Hospital insurance entitlement under this paragraph (c)(4) 
could not begin before May 1983.
    (5) Deemed retroactive entitlement for certain disabled widows and 
widowers. In some cases, disabled widows or widowers cannot become 
entitled to monthly cash benefits before the month in which they file 
application. However, for purposes of meeting the 25-month requirement, 
disability benefit entitlement will be deemed to have begun with the 
earliest month (of the 12 months before the application for cash 
benefits) in which the individual met all the requirements except the 
filing of an application. (This provision is effective for applications 
filed on or after January 1, 1978.)
    (d) When entitlement begins and ends. (1) Entitlement to hospital 
insurance begins with the 25th month of an individual's entitlement or 
deemed entitlement to disability benefits. Although an individual is not 
entitled to disability benefits for the month in which he or she dies, 
for purposes of this paragraph the individual will be deemed to be 
entitled for the month of death.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, entitlement 
to hospital insurance ends with the earliest of the following:
    (i) The last day of the last month in which he or she was entitled 
or deemed entitled to disability benefits or was qualified as a disabled 
railroad retirement beneficiary, if he or she was notified of the 
termination of entitlement before that month.
    (ii) The last day of the month following the month in which he or 
she is mailed a notice that his or her entitlement or deemed entitlement 
to disability benefits, or his or her status as a qualified disabled 
railroad retirement beneficiary, has ended.
    (iii) The last day of the month before the month he or she attains 
age 65. (An individual who is entitled to social security or railroad 
retirement cash benefits for the month of attainment of age 65 is 
automatically entitled to hospital insurance under Sec. 406.10.)
    (iv) The day of death.
    (e) Continuation of Medicare entitlement when disability benefit 
entitlement

[[Page 144]]

ends because of substantial gainful activity (SGA)--(1) Definitions. As 
used in this section--
    Trial work period means the 9-month period provided under title II 
of the Act and as defined 20 CFR 404.1592, during which the individual 
may test his or her ability to work and still receive disability cash 
benefits; and
    Reentitlement period means a period as defined in 20 CFR 404.1592a 
that begins with the first month after the trial work period and ends 
with the 36th month after the trial work period or, if earlier, with the 
first month in which the impairment no longer exists or is no longer 
disabling. (During the reentitlement period, benefits may be 
discontinued because of SGA. However, if SGA is later discontinued, 
benefits may be reinstated without a new application and a new 
disability determination.)
    (2) Duration of continued Medicare entitlement. Effective January 1, 
1988, if an individual's entitlement to disability benefits or status as 
a qualified disabled railroad retirement beneficiary ends because he or 
she engaged in, or demonstrated the ability to engage in, substantial 
gainful activity after the 36 months following the end of the trial work 
period, Medicare entitlement continues until the earlier of the 
following:
    (i) The last day of the 24th month following the first month of SGA 
occurring after the 15th month of the individual's reentitlement period 
or, if later, the end of the month following the month the individual's 
disability benefit entitlement ends.
    (ii) The last day of the month following the month in which notice 
is mailed to the individual indicating that he or she is no longer 
entitled to hospital insurance because of an event or circumstance (for 
example, there has been medical improvement, or the disabled widow has 
remarried) that would terminate disability benefit entitlement if it had 
not already been terminated because of substantial gainful activity.

child's monthly social security benefits or to wife's, husband's, 
widow's, widower's, mother's or father's monthly benefits, as set forth 
in 20 CFR part 404. However, the duration of relationship requirements 
apply only to divorced spouses. (See 20 CFR 404.331.)
    Dependent child means a person who, on the first day he or she has

    (2) Is under a disability that began before age 22; or
    (3) Is under age 26, is receiving at least one-half support from 
that parent, and has continuously received at least one-half support 
from that parent since the day before attaining age 22.
    One-half support means regular contributions, in cash or in kind, 
that equals or exceeds one-half of the child's total support.
    (c) Requirements. An individual is entitled to hospital insurance 
benefits if--
    (1) He or she is medically determined to have ESRD;
    (2) He or she is:
    (i) Fully or currently insured under the social security program 
(title II of the Act) or would be fully or currently insured if his or 
her employment (after

``employment'' under the Social Security Act;
    (ii) Entitled to monthly social security or railroad retirement

paragraph (e) of this section.
    (d) Filing an application. (1) An individual may obtain an 
application form, and help in completing it, from any social security 
office.
    (2) An application is not valid if it is filed earlier than the 
third month before the month in which the individual meets the 
conditions of paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(4) of this section.
    (3) If an individual who has ESRD dies before he or she has filed an 
application, or is unable to file because of physical or mental 
condition, a relative or other person responsible for his or her affairs 
may file in his or her behalf. If a responsible person is not available, 
the hospital or dialysis facility that furnished treatment may file the 
application.
    (e) Beginning of entitlement--(1) Basic limitations. Entitlement can 
begin no earlier than the first month in which the individual meets the 
conditions specified in paragraph (c) of this section, or the 12th month 
before the month of application, whichever is later.
    (2) Waiting period. Entitlement begins on the first day of the third 
month after the month in which the individual initiates a regular course 
of renal dialysis, if the course is maintained throughout the waiting 
period, unless entitlement would begin earlier under paragraph (e) (3) 
or (4) of this section. This means that if dialysis began in January, 
entitlement would begin April 1.
    (3) Exceptions: Early kidney transplant. If the individual receives 
a transplant, entitlement begins with the first day of the month in 
which the transplant was performed. However, if the individual is 
admitted as an inpatient to a hospital that is an approved renal 
transplantation center or renal dialysis center (see Sec. 405.2102) for 
procedures preliminary to transplant surgery, entitlement begins--
    (i) On the first day of the month in which he or she initially 
enters the hospital, if the transplant is performed in that month or in 
either of the next 2 months; or
    (ii) On the first day of the second month before the month of kidney 
transplantation, if the transplant is delayed more than 2 months after 
the month of initial hospital stay.

For example, if an individual enters the hospital in January, and the 
transplant is performed in January, February, or March, entitlement 
would begin January 1. However, if the transplant is performed in April, 
entitlement would begin February 1.
    (4) Exceptions: Self-dialysis training. Entitlement begins on the 
first day of the month in which a regular course of renal dialysis began 
if:
    (i) Before the end of the waiting period, the individual 
participates in a self-dialysis training program offered by a 
participating Medicare facility that is approved to provide such 
training;
    (ii) The patient's physician has certified that it is reasonable to 
expect the individual will complete the training program and will self-
dialyze on a regular basis; and
    (iii) The regular course of dialysis is maintained throughout the 
time that would otherwise be the waiting period (unless it is terminated 
earlier because the individual dies).
    (f) End of entitlement. Entitlement ends with----
    (1) The end of the 12th month after the month in which a regular 
course of dialysis ends; or
    (2) The end of the 36th month after the month in which the 
individual has received a kidney transplant.
    (g) Resumption of entitlement. Entitlement is resumed under the 
following conditions:
    (1) An individual who initiates a regular course of renal dialysis 
or has a kidney transplant during the 12-month period after the previous 
course of dialysis ended is entitled to Part A benefits and eligible to 
enroll in Part B with the month the regular course of

[[Page 146]]

dialysis is resumed or the month the kidney is transplanted.
    (2) An individual who initiates a regular course of renal dialysis 
or has a kidney transplant during the 36-month period after an earlier 
kidney transplant is entitled to Part A benefits and eligible to enroll 
in Part B with the month the regular course of dialysis begins or with 
the month the subsequent kidney transplant occurs.
    (3) An individual who initiates a regular course of renal dialysis 
more than 12 months after the previous course of regular dialysis ended 
or more than 36 months after the month of a kidney transplant is 
eligible to enroll in Part A and Part B with the month in which the 
regular course of dialysis is resumed. If he or she is otherwise 
entitled under the conditions specified in paragraph (c) of this 
section, including the filing of an application, entitlement begins with 
the month in which dialysis is initiated or resumed, without a waiting 
period, subject to the limitations of paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 406.15  Special provisions applicable to Medicare qualified government employment.

    (a) Definition. As used in this section, Medicare-qualified 
government employment means Federal, State, or local government 
employment that is subject only to the hospital insurance portion of the 
tax imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (F.I.C.A.). This 
includes--
    (1) Wages paid for Federal employment after December 1982.
    (2) Wages paid to State and local government employees hired after 
March 31, 1986.
    (3) Wages paid to State and local government employees hired before 
April 1, 1986 but whose employment after March 31, 1986 is covered, for 
Medicare purposes only, under an agreement under section 218 of the Act.
    (b) Crediting of wages that are taxable only for Medicare purposes. 
Medicare qualified government employment is credited in the same way and 
in the same amount as social security covered employment is credited for 
monthly social security cash benefit purposes. However, since only the 
Medicare portion (not the social security portion) of the F.I.C.A. tax 
is imposed, Medicare qualified government employment does not help 
qualify the individual for monthly Social Security cash benefits.
    (c) Required quarters of coverage. (1) To qualify for hospital 
insurance on the basis of Medicare qualified government employment, an 
individual must have the number of quarters of coverage necessary to 
qualify for hospital insurance under Sec. 406.10, Sec. 406.12, or 
Sec. 406.13.
    (2) An individual who has worked in Medicare qualified government 
employment may qualify for hospital insurance on the basis of Medicare 
qualified government employment exclusively, or a combination of 
Medicare qualified government employment and social security covered 
employment.
    (d) Transitional provision for Federal employment. Any individual 
who was a Federal employee at any time both during and before January 
1983 will receive credit for quarters of Federal employment before 
January 1983 without paying tax. This transitional provision applies 
even if the Federal employee did not receive Federal wages for January 
1983, for instance, because he or she was on approved leave without pay 
or on loan to a State or foreign agency.
    (e) Conditions of entitlement. An individual who has worked in 
Medicare qualified government employment (or any related individual who 
would be entitled to social security cash benefits on the employee's 
record if Medicare qualified government employment qualified for those 
benefits) is entitled to hospital insurance benefits if he or she--
    (1) Would meet the requirements of Sec. 406.10, Sec. 406.12, or 
Sec. 406.13 if Medicare qualified government employment were social 
security covered employment; and
    (2) Has filed an application for hospital insurance.

For purposes of this section not more than 12 months before the month of 
application may be counted towards the 25-month qualifying period 
specified in Sec. 406.12(a).

[[Page 147]]

    (f) Beginning and end of entitlement--(1) Basic rule. Subject to the 
limitations specified in paragraph (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section, 
entitlement begins and ends as specified in Sec. 406.10, Sec. 406.12 or 
Sec. 406.13, whichever is used to establish hospital insurance 
entitlement for the Federal, State, or local government employee or 
related individual.
    (2) Limitations: Federal government employment. (i) Hospital 
insurance entitlement based on Federal employment could not begin before 
January 1983.
    (ii) No months before January 1983 may be used to satisfy the 
qualifying period required for entitlement based on disability.
    (3) Limitations: State and local government employment. (i) Hospital 
insurance entitlement based on State or local government employment 
cannot begin before April 1986.
    (ii) No months before April 1986 may be used to satisfy the 
qualifying period required for entitlement based on disability.

                  Subpart C--Premium Hospital Insurance


<R05>
Sec. 406.20  Basic requirements.

    (a) General provisions. Hospital insurance benefits are available to 
most individuals age 65 or over and to certain individuals under age 65 
who do not qualify for those benefits under subpart B of this part and 
are willing to pay a monthly premium. This is called premium hospital 
insurance.
    (b) Eligibility of individuals age 65 or over to enroll for premium 
hospital insurance. Any individual is eligible to enroll for Medicare 
Part A if he or she--
    (1) Has attained age 65;
    (2) Is a resident of the United States and is either--
    (i) A citizen of the United States; or
    (ii) An alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence who has 
resided in the United States continuously for the 5-year period 
immediately preceding the month in which he or she meets all other 
requirements;
    (3) Is not eligible for Part A benefits under subpart B of this 
part; and
    (4) Is entitled to supplementary medical insurance (Part B of 
Medicare) or is eligible and has enrolled for it during an enrollment 
period.
    (c) Eligibility of individuals under age 65 to enroll for premium 
hospital insurance. An individual who has not attained age 65 is 
eligible to enroll for Medicare Part A if he or she meets the following 
conditions:
    (1) Has been entitled to Medicare Part A (under Sec. 406.12 or 
Sec. 406.15) on the basis of entitlement or deemed entitlement to social 
security disability benefits, as provided under section 226(b) of the 
Act.
    (2) Continues to have a disabling physical or mental impairment.
    (3) Loses entitlement to disability benefits (and therefore also 
loses entitlement to Medicare Part A under Sec. 406.12) solely because 
his or her earnings exceed the amount allowed under the social security 
regulations pertaining to ``substantial gainful activity'' (20 CFR 
404.1571-404.1574); and
    (4) Is not otherwise entitled to Medicare Part A.

<R05>
Sec. 406.21  Individual enrollment.

    (a) Basic provision. An individual who meets the requirements of 
Sec. 406.20 (b) or (c) may enroll for premium hospital insurance only 
during his or her ``initial enrollment period'', a ``general enrollment 
period'', a ``special enrollment period'', or, for HMO/CMP enrollees, a 
``transfer enrollment period'', as set forth in paragraphs (b) through 
(f) of this section.
    (b) Initial enrollment periods--(1) Initial enrollment period for 
individual age 65 or over. The initial enrollment period extends for 7 
months, from the third month before the month the individual first meets 
the requirements of Sec. 406.20 (b)(1) through (b)(3) through the third 
month after that first month of eligibility.
    (2) Initial enrollment period of individual under age 65. The 
initial enrollment period begins with the month in which the individual 
receives notice that entitlement to Medicare Part A will end because he 
or she has lost entitlement to disability benefits solely because of

[[Page 148]]

earnings in excess of the amounts allowed under the social security 
regulations on substantial gainful activity (20 CFR 404.1571-404.1574). 
It continues for 7 full months after that month.
    (c) General enrollment period. (1) Except as specified in paragraph 
(c)(4) of this section, the general enrollment period extends from 
January 1 to March 31 of each calendar year.
    (2) General enrollment periods are for individuals who do not enroll 
during the special enrollment period, who failed to enroll during the 
initial enrollment period, or whose previous period of entitlement had 
terminated.
    (3) If the individual enrolls or reenrolls during a general 
enrollment period, his or her entitlement begins on July 1 of the 
calendar year.
    (4) During the period April 1 through September 30, 1981, the 
general enrollment period was any time after the end of the individual's 
initial enrollment period. Any eligible individual whose initial 
enrollment period has ended, or whose previous period of entitlement had 
terminated, could enroll or reenroll during that 6-month period.
    (d) ``Deemed'' initial enrollment period for individual age 65 or 
over. (1) If an individual who has attained age 65 fails to enroll 
during the initial enrollment period because of reliance on incorrect 
documentary information which led him or her to believe that he or she 
was not yet age 65, an initial enrollment period may be established for 
him or her as though he or she had attained age 65 on the date indicated 
by the incorrect documentary information.
    (2) The deemed initial enrollment period will be used to determine 
the individual's premium and right to enroll in a general enrollment 
period if such use is advantageous to the individual.
    (e)  [Reserved]
    (f) Transfer enrollment period for HMO/CMP enrollees. (1) 
Terminology. HMO or CMP means an eligible organization as defined in 
Sec. 417.401 which has a contract with HCFA under part 417, subpart L of 
this chapter.
    (2) Basic rule. Effective February 1, 1991, individuals enrolled in 
an HMO or CMP under part 417, subpart K of this chapter who meet the 
requirements of Sec. 406.20(b) may enroll in premium hospital insurance 
during a transfer enrollment period. This transfer enrollment period 
begins with any month or any part of a month in which the individual is 
enrolled in an HMO or CMP and ends with the last day of the 8th 
consecutive month in which the individual is no longer enrolled in the 
HMO or CMP.
    (3) Effective date of coverage. (i) If the individual enrolls in 
premium hospital insurance while still enrolled in an HMO or CMP, or 
during the first month that he or she is no longer enrolled in the HMO 
or CMP, part A coverage will begin on the first day of the month of part 
A enrollment, or, at the option of the individual, on the first day of 
any of the following 3 months.
    (ii) If the individual enrolls in premium hospital insurance during 
any of the last 7 months of the transfer enrollment period, coverage 
will begin on the first day of the month after the month of enrollment.

    (a) Individual age 65 or over. For an individual who has attained 
age 65, the following rules apply:
    (1) If the individual enrolls during the 3 months before the first 
month of eligibility, entitlement begins with the first month of 
eligibility.
    (2) If the individual enrolls in the first month of eligibility, 
entitlement begins with the following month.
    (3) If the individual enrolls during the month after the first month 
of eligibility, entitlement begins with the second month after the month 
of enrollment.

enrollment period, entitlement begins with the third month after the 
month of enrollment.
    (b) Individual under age 65. For an individual who has not attained 
age 65, the following rules apply:

[[Page 149]]

begins with the month in which the individual meets those requirements.
    (2) If the individual enrolls in the month in which he or she first 
meets the requirements of Sec. 406.20(c), entitlement begins with the 
following month.
    (3) If the individual enrolls in the month following the month in 
which he or she meets the requirements of Sec. 406.20(c), entitlement 
begins with the second month after the month of enrollment.
    (4) If the individual enrolls more than one month after the month in 
which he or she first meets the requirements of Sec. 406.20(c), 
entitlement begins with the third month after the month of enrollment.

Sec. 406.24  Special enrollment period.<SUP>1</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Before August 1986, SEPs were available only for enrollment in 
supplementary medical insurance, not for enrollment in premium hospital 
insurance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (a) Terminology. As used in this subpart, the following terms have 
the indicated meanings.
    (1) Current employment status has the meaning given this term in 
Sec. 411.104 of this chapter.
    (2) Family member has the meaning given this term in Sec. 411.201 of 
this chapter.
    (3) Group health plan (GHP) and large group health plan (LGHP) have 
the meanings given those terms in Sec. 411.101 of this chapter, except 
that the ``former employee'' language of those definitions does not 
apply with respect to SEPs because--
    (i) Section 1837(i)(1)(A) of the Act explicitly requires that GHP 
coverage of an individual age 65 or older, be by reason of the 
individual's (or the individual's spouse's) current employment status; 
and
    (ii) The sentence following section 1837(i)(1)(B), of the Act refers 
to ``large group health plan''. Under section 1862(b)(1)(B)(i), as 
amended by OBRA '93, LGHP coverage of a disabled individual must be ``by 
virtue of the individual's or a family member's current employment 
status with an employer''.
    (4) Special enrollment period (SEP) is a period provided by statute 
to enable certain individuals to enroll in Medicare without having to 
wait for the general enrollment period.
    (b) Duration of SEP.<SUP>2</SUP> (1) The SEP includes any month 
during any part of which--
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Before March 1995, SEPs began on the first day of the first 
month the individual was no longer covered under a GHP or LGHP by reason 
of current employment status.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) An individual over age 65 is enrolled in a GHP by reason of the 
current employment status of the individual or the individual's spouse; 
or
    (ii) An individual under age 65 and disabled--
    (A) Is enrolled in a GHP by reason of the current employment status 
of the individual or the individual's spouse; or
    (B) Is enrolled in an LGHP by reason of the current employment 
status of the individual or a member of the individual's family.
    (2) The SEP ends on the last day of the eighth consecutive month 
during which the individual is at no time enrolled in a GHP or an LGHP 
by reason of current employment status.
    (c) Conditions for use of a SEP.<SUP>3</SUP> In order to use a SEP, 
the individual must meet the following conditions:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Before August 10, 1993, an individual under age 65 could qualify 
for a SEP only if he or she had LGHP coverage as an ``active 
individual'', which the statute defined as ``an employee, employer, 
self-employed individual (such as the employer), individual associated 
with the employer in a business relationship, or as a member of the 
family of any of those persons''.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) When first eligible to enroll for premium hospital insurance 
under Sec. 406.20(b) or (c), the individual was--
    (i) Age 65 or over and covered under a GHP by reason of the current 
employment status of the individual or the individual's spouse;
    (ii) Under age 65 and covered under an LGHP by reason of the current 
employment status of the individual or a member of the individual's 
family ; or
    (iii) Under age 65 and covered under a GHP by reason of the current 
employment status of the individual or the individual's spouse.
    (2) For all the months thereafter, the individual has maintained 
coverage either under hospital insurance or a GHP or LGHP.

[[Page 150]]

    (d) Special rule: Additional SEPs. (1) Generally, if an individual 
fails to enroll during any available SEP, he or she is not entitled to 
any additional SEPs.
    (2) However, if an individual fails to enroll during a SEP, because 
coverage under the same or a different GHP or LGHP was restored before 
the end of that particular SEP, that failure to enroll does not preclude 
additional SEPs.
    (e) Effective date of coverage. (1) If the individual enrolls in a 
month during any part of which he or she is covered under a GHP or LGHP 
on the basis of current employment status, or in the first full month 
when no longer so covered, coverage begins on the first day of the month 
of enrollment or, at the individual's option, on the first day of any of 
the three following months.
    (2) If the individual enrolls in any month of the SEP other than the 
months specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, coverage begins on 
the first day of the month following the month of enrollment.

Sec. 406.26  Enrollment under State buy-in.

    (a) Enrollment of QMBs under a State buy-in agreement--(1) Effective 
date. Beginning with calendar year 1990, a State may request and be 
granted a modification of its buy-in agreement to include enrollment and 
payment of Part A premiums for QMBs (as defined in section 1905(p)(1) of 
the Act) who can become entitled to Medicare Part A only by paying a 
premium.
    (2) Amount of premium. Premiums paid under State buy-in are not 
subject to increase because of late enrollment or reenrollment.
    (b) Beginning of coverage under buy-in. The coverage period begins 
with the latest of the following:
    (1) The third month following the month in which the agreement 
modification covering QMBs is effectuated.
    (2) The first month in which the individual is entitled to premium 
hospital insurance under Sec. 406.20(b) and has QMB status.
    (3) The date specified in the agreement modification.
    (c) End of coverage under buy-in. Buy-in coverage ends with the 
earlier of the following:
    (1) Death. Coverage ends on the last day of the month in which the 
QMB dies.
    (2) Loss of QMB status. If the individual loses eligibility for QMB 
status, coverage ends on the last day of the month in which HCFA 
receives the State's notice of ineligibility.
    (3) Termination of buy-in agreement. If the State's buy-in agreement 
is terminated, coverage ends on the last day of the last month for which 
the agreement is in effect.
    (4) Entitlement to premium-free Part A. If the individual becomes 
entitled to premium-free Part A, buy-in coverage ends on the last day of 
entitlement to premium Part A.
    (d) Continuation of coverage: Individual enrollment following 
termination of buy-in coverage--(1) Deemed enrollment. If coverage under 
a buy-in agreement ends because the agreement is terminated or the 
individual loses QMB status, the individual--
    (i) Is considered to have enrolled during his or her initial 
enrollment period; and
    (ii) Is entitled to Part A benefits and liable for Part A premiums 
beginning with the first month for which he or she is no longer covered 
under the buy-in agreement.
    (2) Voluntary termination. (i) An individual may voluntarily 
terminate entitlement acquired under paragraph (d)(1) of this section by 
filing, with SSA or HCFA, a request for disenrollment.
    (ii) Voluntary disenrollment is effective as follows:
    (A) If the individual files a request within 30 days after the date 
of HCFA's notice that buy-in coverage has ended, the individual's 
entitlement ends on the last day of the last month for which the State 
paid the premium.
    (B) If the individual files the request more than 30 days but not 
more than 6 months after buy-in coverage ends, entitlement ends on the 
last day of the month in which the request is filed.
    (C) If the individual files the request later than the 6th month 
after buy-in coverage ends, entitlement ends at the

[[Page 151]]

end of the month after the month in which request is filed.

Sec. 406.28  End of entitlement.

    Any of the following actions or events ends entitlement to premium 
hospital insurance:
    (a) Filing of request for termination. The beneficiary may at any 
time give HCFA or the Social Security Administration written notice that 
he or she no longer wishes to participate in the premium hospital 
insurance program.
    (1) If he or she files the notice before entitlement begins, he or 
she will be deemed not to have enrolled.
    (2) If he or she files the notice after entitlement begins, that 
entitlement will end at the close of the month following the month in 
which he or she filed the notice.
    (b) Eligibility for hospital insurance without premiums. (1) If an 
individual meets the eligibility requirements for hospital insurance 
specified in Sec. 406.10, Sec. 406.11, Sec. 406.13 or Sec. 406.15, 
entitlement to premium hospital insurance ends with the month before the 
month in which he or she meets those requirements.
    (2) If an individual meets the requirements of Sec. 406.10, 
Sec. 406.11, Sec. 406.13, or Sec. 406.15, he or she will be deemed to 
have filed the required application for hospital insurance benefits in 
his or her first month of eligibility under that section.
    (c) End of entitlement to supplementary medical insurance (SMI) for 
individual who has attained age 65. In the case of an individual 
enrolled on the basis of Sec. 406.20(b), entitlement to premium hospital 
insurance ends on the same date that entitlement to SMI ends.
    (d) Nonpayment of premium. (1) If an individual fails to pay the 
premium bill, entitlement will end on the last day of the third month 
after the billing month.
    (2) HCFA may reinstate entitlement if the individual shows good 
cause for failure to pay on time, and pays all overdue premiums within 3 
calendar months after the date specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section.
    (e) Death. Entitlement ends with the day of death. (A premium is due 
for the month of death.)
    (f) End of disabling impairment for individual under age 65. In the 
case of an individual enrolled on the basis of Sec. 406.20(c), 
entitlement to premium hospital insurance ends on the last day of the 
month after the month in which the individual is notified that he or she 
no longer has a disabling impairment.

Sec. 406.32  Monthly premiums.

    (a) Promulgation and effective date. Beginning with 1984, premiums 
are promulgated each September, effective for the succeeding calendar 
year.
    (b) Monthly premiums: Determination of dollar amount.
    (1) Effective for calendar years beginning January 1989, the dollar 
amount is determined based on an estimate of one-twelfth of the average 
per capita costs for benefits and administrative costs that will be 
payable with respect to individuals age 65 or over from the Federal 
Hospital Insurance Trust Fund during the succeeding calendar year.
    (2) Before 1989, the dollar amount was determined by multiplying $33 
by the ratio of the next year's inpatient deductible to $76, which was 
the inpatient deductible determined for 1973. (Because of cost controls, 
the deductible actually charged for that year was $72.)
    (3) Effective for months beginning January 1994, if an individual 
meets the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section, the monthly 
premium determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is reduced in 
each month in which the individual meets the requirements by 25 percent 
in 1994, 30 percent in 1995, 35 percent in 1996, 40 percent in 1997 and 
45 percent in 1998 and thereafter.
    (4) The amount determined under paragraphs (b) (1), (2), or (3) of 
this section is rounded to the next nearest multiple of $1. (Fifty cents 
is rounded to the next higher dollar.)
    (c) Qualifying for a reduction in monthly premium. An individual who 
qualifies for the reduction described in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section must be an individual who--

[[Page 152]]

    (1) Has 30 or more quarters of coverage (QCs) as defined in 20 CFR 
404.140 through 404.146;
    (2) Has been married for at least the previous one year period to a 
worker who has 30 or more QCs;
    (3) Had been married to a worker who had 30 or more QCs for a period 
of at least one year before the death of the worker;
    (4) Is divorced from, after at least 10 years of marriage to, a 
worker who had 30 or more QCs at the time the divorce became final; or
    (5) Is divorced from, after at least 10 years of marriage to, a 
worker who subsequently died and who had 30 or more QCs at the time the 
divorce became final.
    (d) Monthly premiums: Increase for late enrollment and for 
reenrollment. For an individual who enrolls after the close of the 
initial enrollment period or reenrolls, the amount of the monthly 
premium, as determined under paragraph (b) of this section, is increased 
by 10 percent for each full 12 months in the periods described in 
Secs. 406.33 and 406.34. Effective beginning with premiums due for July 
1986, the premium increase is limited to 10 percent and is payable for 
twice the number of full 12-month periods determined under those 
sections.
    (e) Collection of monthly premiums. (1) HCFA will bill the enrollee 
on a monthly basis and include an addressed return envelope with the 
bill.
    (2) The enrollee must pay by check or money order that is payable to 
``HCFA Medicare Insurance,'' and shows his or her name and the claim 
number that appears on his or her Medicare card. He or she must return 
the bill with the check or money order.
    (f) Months for which payment is due. (1) A premium payment is due 
for each month beginning with the first month of coverage and continuing 
through the month of death or if earlier, the month in which coverage 
ends.
    (2) A premium is due for the month of death if coverage is still in 
effect, even if the individual dies on the first day of the month.
    (g) Option for group payments. A public or private organization may 
pay the premiums on behalf of one or more enrollees under a contract or 
other arrangement with HCFA if HCFA determines that this method of 
payment is administratively feasible. (The rules set forth in subpart E 
of part 408 of this chapter, for SMI premiums, also apply to group 
payment of Part A premiums.)

<R05>
Sec. 406.33  Determination of months to be counted for premium increase: Enrollment.

    (a) Enrollment before April 1, 1981, or after September 30, 1981. 
The months to be counted for premium increase are the months from the 
end of the initial enrollment period through the end of the general 
enrollment period, the special enrollment period, or the transfer 
enrollment period in which the individual enrolls, excluding the 
following:
    (1) Any months before September 1973.
    (2) For premiums due for months after May 1986, any months beginning 
with January 1983 during which the individual was enrolled in an 
employer group health plan based on the current employment of the 
individual or the individual's spouse.
    (3) Any months during the 7-month special enrollment period under 
Sec. 406.21(e) during which premium hospital insurance coverage is in 
effect.
    (4) Any months that the individual was enrolled in an HMO or CMP 
under part 417, subpart K of this chapter as described in 
Sec. 406.21(f).
    (b) Enrollment during the period April 1 through September 30, 1981. 
The months to be counted for premium increase are the months from the 
end of the initial enrollment period through the month in which the 
individual enrolled, excluding any months before September 1973.
    (c) Examples. (1) John F's initial enrollment period ended July 1979 
but he did not enroll until January 1980. The months to be counted are 
August 1979 through March 1980. Since only 8 months elapsed, there is no 
premium increase.

[[Page 153]]

    (2) Mary T's initial enrollment period ended in April 1980 but she 
did not enroll until May 1981. The months to be counted are May 1980 
through May 1981. Since 13 months has elapsed, the premium would be 
increased by 10 percent.
    (3) Effective with July 1986, Mary T, in Example 2, would no longer 
have to pay an increased premium because she had paid it for twice the 
number of full 12-month periods during which she could have been, but 
was not, enrolled in the program.
    (4) Vincent C's initial enrollment period ended August 31, 1986. He 
was covered under his wife's employer group health plan until she 
retired on May 31, 1989. He enrolled during June 1989, the first month 
of the special enrollment period under Sec. 406.21(e). No months are 
countable for premium increase purposes because the exclusions of 
paragraph (a) of this section apply to all months.
    (5) Terry P enrolled in the 1987 general enrollment period, with 
coverage effective July 1987. There were 28 months after the end of his 
initial enrollment period through the end of the 1987 general enrollment 
period. His premium is increased by 10 percent. The increase will be 
eliminated after he has paid the additional 10 percent for 48 months.

<R05>
Sec. 406.34  Determination of months to be counted for premium increase: Reenrollment.

    (a) First reenrollment before April 1, 1981 or after September 30, 
1981. The months to be counted for premium increase are:
    (1) The months specified in Sec. 406.33(a) or (b); plus
    (2) The months from the end of the first period of entitlement 
through the end of the general enrollment period in which the individual 
reenrolled.
    (b) First reenrollment during the period April 1, 1981 through 
September 30, 1981. The months to be counted for premium increase are--
    (1) The months specified in Sec. 406.33(a); plus
    (2) The months from the end of the first period of entitlement 
through the month in which the individual reenrolled.
    (c) Subsequent reenrollment during the period April 1, 1981 through 
September 30, 1981. The months to be counted for premium increase are--
    (1) The months specified in paragraph (a) of this section; plus
    (2) The months from April 1981 through the month in which the 
individual reenrolled for the second time. (Since only one reenrollment 
was permitted before April 1981, any months from the end of the 
individual's first enrollment period of entitlement through March 1981 
are not counted.)
    (d) Subsequent reenrollment after September 30, 1981. The months to 
be counted for premium increase are--
    (1) The months specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, 
for the first and second periods of coverage; plus
    (2) The months from the end of each subsequent period of entitlement 
through the end of the general enrollment period in which the individual 
reenrolled, excluding any months before April 1981.
    (e) Example. Peter M enrolled during his initial enrollment period, 
terminated his first coverage period in August 1979 and reenrolled for 
the first time in January 1980. The 7 months to be counted (September 
1979 through March, 1980) were not enough to require any increase in the 
premium. Peter terminated his second period of coverage in February 1981 
and reenrolled for the second time in July 1981. Since the 4 months 
(April through July 1981), when added to the previous 7 months, bring 
the total to only 11 months, no premium increase is required.

<R05>
Sec. 406.38  Prejudice to enrollment rights because of Federal Government error.

    (a) If an individual's enrollment or nonenrollment for premium 
hospital insurance is unintentional, inadvertent, or erroneous because 
of the error, misrepresentation, or inaction of a

[[Page 154]]

Federal employee, or any person authorized by the Federal Government to 
act on its behalf, the Social Security Administration or HCFA may take 
whatever action it determines is necessary to provide appropriate 
relief.
    (b) The action may include--
    (1) Designation of a special initial or general enrollment period;
    (2) Designation of an entitlement period;
    (3) Adjustment of premiums;
    (4) Any combination of the actions specified in paragraph (b) (1) 
through (3) of this section; or
    (5) Any other remedial action which may be necessary to correct or 
eliminate the effects of such error, misrepresentation, or inaction.

                                Insurance


<R05>
Sec. 406.50  Nonpayment of benefits on behalf of certain aliens.

    (a) Hospital insurance benefit payments may not be made for services 
furnished to an alien in any month in which his or her monthly social 
security benefits are suspended (or would be suspended if he or she were 
entitled to those benefits) because the alien remains outside the United 
States for more than 6 months.
    (b) Benefits will be payable beginning with services furnished in 
the first full calendar month the alien is back in the United States.

<R05>
Sec. 406.52  Conviction of certain offenses.

    (a) Penalty that affects entitlement. (1) If an individual is 
convicted of any of the crimes listed in Sec. 406.11(c) (1) and (2), the 
court may impose, in addition to all other penalties, a penalty that 
affects entitlement to hospital insurance, beginning with the month of 
conviction.
    (2) The additional penalty is that the individual's income (or the 
income of the insured individual on whose earnings record he or she 
became or seeks to become entitled) for the year of conviction and any 
previous year may not be counted in determining the insured status 
necessary for entitlement to hospital insurance.
    (b) Effect of pardon. If the President of the United States pardons 
the convicted individual, that individual regains (or may again seek) 
entitlement effective with the month following the month in which the 
pardon is granted.

program is authorized by Part B of title XVIII of the Social Security 
Act.
    (1) Section 1831 of the Act establishes the program.
    (2) Sections 1836 and 1837 set forth the eligibility and enrollment 
requirements.
    (3) Section 1838 specifies the entitlement periods, which vary 
depending on the time and method of enrollment and on the basis for 
termination.
    (4) Section 1843 sets forth the requirements for State buy-in 
agreements under which States may enroll, and pay the SMI premiums for, 
eligible individuals who are also eligible for cash assistance or

entitlement requirements and procedures for supplementary medical 
insurance. (The rules about premiums are in part 408 of this chapter.)

    Part B of Title XVIII of the Act provides for voluntary 
``supplementary medical insurance'' available to most individuals age 65 
or over and to disabled individuals who are under age 65 and entitled to 
hospital insurance. The SMI program is financed by premiums paid by (or 
for) each individual enrolled in the program, plus contributions from 
Federal funds. It covers certain physicians' services, outpatient 
services, home health services, services furnished by rural health 
clinics (RHCs), Federally qualified health centers (FQHCS), ambulatory 
surgical centers (ASCs), and comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation 
facilities (CORFs), and other medical and other health services.

at any Social Security branch or district office, are used to apply for 
enrollment under the supplementary medical insurance program.

    HCFA-4040--Application for Enrollment in the Supplementary Medical 
Insurance Program. (This form is used for enrollment by individuals who 
are not eligible for monthly benefits or for hospital insurance.)
    HCFA-40-B--Application for Medical Insurance. (For general use by 
the SSA District Office in requesting medical insurance protection 
during the general enrollment period or during the initial enrollment

current supplementary medical insurance because of prior refusals, 
voluntary withdrawal, or premium default from prior coverage. It is used 
during the annual general enrollment period.)
    HCFA-40-F--Application for Medical Insurance. (For use by 
beneficiaries residing outside the United States.)
    HCFA-18-F-5--Application for Hospital Insurance Entitlement. (For 
use by individuals who are not eligible for retirement benefits under 
Title II of the Social Security Act or under the Railroad Retirement 
Act. This form may also be used for enrollment in the supplementary 
medical insurance program.)


As an alternative, the individual may request enrollment by answering 
the Part B enrollment questions on an application for monthly Social 
Security benefits, or by signing a simple statement of request, if he or 
she is eligible to enroll at that time.


<R05>
Sec. 407.12  General enrollment provisions.

    (a) Opportunity to enroll. (1) An individual who is eligible to 
enroll for SMI may do so during an initial enrollment period or a 
general enrollment period as specified in Secs. 407.14, and 407.15. An 
individual who meets the conditions specified in Sec. 407.20 may enroll 
during a special enrollment period, as provided in that section.
    (2) An individual who fails to enroll during his or her initial 
enrollment period or whose enrollment has been terminated may enroll or 
reenroll during a general enrollment period, or, if he or she meets the 
specified conditions, during a special enrollment period.
    (b) Enrollment periods ending on a nonworkday. (1) If an enrollment 
period ends on a Federal nonworkday, that period is automatically 
extended to the next succeeding workday.
    (2) A Federal nonworkday is any Saturday, Sunday, or Federal legal 
holiday or a day that is declared by statute or executive order to be a 
day on which Federal employees are not required to work.


<R05>
Sec. 407.14  Initial enrollment period.

    (a) Duration. (1) The initial enrollment period is the 7-month 
period that begins 3 months before the month an individual first meets 
the eligibility requirements of Sec. 407.10 and ends 3 months after that 
first month of eligibility.
    (2) In determining the initial enrollment period of an individual 
who is age 65 or over and eligible for enrollment solely because of 
entitlement to hospital insurance, the individual is considered as first 
meeting the eligibility requirements for SMI on the first day he or she 
becomes entitled to hospital insurance or would have been entitled if he 
or she filed an application for that program.
    (b) Deemed initial enrollment period. (1) SSA or HCFA will establish 
a deemed initial enrollment period for an individual who fails to enroll 
during the initial enrollment period because of a belief, based on 
erroneous documentary evidence, that he or she had not yet attained age 
65. The period will be established as though the individual had attained 
age 65 on the date indicated by the incorrect information.
    (2) A deemed initial enrollment period established under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section is used to determine the individual's premium and 
right to enroll in a general enrollment period if that is advantageous 
to the individual.

[[Page 157]]


<R05>
Sec. 407.15  General enrollment period.

    (a) Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the 
general enrollment period is January through March of each calendar 
year.
    (b) An unlimited general enrollment period existed between April 1 
and September 30, 1981. Any eligible individual whose initial enrollment 
period had ended, or whose previous period of entitlement had 
terminated, could have enrolled or reenrolled during any month of that 
6-month period.


<R05>
Sec. 407.17  Automatic enrollment.

    (a) Who is automatically enrolled. An individual is automatically 
enrolled for SMI if he or she:
    (1) Resides in the United States, except in Puerto Rico;
    (2) Becomes entitled to hospital insurance under any of the 
provisions set forth in Secs. 406.10 through 406.15 of this chapter; and
    (3) Does not decline SMI enrollment.
    (b) Opportunity to decline automatic enrollment. (1) SSA will notify 
an individual that he or she is automatically enrolled under paragraph 
(a) of this section and grant the individual a specified period (at 
least 2 months after the month the notice is mailed) to decline 
enrollment.
    (2) The individual may decline enrollment by submitting to SSA or 
HCFA a signed statement that he or she does not wish SMI.
    (3) The statement must be submitted before entitlement begins, or if 
later, within the time limits set in the notice of enrollment.


<R05>
Sec. 407.18  Determining month of automatic enrollment.

    (a) An individual who is automatically enrolled in SMI under 
Sec. 407.17 will have the month of enrollment determined in accordance 
with paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section. The month of enrollment 
determines the month of entitlement.
    (b) An individual is automatically enrolled in the third month of 
the initial enrollment period if he or she--
    (1) Is entitled to social security benefits under section 202 of the 
Act on the first day of the initial enrollment period;
    (2) Is entitled to hospital insurance based on end-stage renal 
disease; on entitlement to disability benefits as a social security or 
railroad retirement beneficiary; or on deemed entitlement to disability 
benefits on the basis of Medicare-qualified government employment; or
    (3) Establishes entitlement to hospital insurance by filing an 
application and meeting all other requirements (as set forth in subpart 
B of part 406 of this chapter) during the first 3 months of the initial 
enrollment period.
    (c) If an individual establishes entitlement to hospital insurance 
on the basis of an application filed in the last 4 months of the SMI 
initial enrollment period, he or she is automatically enrolled for SMI 
in the month in which the application is filed.
    (d) If an individual establishes entitlement to hospital insurance 
on the basis of an application filed after the SMI initial enrollment 
period but not during a general enrollment period in effect before April 
1, 1981, or after September 30, 1981, he or she is automatically 
enrolled for SMI on the first day of the next general enrollment period.
    (e) If the individual establishes entitlement to hospital insurance 
on the basis of an application filed during a SMI general enrollment 
period in effect before April 1, 1981 or after September 30, 1981, he or 
she is automatically enrolled on the first day of that period.
    (f) If an individual established entitlement to hospital insurance 
on the basis of an application filed during the general enrollment 
period of April 1, 1981, through September 30, 1981, he or she was 
automatically enrolled for SMI on the first day of the month in which 
the application was filed.


<R05>
Sec. 407.20  Special enrollment period related to coverage under group health plans.

    (a) Terminology--(1) Group health plan (GHP) and large group health 
plan (LGHP). These terms have the meanings given them in Sec. 411.101 of 
this chapter except that the ``former employee'' language of those 
definitions does not apply with respect to SEPs for the reasons 
specified in Sec. 406.24(a)(3) of this chapter.

[[Page 158]]

    (2) Special enrollment period (SEP). This term has the meaning set 
forth in Sec. 406.24(a)(4) of this chapter. In order to use a SEP, an 
individual must meet the conditions of paragraph (b) and of paragraph 
(c) or (d) of this section, as appropriate.
    (b) General rule. All individuals must meet the following 
conditions:
    (1) They are eligible to enroll for SMI on the basis of age or 
disability, but not on the basis of end-stage renal disease.
    (2) When first eligible for SMI coverage (4th month of their initial 
enrollment period), they were covered under a GHP or LGHP on the basis 
of current employment status or, if not so covered, they enrolled in SMI 
during their initial enrollment period; and
    (3) For all months thereafter, they maintained coverage under either 
SMI or a GHP or LGHP. (Generally, if an individual fails to enroll in 
SMI during any available SEP, he or she is not entitled to any 
additional SEPs. However, if an individual fails to enroll during a SEP 
because coverage under the same or a different GHP or LGHP was restored 
before the end of that particular SEP, that failure to enroll does not 
preclude additional SEPs.)
    (c) Special rule: Individual age 65 or over. For an individual who 
is or was covered under a GHP, coverage must be by reason of the current

    (d) Special rules: Disabled individual.<SUP>4</SUP> Individuals 
entitled on the basis of disability (but not on the basis of end-stage 
renal disease) must meet conditions that vary depending on whether they 
were covered under a GHP or an LGHP.

    The following apply whether an individual is self-enrolled or 
automatically enrolled in SMI:
    (a) Enrollment during initial enrollment period. (1) If an 
individual enrolls during the first three months of the initial 
enrollment period, entitlement begins with the first month of

initial enrollment period, entitlement begins with the third month after 
the month of enrollment.
    (5) Example. An individual first meets the eligibility requirements 
for enrollment in April. The initial enrollment period is January 
through July. The month in which the individual enrolls determines the 
month that begins the period of entitlement, as follows:

<R05>
Sec. 407.27  Termination of entitlement: Individual enrollment.

    An individual's entitlement will terminate for any of the following 
reasons:
    (a) Death. Entitlement to SMI ends on the last day of the month in 
which the individual dies.
    (b) Termination of hospital insurance benefits. If an individual's 
entitlement to hospital insurance ends before the month in which he or 
she attains age 65, entitlement to SMI will end on the same day unless 
it has been previously terminated in accordance with paragraph (c) or 
(d) of this section.
    (c) Request by individual. An individual may at any time give HCFA 
or SSA written notice that he or she no longer wishes to participate in 
SMI, and request disenrollment.
    (1) Before July 1987, entitlement ended at the end of the calendar 
quarter after the quarter in which the individual filed the 
disenrollment request.
    (2) For disenrollment requests filed in or after July 1987, 
entitlement ends at the end of the month after the month in which the 
individual files the disenrollment request.
    (d) Nonpayment of premiums. If an individual fails to pay the 
premiums, entitlement will end as provided in the rules for SMI 
premiums, set forth in part 408 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 407.30  Limitations on enrollment.

    (a) Initial enrollment periods--(1) Individual under age 65. An 
individual who has not attained age 65 may have one or more periods of 
entitlement to hospital insurance, based on disability. Since each 
period of disability entitlement entitles the individual to hospital 
insurance and since entitlement to hospital insurance makes the 
individual eligible for SMI enrollment, an individual may have an SMI 
initial enrollment period for each continous period of entitlement to 
hospital insurance.
    (2) Individuals who have attained age 65. An individual who has 
attained age 65 may not have more than one initial enrollment period on 
the basis of age. However, if the individual develops ESRD after age 65, 
he or she may have another initial enrollment period based on meeting 
the requirements of Sec. 406.13 of this chapter.
    (b) Number of enrollments. There is no limitation on the number of 
enrollments.
    (c) Coverage under buy-in agreements. For purposes of paragraph (a) 
of this section, the continued enrollment of an individual following the 
end of coverage under a State buy-in agreement in considered an initial 
enrollment.

<R05>
Sec. 407.32  Prejudice to enrollment rights because of Federal Government misrepresentation, inaction, or error.

    If an individual's enrollment or nonenrollment in SMI is 
unintentional, inadvertent, or erroneous because of the error, 
misrepresentation, on inaction of a Federal employee or any person 
authorized by the Federal Government to act in its behalf, the Social 
Security Administration or HCFA may take whatever action it determines 
is necessary to provide appropriate relief. The action may include:
    (a) Designation of a special initial or general enrollment period;
    (b) Designation of an entitlement period based on that enrollment 
period;
    (c) Adjustment of premiums;
    (d) Any combination of actions under paragraphs (a) through (c) of 
this section; or
    (e) Any other remedial action that may be necessary to correct or 
eliminate the effects of the error, misrepresentation, or inaction.

                   Subpart C--State Buy-In Agreements


<R05>
Sec. 407.40  Enrollment under a State buy-in agreement.

    (a) Statutory basis. (1) Section 1843 of the Act, as amended through 
1969, permitted a State to enter into an agreement with the Secretary to 
enroll in the SMI program certain individuals who are eligible for SMI 
and who are members of the buy-in group specified in the agreement. A 
buy-in group could include certain individuals receiving Federally-aided 
State cash assistance (with the option of excluding individuals also 
entitled to social security benefits or railroad retirement benefits) or 
could include all individuals eligible for Medicaid. Before 1981, 
December 31, 1969 was the last day on which a State could request a buy-
in agreement or a modification to include a coverage group broader than 
the one originally selected.
    (2) Section 945(e) of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980 (Pub. 
L. 96-499) further amended section 1843 to provide that, during calendar 
year 1981, a State could request a buy-in agreement if it did not 
already have one, or request a broader coverage group for an existing 
agreement.
    (3) Several laws enacted during 1980-1987 had the effect of 
requiring that the buy-in groups available under section 1843 of the Act 
be expanded to include certain individuals who lose eligibility for cash 
assistance payments but are treated as if they were cash assistance 
recipients for Medicaid eligibility purposes.
    (4) Section 301(e)(1) of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 
1988 (Pub. L. 100-360) amends section 1843 of the Act to restore the 
1981 provisions on a permanent basis, effective ``after 1988.''
    (5) The same section 301, as amended by section 608(d)(14)(H) of the 
Family Support Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-485), further amended section 
1843 of the Act, beginning January 1, 1989, to establish a new buy-in 
category consisting of Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries and to provide 
that a State may request a buy-in agreement if it does not already have 
one, or request a broader buy-in group for the existing agreement.
    (b) Definitions. As used in this section, unless the context 
indicates otherwise--
    Cash assistance means any of the following kinds of monthly cash 
benefits, authorized by specified titles of the Act and, for 
convenience, represented by initials, as follows:
    AABD stands for aid to the aged, blind or disabled under the first 
title XVI of the Act in effect until December 31, 1973.
    AB stands for aid to the blind under title X of the Act.
    AFDC stands for aid to families with dependent children under Part A 
of title IV of the Act.
    APTD stands for aid to the permanently and totally disabled under 
title XIV of the Act.
    OAA stands for old-age assistance under title I of the Act.
    SSI stands for supplemental security income for the aged, blind, and 
disabled under the second title XVI of the Act, effective January 1, 
1974.
    SSP stands for State supplementary payments, whether mandatory or 
optional, to an aged, blind, or disabled individual under the second 
title XVI or the Act.

[[Page 161]]

    Qualified Medicare Beneficiary or QMB means an individual who meets 
the definition in Sec. 400.200 of this chapter and, therefore, is 
eligible to have the State Medicaid agency pay Medicare cost sharing 
amounts on his or her behalf.
    Railroad retirement beneficiary means an individual entitled to 
receive an annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974.
    State means one of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Guam, 
Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, or the Northern Mariana 
Islands, except when reference is made to ``the 50 States''.
    State buy-in agreement or buy-in agreement means an agreement 
authorized by section 1843 of the Act, under which a State secures SMI 
or premium HI coverage for individuals who are members of the buy-in 
group specified in the agreement, by enrolling them and paying the 
premiums on their behalf.
    (c) Basic rules.
    (1) A State that has a buy-in agreement in effect must enroll any 
individual who is eligible to enroll in SMI under Sec. 407.10.
    (2) Any State that does not have a buy-in agreement in effect may 
request buy-in for any one of the groups specified in Secs. 407.42 and 
407.43.
    (3) Any State that does have an agreement may request a modification 
to cover a broader buy-in group or cancel its current agreement and 
request a new agreement to cover a narrower group.

Sec. 407.45  Termination of State buy-in agreements.

    (a) Termination by the State--(1) Termination after advance notice. 
A State may terminate its buy-in agreement after giving HCFA 3 months, 
advance notice.
    (2) Termination without advance notice. A State may terminate its 
buy-in agreement without advance notice if--
    (i) The State gives HCFA written certification to the effect that it 
is no longer legally able to comply with one or more of the provisions 
of the agreement; and
    (ii) Submits a supporting opinion from the appropriate State legal 
officer, if HCFA requests such an opinion.
    (b) Termination by HCFA. If HCFA, after giving the State notice and 
opportunity for hearing, finds that the

[[Page 163]]

State has failed to comply substantially with one or more of the 
provisions of the agreement, other than the requirement for timely 
payment of premiums, HCFA will give the State written notice to the 
effect that the agreement will terminate on the date indicated in the 
notice unless, before that date, HCFA finds that there is no longer that 
failure to comply. (Rules for collection of overdue premiums, including 
assessment of interest and offset against FFP due the State, are those 
set forth in the Notice published on September 30, 1985 at 50 FR 39784.)


<R05>
Sec. 407.47  Beginning of coverage under a State buy-in agreement.

    (a) General rule. The beginning of an individual's coverage period 
depends on two factors:
    (1) The individual's meeting the SMI eligibility requirements and 
the requirements for being a member of the buy-in group; and
    (2) The effective date of the buy-in agreement or agreement 
modification that covers the group to which the individual belongs, and 
which may not be earlier than the third month after the month in which 
the agreement or modification is executed.
    (b) Application of general rule: Medicaid eligibles who are, or are 
treated as, cash assistance recipients. For Medicaid eligibles who are, 
or are treated as, cash assistance recipients (that is, are members of 
categories A through E of Sec. 407.42(a) or categories A through C of 
Sec. 407.43(a)), coverage begins with the later of the following:
    (1) The first month in which the individual--
    (i) Meets the SMI eligibility requirements specified in Sec. 407.10; 
and
    (ii) Is a member of one of those categories.
    (2) The month in which the buy-in agreement is effective.
    (c) Application of general rule: Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries. 
For individuals who are QMBs (that is, are members of category F of 
Sec. 407.42 or category D of Sec. 407.43(a)), coverage begins with the 
later of the following:
    (1) The first month in which the individual meets the SMI 
eligibility requirements specified in Sec. 407.10, and has QMB status.
    (2) The month in which the buy-in agreement or agreement 
modification covering QMBs is effective.
    (d) Application of general rule: Other individuals eligible for 
Medicaid. For individuals who are members of category G of 
Sec. 407.42(a) or category E of Sec. 407.43(a), coverage begins with the 
later of the following:
    (1) The second month after the month in which the individual--
    (i) Meets the SMI eligibility requirements specified in Sec. 407.10; 
and
    (ii) Is determined to be eligible for Medicaid.
    (2) The month in which the buy-in agreement or agreement 
modification is effective.
    (e) Coverage based on erroneous report. If the State erroneously 
reports to SSA that an individual is a member of its coverage group, the 
rules of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section apply, and coverage 
begins as though the individual were in fact a member of the group. 
Coverage will end only as provided in Sec. 407.48.

    An individual's coverage under a buy-in agreement terminates with 
the earliest of the following events:
    (a) Death. Coverage ends on the last day of the month in which the 
individual dies.
    (b) Loss of entitlement to hospital insurance benefits before age 
65. If an individual loses entitlement to hospital insurance benefits 
before attaining age 65, coverage ends on the last day of the last month 
for which he or she is entitled to hospital insurance.
    (c) Loss of eligibility for the buy-in group. If an individual loses 
eligibility for inclusion in the buy-in group, buy-in coverage ends as 
follows:
    (1) On the last day of the last month for which he or she is 
eligible for inclusion in the group, if HCFA determines ineligibility or 
receives a State ineligibility notice by the 25th day of the second 
month after the month in which the individual becomes ineligible for 
inclusion in the group.
    (2) On the last day of the second month before the month in which

[[Page 164]]

HCFA receives a State ineligibility notice later than the time specified 
in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. A notice received by HCFA after the 
25th day of the month is considered to have been received in the 
following month.
    (d) Termination or modification of buy-in agreement. If the State's 
buy-in agreement is terminated, or modified to substitute a narrower 
buy-in group, coverage ends on the last day of the last month for which 
the agreement was in effect, or covered the broader buy-in group.

Sec. 407.50  Continuation of coverage: Individual enrollment following end of coverage under a State buy-in agreement.

    (a) Deemed enrollment. When coverage under a buy-in agreement ends 
because the agreement terminates, or is modified to substitute a 
narrower buy-in group, or because the individual is no longer eligible 
for inclusion in the buy-in group, the individual--
    (1) Is considered to have enrolled during his or her initial 
enrollment period; and
    (2) Will be entitled to SMI on this basis and liable for SMI 
premiums beginning with the first month for which he or she is no longer 
covered under the buy-in agreement.
    (b) Voluntary termination. (1) An individual may voluntarily 
terminate entitlement acquired under paragraph (a) of this section by 
filing, with SSA or HCFA, a request for disenrollment.
    (2) Voluntary disenrollment is effective as follows:
    (i) If the individual files a request within 30 days after the date 
of HCFA's notice that buy-in coverage has ended, the individual's 
entitlement ends on the last day of the last month for which the State 
paid the premium.
    (ii) If the individual files the request more than 30 days but not 
more than 6 months after buy-in coverage ends, entitlement ends on the 
last day of the month in which the request is filed.
    (iii) If the individual files the request later than the 6th month 
after buy-in coverage ends, entitlement ends at the end of the month 
after the month in which request is filed.<SUP>1</SUP>

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 408.1  Statutory basis.

    (a) This part implements certain provisions of sections 1837 through 
1840 and 1881(d) of the Social Security Act (the Act) and conforms to 
other regulations that implement section 1843 of the Act. Section 
1838(b) requires regulations to establish when an individual's coverage 
ends because of nonpayment of premiums. It also specifies that those 
regulations may provide a grace period for payment of overdue premiums 
without loss of coverage. Section 1839 sets forth the specific 
procedures for determining the amount of the monthly premium and section 
1840 establishes the rules for payment of premiums. Section 1843 
provides that a State may enter into a buy-in agreement to secure SMI 
coverage for certain individuals by enrolling them in the SMI program 
and paying the premiums on their behalf. Section 1881(d) provides that 
Medicare payment, for the reasonable charges incurred in connection with 
a kidney donation, shall be made (without regard to deductible, premium, 
or coinsurance provisions of title XVIII) as prescribed in regulations.
    (b) The Federal Claims Collection Act (31 U.S.C. 3711), as 
implemented by 4 CFR parts 101-105, provides the basic authority for 
recovery of debts owed the United States government and specifies the 
conditions for the suspension or termination of collection action. 
Departmental regulations at 45 CFR part 30, updated by a final rule 
published on January 5, 1987 (52 FR 260) set forth procedures for the 
exercise of the Department's authority to collect and dispose of debts 
and were intended to complement rules applicable to particular programs. 
HCFA rules are set forth at 42 CFR part 401, subpart F.

[52 FR 48115, Dec. 18, 1987; 53 FR 4158, Feb. 12, 1988, as amended at 56 
FR 48112, Sept. 24, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 408.2  Scope and purpose.

    (a) This part sets forth the policies and procedures for determining 
the amount of monthly supplementary medical insurance (SMI) premiums, 
for the payment, collection, or refund of premiums, for termination of 
coverage because of nonpayment of premiums, and for reinstatement of 
coverage if certain conditions are met. It conforms to subpart C of part 
407 of this chapter, which sets forth the requirements for State buy-in 
agreements. These policies are intended to protect enrollee coverage to 
the maximum degree compatible with maintaining the integrity of the SMI 
program.
    (b) Policies that apply to premiums that certain individuals must 
pay in order to become entitled to Medicare Part A hospital insurance 
benefits, are set forth in part 406 of this chapter.

[52 FR 48115, Dec. 18, 1987; 53 FR 4159, Feb. 12, 1988]

[[Page 166]]


<R05>
Sec. 408.3  Definitions.

    As used in this part, unless the context indicates otherwise--
    Enrollee means an individual who is enrolled in the SMI program 
under Medicare Part B.
    Taxable year means the 12-month period (calendar or fiscal year) for 
which the individual files his or her income tax return.


<R05>
Sec. 408.4  Payment obligations.

    (a) Month for which payment is due. (1) A payment is due for each 
month, beginning with the first month of SMI coverage and continuing 
through the month of death or, if earlier, the month in which coverage 
terminates.
    (2) A premium is due for the month of death, if SMI coverage is 
still in effect, even though the individual dies on the first day of the 
month.
    (b) Overdue premiums. (1) Overdue premiums constitute an obligation 
enforceable against the enrollee or the enrollee's estate.
    (2) Overdue premiums are collected--
    (i) By deduction from social security or railroad retirement 
benefits or Federal civil service annuities;
    (ii) Directly from the enrollee or the enrollee's estate; or
    (iii) By offset against any SMI payments payable to the enrollee or 
the enrollee's estate.
    (3) Interest is not charged on overdue premiums, except under a 
State buy-in agreement, as provided in Sec. 408.6(c)(4).
    (c) Premiums not required for certain kidney donors. (1) No premiums 
are required for SMI benefits related to the donation of a kidney if the 
donor is not an enrollee.
    (2) A kidney donor who is an enrollee is not relieved of the 
obligation for premiums.

[52 FR 48115, Dec. 18, 1987; 53 FR 4159, Feb. 12, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 408.6  Methods and priorities for payment.

    (a) Methods of payment--(1) General rules. Premiums are paid by one 
of the following four methods:
    (i) Payment by a State under a buy-in agreement.
    (ii) Deduction from monthly railroad retirement of social security 
cash benefits or Federal civil service annuities.
    (iii) Direct remittance on an individual basis, by or on behalf of 
the enrollee.
    (iv) Direct remittance on a group basis, by an employer, union, 
lodge or other organization, or by an entity of State or local 
government.
    (2) Special situations. (i) If the monthly social security benefit 
or age 72 special benefit is less than the monthly premium, the benefit 
is withheld and the enrollee is required to pay the balance through 
direct remittance. (This situation may arise if the individual first 
becomes eligible for social security benefits after December 31, 1981, 
and is, therefore, not eligible for the fixed minimum, or receives age 
72 special benefits that are reduced because the individual receives a 
government pension.)
    (ii) If the monthly railroad retirement benefit or civil service 
annuity payment is less than the premium, the monthly payment is not 
withheld and the enrollee is required to pay the total premium by direct 
remittance.
    (b) Priorities for payment. (1) If an enrollee is enrolled under a 
State buy-in agreement--
    (i) SMI premiums may not be deducted from monthly cash benefits or 
annuities; and
    (ii) The enrollee may not be required to pay by direct remittance.
    (2) If an enrollee is not covered under a State buy-in agreement, 
but is receiving a monthly benefit or an annuity specified in paragraph 
(a)(1)(ii) of this section--
    (i) The premiums are deducted from that benefit or annuity; or
    (ii) If the monthly benefit or payment is less than the monthly 
premium, the rules of paragraph (a)(2) of this section apply.
    (3) If an enrollee is neither covered under a State buy-in 
agreement, nor receiving monthly benefits or annuity payments, the 
premiums must be paid totally by direct remittance.
    (c) Payment by a State under a buy-in agreement. (1) A buy-in 
agreement is an agreement under which a State, through enrollment and 
payment of SMI premiums, secures SMI benefits

[[Page 167]]

for individuals who are eligible for that program and also eligible for 
certain other cash or medical benefits. (Policies on enrollment under 
State buy-in agreements are contained in subpart C of part 407 of this 
chapter.)
    (2) The State pays the premiums for each month for which an 
individual is covered under the agreement.
    (3) If an individual's coverage under a State buy-in agreement 
terminates, his coverage continues on an individual enrollment basis. 
The premiums are then deducted from benefits, as set forth in subpart C 
of this part, or paid by direct remittance in accordance with subpart D 
or subpart E of this part.
    (4) Policy on collection of premiums from buy-in States is set forth 
in a Federal Register notice published on September 30, 1985 at 50 FR 
39784.


<R05>
Sec. 408.8  Grace period and termination date.

    (a) Grace period. (1) For all initial premium payments (monthly or 
quarterly), and subsequent monthly or quarterly payments, the grace 
period ends with the last day of the third month after the billing 
month.
    (2) For payments required because the monthly benefit is less than 
the monthly premium, the grace period ends on April 30 of the year 
following the calendar year which the premiums are due.
    (b) Extension of grace period: Last day is nonwork day. If the last 
day of the grace period is a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday, or a day 
that, by statute or executive order, is a nonwork day for Federal 
employees, the grace period is extended to the next succeeding work day.
    (c) Termination date. The end of the grace period is the termination 
date for SMI coverage if overdue premiums have not been paid by that 
date in accordance with Sec. 408.68.
    (d) Extension of grace period for good cause. (1) HCFA may reinstate 
entitlement, without interruption of coverage, if the individual shows 
good cause for failure to pay within the initial grace period, and pays 
all overdue premiums within three calendar months after the termination 
date.
    (2) Good cause will be found if the individual establishes, by a 
credible statement, that failure to pay premiums within the initial 
grace period was due to conditions over which he or she had no control, 
or which he or she could not reasonably have been expected to foresee.

[52 FR 48115, Dec. 18, 1987, as amended at 56 FR 48112, Sept. 24, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 408.10  Claim for monthly benefits pending concurrently with request for SMI enrollment.

    (a) If it is clear that an individual who applies for social 
security or railroad retirement benefits and for SMI will be entitled to 
monthly benefits, the application for monthly benefits is processed 
simultaneously with the request for SMI enrollment.
    (1) If monthly benefits are paid, the SMI premiums are deducted from 
those benefits.
    (2) If monthly benefits are suspended (for instance, because the 
individual's earnings exceed the maximum allowed by law), the enrollee 
is billed for direct remittance.
    (b) If it is clear that an individual will be entitled to SMI, but 
there is substantial question as to eligibility for monthly benefits, 
the request for SMI enrollment is processed separately.
    (1) When SMI enrollment is approved, the enrollee is billed for 
direct remittance.
    (2) When the application for monthly benefits is adjudicated, the 
following rules apply:
    (i) If monthly benefits are paid, the SMI premiums are deducted from 
those benefits, with appropriate adjustments for any premiums already 
paid by direct remittance.
    (ii) If the application for monthly benefits is approved but the 
benefits are suspended, the grace period is as set forth in 
Sec. 408.8(a).
    (iii) If the application for monthly benefits is denied, the grace 
period is as set forth in Sec. 408.8(a)(1).

<R04>
                  Subpart B--Amount of Monthly Premiums


<R05>
Sec. 408.20  Monthly premiums.

    (a) Statutory provisions. (1) The law established a monthly premium 
of $3 for the initial period of the program. It also set forth criteria 
and procedures for the Secretary to follow each December, beginning with 
December 1968, to determine and promulgate the standard monthly premium 
for the 12-month period beginning with July of the following year.
    (2) The law was amended in 1983 to require that the Secretary 
promulgate the standard monthly premium in September of that year, and 
each year thereafter, to be effective for the 12 months beginning with 
the following January.
    (3) The standard monthly premium applies to individuals who enroll 
during their initial enrollment periods. In other situations, that 
premium may be increased or decreased as specified in this subpart.
    (4) The law was further amended in 1984 to include a temporary 
``hold harmless'' provision (set forth in paragraph (e) of this 
section), that was subsequently extended and finally made permanent in 
1988.
    (b) Criteria and procedures for the period from July 1976 through 
December 1983, the period from January 1991 through December 1995, and 
for periods after December 1998. (1) For periods from July 1976 through 
December 1983 and after December 1998, the Secretary determines and 
promulgates as the standard monthly premium (for disabled as well as 
aged enrollees) the lower of the following:
    (i) The actuarial rate for the aged.
    (ii) The monthly premium promulgated the previous December for the 
year beginning July 1, increased by a percentage that is the same as the 
latest cost-of-living increase in old age insurance benefits that 
occurred before the current promulgation. (Because of the change in the 
effective dates of the premium amount (under paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section), there was no increase in the standard monthly premium for the 
period July 1983 through December 1983.)
    (2) For periods after December 1998, the Secretary determines the 
standard monthly premium in the manner specified in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section, but promulgates it in September for the following calendar 
year.
    (3) The premiums for calendar years 1991 through 1995 are those 
amounts as specified by section 1839(e)(1)(B) of the Act as follows:
    (i) In 1991, $29.90;
    (ii) In 1992, $31.80;
    (iii) In 1993, $36.60;
    (iv) In 1994, $41.10; and
    (v) In 1995, $46.10.
    (c) Premiums for calendar years 1984 through 1990 and 1996 through 
1998. For calendar years 1984 through 1990 and 1996 through 1998, the 
standard monthly premium for all enrollees--
    (1) Is equal to 50 percent of the actuarial rate for enrollees age 
65 or over, that is, is calculated on the basis of 25 percent of program 
costs without regard to any cost-of-living increase in old age insurance 
benefits; and
    (2) Is promulgated in the preceding September.
    (d) Limitation on increase of standard premium: 1987 and 1988. If 
there is no cost-of-living increase in old age or disability benefits 
for December 1985 or December 1986, the standard monthly premiums for 
1987 and 1988 (promulgated in September 1986 and September 1987, 
respectively) may not be increased.
    (e) Nonstandard premiums for certain cases--(1) Basic rule. A 
nonstandard premium may be established in individual cases only if the 
individual is entitled to old age or disability benefits for the months 
of November and December, and actually receives the corresponding 
benefit checks in December and January.
    (2) Special rules: Calendar years 1987 and 1988. For calendar years 
1987 and 1988, the following rules apply:
    (i) A nonstandard premium may be established if there is a cost-of-
living increase in old age or disability benefits but, because the 
increase in the standard premium is greater than the cost-of-living 
increase, the beneficiary would receive a lower cash benefit in January 
than he or she received in December.

[[Page 169]]

    (ii) A nonstandard premium may not be established if the reduction 
in the individual's benefit would result, in whole or in part, from any 
circumstance other than the circumstance described in paragraph 
(e)(2)(i) of this section.
    (3) Special rule: Calendar years after 1988. (i) Beginning with 
calendar year 1989, a premium increase greater than the cost-of-living 
increase is still a prerequisite for a nonstandard premium.
    (ii) However, a nonstandard premium is not precluded solely because 
the cash benefit is further reduced as a result of government pension 
offset or workers' compensation payment.
    (4) Amount of nonstandard premium. The nonstandard premium is the 
greater of the following:
    (i) The premium paid for December.
    (ii) The standard premium promulgated for January, reduced as 
necessary to compensate for--
    (A) The fact that the cost-of-living increase was less than the 
increase in the standard premium; or
    (B) The further reduction in benefit because of government pension 
offset or workers' compensation payments.
    (5) Effective dates of nonstandard premium. A nonstandard premium 
established under this paragraph (e) continues in effect for the rest of 
the calendar year even if later there are retroactive adjustments in 
benefit payments. (The nonstandard premium could be affected by a 
determination that the individual had not established, or had lost, 
entitlement to monthly benefits for November or December, or both.)
    (6) Effect of late enrollment or reenrollment. A nonstandard premium 
is subject to increase for late enrollment or reenrollment as required 
under other sections of this subpart. The increase is computed on the 
basis of the standard premium and added to the nonstandard premium.

[56 FR 8839, Mar. 1, 1991, as amended at 59 FR 26959, May 25, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 408.22  Increased premiums for late enrollment and for reenrollment.

[52 FR 48118, Dec. 18, 1987, as amended at 53 FR 6648, Mar. 2, 1988; 61 
FR 40347, Aug. 2, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 408.25  Individuals who enrolled or reenrolled between April 1 and September 30, 1981.

    (a) Basic rules. Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section, the rules set forth in Sec. 408.24 apply to an individual who 
enrolled or reenrolled between April 1 and September 30, 1981.
    (b) Exception. For an individual who enrolled or reenrolled between 
April 1 and September 30, 1981, the months to be counted ran through the 
month in which he or she reenrolled. (During those 6 months, continuous 
open enrollment was in effect and there was no 3-month ``general 
enrollment period''.)


<R05>
Sec. 408.26  Examples.

    Example 1. Mr. J, who became age 65 and otherwise eligible for 
enrollment in November 1965, first enrolls in March 1968. The months to 
be included in determining the amount of the increase in Mr. J's 
premiums begin with June 1966 (the first month after the close of his 
initial enrollment period) and extend through December 1967 (the period 
January through March of 1968 is excluded in determining the total 
months) for a total of 19 months. Since there is only one full 12-month 
period in 19 months, Mr. J's premiums will be 10 percent greater than if 
he had enrolled in his initial enrollment period.
    Example 2. Mr. V, who enrolled in December 1965, voluntarily 
terminates his enrollment effective midnight December 31, 1967. He 
enrolls for a second time in January 1969. The months to be included in 
determining the amount of the increase in Mr. V's premiums are January 
1968 through March 1969, a total of 15 months. Since this totals one 
full 12-month period. Mr. V's monthly premium, will be increased by 10 
percent.
    Example 3. Ms. N becomes age 65 in July 1965 and first enrolls in 
December 1967. She pays premiums increased by 10 percent above the 
regular rate, beginning July 1968, the first month of her SMI coverage. 
Ms. N fails to pay the premiums for the calendar quarter ending June 30, 
1970, and her coverage

[[Page 171]]

is terminated on that date, the end of her grace period. Ms. N enrolls 
for a second time in January 1971. The months to be included in 
determining the amount of the increase in Ms. N's premiums are June 1966 
through December 1967, a total of 19 months, and July 1970 through March 
1971, a total of 9 months, for a grand total of 28 months. Since this 
totals two full 12-month periods, Ms. N's monthly premium will be 
increased by 20 percent.
    Example 4. Mr. X attained age 65 in August 1966 and enrolled during 
his initial enrollment period. His coverage was terminated effective 
June 30, 1968, for nonpayment of premiums. He reenrolls in March 1973. 
For purposes of computing any applicable premium increase, he will not 
be charged any months between March 1971 (the end of the last general 
enrollment period during which he was eligible to reenroll under the law 
in effect before October 30, 1972) and January 1973. Therefore, he will 
be charged 36 months (July 1968-March 1971 plus January 1973-March 1973) 
and his premiums for his second period of coverage will be increased 30 
percent.
    Example 5. Ms. C, who attained age 65 in August 1973, had two 
periods of supplementary medical insurance coverage, both of which were 
terminated because of nonpayment of premiums: August 1973 through April 
1975 and July 1977 through August 1978. She reenrolls in July 1981. The 
months to be included in determining the amount of premium increase are 
May 1975 through March 1977 (23 months) and April 1981 through July 1981 
(4 months) for a total of 27 months. The 31 months from September 1978 
through March 1981 may not be counted because Ms. C was prevented from 
reenrolling by the two-enrollment limitation in effect before April 1, 
1981. For Ms. C, the standard monthly premium would be increased by 20 
percent.

Sec. 408.27  Rounding the monthly premium.

    Any monthly premium that is not a multiple of 10 cents is rounded to 
the nearest multiple of 10 cents, and any odd mulitple of 5 cents is 
rounded to the next higher multiple of 10 cents.

<R04>
               Subpart C--Deduction From Monthly Benefits


<R05>
Sec. 408.40  Deduction from monthly benefits: Basic rules.

    (a) Deduction from monthly benefits. (1) Enrollees who are receiving 
monthly benefits do not have the option of paying by direct remittance 
to avoid deduction.
    (2) If the enrollee is entitled to more than one type of monthly 
benefit, the order of priority for deduction is as follows:
    (i) Railroad retirement benefits.
    (ii) Social security benefits.
    (iii) Civil service annuities.
    (b) Deduction from initial or reinstated benefits. When an enrollee 
receives a monthly benefit check after an initial award or after a 
period of suspension, that check is, if administratively feasible, 
reduced or increased to deduct unpaid premiums or refund premiums paid 
in advance by direct remittance.
    (c) Ongoing deductions. The premium for each month is deducted from 
the cash benefit for the preceding month, e.g., the premium for March is 
deducted from the benefit for February, which is paid at the beginning 
of March.


<R05>
Sec. 408.42  Deduction from railroad retirement benefits.

    (a) Responsibility for deductions. If an enrollee is entitled to 
railroad retirement benefits, his or her SMI premiums are deducted from 
those benefits by the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) even though he or 
she is also entitled to social security benefits or a civil service 
annuity, or both.
    (b) Action when benefits are suspended. If the railroad retirement 
benefits are suspended, the RRB sends premium notices requesting direct 
remittance, to be made in accordance with the rules set forth in Subpart 
D of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 408.43  Deduction from social security benefits.

    SSA, acting as HCFA's agent, deducts the premiums from the monthly

[[Page 172]]

social security benefits if the enrollee is not entitled to railroad 
retirement benefits. (If the benefit is less than the monthly premium, 
the benefit is withheld and the enrollee is required to pay the balance 
through direct remittance.)


<R05>
Sec. 408.44  Deduction from civil service annuities.

    (a) Responsibility for deductions. If an enrollee is not entitled to 
railroad retirement benefits or social security benefits, and is 
receiving a civil service annuity, the premiums are deducted from that 
annuity by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on the basis of a 
notice from SSA indicating that the annuitant is entitled to SMI.
    (b) Deduction of spouse's premiums. If the annuitant's spouse is 
also enrolled for SMI and is not entitled to a civil service annuity or 
to social security or railroad retirement benefits, and the annuitant 
gives written consent, OPM also deducts the spouse's premium from the 
annuitant's monthly check.
    (c) Withdrawal of annuitant's consent. (1) If an annuitant wishes to 
withdraw consent for deduction of the spouse's premium, he or she must 
send written notice of withdrawal to OPM.
    (2) The withdrawal notice is effective with the third month after 
the month in which it is received, or with the month specified in the 
notice, whichever is later.


<R05>
Sec. 408.45  Deduction from age 72 special payments.

    (a) Deduction of premiums. SMI premiums are deducted from age 72 
special payments made under section 228 of the Act or the payments are 
withheld under procedures that correspond to the rules set forth in 
Secs. 408.40 and 408.43.
    (b) Collection of premiums while age 72 special payments are 
suspended. If the age 72 special payments are suspended, HCFA or its 
agent notifies the enrollee to pay premiums by direct remittance, in 
accordance with the rules set forth in Sec. 408.60.
    (c) Grace period. The grace period ends with the last day of the 
third month after the billing month.
    (d) Resumption of age 72 special payments. (1) If age 72 special 
payments are resumed before the end of the grace period and all premium 
arrears can be deducted from those special payments, SMI coverage 
continues and the enrollee need not pay by direct remittance.
    (2) Subsequent special payments are reduced by the amount of the 
premium for as long as the enrollee receives special payments.


<R05>
Sec. 408.46  Effect of suspension of social security benefits.

    (a) Benefit payments to be resumed during the taxable year. (1) If 
social security benefit payments are scheduled to be resumed during the 
enrollee's current taxable year, the enrollee is not billed.
    (2) The enrollee may, if he or she wishes, pay the premiums during 
suspension of benefits.
    (b) Benefit payments not to be resumed during the enrollee's current 
taxable year. (1) If social security benefits are suspended for a period 
that will not permit collection of all premiums due from monthly 
benefits payable in the enrollee's current taxable year, HCFA or its 
agents bill the enrollee and require direct remittance in accordance 
with subpart D of this part.
    (2) The first billing is for whatever premiums are necessary to 
place the enrollee in a quarterly cycle.
    (3) Thereafter, the billing is on a quarterly basis. (Quarters for 
different enrollees are staggered throughout the year.)
    (4) The enrollee has the option of paying premiums for more than one 
quarter at the same time.


<R05>
Sec. 408.47  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 408.50  When premiums are considered paid.

    (a) Actual deduction. A premium is considered paid if it is actually 
deducted from a monthly benefit check. Therefore--
    (1) The premium is ``paid'' even if SSA later finds that the benefit 
was paid in error; but
    (2) A finding that a monthly benefit was erroneously withheld does 
not constitute payment of the premium for

[[Page 173]]

that month. Since there was no payment, there was no deduction. The 
enrollee is billed and continuance of coverage depends on payment of 
premiums before the end of the grace period or extended grace period.
    (b) Payment within the grace period. Overdue premiums are considered 
paid within the grace period in the following situations:
    (1) Benefits are resumed during the grace period. (i) Monthly cash 
benefit payments are payable for the last month of the initial grace 
period or for earlier months on the basis of a notice filed by the 
enrollee before the initial grace period ends; and
    (ii) Those payments are sufficient to permit deduction of all 
overdue premiums.
    (2) Annual earnings report or other report submitted during the 
grace period shows a benefit is due. (i) Before the end of the grace 
period, the enrollee submits a report clearly showing that monthly cash 
benefits, previously withheld, are payable; and
    (ii) Those benefits are sufficient to permit deduction of the full 
amount of the overdue premiums.
    (3) Premium arrears are paid by direct remittance. The enrollee 
makes a direct remittance payment of all overdue premiums before the end 
of the grace period.

[52 FR 48115, Dec. 18, 1987; 53 FR 4159, Feb. 12, 1988; 56 FR 48112, 
Sept. 24, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 408.52  Change from direct remittance to deduction.

    If a direct remittance enrollee becomes entitled to monthly 
benefits--
    (a) The SMI premiums are deducted from those benefits; and
    (b) The enrollee is notified of the deduction and of any adjustment 
of the initial benefit check that is required to collect overdue 
premiums or refund premiums paid in advance.


<R05>
Sec. 408.53  Change from partial direct remittance to full deduction.

    If a benefit that was less than the premium (and therefore required 
direct remittance of the difference) is increased to an amount equal to, 
or greater than, the premium--
    (a) The full premium is paid from the benefit; and
    (b) Any amounts the enrollee had paid toward premiums not yet due 
are refunded.


<R04>
            Subpart D--Direct Remittance: Individual Payment


<R05>
Sec. 408.60  Direct remittance: Basic rules.

    (a) Premiums not deducted from monthly benefits under Subpart C of 
this part or paid by a State buy-in agreement must be paid by direct 
remittance to HCFA or its agents, by or on behalf of the enrollee.
    (b) Quarterly payment is preferred as more cost-effective, but 
monthly payment is accepted if the enrollee is unwilling or unable to 
make quarterly payments or is also paying hospital insurance premiums, 
which must be paid every month.
    (c) HCFA, directly or through its agents, sends quarterly or monthly 
premium bills and includes an addressed return envelope with the bill.
    (d) The individual must--
    (1) Send a check or money order that is drawn payable to ``HCFA 
Medicare Insurance'' and show the enrollee's name and claim number as it 
appears on the Medicare card; and
    (2) Return the bill with the check or money order in the 
preaddressed envelope.


<R05>
Sec. 408.62  Initial and subsequent billings.

    (a) Monthly billing. (1) The first premium bill is for the period 
from the first month of coverage (or the first month of change from 
deduction or State buy-in payment) through the end of the first month 
after the month of billing.
    (2) Subsequent billings are for periods of one month.
    (b) Quarterly billing. (1) The first premium bill is for the period 
from the first month of coverage (or of change from deduction or State 
buy-in payment) through the third month after the month of billing.
    (2) Subsequent billings are for periods of three months.

[[Page 174]]


<R05>
Sec. 408.63  Billing procedures when monthly benefits are less than monthly premiums.

    If monthly benefits are less than monthly premiums, the following 
procedures apply:
    (a) Notice of amount due. At the beginning of SMI entitlement, and 
at the beginning of each succeeding calendar year, SSA--
    (1) Notifies the enrollee of the amount of benefits payable for the 
rest of the year and the total premiums due for those same months; and
    (2) Bills the enrollee for the difference.
    (b) Notice of amount overdue. At the beginning of each succeeding 
calendar year, SSA--
    (1) Notifies the enrollee of any amounts overdue for premiums for 
the preceding calendar year; and
    (2) Indicates that if the amount still overdue on April 30 is equal 
to or greater than the premium for 3 months, SMI coverage will terminate 
on that date.


<R05>
Sec. 408.65  Payment options.

    (a) The enrollee is not asked to pay premiums at the time of 
enrollment but is instructed to pay them upon receipt of a premium bill 
from HCFA or its agents.
    (b) However, if the enrollee wishes, he or she may pay from one to 
12 months or from one to four quarters at the time of enrollment.


<R05>
Sec. 408.68  When premiums are considered paid.

    (a) Payment by check. The premium is considered paid if the check is 
paid by the bank the first or second time it is presented for payment.
    (b) Payment within the grace period. (1) A premium is considered 
paid within the grace period if it is delivered personally, or mailed on 
or before the last day of that period.
    (2) A premium payment is considered to have been mailed 7 days 
before it is received by HCFA.


<R05>
Sec. 408.70  Change from quarterly to monthly payments.

    If an enrollee requests change from quarterly to monthly payment--
    (a) If the enrollee is paid up under the quarterly cycle, the first 
monthly bill is for one month.
    (b) If the enrollee is not paid up under the quarter system, the 
first bill includes all premiums due.


<R05>
Sec. 408.71  Change from deduction or State payment to direct remittance.

    (a) Basis for change. An SMI enrollee is required to pay by direct 
remittance in any of the following circumstances:
    (1) The enrollee's entitlement to social security or railroad 
retirement benefits ends for any reason other than death.
    (2) The premiums can no longer be deducted from the civil service 
annuity of the enrollee or the enrollee's spouse.
    (3) The enrollee no longer qualifies for coverage under a State buy-
in agreement, and is not entitled to social security or railroad 
retirement monthly benefits.
    (b) Billing. When any of the events specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section occurs (or as soon thereafter as possible), HCFA or its 
agents bill the enrollee for direct remittance, in accordance with this 
subpart.


<R04>
               Subpart E--Direct Remittance: Group Payment


<R05>
Sec. 408.80  Basic rules.

    (a) Sources of group payment. An employer, a lodge, union, or other 
organization may pay SMI premiums on behalf of one or more enrollees.
    (b) Informal arrangement. Enrollees may turn over their premium 
notices to their employer, union, lodge, or other organization and that 
organization may send a single payment (with the premium notices 
attached so that the payments can readily be identified with the 
appropriate enrollees) to the HCFA Premium Collection Center. Prompt 
payment is essential since SMI coverage terminates if premiums are not 
paid by the end of the grace period.
    (c) Group billing arrangement. HCFA may send a single notice for the 
premiums due from a group of enrollees if the following conditions are 
met:
    (1) The group payer--
    (i) Uses funds other than the enrollees' to pay all or a substantial 
part of the premiums; or

[[Page 175]]

    (ii) Deducts the premiums from periodic payments it makes to the 
enrollees in the group.
    (2) The enrollee's rights are protected and enrollees are not 
required to pay the costs of having their premiums paid on a group 
basis.


<R05>
Sec. 408.82  Conditions for group billing.

    HCFA agrees to a group billing arrangement only if the following 
conditions are met:
    (a) Conditions the group payer must meet. The group payer submits a 
written request for group billing--
    (1) Showing that all or part of the payments are made from the 
payer's funds or from funds due the enrollees and in the payer's 
possession; and
    (2) Agreeing not to charge the enrollees for the service of paying 
the premiums or for the administrative costs such as recordkeeping and 
postage.
    (b) Enrollees eligible for group payment. (1) Group payment may be 
made only on behalf of individuals who are already enrolled and are 
being billed for direct remittance.
    (2) Group payment may not be made for enrollees whose premiums are 
being deducted from monthly benefits in accordance with Subpart C of 
this part or being paid by the State under a buy-in agreement.
    (c) Protection of enrollee's rights. The use of group billing must 
not jeopardize the enrollees' right--
    (1) To confidentiality of personal information;
    (2) To terminate enrollment;
    (3) To resume individual payment of premiums if he or she wishes; 
and
    (4) To receive notice of any action that affects the SMI benefits.
    (d) Authorization by the enrollee. (1) To ensure maximum feasible 
protection of the rights specified in paragraph (c) of this section, 
each enrollee must give written authorization as specified in 
Sec. 408.84(a)(2).
    (2) A group payer that is not an entity of State or local government 
must submit all enrollee authorizations to HCFA.
    (3) A group payer that is an entity of State or local government may 
retain the authorizations and certify to HCFA that it has on file an 
authorization for each enrollee included in the group.
    (4) It is on the basis of the enrollee's authorization that HCFA 
sends the group payer information about each enrollee, as necessary to 
carry out the group payment function.
    (e) Size of group. The number of enrollees must be at least 20, 
which is the minimum size sufficient to make group billing efficient. 
(Smaller groups may use the informal procedure described in 
Sec. 408.80(b).)


<R05>
Sec. 408.84  Billing and payment procedures.

    (a) Initial premium notice. (1) HCFA or its agent always sends the 
initial premium notice to the enrollee.
    (2) An enrollee who wishes to have the premiums paid on a group 
basis must give the notice to the group payer, along with written 
authorization for sending subsequent notices to the group payer and for 
release of the information required for the group payment process.
    (b) Monthly billings. Group premiums are billed on a monthly basis. 
However, the group payer may pay up to 12 months in advance.
    (c) Group payers must make their payments within 30 days after 
billing, to avoid infringing on the 90-day grace period during which the 
premiums may be paid by the enrollee if he or she is dropped from the 
group.
    (d) Effect of group payment. Payment by a group payer is considered 
payment by the enrollee.


<R05>
Sec. 408.86  Responsibilities under group billing arrangement.

    (a) Enrollee responsibilities. (1) The enrollee is still responsible 
for premium payments; the group payer simply acts as his agent. If the 
agent fails to pay, or identifies the payment incorrectly, SSA notifies 
both the agent and the enrollee that the enrollee's account is 
delinquent. If an enrollee fails to take action on that notice, 
entitlement is terminated for nonpayment of premiums.
    (2) The enrollee must promptly notify both SSA and the group payer 
of any change of address.
    (b) Group payer's responsibilities. The group payer must--
    (1) Make premium payments promptly upon receipt of notices;

[[Page 176]]

    (2) Promptly notify both HCFA and the enrollee when it drops an 
enrollee from the group;
    (3) Make payments in a way that facilitates efficient and economical 
processing; and
    (4) Maintain the confidentiality of the personal information 
obtained from HCFA for the group payment process.
    (c) HCFA responsibilities. HCFA--
    (1) Sends the bill to the group payer upon authorization from the 
enrollee;
    (2) Notifies both the payer and the enrollee if the payer fails to 
make timely payments; and
    (3) Refunds excess premiums in accordance with Sec. 408.88.


<R05>
Sec. 408.88  Refund of group payments.

    (a) Basis for refund. Group payments are refunded only in the 
following circumstances:
    (1) The premium was for a month after the month in which the 
enrollee's SMI coverage terminated or the enrollee died.
    (2) The premium was for a month after the month in which the group 
payer gave notice (before the 26th day of that month) that the enrollee 
was no longer eligible for group payment and was being dropped from the 
group.
    (b) Example. F is the wife of J who is a retiree of Corporation X. 
That corporation pays premiums on behalf of all of its retirees and 
their dependents. F obtains a divorce from J on October 20 and thus 
disqualifies herself for further premium payments by the corporation. 
The corporation gives notice on November 10 that a refund is due because 
F has been dropped from the list of persons for whom it has agreed to 
pay premiums. The premium paid for December would be refunded to the 
group payer.
    (c) To whom refund is made. (1) HCFA ordinarily refunds to the group 
payer the premiums specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) However, if HCFA has information that clearly shows those 
premiums were paid from the enrollee's funds, it sends the refund to the 
enrollee.


<R05>
Sec. 408.90  Termination of group billing arrangement.

    (a) A group billing arrangement may be terminated either by the 
group payer or by HCFA upon 30 days' notice.
    (b) HCFA may terminate the arrangement if it finds that the group 
payer is not acting in the best interest of the enrollees or that, for 
any other reason, the arrangement has proved inconvenient for HCFA.


<R05>
Sec. 408.92  Change from group payment to deduction or individual payment.

    (a) Enrollee excluded from group payment arrangement because of 
entitlement to monthly benefits. (1) When an enrollee becomes entitled 
to monthly benefits from which premiums can be deducted as specified in 
subpart C of this part, HCFA notifies the group payer to discontinue 
payment for that enrollee.
    (2) In order to maintain confidentiality, HCFA does not explain to 
the group payer the reason for excluding the enrollee from the group 
payment arrangement.
    (3) The enrollee's premiums are thereafter deducted from the monthly 
benefits, in accordance with subpart C of this part.
    (b) Enrollee no longer eligible for the group. (1) When an enrollee 
is no longer eligible to be included in the group (for instance because 
he or she is no longer employed by the group payer or has terminated 
union or lodge membership), the group payer must promptly notify HCFA 
and the enrollee.
    (2) HCFA or its agents resume sending individual bills to the 
enrollee, for direct remittance subject to the grace period and 
termination dates specified in Sec. 408.8.


<R04>
          Subpart F--Termination and Reinstatement of Coverage


<R05>
Sec. 408.100  Termination of coverage for nonpayment of premiums.

    (a) Effective date of termination. Termination is effective on the 
last day of the grace period. The determination is not made until 15 
days after that day to allow for processing of remittances mailed late 
in the grace period, as provided in Sec. 408.68.

[[Page 177]]

    (b) Notice of termination. (1) SSA sends the enrollee notice of 
termination between 15 and 30 days after the end of the grace period and 
includes information regarding the enrollee's right of appeal.
    (2) HCFA notifies any intermediary or carrier that had previously 
been informed that the enrollee had met the SMI deductible for the year 
in which the termination is effective.


<R05>
Sec. 408.102  Reconsideration of termination.

    (a) Basic rules. Coverage may be reinstated without interruption of 
benefits if the following conditions are met:
    (1) The enrollee appeals the termination by the end of the month 
following the month in which SSA sent the notice of termination.
    (2) The enrollee alleges and it is found that the enrollee did not 
receive timely and adequate notice that the premiums were overdue.
    (3) The enrollee pays, within 30 days after SSA's subsequent request 
for payment, all premiums due through the month in which he or she 
appealed the termination.
    (b) Basis for reinstating coverage. Coverage may be reinstated if 
the evidence establishes one of the following:
    (1) The enrollee acted diligently to pay the premiums or to request 
relief upon receiving a premium notice very late in the grace period or 
shortly after its end, and the delayed notice was not the enrollee's 
fault. (For example, if the billing notice was misaddressed or lost in 
the mail, it would not be the enrollee's fault; if the enrollee had 
moved and not notified SSA of the new address, he or she would be 
responsible for the delay.)
    (2) On the basis of information given by SSA, the enrollee could 
reasonably have believed that the premiums were being paid by deduction 
from benefits or by some other means. (An example would be a notice 
indicating that premiums would be paid by a State Medicaid agency or a 
group payer or would be deducted from the spouse's civil service 
annuity.)
    (c) No basis for reinstating coverage. Coverage may not be 
reinstated if the enrollee--
    (1) Received timely and adequate notice but failed to pay within the 
grace period, for example because of insufficient income or resources; 
or
    (2) Appealed the termination more than one month after the month in 
which SSA sent the termination notice.


<R05>
Sec. 408.104  Reinstatement procedures.

    (a) Request for payment. If the conditions of Sec. 408.102(a) (1) 
and (2) are met, SSA sends written notice requesting the enrollee to 
pay, within 30 days, all premiums due through the month in which the 
enrollee appealed the termination.
    (b) Reinstatement of coverage. If SSA receives the requested payment 
within 30 days, it sets aside the termination and reinstates the 
enrollee's coverage without interruption.


<R04>
  Subpart G--Collection of Unpaid Premiums; Refund of Excess Premiums 
                     After the Death of the Enrollee


<R05>
Sec. 408.110  Collection of unpaid premiums.

    (a) Basis and scope--(1) Basis. Under the Federal Claims Collection 
Act of 1966 (31 U.S.C. 3711), HCFA is required to collect any debts due 
it but is authorized to suspend or terminate collection action on debts 
of less than $20,000 when certain conditions are met. (See 4 CFR, parts 
101-105 for general rules implementing the Federal Claims Collection 
Act.) As indicated in Sec. 408.4, unpaid premiums are debts owed the 
Federal government by the enrollee or the enrollee's estate.
    (2) Scope. This section sets forth the methods of collection used by 
HCFA and the circumstances under which HCFA terminates or renews 
collection action. The regulations in this section apply to hospital

    (a) Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, Medicare 
pays for supplies, appliances, and equipment as posthospital SNF care 
only if--
    (1) They are ordinarily furnished by the facility to inpatients; and
    (2) They are furnished to inpatients for use in the facility.
    (b) Exception. Medicare pays for items to be used after the 
individual leaves the facility if--
    (1) The item is one that the beneficiary must continue to use after 
leaving, such as a leg brace; or
    (2) The item is necessary to permit or facilitate the beneficiary's 
departure from the facility and is required until he or she can obtain a 
continuing supply. Sterile dressings would be an example.


<R05>
Sec. 409.26  Services furnished by an intern or a resident-in-training.

    Medicare pays for medical services furnished by an intern or a 
resident-in-training as posthospital SNF care if--
    (a) The intern or resident is in a participating hospital with which 
the SNF has in effect an agreement for the transfer of patients and 
exchange of medical records or in a hospital that has a swing-bed 
approval; and
    (b) The intern or resident furnishes the services under a hospital 
teaching program approved in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 409.15.


<R05>
Sec. 409.27  Other diagnostic or therapeutic services.

    Medicare pays for other diagnostic or therapeutic services as 
posthospital SNF care if they are provided by a participating hospital 
with which the SNF has in effect an agreement for the transfer of 
patients and exchange of clinical records, or by a hospital or a CAH 
that has a swing-bed approval.

or CAH that has a swing-bed approval, is covered only if the beneficiary 
meets the requirements of this section and only for days when he or she 
needs and receives care of the level described in Sec. 409.31.
    (a) Pre-admission requirements. The beneficiary must--
    (1) Have been hospitalized in a participating or qualified hospital 
or participating CAH, for medically necessary inpatient hospital or 
inpatient CAH care, for at least 3 consecutive calendar days, not 
counting the date of discharge; and
    (2) Have been discharged from the hospital or CAH in or after the 
month he or she attained age 65, or in a month for which he or she was 
entitled to hospital or CAH insurance benefits on the basis of 
disability or end-stage renal disease, in accordance with part 406 of 
this chapter.
    (b) Date of admission requirements.<SUP>1</SUP> (1) Except as 
specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the beneficiary must be 
in need of posthospital SNF care, be admitted to the facility, and 
receive the needed care within 30 calendar days after the date of 
discharge from a hospital or CAH.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>1</SUP> Before December 5, 1980, the law required that 
admission and receipt of care be within 14 days after discharge from the 
hospital or CAH and permitted admission up to 28 days after discharge if 
a SNF bed was not available in the geographic area in which the patient 
lived, or at the time it would be medically appropriate to begin an 
active course of treatment, if SNF care would not be medically 
appropriate within 14 days after discharge.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Exception. A beneficiary for whom posthospital SNF care would 
not be medically appropriate within 30 days after discharge from the 
hospital or CAH may be admitted at the time it would be medically 
appropriate to begin an active course of treatment.

<R05>
Sec. 409.31  Level of care requirement.

    (a) Definition. As used in this section, skilled nursing and skilled 
rehabilitation services means services that:
    (1) Are ordered by a physician;
    (2) Require the skills of technical or professional personnel such 
as registered nurses, licensed practical (vocational) nurses, physical 
therapists, occupational therapists, and speech pathologists or 
audiologists; and
    (3) Are furnished directly by, or under the supervision of, such 
personnel.
    (b) Specific conditions for meeting level of care requirements. (1) 
The beneficiary must require skilled nursing or skilled rehabilitation 
services, or both, on a daily basis.
    (2) Those services must be furnished for a condition--
    (i) For which the beneficiary received inpatient hospital or 
inpatient CAH services; or
    (ii) Which arose while the beneficiary was receiving care in a SNF 
or swing-bed hospital for a condition for which he or she received 
inpatient hospital or inpatient CAH services.
    (3) The daily skilled services must be ones that, as a practical 
matter, can only be provided in a SNF, on an inpatient basis.

[48 FR 12541, Mar. 25, 1983, as amended at 58 FR 30666, May 26, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 409.32  Criteria for skilled services and the need for skilled services.

    (a) To be considered a skilled service, the service must be so 
inherently complex that it can be safely and effectively performed only 
by, or under the supervision of, professional or technical personnel.
    (b) A condition that does not ordinarily require skilled services 
may require them because of special medical complications. Under those 
circumstances, a service that is usually nonskilled (such as those 
listed in Sec. 409.33(d)) may be considered skilled because it must be 
performed or supervised by skilled nursing or rehabilitation personnel. 
For example, a plaster cast on a leg does not usually require skilled 
care. However, if the patient has a preexisting acute skin condition or 
needs traction, skilled personnel may be needed to adjust traction or 
watch for complications. In situations of this type, the complications, 
and the skilled services they require, must be documented by physicians' 
orders and nursing or therapy notes.

[[Page 186]]

    (c) The restoration potential of a patient is not the deciding 
factor in determining whether skilled services are needed. Even if full 
recovery or medical improvement is not possible, a patient may need 
skilled services to prevent further deterioration or preserve current 
capabilities. For example, a terminal cancer patient may need some of 
the skilled services described in Sec. 409.33.

[48 FR 12541, Mar. 25, 1983, as amended at 59 FR 65493, Dec. 20, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 409.33  Examples of skilled nursing and rehabilitation services.

    (a) Services that could qualify as either skilled nursing or skilled 
rehabilitation services. (1) Overall management and evaluation of care 
plan. The development, management, and evaluation of a patient care plan 
based on the physician's orders constitute skilled services when, 
because of the patient's physical or mental condition, those activities 
require the involvement of technical or professional personnel in order 
to meet the patient's needs, promote recovery, and ensure medical 
safety. This would include the management of a plan involving only a 
variety of personal care services when, in light of the patient's 
condition, the aggregate of those services requires the involvement of 
technical or professional personnel. For example, an aged patient with a 
history of diabetes mellitus and angina pectoris who is recovering from 
an open reduction of a fracture of the neck of the femur requires, among 
other services, careful skin care, appropriate oral medications, a 
diabetic diet, an exercise program to preserve muscle tone and body 
condition, and observation to detect signs of deterioration in his or 
her condition or complications resulting from restricted, but 
increasing, mobility. Although any of the required services could be 
performed by a properly instructed person, such a person would not have 
the ability to understand the relationship between the services and 
evaluate the ultimate effect of one service on the other. Since the 
nature of the patient's condition, age, and immobility create a high 
potential for serious complications, such an understanding is essential 
to ensure the patient's recovery and safety. Under these circumstances, 
the management of the plan of care would require the skills of a nurse 
even though the individual services are not skilled. Skilled planning 
and management activities are not always specifically identified in the 
patient's clinical record. Therefore, if the patient's overall condition 
would support a finding that recovery and safety can be assured only if 
the total care is planned, managed, and evaluated by technical or 
professional personnel, it would be appropriate to infer that skilled 
services are being provided.
    (2) Observation and assessment of the patient's changing condition. 
Observation and assessment constitute skilled services when the skills 
of a technical or professional person are required to identify and 
evaluate the patient's need for modification of treatment for additional 
medical procedures until his or her condition is stabilized. For 
example, a patient with congestive heart failure may require continuous 
close observation to detect signs of decompensation, abnormal fluid 
balance, or adverse effects resulting from prescribed medication(s) 
which serve as indicators for adjusting therapeutic measures. Likewise, 
surgical patients transferred from a hospital to a skilled nursing 
facility while in the complicated, unstabilized postoperative period, 
e.g., after hip prosthesis or cataract surgery, may need continued close 
skilled monitoring for postoperative complications, and adverse 
reaction. Patients who, in addition to their physical problems, exhibit 
acute psychological symptoms such as depression, anxiety, or agitation, 
etc., may also require skilled observation and assessment by technical 
or professional personnel to assure their safety and/or the safety of 
others, i.e., to observe for indications of suicidal or hostile 
behavior. The need for services of this type must be documented by 
physicians' orders and/or nursing or therapy notes.
    (3) Patient education services. Patient education services are 
skilled services if the use of technical or professional personnel is 
necessary to teach a patient self-maintenance. For example, a patient 
who has had a recent leg amputation needs skilled rehabilitation

[[Page 187]]

services provided by technical or professional personnel to provide gait 
training and to teach prosthesis care. Likewise, a patient newly 
diagnosed with diabetes requires instruction from technical or 
professional personnel to learn the self-administration of insulin or 
foot-care precautions, etc.
    (b) Services that qualify as skilled nursing services. (1) 
Intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous injections and 
hypodermoclysis or intravenous feeding;
    (2) Levin tube and gastrostomy feedings;
    (3) Nasopharyngeal and tracheostomy aspiration;
    (4) Insertion and sterile irrigation and replacement of catheters;
    (5) Application of dressings involving prescription medications and 
aseptic techniques;
    (6) Treatment of extensive decubitus ulcers or other widespread skin 
disorder;
    (7) Heat treatments which have been specifically ordered by a 
physician as part of active treatment and which require observation by 
nurses to adequately evaluate the patient's progress;
    (8) Initial phases of a regimen involving administration of medical 
gases;
    (9) Rehabilitation nursing procedures, including the related 
teaching and adaptive aspects of nursing, that are part of active 
treatment, e.g., the institution and supervision of bowel and bladder 
training programs.
    (c) Services which would qualify as skilled rehabilitation services. 
(1) Ongoing assessment of rehabilitation needs and potential: Services 
concurrent with the management of a patient care plan, including tests 
and measurements of range of motion, strength, balance, coordination, 
endurance, functional ability, activities of daily living, perceptual 
deficits, speech and language or hearing disorders;
    (2) Therapeutic exercises or activities: Therapeutic exercises or 
activities which, because of the type of exercises employed or the 
condition of the patient, must be performed by or under the supervision 
of a qualified physical therapist or occupational therapist to ensure 
the safety of the patient and the effectiveness of the treatment;
    (3) Gait evaluation and training: Gait evaluation and training 
furnished to restore function in a patient whose ability to walk has 
been impaired by neurological, muscular, or skeletal abnormality;
    (4) Range of motion exercises: Range of motion exercises which are 
part of the active treatment of a specific disease state which has 
resulted in a loss of, or restriction of, mobility (as evidenced by a 
therapist's notes showing the degree of motion lost and the degree to be 
restored);
    (5) Maintenance therapy; Maintenance therapy, when the specialized 
knowledge and judgment of a qualified therapist is required to design 
and establish a maintenance program based on an initial evaluation and 
periodic reassessment of the patient's needs, and consistent with the 
patient's capacity and tolerance. For example, a patient with 
Parkinson's disease who has not been under a rehabilitation regimen may 
require the services of a qualified therapist to determine what type of 
exercises will contribute the most to the maintenance of his present 
level of functioning.
    (6) Ultrasound, short-wave, and microwave therapy treatment by a 
qualified physical therapist;
    (7) Hot pack, hydrocollator, infrared treatments, paraffin baths, 
and whirlpool; Hot pack hydrocollator, infrared treatments, paraffin 
baths, and whirlpool in particular cases where the patient's condition 
is complicated by circulatory deficiency, areas of desensitization, open 
wounds, fractures, or other complications, and the skills, knowledge, 
and judgment of a qualified physical therapist are required; and
    (8) Services of a speech pathologist or audiologist when necessary 
for the restoration of function in speech or hearing.
    (d) Personal care services. Personal care services which do not 
require the skills of qualified technical or professional personnel are 
not skilled services except under the circumstances specified in 
Sec. 409.32(b). Personal care services include, but are not limited to, 
the following:
    (1) Administration of routine oral medications, eye drops, and 
ointments;

[[Page 188]]

    (2) General maintenance care of colostomy and ileostomy;
    (3) Routine services to maintain satisfactory functioning of 
indwelling bladder catheters;
    (4) Changes of dressings for noninfected postoperative or chronic 
conditions;
    (5) Prophylactic and palliative skin care, including bathing and 
application of creams, or treatment of minor skin problems;
    (6) Routine care of the incontinent patient, including use of 
diapers and protective sheets;
    (7) General maintenance care in connection with a plaster cast;
    (8) Routine care in connection with braces and similar devices;
    (9) Use of heat as a palliative and comfort measure, such as 
whirlpool and hydrocollator;
    (10) Routine administration of medical gases after a regimen of 
therapy has been established;
    (11) Assistance in dressing, eating, and going to the toilet;
    (12) Periodic turning and positioning in bed; and
    (13) General supervision of exercises which have been taught to the 
patient; including the actual carrying out of maintenance programs, 
i.e., the performance of the repetitive exercises required to maintain 
function do not require the skills of a therapist and would not 
constitute skilled rehabilitation services (see paragraph (c) of this 
section). Similarly, repetitious exercises to improve gait, maintain 
strength, or endurance; passive exercises to maintain range of motion in 
paralyzed extremities, which are not related to a specific loss of 
function; and assistive walking do not constitute skilled rehabilitation 
services.


<R05>
Sec. 409.34  Criteria for ``daily basis''.

    (a) To meet the daily basis requirement specified in 
Sec. 409.31(b)(1), the following frequency is required:
    (1) Skilled nursing services or skilled rehabilitation services must 
be needed and provided 7 days a week; or
    (2) As an exception, if skilled rehabilitation services are not 
available 7 days a week those services must be needed and provided at 
least 5 days a week.
    (b) A break of one or two days in the furnishing of rehabilitation 
services will not preclude coverage if discharge would not be practical 
for the one or two days during which, for instance, the physician has 
suspended the therapy sessions because the patient exhibited extreme 
fatigue.


<R05>
Sec. 409.35  Criteria for ``practical matter''.

    (a) General considerations. In making a ``practical matter'' 
determination, as required by Sec. 409.31(b)(3), consideration must be 
given to the patient's condition and to the availability and feasibility 
of using more economical alternative facilities and services. However, 
in making that determination, the availability of Medicare payment for 
those services may not be a factor. Example: The beneficiary can obtain 
daily physical therapy from a physical therapist in independent 
practice. However, Medicare pays only the appropriate portion (after 
deduction of applicable deductible and coinsurance amounts) of the first 
$500 of services furnished by such a practitioner in a year. This 
limitation on payment may not be a basis for finding that the needed 
care can only be provided in a SNF.
    (b) Examples of circumstances that meet practical matter criteria. 
(1) Beneficiary's condition. Inpatient care would be required ``as a 
practical matter'' if transporting the beneficiary to and from the 
nearest facility that furnishes the required daily skilled services 
would be an excessive physical hardship.
    (2) Economy and efficiency. Even if the beneficiary's condition does 
not preclude transportation, inpatient care might be more efficient and 
less costly if, for instance, the only alternative is daily 
transportation by ambulance.

Sec. 409.36  Effect of discharge from posthospital SNF care.

    If a beneficiary is discharged from a facility after receiving 
posthospital SNF care, he or she is not entitled to additional services 
of this kind in the same benefit period unless--
    (a) He or she is readmitted to the same or another facility within 
30 calendar days following the day of discharge (or, before December 5, 
1980,

[[Page 189]]

within 14 calendar days after discharge); or
    (b) He or she is again hospitalized for at least 3 consecutive 
calendar days.

<R05>
Sec. 409.42  Beneficiary qualifications for coverage of services.

    To qualify for Medicare coverage of home health services, a 
beneficiary must meet each of the following requirements:
    (a) Confined to the home. The beneficiary must be confined to the 
home or in an institution that is not a hospital, SNF or nursing 
facility as defined in section 1861(e)(1), 1819(a)(1) or 1919(a)(1) of 
the Act, respectively.
    (b) Under the care of a physician. The beneficiary must be under the 
care of a physician who establishes the plan of care. A doctor of 
podiatric medicine may establish a plan of care only if that is 
consistent with the functions he or she is authorized to perform under 
State law.
    (c) In need of skilled services. The beneficiary must need at least 
one of the following skilled services as certified by a physician in 
accordance with the physician certification and recertification 
requirements for home health services under Sec. 424.22 of this chapter.
    (1) Intermittent skilled nursing services that meet the criteria for 
skilled services and the need for skilled services found in Sec. 409.32. 
(Also see Sec. 409.33(a) and (b) for a description of examples of 
skilled nursing and rehabilitation services.)
    (2) Physical therapy services that meet the requirements of 
Sec. 409.44(c).
    (3) Speech-language pathology services that meet the requirements of 
Sec. 409.44(c).
    (4) Continuing occupational therapy services that meet the 
requirements of Sec. 409.44(c) if the beneficiary's eligibility for home 
health services has been established by virtue of a prior need for 
intermittent skilled nursing care, speech-language pathology services, 
or physical therapy in the current or prior certification period.
    (d) Under a plan of care. The beneficiary must be under a plan of 
care that meets the requirements for plans of care specified in 
Sec. 409.43.
    (e) By whom the services must be furnished. The home health services 
must be furnished by, or under arrangements made by, a participating 
HHA.

<R05>
Sec. 409.43  Plan of care requirements.

    (a) Contents. The plan of care must contain those items listed in 
Sec. 484.18(a) of this chapter that specify the standards relating to a 
plan of care that an HHA must meet in order to participate in the 
Medicare program.
    (b) Physician's orders. The physician's orders for services in the 
plan of care must specify the medical treatments to be furnished as well 
as the type of home health discipline that will furnish the ordered 
services and at what frequency the services will be furnished. Orders 
for services to be provided ``as needed'' or ``PRN'' must be accompanied 
by a description of the

[[Page 190]]

beneficiary's medical signs and symptoms that would occasion the visit 
and a specific limit on the number of those visits to be made under the 
order before an additional physician order would have to be obtained. 
Orders for care may indicate a specific range in frequency of visits to 
ensure that the most appropriate level of services is furnished. If a 
range of visits is ordered, the upper limit of the range is considered 
the specific frequency.
    (c) Physician signature. The plan of care must be signed and dated 
by a physician who meets the certification and recertification 
requirements of Sec. 424.22 of this chapter. The plan of care must be 
signed by the physician before the bill for services is submitted. Any 
changes in the plan must be signed and dated by the physician.
    (d) Oral (verbal) orders. If any services are provided based on a 
physician's oral orders, the orders must be put in writing and be signed 
and dated with the date of receipt by the registered nurse or qualified 
therapist (as defined in Sec. 484.4 of this chapter) responsible for 
furnishing or supervising the ordered services. Oral orders may only be 
accepted by personnel authorized to do so by applicable State and 
Federal laws and regulations as well as by the HHA's internal policies. 
The oral orders must also be countersigned and dated by the physician 
before the HHA bills for the care.
    (e) Frequency of review. The plan of care must be reviewed by the 
physician (as specified in Sec. 409.42(b)) in consultation with agency 
professional personnel at least every 62 days. Each review of a 
beneficiary's plan of care must contain the signature of the physician 
who reviewed it and the date of review.
    (f) Termination of the plan of care. The plan of care is considered 
to be terminated if the beneficiary does not receive at least one 
covered skilled nursing, physical therapy, speech-language pathology 
services, or occupational therapy visit in a 62-day period unless the 
physician documents that the interval without such care is appropriate 
to the treatment of the beneficiary's illness or injury.

[59 FR 65494, Dec. 20, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 409.44  Skilled services requirements.

    (a) General. The intermediary's decision on whether care is 
reasonable and necessary is based on information provided on the forms 
and in the medical record concerning the unique medical condition of the 
individual beneficiary. A coverage denial is not made solely on the 
basis of the reviewer's general inferences about patients with similar 
diagnoses or on data related to utilization generally but is based upon 
objective clinical evidence regarding the beneficiary's individual need 
for care.
    (b) Skilled nursing care. (1) Skilled nursing care consists of those 
services that must, under State law, be performed by a registered nurse, 
or practical (vocational) nurse, as defined in Sec. 484.4 of this 
chapter, and meet the criteria for skilled nursing services specified in 
Sec. 409.32. See Sec. 409.33(a) and (b) for a description of skilled 
nursing services and examples of them.
    (i) In determining whether a service requires the skill of a 
licensed nurse, consideration must be given to the inherent complexity 
of the service, the condition of the beneficiary, and accepted standards 
of medical and nursing practice.
    (ii) If the nature of a service is such that it can safely and 
effectively be performed by the average nonmedical person without direct 
supervision of a licensed nurse, the service cannot be regarded as a 
skilled nursing service.
    (iii) The fact that a skilled nursing service can be or is taught to 
the beneficiary or to the beneficiary's family or friends does not 
negate the skilled aspect of the service when performed by the nurse.
    (iv) If the service could be performed by the average nonmedical 
person, the absence of a competent person to perform it does not cause 
it to be a skilled nursing service.
    (2) The skilled nursing care must be provided on a part-time or 
intermittent basis.
    (3) The skilled nursing services must be reasonable and necessary 
for the treatment of the illness or injury.
    (i) To be considered reasonable and necessary, the services must be 
consistent with the nature and severity of the beneficiary's illness or 
injury, his or her particular medical needs, and

[[Page 191]]

accepted standards of medical and nursing practice.
    (ii) The skilled nursing care provided to the beneficiary must be 
reasonable within the context of the beneficiary's condition.
    (iii) The determination of whether skilled nursing care is 
reasonable and necessary must be based solely upon the beneficiary's 
unique condition and individual needs, without regard to whether the 
illness or injury is acute, chronic, terminal, or expected to last a 
long time.
    (c) Physical therapy, speech-language pathology services, and 
occupational therapy. To be covered, physical therapy, speech-language 
pathology services, and occupational therapy must satisfy the criteria 
in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section. Occupational therapy 
services initially qualify for home health coverage only if they are 
part of a plan of care that also includes intermittent skilled nursing 
care, physical therapy, or speech-language pathology services as 
follows:
    (1) Speech-language pathology services and physical or occupational 
therapy services must relate directly and specifically to a treatment 
regimen (established by the physician, after any needed consultation 
with the qualified therapist) that is designed to treat the 
beneficiary's illness or injury. Services related to activities for the 
general physical welfare of beneficiaries (for example, exercises to 
promote overall fitness) do not constitute physical therapy, 
occupational therapy, or speech-language pathology services for Medicare 
purposes.
    (2) Physical and occupational therapy and speech-language pathology 
services must be reasonable and necessary. To be considered reasonable 
and necessary, the following conditions must be met:
    (i) The services must be considered under accepted standards of 
medical practice to be a specific, safe, and effective treatment for the 
beneficiary's condition.
    (ii) The services must be of such a level of complexity and 
sophistication or the condition of the beneficiary must be such that the 
services required can safely and effectively be performed only by a 
qualified physical therapist or by a qualified physical therapy 
assistant under the supervision of a qualified physical therapist, by a 
qualified speech-language pathologist, or by a qualified occupational 
therapist or a qualified occupational therapy assistant under the 
supervision of a qualified occupational therapist (as defined in 
Sec. 484.4 of this chapter). Services that do not require the 
performance or supervision of a physical therapist or an occupational 
therapist are not considered reasonable or necessary physical therapy or 
occupational therapy services, even if they are performed by or 
supervised by a physical therapist or occupational therapist. Services 
that do not require the skills of a speech-language pathologist are not 
considered to be reasonable and necessary speech-language pathology 
services even if they are performed by or supervised by a speech-
language pathologist.
    (iii) There must be an expectation that the beneficiary's condition 
will improve materially in a reasonable (and generally predictable) 
period of time based on the physician's assessment of the beneficiary's 
restoration potential and unique medical condition, or the services must 
be necessary to establish a safe and effective maintenance program 
required in connection with a specific disease, or the skills of a 
therapist must be necessary to perform a safe and effective maintenance 
program. If the services are for the establishment of a maintenance 
program, they may include the design of the program, the instruction of 
the beneficiary, family, or home health aides, and the necessary 
infrequent reevaluations of the beneficiary and the program to the 
degree that the specialized knowledge and judgment of a physical 
therapist, speech-language pathologist, or occupational therapist is 
required.
    (iv) The amount, frequency, and duration of the services must be 
reasonable.

Sec. 409.45  Dependent services requirements.

    (a) General. Services discussed in paragraphs (b) through (g) of 
this section may be covered only if the beneficiary needs skilled 
nursing care on an

[[Page 192]]

intermittent basis, as described in Sec. 409.44(b); physical therapy or 
speech-language pathology services as described in Sec. 409.44(c); or 
has a continuing need for occupational therapy services as described in 
Sec. 409.44(c) if the beneficiary's eligibility for home health services 
has been established by virtue of a prior need for intermittent skilled 
nursing care, speech-language pathology services, or physical therapy in 
the current or prior certification period; and otherwise meets the 
qualifying criteria (confined to the home, under the care of a 
physician, in need of skilled services, and under a plan of care) 
specified in Sec. 409.42. Home health coverage is not available for 
services furnished to a beneficiary who is no longer in need of one of 
the qualifying skilled services specified in this paragraph. Therefore, 
dependent services furnished after the final qualifying skilled service 
are not covered, except when the dependent service was not followed by a 
qualifying skilled service as a result of the unexpected inpatient 
admission or death of the beneficiary, or due to some other 
unanticipated event.
    (b) Home health aide services. To be covered, home health aide 
services must meet each of the following requirements:
    (1) The reason for the visits by the home health aide must be to 
provide hands-on personal care to the beneficiary or services that are 
needed to maintain the beneficiary's health or to facilitate treatment 
of the beneficiary's illness or injury. The physician's order must 
indicate the frequency of the home health aide services required by the 
beneficiary. These services may include but are not limited to:
    (i) Personal care services such as bathing, dressing, grooming, 
caring for hair, nail and oral hygiene that are needed to facilitate 
treatment or to prevent deterioration of the beneficiary's health, 
changing the bed linens of an incontinent beneficiary, shaving, 
deodorant application, skin care with lotions and/or powder, foot care, 
ear care, feeding, assistance with elimination (including enemas unless 
the skills of a licensed nurse are required due to the beneficiary's 
condition, routine catheter care, and routine colostomy care), 
assistance with ambulation, changing position in bed, and assistance 
with transfers.
    (ii) Simple dressing changes that do not require the skills of a 
licensed nurse.
    (iii) Assistance with medications that are ordinarily self-
administered and that do not require the skills of a licensed nurse to 
be provided safely and effectively.
    (iv) Assistance with activities that are directly supportive of 
skilled therapy services but do not require the skills of a therapist to 
be safely and effectively performed, such as routine maintenance 
exercises and repetitive practice of functional communication skills to 
support speech-language pathology services.
    (v) Routine care of prosthetic and orthotic devices.
    (2) The services to be provided by the home health aide must be--
    (i) Ordered by a physician in the plan of care; and
    (ii) Provided by the home health aide on a part-time or intermittent 
basis.
    (3) The services provided by the home health aide must be reasonable 
and necessary. To be considered reasonable and necessary, the services 
must--
    (i) Meet the requirement for home health aide services in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section;
    (ii) Be of a type the beneficiary cannot perform for himself or 
herself; and
    (iii) Be of a type that there is no able or willing caregiver to 
provide, or, if there is a potential caregiver, the beneficiary is 
unwilling to use the services of that individual.
    (4) The home health aide also may perform services incidental to a 
visit that was for the provision of care as described in paragraphs 
(b)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section. For example, these incidental 
services may include changing bed linens, personal laundry, or preparing 
a light meal.
    (c) Medical social services. Medical social services may be covered 
if the following requirements are met:
    (1) The services are ordered by a physician and included in the plan 
of care.
    (2)(i) The services are necessary to resolve social or emotional 
problems that are expected to be an impediment

[[Page 193]]

to the effective treatment of the beneficiary's medical condition or to 
his or her rate of recovery.
    (ii) If these services are furnished to a beneficiary's family 
member or caregiver, they are furnished on a short-term basis and it can 
be demonstrated that the service is necessary to resolve a clear and 
direct impediment to the effective treatment of the beneficiary's 
medical condition or to his or her rate of recovery.
    (3) The frequency and nature of the medical social services are 
reasonable and necessary to the treatment of the beneficiary's 
condition.
    (4) The medical social services are furnished by a qualified social 
worker or qualified social work assistant under the supervision of a 
social worker as defined in Sec. 484.4 of this chapter.
    (5) The services needed to resolve the problems that are impeding 
the beneficiary's recovery require the skills of a social worker or a 
social work assistant under the supervision of a social worker to be 
performed safely and effectively.
    (d) Occupational therapy. Occupational therapy services that are not 
qualifying services under Sec. 409.44(c) are nevertheless covered as 
dependent services if the requirements of Sec. 409.44(c)(2)(i) through 
(iv), as to reasonableness and necessity, are met.
    (e) Durable medical equipment. Durable medical equipment in 
accordance with Sec. 410.38 of this chapter, which describes the scope 
and conditions of payment for durable medical equipment under Part B, 
may be covered under the home health benefit as either a Part A or Part 
B service. Durable medical equipment furnished by an HHA as a home 
health service is always covered by Part A if the beneficiary is 
entitled to Part A.
    (f) Medical supplies. Medical supplies (including catheters, 
catheter supplies, ostomy bags, and supplies relating to ostomy care but 
excluding drugs and biologicals) may be covered as a home health 
benefit. For medical supplies to be covered as a Medicare home health 
benefit, the medical supplies must be needed to treat the beneficiary's 
illness or injury that occasioned the home health care.
    (g) Intern and resident services. The medical services of interns 
and residents in training under an approved hospital teaching program 
are covered if the services are ordered by the physician who is 
responsible for the plan of care and the HHA is affiliated with or under 
the common control of the hospital furnishing the medical services.

Approved means--
    (1) Approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical 
Education;
    (2) In the case of an osteopathic hospital, approved by the 
Committee on Hospitals of the Bureau of Professional Education of the 
American Osteopathic Association;
    (3) In the case of an intern or resident-in-training in the field of 
dentistry, approved by the Council on Dental Education of the American 
Dental Association; or
    (4) In the case of an intern or resident-in-training in the field of 
podiatry, approved by the Council on Podiatric Medical Education of the 
American Podiatric Medical Association.

<R05>
Sec. 409.46  Allowable administrative costs.

    Services that are allowable as administrative costs but are not 
separately billable include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (a) Registered nurse initial evaluation visits. Initial evaluation 
visits by a registered nurse for the purpose of assessing a 
beneficiary's health needs, determining if the agency can meet those 
health needs, and formulating a plan of care for the beneficiary are 
allowable administrative costs. If a physician specifically orders that 
a particular skilled service be furnished during the evaluation in which 
the agency accepts the beneficiary for treatment and all other coverage 
criteria are met, the visit is billable as a skilled nursing visit. 
Otherwise it is considered to be an administrative cost.
    (b) Visits by registered nurses or qualified professionals for the 
supervision of home health aides. Visits by registered nurses or 
qualified professionals for the

[[Page 194]]

purpose of supervising home health aides as required at Sec. 484.36(d) 
of this chapter are allowable administrative costs. Only if the 
registered nurse or qualified professional visits the beneficiary for 
the purpose of furnishing care that meets the coverage criteria at 
Sec. 409.44, and the supervisory visit occurs simultaneously with the 
provision of covered care, is the visit billable as a skilled nursing or 
therapist's visit.
    (c) Respiratory care services. If a respiratory therapist is used to 
furnish overall training or consultative advice to an HHA's staff and 
incidentally provides respiratory therapy services to beneficiaries in 
their homes, the costs of the respiratory therapist's services are 
allowable as administrative costs. Visits by a respiratory therapist to 
a beneficiary's home are not separately billable. However, respiratory 
therapy services that are furnished as part of a plan of care by a 
skilled nurse or physical therapist and that constitute skilled care may 
be separately billed as skilled visits.
    (d) Dietary and nutrition personnel. If dieticians or nutritionists 
are used to provide overall training or consultative advice to HHA staff 
and incidentally provide dietetic or nutritional services to 
beneficiaries in their homes, the costs of these professional services 
are allowable as administrative costs. Visits by a dietician or 
nutritionist to a beneficiary's home are not separately billable.

[59 FR 65496, Dec. 20, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 409.47  Place of service requirements.

    To be covered, home health services must be furnished in either the 
beneficiary's home or an outpatient setting as defined in this section.
    (a) Beneficiary's home. A beneficiary's home is any place in which a 
beneficiary resides that is not a hospital, SNF, or nursing facility as 
defined in sections 1861(e)(1), 1819(a)(1), of 1919(a)(1) of the Act, 
respectively.
    (b) Outpatient setting. For purposes of coverage of home health 
services, an outpatient setting may include a hospital, SNF or a 
rehabilitation center with which the HHA has an arrangement in 
accordance with the requirements of Sec. 484.14(h) of this chapter and 
that is used by the HHA to provide services that either--
    (1) Require equipment that cannot be made available at the 
beneficiary's home; or
    (2) Are furnished while the beneficiary is at the facility to 
receive services requiring equipment described in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section.

[59 FR 65496, Dec. 20, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 409.48  Visits.

    (a) Number of allowable visits under Part A. To the extent that all 
coverage requirements specified in this subpart are met, payment may be 
made on behalf of eligible beneficiaries under Part A for an unlimited 
number of covered home health visits. All Medicare home health services 
are covered under hospital insurance unless there is no Part A 
entitlement.
    (b) Number of visits under Part B. To the extent that all coverage 
requirements specified in this subpart are met, payment may be made on 
behalf of eligible beneficiaries under Part B for an unlimited number of 
covered home health visits. Medicare home health services are covered 
under Part B only when the beneficiary is not entitled to coverage under 
Part A.
    (c) Definition of visit. A visit is an episode of personal contact 
with the beneficiary by staff of the HHA or others under arrangements 
with the HHA, for the purpose of providing a covered service.
    (1) Generally, one visit may be covered each time an HHA employee or 
someone providing home health services under arrangements enters the 
beneficiary's home and provides a covered service to a beneficiary who 
meets the criteria of Sec. 409.42 (confined to the home, under the care 
of a physician, in need of skilled services, and under a plan of care).
    (2) If the HHA furnishes services in an outpatient facility under 
arrangements with the facility, one visit may be covered for each type 
of service provided.
    (3) If two individuals are needed to provide a service, two visits 
may be covered. If two individuals are present, but only one is needed 
to provide the care, only one visit may be covered.

[[Page 195]]

    (4) A visit is initiated with the delivery of covered home health 
services and ends at the conclusion of delivery of covered home health 
services. In those circumstances in which all reasonable and necessary 
home health services cannot be provided in the course of a single visit, 
HHA staff or others providing services under arrangements with the HHA 
may remain at the beneficiary's residence between visits (for example, 
to provide non-covered services). However, if all covered services could 
be provided in the course of one visit, only one visit may be covered.

<R05>
Sec. 409.49  Excluded services.

    (a) Drugs and biologicals. Drugs and biologicals are excluded from 
payment under the Medicare home health benefit.
    (1) A drug is any chemical compound that may be used on or 
administered to humans or animals as an aid in the diagnosis, treatment 
or prevention of disease or other condition or for the relief of pain or 
suffering or to control or improve any physiological pathologic 
condition.
    (2) A biological is any medicinal preparation made from living 
organisms and their products including, but not limited to, serums, 
vaccines, antigens, and antitoxins.
    (b) Transportation. The transportation of beneficiaries, whether to 
receive covered care or for other purposes, is excluded from home health 
coverage. Costs of transportation of equipment, materials, supplies, or 
staff may be allowable as administrative costs, but no separate payment 
is made for them.
    (c) Services that would not be covered as inpatient services. 
Services that would not be covered if furnished as inpatient hospital 
services are excluded from home health coverage.
    (d) Housekeeping services. Services whose sole purpose is to enable 
the beneficiary to continue residing in his or her home (for example, 
cooking, shopping, Meals on Wheels, cleaning, laundry) are excluded from 
home health coverage.
    (e) Services covered under the End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) 
program. Services that are covered under the ESRD program and are 
contained in the composite rate reimbursement methodology, including any 
service furnished to a Medicare ESRD beneficiary that is directly 
related to that individual's dialysis, are excluded from coverage under 
the Medicare home health benefit.
    (f) Prosthetic devices. Items that meet the requirements of 
Sec. 410.36(a)(2) of this chapter for prosthetic devices covered under 
Part B are excluded from home health coverage. Catheters, catheter 
supplies, ostomy bags, and supplies relating to ostomy care are not 
considered prosthetic devices if furnished under a home health plan of 
care and are not subject to this exclusion from coverage.
    (g) Medical social services provided to family members. Except as 
provided in Sec. 409.45(c)(2), medical social services provided solely 
to members of the beneficiary's family and that are not incidental to 
covered medical social services being provided to the beneficiary are 
not covered.

             Subpart F--Scope of Hospital Insurance Benefits


<R05>
Sec. 409.60  Benefit periods.

    (a) When benefit periods begin. The initial benefit period begins on 
the day the beneficiary receives inpatient hospital, inpatient CAH, or 
SNF services for the first time after becoming entitled to hospital 
insurance. Thereafter, a new benefit period begins whenever the 
beneficiary receives inpatient hospital, inpatient CAH, or SNF services 
after he or she has ended a benefit period as described in paragraph (b) 
of this section.

[[Page 196]]

    (b) When benefit periods end--(1) A benefit period ends when a 
beneficiary has, for at least 60 consecutive days not been an inpatient 
in any of the following:
    (i) A hospital that meets the requirements of section 1861(e)(1) of 
the Act.
    (ii) A CAH that meets the requirements of section 1820 of the Act.
    (iii) A SNF that meets the requirements of sections 1819(a)(1) or 
1861(y) of the Act.
    (2) For purposes of ending a benefit period, a beneficiary was an 
inpatient of a SNF if his or her care in the SNF met the skilled level 
of care requirements specified in Sec. 409.31(b) (1) and (3).
    (c) Presumptions. (1) For purposes of determining whether a 
beneficiary was an inpatient of a SNF under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section--
    (i) A beneficiary's care met the skilled level of care requirements 
if inpatient SNF claims were paid for those services under Medicare or 
Medicaid, unless:
    (A) Such payments were made under Sec. 405.330 or Medicaid 
administratively necessary days provisions which result in payment for 
care not meeting the skilled level of care requirements, or
    (B) A Medicare denial and a Medicaid payment are made for the same 
period, in which case the presumption in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this 
section applies;
    (ii) A beneficiary's care met the skilled level of care requirements 
if a SNF claim was paid under section 1879(e) of the Social Security 
Act;
    (iii) A beneficiary's care did not meet the skilled level of care 
requirements if a SNF claim was paid for the services under 
Sec. 405.330;
    (iv) A beneficiary's care did not meet the skilled level of care 
requirements if a Medicaid SNF claim was denied on the grounds that the 
services were not at the skilled level of care (even if paid under 
applicable Medicaid administratively necessary days provisions which 
result in payment for care not meeting the skilled level of care 
requirements);
    (2) For purposes of determining whether a beneficiary was an 
inpatient of a SNF under paragraph (b)(2) of this section a 
beneficiary's care in a SNF is presumed--
    (i) To have met the skilled level of care requirements if a Medicaid 
or Medicare claim was denied on grounds other than that the services 
were not at the skilled level of care;
    (ii) Not to have met the skilled level of care requirements if a 
Medicare SNF claim was denied on the grounds that the services were not 
at the skilled level of care and payment was not made under 
Sec. 405.330; or
    (iii) Not to have met the skilled level of care requirements if no 
Medicare or Medicaid claim was submitted by the SNF.
    (3) If information upon which to base a presumption is not readily 
available, the intermediary may, at its discretion review the 
beneficiary's medical records to determine whether he or she was an 
inpatient of a SNF as set forth under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (4) When the intermediary makes a benefit period determination based 
upon paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the beneficiary may seek to 
reverse the benefit period determination by timely appealing the prior 
Medicare SNF claim determination under part 405, subpart G of this 
chapter, or the prior Medicaid SNF claim under part 431, subpart E of 
this chapter.
    (5) When the intermediary makes a benefit period determination under 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the beneficiary will be notified of 
the basis for the determination, and of his or her right to present 
evidence to rebut the determination that the skilled level of care 
requirements specified in Sec. 409.31 (b)(1) and (b)(3) were or were not 
met on reconsideration and appeal under 42 CFR, part 405, subpart G of 
this chapter.
    (d) Limitation on benefit period determinations. When the 
intermediary considers the same prior SNF stay of a particular 
beneficiary in making benefit period determinations for more than one 
inpatient Medicare claim--
    (1) Medicare will recognize only the initial level of care 
characterization for that prior SNF stay (or if appealed under 42 CFR 
part 405, subpart G of this chapter, the level of care determined under 
appeal); or
    (2) If part of a prior SNF stay has one level of care 
characterization and another part has another level of care

[[Page 197]]

characterization, Medicare will recognize only the initial level of care 
characterization for a particular part of a prior SNF stay (or if 
appealed under 42 CFR part 405, subpart G of this chapter, the level of 
care determined under appeal).
    (e) Relation of benefit period to benefit limitations. The 
limitations specified in Secs. 409.61 and 409.64, and the deductible and 
coinsurance requirements set forth in subpart G of this part apply for 
each benefit period. The limitations of Sec. 409.63 apply only to the 
initial benefit period.

<R05>
Sec. 409.61  General limitations on amount of benefits.

    (a) Inpatient hospital or inpatient CAH services. (1) Regular 
benefit days. Up to 90 days are available in each benefit period, 
subject to the limitations on days for psychiatric hospital services set 
forth in Secs. 409.62 and 409.63.
    (i) For the first 60 days (referred to in this subpart as full 
benefit days), Medicare pays the hospital or CAH for all covered 
services furnished the beneficiary, except for a deductible which is the 
beneficiary's responsibility. (Section 409.82 specifies the requirements 
for the inpatient hospital deductible.)
    (ii) For the next 30 days (referred to in this subpart as 
coinsurance days), Medicare pays for all covered services except for a 
daily coinsurance amount, which is the beneficiary's responsibility. 
(Section 409.83 specifies the inpatient hospital coinsurance amounts.)
    (2) Lifetime reserve days. Each beneficiary has a non-renewable 
lifetime reserve of 60 days of inpatient hospital or inpatient CAH 
services that he may draw upon whenever he is hospitalized for more than 
90 days in a benefit period. Upon exhaustion of the regular benefit 
days, the reserve days will be used unless the beneficiary elects not to 
use them, as provided in Sec. 409.65. For lifetime reserve days, 
Medicare pays for all covered services except for a daily coinsurance 
amount that is the beneficiary's responsibility. (See Sec. 409.83.)
    (3) Order of payment for inpatient hospital or inpatient CAH 
services. Medicare pays for inpatient hospital services in the following 
order.
    (i) The 60 full benefit days;
    (ii) The 30 coinsurance days;
    (iii) The remaining lifetime reserve days.
    (b) Posthospital SNF care furnished by a SNF, or by a hospital or a 
CAH with a swing-bed approval. Up to 100 days are available in each 
benefit period after discharge from a hospital or CAH. For the first 20 
days, Medicare pays for all covered services. For the 21st through 100th 
day, Medicare pays for all covered services except for a daily 
coinsurance amount that is the beneficiary's responsibility.
    (c) Renewal of inpatient benefits. The beneficiary's full 
entitlement to the 90 inpatient hospital or inpatient CAH regular 
benefit days, and the 100 SNF benefit days, is renewed each time he or 
she begins a benefit period. However, once lifetime reserve days are 
used, they can never be renewed.
    (d) Home health services. Medicare Part A pays for all covered home 
health services<SUP>1</SUP> with no deductible, and subject to the 
following limitations on payment for durable medical equipment (DME):
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Before July 1, 1981, Medicare Part A paid for not more than 100 
home health visits during one year following the beneficiary's most 
recent discharge from a hospital or a SNF.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) For DME furnished by an HHA that is a nominal charge provider, 
Medicare Part A pays 80 percent of fair compensation.
    (2) For DME furnished by an HHA that is not a nominal charge 
provider, Medicare Part A pays the lesser of the following:
    (i) 80 percent of the reasonable cost of the service.
    (ii) The reasonable cost of, or the customary charge for, the 
service, whichever is less, minus 20 percent of the customary (insofar 
as reasonable) charge for the service.

Sec. 409.62  Lifetime maximum on inpatient psychiatric care.

    There is a lifetime maximum of 190 days on inpatient psychiatric 
hospital

[[Page 198]]

services available to any beneficiary. Therefore, once an individual 
receives benefits for 190 days of care in a psychiatric hospital, no 
further benefits of that type are available to that individual.


<R05>
Sec. 409.63  Reduction of inpatient psychiatric benefit days available in the initial benefit period.

    (a) Reduction rule. (1) If the individual was an inpatient in a 
psychiatric hospital on the first day of Medicare entitlement and for 
any of the 150 days immediately before that first day of entitlement, 
those days are subtracted from the 150 days (90 regular days plus 60 
lifetime reserve days) which would otherwise be available in the initial 
benefit period for inpatient psychiatric services in a psychiatric or 
general hospital.
    (2) Reduction is required only if the hospital was participating in 
Medicare as a psychiatric hospital on the individual's first day of 
entitlement.
    (3) The reduction applies only to the beneficiary's first benefit 
period. For subsequent benefit periods, the 90 benefit days, plus any 
remaining lifetime reserve days, subject to the 190 day lifetime limit 
on psychiatric hospital care, are available.
    (b) Application to general hospital days. (1) Days spent in a 
general hospital before entitlement are not subtracted under paragraph 
(a) of this section even if the stay was for diagnosis or treatment of 
mental illness.
    (2) After entitlement, all psychiatric care days, whether in a 
general or a psychiatric hospital, are counted toward the number of days 
available in the initial benefit period.
    (c) Examples: (1) The individual was an inpatient of a participating 
psychiatric hospital for 20 days before the first day of entitlement and 
remained there for another 6 months. Therefore, 130 days of benefits 
(150 minus 20) are payable. Payment could be made for: 60 full benefit 
days, 30 coinsurance days, and 40 lifetime reserve days.
    (2) During the 150-day period preceding Medicare entitlement, an 
individual had been a patient of a general hospital for 60 days of 
inpatient psychiatric care and had spent 90 days in a psychiatric 
hospital, ending with the first day of entitlement. During the initial 
benefit period, the beneficiary spent 90 days in a general hospital and 
received psychiatric care there. The 60 days spent in the general 
hospital for psychiatric treatment before entitlement do not reduce the 
benefits available in the first benefit period. Only the 90 days spent 
in the psychiatric hospital before entitlement reduce such benefits, 
leaving a total of 60 available psychiatric days. However, after 
entitlement, the reduction applies not only to days spent in a 
psychiatric hospital, but also to days of psychiatric treatment in a 
general hospital. Thus, Medicare payment could be made only for 60 of 
the 90 days spent in the general hospital.
    (3) An individual was admitted to a general hospital for a mental 
condition and, after 10 days, transferred to a participating psychiatric 
hospital. The individual remained in the psychiatric hospital for 78 
days before becoming entitled to hospital insurance benefits and for 130 
days after entitlement. The beneficiary was then transferred to a 
general hospital and received treatment of a medical condition for 20 
days. The 10 days spent in the general hospital during the 150-day pre-
entitlement period have no effect on the inpatient hospital benefit days 
available to the individual for psychiatric care in the first benefit 
period, even though the general hospital stay was for a mental 
condition. Only the 78 days spent in the psychiatric hospital during the 
pre-entitlement period are subtracted from the 150 benefit days. 
Accordingly, the individual has 72 days of psychiatric care (150 days 
less 78 days) available in the first benefit period. Benefits could be 
paid for the individual's hospitalization during the first benefit 
period in the following manner. For the 130-day psychiatric hospital 
stay, 72 days (60 full benefit days and 12 coinsurance days), and for 
the general hospital stay, 20 days (18 coinsurance and 2 lifetime 
reserve days).

Sec. 409.64  Services that are counted toward allowable amounts.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section for lifetime 
reserve days, all covered inpatient days and home health visits are 
counted toward

[[Page 199]]

the allowable amounts specified in Secs. 409.61 through 409.63 if--
    (1) They are paid for by Medicare; or
    (2) They would be paid for by Medicare if the following requirements 
had been met:
    (i) A proper and timely request for payment had been filed; and
    (ii) The hospital, CAH, SNF, or home health agency had submitted all 
necessary evidence, including physician certification of need for 
services when such certification was required; or
    (3) They could not be paid for because the total payment due was 
equal to, or less than, the applicable deductible and coinsurance 
amounts.
    (b) Exception. Even though the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section are met, lifetime reserve days are not counted toward the 
allowable amounts if the beneficiary elected or is deemed to have 
elected not to use them as set forth in Sec. 409.65.

<R05>
Sec. 409.65  Lifetime reserve days.

    (a) Election not to use lifetime reserve days. (1) Whenever a 
beneficiary has exhausted the 90 regular benefit days, the hospital or 
CAH may bill Medicare for lifetime reserve days unless the beneficiary 
elects not to use them or, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section, is deemed to have elected not to use them.
    (2) It may be advantageous to elect not to use lifetime reserve days 
if the beneficiary has private insurance coverage that begins after the 
first 90 inpatient days in a benefit period, or if the daily charge is 
only slightly higher than the lifetime reserve days coinsurance amount. 
In such cases, the beneficiary may want to save the lifetime reserve 
days for future care that may be more expensive.
    (3) If the beneficiary elects not to use lifetime reserve days for a 
particular hospital or CAH stay, they are still available for a later 
stay. However, once the beneficiary uses lifetime reserve days, they can 
never be renewed.
    (4) If the beneficiary elects not to use lifetime reserve days, the 
hospital or CAH may require him or her to pay for any services furnished 
after the regular days are exhausted.
    (b) Deemed election. A beneficiary will be deemed to have elected 
not to use lifetime reserve days if the average daily charges for such 
days is equal to or less than the applicable coinsurance amount 
specified in Sec. 409.83. A beneficiary would get no benefit from using 
the days under those circumstances.
    (c) Who may file an election. An election not to use reserve days 
may be filed by--
    (1) The beneficiary; or
    (2) If the beneficiary is physically or mentally unable to act, by 
the beneficiary's legal representative. In addition, if some other 
payment source is available, such as private insurance, any person 
authorized under Sec. 405.1664 of this chapter to execute a request for 
payment for the beneficiary may file the election.
    (d) Filing the election. (1) The beneficiary's election not to use 
lifetime reserve days must be filed in writing with the hospital or CAH.
    (2) The election may be filed at the time of admission to the 
hospital or CAH or at any time thereafter up to 90 days after the 
beneficiary's discharge.
    (3) A retroactive election (that is, one made after lifetime reserve 
days have been used because the regular days were exhausted), is not 
acceptable unless it is approved by the hospital or CAH.
    (e) Period covered by election--(1) General rule. Except as provided 
in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, an election not to use lifetime 
reserve days may apply to an entire hospital or CAH stay or to a single 
period of consecutive days in a stay, but cannot apply to selected days 
in a stay. For example, a beneficiary may restrict the election to the 
period covered by private insurance but cannot use individual lifetime 
reserve days within that period. If an election not to use reserve days 
is effective after the first day on which reserve days are available, it 
must remain in effect until the end of the stay, unless it is revoked in 
accordance with Sec. 409.66.
    (2) Exception. A beneficiary election not to use lifetime reserve 
days for an inpatient hospital or inpatient CAH stay for which payment 
may be made under the prospective payment system

[[Page 200]]

(part 412 of this chapter) is subject to the following rules:
    (i) If the beneficiary has one or more regular benefit days (see 
Sec. 409.61(a)(1) of this chapter) remaining in the benefit period upon 
entering the hospital or CAH, an election not to use lifetime reserve 
days will apply automatically to all days that are not outlier days. The 
beneficiary may also elect not to use lifetime reserve days for outlier 
days but this election must apply to all outlier days.
    (ii) If the beneficiary has no regular benefit days (see 
Sec. 409.61(a)(1) of this chapter) remaining in the benefit period upon 
entering the hospital or CAH, an election not to use lifetime reserve 
days must apply to the entire hospital or CAH stay.

<R05>
Sec. 409.66  Revocation of election not to use lifetime reserve days.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a 
beneficiary (or anyone authorized to execute a request for payment, if 
the beneficiary is incapacitated) may revoke an election not to use 
lifetime reserve days during hospitalization or within 90 days after 
discharge.
    (b) The revocation must be submitted to the hospital or CAH in 
writing and identify the stay or stays to which it applies.
    (c) Exceptions. A revocation of an election not to use lifetime 
reserve days may not be filed--
    (1) After the beneficiary dies; or
    (2) After the hospital or CAH has filed a claim under the 
supplementary medical insurance program (Medicare Part B), for medical 
and other health services furnished to the beneficiary on the days in 
question.

<R05>
Sec. 409.68  Guarantee of payment for inpatient hospital or inpatient CAH services furnished before notification of exhaustion of benefits.

    (a) Conditions for payment. Payment may be made for inpatient 
hospital or inpatient CAH services furnished a beneficiary after he or 
she has exhausted the available benefit days if the following conditions 
are met:
    (1) The services were furnished before HCFA or the intermediary 
notified the hospital or CAH that the beneficiary had exhausted the 
available benefit days and was not entitled to have payment made for 
those services.
    (2) At the time the hospital or CAH furnished the services, it was 
unaware that the beneficiary had exhausted the available benefit days 
and could reasonably have assumed that he or she was entitled to have 
payment made for these services.
    (3) Payment would be precluded solely because the beneficiary has no 
benefit days available for the particular hospital or CAH stay.
    (4) The hospital or CAH claims reimbursement for the services and 
refunds any payments made for those services by the beneficiary or by 
another person on his or her behalf.
    (b) Limitations on payment. (1) If all of the conditions in 
paragraph (a) of this section are met, Medicare payment may be made for 
the day of admission, and up to 6 weekdays thereafter, plus any 
intervening Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays.
    (2) Payment may not be made under this section for any day after the 
hospital or CAH is notified that the beneficiary has exhausted the 
available benefit days.
    (c) Recovery from the beneficiary. Any payment made to a hospital or 
CAH under this section is considered an overpayment to the beneficiary 
and may be recovered from him or her under the provisions set forth 
elsewhere in this chapter.

<R04>
        Subpart G--Hospital Insurance Deductibles and Coinsurance


<R05>
Sec. 409.80  Inpatient deductible and coinsurance: General provisions.

    (a) What they are. (1) The inpatient deductible and coinsurance 
amounts are portions of the cost of covered hospital or CAH or SNF 
services that Medicare does not pay.

[[Page 201]]

    (2) The hospital or CAH or SNF may charge these amounts to the 
beneficiary or someone on his or her behalf.
    (b) Changes in the inpatient deductible and coinsurance amounts. (1) 
The law requires the Secretary to adjust the inpatient hospital 
deductible each year to reflect changes in the average cost of hospital 
care. In adjusting the deductible, the Secretary must use a formula 
specified in section 1813(b)(2) of the Act. Under that formula, the 
inpatient hospital deductible is increased each year by about the same 
percentage as the increase in the average Medicare daily hospital costs. 
The result of the deductible increase is that the beneficiary continues 
to pay about the same proportion of the hospital bill.
    (2) Since the coinsurance amounts are, by statute, specific 
fractions of the deductible, they change when the deductible changes.

[48 FR 12541, Mar. 25, 1983, as amended at 58 FR 30666, May 26, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 409.82  Inpatient hospital deductible.

    (a) General provisions--(1) The inpatient hospital deductible is a 
fixed amount chargeable to the beneficiary when he or she receives 
covered services in a hospital or a CAH for the first time in a benefit 
period.
    (2) Although the beneficiary may be hospitalized several times 
during a benefit period, the deductible is charged only once during that 
period. If the beneficiary begins more than one benefit period in the 
same year, a deductible is charged for each of those periods.
    (3) For services furnished before January 1, 1982, the applicable 
deductible is the one in effect when the benefit period began.
    (4) For services furnished after December 31, 1981, the applicable 
deductible is the one in effect during the calendar year in which the 
services were furnished.
    (b) Specific deductible amounts. The specific deductible amounts for 
each calendar year are published in the Federal Register no later than 
October 1 of the preceding year.
    (c) Exception to published amounts. If the total hospital or CAH 
charge is less than the deductible amount applicable for the calendar 
year in which the services were furnished, the amount of the charge is 
the deductible for the year.

[48 FR 12541, Mar. 25, 1983, as amended at 54 FR 4026, Jan. 27, 1989; 58 
FR 30666, 30667, May 26, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 409.83  Inpatient hospital coinsurance.

    (a) General provisions.--(1) Inpatient hospital coinsurance is the 
amount chargeable to a beneficiary for each day after the first 60 days 
of inpatient hospital care or inpatient CAH care or both in a benefit 
period.
    (2) For each day from the 61st to the 90th day, the coinsurance 
amount is \1/4\ of the applicable deductible.
    (3) For each day from the 91st to the 150th day (lifetime reserve 
days), the coinsurance amount is \1/2\ of the applicable deductible.
    (4) For coinsurance days before January 1, 1982, the coinsurance 
amount is based on the deductible applicable for the calendar year in 
which the benefit period began. The coinsurance amounts do not change 
during a beneficiary's benefit period even though the coinsurance days 
may fall in a subsequent year for which a higher deductible amount has 
been determined.
    (5) For coinsurance days after December 31, 1981, the coinsurance 
amount is based on the deductible applicable for the calendar year in 
which the services were furnished. For example, if an individual starts 
a benefit period by being admitted to a hospital in 1981 and remains in 
the hospital long enough to use coinsurance days in 1982, the 
coinsurance amount charged for those days is based on the 1982 inpatient 
hospital deductible.
    (b) Specific coinsurance amounts. The specific coinsurance amounts 
for each calendar year are published in the Federal Register no later 
than October 1 of the preceding year.
    (c) Exceptions to published amounts. (1) If the actual charge to the 
patient for the 61st through the 90th day of inpatient hospital or 
inpatient CAH services is less than the coinsurance amount applicable 
for the calendar year in which the services were furnished, the actual 
charge per day is the daily coinsurance amount.

[[Page 202]]

    (2) If the actual charge to the patient for the 91st through the 
150th day (lifetime reserve days) is less than the coinsurance amount 
applicable for the calendar year in which the services were furnished, 
the beneficiary is deemed to have elected not to use the days because he 
or she would not benefit from using them.

[48 FR 12541, Mar. 25, 1983, as amended at 54 FR 4026, Jan. 27, 1989; 58 
FR 30666, 30667, May 26, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 409.85  Skilled nursing facility (SNF) care coinsurance.

    (a) General provisions. (1) SNF care coinsurance is the amount 
chargeable to a beneficiary after the first 20 days of SNF care in a 
benefit period.
    (2) For each day from the 21st through the 100th day, the 
coinsurance is \1/8\ of the applicable inpatient hospital deductible.
    (3) For coinsurance days before January 1, 1982, the coinsurance 
amount is based on the deductible applicable for the year in which the 
benefit period began. The coinsurance amounts do not change during a 
beneficiary's benefit period even though the coinsurance days may fall 
in a subsequent year for which a higher deductible amount has been 
determined.
    (4) For coinsurance days after December 31, 1981, the coinsurance 
amount is based on the deductible applicable for the calendar year in 
which the services were furnished.
    (b) Specific coinsurance amounts. The specific SNF coinsurance 
amounts for each calendar year are published in the Federal Register no 
later than October 1 of the preceding year.
    (c) Exception to published amounts. If the actual charge to the 
patient is less than the coinsurance amount applicable for the calendar 
year in which the services were furnished, the actual charge per day is 
the daily coinsurance.

[48 FR 12541, Mar. 25, 1983, as amended at 54 FR 4026, Jan. 27, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 409.87  Blood deductible.

    (a) General provisions. (1) As used in this section, packed red 
cells means the red blood cells that remain after plasma is separated 
from whole blood.
    (2) A unit of packed red cells is treated as the equivalent of a 
unit of whole blood.
    (3) Medicare does not pay for the first 3 units of whole blood or 
units of packed red cells that a beneficiary receives, during a calendar 
year, as an inpatient of a hospital or CAH or SNF, or on an outpatient 
basis under Medicare Part B.
    (4) The deductible does not apply to other blood components such as 
platelets, fibrinogen, plasma, gamma globulin, and serum albumin, or to 
the cost of processing, storing, and administering blood.
    (5) The blood deductible is in addition to the inpatient hospital 
deductible and daily coinsurance.
    (6) The Part A blood deductible is reduced to the extent that the 
Part B blood deductible has been applied. For example, if a beneficiary 
had received one unit under Medicare Part B, and later in the same 
benefit period received three units under Medicare Part A, Medicare Part 
A would pay for the third of the latter units. (As specified in 
Sec. 410.161 of this chapter, the Part B blood deductible is reduced to 
the extent a blood deductible has been applied under Medicare Part A.)
    (b) Beneficiary's responsibility for the first 3 units of whole 
blood or packed red cells. (1) Basic rule. Except as specified in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the beneficiary is responsible for the 
first 3 units of whole blood or packed red cells. He or she has the 
option of paying the hospital's or CAH's charges for the blood or packed 
red cells or arranging for it to be replaced.
    (2) Exception. The beneficiary is not responsible for the first 3 
units of whole blood or packed red cells if the provider obtained that 
blood or red cells at no charge other than a processing or service 
charge. In that case, the blood or red cells is deemed to have been 
replaced.
    (c) Provider's right to charge for the first 3 units of whole blood 
or packed red cells--(1) Basic rule. Except as specified in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section, a provider may charge a beneficiary its 
customary charge for any of the first 3 units of whole blood or packed 
red cells.

[[Page 203]]

    (2) Exception. A provider may not charge the beneficiary for the 
first 3 units of whole blood or packed red cells in any of the following 
circumstances:
    (i) The blood or packed red cells has been replaced.
    (ii) The provider (or its blood supplier) receives, from an 
individual or a blood bank, a replacement offer that meets the criteria 
specified in paragraph (d) of this section. The provider is precluded 
from charging even if it or its blood supplier rejects the replacement 
offer.
    (iii) The provider obtained the blood or packed red cells at no 
charge other than a processing or service charge and it is therefore 
deemed to have been replaced.
    (d) Criteria for replacement of blood. A blood replacement offer 
made by a beneficiary, or an individual or a blood bank on behalf of a 
beneficiary, discharges the beneficiary's obligation to pay for 
deductible blood or packed red cells if the replacement blood meets the 
applicable criteria specified in Food and Drug Administration 
regulations under 21 CFR part 640, i.e.--
    (1) The replacement blood would not endanger the health of a 
recipient; and
    (2) The prospective donor's health would not be endangered by making 
a blood donation.

    (a) Basic rule. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 
Medicare pays hospital insurance benefits only to a participating 
provider.
    (b) Exceptions. Medicare may pay hospital insurance benefits as 
follows:
    (1) For emergency services furnished by a nonparticipating hospital, 
to the hospital or to the beneficiary, under the conditions prescribed 
in subpart G of part 424 of this chapter.
    (2) For services furnished by a Canadian or Mexican hospital, to the 
hospital or to the beneficiary, under the conditions prescribed in

<R05>
Sec. 409.102  Amounts of payment.

    (a) The amounts Medicare pays for hospital insurance benefits are 
generally determined in accordance with part 412 or part 413 of this

<R05>
Sec. 410.1  Basis and scope.

    (a) Statutory basis. Section 1832 of the Social Security Act 
establishes the scope of benefits provided under the Medicare Part B 
supplementary medical insurance (SMI) program. Sections 1833, 1834, 
1835, and 1862 set forth the amounts of payment for SMI services, the 
conditions for payment, and the exclusions from coverage. Section 1861 
defines the kinds of services that may be covered. Section 1881 provides 
for Medicare coverage for end stage renal disease patients.
    (b) Scope of part. This part sets forth the benefits available under 
Medicare Part B, the conditions for payment and the limitations on 
services, the percentage of incurred expenses that Medicare Part B pays, 
and the deductible and copayment amounts for which the

[[Page 205]]

beneficiary is responsible. (Exclusions applicable to these services are 
set forth in subpart C of part 405 of this chapter. General conditions

Sec. 410.155  Outpatient mental health treatment limitation.

    (a) Definitions. As used in this section, unless the context 
indicates otherwise, ``Mental, psychoneurotic, or personality disorder'' 
means the specific psychiatric conditions described in the American 
Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual--Mental 
Disorders. ``Hospital'' means any hospital that is primarily engaged in 
providing, by or under the supervision of physicians, diagnostic and 
therapeutic services for the medical diagnosis, treatment, and care of 
injured, disabled or sick persons, or rehabilitation services for the 
rehabilitation of injured, disabled or sick persons; or psychiatric 
services for the diagnosis and treatment of mentally ill persons; and 
medical services for the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis; or a 
critical access hospital (CAH) meeting the requirements of part 485, 
subpart F of this chapter.
    (b) Services subject to limitation. The mental health treatment 
limitation applies to the following services furnished for the treatment 
of a mental, psychoneurotic, or personality disorder, when the services 
are furnished to an individual who is not an inpatient in a hospital or 
CAH:
    (1) CORF services.
    (2) Physicians' services that meet the criteria of part 405, subpart 
F of this chapter for payment on a fee schedule basis in accordance with 
part 414 of this chapter.
    (3) Physician assistant services, as defined in section 
1861(s)(2)(K)(i) of the Act, that are furnished after December 31, 1990.
    (4) Clinical psychologist services, as defined in section 1861(ii) 
of the Act, that are furnished after December 31, 1990.
    (c) Limitation on incurred expenses--(1) Current limit. For purposes 
of Secs. 410.152 and 410.160, incurred expenses for the services 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section exclude expenses that are in 
excess of 62\1/2\ percent of the sum of the reasonable charges for 
physician services and the customary charges for CORF services.
    (2) Previous limits. For years before calendar year 1990, incurred 
expenses that could be considered were limited to the lower of the 
current 62\1/2\ percent and a fixed dollar amount that--
    (i) For calendar years before 1988, was $312.50;
    (ii) For calendar year 1988, was $562.50; and
    (iii) For calendar year 1989, was $1,375.
    (d) Example.

    As a private patient, Mr. X's only medical expenses during the 
calendar year 1982 amounted to $750 for physicians' services in 
connection with the treatment of a mental disorder which did not require 
inpatient hospitalization. The statutory limit for any calendar year on 
the amount of these expenses that is covered under this subpart B is 
$312.50 ($312.50 being lesser in amount than 62\1/2\ percent of $750). 
Mr. X is required to meet the first $75 as a deductible, and 20 percent 
of the balance. The remaining 80 percent is payable under this subpart 
B.

<R05>
Sec. 410.160  Part B annual deductible.

    (a) Basic rule. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 
incurred expenses (as defined in Sec. 410.152) are subject to, and count 
toward meeting the annual deductible.
    (b) Exceptions. Expenses incurred for the following services are not 
subject to the Part B annual deductible and do not count toward meeting 
that deductible:
    (1) Home health services.
    (2) Pneumococcal vaccines and their administration.
    (3) Federally qualified health center services.
    (4) ASC facility services furnished before July 1987 and physician 
services furnished before April 1988 that met the requirements for 
payment of 100 percent of the reasonable charges.
    (c) Application of the Part B annual deductible. (1) Before payment 
is made under Sec. 410.152, an individual's incurred expenses for the 
calendar year are reduced by the Part B annual deductible.
    (2) The Part B annual deductible is applied to incurred expenses in 
the order in which claims for those expenses are processed by the 
Medicare program.
    (3) Only one Part B annual deductible may be imposed for any 
calendar year and it may be met by any combination of expenses incurred 
in that year.
    (d) Special rule for services reimbursable on a formula basis. (1) 
In applying the formula that takes into account reasonable costs, 
customary charges, and customary (insofar as reasonable) charges, and is 
used to determine payment for services furnished by a provider that is 
not a nominal charge provider, the Medicare intermediary takes the 
following steps:
    (i) Reduces the customary charges for the services by an amount 
equal to any unmet portion of the deductible for the calendar year, in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. (The amount of this 
reduction is considered to be the amount of the deductible that is met 
on the basis of the services to which it is applied.)
    (ii) Determines 20 percent of any remaining portion of the customary 
(insofar as reasonable) charge.
    (iii) Determines the lesser of the reasonable cost of the services 
and the customary charges for the services.
    (iv) Reduces the amount determined under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of 
this section by the sum of the reduction made under paragraph (c)(1)(i) 
of this section and the amount determined under parargaph (c)(1)(ii) of 
this section.
    (v) Reduces the reasonable cost of the services by the amount of the 
reduction made under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section and multiplies 
the result by 80 percent.
    (2) In accordance with Sec. 410.152(b)(1), the amount payable is the 
amount determined under paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, or the 
amount determined under paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section, whichever 
is less.
    (e) Special rule for services of an independent rural health clinic. 
Application of the Part B annual deductible to rural health clinic 
services is in accordance with Sec. 405.2425(b)(2) of this chapter.
    (f) Amount of the Part B annual deductible. (1) Beginning with 
expenses for services furnished during calendar year 1982, the Part B 
annual deductible is $75.
    (2) From 1973 through 1981, the deductible was $60.
    (3) From 1966 through 1972, the deductible was $50.
    (g) Carryover of Part B annual deductible. For calendar years before 
1982, the Part B annual deductible was reduced by the amount of expenses 
incurred during the last quarter of the preceding year that was applied 
to meet the deductible for that preceding year. Example: If $20 of 
expenses incurred in November 1980 was used to meet the 1980

[[Page 228]]

deductible, the 1981 deductible was reduced to $40 ($60-$20).
    (h) Examples of application of the annual deductible. (1) Mr. A 
submitted claims for the following expenses incurred during 1982: $20 
for services furnished in March by physician X; $30 for services 
furnished in April by physician Y; $50 for services furnished in June by 
physician Z, for a total of $100. The carrier determined that the 
charges as submitted were the reasonable charges. The first $75 of 
expenses for which claims were processed is applied to meet the $75 
deductible for that year. Medicare Part B pays 80 percent of the 
remaining $25, or $20.
    (2) Mr. B submitted a claim that included a $25 charge by a doctor 
for an examination to prescribe a hearing aid and an $80 charge for 
office surgery. This was the first claim relating to Mr. B's medical 
expenses processed in the calendar year. The carrier disallowed the $25 
charge because the type of examination is not covered by Medicare. The 
carrier reduced the $80 surgery charge to a reasonable charge of $40. 
Only the $40 reasonable charge for covered services will count toward 
meeting Mr. B's deductible. Since the remainder of the surgery charge 
constitutes and excess over the reasonable charge, it cannot be applied 
to satisfy Mr. B's deductible.
    (3) Mr. C became entitled to Medicare Part B benefits on July 1, 
1982. He incurred expenses of $200 in July, August, and September. The 
carrier determined that the changes as submitted were reasonable. Even 
though Mr. C was entitled to benefits for only half the year, he must 
meet the full $75 deductible. Thus, $75 of this expense constitutes Mr. 
C's deductible. Medicare would pay $100, which is 80 percent of the 
remaining $125.

    (a) General rules. (1) As used in this section, packed red cells 
means the red blood cells that remain after plasma is separated from 
whole blood.
    (2) A unit of packed red cells is treated as the equivalent of a 
pint of whole blood, which in this section is referred to as a unit of 
whole blood.
    (3) Medicare does not pay for the first 3 units of whole blood or 
units of packed red cells that are furnished under Part A or Part B in a 
calendar year. The Part B blood deductible is reduced to the extent that 
a blood deductible has been applied under Part A.
    (4) The blood deductible does not apply to other blood components 
such as platelets, fibrinogen, plasma, gamma globulin and serum albumin, 
or to the costs of processing, storing, and administering blood.
    (5) The blood deductible is in addition to the Part B annual 
deductible specified in Sec. 410.160.
    (b) Beneficiary's responsibility for the first 3 units of blood. (1) 
The beneficiary is responsible for the first three units of whole blood 
or packed red cells received during a calendar year.
    (2) If the blood is furnished by a hospital or CAH, the rules set 
forth in Sec. 409.87 (b), (c), and (d) of this chapter apply.
    (3) If the blood is furnished by a physician, clinic, or other 
supplier that has accepted assignment of Medicare benefits, or claims 
payment under Sec. 424.64 of this chapter because the beneficiary died 
without assigning benefits, the supplier may charge the beneficiary the 
reasonable charge for the first 3 units, to the extent that those units 
are not replaced.

   Subpart A--General Exclusions and Exclusion of Particular Services


<R05>
Sec. 411.1  Basis and scope.

    (a) Statutory basis. Sections 1814(c), 1835(d), and 1862 of the Act 
exclude from Medicare payment certain specified services. The Act 
provides special rules for payment of services furnished by Federal 
providers or agencies (sections 1814(c) and 1835(d)), by hospitals and 
physicians outside the United States (sections 1814(f) and 1862(a)(4)), 
and by hospitals and SNFs of the Indian Health Service (section 1880). 
Section 1877 sets forth limitations on referrals and payment for 
clinical laboratory services furnished by entities with which the 
referring physician (or an immediate family member of the referring 
physician) has a financial relationship. Sections 1842(l) and 1879 of 
the Act provide for refund to, or indemnification of, a beneficiary who 
has paid a provider or supplier for certain services that the provider 
or supplier knew were excluded from Medicare coverage.
    (b) Scope. This subpart identifies:
    (1) The particular types of services that are excluded;
    (2) The circumstances under which Medicare denies payment for 
certain services that are usually covered; and
    (3) The circumstances under which Medicare pays for services usually 
excluded from payment.

the context indicates otherwise--
    Conditional payment means a Medicare payment for services for which 
another payer is responsible, made either on the bases set forth in 
subparts C through H of this part, or because the intermediary or

party payments, means services for which a third party payer would pay 
if a proper claim were filed.

<R05>
Sec. 411.24  Recovery of conditional payments.

    If a Medicare conditional payment is made, the following rules 
apply:
    (a) Release of information. The filing of a Medicare claim by on or 
behalf of the beneficiary constitutes an express authorization for any 
entity, including State Medicaid and workers' compensation agencies, and 
data depositories, that possesses information pertinent to the Medicare 
claim to release that information to HCFA. This information will be used 
only for Medicare claims processing and for coordination of benefits 
purposes.
    (b) Right to initiate recovery. HCFA may initiate recovery as soon 
as it learns that payment has been made or could be made under workers' 
compensation, any liability or no-fault insurance, or an employer group 
health plan.
    (c) Amount of recovery. (1) If it is not necessary for HCFA to take 
legal action to recover, HCFA recovers the lesser of the following:
    (i) The amount of the Medicare primary payment.
    (ii) The full primary payment amount that the primary payer is 
obligated to pay under this part without regard to any payment, other 
than a full primary payment that the primary payer has paid or will 
make, or, in the case of a third party payment recipient, the amount of 
the third party payment.
    (2) If it is necessary for HCFA to take legal action to recover from 
the primary payer, HCFA may recover twice the amount specified in 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
    (d) Methods of recovery. HCFA may recover by direct collection or by 
offset against any monies HCFA owes the entity responsible for refunding 
the conditional payment.
    (e) Recovery from third parties. HCFA has a direct right of action 
to recover from any entity responsible for making primary payment. This 
includes an employer, an insurance carrier, plan, or program, and a 
third party administrator.
    (f) Claims filing requirements. (1) HCFA may recover without regard 
to any claims filing requirements that the insurance program or plan 
imposes on the beneficiary or other claimant such as a time limit for 
filing a claim or a time limit for notifying the plan or program about 
the need for or receipt of services.
    (2) However, HCFA will not recover its payment for particular 
services in the face of a claims filing requirement unless it has filed 
a claim for recovery by the end of the year following the year in which 
the Medicare intermediary or carrier that paid the claim has notice that 
the third party is primary to Medicare for those particular services. (A 
notice received during the last three months of a year is considered 
received during the following year.)
    (g) Recovery from parties that receive third party payments. HCFA 
has a right of action to recover its payments from any entity, including 
a beneficiary, provider, supplier, physician, attorney, State agency or 
private insurer that has received a third party payment.
    (h) Reimbursement to Medicare. If the beneficiary or other party 
receives a third party payment, the beneficiary or other party must 
reimburse Medicare within 60 days.
    (i) Special rules. (1) In the case of liability insurance 
settlements and disputed claims under employer group health plans and 
no-fault insurance, the following rule applies: If Medicare

[[Page 238]]

is not reimbursed as required by paragraph (h) of this section, the 
third party payer must reimburse Medicare even though it has already 
reimbursed the beneficiary or other party.
    (2) The provisions of paragraph (i)(1) of this section also apply if 
a third party payer makes its payment to an entity other than Medicare 
when it is, or should be, aware that Medicare has made a conditional 
primary payment.
    (3) In situations that involve procurement costs, the rule of 
Sec. 411.37(b) applies.
    (j) Recovery against Medicaid agency. If a third party payment is 
made to a State Medicaid agency and that agency does not reimburse 
Medicare, HCFA may reduce any Federal funds due the Medicaid agency 
(under title XIX of the Act) by an amount equal to the Medicare payment 
or the third party payment, whichever is less.
    (k) Recovery against Medicare contractor. If a Medicare contractor, 
including an intermediary or carrier, also insures, underwrites, or 
administers as a third party administrator, a program or plan that is 
primary to Medicare, and does not reimburse Medicare, HCFA may offset 
the amount owed against any funds due the intermediary or carrier under 
title XVIII of the Act or due the contractor under the contract.
    (l) Recovery when there is failure to file a proper claim. (1) Basic 
rule. If Medicare makes a conditional payment with respect to services 
for which the beneficiary or provider or supplier has not filed a proper 
claim with a third party payer, and Medicare is unable to recover from 
the third party payer, Medicare may recover from the beneficiary or 
provider or supplier that was responsible for the failure to file a 
proper claim.
    (2) Exceptions: (i) This rule does not apply in the case of 
liability insurance nor when failure to file a proper claim is due to 
mental or physical incapacity of the beneficiary.
    (ii) HCFA will not recover from providers or suppliers that are in 
compliance with the requirements of Sec. 489.20 of this chapter and can 
show that the reason they failed to file a proper claim is that the 
beneficiary, or someone acting on his or her behalf, failed to give, or 
gave erroneous, information regarding coverage that is primary to 
Medicare.
    (m) Interest charges. (1) With respect to recovery of payments for 
items and services furnished before October 31, 1994, HCFA charges 
interest, exercising common law authority in accordance with 45 CFR 
30.13, consistent with the Federal Claims Collection Act (31 U.S.C. 
3711).
    (2) In addition to its common law authority with respect to recovery 
of payments for items and services furnished on or after October 31, 
1994, HCFA charges interest in accordance with section 1862(b)(2)(B)(i) 
of the Act. Under that provision--
    (i) HCFA may charge interest if reimbursement is not made to the 
appropriate trust fund before the expiration of the 60-day period that 
begins on the date on which notice or other information is received by 
HCFA that payment has been or could be made under a primary plan;
    (ii) Interest may accrue from the date when that notice or other 
information is received by HCFA and is charged until reimbursement is 
made; and
    (iii) The rate of interest is that provided at 42 CFR 405.376(d).

<R05>
Sec. 411.25  Third party payer's notice of mistaken Medicare primary payment.

    (a) If a third party payer learns that HCFA has made a Medicare 
primary payment for services for which the third party payer has made or 
should have made primary payment, it must give notice to that effect to 
the Medicare intermediary or carrier that paid the claim.
    (b) The notice must describe the specific situation and the 
circumstances (including the particular type of insurance coverage as 
specified in Sec. 411.20(a)) and, if appropriate, the time period during 
which the insurer is primary to Medicare.
    (c) If a plan is self-insured and self-administered, the employer 
must give

[[Page 239]]

the notice to HCFA. Otherwise, the insurer, underwriter, or third party 
administrator must give the notice.

[54 FR 41734, Oct. 11, 1989; as amended at 55 FR 1820, Jan. 19, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 411.26  Subrogation and right to intervene.

    (a) Subrogation. With respect to services for which Medicare paid, 
HCFA is subrogated to any individual, provider, supplier, physician, 
private insurer, State agency, attorney, or any other entity entitled to 
payment by a third party payer.
    (b) Right to intervene. HCFA may join or intervene in any action 
related to the events that gave rise to the need for services for which 
Medicare paid.


<R05>
Sec. 411.28  Waiver of recovery and compromise of claims.

    (a) HCFA may waive recovery, in whole or in part, if the probability 
of recovery, or the amount involved, does not warrant pursuit of the 
claim.
    (b) General rules applicable to compromise of claims are set forth 
in subpart F of part 401 and Sec. 405.376 of this chapter.
    (c) Other rules pertinent to recovery are contained in subpart C of 
part 405 of this chapter.

[54 FR 41734, Oct. 11, 1989, as amended at 61 FR 63749, Dec. 2, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 411.30  Effect of third party payment on benefit utilization and deductibles.

    (a) Benefit utilization. Inpatient psychiatric hospital and SNF care 
that is paid for by a third party payer is not counted against the 
number of inpatient care days available to the beneficiary under 
Medicare Part A.
    (b) Deductibles. Expenses for Medicare covered services that are 
paid for by third party payers are credited toward the Medicare Part A 
and Part B deductibles.


<R05>
Sec. 411.31  Authority to bill third party payers for full charges.

    (a) The fact that Medicare payments are limited to the DRG amount, 
or the reasonable charge, reasonable cost, capitation or fee schedule 
rate, does not affect the amount that a third party payer may pay.
    (b) With respect to workers' compensation plans, no-fault insurers, 
and employer group health plans, a provider or supplier may bill its 
full charges and expect those charges to be paid unless there are limits 
imposed by laws other than title XVIII of the Act or by agreements with 
the third party payer.


<R05>
Sec. 411.32  Basis for Medicare secondary payments.

    (a) Basic rules. (1) Medicare benefits are secondary to benefits 
payable by a third party payer even if State law or the third party 
payer states that its benefits are secondary to Medicare benefits or 
otherwise limits its payments to Medicare beneficiaries.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, Medicare 
makes secondary payments, within the limits specified in paragraph (c) 
of this section and in Sec. 411.33, to supplement the third party 
payment if that payment is less than the charges for the services and, 
in the case of services paid on other than a reasonable charge basis, 
less than the gross amount payable by Medicare under Sec. 411.33(e).
    (b) Exception. Medicare does not make a secondary payment if the 
provider or supplier is either obligated to accept, or voluntarily 
accepts, as full payment, a third party payment that is less than its 
charges.
    (c) General limitation: Failure to file a proper claim. When a 
provider or supplier, or a beneficiary who is not physically or mentally 
incapacitated, receives a reduced third party payment because of failure 
to file a proper claim, the Medicare secondary payment may not exceed 
the amount that would have been payable under Sec. 411.33 if the third 
party payer had paid on the basis of a proper claim.

The provider, supplier, or beneficiary must inform HCFA that a reduced 
payment was made, and the amount that would have been paid if a proper 
claim had been filed.


<R05>
Sec. 411.33  Amount of Medicare secondary payment.

    (a) Services for which HCFA pays on a Medicare fee schedule or 
reasonable charge basis. The Medicare secondary payment is the lowest of 
the following:

[[Page 240]]

    (1) The actual charge by the supplier (or the amount the supplier is 
obligated to accept as payment in full if that is less than the charges) 
minus the amount paid by the third party payer.
    (2) The amount that Medicare would pay if the services were not 
covered by a third party payer.
    (3) The higher of the Medicare fee schedule, Medicare reasonable 
charge, or other amount which would be payable under Medicare (without 
regard to any applicable Medicare deductible or coinsurance amounts) or 
the third party payer's allowable charge (without regard to any 
deductible or co-insurance imposed by the policy or plan) minus the 
amount actually paid by the third party payer.
    (b) Example: An individual received treatment from a physician for 
which the physician charged $175. The third party payer allowed $150 of 
the charge and paid 80 percent of this amount or $120. The Medicare fee 
schedule for this treatment is $125. The individual's Part B deductible 
had been met. As secondary payer, Medicare pays the lowest of the 
following amounts:
    (1) Excess of actual charge minus the third party payment: 
$175-120=$55.
    (2) Amount Medicare would pay if the services were not covered by a 
third party payer: .80 x $125=$100.
    (3) Third party payer's allowable charge without regard to its 
coinsurance (since that amount is higher than the Medicare fee schedule 
in this case) minus amount paid by the third party payer: $150-120=$30.

The Medicare payment is $30.
    (c)-(d)  [Reserved]
    (e) Services reimbursed on a basis other than fee schedule, 
reasonable charge, or monthly capitation rate. The Medicare secondary 
payment is the lowest of the following:
    (1) The gross amount payable by Medicare (that is, the amount 
payable without considering the effect of the Medicare deductible and 
coinsurance or the payment by the third party payer), minus the 
applicable Medicare deductible and coinsurance amounts.
    (2) The gross amount payable by Medicare, minus the amount paid by 
the third party payer.
    (3) The provider's charges (or the amount the provider is obligated 
to accept as payment in full, if that is less than the charges), minus 
the amount payable by the third party payer.
    (4) The provider's charges (or the amount the provider is obligated 
to accept as payment in full if that is less than the charges), minus 
the applicable Medicare deductible and coinsurance amounts.
    (f) Examples: (1) A hospital furnished 7 days of inpatient hospital 
care in 1987 to a Medicare beneficiary. The provider's charges for 
Medicare-covered services totaled $2,800. The third party payer paid 
$2,360. No part of the Medicare inpatient hospital deductible of $520 
had been met. If the gross amount payable by Medicare in this case is 
$2,700, then as secondary payer, Medicare pays the lowest of the 
following amounts:
    (i) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the Medicare 
inpatient hospital deductible: $2,700-$520=$2,180.
    (ii) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the third party 
payment: $2,700-$2,360=$340.
    (iii) The provider's charges minus the third party payment: 
$2,800-$2,360=$440.
    (iv) The provider's charges minus the Medicare deductible: 
$2,800-$520=$2,280. Medicare's secondary payment is $340 and the 
combined payment made by the third party payer and Medicare on behalf of 
the beneficiary is $2,700. The $520 deductible was satisfied by the 
third party payment so that the beneficiary incurred no out-of-pocket 
expenses.
    (2) A hospital furnished 1 day of inpatient hospital care in 1987 to 
a Medicare beneficiary. The provider's charges for Medicare-covered 
services totalled $750. The third party payer paid $450. No part of the 
Medicare inpatient hospital deductible had been met previously. The 
third party payment is credited toward that deductible. If the gross 
amount payable by Medicare in this case is $850, then as secondary 
payer, Medicare pays the lowest of the following amounts:
    (i) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the Medicare 
deductible: $850-$520=$330.

[[Page 241]]

    (ii) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the third party 
payment: $850-$450=$400.
    (iii) The provider's charges minus the third party payment: 
$750-$450=$300.
    (iv) The provider's charges minus the Medicare deductible: 
$750-$520=$230. Medicare's secondary payment is $230, and the combined 
payment made by the third party payer and Medicare on behalf of the 
beneficiary is $680. The hospital may bill the beneficiary $70 (the $520 
deductible minus the $450 third party payment). This fully discharges 
the beneficiary's deductible obligation.
    (3) An ESRD beneficiary received 8 dialysis treatments for which a 
facility charged $160 per treatment for a total of $1,280. No part of 
the beneficiary's $75 Part B deductible had been met. The third party 
payer paid $1,024 for Medicare-covered services. The composite rate per 
dialysis treatment at this facility is $131 or $1,048 for 8 treatments. 
As secondary payer, Medicare pays the lowest of the following:
    (i) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the applicable 
Medicare deductible and coinsurance: $1,048-$75-$194.60=$778.40. (The 
coinsurance is calculated as follows: $1,048 composite rate-$75 
deductible=$973 x .20=$194.60).
    (ii) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the third party 
payment: $1,048-$1,024=$24.
    (iii) The provider's charges minus the third party payment: 
$1,280-$1,024=$256.
    (iv) The provider's charge minus the Medicare deductible and 
coinsurance: $1,280-$75-$194.60=1010.40. Medicare pays $24. The 
beneficiary's Medicare deductible and coinsurance were met by the third 
party payment.
    (4) A hospital furnished 5 days of inpatient care in 1987 to a 
Medicare beneficiary. The provider's charges for Medicare-covered 
services were $4,000 and the gross amount payable was $3,500. The 
provider agreed to accept $3,000 from the third party as payment in 
full. The third party payer paid $2,900 due to a deductible requirement 
under the third party plan. Medicare considers the amount the provider 
is obligated to accept as full payment ($3,000) to be the provider 
charges. The Medicare secondary payment is the lowest of the following:
    (i) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the Medicare 
inpatient deductible: $3,500-$520=$2,980.
    (ii) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the third party 
payment: $3,500-$2,900=$600.
    (iii) The provider's charge minus the third party payment: 
$3,000-$2,900=$100.
    (iv) The provider's charges minus the Medicare inpatient deductible: 
$3,000-$520=$2,480. The Medicare secondary payment is $100. When 
Medicare is the secondary payer, the combined payment made by the third 
party payer and Medicare on behalf of the beneficiary is $3,000. The 
beneficiary has no liability for Medicare-covered services since the 
third party payment satisfied the $520 deductible.

<R05>
Sec. 411.35  Limitations on charges to a beneficiary or other party when a workers' compensation plan, a no-fault insurer, or an employer group health plan is 
          primary payer.

    (a) Definition. As used in this section Medicare-covered services 
means services for which Medicare benefits are payable or would be 
payable except for the Medicare deductible and coinsurance provisions 
and the amounts payable by the third party payer.
    (b) Applicability. This section applies when a workers' compensation 
plan, a no-fault insurer or an employer group health plan is primary to 
Medicare.
    (c) Basic rule. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, 
the amounts the provider or supplier may collect or seek to collect, for 
the Medicare-covered services from the beneficiary or any entity other 
than the workers' compensation plan, the no-fault insurer, or the 
employer plan and Medicare, are limited to the following:
    (1) The amount paid or payable by the third party payer to the 
beneficiary. If this amount exceeds the amount payable by Medicare 
(without regard to deductible or coinsurance), the provider or supplier 
may retain the third party payment in full without violating the terms 
of the provider

[[Page 242]]

agreement or the conditions of assignment.
    (2) The amount, if any, by which the applicable Medicare deductible 
and coinsurance amounts exceed any third party payment made or due to 
the beneficiary or to the provider or supplier for the medical services.
    (3) The amount of any charges that may be made to a beneficiary 
under Sec. 413.35 of this chapter when cost limits are applied to the 
services, or under Sec. 489.32 of this chapter when the services are 
partially covered, but only to the extent that the third party payer is 
not responsible for those charges.
    (d) Exception. The limitations of paragraph (c) of this section do 
not apply if the services were furnished by a supplier that is not a 
participating supplier and has not accepted assignment for the services 
or claimed payment under Sec. 424.64 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 411.37  Amount of Medicare recovery when a third party payment is made as a result of a judgment or settlement.

    (a) Recovery against the party that received payment--(1) General 
rule. Medicare reduces its recovery to take account of the cost of 
procuring the judgment or settlement, as provided in this section, if--
    (i) Procurement costs are incurred because the claim is disputed; 
and
    (ii) Those costs are borne by the party against which HCFA seeks to 
recover.
    (2) Special rule. If HCFA must file suit because the party that 
received payment opposes HCFA's recovery, the recovery amount is as set 
forth in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (b) Recovery against the third party payer. If HCFA seeks recovery 
from the third party payer, in accordance with Sec. 411.24(i), the 
recovery amount will be no greater than the amount determined under 
paragraph (c) or (d) or (e) of this section.
    (c) Medicare payments are less than the judgment or settlement 
amount. If Medicare payments are less than the judgment or settlement 
amount, the recovery is computed as follows:
    (1) Determine the ratio of the procurement costs to the total 
judgment or settlement payment.
    (2) Apply the ratio to the Medicare payment. The product is the 
Medicare share of procurement costs.
    (3) Subtract the Medicare share of procurement costs from the 
Medicare payments. The remainder is the Medicare recovery amount.
    (d) Medicare payments equal or exceed the judgment or settlement 
amount. If Medicare payments equal or exceed the judgment or settlement 
amount, the recovery amount is the total judgment or settlement payment 
minus the total procurement costs.
    (e) HCFA incurs procurement costs because of opposition to its 
recovery. If HCFA must bring suit against the party that received 
payment because that party opposes HCFA's recovery, the recovery amount 
is the lower of the following:
    (1) Medicare payment.
    (2) The total judgment or settlement amount, minus the party's total 
procurement cost.


<R04>
 Subpart C--Limitations on Medicare Payment for Services Covered under 
                          Workers' Compensation


<R05>
Sec. 411.40  General provisions.

    (a) Definition. ``Workers' compensation plan of the United States'' 
includes the workers' compensation plans of the 50 States, the District 
of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, 
as well as the systems provided under the Federal Employees' 
Compensation Act and the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation 
Act.
    (b) Limitations on Medicare payment. (1) Medicare does not pay for 
any services for which--
    (i) Payment has been made, or can reasonably be expected to be made 
promptly under a workers' compensation law or plan of the United States 
or a state; or
    (ii) Payment could be made under the Federal Black Lung Program, but 
is precluded solely because the provider of the services has failed to 
secure, from the Department of Labor, a provider number to include in 
the claim.
    (2) If the payment for a service may not be made under workers' 
compensation because the service is furnished by

[[Page 243]]

a source not authorized to provide that service under the particular 
workers' compensation program, Medicare pays for the service if it is a 
covered service.
    (3) Medicare makes secondary payments in accordance with Sec. 411.32 
and Sec. 411.33.


<R05>
Sec. 411.43  Beneficiary's responsibility with respect to workers' compensation.

    (a) The beneficiary is responsible for taking whatever action is 
necessary to obtain any payment that can reasonably be expected under 
workers' compensation.
    (b) Except as specified in Sec. 411.45(a), Medicare does not pay 
until the beneficiary has exhausted his or her remedies under workers' 
compensation.
    (c) Except as specified in Sec. 411.45(b), Medicare does not pay for 
services that would have been covered under workers' compensation if the 
beneficiary had filed a proper claim.
    (d) However, if a claim is denied for reasons other than not being a 
proper claim, Medicare pays for the services if they are covered under 
Medicare.


<R05>
Sec. 411.45  Basis for conditional Medicare payment in workers' compensation cases.

    A conditional Medicare payment may be made under either of the 
following circumstances:
    (a) The beneficiary has filed a proper claim for workers' 
compensation benefits, but the intermediary or carrier determines that 
the workers' compensation carrier will not pay promptly. This includes 
cases in which a workers' compensation carrier has denied a claim.
    (b) The beneficiary, because of physical or mental incapacity, 
failed to file a proper claim.


<R05>
Sec. 411.46  Lump-sum payments.

    (a) Lump-sum commutation of future benefits. If a lump-sum 
compensation award stipulates that the amount paid is intended to 
compensate the individual for all future medical expenses required 
because of the work-related injury or disease, Medicare payments for 
such services are excluded until medical expenses related to the injury 
or disease equal the amount of the lump-sum payment.
    (b) Lump-sum compromise settlement. (1) A lump-sum compromise 
settlement is deemed to be a workers' compensation payment for Medicare 
purposes, even if the settlement agreement stipulates that there is no 
liability under the workers' compensation law or plan.
    (2) If a settlement appears to represent an attempt to shift to 
Medicare the responsibility for payment of medical expenses for the 
treatment of a work-related condition, the settlement will not be 
recognized. For example, if the parties to a settlement attempt to 
maximize the amount of disability benefits paid under workers' 
compensation by releasing the workers' compensation carrier from 
liability for medical expenses for a particular condition even though 
the facts show that the condition is work-related, Medicare will not pay 
for treatment of that condition.
    (c) Lump-sum compromise settlement: Effect on services furnished 
before the date of settlement. Medicare pays for medical expenses 
incurred before the lump-sum compromise settlement only to the extent 
specified in Sec. 411.47.
    (d) Lump-sum compromise settlement: Effect on payment for services 
furnished after the date of settlement--(1) Basic rule. Except as 
specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, if a lump-sum compromise 
settlement forecloses the possibility of future payment of workers' 
compensation benefits, medical expenses incurred after the date of the 
settlement are payable under Medicare.
    (2) Exception. If the settlement agreement allocates certain amounts 
for specific future medical services, Medicare does not pay for those 
services until medical expenses related to the injury or disease equal 
the amount of the lump-sum settlement allocated to future medical 
expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 411.47  Apportionment of a lump-sum compromise settlement of a workers' compensation claim.

    (a) Determining amount of compromise settlement considered as a 
payment for medical expenses. (1) If a compromise settlement allocates a 
portion of the payment for medical expenses and also

[[Page 244]]

gives reasonable recognition to the income replacement element, that 
apportionment may be accepted as a basis for determining Medicare 
payments.
    (2) If the settlement does not give reasonable recognition to both 
elements of a workers' compensation award or does not apportion the sum 
granted, the portion to be considered as payment for medical expenses is 
computed as follows:
    (i) Determine the ratio of the amount awarded (less the reasonable 
and necessary costs incurred in procuring the settlement) to the total 
amount that would have been payable under workers' compensation if the 
claim had not been compromised.
    (ii) Multiply that ratio by the total medical expenses incurred as a 
result of the injury or disease up to the date of the settlement. The 
product is the amount of the workers' compensation settlement to be 
considered as payment for medical expenses.

    Example: As the result of a work injury, an individual suffered loss 
of income and incurred medical expenses for which the total workers' 
compensation payment would have been $24,000 if the case had not been 
compromised. The medical expenses amounted to $18,000. The workers' 
compensation carrier made a settlement with the beneficiary under which 
it paid $8,000 in total. A separate award was made for legal fees. Since 
the workers' compensation compromise settlement was for one-third of the 
amount which would have been payable under workers' compensation had the 
case not been compromised ($8,000/$24,000=\1/3\), the workers' 
compensation compromise settlement is considered to have paid for one-
third of the total medical expenses (\1/3\ x $18,000=$6,000).

    (b) Determining the amount of the Medicare overpayment. When 
conditional Medicare payments have been made, and the beneficiary 
receives a compromise settlement payment, the Medicare overpayment is 
determined as set forth in this paragraph (b). The amount of the 
workers' compensation payment that is considered to be for medical 
expenses (as determined under paragraph (a) of this section) is applied, 
at the workers' compensation rate of payment prevailing in the 
particular jurisdiction, in the following order:
    (1) First to any beneficiary payments for services payable under 
workers' compensation but not covered under Medicare.
    (2) Then to any beneficiary payments for services payable under 
workers' compensation and also covered under Medicare Part B. (These 
include deductible and coinsurance amounts and, in unassigned cases, the 
charge in excess of the reasonable charge.)
    (3) Last to any beneficiary payments for services payable under 
workers' compensation and also covered under Medicare Part A. (These 
include Part A deductible and coinsurance amounts and charges for 
services furnished after benefits are exhausted.)

The difference between the amount of the workers' compensation payment 
for medical expenses and any beneficiary payments constitutes the 
Medicare overpayment. The beneficiary is liable for that amount.

    Example: In the example in paragraph (a) of this section, it was 
determined that the workers' compensation settlement paid for $6,000 of 
the total medical expenses. The $18,000 in medical expenses included 
$1,500 in charges for services not covered under Medicare, $7,500 in 
charges for services covered under Medicare Part B, and $9,000 in 
hospital charges for services covered under Medicare Part A. All charges 
were at the workers' compensation payment rate, that is, in amounts the 
provider or supplier must accept as payment in full.
    The Medicare reasonable charge for physicians' services was $7,000 
and Medicare paid $5,600 (80 percent of the reasonable charge). The Part 
B deductible had been met. The Medicare payment rate for the hospital 
services was $8,000. Medicare paid the hospital $7,480 ($8,000--the Part 
A deductible of $520).
    In this situation, the beneficiary's payments totalled $3,920:

                                                                        
                                                                        
                                                                        
Services not covered under Medicare............................   $1,500
Excess of physicians' charges over reasonable charges..........      500
Medicare Part B coinsurance....................................    1,400
Part A deductible..............................................      520
                                                                --------
      Total....................................................    3,920
                                                                        

    The Medicare overpayment, for which the beneficiary is liable, would 
be $2,080 ($6,000-$3,920).

 Subpart D--Limitations on Medicare Payment for Services Covered Under 
                     Liability or No-Fault Insurance


<R05>
Sec. 411.50  General provisions.

    (a) Limits on applicability. The provisions of this subpart C do not 
apply to any services required because of accidents that occurred before 
December 5, 1980.
    (b) Definitions.
    Automobile means any self-propelled land vehicle of a type that must 
be registered and licensed in the State in which it is owned.
    Liability insurance means insurance (including a self-insured plan) 
that provides payment based on legal liability for injury or illness or 
damage to property. It includes, but is not limited to, automobile 
liability insurance, uninsured motorist insurance, underinsured motorist 
insurance, homeowners' liability insurance, malpractice insurance, 
product liability insurance, and general casualty insurance.
    Liability insurance payment means a payment by a liability insurer, 
or an out-of-pocket payment, including a payment to cover a deductible 
required by a liability insurance policy, by any individual or other 
entity that carries liability insurance or is covered by a self-insured 
plan.
    No-fault insurance means insurance that pays for medical expenses 
for injuries sustained on the property or premises of the insured, or in 
the use, occupancy, or operation of an automobile, regardless of who may 
have been responsible for causing the accident. This insurance includes 
but is not limited to automobile, homeowners, and commercial plans. It 
is sometimes called ``medical payments coverage'', ``personal injury 
protection'', or ``medical expense coverage''.
    Prompt or promptly, when used in connection with payment by a 
liability insurer means payment within 120 days after the earlier of the 
following:
    (1) The date a claim is filed with an insurer or a lien is filed 
against a potential liability settlement.
    (2) The date the service was furnished or, in the case of inpatient 
hospital services, the date of discharge.
    Self-insured plan means a plan under which an individual, or a 
private or governmental entity, carries its own risk instead of taking 
out insurance with a carrier. The term includes a plan of an individual 
or other entity engaged in a business, trade, or profession, a plan of a 
non-profit organization such as a social, fraternal, labor, educational, 
religious, or professional organization, and the plan established by the 
Federal government to pay liability claims under the Federal Tort Claims 
Act.
    Underinsured motorist insurance means insurance under which the 
policyholder's level of protection against losses caused by another is 
extended to compensate for inadequate coverage in the other party's 
policy or plan.
    Uninsured motorist insurance means insurance under which the 
policyholder's insurer will pay for damages caused by a motorist who has 
no automobile liability insurance or who carries less than the amount of 
insurance required by law, or is underinsured.
    (c) Limitation on payment for services covered under no-fault 
insurance. Except as provided under Secs. 411.52 and 411.53 with respect 
to conditional payments. Medicare does not pay for the following:
    (1) Services for which payment has been made or can reasonably be 
expected to be made promptly under automobile no-fault insurance.
    (2) Services furnished on or after November 13, 1989 for which 
payment has been made or can reasonably be expected to be made promptly 
under any no-fault insurance other than automobile no-fault.

[54 FR 41734, Oct. 11, 1989, as amended at 55 FR 1820, Jan. 19, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 411.51  Beneficiary's responsibility with respect to no-fault insurance.

    (a) The beneficiary is responsible for taking whatever action is 
necessary to obtain any payment that can reasonably be expected under 
no-fault insurance.
    (b) Except as specified in Sec. 411.53, Medicare does not pay until 
the beneficiary has exhausted his or her remedies under no-fault 
insurance.
    (c) Except as specified in Sec. 411.53, Medicare does not pay for 
services that

[[Page 246]]

would have been covered by the no-fault insurance if the beneficiary had 
filed a proper claim.
    (d) However, if a claim is denied for reasons other than not being a 
proper claim, Medicare pays for the services if they are covered under 
Medicare.


<R05>
Sec. 411.52  Basis for conditional Medicare payment in liability cases.

    If HCFA has information that services for which Medicare benefits 
have been claimed are for treatment of an injury or illness that was 
allegedly caused by another party, a conditional Medicare payment may be 
made.


<R05>
Sec. 411.53  Basis for conditional Medicare payment in no-fault cases.

    A conditional Medicare payment may be made in no-fault cases under 
either of the following circumstances:
    (a) The beneficiary, or the provider or supplier, has filed a proper 
claim for no-fault insurance benefits but the intermediary or carrier 
determines that the no-fault insurer will not pay promptly for any 
reason other than the circumstances described in Sec. 411.32(a)(1). This 
includes cases in which the no-fault insurance carrier has denied the 
claim.
    (b) The beneficiary, because of physical or mental incapacity, 
failed to meet a claim-filing requirement stipulated in the policy.


<R05>
Sec. 411.54  Limitation on charges when a beneficiary has received a liability insurance payment or has a claim pending against a liability insurer.

    (a) Definition. As used in this section, Medicare-covered services 
means services for which Medicare benefits are payable or would be 
payable except for applicable Medicare deductible and coinsurance 
provisions. Medicare benefits are payable notwithstanding potential 
liability insurance payments, but are recoverable in accordance with 
Sec. 411.24.
    (b) Applicability. This section applies when a beneficiary has 
received a liability insurance payment or has a claim pending against a 
liability insurer for injuries or illness allegedly caused by another 
party.
    (c) Basic rules--(1) Itemized bill. A hospital must, upon request, 
furnish to the beneficiary or his or her representative an itemized bill 
of the hospital's charges.
    (2) Specific limitations. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of 
this section, the provider or supplier--
    (i) May not bill the liability insurer nor place a lien against the 
beneficiary's liability insurance settlement for Medicare covered 
services.
    (ii) May only bill Medicare for Medicare-covered services; and
    (iii) May bill the beneficiary only for applicable Medicare 
deductible and coinsurance amounts plus the amount of any charges that 
may be made to a beneficiary under Sec. 413.35 of this chapter (when 
cost limits are applied to the services) or under Sec. 489.32 of this 
chapter (when services are partially covered).
    (d) Exceptions--(1) Nonparticipating suppliers. The limitations of 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section do not apply if the services were 
furnished by a supplier that is not a participating supplier and has not 
accepted assignment for the services or has not claimed payment for them 
under Sec. 424.64 of this chapter.
    (2) Prepaid health plans. If the services were furnished through an 
organization that has a contract under section 1876 of the Act (that is, 
through an HMO or CMP), or through an organization that is paid under 
section 1833(a)(1)(A) of the Act (that is, through an HCPP) the rules of 
Sec. 417.528 of this chapter apply.
    (3) Special rules for Oregon. For the State of Oregon, because of a 
court decision, and in the absence of a reversal on appeal or a 
statutory clarification overturning the decision, there are the 
following special rules:
    (i) The limitations of paragraph (c)(2) of this section do not apply 
if the liability insurer pays within 120 days after the earlier of the 
following dates:
    (A) The date the hospital files a claim with the insurer or places a 
lien against a potential liability settlement.
    (B) The date the services were provided or, in the case of inpatient 
hospital services, the date of discharge.
    (ii) If the liability insurer does not pay within the 120-day 
period, the hospital must withdraw its claim or lien

[[Page 247]]

and comply with the limitations imposed by paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section.

   Subpart E--Limitations on Payment for Services Covered Under Group 
                    Health Plans: General Provisions

    Source:  60 FR 45362, Aug. 31, 1995, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 411.100  Basis and scope.

    (a) Statutory basis. (1) Section 1862(b) of the Act provides in part 
that Medicare is secondary payer, under specified conditions, for 
services covered under any of the following:
    (i) Group health plans of employers that employ at least 20 
employees and that cover Medicare beneficiaries age 65 or older who are 
covered under the plan by virtue of the individual's current employment 
status with an employer or the current employment status of a spouse of 
any age. (Section 1862(b)(1)(A))
    (ii) Group health plans (without regard to the number of individuals 
employed and irrespective of current employment status) that cover 
individuals who have ESRD. Except as provided in Sec. 411.163, group 
health plans are always primary payers throughout the first 18 months of 
ESRD-based Medicare eligibility or entitlement. (Section 1862(b)(1)(C))
    (iii) Large group health plans (that is, plans of employers that 
employ at least 100 employees) and that cover Medicare beneficiaries who 
are under age 65, entitled to Medicare on the basis of disability, and 
covered under the plan by virtue of the individual's or a family 
member's current employment status with an employer. (Section 
1862(b)(1)(B))
    (2) Sections 1862(b)(1)(A), (B), and (C) of the Act provide that 
group health plans and large group health plans may not take into 
account that the individuals described in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section are entitled to Medicare on the basis of age or disability, or 
eligible for, or entitled to Medicare on the basis of ESRD.
    (3) Section 1862(b)(1)(A)(i)(II) of the Act provides that group 
health plans of employers of 20 or more employees must provide to any 
employee or spouse age 65 or older the same benefits, under the same 
conditions, that it provides to employees and spouses under 65. The 
requirement applies regardless of whether the individual or spouse 65 or 
older is entitled to Medicare.
    (4) Section 1862(b)(1)(C)(ii) of the Act provides that group health 
plans may not differentiate in the benefits they provide between 
individuals who have ESRD and other individuals covered under the plan 
on the basis of the existence of ESRD, the need for renal dialysis, or 
in any other manner. Actions that constitute ``differentiating'' are 
listed in Sec. 411.161(b).
    (b) Scope. This subpart sets forth general rules pertinent to--
    (1) Medicare payment for services that are covered under a group 
health plan and are furnished to certain beneficiaries who are entitled 
on the basis of ESRD, age, or disability.
    (2) The prohibition against taking into account Medicare entitlement 
based on age or disability, or Medicare eligibility or entitlement based 
on ESRD.
    (3) The prohibition against differentiation in benefits between 
individuals who have ESRD and other individuals covered under the plan.
    (4) The requirement to provide to those 65 or over the same benefits 
under the same conditions as are provided to those under 65.
    (5) The appeals procedures for group health plans that HCFA 
determines are nonconforming plans.


<R05>
Sec. 411.101  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart and in subparts F through H of this part--
    COBRA stands for Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 
1985.
    Days means calendar days.
    Employee (subject to the special rules in Sec. 411.104) means an 
individual who--
    (1) Is working for an employer; or
    (2) Is not working for an employer but is receiving payments that 
are subject to FICA taxes, or would be subject to FICA taxes except that 
the employer is exempt from those taxes under the Internal Revenue Code.

[[Page 248]]

    Employer means, in addition to individuals (including self-employed 
persons) and organizations engaged in a trade or business, other 
entities exempt from income tax such as religious, charitable, and 
educational institutions, the governments of the United States, the 
individual States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American 
Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the District of Columbia, and 
the agencies, instrumentalities, and political subdivisions of these 
governments.
    FICA stands for the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, the law 
that imposes social security taxes on employers and employees under 
section 21 of the Internal Revenue Code.
    Group health plan (GHP) means any arrangement made by one or more 
employers or employee organizations to provide health care directly or 
through other methods such as insurance or reimbursement, to current or 
former employees, the employer, others associated or formerly associated 
with the employer in a business relationship, or their families, that--
    (1) Is of, or contributed to by, one or more employers or employee 
organizations.
    (2) If it involves more than one employer or employee organization, 
provides for common administration.
    (3) Provides substantially the same benefits or the same benefit 
options to all those enrolled under the arrangement.

The term includes self-insured plans, plans of governmental entities 
(Federal, State and local), and employee organization plans; that is, 
union plans, employee health and welfare funds or other employee 
organization plans. The term also includes employee-pay-all plans, which 
are plans under the auspices of one or more employers or employee 
organizations but which receive no financial contributions from them. 
The term does not include a plan that is unavailable to employees; for 
example, a plan only for self-employed persons.
    IRC stands for Internal Revenue Code.
    IRS stands for Internal Revenue Service.
    Large group health plan (LGHP) means a GHP that covers employees of 
either--
    (1) A single employer or employee organization that employed at 
least 100 full-time or part-time employees on 50 percent or more of its 
regular business days during the previous calendar year; or
    (2) Two or more employers, or employee organizations, at least one 
of which employed at least 100 full-time or part-time employees on 50 
percent or more of its regular business days during the previous 
calendar year.
    MSP stands for Medicare secondary payer.
    Multi-employer plan means a plan that is sponsored jointly by two or 
more employers (sometimes called a multiple-employer plan) or by 
employers and unions (sometimes under the Taft-Hartley law).
    Self-employed person encompasses consultants, owners of businesses, 
and directors of corporations, and members of the clergy and religious 
orders who are paid for their services by a religious body or other 
entity.
    Similarly situated individual means--
    (1) In the case of employees, other employees enrolled or seeking to 
enroll in the plan; and
    (2) In the case of other categories of individuals, other persons in 
any of those categories who are enrolled or seeking to enroll in the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 411.102  Basic prohibitions and requirements.

    (a) ESRD. (1) A group health plan of any size--(i) May not take into 
account the ESRD-based Medicare eligibility or entitlement of any 
individual who is covered or seeks to be covered under the plan; and
    (ii) May not differentiate in the benefits it provides between 
individuals with ESRD and other individuals covered under the plan, on 
the basis of the existence of ESRD, or the need for dialysis, or in any 
other manner.
    (2) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section do not 
prohibit a plan from paying benefits secondary to Medicare after the 
first 18 months of ESRD-based eligibility or entitlement.

[[Page 249]]

    (b) Age. A GHP of an employer or employee organization of at least 
20 employees--
    (1) May not take into account the age-based Medicare entitlement of 
an individual or spouse age 65 or older who is covered (or seeks to be 
covered) under the plan by virtue of current employment status; and
    (2) Must provide, to employees age 65 or older and to spouses age 65 
or older of employees of any age, the same benefits under the same 
conditions as it provides to employees and spouses under age 65.
    (c) Disability. A GHP of an employer or employee organization of at 
least 100 employees may not take into account the disability-based 
Medicare entitlement of any individual who is covered (or seeks to be 
covered) under the plan by virtue of current employment status.


<R05>
Sec. 411.103  Prohibition against financial and other incentives.

    (a) General rule. An employer or other entity (for example, an 
insurer) is prohibited from offering Medicare beneficiaries financial or 
other benefits as incentives not to enroll in, or to terminate 
enrollment in, a GHP that is, or would be, primary to Medicare. This 
prohibition precludes offering to Medicare beneficiaries an alternative 
to the employer primary plan (for example, coverage of prescription 
drugs) unless the beneficiary has primary coverage other than Medicare. 
An example would be primary coverage through his own or a spouse's 
employer.
    (b) Penalty for violation. (1) Any entity that violates the 
prohibition of paragraph (a) of this section is subject to a civil money 
penalty of up to $5,000 for each violation; and
    (2) The provisions of section 1128A of the Act (other than 
subsections (a) and (b)) apply to the civil money penalty of up to 
$5,000 in the same manner as the provisions apply to a penalty or 
proceeding under section 1128A(a).


<R05>
Sec. 411.104  Current employment status.

    (a) General rule. An individual has current employment status if--
    (1) The individual is actively working as an employee, is the 
employer (including a self-employed person), or is associated with the 
employer in a business relationship; or
    (2) The individual is not actively working and--
    (i) Is receiving disability benefits from an employer for up to 6 
months (the first 6 months of employer disability benefits are subject 
to FICA taxes); or
    (ii) Retains employment rights in the industry and has not had his 
employment terminated by the employer, if the employer provides the 
coverage (or has not had his membership in the employee organization 
terminated, if the employee organization provides the coverage), is not 
receiving disability benefits from an employer for more than 6 months, 
is not receiving disability benefits from Social Security, and has GHP 
coverage that is not pursuant to COBRA continuation coverage (26 U.S.C. 
4980B; 29 U.S.C. 1161-1168; 42 U.S.C. 300bb-1 et seq.). Whether or not 
the individual is receiving pay during the period of nonwork is not a 
factor.
    (b) Persons who retain employment rights. For purposes of paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, persons who retain employment rights include but 
are not limited to--
    (1) Persons who are furloughed, temporarily laid off, or who are on 
sick leave;
    (2) Teachers and seasonal workers who normally do not work 
throughout the year; and
    (3) Persons who have health coverage that extends beyond or between 
active employment periods; for example, based on an hours bank 
arrangement. (Active union members often have hours bank coverage.)
    (c) Coverage by virtue of current employment status. An individual 
has coverage by virtue of current employment status with an employer 
if--
    (1) the individual has GHP or LGHP coverage based on employment, 
including coverage based on a certain number of hours worked for that 
employer or a certain level of commissions earned from work for that 
employer at any time; and
    (2) the individual has current employment status with that employer, 
as defined in paragraph (a) of this section.

[[Page 250]]

    (d) Special rule: Self-employed person. A self-employed individual 
is considered to have GHP or LGHP coverage by virtue of current 
employment status during a particular tax year only if, during the 
preceding tax year, the individual's net earnings, from work in that 
year related to the employer that offers the group health coverage, are 
at least equal to the amount specified in section 211(b)(2) of the Act, 
which defines ``self-employment income'' for social security purposes.
    (e) Special Rule: members of religious orders and members of clergy. 
(1) Members of religious orders who have not taken a vow of poverty. A 
member of a religious order who has not taken a vow of poverty is 
considered to have current employment status with the religious order 
if--
    (i) The religious order pays FICA taxes on behalf of that member; or
    (ii) The individual is receiving cash remuneration from the 
religious order.
    (2) Members of religious orders who have taken a vow of poverty. A 
member of a religious order whose members are required to take a vow of 
poverty is not considered to be employed by the order if the services he 
or she performs as a member of the order are considered employment only 
because the order elects social security coverage under section 3121(r) 
of the IRC. This exemption applies retroactively to services performed 
as a member of the order, beginning with the effective dates of the MSP 
provisions for the aged and the disabled, respectively. The exemption 
does not apply to services performed for employers outside of the order.
    (3) Members of the clergy. A member of the clergy is considered to 
have current employment status with a church or other religious 
organization if the individual is receiving cash remuneration from the 
church or other religious organization for services rendered.
    (f) Special rule: Delayed compensation subject to FICA taxes. An 
individual who is not working is not considered an employee solely on 
the basis of receiving delayed compensation payments for previous 
periods of work even if those payments are subject to FICA taxes (or 
would be subject to FICA taxes if the employer were not exempt from 
paying those taxes). For example, an individual who is not working in 
1993 and receives payments subject to FICA taxes for work performed in 
1992 is not considered to be an employee in 1993 solely on the basis of 
receiving those payments.


<R05>
Sec. 411.106  Aggregation rules.

    The following rules apply in determining the number and size of 
employers, as required by the MSP provisions for the aged and disabled:
    (a) All employers that are treated as a single employer under 
subsection (a) or (b) of section 52 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 
of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 52 (a) and (b)) are treated as a single employer.
    (b) All employees of the members of an affiliated service group (as 
defined in section 414(m) of the IRC (26 U.S.C. 414m)) are treated as 
employed by a single employer.
    (c) Leased employees (as defined in section 414(n)(2) of the IRC (26 
U.S.C. 414(n)(2)) are treated as employees of the person for whom they 
perform services to the same extent as they are treated under section 
414(n) of the IRC.
    (d) In applying the IRC provisions identified in this section, HCFA 
relies upon regulations and decisions of the Secretary of the Treasury 
respecting those provisions.


<R05>
Sec. 411.108  Taking into account entitlement to Medicare.

    (a) Examples of actions that constitute ``taking into account''. 
Actions by GHPs or LGHPs that constitute taking into account that an 
individual is entitled to Medicare on the basis of ESRD, age, or 
disability (or eligible on the basis of ESRD) include, but are not 
limited to, the following:
    (1) Failure to pay primary benefits as required by subparts F, G, 
and H of this part 411.
    (2) Offering coverage that is secondary to Medicare to individuals 
entitled to Medicare.
    (3) Terminating coverage because the individual has become entitled 
to Medicare, except as permitted under COBRA continuation coverage 
provisions (26 U.S.C. 4980B(f)(2)(B)(iv); 29 U.S.C. 1162.(2)(D); and 42 
U.S.C. 300bb-2.(2)(D)).

[[Page 251]]

    (4) In the case of a LGHP, denying or terminating coverage because 
an individual is entitled to Medicare on the basis of disability without 
denying or terminating coverage for similarly situated individuals who 
are not entitled to Medicare on the basis of disability.
    (5) Imposing limitations on benefits for a Medicare entitled 
individual that do not apply to others enrolled in the plan, such as 
providing less comprehensive health care coverage, excluding benefits, 
reducing benefits, charging higher deductibles or coinsurance, providing 
for lower annual or lifetime benefit limits, or more restrictive pre-
existing illness limitations.
    (6) Charging a Medicare entitled individual higher premiums.
    (7) Requiring a Medicare entitled individual to wait longer for 
coverage to begin.
    (8) Paying providers and suppliers less for services furnished to a 
Medicare beneficiary than for the same services furnished to an enrollee 
who is not entitled to Medicare.
    (9) Providing misleading or incomplete information that would have 
the effect of inducing a Medicare entitled individual to reject the 
employer plan, thereby making Medicare the primary payer. An example of 
this would be informing the beneficiary of the right to accept or reject 
the employer plan but failing to inform the individual that, if he or 
she rejects the plan, the plan will not be permitted to provide or pay 
for secondary benefits.
    (10) Including in its health insurance cards, claims forms, or 
brochures distributed to beneficiaries, providers, and suppliers, 
instructions to bill Medicare first for services furnished to Medicare 
beneficiaries without stipulating that such action may be taken only 
when Medicare is the primary payer.
    (11) Refusing to enroll an individual for whom Medicare would be 
secondary payer, when enrollment is available to similarly situated 
individuals for whom Medicare would not be secondary payer.
    (b) Permissible actions. (1) If a GHP or LGHP makes benefit 
distinctions among various categories of individuals (distinctions 
unrelated to the fact that the individual is disabled, based, for 
instance, on length of time employed, occupation, or marital status), 
the GHP or LGHP may make the same distinctions among the same categories 
of individuals entitled to Medicare whose plan coverage is based on 
current employment status. For example, if a GHP or LGHP does not offer 
coverage to employees who have worked less than one year and who are not 
entitled to Medicare on the basis of disability or age, the GHP or LGHP 
is not required to offer coverage to employees who have worked less than 
one year and who are entitled to Medicare on the basis of disability or 
age.
    (2) A GHP or LGHP may pay benefits secondary to Medicare for an aged 
or disabled beneficiary who has current employment status if the plan 
coverage is COBRA continuation coverage because of reduced hours of 
work. Medicare is primary payer for this beneficiary because, although 
he or she has current employment status, the GHP coverage is by virtue 
of the COBRA law rather than by virtue of the current employment status.
    (3) A GHP may terminate COBRA continuation coverage of an individual 
who becomes entitled to Medicare on the basis of ESRD, when permitted 
under the COBRA provisions.

<R05>
Sec. 411.110  Basis for determination of nonconformance.

    (a) A ``determination of nonconformance'' is a HCFA determination 
that a GHP or LGHP is a nonconforming plan as provided in this section.
    (b) HCFA makes a determination of nonconformance for a GHP or LGHP 
that, at any time during a calendar year, fails to comply with any of 
the following statutory provisions:
    (1) The prohibition against taking into account that a beneficiary 
who is covered or seeks to be covered under the plan is entitled to 
Medicare on the basis of ESRD, age, or disability, or eligible on the 
basis of ESRD.
    (2) The nondifferentiation clause for individuals with ESRD.
    (3) The equal benefits clause for the working aged.
    (4) The obligation to refund conditional Medicare primary payments.

[[Page 252]]

    (c) HCFA may make a determination of nonconformance for a GHP or 
LGHP that fails to respond to a request for information, or to provide 
correct information, either voluntarily or in response to a HCFA 
request, on the plan's primary payment obligation with respect to a 
given beneficiary, if that failure contributes to either or both of the 
following:
    (1) Medicare erroneously making a primary payment.
    (2) A delay or foreclosure of HCFA's ability to recover an erroneous 
primary payment.


<R05>
Sec. 411.112  Documentation of conformance.

    (a) Acceptable documentation. HCFA may require a GHP or LGHP to 
demonstrate that it has complied with the Medicare secondary payer 
provisions and to submit supporting documentation by an official 
authorized to act on behalf of the entity, under penalty of perjury. The 
following are examples of documentation that may be acceptable:
    (1) A copy of the employer's plan or policy that specifies the 
services covered, conditions of coverage, benefit levels and limitations 
with respect to persons entitled to Medicare on the basis of ESRD, age, 
or disability as compared to the provisions applicable to other 
enrollees and potential enrollees.
    (2) An explanation of the plan's allegation that it does not owe 
HCFA any amount HCFA claims the plan owes as repayment for conditional 
or mistaken Medicare primary payments.
    (b) Lack of acceptable documentation. If a GHP or LGHP fails to 
provide acceptable evidence or documentation that it has complied with 
the MSP prohibitions and requirements set forth in Sec. 411.110, HCFA 
may make a determination of nonconformance for both the year in which 
the services were furnished and the year in which the request for 
information was made.


<R05>
Sec. 411.114  Determination of nonconformance.

    (a) Starting dates for determination of nonconformance. HCFA's 
authority to determine nonconformance of GHPs begins on the following 
dates:
    (1) On January 1, 1987 for MSP provisions that affect the disabled.
    (2) On December 20, 1989 for MSP provisions that affect ESRD 
beneficiaries and the working aged.
    (3) On August 10, 1993 for failure to refund mistaken Medicare 
primary payments.
    (b) Special rule for failure to repay. A GHP that fails to comply 
with Sec. 411.110 (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) in a particular year is 
nonconforming for that year. If, in a subsequent year, that plan fails 
to repay the resulting mistaken primary payments (in accordance with 
Sec. 411.110(a)(4)), the plan is also nonconforming for the subsequent 
year. For example, if a plan paid secondary for the working aged in 
1991, that plan was nonconforming for 1991. If in 1994 HCFA identifies 
mistaken primary payments attributable to the 1991 violation, and the 
plan refuses to repay, it is also nonconforming for 1994.


<R05>
Sec. 411.115  Notice of determination of nonconformance.

    (a) Notice to the GHP or LGHP. (1) If HCFA determines that a GHP or 
an LGHP is nonconforming with respect to a particular calendar year, 
HCFA mails to the plan written notice of the following:
    (i) The determination.
    (ii) The basis for the determination.
    (iii) The right of the parties to request a hearing.
    (iv) An explanation of the procedure for requesting a hearing.
    (v) The tax that may be assessed by the IRS in accordance with 
section 5000 of the IRC.
    (vi) The fact that if none of the parties requests a hearing within 
65 days from the date of its notice, the determination is binding on all 
parties unless it is reopened in accordance with Sec. 411.126.
    (2) The notice also states that the plan must, within 30 days from 
the date on its notice, submit to HCFA the names and addresses of all 
employers and employee organizations that contributed to the plan during 
the calendar year for which HCFA has determined nonconformance.
    (b) Notice to contributing employers and employee organizations. 
HCFA mails written notice of the determination,

[[Page 253]]

including all the information specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, to all contributing employers and employee organizations 
already known to HCFA or identified by the plan in accordance with 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Employers and employee organizations 
have 65 days from the date of their notice to request a hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 411.120  Appeals.

    (a) Parties to the determination. The parties to the determination 
are HCFA, the GHP or LGHP for which HCFA determined nonconformance, and 
any employers or employee organizations that contributed to the plan 
during the calendar year for which HCFA determined nonconformance.
    (b) Request for hearing. (1) A party's request for hearing must be 
in writing (not in facsimile or other electronic medium) and in the 
manner stipulated in the notice of nonconformance; it must be filed 
within 65 days from the date on the notice.
    (2) The request may include rationale showing why the parties 
believe that HCFA's determination is incorrect and supporting 
documentation.
    (3) A request is considered filed on the date it is received by the 
appropriate office, as shown by the receipt date stamped on the request.


<R05>
Sec. 411.121  Hearing procedures.

    (a) Nature of hearing. (1) If any of the parties requests a hearing 
within 65 days from the date on the notice of the determination of 
nonconformance, the HCFA Administrator appoints a hearing officer.
    (2) If no party files a request within the 65-day period, the 
initial determination of nonconformance is binding upon all parties 
unless it is reopened in accordance with Sec. 411.126.
    (3) If more than one party requests a hearing the hearing officer 
conducts a single hearing in which all parties may participate.
    (4) On the record review. Ordinarily, the hearing officer makes a 
decision based upon review of the data and documents on which HCFA based 
its determination of nonconformance and any other documentation 
submitted by any of the parties within 65 days from the date on the 
notice.
    (5) Oral hearing. The hearing officer may provide for an oral 
hearing either on his or her own motion or in response to a party's 
request if the party demonstrates to the hearing officer's satisfaction 
that an oral hearing is necessary. Within 30 days of receipt of the 
request, the hearing officer gives all known parties written notice of 
the request and whether the request for oral hearing is granted.
    (b) Notice of time and place of oral hearing. If the hearing officer 
provides an oral hearing, he or she gives all known parties written 
notice of the time and place of the hearing at least 30 days before the 
scheduled date.
    (c) Prehearing discovery. (1) The hearing officer may permit 
prehearing discovery if it is requested by a party at least 10 days 
before the scheduled date of the hearing.
    (2) If the hearing officer approves the request, he or she--
    (i) Provides a reasonable time for inspection and reproduction of 
documents; and
    (ii) In ruling on discovery matters, is guided by the Federal Rules 
of Civil Procedure. (28 U.S.C.A. Rules 26-37)
    (3) The hearing officer's orders on all discovery matters are final.
    (d) Conduct of hearing. The hearing officer determines the conduct 
of the hearing, including the order in which the evidence and the 
allegations are presented.
    (e) Evidence at hearing. (1) The hearing officer inquires into the 
matters at issue and may receive from all parties documentary and other 
evidence that is pertinent and material, including the testimony of 
witnesses, and evidence that would be inadmissible in a court of law.
    (2) Evidence may be received at any time before the conclusion of 
the hearing.
    (3) The hearing officer gives the parties opportunity for submission 
and consideration of evidence and arguments and, in ruling on the 
admissibility of evidence, excludes irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly 
repetitious evidence.
    (4) The hearing officer's ruling on admissibility of evidence is 
final and not subject to further review.

[[Page 254]]

    (f) Subpoenas. (1) The hearing officer may, either on his or her own 
motion or upon the request of any party, issue subpoenas for either or 
both of the following if they are reasonably necessary for full 
presentation of the case:
    (i) The attendance and testimony of witnesses.
    (ii) The production of books, records, correspondence, papers, or 
other documents that are relevant and material to any matter at issue.
    (2) A party that wishes the issuance of a subpoena must, at least 10 
days before the date fixed for the hearing, file with the hearing 
officer a written request that identifies the witnesses or documents to 
be produced and describes the address or location in sufficient detail 
to permit the witnesses or documents to be found.
    (3) The request for a subpoena must state the pertinent facts that 
the party expects to establish by the witnesses or documents and whether 
those facts could be established by other evidence without the use of a 
subpoena.
    (4) The hearing officer issues the subpoenas at his or her 
discretion, and HCFA assumes the cost of the issuance and the fees and 
mileage of any subpoenaed witness, in accordance with section 205(d) of 
the Act (42 U.S.C. 405(d)).
    (g) Witnesses. Witnesses at the hearing testify under oath or 
affirmation, unless excused by the hearing officer for cause. The 
hearing officer may examine the witnesses and shall allow the parties to 
examine and cross-examine witnesses.
    (h) Record of hearing. A complete record of the proceedings at the 
hearing is made and transcribed in all cases. It is made available to 
the parties upon request. The record is not closed until a decision has 
been issued.
    (i) Sources of hearing officer's authority. In the conduct of the 
hearing, the hearing officer complies with all the provisions of title 
XVIII of the Act and implementing regulations, as well as with HCFA 
Rulings issued under Sec. 401.108 of this chapter. The hearing officer 
gives great weight to interpretive rules, general statements of policy, 
and rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice established by 
HCFA.


<R05>
Sec. 411.122  Hearing officer's decision.

    (a) Timing. (1) If the decision is based on a review of the record, 
the hearing officer mails the decision to all known parties within 120 
days from the date of receipt of the request for hearing.
    (2) If the decision is based on an oral hearing, the hearing officer 
mails the decision to all known parties within 120 days from the

parties, by certified mail, return receipt requested, and includes a 
notice that the administrator may review the hearing decision at the 
request of a party or on his or her own motion.
    (c) Effect of hearing decision. The hearing officer's decision is 
the final Departmental decision and is binding upon all parties unless 
the Administrator chooses to review that decision in accordance with 
Sec. 411.124 or it is reopened by the hearing officer in accordance with 
Sec. 411.126.


<R05>
Sec. 411.124  Administrator's review of hearing decision.

    (a) Request for review. A party's request for review of a hearing 
officer's decision must be in writing (not in facsimile or other 
electronic medium) and must be received by the Administrator within 25 
days from the date on the decision.
    (b) Office of the Attorney Advisor responsibility. The Office of the 
Attorney Advisor examines the hearing officer's decision, the requests 
made by any of the parties or HCFA, and any submission made in 
accordance with the provisions of this section in order to assist the 
Administrator in deciding whether to review the decision.
    (c) Administrator's discretion. The Administrator may--
    (1) Review or decline to review the hearing officer's decision;
    (2) Exercise this discretion on his or her own motion or in response 
to a request from any of the parties; and

[[Page 255]]

    (3) Delegate review responsibility to the Deputy Administrator. (As 
used in this section, the term ``Administrator'' includes ``Deputy 
Administrator'' if review responsibility has been delegated.)
    (d) Basis for decision to review. In deciding whether to review a 
hearing officer's decision, the Administrator considers--
    (1) Whether the decision--
    (i) Is based on a correct interpretation of law, regulation, or HCFA 
Ruling;
    (ii) Is supported by substantial evidence;
    (iii) Presents a significant policy issue having a basis in law and 
regulations;
    (iv) Requires clarification, amplification, or an alternative legal 
basis for the decision; and
    (v) Is within the authority provided by statute, regulation, or HCFA 
Ruling; and
    (2) Whether review may lead to the issuance of a HCFA Ruling or 
other directive needed to clarify a statute or regulation.
    (e) Notice of decision to review or not to review. (1) The 
Administrator gives all parties prompt written notice of his or her 
decision to review or not to review.
    (2) The notice of a decision to review identifies the specific 
issues the Administrator will consider.
    (f) Response to notice of decision to review. (1) Within 20 days

hearing officer.
    (3) All communications from the parties concerning a hearing 
officer's decision being reviewed by the Administrator must be in 
writing (not in facsimile or other electronic medium) and must include a 
certification that copies have been sent to all other parties.
    (4) The Administrator does not consider any communication that does 
not meet the requirements of this paragraph.
    (g) Administrator's review decision. (1) The Administrator bases his 
or her decision on the following:
    (i) The entire record developed by the hearing officer.
    (ii) Any materials submitted in connection with the hearing or under 
paragraph (f) of this section.
    (iii) Generally known facts not subject to reasonable dispute.
    (2) The Administrator mails copies of the review decision to all 
parties within 120 days from the date of the hearing officer's decision.
    (3) The Administrator's review decision may affirm, reverse, or 
modify the hearing decision or may remand the case to the hearing 
officer.
    (h) Basis and effect of remand. (1) Basis. The bases for remand do 
not include the following:
    (i) Evidence that existed at the time of the hearing and that was 
known or could reasonably have been expected to be known.
    (ii) A court case that was either not available at the time of the

[[Page 256]]

officer's decision following remand, is the final Departmental decision 
and is binding on all parties unless the Administrator chooses to review 
the decision in accordance with this section, or the decision is 
reopened in accordance with Sec. 411.126.


<R05>
Sec. 411.126  Reopening of determinations and decisions.

    (a) A determination that a GHP or LGHP is a nonconforming GHP or the 
decision or revised decision of a hearing officer or of the HCFA 
Administrator may be reopened within 12 months from the date on the 
notice of determination or decision or revised decision, for any reason 
by the entity that issued the determination or decision.
    (b) The decision to reopen or not to reopen is not appealable.


<R05>
Sec. 411.130  Referral to Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

    (a) HCFA responsibility. After HCFA determines that a plan has been 
a nonconforming GHP in a particular year, it refers its determination to 
the IRS, but only after the parties have exhausted all HCFA appeal 
rights with respect to the determination.
    (b) IRS responsibility. The IRS administers section 5000 of the IRC, 
which imposes a tax on employers (other than governmental entities) and 
employee organizations that contribute to a nonconforming GHP. The tax 
is equal to 25 percent of the employer's or employee organization's 
expenses, incurred during the calendar year in which the plan is a 
nonconforming GHP, for each GHP, both conforming and nonconforming, to 
which the employer or employee organization contributes.


<R04>
Subpart F--Special Rules: Individuals Eligible or Entitled on the Basis 
         of ESRD, Who Are Also Covered Under Group Health Plans


<R05>
Sec. 411.160  Scope.

    This subpart sets forth special rules that apply to individuals who 
are eligible for, or entitled to, Medicare on the basis of ESRD. 
(Section 406.13 of this chapter contains the rules for eligibility and 
entitlement based on ESRD.)

[60 FR 45367, Aug. 31, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 411.161  Prohibition against taking into account Medicare eligibility or entitlement or differentiating benefits.

    (a) Taking into account. (1) Basic rule. A GHP may not take into 
account that an individual is eligible for or entitled to Medicare 
benefits on the basis of ESRD during the coordination period specified 
in Sec. 411.162(b) and (c). Examples of actions that constitute taking 
into account Medicare entitlement are listed in Sec. 411.108(a).
    (2) Applicability. This prohibition applies for ESRD-based Medicare 
eligibility to the same extent as for ESRD-based Medicare entitlement. 
An individual who has ESRD but who has not filed an application for 
entitlement to Medicare on that basis is eligible for Medicare based on 
ESRD for purposes of paragraphs (b)(2) and (c)(2) through (c)(4) of 
Sec. 411.162 if the individual meets the other requirements of 
Sec. 406.13 of this chapter.
    (3) Relation to COBRA continuation coverage. This rule does not 
prohibit the termination of GHP coverage under title X of COBRA when 
termination of that coverage is expressly permitted, upon entitlement to 
Medicare, under 26 U.S.C. 4980B(f)(2)(B)(iv); 29 U.S.C. 1162.(2)(D); or 
42 U.S.C. 300bb-2.(2)(D).\1\

[[Page 257]]

(Situations in which Medicare is secondary to COBRA continuation 
coverage are set forth in Sec. 411.162(a)(3).)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ COBRA requires that certain group health plans offer 
continuation of plan coverage for 18 to 36 months after the occurrence 
of certain ``qualifying events,'' including loss of employment or 
reduction of employment hours. Those are events that otherwise would 
result in loss of group health plan coverage unless the individual is 
given the opportunity to elect, and does so elect, to continue plan 
coverage at his or her own expense. With one exception, the COBRA 
amendments expressly permit termination of continuation coverage upon 
entitlement to Medicare. The exception is that the plan may not 
terminate continuation coverage of an individual (and his or her 
qualified dependents) if the individual retires on or before the date 
the employer substantially eliminates regular plan coverage by filing 
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy (26 U.S.C. 4980B(g)(1)(D) and 29 U.S.C. 
1167.(3)(C)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Nondifferentiation. (1) A GHP may not differentiate in the 
benefits it provides between individuals who have ESRD and others 
enrolled in the plan, on the basis of the existence of ESRD, or the need 
for renal dialysis, or in any other manner.
    (2) GHP actions that constitute differentiation in plan benefits 
(and that may also constitute ``taking into account'' Medicare 
eligibility or entitlement) include, but are not limited to the 
following:
    (i) Terminating coverage of individuals with ESRD, when there is no 
basis for such termination unrelated to ESRD (such as failure to pay 
plan premiums) that would result in termination for individuals who do 
not have ESRD.
    (ii) Imposing on persons who have ESRD, but not on others enrolled 
in the plan, benefit limitations such as less comprehensive health plan 
coverage, reductions in benefits, exclusions of benefits, a higher 
deductible or coinsurance, a longer waiting period, a lower annual or 
lifetime benefit limit, or more restrictive preexisting illness 
limitations.
    (iii) Charging individuals with ESRD higher premiums.
    (iv) Paying providers and suppliers less for services furnished to 
individuals who have ESRD than for the same services furnished to those 
who do not have ESRD, such as paying 80 percent of the Medicare rate for 
renal dialysis on behalf of a plan enrollee who has ESRD and the usual, 
reasonable and customary charge for renal dialysis on behalf of an 
enrollee who does not have ESRD.
    (v) Failure to cover routine maintenance dialysis or kidney 
transplants, when a plan covers other dialysis services or other organ 
transplants.
    (c) Uniform Limitations on particular services permissible. A plan 
is not prohibited from limiting covered utilization of a particular 
service as long as the limitation applies uniformly to all plan 
enrollees. For instance, if a plan limits its coverage of renal dialysis 
sessions to 30 per year for all plan enrollees, the plan would not be 
differentiating in the benefits it provides between plan enrollees who 
have ESRD and those who do not.
    (d) Benefits secondary to Medicare. (1) The prohibition against 
differentiation of benefits does not preclude a plan from paying 
benefits secondary to Medicare after the expiration of the coordination 
period described in Sec. 411.162(b) and (c), but a plan may not 
otherwise differentiate, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, 
in the benefits it provides.
    (2) Example--

    Mr. Smith works for employer A, and he and his wife are covered 
through employer A's GHP (Plan A). Neither is eligible for Medicare nor 
has ESRD. Mrs. Smith works for employer B, and is also covered by 
employer B's plan (Plan B). Plan A is more comprehensive than Plan B and 
covers certain items and services which Plan B does not cover, such as 
prescription drugs. If Mrs. Smith obtains a medical service, Plan B pays 
primary and Plan A pays secondary. That is, Plan A covers Plan B 
copayment amounts and items and services that Plan A covers but that 
Plan B does not.
    Mr. Jones also works for employer A, and he and his wife are covered 
by Plan A. Mrs. Jones does not have other GHP coverage. Mrs. Jones 
develops ESRD and becomes entitled to Medicare on that basis. Plan A 
pays primary to Medicare during the first 18 months of Medicare 
entitlement based on ESRD. When Medicare becomes the primary payer, the 
plan converts Mrs. Jones' coverage to a Medicare supplement policy. That 
policy pays Medicare deductible and coinsurance amounts but does not pay 
for items and services not covered by Medicare, which plan A would have 
covered. That conversion is impermissible because the plan is providing 
a lower level of coverage for Mrs. Jones, who has ESRD, than it provides 
for Mrs. Smith, who does not. In other words, if Plan A pays secondary 
to primary payers other than Medicare, it must provide the same level of 
secondary benefits when Medicare is primary in order to comply with the 
nondifferentiation provision.

[60 FR 45368, Aug. 31, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 411.162  Medicare benefits secondary to group health plan benefits.

    (a) General provisions. (1) Basic rule. Except as provided in 
Sec. 411.163 (with respect to certain individuals who are also entitled 
on the basis of age or disability), Medicare is secondary to any GHP 
(including a retirement plan),

[[Page 258]]

with respect to benefits that are payable to an individual who is 
entitled to Medicare on the basis of ESRD, for services furnished during 
any coordination period determined in accordance with paragraphs (b) and 
(c) of this section. (No Medicare benefits are payable on behalf of an 
individual who is eligible but not yet entitled.)
    (2) Medicare benefits secondary without regard to size of employer 
and beneficiary's employment status. The size of employer and employment 
status requirements of the MSP provisions for the aged and disabled do 
not apply with respect to ESRD beneficiaries.
    (3) COBRA continuation coverage. Medicare is secondary payer for 
benefits that a GHP--
    (i) Is required to keep in effect under COBRA continuation 
requirements (as explained in the footnote to Sec. 411.161(a)(3)), even 
after the individual becomes entitled to Medicare; or
    (ii) Voluntarily keeps in effect after the individual becomes 
entitled to Medicare on the basis of ESRD, even though not obligated to 
do so under the COBRA provisions.
    (4) Medicare payments during the coordination period. During the 
coordination period, HCFA makes Medicare payments as follows:
    (i) Primary payments only for Medicare covered services that are--
    (A) Furnished to Medicare beneficiaries who have declined to enroll 
in the GHP;
    (B) Not covered under the plan; \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ HCFA does not pay if noncoverage of services constitutes 
differentiation as prohibited by Sec. 411.161(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (C) Covered under the plan but not available to particular enrollees 
because they have exhausted their benefits; or
    (D) Furnished to individuals whose COBRA continuation coverage has 
been terminated because of the individual's Medicare entitlement.
    (ii) Secondary payments, within the limits specified in Secs. 411.32 
and 411.33, to supplement the amount paid by the GHP if that plan pays 
only a portion of the charge for the services.
    (b) Beginning of coordination period. (1) For individuals who start 
a course of maintenance dialysis or who receive a kidney transplant 
before December 1989, the coordination period begins with the earlier 
of--
    (i) The month in which the individual initiated a regular course of 
renal dialysis; or
    (ii) In the case of an individual who received a kidney transplant, 
the first month in which the individual became entitled to Medicare, or, 
if earlier, the first month for which the individual would have been 
entitled to Medicare benefits if he or she had filed an application for 
such benefits.
    (2) For individuals other than those specified in paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, the coordination period begins with the earlier of--
    (i) The first month in which the individual becomes entitled to 
Medicare part A on the basis of ESRD; or
    (ii) The first month the individual would have become entitled to 
Medicare part A on the basis of ESRD if he or she had filed an 
application for such benefits.
    (c) End of coordination period. (1) For individuals who start a 
regular course of renal dialysis or who receive a kidney transplant 
before December 1989, the coordination period ends with the earlier of 
the end of the 12th month of dialysis or the end of the 12th month of a 
transplant. The 12th month of dialysis may be any time from the 9th 
month through the 12th month of Medicare entitlement, depending on the 
extent to which the individual was subject to a waiting period before 
becoming entitled to Medicare.
    (2) The coordination period for the following individuals ends with 
the earlier of the 12th month of eligibility or the 12th month of 
entitlement to Medicare part A:
    (i) Individuals, other than those specified in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section, who became entitled to Medicare part A solely on the basis 
of ESRD during December 1989 and January 1990.
    (ii) Individuals, other than those specified in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section, who could have become entitled to Medicare Part A solely 
on the basis of ESRD during December 1989 and January 1990 if they had 
filed an application.

    (iii) Individuals who become entitled to Medicare part A on the 
basis of ESRD after September 1997.
    (iv) Individuals who can become entitled to Medicare part A on the 
basis of ESRD after September 1997.
    (3) The coordination period for the following individuals ends with 
the earlier of the end of the 18th month of eligibility or the 18th 
month of entitlement to Medicare part A:
    (i) Individuals, other than those specified in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section, who become entitled to Medicare part A on the basis of 
ESRD from February 1990 through April 1997.
    (ii) Individuals, other than those specified in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section, who could become entitled to Medicare part A on the basis 
of ESRD from February 1990 through April 1997 if they would file an 
application.
    (4) The coordination periods for the following individuals ends 
September 30, 1998:
    (i) Individuals who become entitled to Medicare part A on the basis 
of ESRD from May 1997, through September 1997.
    (ii) Individuals who could become entitled to Medicare part A on the 
basis of ESRD from May 1997, through September 1997, if they would file 
an application.
    (d) Examples. Based on the rules specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) 
of this section and the rules specified in Sec. 406.13 of this 
subchapter, the following examples illustrate how to determine, in 
different situations, the number of months during which Medicare is 
secondary payer.
    (1) An individual began dialysis on November 4, 1989. He did not 
initiate a course in self-dialysis training nor did he receive a kidney 
transplant during the first 3 calendar months of dialysis. Thus, he 
became entitled to Medicare on February 1, 1990. Since this individual 
began dialysis before December 1989, the 12-month period began with the 
first month of dialysis, November 1989, and ended October 31, 1990. The 
coordination period in this case is 9 months, February 1990 through 
October 1990.
    (2) An individual began dialysis on January 29, 1990. He did not 
initiate a course in self-dialysis training nor did he receive a kidney 
transplant during the first 3 calendar months of dialysis. Thus, he 
became entitled to Medicare on April 1, 1990. Since the individual began 
dialysis after November 1989, and became entitled to Medicare after 
January 1990, the coordination period began with the first month of 
entitlement, April 1990, and ended September 30, 1991, the end of the 
18th month of entitlement.
    (3) An individual began a regular course of maintenance dialysis on 
February 10, 1990. He did not initiate a course of self-dialysis 
training nor did he receive a kidney transplant during the first 3 
calendar months of dialysis. Thus, he became entitled to Medicare on May 
1, 1990. Medicare is secondary payer from May 1, 1990 through October 
1991, a total of 18 months.
    (4) The same facts exist as in the example under paragraph (d)(3), 
except that the individual began a course of self-dialysis training 
during the first 3 calendar months of dialysis. Thus, the effective date 
of his Medicare entitlement is February 1, 1990, and Medicare is 
secondary payer from February 1, 1990 through July 1991, a total of 18 
months.
    (5) An individual began dialysis on September 15, 1990. He did not 
initiate a course of self-dialysis training nor did he receive a kidney 
transplant during the first 3 calendar months of dialysis. Thus, he 
became entitled to Medicare effective December 1, 1990. Medicare is 
secondary payer from December 1, 1990 through May 1992, a total of 18 
months.
    (6) An individual began dialysis on November 17, 1990. He initiates 
a course of self-dialysis training in January 1991, and thus becomes 
entitled to Medicare effective November 1, 1990. Medicare is secondary 
payer from November 1, 1990, through April 1992, a total of 18 months.
    (7) An individual began a regular course of dialysis on December 10, 
1990. He does not initiate a course of self-dialysis training nor does 
he receive a kidney transplant. He decides to delay his enrollment in 
Medicare because his employer group health plan pays charges in full and 
he does not wish to incur part B premiums at this time. However, in 
March 1992, he files for

[[Page 260]]

part A and part B Medicare entitlement, and stipulates that he wants his 
Medicare entitlement to be effective March 1, 1992 (one year later than 
he could have become entitled). Since this individual could have been 
entitled to Medicare as early as March 1, 1991, Medicare is secondary 
payer only from March 1, 1992, through August 1992, a period of 6 
months.

(While Medicare is secondary payer for only the last 6 months of this 
period, the Medicare program is effectively secondary payer for the full 
coordination period, due to the fact that the individual delayed his 
Medicare enrollment on account of his employer plan coverage and 
Medicare made no payments at all during the deferred period.)
    (8) The same facts exist as in the example under paragraph (d)(7) of 
this section, except that the individual defers Medicare entitlement 
beyond August 1992. (For purposes of this example, Medicare entitlement 
is not retroactive, but rather takes effect after August 1992.) There 
would be no period during which Medicare is secondary payer in this 
situation. This is because Medicare entitlement does not begin until 
after the 18-month period expires as specified in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) 
of this section. Medicare would become primary payer as of the effective 
date of Medicare entitlement. The employer plan is required to pay 
primary from December 1, 1990, through August 1992, a total of 21 
months.
    (9) An individual becomes entitled to Medicare on December 1, 1997. 
The employer plan is primary payer, and Medicare is secondary payer, 
from December 1, 1997, through November 30, 1998, a period of 12 months. 
Medicare becomes primary payer on December 1, 1998, because the 
extension of the coordination period from 12 to 18 months applies only 
to items and services furnished before October 1, 1998.
    (10) An individual becomes entitled to Medicare on August 1, 1997. 
Medicare is secondary payer from August 1, 1997, through September 30, 
1998, a period of 14 months. Medicare becomes primary payer on October 
1, 1998, because the coordination period has expired.
    (e)  [Reserved]
    (f) Determinations for subsequent periods of ESRD eligibility. If an 
individual has more than one period of eligibility based on ESRD, a 
coordination period will be determined for each period of eligibility in 
accordance with this section.

Sec. 411.163  Coordination of benefits: Dual entitlement situations.

    (a) Basic rule. Coordination of benefits is governed by this section 
if an individual is eligible for or entitled to Medicare on the basis of 
ESRD and also entitled on the basis of age or disability.
    (b) Specific rules. \1\ (1) Coordination period ended before August 
1993. If the first 18 months of ESRD-based eligibility or entitlement 
ended before August 1993, Medicare was primary payer from the first 
month of dual eligibility or entitlement, regardless of when dual 
eligibility or entitlement began.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ A lawsuit was filed in United States District Court for the 
District of Columbia on May 5, 1995 (National Medical Care, Inc. v. 
Shalala, Civil Action No. 95-0860), challenging the implementation of 
one aspect of the OBRA '93 provisions with respect to group health plan 
retirement coverage. The court issued a preliminary injunction order on 
June 6, 1995, which enjoins the Secretary from applying the rule 
contained in Sec. 411.163(b)(4) for items and services furnished between 
August 10, 1993 and April 24, 1995, pending the court's decision on the 
merits. HCFA will modify the rules, if required, based on the final 
ruling by the court.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) First month of ESRD-based eligibility or entitlement and first 
month of dual eligibility/entitlement after February 1992 and before 
August 10, 1993. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, 
if the first month of ESRD-based eligibility or entitlement and first 
month of dual eligibility/entitlement were after February 1992 and 
before August 10, 1993, Medicare--
    (i) Is primary payer from the first month of dual eligibility/
entitlement through August 9, 1993;
    (ii) Is secondary payer from August 10, 1993, through the 18th month 
of ESRD-based eligibility or entitlement; and

[[Page 261]]

    (iii) Again becomes primary payer after the 18th month of ESRD-based 
eligibility or entitlement.
    (3) First month of ESRD-based eligibility or entitlement after 
February 1992 and first month of dual eligibility/entitlement after 
August 9, 1993. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, 
if the first month of ESRD-based eligibility or entitlement is after 
February 1992, and the first month of dual eligibility/entitlement is 
after August 9, 1993, the rules of Sec. 411.162(b) and (c) apply; that 
is, Medicare--
    (i) Is secondary payer during the first 18 months of ESRD-based 
eligibility or entitlement; and
    (ii) Becomes primary after the 18th month of ESRD-based eligibility 
or entitlement.
    (4) Medicare continues to be primary after an aged or disabled 
beneficiary becomes eligible on the basis of ESRD. (i) Applicability of 
the rule. Medicare remains the primary payer when an individual becomes 
eligible for Medicare based on ESRD if all of the following conditions 
are met:
    (A) The individual is already entitled on the basis of age or 
disability when he or she becomes eligible on the basis of ESRD.
    (B) The MSP prohibition against ``taking into account'' age-based or 
disability-based entitlement does not apply because plan coverage was 
not ``by virtue of current employment status'' or the employer had fewer 
than 20 employees (in the case of the aged) or fewer than 100 employees 
(in the case of the disabled).
    (C) The plan is paying secondary to Medicare because the plan had 
justifiably taken into account the age-based or disability-based 
entitlement.
    (ii) Effect of the rule. The plan may continue to pay benefits 
secondary to Medicare under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section. 
However, the plan may not differentiate in the services covered and the 
payments made between persons who have ESRD and those who do not.
    (c) Examples. (1) (Rule (b)(1).) Mr. A, who is covered by a GHP, 
became entitled to Medicare on the basis of ESRD in January 1992. On 
December 20, 1992, Mr. A attained age 65 and became entitled on the 
basis of age. Since prior law was still in effect (OBRA '93 amendment 
was effective in August 1993), Medicare became primary payer as of 
December 1992, when dual entitlement began.
    (2) (Rule (b)(2).) Miss B, who has GHP coverage, became entitled to 
Medicare on the basis of ESRD in July 1992, and also entitled on the 
basis of disability in June 1993. Medicare was primary payer from June 
1993 through August 9, 1993, because the plan permissibly took into 
account the ESRD-based entitlement (ESRD was not the ``sole'' basis of 
Medicare entitlement); secondary payer from August 10, 1993, through 
December 1993, the 18th month of ESRD-based entitlement (the plan is no 
longer permitted to take into account ESRD-based entitlement that is not 
the ``sole'' basis of Medicare entitlement); and again became primary 
payer beginning January 1994.
    (3) (Rule (b)(3).) Mr. C, who is 67 years old and entitled to 
Medicare on the basis of age, has GHP coverage by virtue of current 
employment status. Mr. C is diagnosed as having ESRD and begins a course 
of maintenance dialysis on June 27, 1993. Effective September 1, 1993, 
Mr. C. is eligible for Medicare on the basis of ESRD. Medicare, which 
was secondary because Mr. C's GHP coverage was by virtue of current 
employment, continues to be secondary payer through February 1995, the 
18th month of ESRD-based eligibility, and becomes primary payer 
beginning March 1995.
    (4) (Rule (b)(3).) Mr. D retired at age 62 and maintained GHP 
coverage as a retiree. In January 1994, at the age of 64, Mr. D became 
entitled to Medicare based on ESRD. Seven months into the 18-month 
coordination period (July 1994) Mr. D turned age 65. The coordination 
period continues without regard to age-based entitlement, with the 
retirement plan continuing to pay primary benefits through June 1995, 
the 18th month of ESRD-based entitlement. Thereafter, Medicare becomes 
the primary payer.
    (5) (Rule (b)(3).) Mrs. E retired at age 62 and maintained GHP 
coverage as a retiree. In July 1994, she simultaneously became eligible 
for Medicare based on ESRD (maintenance dialysis began in April 1994) 
and entitled based

[[Page 262]]

on age. The retirement plan must pay benefits primary to Medicare from 
July 1994 through December 1995, the first 18 months of ESRD-based 
eligibility. Thereafter, Medicare becomes the primary payer.
    (6) (Rule (b)(3).) Mr. F, who is 67 years of age, is working and has 
GHP coverage because of his employment status, subsequently develops 
ESRD, and begins a course of maintenance dialysis in October 1994. He 
becomes eligible for Medicare based on ESRD effective January 1, 1995. 
Under the working aged provision, the plan continues to pay primary to 
Medicare through December 1994. On January 1, 1995, the working aged 
provision ceases to apply and the ESRD MSP provision takes effect. In 
September 1995, Mr. F retires. The GHP must ignore Mr. F's retirement 
status and continue to pay primary to Medicare through June 1996, the 
end of the 18-month coordination period.
    (7) (Rule (b)(4).) Mrs. G, who is 67 years of age, is retired. She 
has GHP retirement coverage through her former employer. Her plan 
permissibly took into account her age-based Medicare entitlement when 
she retired and is paying benefits secondary to Medicare. Mrs. G 
subsequently develops ESRD and begins a course of maintenance dialysis 
in October 1995. She automatically becomes eligible for Medicare based 
on ESRD effective January 1, 1996. The plan continues to be secondary on 
the basis of Mrs. G's age-based entitlement as long as the plan does not 
differentiate in the services it provides to Mrs. G and does not do 
anything else that would constitute ``taking into account'' her ESRD-
based eligibility.

Sec. 411.165  Basis for conditional Medicare payments.

    (a) General rule. Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section, the Medicare intermediary or carrier may make a conditional 
payment if--
    (1) The beneficiary, the provider, or the supplier that has accepted 
assignment files a proper claim under the group health plan and the plan 
denies the claim in whole or in part; or
    (2) The beneficiary, because of physical or mental incapacity, fails 
to file a proper claim.
    (b) Exception. Medicare does not make conditional primary payments 
under either of the following circumstances:
    (1) The claim is denied for one of the following reasons:
    (i) It is alleged that the group health plan is secondary to 
Medicare.
    (ii) The group health plan limits its payments when the individual 
is entitled to Medicare.
    (iii) Failure to file a proper claim if that failure is for any 
reason other than the physical or mental incapacity of the beneficiary.
    (2) The group health plan fails to furnish information requested by 
HCFA and necessary to determine whether the employer plan is primary to 
Medicare.

 Subpart G--Special Rules: Aged Beneficiaries and Spouses Who Are Also 
                    Covered Under Group Health Plans


<R05>
Sec. 411.170  General provisions.

    (a) Basis. (1) This subpart is based on certain provisions of 
section 1862(b) of the Act, which impose specific requirements and 
limitations with respect to--
    (i) Individuals who are entitled to Medicare on the basis of age; 
and
    (ii) GHPs of at least one employer of 20 or more employees that 
cover those individuals.
    (2) Under these provisions, the following rules apply:
    (i) An employer is considered to employ 20 or more employees if the 
employer has 20 or more employees for each working day in each of 20 or 
more calendar weeks in the current calendar year or the preceding 
calendar year.
    (ii) The plan may not take into account the Medicare entitlement 
of--
    (A) An individual age 65 or older who is covered or seeks to be 
covered under the plan by virtue of current employment status; or

[[Page 263]]

    (B) The spouse, including divorced or common-law spouse age 65 or 
older of an individual (of any age) who is covered or seeks to be 
covered by virtue of current employment status. (Section 411.108 gives 
examples of actions that constitute ``taking into account.'')
    (iii) Regardless of whether entitled to Medicare, employees and 
spouses age 65 or older, including divorced or common-law spouses of 
employees of any age, are entitled to the same plan benefits under the 
same conditions as employees and spouses under age 65.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Determination of ``aged''. (1) An individual attains a 
particular age on the day preceding the anniversary of his or her birth.
    (2) The period during which an individual is considered to be 
``aged'' begins on the first day of the month in which that individual 
attains age 65.
    (3) For services furnished before May 1986, the period during which 
an individual is considered ``aged'' ends as follows:
    (i) For services furnished before July 18, 1984, it ends on the last 
day of the month in which the individual attains age 70.
    (ii) For services furnished between July 18, 1984 and April 30, 
1986, it ends on the last day of the month before the month the 
individual attains age 70.
    (4) For services furnished on or after May 1, 1986, the period has 
no upper age limit.

<R05>
Sec. 411.172  Medicare benefits secondary to group health plan benefits.

    (a) Conditions that the individual must meet. Medicare Part A and 
Part B benefits are secondary to benefits payable by a GHP for services 
furnished during any month in which the individual--
    (1) Is aged;
    (2) Is entitled to Medicare Part A benefits under Sec. 406.10 of 
this chapter; and
    (3) Meets one of the following conditions:
    (i) Is covered under a GHP of an employer that has at least 20 
employees (including a multi-employer plan in which at least one of the 
participating employers meets that condition), and coverage under the 
plan is by virtue of the individual's current employment status.
    (ii) Is the aged spouse (including a divorced or common-law spouse) 
of an individual (of any age) who is covered under a GHP described in 
paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section by virtue of the individual's 
current employment status.
    (b) Special rule for multi-employer plans. The requirements and 
limitations of paragraph (a) of this section and of (a)(2)(iii) of 
Sec. 411.170 do not apply with respect to individuals enrolled in a 
multi-employer plan if--
    (1) The individuals are covered by virtue of current employment 
status with an employer that has fewer than 20 employees; and
    (2) The plan requests an exception and identifies the individuals 
for whom it requests the exception as meeting the conditions specified 
in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (c) Refusal to accept group health plan coverage. An employee or 
spouse may refuse the health plan offered by the employer. If the 
employee or spouse refuses the plan--
    (1) Medicare is primary payer for that individual; and
    (2) The plan may not offer that individual coverage complementary to 
Medicare.
    (d) Reemployed retiree or annuitant. A reemployed retiree or 
annuitant who is covered by a GHP and who performs sufficient services 
to qualify for coverage on that basis (that is, other employees in the 
same category are provided health benefits) is considered covered ``by 
reason of current employment status'' even if:
    (1) The employer provides the same GHP coverage to retirees; or
    (2) The premiums for the plan are paid from a retirement or pension 
fund.
    (e) Secondary payments. Medicare pays secondary benefits, within the 
limitations specified in Secs. 411.32 and 411.33, to supplement the 
primary benefits paid by the group health plan if that plan pays only a 
portion of the charge for the services.
    (f) Disabled aged individuals who are considered employed. (1) For 
services furnished on or after November 12, 1985, and before July 17, 
1987, a disabled,

[[Page 264]]

nonworking individual age 65 or older was considered employed if he or 
she--
    (i) Was receiving, from an employer, disability payments that were 
subject to tax under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA); and
    (ii) For the month before the month of attainment of age 65, was not 
entitled to disability benefits under title II of the Act and 20 CFR 
404.315 of the SSA regulations.
    (2) For services furnished on or after July 17, 1987, an individual 
is considered employed if he or she receives, from an employer, 
disability benefits that are subject to tax under FICA, even if he or 
she was entitled to Social Security disability benefits before attaining 
age 65.
    (g) Individuals entitled to Medicare on the basis of age who are 
also eligible for or entitled to Medicare on the basis of ESRD. If an 
aged individual is, or could upon filing an application become, entitled 
to Medicare on the basis of ESRD, the coordination of benefits rules of 
subpart F of this part apply.

<R05>
Sec. 411.175  Basis for Medicare primary payments.

    (a) General rule. HCFA makes Medicare primary payments for covered 
services that are--
    (1) Furnished to Medicare beneficiaries who have declined to enroll 
in the GHP;
    (2) Not covered by the plan for any individuals or spouses who are 
enrolled by virtue of the individual's current employment status;
    (3) Covered under the plan but not available to particular 
individuals or spouses enrolled by virtue of current employment status 
because they have exhausted their benefits under the plan;
    (4) Furnished to individuals whose COBRA continuation coverage has 
been terminated because of the individual's Medicare entitlement; or
    (5) Covered under COBRA continuation coverage notwithstanding the 
individual's Medicare entitlement.
    (b) Conditional Medicare payments: Basic rule. Except as provided in 
paragraph (c) of this section, Medicare may make a conditional primary 
payment if--
    (1) The beneficiary, the provider, or the supplier that has accepted 
assignment has filed a proper claim under the group health plan and the 
plan has denied the claim in whole or in part; or
    (2) The beneficiary, because of physical or mental incapacity, 
failed to file proper claim.
    (c) Conditional primary payments: Exception. Medicare does not make 
conditional primary payments under either of the following 
circumstances:
    (1) The claim is denied for one of the following reasons:
    (i) It is alleged that the group health plan is secondary to 
Medicare.
    (ii) The plan limits its payments when the individual is entitled to 
Medicare.
    (iii) The plan covers the services for individuals or spouses who 
are enrolled in the plan by virtue of current employment status and are 
under age 65 but not for individuals and spouses who are enrolled on the 
same basis but are age 65 or older.
    (iv) Failure to file a proper claim if that failure is for any 
reason other than physical or mental incapacity of the beneficiary.
    (2) The group health plan fails to furnish information requested by 
HCFA and necessary to determine whether the employer plan is primary to 
Medicare.

    (a) This subpart is based on certain provisions of section 1862(b) 
of the Act, which impose specific requirements and limitations with 
respect to--
    (1) Individuals who are entitled to Medicare on the basis of 
disability; and
    (2) Large group health plans (LGHPs) that cover those individuals.

[[Page 265]]

    (b) Under these provisions, the LGHP may not take into account the 
Medicare entitlement of a disabled individual who is covered (or seeks 
to be covered) under the plan by virtue of his or her own current 
employment status or that of a member of his or her family. 
(Sec. 411.108 gives examples of actions that constitute taking into 
account.)


<R05>
Sec. 411.201  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart--
    Entitled to Medicare on the basis of disability means entitled or 
deemed entitled on the basis of entitlement to social security 
disability benefits or railroad retirement disability benefits. 
(Sec. 406.12 of this chapter explains the requirements an individual 
must meet in order to be entitled or deemed to be entitled to Medicare 
on the basis of disability.)
    Family member means a person who is enrolled in an LGHP based on 
another person's enrollment; for example, the enrollment of the named 
insured individual. Family members may include a spouse (including a 
divorced or common-law spouse), a natural, adopted, foster, or 
stepchild, a parent, or a sibling.


<R05>
Sec. 411.204  Medicare benefits secondary to LGHP benefits.

    (a) Medicare benefits are secondary to benefits payable by an LGHP 
for services furnished during any month in which the individual--
    (1) Is entitled to Medicare Part A benefits under Sec. 406.12 of 
this chapter;
    (2) Is covered under an LGHP; and
    (3) Has LGHP coverage by virtue of his or her own or a family 
member's current employment status.
    (b) Individuals entitled to Medicare on the basis of disability who 
are also eligible for, or entitled to, Medicare on the basis of ESRD. If 
a disabled individual is, or could upon filing an application become, 
entitled to Medicare on the basis of ESRD, the coordination of benefits 
rules of subpart F of this part apply.


<R05>
Sec. 411.206  Basis for Medicare primary payments and limits on secondary payments.

    (a) General rule. HCFA makes Medicare primary payments for services 
furnished to disabled beneficiaries covered under the LGHP by virtue of 
their own or a family member's current employment status if the services 
are--
    (1) Furnished to Medicare beneficiaries who have declined to enroll 
in the GHP;
    (2) Not covered under the plan for the disabled individual or 
similarly situated individuals;
    (3) Covered under the plan but not available to particular disabled 
individuals because they have exhausted their benefits under the plan;
    (4) Furnished to individuals whose COBRA continuation coverage has 
been terminated because of the individual's Medicare entitlement; or
    (5) Covered under COBRA continuation coverage notwithstanding the 
individual's Medicare entitlement.
    (b) Conditional primary payments: Basic rule. Except as provided in 
paragraph (c) of this section, HCFA may make a conditional Medicare 
primary payment for any of the following reasons:
    (1) The beneficiary, the provider, or the supplier that has accepted 
assignment has filed a proper claim with the LGHP and the LGHP has 
denied the claim in whole or in part.
    (2) The beneficiary, because of physical or mental incapacity, 
failed to file a proper claim.
    (c) Conditional primary payments: Exceptions. HCFA does not make 
conditional Medicare primary payments if--
    (1) The LGHP denies the claim in whole or in part for one of the 
following reasons:
    (i) It is alleged that the LGHP is secondary to Medicare.
    (ii) The LGHP limits its payments when the individual is entitled to 
Medicare.
    (iii) The LGHP does not provide the benefits to individuals who are 
entitled to Medicare on the basis of disability and covered under the 
plan by virtue of current employment status but does provide the 
benefits to other similarly situated individuals enrolled in the plan.
    (iv) The LGHP takes into account entitlement to Medicare in any 
other way.

[[Page 266]]

    (v) There was failure to file a proper claim for any reason other 
than physical or mental incapacity of the beneficiary.
    (2) The LGHP, an employer or employee organization, or the 
beneficiary fails to furnish information that is requested by HCFA and 
that is necessary to determine whether the LGHP is primary to Medicare.
    (d) Limit on secondary payments. The provisions of Sec. 411.172(e) 
also apply to services furnished to the disabled under this subpart.

     Subpart J--Physician Ownership of, and Referral of Patients or 
  Laboratory Specimens to, Entities Furnishing Clinical Laboratory or 
                          Other Health Services

    Source: 60 FR 41978, Aug. 14, 1995, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 411.350  Scope of subpart.

    (a) This subpart implements section 1877 of the Act, which generally 
prohibits a physician from making a referral under Medicare for clinical 
laboratory services to an entity with which the physician or a member of 
the physician's immediate family has a financial relationship.
    (b) This subpart does not provide for exceptions or immunity from 
civil or criminal prosecution or other sanctions applicable under any 
State laws or under Federal law other than section 1877 of the Act. For 
example, although a particular arrangement involving a physician's 
financial relationship with an entity may not prohibit the physician 
from making referrals to the entity under this subpart, the arrangement 
may nevertheless violate another provision of the Act or other laws 
administered by HHS, the Federal Trade Commission, the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service, or any other Federal 
or State agency.
    (c) This subpart requires, with some exceptions, that certain 
entities furnishing covered items or services under Part A or Part B 
report information concerning their ownership, investment, or 
compensation arrangements in the form, manner, and at the times 
specified by HCFA.


<R05>
Sec. 411.351  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, unless the context indicates otherwise:
    Clinical laboratory services means the biological, microbiological, 
serological, chemical, immunohematological, hematological, biophysical, 
cytological, pathological, or other examination of materials derived 
from the human body for the purpose of providing information for the 
diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of any disease or impairment of, or 
the assessment of the health of, human beings. These examinations also 
include procedures to determine, measure, or otherwise describe the 
presence or absence of various substances or organisms in the body.
    Compensation arrangement means any arrangement involving any 
remuneration, direct or indirect, between a physician (or a member of a 
physician's immediate family) and an entity.
    Direct supervision means supervision by a physician who is present 
in the office suite and immediately available to provide assistance and 
direction throughout the time services are being performed.
    Employee means any individual who, under the usual common law rules 
that apply in determining the employer-employee relationship (as applied 
for purposes of section 3121(d)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986), is considered to be employed by, or an employee of, an entity. 
(Application of these common law rules is discussed at 20 CFR 404.1007 
and 26 CFR 31.3121(d)-1(c).)
    Entity means a sole proprietorship, trust, corporation, partnership, 
foundation, not-for-profit corporation, or unincorporated association.
    Fair market value means the value in arm's-length transactions, 
consistent with the general market value. With respect to rentals or 
leases, fair market value means the value of rental property for general 
commercial purposes (not taking into account its intended use). In the 
case of a lease of space,

[[Page 267]]

this value may not be adjusted to reflect the additional value the 
prospective lessee or lessor would attribute to the proximity or 
convenience to the lessor when the lessor is a potential source of 
patient referrals to the lessee.
    Financial relationship refers to a direct or indirect relationship 
between a physician (or a member of a physician's immediate family) and 
an entity in which the physician or family member has--
    (1) An ownership or investment interest that exists in the entity 
through equity, debt, or other means and includes an interest in an 
entity that holds an ownership or investment interest in any entity 
providing laboratory services; or
    (2) A compensation arrangement with the entity.
    Group practice means a group of two or more physicians, legally 
organized as a partnership, professional corporation, foundation, not-
for-profit corporation, faculty practice plan, or similar association, 
that meets the following conditions:
    (1) Each physician who is a member of the group, as defined in this 
section, furnishes substantially the full range of patient care services 
that the physician routinely furnishes including medical care, 
consultation, diagnosis, and treatment through the joint use of shared 
office space, facilities, equipment, and personnel.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (2)(i) and (2)(ii) of this 
definition, substantially all of the patient care services of the 
physicians who are members of the group (that is, at least 75 percent of 
the total patient care services of the group practice members) are 
furnished through the group and billed in the name of the group and the 
amounts received are treated as receipts of the group. ``Patient care 
services'' are measured by the total patient care time each member 
spends on these services. For example, if a physician practices 40 hours 
a week and spends 30 hours on patient care services for a group 
practice, the physician has spent 75 percent of his or her time 
providing countable patient care services.
    (i) The ``substantially all'' test does not apply to any group 
practice that is located solely in an HPSA, as defined in this section, 
and
    (ii) For group practices located outside of an HPSA (as defined in 
this section) any time spent by group practice members providing 
services in an HPSA should not be used to calculate whether the group 
practice located outside the HPSA has met the ``substantially all'' 
test, regardless of whether the members' time in the HPSA is spent in a 
group practice, clinic, or office setting.
    (3) The practice expenses and income are distributed in accordance 
with methods previously determined.

In the case of faculty practice plans associated with a hospital, 
institution of higher education, or medical school that has an approved 
medical residency training program in which faculty practice plan 
physicians perform specialty and professional services, both within and 
outside the faculty practice, as well as perform other tasks such as 
research, this definition applies only to those services that are 
furnished within the faculty practice plan.
    Hospital means any separate legally organized operating entity plus 
any subsidiary, related, or other entities that perform services for the 
hospital's patients and for which the hospital bills. A ``hospital'' 
does not include entities that perform services for hospital patients 
``under arrangements'' with the hospital.
    HPSA means, for purposes of this regulation, an area designated as a 
health professional shortage area under section 332(a)(1)(A) of the 
Public Health Service Act for primary medical care professionals (in 
accordance with the criteria specified in 42 CFR part 5, appendix A, 
part I--Geographic Areas). In addition, with respect to dental, mental 
health, vision care, podiatric, and pharmacy services, an HPSA means an 
area designated as a health professional shortage area under section 
332(a)(1)(A) of the Public Health Service Act for dental professionals, 
mental health professionals, vision care professionals, podiatric 
professionals, and pharmacy professionals, respectively.
    Immediate family member or member of a physician's immediate family 
means husband or wife; natural or adoptive parent, child, or sibling; 
stepparent,

[[Page 268]]

stepchild, stepbrother, or stepsister; father-in-law, mother-in-law, 
son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law; 
grandparent or grandchild; and spouse of a grandparent or grandchild.
    Laboratory means an entity furnishing biological, microbiological, 
serological, chemical, immunohematological, hematological, biophysical, 
cytological, pathological, or other examination of materials derived 
from the human body for the purpose of providing information for the 
diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of any disease or impairment of, or 
the assessment of the health of, human beings. These examinations also 
include procedures to determine, measure, or otherwise describe the 
presence or absence of various substances or organisms in the body. 
Entities only collecting or preparing specimens (or both) or only 
serving as a mailing service and not performing testing are not 
considered laboratories.
    Members of the group means physician partners and full-time and 
part-time physician contractors and employees during the time they 
furnish services to patients of the group practice that are furnished 
through the group and are billed in the name of the group.
    Patient care services means any tasks performed by a group practice 
member that address the medical needs of specific patients, regardless 
of whether they involve direct patient encounters. They can include, for 
example, the services of physicians who do not directly treat patients, 
time spent by a physician consulting with other physicians, or time 
spent reviewing laboratory tests.
    Physician incentive plan means any compensation arrangement between 
an entity and a physician or physician group that may directly or 
indirectly have the effect of reducing or limiting services furnished 
with respect to individuals enrolled with the entity.
    Plan of care means the establishment by a physician of a course of 
diagnosis or treatment (or both) for a particular patient, including the 
ordering of items or services.
    Referral--
    (1) Means either of the following:
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this definition, the 
request by a physician for, or ordering of, any item or service for 
which payment may be made under Medicare Part B, including a request for 
a consultation with another physician and any test or procedure ordered 
by or to be performed by (or under the supervision of) that other 
physician.
    (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this definition, a 
request by a physician that includes the provision of laboratory 
services or the establishment of a plan of care by a physician that 
includes the provision of laboratory services.
    (2) Does not include a request by a pathologist for clinical 
diagnostic laboratory tests and pathological examination services if--
    (i) The request is part of a consultation initiated by another 
physician; and
    (ii) The tests or services are furnished by or under the supervision 
of the pathologist.
    Referring physician means a physician (or group practice) who makes 
a referral as defined in this section.
    Remuneration means any payment, discount, forgiveness of debt, or 
other benefit made directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash 
or in kind, except that the following are not considered remuneration:
    (1) The forgiveness of amounts owed for inaccurate tests or 
procedures, mistakenly performed tests or procedures, or the correction 
of minor billing errors.
    (2) The furnishing of items, devices, or supplies that are used 
solely to collect, transport, process, or store specimens for the entity 
furnishing the items, devices, or supplies or are used solely to order 
or communicate the results of tests or procedures for the entity.
    (3) A payment made by an insurer or a self-insured plan to a 
physician to satisfy a claim, submitted on a fee-for-service basis, for 
the furnishing of health services by that physician to an individual who 
is covered by a policy with the insurer or by the self-insured plan, 
if--
    (i) The health services are not furnished, and the payment is not 
made,

[[Page 269]]

under a contract or other arrangement between the insurer or the plan 
and the physician;
    (ii) The payment is made to the physician on behalf of the covered 
individual and would otherwise be made directly to the individual; and
    (iii) The amount of the payment is set in advance, does not exceed 
fair market value, and is not determined in a manner that takes into 
account directly or indirectly the volume or value of any referrals.
    Transaction means an instance or process of two or more persons 
doing business. An isolated transaction is one involving a single 
payment between two or more persons. A transaction that involves long-
term or installment payments is not considered an isolated transaction.


<R05>
Sec. 411.353  Prohibition on certain referrals by physicians and limitations on billing.

    (a) Prohibition on referrals. Except as provided in this subpart, a 
physician who has a financial relationship with an entity, or who has an 
immediate family member who has a financial relationship with the 
entity, may not make a referral to that entity for the furnishing of 
clinical laboratory services for which payment otherwise may be made 
under Medicare.
    (b) Limitations on billing. An entity that furnishes clinical 
laboratory services under a referral that is prohibited by paragraph (a) 
of this section may not present or cause to be presented a claim or bill 
to the Medicare program or to any individual, third party payer, or 
other entity for the clinical laboratory services performed under that 
referral.
    (c) Denial of payment. No Medicare payment may be made for a 
clinical laboratory service that is furnished under a prohibited 
referral.
    (d) Refunds. An entity that collects payment for a laboratory 
service that was performed under a prohibited referral must refund all 
collected amounts on a timely basis.


<R05>

privileges at another hospital or referring business to another entity.
    (f) Isolated transactions. Isolated financial transactions, such as 
a one-time sale of property or a practice, if all of the conditions set 
forth in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section are met with 
respect to an entity in the same manner as they apply to an employer. 
There can be no additional transactions between the parties for 6 months 
after the isolated transaction, except for transactions which are 
specifically excepted under the other provisions in Secs. 411.355 
through 411.357.
    (g) Arrangements with hospitals. (1) Until January 1, 1995, any

hospital services under section 1861(b)(3) of the Act.
    (2) The arrangement began before December 19, 1989, and has 
continued in effect without interruption since then.

[[Page 273]]

    (3) With respect to the clinical laboratory services covered under 
the arrangement, substantially all of these services furnished to 
patients of the hospital are furnished by the group under the 
arrangement.
    (4) The arrangement is in accordance with an agreement that is set 
out in writing and that specifies the services to be furnished by the 
parties and the compensation for services furnished under the agreement.
    (5) The compensation paid over the term of the agreement is 
consistent with fair market value, and the compensation per unit of 
services is fixed in advance and is not determined in a manner that 
takes into account the volume or value of any referrals or other 
business generated between the parties.
    (6) The compensation is provided in accordance with an agreement 
that would be commercially reasonable even if no referrals were made to 
the entity.
    (i) Payments by a physician. Payments made by a physician--

laboratory services; or
    (2) To an entity as compensation for other items or services that

<R05>
Sec. 411.360  Group practice attestation.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a group 
practice (as defined in section 1877(h)(4) of the Act and Sec. 411.351) 
must submit a written statement to its carrier annually to attest that, 
during the most recent 12-month period (calendar year, fiscal year, or 
immediately preceding 12-month period) 75 percent of the total patient 
care services of group practice members was furnished through the group, 
was billed under a billing number assigned to the group, and the amounts 
so received were treated as receipts of the group.
    (b) A newly-formed group practice (one in which physicians have 
recently begun to practice together) or any group practice that has been 
unable in the past to meet the requirements of section 1877(h)(4) of the 
Act must--
    (1) Submit a written statement to attest that, during the next 12-
month period (calendar year, fiscal year, or next 12 months), it expects 
to meet the 75-percent standard and will take measures to ensure the 
standard is met; and
    (2) At the end of the 12-month period, submit a written statement to 
attest that it met the 75-percent standard during that period, billed 
for those services under a billing number assigned to the group, and 
treated amounts received for those services as receipts of the group. If 
the group did not meet the standard, any Medicare payments made for 
clinical laboratory services furnished by the group during the 12-month 
period that were conditioned upon the standard being met are 
overpayments.
    (c) Once any group has chosen whether to use its fiscal year, the 
calendar year, or some other 12-month period, the group practice must 
adhere to this choice.
    (d) The attestation must contain a statement that the information 
furnished in the attestation is true and accurate and must be signed by 
a group representative.
    (e) A group that intends to meet the definition of a group practice 
in order to qualify for an exception described in Secs. 411.355 through 
411.357, must submit the attestation required by paragraph (a) or 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, as applicable, to its carrier no later 
than 60 days after receipt of the attestation instructions from its 
carrier.

<R05>
Sec. 411.361  Reporting requirements.

    (a) Basic rule. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 
all entities furnishing items or services for which payment may be made 
under Medicare must submit information to HCFA concerning their 
financial relationships (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section), 
in such form, manner, and at such times as HCFA specifies.
    (b) Exception. The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section do 
not apply to entities that provide 20 or fewer Part A and Part B items 
and services during a calendar year, or to designated health services 
provided outside the United States.

[[Page 274]]

    (c) Required information. The information submitted to HCFA under 
paragraph (a) of this section must include at least the following:
    (1) The name and unique physician identification number (UPIN) of 
each physician who has a financial relationship with the entity;

relative (as defined in Sec. 411.351) who has a financial relationship 
with the entity;
    (3) The covered items and services provided by the entity; and
    (4) With respect to each physician identified under paragraphs

relationship (including the extent and/or value of the ownership or 
investment interest or the compensation arrangement, if requested by 
HCFA).
    (d) Reportable financial relationships. For purposes of this 
section, a financial relationship is any ownership or investment 
interest or any compensation arrangement, as described in section 1877 
of the Act.
    (e) Form and timing of reports. Entities that are subject to the 
requirements of this section must submit the required information on a 
HCFA-prescribed form within the time period specified by the servicing 
carrier or intermediary. Entities are given at least 30 days from the 
date of the carrier's or intermediary's request to provide the initial 
information. Thereafter, an entity must provide updated information 
within 60 days from the date of any change in the submitted information. 
Entities must retain documentation sufficient to verify the information 
provided on the forms and, upon request, must make that documentation 
available to HCFA or the OIG.
    (f) Consequences of failure to report. Any person who is required, 
but fails, to submit information concerning his or her financial 
relationships in accordance with this section is subject to a civil 
money penalty of up to $10,000 for each day of the period beginning on 
the day following the applicable deadline established under paragraph 
(e) of this section until the information is submitted. Assessment of 
these penalties will comply with the applicable provisions of part 1003 
of this title.

            Subpart K--Payment for Certain Excluded Services


<R05>
Sec. 411.400  Payment for custodial care and services not reasonable and necessary.

    (a) Conditions for payment. Notwithstanding the exclusions set forth 
in Sec. 411.15 (g) and (k). Medicare pays for ``custodial care'' and 
``services not reasonable and necessary'' if the following conditions 
are met:
    (1) The services were funished by a provider or by a practitioner or 
supplier that had accepted assignment of benefits for those services.
    (2) Neither the beneficiary nor the provider, practitioner, or 
supplier knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that the 
services were excluded from coverage under Sec. 411.15 (g) or (k).
    (b) Time limits on payment. (1) Basic rule. Except as provided in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, payment may not be made for inpatient 
hospital care, posthospital SNF care, or home health services furnished 
after the earlier of the following:
    (i) The day on which the beneficiary has been determined, under 
Sec. 411.404, to have knowledge, actual or imputed, that the services 
were excluded from coverage by reason of Sec. 411.15(g) or 
Sec. 411.15(k).
    (ii) The day on which the provider has been determined, under 
Sec. 411.406 to have knowledge, actual or imputed, that the services are 
excluded from coverage by reason of Sec. 411.15(g) or Sec. 411.15(k).
    (2) Exception. Payment may be made for services furnished during the 
first day after the limit established in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, if the PRO or the intermediary determines that the additional 
period of one day is necessary for planning post-discharge care. It the 
PRO or the intermediary determines that yet another day is necessary for 
planning post-discharge

[[Page 275]]

care, payment may be made for services furnished during the second day 
after the limit established in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 411.402  Indemnification of beneficiary.

    (a) Conditions for indemnification. If Medicare payment is precluded 
because the conditions of Sec. 411.400(a)(2) are not met. Medicare 
indemnifies the beneficiary (and recovers from the provider, 
practitioner, or supplier), if the following conditions are met:
    (1) The beneficiary paid the provider, practitioner, or supplier 
some or all of the charges for the excluded services.
    (2) The beneficiary did not know and could not reasonably have been 
expected to know that the services were not covered.
    (3) The provider, practitioner, or supplier knew, or could 
reasonably have been expected to know that the services were not 
covered.
    (4) The beneficiary files a proper request for indemnification 
before the end of the sixth month after whichever of the following is 
later:
    (i) The month is which the beneficiary paid the provider, 
practitioner, or supplier.
    (ii) The month in which the intermediary or carrier notified the 
beneficiary (or someone on his or her behalf) that the beneficiary would 
not be liable for the services.

For good cause shown by the beneficiary, the 6-month period may be 
extended.
    (b) Amount of indemnification.<SUP>1</SUP> The amount of 
indemnification is the total that the beneficiary paid the provider, 
practitioner, or supplier.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ For services furnished before 1988, the indemnification amount 
was reduced by any deductible or coinsurance amounts that would have 
been applied if the services had been covered.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Effect of indemnification. The amount of indemnification is 
considered an overpayment to the provider, practitioner, or supplier, 
and as such is recoverable under this part or in accordance with other 
applicable provisions of law.


<R05>
Sec. 411.404  Criteria for determining that a beneficiary knew that services were excluded from coverage as custodial care or as not reasonable and necessary.

    (a) Basic rule. A beneficiary who receives services that constitute 
custodial care under Sec. 411.15(g) or that are not reasonable and 
necessary under Sec. 411.15(k), is considered to have known that the 
services were not covered if the criteria of paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
this section are met.
    (b) Written notice. Written notice has been given to the 
beneficiary, or to someone acting on his or her behalf, that the 
services were not covered because they did not meet Medicare coverage 
guidelines. A notice concerning similar or reasonably comparable 
services furnished on a previous occasion also meets this criterion. For 
example, program payment may not be made for the treatment of obesity, 
no matter what form the treatment may take. After the beneficiary who is 
treated for obesity with dietary control is informed in writing that 
Medicare will not pay for treatment of obesity, he or she will be 
presumed to know that there will be no Medicare payment for any form of 
subsequent treatment of this condition, including use of a combination 
of exercise, machine treatment, diet, and medication.
    (c) Source of notice. The notice was given by one of the following:
    (1) The PRO, intermediary, or carrier.
    (2) The group or committee responsible for utilization review for 
the provider that furnished the services.
    (3) The provider, practitioner, or supplier that furnished the 
service.


<R05>
Sec. 411.406  Criteria for determining that a provider, practitioner, or supplier knew that services were excluded from coverage as custodial care or as not 
          reasonable and necessary.

    (a) Basic rule. A provider, practitioner, or supplier that furnished 
services which constitute custodial care under Sec. 411.15(g) or that 
are not reasonable and necessary under Sec. 411.15(k) is considered to 
have known that the services were not covered if any one of the 
conditions specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section is 
met.

[[Page 276]]

    (b) Notice from the PRO, intermediary or carrier. The PRO, 
intermediary, or carrier had informed the provider, practitioner, or 
supplier that the services furnished were not covered, or that similar 
or reasonably comparable services were not covered.
    (c) Notice from the utilization review committee or the 
beneficiary's attending phyician. The utilization review group or 
committee for the provider or the beneficiary's attending physician had 
informed the provider that these services were not covered.
    (d) Notice from the provider, practitioner, or supplier to the 
beneficiary. Before the services were furnished, the provider, 
practitioner or supplier informed the beneficiary that--
    (1) The services were not covered; or
    (2) The beneficiary no longer needed covered services.
    (e) Knowledge based on experience, actual notice, or constructive 
notice. It is clear that the provider, practitioner, or supplier could 
have been expected to have known that the services were excluded from 
coverage on the basis of the following:
    (1) Its receipt of HCFA notices, including manual issuances, 
bulletins, or other written guides or directives from intermediaries, 
carriers, or PROs, including notification of PRO screening criteria 
specific to the condition of the beneficiary for whom the furnished 
services are at issue and of medical procedures subject to preadmission 
review by a PRO.
    (2) Federal Register publications containing notice of national 
coverage decisions or of other specifications regarding noncoverage of 
an item or service.
    (3) Its knowledge of what are considered acceptable standards of 
practice by the local medical community.

[54 FR 41734, Oct. 11, 1989, as amended at 60 FR 48425, Sept. 19, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 411.408  Refunds of amounts collected for physician services not reasonable and necessary, payment not accepted on an assignment-related basis.

    (a) Basic rule. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, 
a physician who furnishes a beneficiary services for which the physician 
does not undertake to claim payment on an assignment-related basis must 
refund any amounts collected from the beneficiary for services otherwise 
covered if Medicare payment is denied because the services are found to 
be not reasonable and necessary under Sec. 411.15(k).
    (b) Time limits for making refunds. A timely refund of any 
incorrectly collected amounts of money must be made to the beneficiary 
to whom the services were furnished. A refund is timely if--
    (1) A physician who does not request a review within 30 days after 
receipt of the denial notice makes the refund within that time period; 
or
    (2) A physician who files a request for review within 30 days after 
receipt of the denial notice makes the refund within 15 days after 
receiving notice of an initial adverse review determination, whether or 
not the physician further appeals the initial adverse review 
determination.
    (c) Notices and appeals. If payment is denied for nonassignment-
related claims because the services are found to be not reasonable and 
necessary, a notice of denial will be sent to both the physician and the 
beneficiary. The physician who does not accept assignment will have the 
same rights as a physician who submits claims on an assignment-related 
basis, as detailed in subpart H of part 405 and subpart B of part 473, 
to appeal the determination, and will be subject to the same time 
limitations.
    (d) When a refund is not required. A refund of any amounts collected 
for services not reasonable and necessary is not required if--
    (1) The physician did not know, and could not reasonably have been 
expected to know, that Medicare would not pay for the service; or
    (2) Before the service was provided--
    (i) The physician informed the beneficiary, or someone acting on the 
beneficiary's behalf, in writing that the physician believed Medicare 
was likely to deny payment for the specific service; and
    (ii) The beneficiary (or someone eligible to sign for the 
beneficiary under Sec. 424.36(b) of this chapter) signed a statement 
agreeing to pay for that service.

[[Page 277]]

    (e) Criteria for determining that a physician knew that services 
were excluded as not reasonable and necessary. A physician will be 
determined to have known that furnished services were excluded from 
coverage as not reasonable and necessary if one or more of the 
conditions in Sec. 411.406 of this subpart are met.
    (f) Acceptable evidence of prior notice to a beneficiary that 
Medicare was likely to deny payment for a particular service. To qualify 
for waiver of the refund requirement under paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section, the physician must inform the beneficiary (or person acting on 
his or her behalf) that the physician believes Medicare is likely to 
deny payment.
    (1) The notice must--
    (i) Be in writing, using approved notice language;
    (ii) Cite the particular service or services for which payment is 
likely to be denied; and
    (iii) Cite the physician's reasons for believing Medicare payment 
will be denied.
    (2) The notice is not acceptable evidence if--
    (i) The physician routinely gives this notice to all beneficiaries 
for whom he or she furnishes services; or
    (ii) The notice is no more than a statement to the effect that there 
is a possibility that Medicare may not pay for the service.
    (g) Applicability of sanctions to physicians who fail to make 
refunds under this section. A physician who knowingly and willfully 
fails to make refunds as required by this section may be subject to 
sanctions as provided for in chapter V, parts 1001, 1002, and 1003 of 
this title.

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 412.1  Scope of part.

    (a) Purpose. This part implements sections 1886(d) and (g) of the 
Act by establishing a prospective payment system for the operating costs 
of inpatient hospital services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries in 
cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1983 and a 
prospective payment system for the capital-related costs of inpatient 
hospital services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries in cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991. Under these prospective 
payment systems, payment for the operating and capital-related costs of 
inpatient hospital services furnished by hospitals subject to the 
systems (generally, short-term, acute-care hospitals) is made on the 
basis of prospectively determined rates and applied on a per discharge 
basis. Payment for other costs related to inpatient hospital services 
(organ acquisition costs incurred by hospitals with approved organ 
transplantation centers, the costs of qualified nonphysician 
anesthetist's services, as described in Sec. 412.113(c), and direct 
costs of approved nursing and allied health educational programs) is 
made on a reasonable cost basis. Payment for the direct costs of 
graduate medical education is made on a per resident amount basis in 
accordance with Sec. 413.86 of this chapter. Additional payments are 
made for outlier cases, bad debts, indirect medical education costs, and 
for serving a disproportionate share of low-income patients. Under 
either prospective payment system, a hospital may keep the difference 
between its prospective payment rate and its operating or capital-
related costs incurred in furnishing inpatient services, and the 
hospital is at risk for inpatient operating or inpatient capital-related 
costs that exceed its payment rate.
    (b) Summary of content. This subpart describes the basis of payment 
for inpatient hospital services under the prospective payment systems, 
and sets forth the general basis of these systems. Subpart B of this 
part sets forth the classifications of hospitals that are included in 
and excluded from the prospective payment systems, and sets forth 
requirements governing the inclusion or exclusion of hospitals in the 
systems as a result of changes in their classification. Subpart C sets 
forth certain conditions that must be met for a hospital to receive 
payment under the prospective payment systems. Subpart D sets forth the 
basic methodology by which prospective payment rates for inpatient 
operating costs are determined. Subpart E describes the transition rate-
setting methods that are used to determine transition payment rates for 
inpatient operating costs during the first four years of the prospective 
payment system. Subpart F sets forth

[[Page 280]]

the methodology for determining additional payments for outlier cases. 
Subpart G sets forth rules for special treatment of certain facilities 
under the prospective payment system for inpatient operating costs. 
Subpart H describes the types, amounts, and methods of payment to 
hospitals under the prospective payment system for inpatient operating 
costs. Subpart K describes how the prospective payment system for 
inpatient operating costs is implemented for hospitals located in Puerto 
Rico. Subpart L sets forth the procedures and criteria concerning 
applications from hospitals to the Medicare Geographic Classification 
Review Board for geographic redesignation. Subpart M describes how the 
prospective payment system for inpatient capital-related costs is 
implemented effective with cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 1991.

<R05>
Sec. 412.2  Basis of payment.

    (a) Payment on a per discharge basis. Under both the inpatient 
operating and inpatient capital-related prospective payment systems, 
hospitals are paid a predetermined amount per discharge for inpatient 
hospital services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. The prospective 
payment rate for each discharge (as defined in Sec. 412.4) is determined 
according to the methodology described in subpart D, E, or G of this 
part, as appropriate, for operating costs, and according to the 
methodology described in subpart M of this part for capital-related 
costs. An additional payment is made for both inpatient operating and 
inpatient capital-related costs, in accordance with subpart F of this 
part, for cases that have an atypically long length of stay or are 
extraordinarily costly to treat.
    (b) Payment in full. (1) The prospective payment amount paid for 
inpatient hospital services is the total Medicare payment for the 
inpatient operating costs (as described in paragraph (c) of this 
section) and the inpatient capital-related costs (as described in 
paragraph (d) of this section) incurred in furnishing services covered 
by the Medicare program.
    (2) The full prospective payment amount, as determined under subpart 
D, E, or G and under subpart M of this part, is made for each stay 
during which there is at least one Medicare payable day of care. Payable 
days of care, for purposes of this paragraph include the following:
    (i) Limitation of liability days payable under the payment 
procedures for custodial care and services that are not reasonable and 
necessary as specified in Sec. 411.400 of this chapter.
    (ii) Guarantee of payment days, as authorized under Sec. 409.68 of 
this chapter, for inpatient hospital services furnished to an individual 
whom the hospital has reason to believe is entitled to Medicare benefits 
at the time of admission.
    (c) Inpatient operating costs. The prospective payment system 
provides a payment amount for inpatient operating costs, including--
    (1) Operating costs for routine services (as described in 
Sec. 413.53(b) of this chapter), such as the costs of room, board, and 
routine nursing services;
    (2) Operating costs for ancillary services, such as radiology and 
laboratory services furnished to hospital inpatients;
    (3) Special care unit operating costs (intensive care type unit 
services, as described in Sec. 413.53(b) of this chapter);
    (4) Malpractice insurance costs related to services furnished to 
inpatients; and
    (5) Certain preadmission services furnished by the hospital or by an 
entity wholly owned or operated by the hospital (that is, any entity for 
which the hospital itself is the sole owner or operator) to the patient 
during the 3 days immediately preceding the date of the patient's 
admission to the hospital. A hospital is considered the sole operator of 
an entity if the hospital has exclusive responsibility for conducting or 
overseeing the entity's routine operations, regardless of whether the 
hospital also has policymaking authority over the entity. The specific 
preadmission services (other than ambulance services) included in the 
inpatient hospital operating costs are the following:

[[Page 281]]

    (i) Diagnostic services (including clinical diagnostic laboratory 
tests) furnished on or after January 1, 1991.
    (ii) Other services related to the admission furnished on or after 
October 1, 1991. Other services related to the admission means services 
(other than diagnostic services) that are furnished in connection with 
the principal diagnosis that requires the beneficiary to be admitted as 
an inpatient.
    (d) Inpatient capital-related costs. For cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after October 1, 1991, the capital prospective payment 
system provides a payment amount for inpatient hospital capital-related 
costs as described in part 413, subpart G of this chapter.
    (e) Excluded costs. The following inpatient hospital costs are 
excluded from the prospective payment amounts and are paid for on a 
reasonable cost basis:
    (1) Capital-related costs for cost reporting periods beginning 
before October 1, 1991, and an allowance for return on equity, as 
described in Secs. 413.130 and 413.157, respectively, of this chapter.
    (2) Direct medical education costs for approved nursing and allied 
health education programs as described in Sec. 413.85 of this chapter.
    (3) Costs for direct medical and surgical services of physicians in 
teaching hospitals exercising the election in Sec. 405.521 of this 
chapter.
    (4) Heart, kidney, liver, and lung acquisition costs incurred by 
approved transplantation centers.
    (5) The costs of qualified nonphysician anesthetists' services, as 
described in Sec. 412.113(c).
    (f) Additional payments to hospitals. In addition to payments based 
on the prospective payment rates for inpatient operating costs and 
inpatient capital-

[[Page 282]]


related costs, hospitals receive payments for the following:
    (1) Outlier cases, as described in subpart F of this part.
    (2) The indirect costs of graduate medical education, as specified 
in subparts F and G of this part and in Sec. 412.105 for inpatient 
operating costs and in Sec. 412.322 for inpatient capital-related costs.
    (3) Costs excluded from the prospective payment rates under 
paragraph (e) of this section, as provided in Sec. 412.115.
    (4) Bad debts of Medicare beneficiaries, as provided in 
Sec. 412.115(a).
    (5) ESRD beneficiary discharges if such discharges are ten percent 
or more of the hospital's total Medicare discharges, as provided in 
Sec. 412.104.
    (6) Serving a disproportionate share of low-income patients, as 
provided in Sec. 412.106 for inpatient operating costs and Sec. 412.320 
for inpatient capital-related costs.
    (7) The direct graduate medical education costs for approved 
residency programs in medicine, osteopathy, dentistry, and podiatry as 
described in Sec. 413.86 of this chapter.
    (8) For discharges on or after June 19, 1990, and before October 1, 
1994, and for discharges on or after October 1, 1997, a payment amount 
per unit for blood clotting factor provided to Medicare inpatients who 
have hemophilia.

<R05>
Sec. 412.4  Discharges and transfers.

    (a) Discharges. A hospital inpatient is considered discharged when 
any of the following occurs:
    (1) The patient is formally released from the hospital. (Release of 
the patient to another hospital as described in paragraph (b) of this 
section, or a leave of absence from the hospital, will not be recognized 
as a discharge for the purpose of determining payment under the 
prospective payment systems.)
    (2) The patient dies in the hospital.
    (3) The patient is transferred to a hospital or unit that is 
excluded from the prospective payment systems under subpart B of this 
part.
    (b) Transfers. Except as provided under paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, a discharge of a hospital inpatient is not counted for purposes 
of the prospective payment systems when the patient is transferred--
    (1) From one inpatient area or unit of the hospital to another area 
or unit of the hospital;
    (2) From the care of a hospital paid under this section to the care 
of another such hospital; or
    (3) From the care of a hospital paid under this section to the care 
of another hospital--
    (i) That is excluded from the prospective payment systems because of 
participation in an approved statewide cost control program or 
demonstration; or
    (ii) Whose first cost reporting period under the prospective payment 
systems has not yet begun.
    (c) Payment in full to the discharging hospital. The hospital 
discharging an inpatient (under paragraph (a) of this section) is paid 
in full, in accordance with Sec. 412.2(b).
    (d) Payment to a hospital transferring an inpatient to another 
hospital. (1) A hospital that transfers an inpatient under the 
circumstances described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section, 
is paid a graduated per diem rate for each day of the patient's stay in 
that hospital, not to exceed the amount that would have been paid under 
subparts D, E, and M of this part if the patient had been discharged to 
another setting. The per diem rate is determined by dividing the 
appropriate prospective payment rates (as determined under subparts D, 
E, and M of this part) by the average length of stay for the specific 
Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) into which the case falls. Payment is 
graduated by paying twice the per diem amount for the first day of the 
saty, and the per diem amount for each subsequent day, up to the limit 
described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (2) However, if a discharge is classified into DRG No. 385 
(Neonates, died or transferred) or DRG No. 456 (Burns,

[[Page 283]]

transferred to another acute care facility), the transferring hospital 
is paid in accordance with Sec. 412.2(b).
    (3) Effective with discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1984, 
a transferring hospital may qualify for an additional payment for 
extraordinarily high-cost cases that meet the criteria for cost outliers 
as described in subpart F of this part.

[50 FR 12741, Mar. 29, 1985, as amended at 50 FR 30172, July 24, 1985; 
57 FR 39819, Sept. 1, 1992; 60 FR 45846, Sept. 1, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 412.6  Cost reporting periods subject to the prospective payment systems.

    (a) Initial cost reporting period for each prospective payment 
system. (1) Each subject hospital is paid under the prospective payment 
system for operating costs for inpatient hospital services effective 
with the hospital's first cost reporting period beginning on or after 
October 1, 1983 and for inpatient capital-related costs effective with 
the hospital's first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 
1, 1991.
    (2) The hospital is paid the applicable prospective payment rate for 
inpatient operating costs and capital-related costs for each discharge 
occurring on or after the first day of its first cost reporting period 
subject to the applicable prospective payment system.
    (3) If a discharged beneficiary was admitted to the hospital before 
the first day of the hospital's first cost reporting period subject to 
the prospective payment system for inpatient operating costs, the 
reasonable costs of services furnished before that day are paid under 
the cost reimbursement provisions of part 413 of this chapter. For such 
discharges, the amount otherwise payable under the applicable 
prospective payment rate is reduced by the amount paid on a reasonable 
cost basis for inpatient hospital services furnished to that beneficiary 
during the hospital stay. If the amount paid under reasonable cost 
exceeds the inpatient operating prospective payment amount, the 
reduction is limited to the inpatient operating prospective payment 
amount.
    (b) Changes in cost reporting periods. HCFA recognizes a change in a 
hospital's cost reporting period made after November 30, 1982 only if 
the change has been requested in writing by the hospital and approved by 
the intermediary in accordance with Sec. 413.24(f)(3) of this chapter.

[57 FR 39819, Sept. 1, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 412.8  Publication of schedules for determining prospective payment rates.

    (a) Initial prospective payment rates--(1) For inpatient operating 
costs. Initial prospective payment rates for inpatient operating costs 
(for the period October 1, 1983 through September 30, 1984) were 
determined in accordance with documents published in the Federal 
Register on September 1, 1983 (48 FR 39838), and January 3, 1984 (49 FR 
324).
    (2) For inpatient capital-related costs. Initial prospective payment 
rates for inpatient capital-related costs (for the period October 1, 
1991 through September 30, 1992) were determined in accordance with the 
final rule published in the Federal Register on August 30, 1991 (56 FR 
43196).
    (b) Annual publication of schedule for determining prospective 
payment rates. (1) HCFA proposes changes in the methods, amounts, and 
factors used to determine inpatient prospective payment rates in a 
Federal Register document published for public comment not later than 
the April 1 before the beginning of the Federal fiscal year in which the 
proposed changes would apply.
    (2) HCFA publishes a Federal Register document setting forth final 
methods, amounts, and factors for determining inpatient prospective 
payment rates not later than the August 1 before the Federal fiscal year 
in which the rates would apply.

[57 FR 39820, Sept. 1, 1992, as amended at 62 FR 46025, Aug. 29, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 412.10  Changes in the DRG classification system.

    (a) General rule. HCFA issues changes in the DRG classification 
system in a Federal Register notice at least annually. Except as 
specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the DRG changes are 
effective prospectively with discharges occurring on or after the same 
date the payment rates are effective.

[[Page 284]]

    (b) Basis for changes in the DRG classification system. All changes 
in the DRG classification system are made using the principles 
established for the DRG system. This means that cases are classified so 
each DRG is--
    (1) Clinically coherent; and
    (2) Embraces an acceptable range of resource consumption.
    (c) Interim coverage changes--(1) Criteria. HCFA makes interim 
changes to the DRG classification system during the Federal fiscal year 
to incorporate items and services newly covered under Medicare.
    (2) Implementation and effective date. HCFA issues interim coverage 
changes through its administrative issuance system and makes the change 
effective as soon as is administratively feasible.
    (3) Publication for comment. HCFA publishes any change made under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section in the next annual notice of changes to 
the DRG classification system published in accordance with paragraph (a) 
of this section.
    (d) Interim changes to correct omissions and inequities--(1) 
Criteria. HCFA makes interim changes to the DRG classification system to 
correct a serious omission or inequity in the system only if failure to 
make the changes would have--
    (i) A potentially substantial adverse impact on the health and 
safety of beneficiaries; or
    (ii) A significant and unwarranted fiscal impact on hospitals or the 
Medicare program.
    (2) Publication and effective date. HCFA publishes these changes in 
the Federal Register in a final notice with comment period with a 
prospective effective date. The change is also published for public 
information in the next annual notice of changes to the DRG 
classification system published in accordance with paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (e) Review by ProPAC. Changes published annually in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section are subject to review and comment by 
ProPAC upon publication. Interim changes to the DRG classification 
system that are made in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this 
section are subject to review by ProPAC before implementation.

     Subpart B--Hospital Services Subject to and Excluded From the 
Prospective Payment Systems for Inpatient Operating Costs and Inpatient 
                          Capital-Related Costs


<R05>
Sec. 412.20  Hospital services subject to the prospective payment systems.

    (a) Except for services described in paragraph (b) of this section, 
all covered inpatient hospital services furnished to beneficiaries 
during subject cost reporting periods are paid for under the prospective 
payment systems.
    (b) Inpatient hospital services will not be paid for under the 
prospective payment systems under any of the following circumstances:
    (1) The services are furnished by a hospital (or hospital unit) 
explicitly excluded from the prospective payment systems under 
Secs. 412.23, 412.25, 412.27, and 412.29.
    (2) The services are emergency services furnished by a 
nonparticipating hospital in accordance with Sec. 424.103 of this 
chapter.
    (3) The services are paid for by an HMO or competitive medical plan 
(CMP) that elects not to have HCFA make payments directly to a hospital 
for inpatient hospital services furnished to the HMO's or CMP's Medicare 
enrollees, as provided in Sec. 417.240(d) and Sec. 417.586 of this 
chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 412.22  Excluded hospitals and hospital units: General rules.

    (a) Criteria. Subject to the criteria set forth in paragraph (e) of 
this section, a hospital is excluded from the prospective payment 
systems if it meets the criteria for one or more of the excluded 
classifications described in Sec. 412.23.
    (b) Cost reimbursement. Except for those hospitals specified in 
paragraph

[[Page 285]]

(c) of this section, all excluded hospitals (and excluded hospital 
units, as described in Secs. 412.23 through 412.29) are reimbursed under 
the cost reimbursement rules set forth in part 413 of this chapter, and 
are subject to the ceiling on the rate of hospital cost increases 
described in Sec. 413.40 of this chapter.
    (c) Special payment provisions. The following classifications of 
hospitals are paid under special provisions and therefore are not 
generally subject to the cost reimbursement or prospective payment rules 
of this chapter.
    (1) Veterans Administration hospitals.
    (2) Hospitals reimbursed under State cost control systems approved 
under part 403 of this chapter.
    (3) Hospitals reimbursed in accordance with demonstration projects 
authorized under section 402(a) of Public Law 90-248 (42 U.S.C. 1395b-1) 
or section 222(a) of Public Law 92-603 (42 U.S.C. 1395b-1 (note)).
    (4) Nonparticipating hospitals furnishing emergency services to 
Medicare beneficiaries.
    (d) Changes in hospitals' status. For purposes of exclusion from the 
prospective payment systems under this subpart, the status of each 
currently participating hospital (excluded or not excluded) is 
determined at the beginning of each cost reporting period and is 
effective for the entire cost reporting period. Any changes in the 
status of the hospital are made only at the start of a cost reporting 
period.
    (e) Hospitals within hospitals. Except as provided in paragraph (f) 
of this section, for cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 1997, a hospital that occupies space in a building also used 
by another hospital, or in one or more entire buildings located on the 
same campus as buildings used by another hospital, must meet the 
following criteria in order to be excluded from the prospective payment 
system:
    (1) Separate governing body. The hospital has a governing body that 
is separate from the governing body of the hospital occupying space in 
the same building or on the same campus. The hospital's governing body 
is not under the control of the hospital occupying space in the same 
building or on the same campus, or of any third entity that controls 
both hospitals.
    (2) Separate chief medical officer. The hospital has a single chief 
medical officer who reports directly to the governing body and who is 
responsible for all medical staff activities of the hospital. The chief 
medical officer of the hospital is not employed by or under contract 
with either the hospital occupying space in the same building or on the 
same campus or any third entity that controls both hospitals.
    (3) Separate medical staff. The hospital has a medical staff that is 
separate from the medical staff of the hospital occupying space in the 
same building or on the same campus. The hospital's medical staff is 
directly accountable to the governing body for the quality of medical 
care provided in the hospital, and adopts and enforces bylaws governing 
medical staff activities, including criteria and procedures for 
recommending to the governing body the privileges to be granted to 
individual practitioners.
    (4) Chief executive officer. The hospital has a single chief 
executive officer through whom all administrative authority flows, and 
who exercises control and surveillance over all administrative 
activities of the hospital. The chief executive officer is not employed 
by, or under contract with, either the hospital occupying space in the 
same building or on the same campus or any third entity that controls 
both hospitals.
    (5) Performance of basic hospital functions. The hospital meets one 
of the following criteria:
    (i) The hospital performs the basic functions specified in 
Secs. 482.21 through 482.27, 482.30, and 482.42 of this chapter through 
the use of employees or under contracts or other agreements with 
entities other than the hospital occupying space in the same building or 
on the same campus, or a third entity that controls both hospitals. Food 
and dietetic services and housekeeping, maintenance, and other services 
necessary to maintain a clean and safe physical environment could be 
obtained under contracts or other agreements with the hospital occupying 
space in the same building or on the

[[Page 286]]

same campus, or with a third entity that controls both hospitals.
    (ii) For the same period of at least 6 months used to determine 
compliance with the criterion regarding the age of patients in 
Sec. 412.23(d)(2) or the length-of-stay criterion in Sec. 412.23(e)(2), 
or for hospitals other than children's or long-term care hospitals, for 
a period of at least 6 months immediately preceding the first cost 
reporting period for which exclusion is sought, the cost of the services 
that the hospital obtained under contracts or other agreements with the 
hospital occupying space in the same building or on the same campus, or 
with a third entity that controls both hospitals, is no more than 15 
percent of the hospital's total inpatient operating costs, as defined in 
Sec. 412.2(c). For purposes of this paragraph (e)(5)(ii), however, the 
costs of preadmission services are those specified under 
Sec. 413.40(c)(2) rather than those specified under Sec. 412.2(c)(5).
    (iii) For the same period of at least 6 months used to determine 
compliance with the criterion regarding the age of inpatients in 
Sec. 412.23(d)(2) or the length-of-stay criterion in Sec. 412.23(e)(2), 
or for hospitals other than children's or long-term care hospitals, for 
the period of at least 6 months immediately preceding the first cost 
reporting period for which exclusion is sought, the hospital has an 
inpatient population of whom at least 75 percent were referred to the 
hospital from a source other than another hospital occupying space in 
the same building or on the same campus.
    (f) Application for certain hospitals. If a hospital has been 
excluded from the prospective payment systems under this section on or 
before September 30, 1995, the criteria in paragraph (e) of this section 
do not apply to the hospital.
    (g) Definition of control. For purposes of this section, control 
exists if an individual or an organization has the power, directly or

Sec. 412.23  Excluded hospitals: Classifications.

    Hospitals that meet the requirements for the classifications set 
forth in this section may not be reimbursed under the prospective 
payment systems.
    (a) Psychiatric hospitals. A psychiatric hospital must--
    (1) Be primarily engaged in providing, by or under the supervision 
of a psychiatrist, psychiatric services for the diagnosis and treatment 
of mentally ill persons; and
    (2) Meet the conditions of participation for hospitals and special 
conditions of participation for psychiatric hospitals set forth in part 
482 of this chapter.
    (b) Rehabilitation hospitals. A rehabilitation hospital must meet 
the following requirements:
    (1) Have a provider agreement under part 489 of this chapter to 
participate as a hospital.
    (2) Except in the case of a newly participating hospital seeking 
exclusion for its first 12-month cost reporting period, as described in 
paragraph (b)(8) of this section, show that during its most recent 12-
month cost reporting period, it served an inpatient population of whom 
at least 75 percent required intensive rehabilitative services for the 
treatment of one or more of the following conditions:
    (i) Stroke.
    (ii) Spinal cord injury.
    (iii) Congenital deformity.
    (iv) Amputation.
    (v) Major multiple trauma.

each prospective patient's condition and medical history are reviewed to 
determine whether the patient is likely to benefit significantly from an 
intensive inpatient hospital program or assessment.
    (4) Ensure that the patients receive close medical supervision and 
furnish,

[[Page 287]]

through the use of qualified personnel, rehabilitation nursing, physical 
therapy, and occupational therapy, plus, as needed, speech therapy, 
social or psychological services, and orthotic and prosthetic services.
    (5) Have a director of rehabilitation who--
    (i) Provides services to the hospital and its inpatients on a full-
time basis;
    (ii) Is a doctor of medicine or osteopathy;
    (iii) Is licensed under State law to practice medicine or surgery; 
and
    (iv) Has had, after completing a one-year hospital internship, at 
least two years of training or experience in the medical-management of 
inpatients requiring rehabilitation services.
    (6) Have a plan of treatment for each inpatient that is established, 
reviewed, and revised as needed by a physician in consultation with 
other professional personnel who provide services to the patient.
    (7) Use a coordinated multidisciplinary team approach in the 
rehabilitation of each inpatient, as documented by periodic clinical 
entries made in the patient's medical record to note the patient's 
status in relationship to goal attainment, and that team conferences are 
held at least every two weeks to determine the appropriateness of 
treatment.
    (8) A hospital that seeks exclusion as a rehabilitation hospital for 
the first full 12-month cost reporting period that occurs after it 
becomes a Medicare participating hospital may provide a written 
certification that the inpatient population it intends to serve meets 
the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, instead of showing 
that it has treated such a population during its most recent 12-month 
cost reporting period. The written certification is also effective for 
any cost reporting period of not less than one month and not more than 
11 months occurring between the date the hospital began participating in 
Medicare and the start of the hospital's regular 12-month cost reporting 
period.
    (9) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 
1991, if a hospital is excluded from the prospective payment systems for 
a cost reporting period under paragraph (b)(8) of this section, but the 
inpatient population it actually treated during that period does not 
meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, HCFA adjusts 
payments to the hospital retroactively in accordance with the provisions 
in Sec. 412.130 of this part.
    (c)  [Reserved]
    (d) Children's hospitals. A children's hospital must--
    (1) Have a provider agreement under part 489 of this chapter to 
participate as a hospital; and
    (2) Be engaged in furnishing services to inpatients who are 
predominantly individuals under the age of 18.
    (e) Long-term care hospitals. A long-term care hospital must meet 
the requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section, and, 
where applicable, the additional requirements Sec. 412.22(e).
    (1) The hospital must have a provider agreement under part 489 of 
this chapter to participate as a hospital and an average inpatient 
length of stay greater than 25 days as calculated under paragraph (e)(3) 
of this section.
    (2) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after August 5, 1997, 
a hospital that was first excluded from the prospective payment system 
under this section in 1986 must have an average inpatient length of stay 
of greater than 20 days, as calculated under paragraph (e)(3) of this 
section, and must demonstrate that at least 80 percent of its annual 
Medicare inpatient discharges in the 12-month cost reporting period 
ending in fiscal year 1997 have a principal diagnosis that reflects a 
finding of neoplastic disease as defined in paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this 
section.
    (3) The average inpatient length of stay is calculated--
    (i) By dividing the number of total inpatient days (less leave or 
pass days) by the number of total discharges for the hospital's most 
recent complete cost reporting period;
    (ii) If a change in the hospital's average length-of-stay is 
indicated, by the same method for the immediately preceding 6-month 
period; or
    (iii) If a hospital has undergone a change of ownership (as 
described in Sec. 489.18 of this chapter) at the start of a cost 
reporting period or at any time

[[Page 288]]

within the preceding 6 months, the hospital may be excluded from the 
prospective payment system as a long-term care hospital for a cost 
reporting period if, for the 6 months immediately preceding the start of 
the period (including time before the change of ownership), the hospital 
has the required average length of stay, continuously operated as a 
hospital, and continuously participated as a hospital in Medicare.
    (f) Cancer hospitals--(1) General rule. Except as provided in 
paragraph (f)(2) of this section, if a hospital meets the following 
criteria, it is classified as a cancer hospital and is excluded from the 
prospective payment systems beginning with its first cost reporting 
period beginning on or after October 1, 1989. A hospital classified 
after December 19, 1989, is excluded beginning with its first cost 
reporting period beginning after the date of its classification.
    (i) It was recognized as a comprehensive cancer center or clinical 
cancer research center by the National Cancer Institute of the National 
Institutes of Health as of April 20, 1983.
    (ii) It is classified on or before December 31, 1990, or, if on 
December 19, 1989, the hospital was located in a State operating a 
demonstration project under section 1814(b) of the Act, the 
classification is made on or before December 31, 1991.
    (iii) It demonstrates that the entire facility is organized 
primarily for treatment of and research on cancer (that is, the facility 
is not a subunit of an acute general hospital or university-based 
medical center).
    (iv) It shows that at least 50 percent of its total discharges have 
a principal diagnosis that reflects a finding of neoplastic disease. 
(The principal diagnosis for this purpose is defined as the condition 
established after study to be chiefly responsible for occasioning the 
admission of the patient to the hospital. For the purposes of meeting 
this definition, only discharges with ICD-9-CM principal diagnosis codes 
of 140 through 239, V58.0, V58.1, V66.1, V66.2, or 990 will be 
considered to reflect neoplastic disease.)
    (2) Alternative. A hospital that applied for and was denied, on or 
before December 31, 1990, classification as a cancer hospital under the 
criteria set forth in paragraph (f)(1) of this section is classified as 
a cancer hospital and is excluded from the prospective payment systems 
beginning with its first cost reporting period beginning on or after 
January 1, 1991, if it meets the criterion set forth in paragraph 
(f)(1)(i) of this section and the hospital is--
    (i) Licensed for fewer than 50 acute care beds as of August 5, 1997;
    (ii) Is located in a State that as of December 19, 1989, was not 
operating a demonstration project under section 1814(b) of the Act; and
    (iii) Demonstrates that, for the 4-year period ending on December 
31, 1996, at least 50 percent of its total discharges have a principal 
diagnosis that reflects a finding of neoplastic disease as defined in 
paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section.
    (g) Hospitals outside the 50 States, the District of Columbia, or 
Puerto Rico. A hospital is excluded from the prospective payment systems 
if it is not located in one of the fifty States, the District of 
Columbia, or Puerto Rico.
    (h) Hospitals reimbursed under special arrangements. A hospital must 
be excluded from prospective payment for inpatient hospital services if 
it is reimbursed under special arrangement as provided in 
Sec. 412.22(c).

Sec. 412.25  Excluded hospital units: Common requirements.

    (a) Basis for exclusion. In order to be excluded from the 
prospective payment system, a psychiatric or rehabilitation unit must 
meet the following requirements.
    (1) Be part of an institution that--
    (i) Has in effect an agreement under part 489 of this chapter to 
participate as a hospital;
    (ii) Is not excluded in its entirety from the prospective payment 
systems; and
    (iii) Has enough beds that are not excluded from the prospective 
payment

[[Page 289]]

systems to permit the provision of adequate cost information, as 
required by Sec. 413.24(c) of this chapter.
    (2) Have written admission criteria that are applied uniformly to 
both Medicare and non-Medicare patients.
    (3) Have admission and discharge records that are separately 
identified from those of the hospital in which it is located and are 
readily available.
    (4) Have policies specifying that necessary clinical information is 
transferred to the unit when a patient of the hospital is transferred to 
the unit.
    (5) Meet applicable State licensure laws.
    (6) Have utilization review standards applicable for the type of 
care offered in the unit.
    (7) Have beds physically separate from (that is, not commingled 
with) the hospital's other beds.
    (8) Be serviced by the same fiscal intermediary as the hospital.
    (9) Be treated as a separate cost center for cost finding and 
apportionment purposes.
    (10) Use an accounting system that properly allocates costs.
    (11) Maintain adequate statistical data to support the basis of 
allocation.
    (12) Report its costs in the hospital's cost report covering the 
same fiscal period and using the same method of apportionment as the 
hospital.
    (13) As of the first day of the first cost reporting period for 
which all other exclusion requirements are met, the unit is fully 
equipped and staffed and is capable of providing hospital inpatient 
psychiatric or rehabilitation care regardless of whether there are any 
inpatients in the unit on that date.
    (b) Changes in the size of excluded units. For purposes of exclusion 
from the prospective payment systems under this section, the number of 
beds and square footage of each excluded unit remains the same 
throughout each cost reporting period, and any change in the number of 
beds or square footage considered to be part of an excluded unit may be 
made only at the start of a cost reporting period.
    (c) Changes in the status of hospital units. For purposes of 
exclusion from the prospective payment systems under this section, the 
status of each hospital unit (excluded or not excluded) is determined at 
the beginning of each cost reporting period and is effective for the 
entire cost reporting period. Any changes in the status of a unit are 
made only at the start of a cost reporting period. If a unit is added to 
a hospital after the start of a cost reporting period, it cannot be 
excluded from the prospective payment systems before the start of the 
hospital's next cost reporting period.
    (d) Number of excluded units. Each hospital may have only one unit 
of each type (psychiatric or rehabilitation) excluded from the 
prospective payment systems.

<R05>
Sec. 412.29  Excluded rehabilitation units: Additional requirements.

    In order to be excluded from the prospective payment systems, a 
rehabilitation unit must meet the following requirements:
    (a) Have met either the requirements for--
    (1) New units under Sec. 412.30(a); or
    (2) Converted units under Sec. 412.30(b).

    (c) Ensure that the patients receive close medical supervision and 
furnish, through the use of qualified personnel, rehabilitation nursing, 
physical therapy, and occupational therapy, plus, as needed, speech 
therapy, social services or psychological services, and orthotic and

reviewed, and revised as needed by a physician in consultation with 
other professional personnel who provide services to the patient.
    (e) Use a coordinated multidisciplinary team approach in the

<R05>
Sec. 412.30  Exclusion of new rehabilitation units and expansion of units already excluded.

    (a) Bed capacity in units. A decrease in bed capacity must remain in 
effect for at least a full 12-month cost reporting period before an 
equal or lesser number of beds can be added to the hospital's licensure 
and certification and considered ``new'' under paragraph (b) of this 
section. Thus, when a hospital seeks to establish a new unit under the 
criteria under paragraph (b) of this section, or to enlarge an existing 
unit under the criteria under paragraph (d) of this section, the 
regional office will review its records on the facility to determine 
whether any beds have been delicensed and decertified during the 12-
month cost reporting period before the period for which the hospital 
seeks to add the beds. To the extent bed capacity was removed from the 
hospital's licensure and certification during that period, that amount 
of bed capacity may not be considered ``new'' under paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (b) New units. (1) A hospital unit is considered a new unit if the 
hospital--
    (i) Has not previously sought exclusion for any rehabilitation unit; 
and
    (ii) Has obtained approval, under State licensure and Medicare 
certification, for an increase in its hospital bed capacity that is 
greater than 50 percent of the number of beds in the unit.
    (2) A hospital that seeks exclusion of a new rehabilitation unit may 
provide a written certification that the inpatient population the 
hospital intends the unit to serve meets the requirements of 
Sec. 412.23(b)(2) instead of showing that the unit has treated such a 
population during the hospital's most recent cost reporting period.
    (3) The written certification described in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section is effective for the first full cost reporting period during 
which the unit is used to provide hospital inpatient care. If the 
hospital has not previously participated in the Medicare program as a 
hospital, the written certification also is effective for any cost 
reporting period of not less than 1 month and not more than 11 months 
occurring between the date the hospital began participating in Medicare 
and the start of the hospital's regular 12-month cost reporting period.
    (4) If a hospital that has not previously participated in the 
Medicare program seeks exclusion of a rehabilitation unit, it may 
designate certain beds as a new rehabilitation unit for the first full 
12-month cost reporting period that occurs after it becomes a Medicare-
participating hospital. The written certification described in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section also is effective for any cost reporting period 
of not less than 1 month and not more than 11 months occurring between 
the date the hospital began participating in Medicare and the start of 
the hospital's regular 12-month cost reporting period.
    (5) A hospital that has undergone a change of ownership or leasing 
as defined in Sec. 489.18 of this chapter is not considered to have 
participated previously in the Medicare program.
    (c) Converted units. A hospital unit is considered a converted unit 
if it does not qualify as a new unit under paragraph (a) of this 
section. A converted unit must have treated, for the hospital's most 
recent 12-month cost reporting period, an inpatient population of which 
at least 75 percent required intensive rehabilitation services for the 
treatment of one or more conditions listed under Sec. 412.23(b)(2).
    (d) Expansion of excluded rehabilitation units.

[[Page 293]]

    (1) New bed capacity. The beds that a hospital seeks to add to its 
excluded rehabilitation unit are considered new beds only if--
    (i) The hospital's State-licensed and Medicare-certified bed 
capacity increases at the start of the cost reporting period for which 
the hospital seeks to increase the size of its excluded rehabilitation 
unit, or at any time after the start of the preceding cost reporting 
period; and
    (ii) The hospital has obtained approval, under State licensure and 
Medicare certification, for an increase in its hospital bed capacity 
that is greater than 50 percent of the number of beds it seeks to add to 
the unit.
    (2) Conversion of existing bed capacity.
    (i) Bed capacity is considered to be existing bed capacity if it 
does not meet the definition of new bed capacity under paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section.
    (ii) A hospital may increase the size of its excluded rehabilitation 
unit through conversion of existing bed capacity only if it shows that, 
for all of the hospital's most recent cost reporting period of at least 
12 months, the beds have been used to treat an inpatient population 
meeting the requirements of Sec. 412.23(b)(2).
    (e) Retroactive adjustments for certain units. For cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991, if a hospital has a new 
rehabilitation unit excluded from the prospective payment systems for a 
cost reporting period under paragraph (a) of this section or expands an 
existing rehabilitation unit under paragraph (c) of this section, but 
the inpatient population actually treated in the new unit or the beds 
added to the existing unit during that cost reporting period does not 
meet the requirements in Sec. 412.23(b)(2), HCFA adjusts payments to the 
hospital retroactively in accordance with the provisions in Sec. 412.130

Subpart C--Conditions for Payment Under the Prospective Payment Systems 
    for Inpatient Operating Costs and Inpatient Capital-Related Costs


<R05>
Sec. 412.40  General requirements.

    (a) A hospital must meet the conditions of this subpart to receive 
payment under the prospective payment systems for inpatient hospital 
services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries.
    (b) If a hospital fails to comply fully with these conditions with 
respect to inpatient hospital services furnished to one or more Medicare 
beneficiaries, HCFA may, as appropriate--
    (1) Withhold Medicare payment (in full or in part) to the hospital 
until the hospital provides adequate assurances of compliance; or
    (2) Terminate the hospital's provider agreement.

[50 FR 12741, Mar. 29, 1985, as amended at 57 FR 39821, Sept. 1, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 412.42  Limitations on charges to beneficiaries.

    (a) Prohibited charges. A hospital may not charge a beneficiary for 
any services for which payment is made by Medicare, even if the 
hospital's costs of furnishing services to that beneficiary are greater 
than the amount the hospital is paid under the prospective payment 
systems.
    (b) Permitted charges--Stay covered. A hospital receiving payment 
under the prospective payment systems for a covered hospital stay (that 
is, a stay that includes at least one covered day) may charge the 
Medicare beneficiary or other person only for the following:
    (1) The applicable deductible and coinsurance amounts under 
Secs. 409.82, 409.83, and 409.87 of this chapter.
    (2) Noncovered items and services, furnished at any time during a 
covered stay, unless they are excluded from coverage only on the basis 
of the following:
    (i) The exclusion of custodial care under Sec. 405.310(g) of this 
chapter (see paragraph (c) of this section for when

[[Page 294]]

charges may be made for custodial care).
    (ii) The exclusion of medically unnecessary items and services under 
Sec. 405.310(k) of this chapter (see paragraphs (c) and (d) of this 
section for when charges may be made for medically unnecessary items and 
services).
    (iii) The exclusion under Sec. 405.310(m) of this chapter of 
nonphysician services furnished to hospital inpatients by other than the 
hospital or a provider or supplier under arrangements made by the 
hospital.
    (iv) The exclusion of items and services furnished when the patient 
is not entitled to Medicare Part A benefits under subpart A of part 406 
of this chapter (see paragraph (e) of this section for when charges may 
be made for items and services furnished when the patient is not 
entitled to benefits).
    (v) The exclusion of items and services furnished after Medicare 
Part A benefits are exhausted under Sec. 409.61 of this chapter (see 
paragraph (e) of this section for when charges may be made for items and 
services furnished after benefits are exhausted).
    (c) Custodial care and medically unnecessary inpatient hospital 
care. A hospital may charge a beneficiary for services excluded from 
coverage on the basis of Sec. 411.15(g) of this chapter (custodial care) 
or Sec. 411.15(k) of this chapter (medically unnecessary services) and 
furnished by the hospital after all of the following conditions have 
been met:
    (1) The hospital (acting directly or through its utilization review 
committee) determines that the beneficiary no longer requires inpatient 
hospital care. (The phrase ``inpatient hospital care'' includes cases 
where a beneficiary needs a SNF level of care, but, under Medicare 
criteria, a SNF-level bed is not available. This also means that a 
hospital may find that a patient awaiting SNF placement no longer 
requires inpatient hospital care because either a SNF-level bed has 
become available or the patient no longer requires SNF-level care.)
    (2) The attending physician agrees with the hospital's determination 
in writing (for example, by issuing a written discharge order). If the 
hospital believes that the beneficiary does not require inpatient 
hospital care but is unable to obtain the agreement of the physician, it 
may request an immediate review of the case by the PRO. Concurrence by 
the PRO in the hospital's determination will serve in lieu of the 
physician's agreement.
    (3) The hospital (acting directly or through its utilization review 
committee) notifies the beneficiary (or person acting on his or her 
behalf) in writing that--
    (i) In the hospital's opinion, and with the attending physician's 
concurrence or that of the PRO, the beneficiary no longer requires 
inpatient hospital care;
    (ii) Customary charges will be made for continued hospital care 
beyond the second day following the date of the notice;
    (iii) The PRO will make a formal determination on the validity of 
the hospital's finding if the beneficiary remains in the hospital after 
he or she is liable for charges;
    (iv) The determination of the PRO made after the beneficiary 
received the purportedly noncovered services will be appealable by the 
hospital, the attending physician, or the beneficiary under the appeals 
procedures that apply to PRO determinations affecting Medicare Part A 
payment; and
    (v) The charges for continued care will be invalid and refunded if 
collected by the hospital, to the extent that a finding is made that the 
beneficiary required continued care beyond the point indicated by the 
hospital.
    (4) If the beneficiary remains in the hospital after the appropriate 
notification, and the hospital, the physician who concurred in the 
hospital determination on which the notice was based, or PRO 
subsequently finds that the beneficiary requires an acute level of 
inpatient hospital care, the hospital may not charge the beneficiary for 
continued care until the hospital once again determines that the 
beneficiary no longer requires inpatient care, secures concurrence, and 
notifies the beneficiary, as required in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and 
(c)(3) of this section.
    (d) Medically unnecessary diagnostic and therapeutic services. A 
hospital may charge a beneficiary for diagnostic procedures and studies, 
and therapeutic procedures and courses of treatment

[[Page 295]]

(for example, experimental procedures) that are excluded from coverage 
under Sec. 405.310(k) of this chapter (medically unnecessary items and 
services), even though the beneficiary requires continued inpatient 
hospital care, if those services are furnished after the beneficiary (or 
the person acting on his or her behalf) has acknowledged in writing that 
the hospital (acting directly or through its utilization review 
committee and with the concurrence of the intermediary) has informed him 
or her as follows:
    (1) In the hospital's opinion, which has been agreed to by the 
intermediary, the services to be furnished are not considered reasonable 
and necessary under Medicare.
    (2) Customary charges will be made if he or she receives the 
services.
    (3) If the beneficiary receives the services, a formal determination 
on the validity of the hospital's finding is made by the intermediary 
and, to the extent that the decision requires the exercise of medical 
judgment, the PRO.
    (4) The determination is appealable by the hospital, the attending 
physician, or the beneficiary under the appeals procedure that applies 
to determinations affecting Medicare Part A payment.
    (5) The charges for the services will be invalid and, to the extent 
collected, will be refunded by the hospital if the services are found to 
be covered by Medicare.
    (e) Services furnished on days when the individual is not entitled 
to Medicare Part A benefits or has exhausted the available benefits. The 
hospital may charge the beneficiary its customary charges for noncovered 
items and services furnished on outlier days (as described in Subpart F 
of this part) for which payment is denied because the beneficiary is not 
entitled to Medicare Part A or his or her Medicare Part A benefits are 
exhausted. (1) If payment is considered for outlier days, the entire 
stay is reviewed and days up to the number of days in excess of the 
outlier threshold may be denied on the basis of nonentitlement to Part A 
or exhaustion of benefits. (2) In applying this rule, the latest days 
will be denied first.
    (f) Differential for private room or other luxury services. The 
hospital may charge the beneficiary the customary charge differential 
for a private room or other luxury service that is more expensive than 
is medically required and is furnished for the personal comfort of the 
beneficiary at his or her request (or the request of the person acting 
on his or her behalf).
    (g) Review. (1) The PRO or intermediary may review any cases in 
which the hospital advises the beneficiary (or the person acting on his 
or her behalf) of the noncoverage of the services in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(3) or (d) of this section.
    (2) The hospital must identify such cases to the PRO or intermediary 
in accordance with HCFA instructions.

<R05>
Sec. 412.44  Medical review requirements: Admissions and quality review.

    Beginning on November 15, 1984, a hospital must have an agreement 
with a PRO to have the PRO review, on an ongoing basis, the following:
    (a) The medical necessity, reasonableness and appropriateness of 
hospital admissions and discharges.
    (b) The medical necessity, reasonableness and appropriateness of 
inpatient hospital care for which additional payment is sought under the 
outlier provisions of Secs. 412.82 and 412.84 of this chapter.
    (c) The validity of the hospital's diagnostic and procedural 
information.
    (d) The completeness, adequacy, and quality of the services 
furnished in the hospital.
    (e) Other medical or other practices with respect to beneficiaries 
or billing for services furnished to beneficiaries.

50 FR 41886, Oct. 16, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 412.46  Medical review requirements: Physician acknowledgement.

    (a) Basis. Because payment under the prospective payment system is 
based in part on each patient's principal and secondary diagnoses and 
major procedures performed, as evidenced by the physician's entries in 
the patient's

[[Page 296]]

medical record, physicians must complete an acknowledgement statement to 
this effect.
    (b) Content of physician acknowledgement statement. When a claim is 
submitted, the hospital must have on file a signed and dated 
acknowledgement from the attending physician that the physician has 
received the following notice:

    Notice to Physicians: Medicare payment to hospitals is based in part 
on each patient's principal and secondary diagnoses and the major 
procedures performed on the patient, as attested to by the patient's 
attending physician by virtue of his or her signature in the medical 
record. Anyone who misrepresents, falsifies, or conceals essential 
information required for payment of Federal funds, may be subject to 
fine, imprisonment, or civil penalty under applicable Federal laws.

    (c) Completion of acknowledgement. The acknowledgement must be 
completed by the physician at the time that the physician is granted 
admitting privileges at the hospital, or before or at the time the 
physician admits his or her first patient. Existing acknowledgements 
signed by physicians already on staff remain in effect as long as the 
physician has admitting privileges at the hospital.

[60 FR 45847, Sept. 1, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 412.48  Denial of payment as a result of admissions and quality review.

    (a) If HCFA determines, on the basis of information supplied by a 
PRO that a hospital has misrepresented admissions, discharges, or 
billing information, or has taken an action that results in the 
unnecessary admission of an individual entitled to benefits under Part 
A, unnecessary multiple admissions of an individual, or other 
inappropriate medical or other practices with respect to beneficiaries 
or billing for services furnished to beneficiaries, HCFA may as 
appropriate--
    (1) Deny payment (in whole or in part) under Part A with respect to 
inpatient hospital services provided with respect to such an unnecessary 
admission or subsequent readmission of an individual; or
    (2) Require the hospital to take other corrective action necessary 
to prevent or correct the inappropriate practice.
    (b) When payment with respect to admission of an individual patient 
is denied by a PRO under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and liability 
is not waived in accordance with Secs. 405.330 through 405.332 of this 
chapter, notice and appeals are provided under procedures established by 
HCFA to implement the provisions of section 1155 of the Act, Right to 
Hearing and Judicial Review.
    (c) A determination under paragraph (a) of this section, if it is 
related to a pattern of inappropriate admissions and billing practices 
that has the effect of circumventing the prospective payment systems, is 
referred to the Department's Office of Inspector General, for handling 
in accordance with Sec. 1001.301 of this title.

Sec. 412.50  Furnishing of inpatient hospital services directly or under arrangements.

    (a) The applicable payments made under the prospective payment 
systems, as described in subparts H and M of this part, are payment in 
full for all inpatient hospital services, as defined in Sec. 409.10 of 
this chapter, other than physicians' services to individual patients 
reimbursable on a reasonable charge basis (in accordance with the 
criteria of Sec. 415.102(a) of this chapter).
    (b) HCFA does not pay any provider or supplier other than the 
hospital for services furnished to a beneficiary who is an inpatient, 
except for physicians' services reimbursable under Sec. 405.550(b) of 
this chapter and services of an anesthetist employed by a physician 
reimbursable under Sec. 415.102(a) of this chapter.
    (c) The hospital must furnish all necessary covered services to the 
beneficiary either directly or under arrangements (as defined in 
Sec. 409.3 of this chapter).

Subpart D--Basic Methodology for Determining Prospective Payment Federal 
                   Rates for Inpatient Operating Costs


<R05>
Sec. 412.60  DRG classification and weighting factors.

    (a) Diagnosis-related groups. HCFA establishs a classification of 
inpatient hospital discharges by Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs).
    (b) DRG weighting factors. HCFA assigns, for each DRG, an 
appropriate weighting factor that reflects the estimated relative cost 
of hospital resources used with respect to discharges classified within 
that group compared to discharges classified within other groups.
    (c) Assignment of discharges to DRGs. HCFA establishs a methodology 
for classifying specific hospital discharges within DRGs which ensures 
that each hospital discharge is appropriately assigned to a single DRG 
based on essential data abstracted from the inpatient bill for that 
discharge.
    (1) The classification of a particular discharge is based, as 
appropriate, on the patient's age, sex, principal diagnosis (that is, 
the diagnosis established after study to be chiefly responsible for 
causing the patient's admission to the hospital), secondary diagnoses, 
procedures performed, and discharge status.
    (2) Each discharge is assigned to only one DRG (related, except as 
provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, to the patient's principal 
diagnosis) regardless of the number of conditions treated or services 
furnished during the patient's stay.
    (3) When the discharge data submitted by a hospital show a surgical 
procedure unrelated to a patient's principal diagnosis, the bill is 
returned to the hospital for validation and reverification. HCFA's DRG 
classification system provides a DRG, and an appropriate weighting 
factor, for the group of cases for which the unrelated diagnosis and 
procedure are confirmed.
    (d) Review of DRG assignment. (1) A hospital has 60 days after the 
date of the notice of the initial assignment of a discharge to a DRG to 
request a review of that assignment. The hospital may submit additional 
information as a part of its request.
    (2) The intermediary reviews the hospital's request and any 
additional information and decides whether a change in the DRG 
assignment is appropriate. If the intermediary decides that a higher-
weighted DRG should be assigned, the case will be reviewed by the 
appropriate PRO as specified in Sec. 466.71(c)(2) of this chapter.
    (3) Following the 60-day period described in paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section, the hospital may not submit additional information with 
respect to the DRG assignment or otherwise revise its claim.
    (e) Revision of DRG classification and weighting factors. Beginning 
with discharges in fiscal year 1988, HCFA adjusts the classifications 
and weighting factors established under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section at least annually to reflect changes in treatment patterns, 
technology, and other factors that may change the relative use of 
hospital resources.

[50 FR 12741, Mar. 29, 1985, as amended at 52 FR 33057, Sept. 1, 1987; 
57 FR 39821, Sept. 1, 1992; 59 FR 45397, Sept. 1, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 412.62  Federal rates for inpatient operating costs for fiscal year 1984.

    (a) General rule. HCFA determines national adjusted DRG prospective 
payment rates for operating costs, for each inpatient hospital discharge 
in fiscal year 1984 involving inpatient hospital services of a hospital 
in the United States subject to the prospective payment system under 
subpart B of this part, and determines regional adjusted DRG prospective 
payment rates for inpatient operating costs for such discharges in each 
region, for which payment may be made under Medicare Part A. Such rates 
are determined for hospitals located in urban or rural areas within the 
United States and within each such region, respectively, as described in 
paragraphs (b) through (k) of this section.
    (b) Determining allowable individual hospital inpatient operating 
costs. HCFA

[[Page 298]]

determines the Medicare allowable operating costs per discharge of 
inpatient hospital services for each hospital in the data base for the 
most recent cost reporting period for which data are available.
    (c) Updating for fiscal year 1984. HCFA updates each amount 
determined under paragraph (b) of this section for fiscal year 1984 by--
    (1) Updating for fiscal year 1983 by the estimated average rate of 
change of hospital costs industry-wide between the cost reporting period 
used under paragraph (b) of this section and fiscal year 1983; and
    (2) Projecting for fiscal year 1984 by the applicable percentage 
increase in the hospital market basket for fiscal year 1984.
    (d) Standardizing amounts. HCFA standardizes the amount updated 
under paragraph (c) of this section for each hospital by--
    (1) Adjusting for area variations in case mix among hospitals;
    (2) Excluding an estimate of indirect medical education costs;
    (3) Adjusting for area variations in hospital wage levels; and
    (4) Adjusting for the effects of a higher cost of living for 
hospitals located in Alaska and Hawaii.
    (e) Computing urban and rural averages. HCFA computes an average of 
the standardized amounts determined under paragraph (d) of this section 
for urban and rural hospitals in the United States and for urban and 
rural hospitals in each region.
    (f) Geographic classifications. (1) For purposes of paragraph (e) of 
this section, the following definitions apply:
    (i) The term region means one of the nine census divisions, 
comprising the fifty States and the District of Columbia, established by 
the Bureau of the Census for statistical and reporting purposes.
    (ii) The term urban area means--
    (A) A Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or New England County 
Metropolitan Area (NECMA), as defined by the Executive Office of 
Management and Budget; or
    (B) The following New England counties, which are deemed to be parts 
of urban areas under section 601(g) of the Social Security Amendments of 
1983 (Pub. L. 98-21, 42 U.S.C. 1395ww (note)): Litchfield County, 
Connecticut; York County, Maine; Sagadahoc County, Maine; Merrimack 
County, New Hampshire; and Newport County, Rhode Island.
    (iii) The term rural area means any area outside an urban area.
    (iv) The phrase hospital reclassified as rural means a hospital 
located in a county that was part of an MSA or NECMA, as defined by the 
Executive Office of Management and Budget, but is not part of an MSA or 
NECMA as a result of an Executive Office of Management and Budget 
redesignation occurring after April 20, 1983.
    (2) For hospitals within an MSA or NECMA that crosses census 
division boundaries, the following provisions apply:
    (i) The MSA or NECMA is deemed to belong to the census division in 
which most of the hospitals within the MSA or NECMA are located.
    (ii) If a hospital would receive a lower Federal rate because most 
of the hospitals are located in a census division with a lower Federal 
rate than the rate applicable to the census division in which the 
hospital is located, the payment rate will not be reduced for the 
hospital's cost reporting period beginning before October 1, 1984.
    (iii) If an equal number of hospitals within the MSA or NECMA are 
located in each census division, such hospitals are deemed to be in the 
census division with the higher Federal rate.
    (g) Adjusting the average standardized amounts. HCFA adjusts each of 
the average standardized amounts determined under paragraphs (c), (d), 
and (e) of this section by factors representing HCFA's estimates of the 
following:
    (1) The amount of payment that would have been made under Medicare 
Part B for nonphysician services to hospital inpatients during the first 
cost reporting period subject to prospective payment were it not for the 
fact that such services must be furnished either directly by hospitals 
or under arrangements in order for any Medicare payment to be made after 
September 30, 1983 (the effective date of Sec. 405.310(m) of this 
chapter).
    (2) The amount of FICA taxes that would be incurred during the first 
cost

[[Page 299]]

reporting period subject to the prospective payment system, by hospitals 
that had not incurred such taxes for any or all of their employees 
during the base period described in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (h) Reducing for value of outlier payments. HCFA reduces each of the 
adjusted average standardized amounts determined under paragraphs (c) 
through (g) of this section by a proportion equal to the proportion 
(estimated by HCFA) of the total amount of payments based on DRG 
prospective payment rates that are additional payments for outlier cases 
under subpart F of this part.
    (i) Maintaining budget neutrality. (1) HCFA adjusts each of the 
reduced standardized amounts determined under paragraphs (c) through (h) 
of this section as required for fiscal year 1984 so that the estimated 
amount of aggregate payments made, excluding the hospital-specific 
portion (that is, the total of the Federal portion of transition 
payments, plus any adjustments and special treatment of certain classes 
of hospitals for Federal fiscal year 1984) is not greater or less than 
25 percent of the payment amounts that would have been payable for the 
inpatient operating costs for those same hospitals for fiscal year 1984 
under the Social Security Act as in effect on April 19, 1983.
    (2) The aggregate payments considered under this paragraph exclude 
payments for per case review by a utilization and quality control peer 
review organization, as allowed under section 1866(a)(1)(F) of the Act.
    (j) Computing Federal rates for inpatient operating costs for urban 
and rural hospitals in the United States and in each region. For each 
discharge classified within a DRG, HCFA establishes a national 
prospective payment rate for inpatient operating costs and a regional 
prospective payment rate for inpatient operating costs for each region, 
as follows:
    (1) For hospitals located in an urban area in the United States or 
in that region respectively, the rate equals the product of--
    (i) The adjusted average standardized amount (computed under 
paragraphs (c) through (i) of this section) for hospitals located in an 
urban area in the United States or in that region; and
    (ii) The weighting factor determined under Sec. 412.60(b) for that 
DRG.
    (2) For hospitals located in a rural area in the United States or in 
that region respectively, the rate equals the product of--
    (i) The adjusted average standardized amount (computed under 
paragraphs (c) through (i) of this section) for hospitals located in a 
rural area in the United States or that region; and
    (ii) The weighting factor determined under Sec. 412.60(b) for that 
DRG.
    (k) Adjusting for different area wage levels. HCFA adjusts the 
proportion (as estimated by HCFA from time to time) of Federal rates 
computed under paragraph (j) of this section that are attributable to 
wages and labor-related costs, for area differences in hospital wage 
levels by a factor (established by HCFA) reflecting the relative 
hospital wage level in the geographic area (that is, urban or rural area 
as determined under the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section) of 
the hospital compared to the national average hospital wage level.

Sec. 412.63  Federal rates for inpatient operating costs for fiscal years after Federal fiscal year 1984.

    (a) General rule. (1) HCFA determines a national adjusted 
prospective payment rate for inpatient operating costs for each 
inpatient hospital discharge in a Federal fiscal year after fiscal year 
1984 involving inpatient hospital services of a hospital in the United 
States subject to the prospective payment system, and determines a 
regional adjusted prospective payment rate for operating costs for such 
discharges in each region, for which payment may be made under Medicare 
Part A.
    (2) Each such rate is determined for hospitals located in urban or 
rural areas within the United States and within each such region 
respectively, as described in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this 
section.

[[Page 300]]

    (b) Geographic classifications. (1) For purposes of this section, 
the definitions set forth in Sec. 412.62(f) apply.
    (2) For hospitals within an MSA or NECMA that crosses census 
division boundaries, the following provisions apply:
    (i) The MSA or NECMA is deemed to belong to the census division in 
which most of the hospitals within the MSA or NECMA are located.
    (ii) A hospital that met the conditions specified in 
Sec. 412.62(f)(2)(ii) and therefore did not receive a lower Federal rate 
that would have applied for cost reporting periods beginning before 
October 1, 1984, receives the lower Federal rate applicable to all 
hospitals in the MSA or NECMA in which it is located effective with the 
hospital's cost reporting period that begins on or after October 1, 
1984.
    (iii) The higher Federal rate is payable to all hospitals in the MSA 
or NECMA if an equal number of hospitals within the MSA or NECMA are 
located in each census division.
    (3) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1988, a hospital 
located in a rural county adjacent to one or more urban areas is deemed 
to be located in an urban area and receives the Federal payment amount 
for the urban area to which the greater number of workers in the county 
commute if the rural county would otherwise be considered part of an 
urban area, under the standards for designating MSAs or NECMAs if the 
commuting rates used in determining outlying counties were determined on 
the basis of the aggregate number of resident workers who commute to 
(and, if applicable under the standards, from) the central county or 
central counties of all adjacent MSAs or NECMAs. These EOMB standards 
are set forth in the notice of final standards for classification of 
MSAs published in the Federal Register on January 3, 1980 (45 FR 956), 
and available from HCFA, East High Rise Building, room 132, 6325 
Security Boulevard, Baltimore, Maryland 21207.
    (4) For purposes of this section, any change in an MSA or NECMA 
designation is recognized on the October 1 following the effective date 
of the change.
    (5) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1988, for 
hospitals that consist of two or more separately located inpatient 
hospital facilities the national adjusted prospective payment rate is 
based on the geographic location of the hospital facility at which the 
discharge occurs.
    (c) Updating previous standardized amounts. (1) HCFA computes an 
average standardized amount for hospitals in urban areas and rural areas 
within the United States, and urban areas and rural areas within each 
region.
    (2) Each of those amounts is equal to the respective adjusted 
average standardized amount computed for fiscal year 1984 under 
Sec. 412.62(g)--
    (i) Increased for fiscal year 1985 by the applicable percentage 
increase in the hospital market basket;
    (ii) Adjusted by the estimated amount of Medicare payment for 
nonphysician services furnished to hospital inpatients that would have 
been paid under Part B were it not for the fact that such services must 
be furnished either directly by hospitals or under arrangements;
    (iii) Reduced by a proportion equal to the proportion (estimated by 
HCFA) of the total amount of prospective payments that are additional 
payment amounts attributable to outlier cases under subpart F of this 
part; and
    (iv) Adjusted for budget neutrality under paragraph (h) of this 
section.
    (3) For fiscal year 1986 and thereafter. HCFA computes, for urban 
and rural hospitals in the United States and for urban and rural 
hospitals in each region, average standardized amount equal to the 
respective adjusted average standardized amounts computed for the 
previous fiscal year--
    (i) Increased by the applicable percentage increase determined under 
paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section;
    (ii) Adjusted by the estimated amount of Medicare payment for 
nonphysician services furnished to hospital inpatients that would have 
been paid under Part B were it not for the fact that such services must 
be furnished either directly by hospitals or under arrangements; and
    (iii) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1985 and 
before October

[[Page 301]]

1, 1986, reduced by a proportion (estimated by HCFA) of the amount of 
payments based on the total amount of prospective payments that are 
additional payment amounts attributable to outlier cases under subpart F 
of this part, and for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1986, 
reduced by a proportion (estimated by HCFA) of the amount of payments 
that, based on the total amount of prospective payments for urban 
hospitals and the total amount of prospective payments for rural 
hospitals, are additional payments attributable to outlier cases in such 
hospitals under subpart F of this part.
    (4) For fiscal years 1987 through 1990 HCFA standardizes the average 
standardized amounts by excluding an estimate of the payments for 
hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients.
    (5) For fiscal year 1987 onward, HCFA restandardizes the average 
standardized amounts by excluding an estimate of indirect medical 
education payments.
    (6) For fiscal year 1988 and thereafter, HCFA computes average 
standardized amounts for hospitals located in large urban areas, other 
urban areas, and rural areas. The term large urban area means an MSA 
with a population of more than 1,000,000 or an NECMA, with a population 
of more than 970,000 based on the most recent available population data 
published by the Bureau of the Census.
    (d) Applicable percentage change for fiscal year 1986. (1) The 
applicable percentage change for fiscal year 1986 is--
    (i) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1985 and before 
May 1. 1986, zero percent; and
    (ii) For discharges occurring on or after May 1, 1986, one-half of 
one percent.
    (2) For purposes of determining the standardized amounts for 
discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1986, the applicable 
percentage increase for fiscal year 1986 is deemed to have been one-half 
of one percent.

November 21, 1987, zero percent;
    (ii) For discharges occurring on or after November 21, 1987 and 
before April 1, 1988, 2.7 percent; and
    (iii) For discharges occurring on or after April 1, 1988 and before 
October 1, 1988--
    (A) 3.0 percent for hospitals located in rural areas;
    (B) 1.5 percent for hospitals located in large urban areas; and
    (C) 1.0 percent for hospitals located in other urban areas.
    (2) For purposes of determining the standardized amounts for 
discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1988 (for Federal fiscal 
year 1989), the applicable percentage change for fiscal year 1988 is 
deemed to have been--
    (i) 3.0 percent for hospitals located in rural areas;

    (ii) For discharges occurring on or after January 1, 1990 and before 
October 1, 1990--
    (A) 9.72 percent for hospitals located in rural areas;
    (B) 5.62 percent for hospitals located in large urban areas; and
    (C) 4.97 percent for hospitals located in other urban areas.
    (2) For purposes of determining the standardized amounts for 
discharges

[[Page 302]]

    (u) Maintaining budget neutrality for fiscal year 1985. (1) For 
fiscal year 1985, HCFA will adjust each of the reduced standardized 
amounts determined under paragraph (c) of this section as required for 
fiscal year 1985 to ensure that the estimated amount of aggregate 
payments made, excluding the hospital-specific portion (that is, the 
total of the Federal portion of transition payments, plus any 
adjustments and special treatment of certain classes of hospitals for 
fiscal year 1985) is not greater or less than 50 percent of the payment 
amounts that would have been payable for the inpatient operating costs 
for those same hospitals for fiscal year 1985 under the law as in effect 
on April 19, 1983.
    (2) The aggregate payments considered under this paragraph exclude 
payments for per case review by a utilization and quality control peer 
review organization, as allowed under section 1866(a)(1)(F) of the Act.
    (v) Computing Federal rates for inpatient operating costs for 
hospitals located in large urban and other areas. For each discharge 
classified within a DRG, HCFA establishes for the fiscal year a national 
prospective payment rate and a regional prospective payment rate for 
inpatient operating costs, for each region, as follows:
    (1) For hospitals located in a large urban area in the United States 
or that region respectively, the rate equals the product of--
    (i) The adjusted average standardized amount (computed under 
paragraph (c) of this section) for the fiscal year for hospitals located 
in a large urban area in the United States or in that region; and
    (ii) The weighting factor determined under Sec. 412.60(b) for that 
DRG.
    (2) For hospitals located in an other area in the United States or 
that region respectively, the rate equals the product of--
    (i) The adjusted average standardized amount (computed under 
paragraph (c) of this section) for the fiscal year for hospitals located 
in an other area in the United States or that region; and
    (ii) The weighting factor (determined under Sec. 412.60(b)) for that 
DRG.
    (w) Adjusting for different area wage levels. (1) HCFA adjusts the 
proportion (as estimated by HCFA from time to time) of Federal rates for 
inpatient operating costs computed under paragraph (j) of this section 
that are attributable to wages and labor-related costs for area 
differences in hospital wage levels by a factor (established by HCFA 
based on survey data) reflecting the relative level of hospital wages 
and wage-related costs in the geographic area (that is, urban or rural 
area as determined under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this 
section) of the hospital compared to the national average level of 
hospital wages and wage-related costs. The wage index is updated 
annually.
    (2)(i) HCFA makes a midyear correction to the wage index for an area 
only if a hospital can show that--
    (A) The intermediary or HCFA made an error in tabulating the 
hospital's data; and
    (B) The hospital could not have known about the error, or did not 
have the opportunity to correct the error, before the beginning of the 
Federal fiscal year.
    (ii) A midyear correction to the wage index is effective 
prospectively from the date the change is made to the wage index.
    (3) Revisions to the wage index resulting from midyear corrections 
to the wage index values are incorporated in the wage index values for 
other areas at the beginning of the next Federal fiscal year.
    (4) The effect on program payments of midyear corrections to the 
wage

[[Page 304]]

index values is taken into account in establishing the standardized 
amounts for the following Federal fiscal year.
    (5) If a judicial decision reverses a HCFA denial of a hospital's 
wage data revision request, HCFA pays the hospital by applying a revised 
wage index that reflects the revised wage data as if HCFA's decision had 
been favorable rather than unfavorable.

  Subpart E--Determination of Transition Period Payment Rates for the 
        Prospective Payment System for Inpatient Operating Costs


<R05>
412.70  General description.

    For discharges occurring on or after April 1, 1988, and before 
October 1, 1996, payments to a hospital are based on the greater of the 
national average standardized amount or the sum of 85 percent of the 
national average standardized amount and 15 percent of the average 
standardized amount for the region in which the hospital is located.

[57 FR 39822, Sept. 1, 1992, as amended at 58 FR 46338, Sept. 1, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 412.71  Determination of base-year inpatient operating costs.

    (a) Base-year costs. (1) For each hospital, the intermediary will 
estimate the hospital's Medicare Part A allowable inpatient operating 
costs, as described in Sec. 412.2(c), for the 12-month or longer cost 
reporting period ending on or after September 30, 1982 and before 
September 30, 1983.
    (2) If the hospital's last cost reporting period ending before 
September 30, 1983 is for less than 12 months, the base period will be 
the hospital's most recent 12-month or longer cost reporting period 
ending before such short reporting period, with an appropriate 
adjustment for inflation. (The rules applicable to new hospitals are set 
forth in Sec. 412.74.)
    (b) Modifications to base-year costs. Prior to determining the 
hospital-specific rate, the intermediary will adjust the hospital's 
estimated base-year inpatient operating costs, as necessary, to include 
malpractice insurance costs in accordance with Sec. 413.53(a)(1)(i) of 
this chapter, and exclude the following:
    (1) Medical education costs as described in Sec. 413.85 of this 
chapter.
    (2) Capital-related costs as described in Sec. 413.130 of this 
chapter.
    (3) Kidney acquisition costs incurred by hospitals approved as renal 
transplantation centers as described in Sec. 412.100. Kidney acquisition 
costs in the base year will be determined by multiplying the hospital's 
average kidney acquisition cost per kidney times the number of kidney 
transplants covered by Medicare Part A during the base period.
    (4) Higher costs that were incurred for purposes of increasing base-
year costs.
    (5) One-time nonrecurring higher costs or revenue offsets that have 
the effect of distorting base-year costs as an appropriate basis for 
computing the hospital-specific rate.
    (6) Higher costs that result from changes in hospital accounting 
principles initiated in the base year.
    (7) The costs of qualified nonphysician anesthetists' services, as 
described in Sec. 412.113(c).
    (c) Hospital's request for adjustment of base-year inpatient 
operating costs. (1) Before the date it becomes subject to the 
prospective payment system for inpatient operating costs, a hospital may 
request the intermediary to further adjust its estimated base-period 
costs to take into account the following:
    (i) Services paid for under Medicare Part B during the hospital's 
base year that will be paid for under prospective payments. The base-
year costs may be increased to include estimated payments for certain 
services previously billed as physicians' services before the effective 
date of Sec. 415.102(a) of this chapter, and estimated payments for 
nonphysicians' services that were not furnished either directly or under 
arrangements before October 1, 1983 (the effective date of 
Sec. 405.310(m) of this chapter), but may not include the costs of 
anesthetists' services for which a physician employer continues to bill 
under Sec. 405.553(b)(4) of this chapter.

[[Page 305]]

    (ii) The payment of FICA taxes during cost reporting periods subject 
to the prospective payment system, if the hospital had not paid such 
taxes for all its employees during its base period and will be required 
to participate effective January 1, 1984.
    (2) If a hospital requests that its base-period costs be adjusted 
under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, it must timely provide the 
intermediary with sufficient documentation to justify the adjustment, 
and adequate data to compute the adjusted costs. The intermediary 
decides whether to use part or all of the data on the basis of audit, 
survey and other information available.
    (d) Intermediary's determination. The intermediary uses the best 
data available at the time in estimating each hospital's base-year costs 
and the modifications to those costs authorized by paragraphs (b) and 
(c) of this section. The intermediary's estimate of base-year costs and 
modifications thereto is final and may not be changed after the first 
day of the first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 
1983, except as provided in Sec. 412.72.

[50 FR 12741, Mar. 29, 1985, as amended at 51 FR 34793, Sept. 30, 1986; 
52 FR 33057, Sept. 1, 1987; 57 FR 33897, July 31, 1992; 57 FR 39822, 
Sept. 1, 1992; 59 FR 45398, Sept. 1, 1994; 60 FR 63188, Dec. 8, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 412.72  Modification of base-year costs.

    (a) Bases for modification of base-year costs. Base-year costs as 
determined under Sec. 412.71(d) may be modified under the following 
circumstances:
    (1) Inadvertent omissions. (i) A hospital that becomes subject to 
the prospective payment system beginning on or after October 1, 1983 and 
before November 16, 1983 has until November 15, 1983 to request its 
intermediary to reestimate its base-period costs to take into account 
inadvertent omissions in its previous submissions to the intermediary 
related to changes made by the prospective payment legislation for 
purposes of estimating the base-period costs.
    (ii) The intermediary may also initiate changes to the estimation--
    (A) For any reason before the date the hospital becomes subject to 
prospective payment; and
    (B) Before November 16, 1983, for corrections to take into account 
inadvertent omissions in the hospital's previous submissions related to 
changes made by the prospective payment legislation for purposes of 
estimating the base-period costs.
    (iii) Such omissions pertain to adjustments to exclude capital-
related costs and the direct medical education costs of approved 
educational activities and to adjustments specified in Sec. 412.71(c).
    (iv) The intermediary must notify the provider of any change to the 
hospital-specific amount as a result of the provider's request within 30 
days of receipt of the additional data.
    (v) Any change to base-period costs made under this paragraph (a)(1) 
will be made effective retroactively, beginning with the first day of 
the affected hospital's fiscal year.
    (2) Correction of mathematical errors of calculations. (i) The 
hospital must report mathematical errors of calculations to the 
intermediary within 90 days of the intermediary's notification to the 
hospital of the hospital's payments rates.
    (ii) The intermediary may also identify such errors and initiate 
their correction during this period.
    (iii) The intermediary will either make an appropriate adjustment or 
notify the hospital that no adjustment is warranted within 30 days of 
receipt of the hospital's report of an error.
    (iv) Corrections of errors of calculation will be effective with the 
first day of the hospital's first cost reporting period subject to the 
prospective payment system.
    (3) Recognition of additional costs. (i) The intermediary may adjust 
base-period costs to take into account additional costs recognized as 
allowable costs for the hospital's base year as the result of any of the 
following:
    (A) A reopening and revision of the hospital's base-year notice of 
amount of program reimbursement under Secs. 405.1885 through 405.1889 of 
this chapter.

[[Page 306]]

    (B) A prehearing order or finding issued during the provider payment 
appeals process by the appropriate reviewing authority under 
Sec. 405.1821 or Sec. 405.1853 of this chapter that resolved a matter at 
issue in the hospital's base-year notice of amount of program 
reimbursement.
    (C) An affirmation, modification, or reversal of a Provider 
Reimbursement Review Board decision by the Administrator of HCFA under 
Sec. 405.1875 of this chapter that resolved a matter at issue in the 
hospital's base-year notice of amount of program reimbursement.
    (D) An administrative or judicial review decision under 
Secs. 405.1831, 405.1871, or 405.1877 of this chapter that is final and 
no longer subject to review under applicable law or regulations by a 
higher reviewing authority, and that resolved a matter at issue in the 
hospital's base-year notice of amount of program reimbursement.
    (ii) The intermediary will recalculate the hospital's base-year 
costs, incorporating the additional costs recognized as allowable for 
the hospital's base year. Adjustments to base-year costs to take into 
account these additional costs--
    (A) Will be effective with the first day of the hospital's first 
cost reporting period beginning on or after the date of the revision, 
order or finding, or review decision; and
    (B) Will not be used to recalculate the hospital-specific portion as 
determined for fiscal years beginning before the date of the revision, 
order or finding, or review decision.
    (4) Successful appeal. The intermediary may modify base-year costs 
to take into account a successful appeal relating to modifications to 
base-year costs that were made under Sec. 412.71(b). If a hospital 
successfully contests a modification to base-year costs--
    (i) The intermediary will recalculate the hospital's base-year costs 
to reflect the modification determined appropriate as a result of the 
appeal; and
    (ii) Such adjustments will be effective retroactively to the time of 
the intermediary's initial estimation of base-year costs.
    (5) Unlawfully claimed costs. The intermediary may modify base-year 
costs to exclude costs that were unlawfully claimed as determined as a 
result of criminal conviction, imposition of a civil judgment under the 
False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729-3731), or a proceeding for exclusion 
from the Medicare program. In addition to adjusting base-year costs, 
HCFA will recover both the excess costs reimbursed for the base period 
and the additional amounts paid due to the inappropriate increase of the 
hospital-specific portion of the hospital's transition payment rates. 
The amount to be recovered will be computed on the basis of the final 
resolution of the amount of the inappropriate base-year costs.
    (b) Right to administrative and judicial review. (1) An 
intermediary's estimation of a hospital's base-year costs, and 
modifications, made for purposes of determining the hospital-specific 
rate, are subject to administrative and judicial review. Review will be 
available to a hospital upon receipt of its notice of amount of program 
reimbursement following the close of its cost reporting period, but only 
with respect to whether the intermediary followed the provisions of 
Secs. 412.71 and 412.72. (Sections 405.1803 and 405.1807 of this chapter 
set forth the rules for intermediary determinations and notice of amount 
of program reimbursement and the effect of those determinations.)
    (2) In any administrative or judicial review of whether the 
intermediary used the best data available at the time, as required by 
Sec. 412.71(d), an intermediary's estimation will be revised on the 
basis of this review only if the estimation was unreasonable and clearly 
erroneous in light of the data available at the time the estimation was 
made.
    (3) Specifically excluded from administrative or judicial review are 
any issues based on data, information, or arguments not presented to the 
intermediary at the time of the estimation.


<R05>
Sec. 412.73  Determination of the hospital-specific rate based on a Federal fiscal year 1982 base period.

    (a) Costs on a per discharge basis. The intermediary will determine 
the hospital's estimated adjusted base-year

[[Page 307]]

operating cost per discharge by dividing the total adjusted operating 
costs by the number of discharges in the base period.
    (b) Case-mix adjustment. The intermediary will divide the adjusted 
base-year costs by the hospital's 1981 case-mix index. If the hospital's 
case-mix index is statistically unreliable (as determined by HCFA), the 
hospital's base-year costs will be divided by the lower of the 
following:
    (1) The hospital's estimated case-mix index.
    (2) The average case-mix index for the appropriate classifications 
of all hospitals subject to cost limits established under Sec. 413.30 of 
this chapter for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 
1982 and before October 1, 1983.
    (c) Updating base-year costs--(1) For Federal fiscal year 1984. The 
case-mix adjusted base-year cost per discharge will be updated by the 
applicable updating factor, that is, the rate-of-increase percentage 
determined under Sec. 413.40(c)(3) of this chapter, as adjusted for 
budget neutrality.
    (2) For Federal fiscal year 1985. The amount determined under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be updated by the applicable 
updating factor, as adjusted for budget neutrality.
    (3) For Federal fiscal year 1986. (i) The amount determined under 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section is updated by--
    (A) Zero percent for the first seven months of the hospital's cost 
reporting period; and
    (B) One-half of one percent for the remaining five months of the 
hospital's cost reporting period.
    (ii) For purposes of determining the updated base-year costs for 
cost reporting periods beginning in Federal fiscal year 1987 (that is, 
on or after October 1, 1986 and before October 1, 1987), the update 
factor for the previous cost reporting period is deemed to have been 
one-half of one percent.
    (4) For Federal fiscal year 1987. The amount determined under 
paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section is updated by 1.15 percent.
    (5) For Federal fiscal year 1988. (i) For purposes of determining 
the prospective payment rates for sole community hospitals under 
Sec. 412.92(d) for cost reporting periods beginning in Federal fiscal 
year 1988 (that is, on or after October 1, 1987 and before October 1, 
1988), the base-year cost per discharge is updated as follows:
    (A) For the first 51 days of the hospital's cost reporting period, 
by zero percent.
    (B) For the next 132 days of the hospital's cost reporting period, 
by 2.7 percent.
    (C) For the remainder of the hospital's cost reporting period, by--
    (1) 3.0 percent for hospitals located in rural areas;
    (2) 1.5 percent for hospitals located in large urban areas; and
    (3) 1.0 percent for hospitals located in other urban areas.
    (ii) For purposes of determining the updated base-year costs for 
cost reporting periods beginning in Federal fiscal year 1989 (that is, 
beginning on or after October 1, 1988 and before October 1, 1989), the 
update factor for the cost reporting period beginning during federal 
Fiscal year 1988 is deemed to have been--
    (A) 3.0 percent for hospitals located in rural areas;
    (B) 1.5 percent for hospitals located in large urban areas; and
    (C) 1.0 percent for hospitals located in other urban areas.
    (6) For Federal fiscal year 1989. For cost reporting periods 
beginning in Federal fiscal year 1989, the update factor is determined 
using the methodology set forth in Sec. 412.63(g).
    (7) For Federal fiscal year 1990. (i) Except as described in 
paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section, for cost reporting periods 
beginning in Federal fiscal year 1990, the base-period cost per 
discharge is updated as follows:
    (A) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1989 
and before January 1, 1990, by 5.5 percent for discharges occurring 
before January 1, 1990 and by the factors set forth in paragraph 
(c)(7)(i)(B) of this section for discharges occurring on or after 
January 1, 1990.
    (B) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 1990 
and before October 1, 1990, by--
    (1) 9.72 percent for hospitals located in rural areas;

[[Page 308]]

    (2) 5.62 percent for hospitals located in large urban areas; and
    (3) 4.97 percent for hospitals located in other urban areas.
    (ii) For discharges occurring on or after October 21, 1990 and 
before January 1, 1991, the base-period cost per discharge, updated as 
set forth in paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section, is reduced by 5.5 
percent.
    (iii) For purposes of determining the updated base-period costs for 
cost reporting periods beginning in Federal fiscal year 1991 (that is, 
beginning on or after October 1, 1990 and before October 1, 1991), the 
update factor for the cost reporting period beginning during Federal 
fiscal year 1990 is deemed to have been the percentage change provided 
for in paragraph (c)(7)(i)(B) of this section.
    (8) For Federal fiscal year 1991. (i) Except as described in 
paragraph (c)(8)(ii) of this section, for cost reporting periods 
beginning in Federal fiscal year 1991, the base-period cost per 
discharge is updated by 5.2 percent.
    (ii) For discharges occurring on or after October 21, 1990 and 
before January 1, 1991, the base-period cost per discharge is updated by 
0.0 percent.
    (iii) For purposes of determining the updated base period costs for 
cost reporting periods beginning in Federal fiscal year 1992, the update 
factor for the cost reporting period beginning during Federal fiscal 
year 1991 is deemed to have been the percentage change provided for in 
paragraph (c)(8)(i) of this section.
    (9) For Federal fiscal years 1992 and 1993. For Federal fiscal years 
1992 and 1993, the update factor is the percentage increase in the 
market basket index for prospective payment hospitals (as defined in 
Sec. 413.40(a) of this chapter).
    (10) For Federal fiscal year 1994. For Federal fiscal year 1994, the 
update factor is the percentage increase in the market basket index for 
prospective payment hospitals (as defined in Sec. 413.40(a) of the 
chapter) minus 2.3 percentage points. For purposes of determining the 
hospital-specific rate for Federal fiscal year 1994 and subsequent 
years, this update factor is adjusted to take into account the portion 
of the 12-month cost reporting period beginning during Federal fiscal 
year 1993 that occurs in Federal fiscal year 1994.
    (11) For Federal fiscal year 1995. For Federal fiscal year 1995, the 
update factor is the percentage increase in the market basket index for 
prospective payment hospitals (as defined in Sec. 413.40(a) of this 
chapter) minus 2.2 percentage points.
    (12) For Federal fiscal years 1996 and following. For Federal fiscal 
years 1996 and following, the update factor is the market basket index 
for prospective payment hospitals (as defined in Sec. 413.40(a) of this 
chapter).
    (d) Budget neutrality--(1) Federal fiscal year 1984. For cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1983 and before 
October 1, 1984, HCFA adjusts the target rate percentage used under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section. This adjustment is based on a factor 
actuarially estimated to ensure that the estimated amount of aggregate 
Medicare payments based on the hospital-specific portion of the 
transition payment rates is neither greater nor less than 75 percent of 
the amounts that would have been payable for the inpatient operating 
costs for those same hospitals for fiscal year 1984 under the law in 
effect before April 20, 1983.
    (2) Federal fiscal year 1985. For cost reporting periods beginning 
on or after October 1, 1984 and before October 1, 1985, HCFA adjusts the 
target rate percentage used under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. This 
adjustment is based on a factor actuarially estimated to ensure that the 
estimated amount of aggregate Medicare payment based on the hospital-
specific portion of the transition payment rates is neither greater nor 
less than 50 percent of the amounts that would have been payable for the 
inpatient operating costs for those same hospitals for fiscal year 1985 
under the Social Security Act as in effect on April 19, 1983.
    (e) DRG adjustment. The applicable hospital-specific cost per 
discharge is multiplied by the appropriate DRG weighting factor to 
determine the hospital-specific base payment amount

[[Page 309]]

(target amount) for a particular covered discharge.

<R05>
Sec. 412.75  Determination of the hospital-specific rate for inpatient operating costs based on a Federal fiscal year 1987 base period.

    (a) Base-period costs--(1) General rule. Except as provided in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, for each hospital, the intermediary 
determines the hospital's Medicare part A allowable inpatient operating 
costs, as described in Sec. 412.2(c), for the 12-month or longer cost 
reporting period ending on or after September 30, 1987 and before 
September 30, 1988.
    (2) Exceptions. (i) If the hospital's last cost reporting period 
ending before September 30, 1988 is for less than 12 months, the base 
period is the hospital's most recent 12-month or longer cost reporting 
period ending before the short period report.
    (ii) If the hospital does not have a cost reporting period ending on 
or after September 30, 1987 and before September 30, 1988 and does have 
a cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1986 and before 
October 1, 1987, that cost reporting period is the base period unless 
the cost reporting period is for less than 12 months. In that case, the 
base period is the hospital's most recent 12-month or longer cost 
reporting period ending before the short cost reporting period.
    (b) Costs on a per discharge basis. The intermediary determines the 
hospital's average base-period operating cost per discharge by dividing 
the total operating costs by the number of discharges in the base 
period. For purposes of this section, a transfer as defined in 
Sec. 412.4(b) is considered to be a discharge.
    (c) Case-mix adjustment. The intermediary divides the average base-
period cost per discharge by the hospital's case-mix index for the base 
period.
    (d) Updating base-period costs. For purposes of determining the 
updated base-period costs for cost reporting periods beginning in 
Federal fiscal year 1988, the update factor is determined using the 
methodology set forth in Sec. 412.73 (c)(5) through (c)(12).
    (e) DRG adjustment. The applicable hospital-specific cost per 
discharge is multiplied by the appropriate DRG weighting factor to 
determine the hospital-specific base payment amount (target amount) for 
a particular covered discharge.
    (f) Notice of hospital-specific rate. The intermediary furnishes the 
hospital a notice of its hospital-specific rate, which contains a 
statment of the hospital's Medicare part A allowable inpatient operating 
costs, number of Medicare discharges, and case-mix index adjustment 
factor used to determine the hospital's cost per discharge for the 
Federal fiscal year 1987 base period.
    (g) Right to administrative and judicial review. An intermediary's 
determination of the hospital-specific rate for a hospital is subject to 
administrative and judicial review. Review is available to a hospital 
upon receipt of the notice of the hospital-specific rate. This notice is 
treated as a final intermediary determination of the amount of program 
reimbursement for purposes of subpart R of part 405 of this chapter, 
governing provider reimbursement determinations and appeals.
    (h) Modification of hospital-specific rate. (1) The intermediary 
recalculates the hospital-specific rate to reflect the following:
    (i) Any modifications that are determined as a result of 
administrative or judicial review of the hospital-specific rate 
determinations; or
    (ii) Any additional costs that are recognized as allowable costs for 
the hospital's base period as a result of administrative or judicial 
review of the base-period notice of amount of program reimbursement.
    (2) With respect to either the hospital-specific rate determination 
or the amount of program reimbursement determination, the actions taken 
on administrative or judicial review that provide a basis for 
recalculations of the hospital-specific rate include the following:

[[Page 310]]

    (i) A reopening and revision of the hospital's base-period notice of 
amount of program reimbursement under Secs. 405.1885 through 405.1889 of 
this chapter.
    (ii) A prehearing order or finding issued during the provider 
payment appeals process by the appropriate reviewing authority under 
Sec. 405.1821 or Sec. 405.1853 of this chapter that resolved a matter at 
issue in the hospital's base-period notice of amount of program 
reimbursement.
    (iii) An affirmation, modification, or reversal of a Provider 
Reimbursement Review Board decision by the Administrator of HCFA under 
Sec. 405.1875 of this chapter that resolved a matter at issue in the 
hospital's base-period notice of amount of program reimbursement.
    (iv) An administrative or judicial review decision under 
Secs. 405.1831, 405.1871, or 405.1877 of this chapter that is final and 
no longer subject to review under applicable law or regulations by a 
higher reviewing authority, and that resolved a matter at issue in the 
hospital's base-period notice of amount of program reimbursement.
    (v) A final, nonappealable court judgment relating to the base-
period costs.
    (3) The adjustments to the hospital-specific rate made under 
paragraphs (h) (1) and (2) of this section are effective retroactively 
to the time of the intermediary's initial determination of the rate.

Sec. 412.76  Recovery of excess transition period payment amounts resulting from unlawful claims.

    If a hospital's base-year costs, as estimated for purposes of 
determining the hospital-specific portion, are determined, by criminal 
conviction or imposition of a civil money penalty or assessment, to 
include costs that were unlawfully claimed, the hospital's base-period 
costs are adjusted to remove the effect of the excess costs, and HCFA 
recovers both the excess costs reimbursed for the base period and the 
additional amounts paid due to the inappropriate increase of the 
hospital-specific portion of the hospital's transition payment rates.

                  Subpart F--Payment for Outlier Cases


<R05>
412.80   General provisions.

    (a) Basic rule--(1) Discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994 
and before October 1, 1997. For discharges occurring on or after October 
1, 1994, and before October 1, 1997, except as provided in paragraph (b) 
of this section concerning transferring hospitals, HCFA provides for 
additional payment, beyond standard DRG payments, to a hospital for 
covered inpatient hospital services furnished to a Medicare beneficiary 
if either of the following conditions is met:
    (i) The beneficiary's length-of-stay (including days at the SNF 
level of care if a SNF bed is not available in the area) exceeds the 
mean length-of-stay for the applicable DRG by the lesser of the 
following:
    (A) A fixed number of days, as specified by HCFA; or
    (B) A fixed number of standard deviations, as specified by HCFA.
    (ii) The beneficiary's length-of-stay does not exceed criteria 
established under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, but the 
hospital's charges for covered services furnished to the beneficiary, 
adjusted to operating costs and capital costs by applying cost-to-charge 
ratios as described in Sec. 412.84(h), exceed the DRG payment for the 
case plus a fixed dollar amount (adjusted for geographic variation in 
costs) as specified by HCFA.
    (2) Discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997. For discharges 
occurring on or after October 1, 1997, except as provided in paragraph 
(b) of this section concerning transfers, HCFA provides for additional 
payment, beyond standard DRG payments, to a hospital for covered 
inpatient hospital services furnished to a Medicare beneficiary if the 
hospital's charges for covered services, adjusted to operating costs and 
capital costs by applying cost-to-charge ratios as described in 
Sec. 412.84(h), exceed the DRG payment for the case plus a fixed dollar 
amount (adjusted for

[[Page 311]]

geographic variation in costs) as specified by HCFA.
    (b) Outlier cases in transferring hospitals. HCFA provides cost 
outlier payments to a transferring hospital that does not receive 
payment under Sec. 412.2(b) for discharges specified in 
Sec. 412.4(d)(2), if the hospital's charges for covered services 
furnished to the beneficiary, adjusted to cost by applying a national 
cost/charge ratio, exceed the DRG payment for the case plus a fixed 
dollar amount (adjusted for geographic variation in costs) as specified 
by HCFA, divided by the geometric mean length of stay for the DRG and 
multiplied by the beneficiary's length of stay plus 1 day.
    (c) Publication and revision of outlier criteria. HCFA will issue 
threshold criteria for determining outlier payment in the annual notice 
of the prospective payment rates published in accordance with 
Sec. 412.8(b).

[62 FR 46028, Aug. 29, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 412.82  Payment for extended length-of-stay cases (day outliers).

    (a) For discharges occurring before October 1, 1997, if the hospital 
stay reflected by a discharge includes covered days of care beyond the 
applicable threshold criterion, the intermediary will make an additional 
payment, on a per diem basis, to the discharging hospital for those 
days. A special request or submission by the hospital is not necessary 
to initiate this payment. However, a hospital may request payment for 
day outliers before the medical review required in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (b) The PRO must review and approve to the extent required by HCFA--
    (1) The medical necessity and appropriateness of the admission and 
outlier services in the context of the entire stay;
    (2) The validity of the diagnostic and procedural coding; and
    (3) The granting of grace days.
    (c) Except as provided in Sec. 412.86, the per diem payment made 
under paragraph (a) of this section is derived by taking a percentage of 
the average per diem payment for the applicable DRG, as calculated by 
dividing the Federal prospective payment rate for inpatient operating 
costs and inpatient capital-related costs determined under subpart D of 
this part, by the arithmetic mean length of stay for that DRG. HCFA 
issues the applicable percentage of the average per diem payment in the 
annual publication of the prospective payment rates in accordance with 
Sec. 412.8(b).
    (d) Any days in a covered stay identified as noncovered reduce the 
number of days reimbursed at the day outlier rate but not to exceed the 
number of days that occur after the day outlier threshold.

[50 FR 12741, Mar. 29, 1985, as amended at 50 FR 15326, Apr. 17, 1985; 
50 FR 35689, Sept. 3, 1985; 53 FR 38529, Sept. 30, 1988; 57 FR 39822, 
Sept. 1, 1992; 59 FR 45398, Sept. 1, 1994; 62 FR 46028, Aug. 29, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 412.84  Payment for extraordinarily high-cost cases (cost outliers).

    (a) A hospital may request its intermediary to make an additional 
payment for inpatient hospital services that meet the criteria 
established in accordance with Sec. 412.80(a).
    (b) The hospital must request additional payment--
    (1) With initial submission of the bill; or
    (2) Within 60 days of receipt of the intermediary's initial 
determination.
    (c) Except as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, an 
additional payment for a cost outlier case is made prior to medical 
review.
    (d) As described in paragraph (f) of this section, the PRO reviews a 
sample of cost outlier cases after payment. The charges for any services 
identified as noncovered through this review are denied and any outlier 
payment made for these services are recovered, as appropriate, after a 
determination as to the provider's liability has been made.
    (e) If the PRO finds a pattern of inappropriate utilization by a 
hospital, all cost outlier cases from that hospital are subject to 
medical review, and this review may be conducted prior to payment until 
the PRO determines that appropriate corrective actions have been taken.
    (f) The PRO reviews the cost outlier cases, using the medical 
records and itemized charges, to verify the following:

[[Page 312]]

    (1) The admission was medically necessary and appropriate.
    (2) Services were medically necessary and delivered in the most 
appropriate setting.
    (3) Services were ordered by the physician, actually furnished, and 
not duplicatively billed.
    (4) The diagnostic and procedural codings are correct.
    (g) The intermediary bases the operating and capital costs of the 
discharge on the billed charges for covered inpatient services adjusted 
by the cost to charge ratios applicable to operating and capital costs, 
respectively, as described in paragraph (h) of this section.
    (h) The operating cost-to-charge ratio and, effective with cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991, the capital 
cost-to-charge ratio used to adjust covered charges are computed 
annually by the intermediary for each hospital based on the latest 
available settled cost report for that hospital and charge data for the 
same time period as that covered by the cost report. Statewide cost-to-
charge ratios are used in those instances in which a hospital's 
operating or capital cost-to-charge ratios fall outside reasonable 
parameters. HCFA sets forth these parameters and the statewide cost-to-
charge ratios in each year's annual notice of prospective payment rates 
published under Sec. 412.8(b).
    (i) If any of the services are determined to be noncovered, the 
charges for these services will be deducted from the requested amount of 
reimbursement but not to exceed the amount claimed above the cost 
outlier threshold.
    (j) Except as provided in paragraph (k) of this section, the 
additional amount is derived by first taking 80 percent of the 
difference between the hospital's adjusted operating cost for the 
discharge (as determined under paragraph (g) of this section) and the 
operating threshold criteria established under Sec. 412.80(a)(1)(ii); 80 
percent is also taken of the difference between the hospital's adjusted 
capital cost for the discharge (as determined under paragraph (g) of 
this section) and the capital threshold criteria established under 
Sec. 412.80(a)(1)(ii). The resulting capital amount is then multiplied 
by the applicable Federal portion of the payment as determined in 
Sec. 412.340(a) or Sec. 412.344(a).
    (k) For discharges occurring on or after April 1, 1988, the 
additional payment amount for the DRGs related to burn cases, which are 
identified in the most recent annual notice of prospective payment rates 
published in accordance with Sec. 412.8(b), is computed under the 
provisions of paragraph (j) of this section except that the payment is 
made using 90 percent of the difference between the hospital's adjusted 
cost for the discharge and the threshold criteria.

that qualifies for an additional payment under the provisions of 
Sec. 412.82 has charges adjusted to costs that exceed the cost outlier 
threshold criteria for an extraordinarily high-cost case as set forth in 
Sec. 412.80(a)(1)(ii), the additional payment made for the discharge is 
the greater of--
    (a) The applicable per diem payment computed under Sec. 412.82 (c) 
or (d); or
    (b) The payment that would be made under Sec. 412.84 (i) or (j) if 
the case had not met the day outlier criteria threshold set forth in 
Sec. 412.80(a)(1)(i).

Subpart G--Special Treatment of Certain Facilities Under the Prospective 
              Payment System for Inpatient Operating Costs


<R05>
Sec. 412.90  General rules.

    (a) Sole community hospitals. HCFA may adjust the prospective 
payment rates for inpatient operating costs determined under subpart D 
or E of this part if a hospital, by reason of factors

[[Page 313]]

such as isolated location, weather conditions, travel conditions, or 
absence of other hosptials, is the sole source of inpatient hospital 
services reasonably available in a geographic area to Medicare 
beneficiaries. If a hospital meets the criteria for such an exception 
under Sec. 412.92(a), its prospective payment rates for inpatient 
operating costs are determined under Sec. 412.92(d).
    (b) Referral center. HCFA may adjust the prospective payment rates 
for inpatient operating costs determined under subpart D or E of this 
part if a hospital acts as a referral center for patients transferred 
from other hospitals. Criteria for identifying such referral centers are 
set forth in Sec. 412.96.
    (c) Christian Science Sanatoria. HCFA may adjust the prospective 
payment rates for inpatient operating costs determined under subpart D 
or E of this part if a hospital is a Christian Science sanatorium. Such 
a sanatorium's prospective payment rates are determined in accordance 
with Sec. 412.98.
    (d) Kidney acquisition costs incurred by hospitals approved as renal 
transplantation centers. HCFA pays for kidney acquisition costs incurred 
by renal transplanation centers on a reasonable cost basis. The criteria 
for this special payment provision are set forth in Sec. 412.100.
    (e) Hospitals that are located in urban areas and that are 
reclassified as rural. HCFA adjusts the rural Federal payment amounts 
for inpatient operating costs for hospitals reclassified as rural, as 
defined in Sec. 412.62(f). The criteria for this adjustment are set 
forth in Sec. 412.102.
    (f) Hospitals that have a high percentage of ESRD beneficiary 
discharges. HCFA makes an additional payment to a hospital if ten 
percent or more of its total Medicare discharges in a cost reporting 
period beginning on or after October 1, 1984 are ESRD beneficiary 
discharges. In determining ESRD discharges, discharges in DRG Nos. 302, 
316, and 317 are excluded. The criteria for this additional payment are 
set forth in Sec. 412.104.
    (g) Hosptials that incur indirect costs for graduate medical 
education programs. HCFA makes an additional payment for inpatient 
operating costs to a hospital for indirect medical education costs 
attributable to an approved graduate medical education program. The 
criteria for this additional payment are set forth in Sec. 412.105.
    (h) Hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income 
patients. For discharges occurring on or after May 1, 1986, HCFA makes 
an additional payment for inpatient operating costs to hospitals that 
serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The criteria for 
this additional payment are set forth in Sec. 412.106.
    (i) Hospitals that receive an additional update for FYs 1998 and 
1999. For FYs 1998 and 1999, HCFA makes an upward adjustment to the 
standardized amounts for certain hospitals that do not receive indirect 
medical education or disproportionate share payments and are not 
Medicare- dependent, small rural hospitals. The criteria for identifying 
these hospitals are set forth in Sec. 412.107.
    (j) Medicare-dependent, small rural hospitals. For cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after April 1, 1990 and ending before October 1, 
1994, or beginning on or after October 1, 1997 and ending before October 
1, 2001, HCFA adjusts the prospective payment rates for inpatient 
operating costs determined under subparts D and E of this part if a 
hospital is classified as a Medicare-dependent, small rural hospital. 
Criteria for identifying these hospitals are set forth in Sec. 412.108.
    (k) Essential access community hospitals (EACHs). If a hospital was 
designated as an EACH by HCFA as described in Sec. 412.109(a) and is 
located in a rural area as defined in Sec. 412.109(b), HCFA determines 
the prospective payment rate for that hospital, as it does for sole 
community hospitals, under Sec. 412.92(d).

Sec. 412.92  Special treatment: Sole community hospitals.

    (a) Criteria for classification as a sole community hospital. HCFA 
classifies a hospital as a sole community hospital if it is located more 
than 35 miles from other like hospitals, or it is located in a rural 
area (as defined in Sec. 412.83(b))

[[Page 314]]

and meets one of the following conditions:
    (1) The hospital is located between 25 and 35 miles from other like 
hospitals and meets one of the following criteria:
    (i) No more than 25 percent of residents who become hospital 
inpatients or no more than 25 percent of the Medicare beneficiaries who 
become hospital inpatients in the hospital's service area are admitted 
to other like hospitals located within a 35-mile radius of the hospital, 
or, if larger, within its service area;
    (ii) The hospital has fewer than 50 beds and the intermediary 
certifies that the hospital would have met the criteria in paragraph 
(a)(1)(i) of this section were it not for the fact that some 
beneficiaries or residents were forced to seek care outside the service 
area due to the unavailability of necessary specialty services at the 
community hospital; or
    (iii) Because of local topography or periods of prolonged severe 
weather conditions, the other like hospitals are inaccessible for at 
least 30 days in each 2 out of 3 years.
    (2) The hospital is located between 15 and 25 miles from other like 
hospitals but because of local topography or periods of prolonged severe 
weather conditions, the other like hospitals are inaccessible for at 
least 30 days in each 2 out of 3 years.
    (3) Because of distance, posted speed limits, and predictable 
weather conditions, the travel time between the hospital and the nearest 
like hospital is at least 45 minutes.
    (b) Classification procedures. (1) Request for classification as 
sole community hospital. (i) The hospital must make its request to its 
fiscal intermediary.
    (ii) If a hospital is seeking sole community hospital classification 
under paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the hospital 
must include the following information with its request:
    (A) The hospital must provide patient origin data (for example, the 
number of patients from each zip code from which the hospital draws 
inpatients) for all inpatient discharges to document the boundaries of 
its service area.
    (B) The hospital must provide patient origin data from all other 
hospitals located within a 35 mile radius of it or, if larger, within 
its service area, to document that no more than 25 percent of either all 
of the population or the Medicare beneficiaries residing in the 
hospital's service area and hospitalized for inpatient care were 
admitted to other like hospitals for care.
    (iii)(A) If the hospital is unable to obtain the information 
required under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section concerning the 
residences of Medicare beneficiaries who were inpatients in other 
hospitals located within a 50 mile radius of the hospital or, if larger, 
within the hospital's service area, the hospital may request that HCFA 
provide this information.
    (B) If a hospital obtains the information as requested under 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, that information is used by 
both the intermediary and HCFA in making the determination of the 
residences of Medicare beneficiaries under paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) and 
(b)(1)(iv) of this section, regardless of any other information 
concerning the residences of Medicare beneficiaries submitted by the 
hospital.
    (iv) The intermediary reviews the request and send the request, with 
its recommendation, to HCFA.
    (v) HCFA reviews the request and the intermediary's recommendation 
and forward its approval or disapproval to the intermediary.
    (2) Effective dates of classification. (i) Sole community hospital 
status is effective 30 days after the date of HCFA's written 
notification of approval.
    (ii) When a court order or a determination by the Provider 
Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB) reverses an HCFA denial of sole 
community hospital status and no further appeal is made, the sole 
community hospital status is effective as follows:
    (A) If the hospital's application was submitted prior to October 1, 
1983, its status as a sole community hospital is effective at the start 
of the cost reporting period for which it sought exemption from the cost 
limits.
    (B) If the hospital's application for sole community hospital status 
was filed on or after October 1, 1983, the effective date is 30 days 
after the date of

[[Page 315]]

HCFA's original written notification of denial.
    (iii) When a hospital is granted retroactive approval of sole 
community hospital status by a court order or a PRRB decision and the 
hospital wishes its sole community hospital status terminated before the 
date of the court order or PRRB determination, it must submit written 
notice to the HCFA regional office within 90 days of the court order or 
PRRB decision. A written request received after the 90-day period is 
effective no later than 30 days after the request is submitted.
    (iv) A hospital classified as a sole community hospital receives a 
payment djustment, as described in paragraph (d) of this section, 
effective with discharges occurring on or after 30 days after the date 
of HCFA's approval of the classification.
    (3) Duration of classification. An approved classification as a sole 
community hospital remains in effect without need for reapproval unless 
there is a change in the circumstances under which the classification 
was approved.
    (4) Cancellation of classification. (i) A hospital may at any time 
request cancellation of its classification as a sole community hospital, 
and be paid at rates determined under subparts D and E of this part, as 
appropriate.
    (ii) The cancellation becomes effective no later than 30 days after 
the date the hospital submits its request.
    (iii) If a hospital requests that its sole community hospital 
classification be cancelled, it may not be reclassified as a sole 
community hospital unless it meets the following conditions:
    (A) At least one full year has passed since the effective date of 
its cancellation.
    (B) The hospital meets the qualifying criteria set forth in 
paragraph (a) of this section in effect at the time it reapplies.
    (5) Automatic classification as a sole community hospital. A 
hospital that has been granted an exemption from the hospital cost 
limits before October 1, 1983, or whose request for the exemption was 
received by the appropriate intermediary before October 1, 1983, and was 
subsequently approved, is automatically classified as a sole community 
hospital unless that classification has been cancelled under paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section, or there is a change in the circumstances under 
which the classification was approved.
    (c) Terminology. As used in this section--
    (1) The term miles means the shortest distance in miles measured 
over improved roads. An improved road for this purpose is any road which 
is maintained by a local, State, or Federal government entity and which 
is available for use by the general public.
    (2) The term like hospital means a hospital furnishing short-term, 
acute care. HCFA will not evaluate comparability of specialty services 
in making determinations on classifications as sole community hospitals.
    (3) The term service area means the area from which a hospital draws 
at least 75 percent of its inpatients during the most recent 12-month 
cost reporting period ending before it applies for classification as a 
sole community hospital.
    (d) Determining prospective payment rates for inpatient operating 
costs for sole community hospitals. (1) General rule. For cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after April 1, 1990, a sole community hospital 
is paid based on whichever of the following amounts yields the greatest 
aggregate payment for the cost reporting period:
    (i) The Federal payment rate applicable to the hospitals as 
determined under Sec. 412.63, subject to the regional floor defined in 
Sec. 412.70(c)(6).
    (ii) The hospital-specific rate as determined under Sec. 412.73.
    (iii) The hospital-specific rate as determined under Sec. 412.75.
    (2) Adjustments to payments. A sole community hospital may receive 
an adjustment to its payments to take into account a significant 
decrease in number of discharges or a significant increase in inpatient 
operating costs, as described in paragraphs (e) and (g) of this section 
respectively.
    (e) Additional payments to sole community hospitals experiencing a 
significant volume decrease. (1) For cost reporting periods beginning on 
or after October 1, 1983, the intermediary provides for a

[[Page 316]]

payment adjustment for a sole community hospital for any cost reporting 
period during which the hospital experiences, due to circumstances as 
described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section a more than five percent 
decrease in its total discharges of inpatients as compared to its 
immediately preceding cost reporting period. If either the cost 
reporting period in question or the immediately preceding cost reporting 
period is other than a 12-month cost reporting period, the intermediary 
must convert the discharges to a monthly figure and multiply this figure 
by 12 to estimate the total number of discharges for a 12-month cost 
reporting period.
    (2) To qualify for a payment adjustment on the basis of a decrease 
in discharges, a sole community hospital must submit its request no 
later than 180 days after the date on the intermediary's Notice of 
Amount of Program Reimbursement--
    (i) Submit to the intermediary documentation demonstrating the size 
of the decrease in discharges, and the resulting effect on per discharge 
costs; and
    (ii) Show that the decrease is due to circumstances beyond the 
hospital's control.
    (3) The intermediary determines a lump sum adjustment amount not to 
exceed the difference between the hospital's Medicare inpatient 
operating costs and the hospital's total DRG revenue for inpatient 
operating costs based on DRG-adjusted prospective payment rates for 
inpatient operating costs (including outlier payments for inpatient 
operating costs determined under subpart F of this part and additional 
payments made for inpatient operating costs for hospitals that serve a 
disproportionate share of low-income patients as determined under 
Sec. 412.106 and for indirect medical education costs as determined 
under Sec. 412.105).
    (i) In determining the adjustment amount, the intermediary 
considers--
    (A) The individual hospital's needs and circumstances, including the 
reasonable cost of maintaining necessary core staff and services in view 
of minimum staffing requirements imposed by State agencies;
    (B) The hospital's fixed (and semi-fixed) costs, other than those 
costs paid on a reasonable cost basis under part 413 of this chapter; 
and
    (C) The length of time the hospital has experienced a decrease in 
utilization.
    (ii) The intermediary makes its determination within 180 days from 
the date it receives the hospital's request and all other necessary 
information.
    (iii) The intermediary determination is subject to review under 
subpart R of part 405 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 412.96  Special treatment: Referral centers.

    (a) Criteria for classification as a referral center: Basic rule. 
HCFA classifies a hospital as a referral center only if the hospital is 
a Medicare participating acute care hospital and meets the applicable 
criteria of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.
    (b) Criteria for cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 1983. The hospital meets either of the following criteria:
    (1) The hospital is located in a rural area (as defined in 
Sec. 412.63(b)) and has the following number of beds, as determined 
under the provisions of Sec. 412.105(b), available for use:
    (i) Effective for discharges occurring before April 1, 1988, the 
hospital has 500 or more beds.
    (ii) Effective for discharges occurring on or after April 1, 1988, 
the hospital has 275 or more beds during its most recently completed 
cost reporting period unless the hospital submits written documentation 
with its application that its bed count has changed since the close of 
its most recently completed cost reporting period for one or more of the 
following reasons:
    (A) Merger of two or more hospitals.
    (B) Reopening of acute care beds previously closed for renovation.

[[Page 317]]

    (C) Transfer to the prospective payment system of acute care beds 
previously classified as part of an excluded unit.
    (D) Expansion of acute care beds available for use and permanently 
maintained for lodging inpatients, excluding beds in corridors and other 
temporary beds.
    (2) The hospital shows that--(i) At least 50 percent of its Medicare 
patients are referred from other hospitals or from physicians not on the 
staff of the hospital; and
    (ii) At least 60 percent of the hospital's Medicare patients live 
more than 25 miles from the hospital, and at least 60 percent of all the 
services that the hospital furnishes to Medicare beneficiaries are 
furnished to beneficiaries who live more than 25 miles from the 
hospital.
    (c) Alternative criteria. For cost reporting periods beginning on or 
after October 1, 1985, a hospital that does not meet the criteria of 
paragraph (b) of this section is classified as a referral center if it 
is located in a rural area (as defined in Sec. 412.62(f)) and meets the 
criteria specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section and 
at least one of the three criteria specified in paragraphs (c)(3), 
(c)(4), and (c)(5) of this section.
    (1) Case-mix index. HCFA sets forth national and regional case-mix 
index values in each year's annual notice of prospective payment rates 
published under Sec. 412.8(b). The methodology HCFA uses to calculate 
these criteria is described in paragraph (g) of this section. The case-
mix index value to be used for an individual hospital in the 
determination of whether it meets the case-mix index criteria is that 
calculated by HCFA from the hospital's own billing records for Medicare 
discharges as processed by the fiscal intermediary and submitted to 
HCFA. The hospital's case-mix index for discharges (not including 
discharges from units excluded from the prospective payment system under 
subpart B of this part) during the most recent Federal fiscal year that 
ended at least one year prior to the beginning of the cost reporting 
period for which the hospital is seeking referral center status must be 
at least equal to-
    (i) For hospitals applying for rural referral center status for cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1985 and before 
October 1, 1986, the national or regional case-mix index value; or
    (ii) For hospitals applying for rural referral center status for 
cost--reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1986, the 
national case-mix index value as established by HCFA or the median case-
mix index value for urban hospitals located in each region. In 
calculating the median case-mix index for each region, HCFA excludes the 
case-mix indexes of hospitals receiving indirect medical education 
payments as provided in Sec. 412.105.
    (2) Number of discharges. (i) HCFA sets forth the national and 
regional numbers of discharges in each year's annual notice of 
prospective payment rates published under Sec. 412.8(b). The methodology 
HCFA uses to calculate these criteria is described in paragraph (h) of 
this section. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section 
for an osteopathic hospital, for the hospital's most recently completed 
cost reporting period, its number of discharges (not including 
discharges from units excluded from the prospective payment system under 
subpart B of this part or from newborn units) is at least equal to--
    (A) For hospitals applying for rural referral center status for cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1985 and before 
October 1, 1986, the number of discharges under either the national or 
regional criterion; or
    (B) For hospitals applying for rural referral center status for cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1986, 5,000 
discharges or, if less, the median number of discharges for urban 
hospitals located in each region.
    (ii) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 
1986, an osteopathic hospital, recognized by the American Osteopathic 
Healthcare Association (or any successor organization), that is located 
in a rural area must have at least 3,000 discharges during its most 
recently completed cost reporting period to meet the number of 
discharges criterion. The 3,000 discharches benchmark is also used in

[[Page 318]]

evaluating an osteopathic hospital for purposes of the triennial review.
    (3) Medical staff. More than 50 percent of the hospital's active 
medical staff are specialists who meet one of the following conditions:
    (i) Are certified as specialists by one of the Member Boards of the 
American Board of Medical Specialties or the Advisory Board of 
Osteopathic Specialists.
    (ii) Have completed the current training requirements for admission 
to the certification examination of one of the Member Boards of the 
American Board of Medical Specialties or the Advisory Board of 
Osteopathic Specialists.
    (iii) Have successfully completed a residency program in a medical 
specialty accredited by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical 
Education or the American Osteopathic Association.
    (4) Source of inpatients. At least 60 percent of all its discharges 
are for inpatients who reside more than 25 miles from the hospital.
    (5) Volume of referrals. At least 40 percent of all inpatients 
treated at the hospital are referred from other hospitals or from 
physicians not on the hospital's staff.
    (d) Payment to rural referral centers. Effective for discharges 
occurring on or after April 1, 1988, and before October 1, 1994, a 
hospital that is located in a rural area and meets the criteria of 
paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2) or (c) of this section is paid prospective 
payments for inpatient operating costs per discharge based on the 
applicable other urban payment rates as determined in accordance with 
Sec. 412.63, as adjusted by the hospital's area wage index.
    (e)-(f) [Reserved]
    (g) Hospital cancellation of referral center status. (1) A hospital 
may at any time request cancellation of its status as a referral center 
and be paid prospective payments per discharge based on the applicable 
rural rate as determined in accordance with Sec. 412.63, as adjusted by 
the hospital's area wage index value.
    (2) The cancellation becomes effective no later than 30 days after 
the date the hospital submits its request.
    (3) If a hospital requests that its referral center status be 
canceled, it may not be reclassified as a referral center unless it 
meets the qualifying criteria set forth in paragraph (a) of this section 
in effect at the time it reapplies.
    (h) Methodology for calculating case-mix index criteria. HCFA 
calculates the national and regional case-mix index value criteria as 
described in paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(4) of this section.
    (1) Updating process. HCFA updates the national and regional case-
mix index standards using the latest available data from hospitals 
subject to the prospective payment system for the Federal fiscal year.
    (2) Source of data. In making the calculations described in 
paragraph (g)(1) of this section, HCFA uses all inpatient hospital bills 
received for discharges subject to prospective payment during the 
Federal fiscal year being monitored.
    (3) Effective date. HCFA sets forth the national and regional 
criteria in the annual notice of prospective payment rates published 
under Sec. 412.8(b). These criteria are used to determine if a hospital 
qualifies for referral center status for cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after October 1 of the Federal fiscal year to which the 
notice applies.
    (4) Applicability of criteria to HCFA review of referral center 
status. For purposes of the triennial HCFA review of a referral center's 
status as described in paragraph (f) of this section, the referral 
center's case-mix index value for a Federal fiscal year is evaluated 
using the appropriate case-mix value criteria published in the annual 
notice of prospective payment rates.
    (i) Methodology for calculating number of discharges criteria. For 
purposes of determining compliance with the national or regional number 
of discharges criterion under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, HCFA 
calculates the criteria as follows:
    (1) Updating process. HCFA updates the national and regional number 
of discharges using the latest available data for levels of admissions 
or discharges or both.
    (2) Source of data. In making the calculations described in 
paragraph (h)(1)

[[Page 319]]

of this section, HCFA uses the most recent hospital admissions or 
discharge data available.
    (3) Annual notice. HCFA sets forth the national and regional 
criteria in the annual notice of prospective payment rates published 
under Sec. 412.8(b). These criteria are compared to an applying 
hospital's number of discharges for its most recently completed cost 
reporting period in determining if the hospital qualifies for referral 
center status for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1 
of the Federal fiscal year to which the notice applies.
    (4) Applicability of criteria to HCFA review of referral center 
status. For purposes of the triennial review of a referral center's 
status as described in paragraph (f) of this section, the referral 
center's number of discharges for its most recently completed cost 
reporting period is evaluated using the appropriate discharge criteria 
published in the annual notice of prospective payment rates.

section of this volume.


<R05>
Sec. 412.98  Special treatment: Christian Science Sanatoria.

    (a) General rule. If a Christian Science Sanatorium is not excluded 
from the prospective payment systems under subpart B of this part, HCFA 
pays, for inpatient hospital services furnished to a beneficiary by that 
sanatorium, a predetermined fixed amount per discharge based on the 
sanatorium's historical inpatient operating costs per discharge.
    (b) Prospective payment rates. For cost reporting periods beginning 
on or after October 1, 1983, the sanatorium's prospective payment rate 
for inpatient operating costs equals the amount that would constitute 
the sanatorium's target amount under Sec. 413.40(c)(4) of this chapter 
if the institution were subject to the rate of increase ceiling 
specified in Sec. 413.40 of this chapter instead of the prospective 
payment systems. This amount is not adjusted for the DRG weighting 
factor.
    (c) Outlier payments. A Christian Science sanatorium is not eligible 
for outlier payments under subpart F of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 412.100  Special treatment: Renal transplantation centers.

    (a) Adjustments for renal transplantation centers. (1) HCFA adjusts 
the prospective payment rates for inpatient operating costs determined 
under subparts D and E of this part for hospitals approved as renal 
transplantation centers (described at Secs. 405.2170 and 405.2171 of 
this chapter) to remove the estimated net expenses associated with 
kidney acquisition.
    (2) Kidney acquisition costs are treated apart from the prospective 
payment rate for inpatient operating costs, and payment to the hospital 
is adjusted in each reporting period to reflect an amount necessary to 
compensate the hospital for reasonable expenses of kidney acquisition.
    (b) Costs of kidney acquisition. Expenses recognized under this 
section include costs of acquiring a kidney, from a live donor or a 
cadaver, irrespective of whether the kidney was obtained by the hospital 
or through an organ procurement agency. These costs include--
    (1) Tissue typing, including tissue typing furnished by independent 
laboratories;
    (2) Donor and recipient evaluation;
    (3) Other costs associated with excising kidneys, such as donor 
general routine and special care services;
    (4) Operating room and other inpatient ancillary services applicable 
to the donor;
    (5) Preservation and perfusion costs;
    (6) Charges for registration of recipient with a kidney transplant 
registry;
    (7) Surgeons' fees for excising cadaver kidneys;
    (8) Transportation;
    (9) Costs of kidneys acquired from other providers or kidney 
procurement organizations;
    (10) Hospital costs normally classified as outpatient costs 
applicable to kidney excisions (services include donor and donee tissue 
typing, work-up, and related services furnished prior to admission);

[[Page 320]]

    (11) Costs of services applicable to kidney excisions which are 
rendered by residents and interns not in approved teaching programs; and
    (12) All pre-admission physicians services, such as laboratory, 
electroencephalography, and surgeon fees for cadaver excisions, 
applicable to kidney excisions including the costs of physicians 
services.

Sec. 412.102  Special treatment: Hospitals reclassified as rural.

    Effective on or after October 1, 1983, a hospital reclassified as 
rural, as defined in Sec. 412.62(f), may receive an adjustment to its 
rural Federal payment amount for operating costs for two successive 
fiscal years.
    (a) First year adjustment. The hospital's rural average standardized 
amount and disproportionate share payments as described in Sec. 412.106 
are adjusted on the basis of an additional amount that equals two-thirds 
of the difference between the urban standardized amount and 
disproportionate share payments applicable to the hospital before its 
reclassification and the rural standardized amount and disproportionate 
share payments otherwise applicable to the Federal fiscal year for which 
the adjustment is made.
    (b) Second year adjustment. If a hospital continues to be 
reclassified as rural, its rural average standardized amount and 
disproportionate share payments are adjusted on the basis of an 
additional amount that equals one-third of the difference between the 
urban standardized amount and disproportionate share payments applicable 
to the hospital before its reclassification and the rural standardized 
amounts and disproportionate share payments otherwise applicable to the 
Federal fiscal year for which the adjustment is made.

Sec. 412.104  Special treatment: Hospitals with high percentage of ESRD discharges.

    (a) Criteria for classification. Effective with cost reporting 
periods that begin on or after October 1, 1984, HCFA provides an 
additional payment to a hospital for inpatient dialysis provided to ESRD 
beneficiaries if the hospital has established that ESRD beneficiary 
discharges, excluding discharges classified into DRG No. 302 (Kidney 
Transplant), DRG No. 316 (Renal Failure) or DRG No. 317 (Admit for Renal 
Dialysis), constitute ten percent or more of its total Medicare 
discharges.
    (b) Additional payment. A hospital that meets the criteria of 
paragraph (a) of this section is paid an additional payment for each 
ESRD beneficiary discharge except those excluded under paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (1) The payment is based on the estimated weekly cost of dialysis 
and the average length of stay of ESRD beneficiaries for the hospital.
    (2) The estimated weekly cost of dialysis is the average number of 
dialysis sessions furnished per week during the 12-month period that 
ended June 30, 1983 multiplied by the average cost of dialysis for the 
same period.
    (3) The average cost of dialysis includes only those costs 
determined to be directly related to the dialysis service. (These costs 
include salary, employee health and welfare, drugs, supplies, and 
laboratory services.)
    (4) The average cost of dialysis is reviewed and adjusted, if 
appropriate, at the time the composite rate reimbursement for outpatient 
dialysis is reviewed.
    (5) The payment to a hospital equals the average length of stay of 
ESRD beneficiaries in the hospital, expressed as a ratio to one week, 
times the estimated weekly cost of dialysis multiplied by the number of 
ESRD beneficiary discharges except for those excluded under paragraph 
(a) of this section. This payment is made only on the Federal portion of 
the payment rate.

Sec. 412.105  Special treatment: Hospitals that incur indirect costs for graduate medical education programs.

    HCFA makes an additional payment to hospitals for indirect medical 
education costs using the following procedures:
    (a) Basic data. HCFA determines the following for each hospital:

[[Page 321]]

    (1) The hospital's ratio of full-time equivalent residents, except 
as limited under paragraph (f) of this section, to the number of beds 
(as determined in paragraph (b) of this section). For a hospital's cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1997, this ratio may 
not exceed the ratio for the hospital's most recent prior cost reporting 
period.
    (2) The hospital's DRG revenue for inpatient operating costs based 
on DRG-adjusted prospective payment rates for inpatient operating costs, 
excluding outlier payments for inpatient operating costs determined 
under subpart F of this part and additional payments made under the 
provisions of Sec. 412.106 .
    (b) Determination of number of beds. For purposes of this section, 
the number of beds in a hospital is determined by counting the number of 
available bed days during the cost reporting period, not including beds 
or bassinets in the healthy newborn nursery, custodial care beds, or 
beds in excluded distinct part hospital units, and dividing that number 
by the number of days in the cost reporting period.
    (c) Measurement for teaching activity. The factor representing the 
effect of teaching activity on inpatient operating costs equals .405 for 
discharges occurring on or after May 1, 1986.
    (d) Determination of education adjustment factor. Each hospital's 
education adjustment factor is calculated as follows:
    (1) Step one. A factor representing the sum of 1.00 plus the 
hospital's ratio of full-time equivalent residents to beds, as 
determined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, is raised to an 
exponential power equal to the factor set forth in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (2) Step two. The factor derived from step one is reduced by 1.00.
    (3) Step three. The factor derived from completing steps one and two 
is multiplied by `c', and where `c' is equal to the following:
    (i) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1988, and before 
October 1, 1997, 1.89.
    (ii) For discharges occurring during fiscal year 1998, 1.72.
    (iii) For discharges occurring during fiscal year 1999, 1.6.
    (iv) For discharges occurring during fiscal year 2000, 1.47.
    (v) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2000, 1.35.
    (e) Determination of payment amount. Each hospital's indirect 
medical education payment under the prospective payment system for 
inpatient operating costs is determined by multiplying the total DRG 
revenue for inpatient operating costs, as determined under paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, by the applicable education adjustment factor 
derived in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (f) Determining the total number of full-time equivalent residents 
for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1991. (1) For 
cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1991, the count of 
full-time equivalent residents for the purpose of determining the 
indirect medical education adjustment is determined as follows:
    (i) The resident must be enrolled in an approved teaching program. 
An approved teaching program is one that meets one of the following 
requirements:
    (A) Is approved by one of the national organizations listed in 
Sec. 415.200(a) of this chapter.
    (B) May count towards certification of the participant in a 
specialty or subspecialty listed in the current edition of either of the 
following publications:
    (1) The Directory of Graduate Medical Education Programs published 
by the American Medical Association.
    (2) The Annual Report and Reference Handbook published by the 
American Board of Medical Specialties.
    (C) Is approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical 
Education (ACGME) as a fellowship program in geriatric medicine.
    (D) Is a program that would be accredited except for the accrediting 
agency's reliance upon an accreditation standard that requires an entity 
to perform an induced abortion or require, provide, or refer for 
training in the performance of induced abortions, or make arrangements 
for such training, regardless of whether the standard provides 
exceptions or exemptions.
    (ii) In order to be counted, the resident must be assigned to one of 
the following areas:

[[Page 322]]

    (A) The portion of the hospital subject to the prospective payment 
system.
    (B) The outpatient department of the hospital.
    (C) Effective for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997, 
the time spent by a resident in a nonhospital setting in patient care 
activities under an approved medical residency training program is 
counted towards the determination of full-time equivalency if the 
criteria set forth at Sec. 413.86(f)(1)(iii) are met.
    (iii) Full-time equivalent status is based on the total time 
necessary to fill a residency slot. No individual may be counted as more 
than one full-time equivalent. If a resident is assigned to more than 
one hospital, the resident counts as a partial full-time equivalent 
based on the proportion of time worked in any of the areas of the 
hospital listed in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, to the total 
time worked by the resident. A part-time resident or one working in an 
area of the hospital other than those listed under paragraph (g)(1)(ii) 
of this section (such as a freestanding family practice center or an 
excluded hospital unit) would be counted as a partial full-time 
equivalent based on the proportion of time assigned to an area of the 
hospital listed in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, compared to the 
total time necessary to fill a full-time internship or residency slot.
    (iv) Effective for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997, 
the total number of full-time equivalent residents in the fields of 
allopathic and osteopathic medicine in either a hospital or nonhospital 
setting that meets the criteria listed in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this 
section may not exceed the number of such full-time equivalent residents 
in the hospital with respect to the hospital's most recent cost 
reporting period ending on or before December 31, 1996.
    (v) For a hospital's cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 1997, and before October 1, 1998, the total number of full-
time equivalent residents for payment purposes is equal to the average 
of the actual full-time equivalent resident counts (subject to the 
requirements listed in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii)(C) and (f)(1)(iv) of this 
section) for that cost reporting period and the preceding cost reporting 
period. For a hospital's cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 1998, the total number of full-time equivalent residents for 
payment purposes is equal to the average of the actual full-time 
equivalent resident count (subject to the requirements listed in 
paragraphs (f)(10)(ii)(C) and (f)(1)(iv) of this section) for that cost 
reporting period and the preceding two cost reporting periods.
    (2) To include a resident in the full-time equivalent count for a 
particular cost reporting period, the hospital must furnish the 
following information. The information must be certified by an official 
of the hospital and, if different, an official responsible for 
administering the residency program.
    (i) A listing, by specialty, of all residents assigned to the 
hospital and providing services to the hospital during the cost 
reporting period.
    (ii) The name and social security number of each resident.
    (iii) The dates the resident is assigned to the hospital.
    (iv) The dates the resident is assigned to other hospitals or other 
freestanding providers and any nonprovider setting during the cost 
reporting period.
    (v) The proportion of the total time necessary to fill a residency 
slot that the resident is assigned to an area of the hospital listed 
under paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (3) Fiscal intermediaries must verify the correct count of 
residents.
    (g) Indirect medical education payment for managed care enrollees. 
For portions of cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 
1998, a payment is made to a hospital for indirect medical education 
costs, as determined under paragraph (e) of this section, for discharges 
associated with individuals who are enrolled under a risk-sharing 
contract with an eligible organization under section 1876 of the Act or 
with a Medicare+Choice organization under title XVIII, Part C of the Act 
during the period.

Sec. 412.105, see the List of Sections Affected in the Finding Aids 
section of this volume.


<R05>
Sec. 412.106  Special treatment: Hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients.

    (a) General considerations. (1) The factors considered in 
determining whether a hospital qualifies for a payment adjustment 
include the number of beds, the number of patient days, and the 
hospital's location.
    (i) The number of beds in a hospital is determined in accordance 
with Sec. 412.105(b).
    (ii) The number of patient days includes only those days 
attributable to areas of the hospital that are subject to the 
prospective payment system and excludes all others.
    (iii) The hospital's location, in an urban or rural area, is 
determined in accordance with the definitions in Sec. 412.62(f).
    (2) The payment adjustment is applied to the hospital's DRG revenue 
for inpatient operating costs based on DRG-adjusted prospective payment 
rates for inpatient operating costs, excluding outlier payments for 
inpatient operating costs under subpart F of this part and additional 
payments made under the provisions of Sec. 412.105.
    (b) Determination of a hospital's disproportionate patient 
percentage. (1) General rule. A hospital's disproportionate patient 
percentage is determined by adding the results of two computations and 
expressing that sum as a percentage.
    (2) First computation: Federal fiscal year. For each month of the 
Federal fiscal year in which the hospital's cost reporting period 
begins, HCFA--
    (i) Determines the number of covered patient days that--
    (A) Are associated with discharges occurring during each month; and
    (B) Are furnished to patients who during that month were entitled to 
both Medicare Part A and SSI, excluding those patients who received only 
State supplementation;
    (ii) Adds the results for the whole period; and
    (iii) Divides the number determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of 
this section by the total number of patient days that--
    (A) Are associated with discharges that occur during that period; 
and
    (B) Are furnished to patients entitled to Medicare Part A.
    (3) First computation: Cost reporting period. If a hospital prefers 
that HCFA use its cost reporting period instead of the Federal fiscal 
year, it must furnish to HCFA, through its intermediary, a written 
request including the hospital's name, provider number, and cost 
reporting period end date. This exception will be performed once per 
hospital per cost reporting period, and the resulting percentage becomes 
the hospital's official Medicare Part A/SSI percentage for that period.
    (4) Second computation. The fiscal intermediary determines, for the 
hospital's cost reporting period, the number of patient days furnished 
to patients entitled to Medicaid but not to Medicare part A, and divides 
that number by the total number of patient days in that same period.
    (5) Disproportionate patient percentage. The intermediary adds the 
results of the first computation made under either paragraph (b)(2) or 
(b)(3) of this section and the second computation made under paragraph 
(b)(4) of this section and expresses that sum as a percentage. This is 
the hospital's disproportionate patient percentage, and is used in 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Criteria for classification. A hospital is classified as a 
``disproportionate share'' hospital under any of the following 
circumstances:
    (1) The hospital's disproportionate patient percentage, as 
determined under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, is at least equal to 
one of the following:
    (i) 15 percent, if the hospital is located in an urban area and has 
100 or more beds, or is located in a rural area and has 500 or more 
beds.
    (ii) 30 percent, if the hospital is located in a rural area and 
either has more than 100 beds and fewer than 500 beds or is classified 
as a sole community hospital under Sec. 412.92 of this subpart.
    (iii) 40 percent, if the hospital is located in an urban area and 
has fewer than 100 beds.

[[Page 324]]

    (iv) 45 percent, if the hospital is located in a rural area and has 
100 or fewer beds.
    (2) The hospital is located in an urban area, has 100 or more beds, 
and can demonstrate that, during its cost reporting period, more than 30 
percent of its net inpatient care revenues are derived from State and 
local government payments for care furnished to indigent patients.
    (d) Payment adjustment. (1) Method of adjustment. Subject to the 
reduction factor set forth in paragraph (e) of this section, if a 
hospital serves a disproportionate number of low-income patients, its 
DRG revenues for inpatient operating costs are increased by an 
adjustment factor as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (2) Payment adjustment factors. (i) If the hospital meets the 
criteria of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the payment adjustment 
factor is equal to one of the following:
    (A) If the hospital's disproportionate patient percentage is greater 
than 20.2 percent, the applicable payment adjustment factor is as 
follows:
    (1) For discharges occurring on or after April 1, 1990, and before 
January 1, 1991, 5.62 percent plus 65 percent of the difference between 
20.2 percent and the hospital's disproportionate patient percentage.
    (2) For discharges occurring on or after January 1, 1991, and before 
October 1, 1993, 5.62 percent plus 70 percent of the difference between 
20.2 percent and the hospital's disproportionate patient percentage.
    (3) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1993, and before 
October 1, 1994, 5.88 percent plus 80 percent of the difference between 
20.2 percent and the hospital's disproportionate patient percentage.
    (4) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994, 5.88 
percent plus 82.5 percent of the difference between 20.2 percent and the 
hospital's disproportionate patient percentage.
    (B) If the hospital's disproportionate patient percentage is less 
than 20.2 percent, the applicable payment adjustment factor is as 
follows:
    (1) For discharges occurring on or after April 1, 1990, and before 
October 1, 1993, 2.5 percent plus 60 percent of the difference between 
15 percent and the hospital's disproportionate patient percentage.
    (2) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1993, 2.5 
percent plus 65 percent of the difference between 15 percent and the 
hospital's disproportionate patient percentage.
    (ii) If the hospital meets the criteria of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of 
this section, the payment adjustment factor is equal to one of the 
following:
    (A) If the hospital is classified as a rural referral center, the 
payment adjustment factor is 4 percent plus 60 percent of the difference 
between the hospital's disproportionate patient percentage and 30 
percent.
    (B) If the hospital is classified as a sole community hospital, the 
payment adjustment factor is 10 percent.
    (C) If the hospital is classified as both a rural referral center 
and a sole community hospital, the payment adjustment factor is the 
greater of 10 percent or 4 percent plus 60 percent of the difference 
between the hospital's disproportionate patient percentage and 30 
percent.
    (D) If the hospital is not classified as either a sole community 
hospital or a rural referral center, the payment adjustment factor is 4 
percent.
    (iii) If the hospital meets the criteria of paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of 
this section, the payment adjustment factor is equal to 5 percent.
    (iv) If the hospital meets the criteria of paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of 
this section, the payment adjustment factor is 4 percent.
    (v) If the hospital meets the criteria of paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, the payment adjustment factor is as follows:
    (A) 30 percent for discharges occurring on or after April 1, 1990 
and before October 1, 1991.
    (B) 35 percent for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1991.
    (e) Reduction in payments for FYs 1998 through 2002. The amounts 
otherwise payable to a hospital under paragraph (d) of this section are 
reduced by the following:
    (1) For FY 1998, 1 percent.
    (2) For FY 1999, 2 percent.
    (3) For FY 2000, 3 percent.
    (4) For FY 2001, 4 percent.

[[Page 325]]

    (5) For FY 2002, 5 percent.
    (6) For FYs 2003 and thereafter, 0 percent.

412.107  Special treatment: Hospitals that receive an additional update for FYs 1998 and 1999.

    (a) Additional payment update. A hospital that meets the criteria 
set forth in paragraph (b) of this section receives the following 
increase to its applicable percentage amount set forth in Sec. 412.63 
(p) and (q):
    (1) For FY 1998, 0.5 percent.
    (2) For FY 1999, 0.3 percent.
    (b) Criteria for classification. A hospital is eligible for the 
additional payment update set forth in paragraph (a) of this section if 
it meets all of the following criteria:
    (1) Definition. The hospital is not a Medicare-dependent, small 
rural hospital as defined in Sec. 412.108(a) and does not receive any 
additional payment under the following provisions:
    (i) The indirect medical education adjustment made under 
Sec. 412.105.
    (ii) The disproportionate share adjustment made under Sec. 412.106.
    (2) State criteria. The hospital is located in a State in which the 
aggregate payment made under Sec. 412.112 (a) and (c) for hospitals 
described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for their cost reporting 
periods beginning in FY 1995 is less than the allowable operating costs 
described in Sec. 412.2(c) for those hospitals.
    (3) Hospital criteria. The aggregate payment made to the hospital 
under Sec. 412.112 (a) and (c) for the hospital's cost reporting period 
beginning in the fiscal year in which the additional payment update 
described in paragraph (a) of this section is made is less than the 
allowable operating cost described in Sec. 412.2(c) for that hospital.

[62 FR 46030, Aug. 29, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 412.108  Special treatment: Medicare-dependent, small rural hospitals.

    (a) Criteria for classification as a Medicare-dependent, small rural 
hospital.  (1) General considerations. For cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after April 1, 1990 and ending before October 1, 1994, 
or beginning on or after October 1, 1997 and ending before October 1, 
2001, a hospital is classified as a Medicare-dependent, small rural 
hospital if it is located in a rural area (as defined in Sec. 412.63(b)) 
and meets all of the following conditions:
    (i) The hospital has 100 or fewer beds as defined in Sec. 412.105(b) 
during the cost reporting period.
    (ii) The hospital is not also classified as a sole community 
hospital under Sec. 412.92.
    (iii) At least 60 percent of the hospital's inpatient days or 
discharges were attributable to individuals receiving Medicare part A 
benefits during the hospital's cost reporting period as follows, subject 
to the provisions of paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section:
    (A) The hospital's cost reporting period ending on or after 
September 30, 1987 and before September 30, 1988.
    (B) If the hospital does not have a cost reporting period that meets 
the criterion set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, the 
hospital's cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1986, 
and before October 1, 1987.
    (iv) If the cost reporting period determined under paragraph 
(a)(1)(iii) of this section is for less than 12 months, the hospital's 
most recent 12-month or longer cost reporting period before the short 
period is used.
    (2) Counting days and discharges. In counting inpatient days and 
discharges for purposes of meeting the criteria in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) 
of this section, only days and discharges from acute care inpatient 
hospital stays are counted (including days and discharges from swing 
beds when used for acute care inpatient hospital services), but not 
including days and discharges from units excluded from the prospective 
payment system under Secs. 412.25 through 412.30 or from newborn nursery 
units. For purposes of this section, a transfer as defined in 
Sec. 412.4(b) is considered to be a discharge.
    (b) Classification procedures. The fiscal intermediary determines 
whether a hospital meets the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section. 
If a hospital

[[Page 326]]

disagrees with an intermediary's decision, it should notify its 
intermediary and submit documentable evidence that it meets the 
criteria.
    (c) Payment methodology. A hospital that meets the criteria in 
paragraph (a) of this section is paid for its inpatient operating costs 
the sum of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.
    (1) The Federal payment rate applicable to the hospital as 
determined under Sec. 412.63, subject to the regional floor defined in 
Sec. 412.70(c)(6).
    (2) The amount, if any, determined as follows:
    (i) For discharges occurring during the first three 12-month cost 
reporting periods that begin on or after April 1, 1990, 100 percent of 
the amount that the Federal rate determined under paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section is exceeded by the higher of the following:
    (A) The hospital-specific rate as determined under Sec. 412.73.
    (B) The hospital-specific rate as determined under Sec. 412.75.
    (ii) For discharges occurring during any subsequent cost reporting 
period (or portion thereof) and before October 1, 1994, and for 
discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997 and before October 1, 
2001, 50 percent of the amount that the Federal rate determined under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section is exceeded by the higher of the 
following:
    (A) The hospital-specific rate as determined under Sec. 412.73.
    (B) The hospital-specific rate as determined under Sec. 412.75.
    (d) Additional payments to hospitals experiencing a significant 
volume decrease. (1) HCFA provides for a payment adjustment for a 
Medicare-dependent, small rural hospital for any cost reporting period 
during which the hospital experiences, due to circumstances as described 
in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a more than 5 percent decrease in 
its total inpatient discharges as compared to its immediately preceding 
cost reporting period. If either the cost reporting period in question 
or the immediately preceding cost reporting period is other than a 12-
month cost reporting period, the intermediary must convert the 
discharges to a monthly figure and multiply this figure by 12 to 
estimate the total number of discharges for a 12-month cost reporting 
period.
    (2) To qualify for a payment adjustment on the basis of a decrease 
in discharges, a Medicare-dependent, small rural hospital must submit 
its request no later than 180 days after the date on the intermediary's 
Notice of Amount of Program Reimbursement and it must--
    (i) Submit to the intermediary documentation demonstrating the size 
of the decrease in discharges and the resulting effect on per discharge 
costs; and
    (ii) Show that the decrease is due to circumstances beyond the 
hospital's control.
    (3) The intermediary determines a lump sum adjustment amount not to 
exceed the difference between the hospital's Medicare inpatient 
operating costs and the hospital's total DRG revenue for inpatient 
operating costs based on DRG-adjusted prospective payment rates for 
inpatient operating costs (including outlier payments for inpatient 
operating costs determined under subpart F of this part and additional 
payments made for inpatient operating costs hospitals that serve a 
disproportionate share of low-income patients as determined under 
Sec. 412.106 and for indirect medical education costs as determined 
under Sec. 412.105).
    (i) In determining the adjustment amount, the intermediary 
considers--
    (A) The individual hospital's needs and circumstances, including the 
reasonable cost of maintaining necessary core staff and services in view 
of minimum staffing requirements imposed by State agencies;
    (B) The hospital's fixed (and semi-fixed) costs, other than those 
costs paid on a reasonable cost basis under part 413 of this chapter; 
and
    (C) The length of time the hospital has experienced a decrease in 
utilization.
    (ii) The intermediary makes its determination within 180 days from 
the date it receives the hospital's request and all other necessary 
information.

[[Page 327]]

    (iii) The intermediary determination is subject to review under 
subpart R of part 405 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 412.109  Special treatment: Essential access community hospitals (EACHs).

    (a) General rule. For payment purposes, HCFA treats as a sole 
community hospital any hospital that is located in a rural area as 
described in paragraph (b) of this section and that HCFA designated as 
an EACH under section 1820(i)(1) of the Act as in effect on September 
30, 1997, for as long as the hospital continues to comply with the 
terms, conditions, and limitations that were applicable at the time HCFA 
designated the hospital as an EACH. The payment methodology for sole 
community hospitals is set forth at Sec. 412.92(d).
    (b) Location in a rural area. For purposes of this section, a 
hospital is located in a rural area if it--
    (1) Is located outside any area that is a Metropolitan Statistical 
Area as defined by the Office of Management and Budget or that has been 
recognized as urban under Sec. 412.62;
    (2) Is not deemed to be located in an urban area under Sec. 412.63;
    (3) Is not classified as an urban hospital for purposes of the 
standardized payment amount by HCFA or the Medicare Geographic 
Classification Review Board; or
    (4) Is not located in a rural county that has been redesignated to 
an adjacent urban area under Sec. 412.232.
    (c) Adjustment to the hospital-specific rate for rural EACH's 
experiencing increased costs. (1) General rule. HCFA increases the 
applicable hospital-specific rate of an EACH that it treats as a sole 
community hospital if, during a cost reporting period, the hospital 
experiences an increase in its Medicare inpatient operating costs per 
discharge that is directly attributable to activities related to its 
membership in a rural health network.
    (2) Request and documentation. In order for a hospital to qualify 
for an increase in its hospital-specific rate, it must meet the 
following criteria:
    (i) The hospital must submit its request to its intermediary no 
later than 180 days after the date on the intermediary's notice of 
program reimbursement.
    (ii) The request must include documentation specifically identifying 
the increased costs resulting from the hospital's participation in a 
rural health network and show that the increased costs during the cost 
reporting period will result in increased costs in subsequent cost 
reporting periods that are not already accounted for under the 
prospective payment system payment.
    (iii) The hospital must show that the cost increases are incremental 
costs that would not have been incurred in the absence of the hospital's 
membership in a rural health network.
    (iv) The hospital must show that the cost increases do not include 
amounts for start-up and one-time, nonrecurring costs attributable to 
its membership in a rural health network.
    (3) Intermediary recommendation. The intermediary forwards the 
following material to HCFA within 60 days of receipt from the hospital:
    (i) The hospital's documentation and the intermediary's verification 
of that documentation.
    (ii) The intermediary's analysis and recommendation of the request.
    (iii) The hospital's Medicare cost report for the year in which the 
increase in costs occurred and the prior year.
    (4) HCFA determination. HCFA determines, within 120 days of 
receiving all necessary information from the intermediary, whether an 
increase in the hospital-specific rate is warranted and, if it is, the 
amount of the increase. HCFA grants an adjustment only if a hospital's 
Medicare inpatient operating costs per discharge exceed the hospital's 
hospital-specific rate. The adjusted hospital-specific rate cannot 
exceed the hospital's Medicare inpatient operating costs per discharge 
for the cost reporting period.
    (d) Termination of EACH designation. If HCFA determines that a 
hospital no

[[Page 328]]

longer complies with the terms, conditions, and limitations that were 
applicable at the time HCFA designated the hospital as an EACH, HCFA 
will terminate the EACH designation of the hospital, effective with 
discharges occurring on or after 30 days after the date of the 
determination.
    (e) Review of HCFA determination. A determination by HCFA that a 
hospital's EACH designation should be terminated, is subject to review 
under part 405, subpart R of this chapter, including the time limits for 
filing requests for hearings as specified in Secs. 405.1811(a) and 
405.1841(a)(1) and (b) of this chapter.

F of this part.

[56 FR 43448, Aug. 30, 1991, as amended at 57 FR 39824, Sept. 1, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 412.113  Other payments.

    (a) Capital-related costs. (1) Payment. Subject to the reductions 
described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, payment for capital-
related costs (as described in Sec. 413.130 of this chapter) for cost 
reporting periods beginning before October 1, 1991 is determined on a 
reasonable cost basis.
    (2) Reduction to capital-related payments. (i) Except for sole 
community hospitals as defined in Sec. 412.92, the amount of capital-
related payments for cost-reporting periods beginning before October 1, 
1991 (including a return on equity capital as provided under 
Sec. 413.157 of this chapter) is reduced by--
    (A) Three and one-half percent for payments attributable to portions 
of cost reporting periods occurring during Federal FY 1987;
    (B) Seven percent for payments attributable to portions of cost 
reporting periods or discharges (as the case may be) occurring during 
fiscal year 1988 and before January 1, 1988;
    (C) Twelve percent for payments attributable to portions of cost 
reporting periods or discharges (as the case may be) in fiscal year 1988 
occurring on or after January 1, 1988;
    (D) Fifteen percent for payments attributable to portions of cost 
reporting periods or discharges (as the case may be) occurring during 
fiscal year 1989 and beginning on or after January 1, 1990 and ending on 
or before September 30, 1991; and
    (E) Ten percent for payments attributable to portions of cost-
reporting periods occurring on or after October 1, 1991 and before the 
beginning of the hospital's first cost-reporting period beginning on or 
after October 1, 1991.
    (ii) If a hospital's cost reporting period encompasses more than one 
Federal fiscal year, the reductions to capital-related payments are 
determined on a prorated monthly basis.
    (3) For cost-reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 
1991, a hospital with a hospital-specific rate above the Federal capital 
rate is paid a hold-harmless payment for old capital determined in 
accordance with subpart M of this part.
    (b) Direct medical education costs. (1) Payment for the direct 
medical education costs of interns and residents in

[[Page 329]]

approved programs for cost reporting periods beginning prior to July 1, 
1985, and for approved education activities of nurses and paramedical 
health professionals is made as described in Sec. 413.85 of this 
chapter.
    (2) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1985, 
payment for the direct medical education costs of interns and residents 
in approved programs is made as described in Sec. 413.86 of this 
chapter.
    (3) Except as provided in Sec. 413.86(c) of this chapter, for cost 
reporting periods during the prospective payment transition period, the 
costs of medical education must be determined in a manner that is 
consistent with the treatment of these costs for purposes of determining 
the hospital-specific portion of the payment rate as provided in subpart 
E of this part.
    (c) Anesthesia services furnished by hospital employed nonphysician 
anesthetists or obtained under arrangements. (1) For cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after October 1, 1984 through any part of a cost 
reporting period occurring before January 1, 1989, payment is determined 
on a reasonable cost basis for anesthesia services provided in the 
hospital by qualified nonphysician anesthetists (certified registered 
nurse anesthetists and anesthesiologist's assistants) employed by the 
hospital or obtained under arrangements.
    (2)(i) For cost reporting periods, or any part of a cost reporting 
period, beginning on or after January 1, 1989, through any part of a 
cost reporting period occurring before January 1, 1990, payment is 
determined on a reasonable cost basis for anesthesia services provided 
in a hospital by qualified nonphysician anesthetists employed by the 
hospital or obtained under arrangement, if the hospital demonstrates to 
its intermediary prior to April 1, 1989 that it meets the following 
criteria:
    (A) The hospital is located in a rural area as defined in 
Sec. 412.62(f) and is not deemed to be located in an urban area under 
the provisions of Sec. 412.64(b)(3).
    (B) The hospital must have employed or contracted with a qualified 
nonphysician anesthetist, as defined in Sec. 410.66 of this chapter, as 
of January 1, 1988 to perform anesthesia services in that hospital. The 
hospital may employ or contract with more than one anesthetist; however, 
the total number of hours of service furnished by the anesthetists may 
not exceed 2,080 hours per year.
    (C) The hospital must provide data for its entire patient population 
to demonstrate that, during calendar year 1987, its volume of surgical 
procedures (inpatient and outpatient) requiring anesthesia services did 
not exceed 250 procedures. For purposes of this section, a surgical 
procedure requiring anesthesia services means a surgical procedure in 
which the anesthesia is administered and monitored by a qualified 
nonphysician anesthetist, a physician other than the primary surgeon, or 
an intern or resident.
    (D) Each qualified nonphysician anesthetist employed by or under 
contract with the hospital has agreed in writing not to bill on a 
reasonable charge basis for his or her patient care in that hospital.
    (ii) To maintain its eligibility for reasonable cost payment under 
paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section in calendar years after 1989, a 
qualified hospital must demonstrate prior to January 1 of each 
respective year that for the prior year its volume of surgical 
procedures requiring anesthesia service did not exceed 500 procedures.
    (iii) A hospital that did not qualify for reasonable cost payment 
for nonphysician anesthetist services furnished in calendar year 1989 
can qualify for reasonable cost payment in subsequent calendar years, if 
it meets the criteria in Sec. 412.113(c)(2)(i) (A), (B) and (D) above, 
and demonstrates to its intermediary prior to the start of the calendar 
year that it met these criteria. The hospital must provide data for its 
entire patient population to demonstrate that, during calendar year 1987 
and the year immediately preceding its election of reasonable cost 
payment, its volume of surgical procedures (inpatient and outpatient) 
requiring anesthesia services did not exceed 500 procedures.
    (iv) For administrative purposes for the calendar years after 1990, 
the volume of surgical procedures for the immediately preceding year is 
the sum of the surgical procedures for the nine month period ending 
September 30,

[[Page 330]]

annualized for the twelve month period.
    (d) Organ acquisition. Payment for organ acquisition costs incurred 
by hospitals with approved transplantation centers is made on a 
reasonable cost basis. The term ``Organs'' is defined in Sec. 486.302 of 
this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 412.115  Additional payments.

    (a) Bad debts. An additional payment is made to each hospital in 
accordance with Sec. 413.80 of this chapter for bad debts attributable 
to deductible and coinsurance amounts related to covered services 
received by beneficiaries.
    (b) Administration of blood clotting factor. For discharges 
occurring on or after June 19, 1990, and before October 1, 1994, and for 
discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997, an additional payment 
is made to a hospital for each unit of blood clotting factor furnished 
to a Medicare inpatient who is a hemophiliac.
    (c) PRO photocopy and mailing costs. An additional payment is made 
to a hospital in accordance with Sec. 466.78 of this chapter for the 
costs of photocopying and mailing medical records requested by a PRO.

62 FR 46030, Aug. 29, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 412.116  Method of payment.

    (a) General rule. Unless the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
this section apply, hospitals are paid for hospital inpatient operating 
costs and capital-related costs for each discharge based on the 
submission of a discharge bill. Payments for inpatient hospital services 
furnished by an excluded psychiatric or a rehabilitation unit of a 
hospital are made as described in Sec. 413.64 (a), (c), (d), and (e) of 
this chapter.
    (b) Periodic interim payments--(1) Criteria for receiving periodic 
interim payments. Effective with claims received on or after July 1, 
1987, a hospital that meets the criteria in Sec. 413.64(h) of this 
chapter may request in writing to receive periodic interim payments as 
described in this paragraph. A hospital that is receiving periodic 
interim payments also receives payment on this basis for inpatient 
hospital services furnished by its excluded psychiatric or 
rehabilitation unit.
    (i) Failure of intermediary to make prompt payment. Beginning with 
claims received in April 1987, the hospital's fiscal intermediary does 
not meet the requirements of section 1816(c)(2) of the Act, which 
provides for prompt payment of claims under Medicare Part A, for three 
consecutive calendar months. The hospital may continue to receive 
periodic interim payments until the intermediary meets the requirements 
of section 1816 (c)(2) of the Act for three consecutive calendar months. 
For purposes of this paragraph, a hospital that is receiving periodic 
interim payments as of June 30, 1987 and meets the requirements of 
Sec. 413.64(h) of this chapter may continue to receive payment on this 
basis until the hospital's intermediary meets the requirements of 
section 1816(c)(2) of the Act for three consecutive calendar months 
beginning with April 1987.
    (ii) Hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income 
patients. The hospital is receiving periodic interim payments as of June 
30, 1987 and has a disproportionate share payment adjustment factor of 
at least 5.1 percent as determined under Sec. 412.106(c) for purposes of 
establishing the average standardized amounts for discharges occurring 
on or after October 1, 1986 and before October 1, 1987. The hospital's 
request must be made by a date prior to July 1, 1987, specified by the 
intermediary.
    (iii) Small rural hospitals. The hospital is receiving periodic 
interim payments as of June 30, 1987, makes its request by a date prior 
to July 1, 1987, specified by the intermediary, and, on July 1, 1987, 
the hospital--
    (A) Is located in a rural area as defined in Sec. 412.62(f); and
    (B) Has 100 or fewer beds available for use.
    (2) Frequency of payment. The intermediary estimates a hospital's 
prospective payments as described in

[[Page 331]]

paragraph (b)(3) of this section and makes biweekly payments equal to 1/
26 of the total estimated amount of payment for the year. Each payment 
is made two weeks after the end of a biweekly period of service, as 
described in Sec. 413.64(h)(5) of this chapter. These payments are 
subject to final settlement.
    (3) Amount of payment. (i) The biweekly interim payment amount is 
based on the total estimated Medicare discharges for the reporting 
period multiplied by the hospital's estimated average prospective 
payment amount as described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this paragraph. 
These interim payments are reviewed at least twice during the reporting 
period and adjusted if necessary. Fewer reviews may be necessary if a 
hospital receives interim payments for less than a full reporting 
period.
    (ii) For purposes of determining periodic interim payments under 
this paragraph, a hospital's estimated average prospective payment 
amount is computed as follows:
    (A) If a hospital has no payment experience under the prospective 
payment system for operating costs, the intermediary computes the 
hospital's estimated average prospective payment amount for operating 
costs by multiplying its payment rates as determined under 
Sec. 412.70(c), but without adjustment by a DRG weighting factor, by the 
hospital's case-mix index, and subtracting from this amount estimated 
deductibles and coinsurance.
    (B) Effective for cost-reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 1991, the intermediary computes a hospital's estimated 
average prospective payment amount for capital-related costs by 
multiplying its prospective payment rate as determined under 
Sec. 412.340 or Sec. 412.344(a), as applicable, and under Sec. 412.308 
for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2001 but 
without adjustment by a DRG weighting factor, by the hospital's case-mix 
index. The intermediary may take into account estimated additional 
payments per discharge under Sec. 412.348. If the hospital is paid under 
Sec. 412.344(a)(1), the intermediary includes an estimated payment for 
old capital costs per discharge.
    (C) If a hospital has payment experience under the prospective 
payment system for operating costs, and, for cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after October 1, 1991, for inpatient capital-related 
costs, the intermediary computes a hospital's estimated average 
prospective payment amount for operating costs and capital-related costs 
based on that payment experience, adjusted for projected changes, and 
subtracts from this amount estimated deductibles and coinsurance.
    (4) Termination of periodic interim payments--(i) Request by the 
hospital. A hospital receiving periodic interim payments may convert to 
payments on a per discharge basis at any time.
    (ii) Removal by the intermediary. An intermediary terminates 
periodic interim payments if--
    (A) A hospital no longer meets the requirements of Sec. 413.64(h);
    (B) A hospital is receiving payment under the criterion in paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section and the intemediary meets the prompt payment 
requirements of section 1816(c)(2) of the Act for three consecutive 
calendar months; or
    (C) A hospital that is receiving payment under the criterion set 
forth in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section no longer meets the 
criterion.
    (iii) Limitation on reelection. If a hospital that is receiving 
periodic interim payments under the criterion set forth in paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(1)(iii) of this section is removed from that method of 
payment at its own request, it may reelect to receive periodic interim 
payments only under the criterion set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of 
this section. However, if the hospital is removed from that method of 
payment by its intermediary because it no longer meets the requirements 
of Sec. 413.64(h) of this chapter, that hospital may subsequently 
reelect to receive periodic interim payments if it qualifies under the 
provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) or (b)(1)(iii) of this section, 
subject to the requirements in Sec. 413.64(h) of this chapter.
    (c) Special interim payments for certain costs. For capital-related 
costs for cost-reporting periods beginning before October 1, 1991 and 
the direct costs of

[[Page 332]]

medical education, which are not included in prospective payments but 
are reimbursed as specified in Secs. 413.130 and 413.85 of this chapter, 
respectively, interim payments are made subject to final cost 
settlement. Interim payments for capital-related items for cost-
reporting periods beginning before October 1, 1991 and the estimated 
cost of approved medical education programs (applicable to inpatient 
costs payable under Medicare Part A and for kidney acquisition costs in 
hospitals approved as renal transplantation centers) are determined by 
estimating the reimbursable amount for the year based on the previous 
year's experience and on substantiated information for the current year 
and divided into 26 equal biweekly payments. Each payment is made two 
weeks after the end of a biweekly period of services, as described in 
Sec. 413.64(h)(5) of this chapter. The interim payments are reviewed by 
the intermediary at least twice during the reporting period and adjusted 
if necessary.
    (d) Special interim payment for unusually long lengths of stay--(1) 
First interim payment. A hospital that is not receiving periodic interim 
payments under paragraph (b) of this section may request an interim 
payment after a Medicare beneficiary has been in the hospital at least 
60 days. Payment for the interim bill is determined as if the bill were 
a final discharge bill and includes any outlier payment determined as of 
the last day for which services have been billed.
    (2) Additional interim payments. A hospital may request additional 
interim payments at intervals of at least 60 days after the date of the 
first interim bill submitted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. 
Payment for these additional interim bills, as well as the final bill, 
is determined as if the bill were the final bill with appropriate 
adjustments made to the payment amount to reflect any previous interim 
payment made under the provisions of this paragraph (d).
    (e) Outlier payments. Payments for outlier cases (described in 
subpart F of this part) are not made on an interim basis. The outlier 
payments are made based on submitted bills and represent final payment.
    (f) Accelerated payments--(1) General rule. Upon request, an 
accelerated payment may be made to a hospital that is not receiving 
periodic interim payments under paragraph (b) of this section if the 
hospital is experiencing financial difficulties because of the 
following:
    (i) There is a delay by the intermediary in making payment to the 
hospital.
    (ii) Due to an exceptional situation, there is a temporary delay in 
the hospital's preparation and submittal of bills to the intermediary 
beyond its normal billing cycle.
    (2) Approval of payment. A hospital's request for an accelerated 
payment must be approved by the intermediary and HCFA.
    (3) Amount of payment. The amount of the accelerated payment is 
computed as a percentage of the net payment for unbilled or unpaid 
covered services.
    (4) Recovery of payment. Recovery of the accelerated payment is made 
by recoupment as hospital bills are processed or by direct payment by 
the hospital.

<R05>
Sec. 412.120  Reductions to total payments.

    (a) Deductible and coinsurance. Subject to paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, the total Medicare payments otherwise payable to a hospital are 
reduced by the applicable deductible and coinsurance amounts related to 
inpatient hospital services as determined in accordance with 
Secs. 409.82, 409.83, and 409.87 of this chapter.
    (b) Payment by workers' compensation, automobile medical, no-fault 
or liability insurance or an employer group health plan primary to 
Medicare. If workers' compensation, automobile medical, no-fault, or 
liability insurance or an employer group health plan which is primary to 
Medicare pays in full or in part, the Medicare payment is determined in 
accordance with the following guidelines:

[[Page 333]]

    (1) If workers' compensation pays, in accordance with the applicable 
provisions of Secs. 405.316 through 405.321 of this chapter.
    (2) If automobile medical, no-fault, or liability insurance pays, in 
accordance with the applicable provisions of Secs. 405.322 through 
405.325 of this chapter.
    (3) If an employer group health plan which is primary to Medicare 
pays for services to ESRD beneficiaries, in accordance with the

Sec. 412.125  Effect of change of ownership on payments under the prospective payment systems.

    When a hospital's ownership changes, as described in Sec. 489.18 of 
this chapter, the following rules apply:
    (a) Payment for the operating and capital-related costs of inpatient 
hospital services for each patient, including outlier payments, as 
provided in Sec. 412.112, and payments for hemophilia clotting factor 
costs under Sec. 412.115(b), are made to the entity that is the legal 
owner on the date of discharge. Payments are not prorated between the 
buyer and seller.
    (1) The owner on the date of discharge is entitled to submit a bill 
for all inpatient hospital services furnished to a beneficiary 
regardless of when the beneficiary's coverage began or ended during a 
stay, or of how long the stay lasted.
    (2) Each bill submitted must include all information necessary for 
the intermediary to compute the payment amount, whether or not some of 
that information is attributable to a period during which a different 
party legally owned the hospital.
    (b) Other payments under Sec. 412.113 and payments for bad debts as 
described in Sec. 412.115(a), are made to each owner or operator of the 
hospital (buyer and seller) in accordance with the principles of 
reasonable cost reimbursement.

Sec. 412.130  Retroactive adjustments for incorrectly excluded hospitals and units.

    (a) Hospitals for which adjustment is made. The intermediary makes 
the payment adjustment described in paragraph (b) of this section for 
the following hospitals:
    (1) A hospital that was excluded from the prospective payment system 
as a new rehabilitation hospital for a cost reporting period beginning 
on or after October 1, 1991 based on a certification under 
Sec. 412.23(b)(8) regarding the inpatient population the hospital 
planned to treat during that cost reporting period, if the inpatient 
population actually treated in the hospital during that cost reporting 
period did not meet the requirements of Sec. 412.23(b)(2).
    (2) A hospital that had a unit excluded from the prospective payment 
system as a new rehabilitation unit for a cost reporting period 
beginning on or after October 1, 1991 based on a certification under 
Sec. 412.30(a) regarding the inpatient population the hospital planned 
to treat in that unit during that period, if the inpatient population 
actually treated in the unit during that cost reporting period did not 
meet the requirements of Sec. 412.23(b)(2).
    (3) A hospital that added new beds to its existing rehabilitation 
unit for a cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1991 
based on a certification under Sec. 412.30(c) regarding the inpatient 
population the hospital planned to treat in these new beds during that 
cost reporting period, if the inpatient population actually treated in 
the new beds during that cost reporting period did not meet the 
requirements of Sec. 412.23(b)(2).
    (b) Adjustment of payment. The intermediary adjusts the payment to 
the hospitals described in paragraph (a) of this section as follows:
    (1) The intermediary calculates the difference between the amounts 
actually paid during the cost reporting period for which the hospital, 
unit, or

[[Page 334]]

beds were first excluded as a new hospital, new unit, or newly added 
beds, and the amount that would have been paid under the prospective 
payment systems for services furnished during that period.
    (2) The intermediary makes a retroactive adjustment for the 
difference between the amount paid to the hospital based on the 
exclusion and the amount that would have been paid under the prospective 
payment systems.

Sec. 412.200  General provisions.

    Beginning with discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1987, 
hospitals located in Puerto Rico are subject to the rules governing the 
prospective payment system for inpatient operating costs. Except as 
provided in this subpart, the provisions of subparts A, B, C, F, G, and 
H of this part apply to hospitals located in Puerto Rico. Except for 
Sec. 412.60, which deals with DRG classification and weighting factors, 
the provisions of subparts D and E, which describe the methodology used 
to determine prospective payment rates for inpatient operating costs for 
hospitals, do not apply to hospitals located in Puerto Rico. Instead, 
the methodology for determining prospective payment rates for inpatient 
operating costs for these hospitals is set forth in Secs. 412.204 
through 412.212.

<R05>
Sec. 412.204   Payment to hospitals located in Puerto Rico.

    (a) FY 1988 through FY 1997. For discharges occurring on or after 
October 1, 1997, payments for inpatient operating costs to hospitals 
located in Puerto Rico that are paid under the prospective payment 
system are equal to the sum of--
    (1) 75 percent of the Puerto Rico prospective payment rate for 
inpatient operating costs, as determined under Sec. 412.208 or 
Sec. 412.210; and
    (2) 25 percent of a national prospective payment rate for inpatient 
operating costs, as determined under Sec. 412.212.
    (b) FY 1998 and thereafter. For discharges occurring on or after 
October 1, 1997, payments for inpatient operating costs to hospitals 
located in Puerto Rico that are paid under the prospective payment 
system are equal to the sum of--
    (1) 50 percent of the Puerto Rico prospective payment rate for 
inpatient operating costs, as determined under Sec. 412.208 or 
Sec. 412.210; and
    (2) 50 percent of a national prospective payment rate for inpatient 
operating costs, as determined under Sec. 412.212.

<R05>
Sec. 412.208  Puerto Rico rates for Federal fiscal year 1988.

    (a) General rule. HCFA determines the Puerto Rico adjusted DRG 
prospective payment rate for inpatient operating costs for each 
inpatient hospital discharge occurring in Federal fiscal year 1988 for a 
prospective payment hospital. These rates are determined as described in 
paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section.
    (b) Determining target amounts. For each hospital subject to the 
prospective payment system for inpatient operating costs, HCFA 
determines the Medicare target amount, as described in Sec. 413.40(c) of 
this chapter, for the hospital's cost reporting period beginning in 
fiscal year 1987. Revisions in the target amounts made subsequent to 
establishment of the standardized amounts under paragraph (d) of this 
section do not affect the standardized amounts.
    (c) Updating the target amounts for fiscal year 1988. HCFA updates 
each target amount determined under paragraph (b) of this section for 
fiscal year 1988 by prorating the applicable percentage increase (as 
defined in Sec. 412.63(f) of this chapter) for fiscal year 1988 to the 
midpoint of fiscal year 1988 (April 1, 1988).
    (d) Standardizing amounts. HCFA standardizes the amount updated 
under

[[Page 335]]

paragraph (c) of this section for each hospital by--
    (1) Adjusting for variations in case mix among hospitals;
    (2) Excluding an estimate of indirect medical education costs;
    (3) Adjusting for area variations in hospital wage levels; and
    (4) Excluding an estimate of the payments for hospitals that serve a 
disproportionate share of low-income patients.
    (e) Computing urban and rural averages. HCFA computes separate 
discharge-weighted averages of the standardized amounts determined under 
paragraph (d) of this section for urban and rural hospitals in Puerto 
Rico.
    (f) Geographic classification. (1) For purposes of this paragraph 
(e) of this section, the following definitions apply:
    (i) The term urban area means a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), 
as defined by the Executive Office of Management and Budget.
    (ii) The term large urban area means an MSA with a population of 
more than 1,000,000.
    (iii) The term rural area means any area outside an urban area.
    (2) A hospital classified as rural is deemed to be urban and 
receives the urban Puerto Rico payment amount if the county in which it 
is located meets the following criteria:
    (i) At least 95 percent of the perimeter of the rural county is 
contiguous with urban counties.
    (ii) The county was reclassified from an urban area to a rural area 
after April 20, 1983, as described in Sec. 412.62(f)(1)(iv).
    (iii) At least 15 percent of employed workers in the county commute 
to the central county of one of the adjacent MSAs.
    (g) Reducing for value of outlier payments. HCFA reduces each of the 
average standardized amounts determined under paragraphs (c) through (e) 
of this section by a proportion equal to the proportion (estimated by 
HCFA) of the total amount of payments based on DRG prospective payment 
rates that are additional payments to hospitals located in Puerto Rico 
for outlier cases under subpart F of this part.
    (h) Computing Puerto Rico rates established under the prospective 
payment system for inpatient operating costs for urban and rural 
hospitals. For each discharge classified within a DRG, HCFA establishes 
a Puerto Rico prospective payment rate, as follows:
    (1) For hospitals located in an urban area, the rate equals the 
product of--
    (i) The average standardized amount (computed under paragraphs (c) 
through (g) of this section) for hospitals located in an urban area; and
    (ii) The weighting factor determined under Sec. 412.60(b) for that 
DRG.
    (2) For hospitals located in a rural area, the rate equals the 
product of--
    (i) The average standardized amount (computed under paragraphs (c) 
through (g) of this section) for hospitals located in a rural area; and
    (ii) The weighting factor determined under Sec. 412.60(b) for that 
DRG.
    (i) Adjusting for different area wage levels. HCFA adjusts the 
proportion (as estimated by HCFA from time to time) of Puerto Rico rates 
computed under paragraph (h) of this section that are attributable to 
wages and labor-related costs, for area differences in hospital wage 
levels, by a factor (established by HCFA) reflecting the relative 
hospital wage level in the geographic area (that is, urban or rural area 
as determined under the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section) of 
the hospital compared to the national average hospital wage level.

<R05>
Sec. 412.210  Puerto Rico rates for fiscal years after Federal fiscal year 1988.

    (a) General rule. (1) HCFA determines the Puerto Rico adjusted 
prospective payment rate for inpatient operating costs for each 
inpatient hospital discharge occurring in a Federal fiscal year after 
fiscal year 1988 that involves inpatient hospital services of a hospital 
in Puerto Rico subject to the prospective payment system for which 
payment may be made under Medicare Part A.
    (2) The rate is determined for hospitals located in large urban, 
other urban, or rural areas within Puerto

[[Page 336]]

Rico, as described in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.
    (b) Geographic classifications. (1) For purposes of this section, 
the definitions set forth in Sec. 412.208(f)(1) apply.
    (2) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1988, a hospital 
located in a rural county adjacent to one or more urban areas is deemed 
to be located in an urban area and receives the Federal payment amount 
for the urban area to which the greatest number of workers in the county 
commute if the rural county would otherwise be considered part of an 
urban area, under the standards for designating MSAs if the commuting 
rates used in determining outlying counties were determined on the basis 
of the aggregate number of resident workers who commute to (and, if 
applicable under the standards, from) the central county or central 
counties of all adjacent MSAs.

These EOMB standards are set forth in the notice of final standards for 
classification of MSAs published in the Federal Register on January 3, 
1980 (45 FR 956), and available from HCFA, East High Rise Building, Room 
132, 6325 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, Maryland 21207.
    (3) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1988, for 
hospitals that consist of two or more separately located inpatient 
hospital facilities, the national adjusted prospective payment rate for 
inpatient operating costs is based on the geographic location of the 
hospital at which the discharge occurs.
    (c) Updating previous standardized amounts. HCFA computes separate 
average standardized amounts for hospitals in large urban, other urban, 
and rural areas within Puerto Rico equal to the respective average 
standardized amount computed for fiscal year 1988 under 
Sec. 412.208(e)--
    (1) Increased by the applicable percentage changes determined under 
Sec. 412.63 (g) and (h); and
    (2) Reduced by a proportion equal to the proportion (estimated by 
HCFA) of the total amount of prospective payments that are additional 
payment amounts to hospitals located in Puerto Rico attributable to 
outlier cases under subpart F of this part.
    (d) Computing Puerto Rico rates for large urban, other urban, and 
rural hospitals. For each discharge classified within a DRG, HCFA 
establishes for the fiscal year a Puerto Rico prospective payment rate 
for inpatient operating costs as follows:
    (1) For hospitals located in a large urban or other urban area in 
Puerto Rico, the rate equals the product of--
    (i) The average standardized amount (computed under paragraph (c) of 
this section) for the fiscal year for hospitals located in a large urban 
or other urban area; and
    (ii) The weighting factor determined under Sec. 412.60(b) for that 
DRG.
    (2) For hospitals located in a rural area in Puerto Rico, the rate 
equals the product of--
    (i) The average standardized amount (computed under paragraph (c) of 
this section) for the fiscal year for hospitals located in a rural area; 
and
    (ii) The weighting factor (determined under Sec. 412.60(b)) for that 
DRG.
    (e) Adjusting for different area wage levels. HCFA adjusts the 
proportion (as estimated by HCFA from time to time) of Puerto Rico rates 
computed under paragraph (d) of this section that is attributable to 
wages and labor-related costs for area differences in hospital wage 
levels by a factor (established by HCFA) reflecting the relative 
hospital wage level in the geographic area (that is, urban or rural area 
as determined under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section) of 
the hospital compared to the Peurto Rico average hospital wage level.

Sec. 412.212  National rate.

    (a) General rule. For purposes of payment to hospitals located in 
Puerto Rico, the national prospective payment rate for inpatient 
operating costs is determined as described in paragraphs (b) through (d) 
of this section.
    (b) Computing a national average standardized amount. HCFA computes 
a discharge-weighted average of the--
    (1) National urban adjusted standardized amount determined under 
Sec. 412.63(j)(1)(i); and
    (2) National rural adjusted average standardized amount determined 
under Sec. 412.63(j)(2)(i).

[[Page 337]]

    (c) Computing a national rate. For each discharge classified within 
a DRG, the national rate equals the product of--
    (1) The national average standardized amount computed under 
paragraph (b) of this section; and
    (2) The weighting factor (determined under Sec. 412.60(b)) for that 
DRG.
    (d) Adjusting for different area wage levels. HCFA adjusts the 
proportion (as estimated by HCFA from time to time) of the national rate 
computed under paragraph (c) of this section that is attributable to 
wages and labor-related costs for area differences in hospital wage 
levels by a factor (established by HCFA) reflecting the relative 
hospital wage level in the geographic area of the hospital compared to 
the national average hospital wage level.

                Criteria and Conditions for Redesignation


<R05>
Sec. 412.230  Criteria for an individual hospital seeking redesignation to another rural area or an urban area.

    (a) General. (1) Purpose. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of 
this section, an individual hospital may be redesignated from a rural 
area to an urban area, from a rural area to another rural area, or from 
an urban area to another urban area for the purposes of using the other 
area's standardized amount for inpatient operating costs, wage index 
value, or both.
    (2) Proximity. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, to be redesignated to another rural area or an urban area, a 
hospital must demonstrate a close proximity to the area to which it 
seeks redesignation by meeting the criteria in paragraph (b) of this 
section, and submitting data requested under paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (3) Special rules for sole community hospitals and rural referral 
centers. To be redesignated under the special rules in this paragraph, a 
hospital must be a sole community hospital or a rural referral center as 
of the date of the MGCRB's review.
    (i) A hospital that is a rural referral center, a sole community 
hospital, or both does not have to demonstrate a close proximity to the 
area to which it seeks redesignation.
    (ii) If a hospital that is a rural referral center, a sole community 
hospital, or both qualifies for urban redesignation, it is redesignated 
to the urban area that is closest to the hospital. If the hospital is 
closer to another rural area than to any urban area, it may seek 
redesignation to either the closest rural or the closest urban area.
    (iii) If a sole community hospital or rural referral center loses 
its special status as a result of redesignation, the hospital is 
considered to retain its special status for the purpose of applicability 
of the special rules in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
    (iv) A hospital that is redesignated under paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section may not be redesignated in the same fiscal year under paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section.
    (4) Application of criteria. In applying the numeric criteria 
contained in Secs. 412.230(b)(1) and (2), (d)(2), (e)(1)(iii), and 
(e)(l)(iv) (A) and (B), rounding of numbers to meet the mileage or 
qualifying percentage standard is not permitted.
    (5) Limitations on redesignation. The following limitations apply to 
redesignation:

[[Page 338]]

    (i) An individual hospital may not be redesignated to another area 
for purposes of the wage index if the pre-reclassified average hourly 
wage for that area is lower than the pre-reclassified average hourly 
wage for the area in which the hospital is located.
    (ii) For redesignations effective in fiscal years 1997 and 1998 and 
2002 and thereafter, a hospital may not be redesignated for purposes of 
the standardized amount if the area to which the hospital seeks 
redesignation does not have a higher standardized amount than the 
standardized amount the hospital currently receives.
    (iii) A hospital may not be redesignated to more than one area.
    (b) Proximity criteria. A hospital demonstrates a close proximity 
with the area to which it seeks redesignation if one of the following 
conditions applies:
    (1) The distance from the hospital to the area is no more than 15 
miles for an urban hospital and no more than 35 miles for a rural 
hospital.
    (2) At least 50 percent of the hospital's employees reside in the 
area.
    (c) Appropriate proximity data. For redesignation to an area, the 
hospital must submit appropriate data relating to its proximity to that 
area.
    (1) To demonstrate proximity to the area, the hospital must submit 
evidence of the shortest route over improved roads to the area and the 
distance of that route.
    (2) For employee address data, the hospital must submit current 
payroll records that include information that establishes the home 
addresses by zip code of its employees.
    (d) Use of an area's standardized amount for inpatient operating 
costs. (1) Criteria. To receive an area's standardized amount for 
inpatient operating costs, a hospital must demonstrate that its incurred 
costs are more comparable to the amount it would be paid if it were 
reclassified than the amount it would be paid under its current 
classification, and that it has the necessary geographic relationship 
(as specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section) with the area 
to which it seeks redesignation.
    (2) Demonstrating comparable costs. A hospital demonstrates that its 
costs are more comparable to the amount it would be paid if it were 
reclassified if the hospital's case mix adjusted cost per discharge is 
at least equal to its current rate plus 75 percent of the difference 
between that rate and the rate it would receive if it were reclassified.
    (3) Appropriate cost data. For a standardized amount for inpatient 
operating costs change, the hospital must submit appropriate data as 
follows:
    (i) For hospital-specific data, the hospital must provide data from 
its most recently settled and most recently filed cost report.
    (ii) For data on other hospitals, the hospital must base its 
application on the most recent revisions to the prospective payment 
rates for inpatient operating costs, as published in the Federal 
Register.
    (e) Use of urban or other rural area's wage index.--(1) Criteria for 
use of area's wage index. Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(3) and 
(e)(4) of this section, to use an area's wage index, a hospital must 
demonstrate the following:
    (i) The hospital's incurred wage costs are comparable to hospital 
wage costs in an urban or other rural area;
    (ii) The hospital has the necessary geographic relationship as 
specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section;
    (iii) The hospital's average hourly wage is at least 108 percent of 
the average hourly wage of hospitals in the area in which the hospital 
is located; and
    (iv) One of the following conditions apply:
    (A) The hospital's average hourly wage is equal to at least 84 
percent of the average hourly wage of hospitals in the area to which it 
seeks redesignation; or
    (B) For redesignations effective before fiscal year 1999, the 
hospital's average hourly wage weighted for occupational categories is 
at least 90 percent of the average hourly wages of hospitals in the area 
to which it seeks redesignation.
    (2) Appropriate wage data. For a wage index change, the hospital 
must submit appropriate data as follows:
    (i) For hospital-specific data, the hospital must provide data from 
the HCFA hospital wage survey used to construct the wage index in effect 
for prospective payment purposes during

[[Page 339]]

the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year for which the hospital requests 
reclassification.
    (ii) For data of other hospitals, the hospital must provide data 
concerning the following:
    (A) The average hourly wage in the area in which the hospital is 
located and the average hourly wage in the area to which the hospital 
seeks reclassification. The wage data are taken from the HCFA hospital 
wage survey used to construct the wage index in effect for prospective 
payment purposes during the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year for 
which the hospital requests reclassification and;
    (B) If the hospital is requesting reclassification under 
Sec. 412.230(e)(1)(iv)(B), occupational-mix data to demonstrate the 
average occupational mix for each employment category in the area to 
which the hospital seeks reclassification. Occupational-mix data can be 
obtained from surveys conducted by the American Hospital Association.
    (3) Rural referral center exception. If a hospital is a rural 
referral center, it does not have to demonstrate that it meets the 
criterion set forth in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section concerning 
its average hourly wage.
    (4) Special dominating hospital exception. The requirements of 
paragraph (e)(1)(i) and (e)(1)(iii) of this section do not apply if a 
hospital meets the following criteria:
    (i) Its average hourly wage is at least 108 percent of the average 
hourly wage of all other hospitals in the area in which the hospital is 
located.
    (ii) It pays at least 40 percent of the adjusted uninflated wages in 
the MSA.
    (iii) It was approved for redesignation under this paragraph (e) for 
each year from fiscal year 1992 through fiscal year 1997.

paragraph (c) of this section.
    (4) The hospitals may be redesignated only if one of the following 
conditions is met:
    (i) The pre-reclassified average hourly wage for the area to which 
they seek redesignation is higher than the pre-reclassified average 
hourly wage for the area in which they are currently located.
    (ii) The standardized amount for the area to which they seek 
redesignation is higher than the standardized amount for the area in 
which they are located.
    (b) Metropolitan character. The group of hospitals must demonstrate 
that the county in which the hospitals are located meets the standards 
for redesignation to an MSA or an NECMA as an outlying county that were 
published in the Federal Register on March 30, 1990 (55 FR 12154) using 
Bureau of the Census data or Bureau of Census estimates made after 1990.
    (c) Wage criteria. In applying the following numeric criteria, 
rounding of numbers to meet the qualifying percentages is not permitted.
    (1) Aggregate hourly wage. The aggregate average hourly wage for all 
hospitals in the rural county must be equal to at least 85 percent of 
the average hourly wage in the adjacent urban area; or
    (2) Aggregate hourly wage weighted for occupational mix. For 
redesignations effective before fiscal year 1999, the aggregate hourly 
wage for all hospitals in the rural county, weighted for occupational 
categories, is at least 90 percent of the average hourly wage in the 
adjacent urban area.
    (d) Appropriate data. (1) Metropolitan character. (i) To meet the 
criteria in

[[Page 340]]

paragraph (b) of this section, the hospitals may submit data, estimates, 
or projections, made by the Bureau of the Census concerning population 
density or growth, or changes in designation of urban areas.
    (ii) The MGCRB only considers data developed by the Bureau of the 
Census.
    (2) Appropriate wage data. The hospitals must submit appropriate 
data as follows:
    (i) For hospital-specific data, the hospitals must provide data from 
the HCFA wage survey used to construct the wage index in effect for 
prospective payment purposes during the fiscal year prior to the fiscal 
year for which the hospitals request reclassification.
    (ii) For data for other hospitals, the hospitals must provide the 
following:
    (A) The average hourly wage in the adjacent area, which is taken 
from the HCFA hospital wage survey used to construct the wage index in 
effect for prospective payment purposes during the fiscal year prior to 
the fiscal year for which the hospitals request reclassification.
    (B) Occupational-mix data to demonstrate the average occupational 
mix for each employment category in the adjacent area. Occupational-mix 
data can be obtained from surveys conducted by the American Hospital 
Association.

conditions must be met:
    (1) All hospitals in an urban county must apply for redesignation as 
a group.
    (2) The county in which the hospitals are located must be adjacent 
to the urban area to which they seek redesignation.
    (3) The county in which the hospitals are located must be part of 
the Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) that includes the 
urban area to which they seek redesignation.
    (4) The hospitals may be redesignated only if one of the following 
conditions is met.
    (i) The pre-reclassified average hourly wage for the area to which 
they seek redesignation is higher than the pre-reclassified average 
hourly wage for the area in which they are currently located.
    (ii) The standardized amount for the area to which they seek 
redesignation is higher than the standardized amount for the area in 
which they are currently located.
    (b) Wage criteria. In applying the following numeric criteria, 
rounding of numbers to meet the qualifying percentages is not permitted.
    (1) Aggregate hourly wage. The aggregate average hourly wage of all 
hospitals in the urban county must be at least 85 percent of the average 
hospital hourly wage in the MSA or NECMA to which the hospitals in the 
county seek reclassification; or
    (2) Aggregate hourly wage weighted for occupational mix. For 
redesignations effective before fiscal year 1999, the aggregate average 
hourly wage for all hospitals in the county, weighted for occupational 
categories, is at least 90 percent of the average hourly wage in the 
adjacent urban area.
    (c) Standardized amount inpatient operating costs. (1) Criteria. The

that their costs are more comparable to the average amount they would be 
paid if they were reclassified if, on average, each hospital's case-mix 
adjusted cost per case is at least equal to the amount it would be paid 
under its current classification plus 75 percent of the difference 
between that amount and the amount the hospital would receive if it were 
reclassified.
    (d) Appropriate data. (1) Wage data. The hospitals must submit 
appropriate wage data as provided for in Sec. 412.230(e)(2).

    (3) Within 15 days of the receipt of the Administrator's notice of 
review, the hospital may submit a response in writing to the 
Administrator, with a copy of HCFA.
    (d) Criteria for discretionary review. In deciding whether to review 
an MGCRB decision, the Administrator normally considers whether it 
appears that any of the following situations apply:
    (1) The MGCRB made an erroneous interpretation of law, regulation, 
or HCFA Ruling.
    (2) The MGCRB's decision is not supported by substantial evidence.
    (3) The case presents a significant policy issue having a basis in 
law and regulations, and review is likely to lead to issuance of a HCFA 
Ruling or other directive needed to clarify a provision in the law or 
regulations.
    (4) The decision of the MGCRB requires clarification, amplication, 
or an alternative legal basis.
    (5) The MGCRB has incorrectly extended its authority to a degree not 
provided for by law, regulation, or HCFA Ruling.
    (e) Communication procedures. All communications between HCFA staff 
and the Administrator concerning the Administrator's review of an MGCRB 
decision must be in writing. As specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
this section, copies of comments by HCFA staff are sent to applicant 
hospitals within 15 days of receipt of a hospital's request for review, 
or, in cases in which the Administrator decides to review a case at his 
or her discretion, are included with the Administrator's notice of 
review. In the event there are additional communications between HCFA 
staff and the Administrator concerning MGCRB decisions reviewed by the 
Administrator under paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section, HCFA 
furnishes copies of the communications to the hospital or group of 
hospitals.

[[Page 346]]

    (2) The Administrator issues a decision in writing to the party with 
a copy to HCFA--
    (i) Not later than 90 days following receipt of the party's request 
for review; or
    (ii) Not later than 105 days following issuance of the MGCRB 
decision in the case of review at the discretion of the Administrator.
    (3) The Administrator's decision issued under Sec. 412.278 (a) or

computational errors, or to correct the decision if the evidence that 
was considered in making the decision clearly shows on its face that an 
error was made. The following procedure is followed:
    (i) The hospital's request for amendment must be received by the 
Administrator within 10 days after the date the Administrator issues a 
decision. The request for amendment must be in writing, with a copy to 
HCFA.
    (ii) The Administrator promptly reviews the hospital's request and 
amends the decision, if necessary, within 5 days following receipt of 
the hospital's request for amendment.
    (2) Discretionary review by the Administrator. Within 15 days 
following the issuance of the Administrator's decision, the 
Administrator, at his or her discretion, may amend the decision to 
correct mathematical or computational errors, or to correct the decision 
if the evidence that was considered in making the decision clearly shows 
on its face that an error was made. The Administrator's amended decision

Sec. 412.300  Scope of subpart and definition.

    (a) Purpose. This subpart implements section 1886(g)(1)(A) of the 
Act by establishing a prospective payment system for inpatient hospital 
capital-related costs. Under this system, payment is made on the basis 
described in Sec. 412.304 through Sec. 412.374 for inpatient hospital 
capital-related costs furnished by hospitals subject to the prospective 
payment system under subpart B of this part.
    (b) Definition. For purposes of this subpart, a new hospital means a 
hospital that has operated (under previous or present ownership) for 
less than 2 years. The following hospitals are not new hospitals:
    (1) A hospital that builds new or replacement facilities at the same 
or another location even if coincidental

[[Page 347]]

with a change of ownership, a change in management, or a lease 
arrangement.
    (2) A hospital that closes and subsequently reopens.
    (3) A hospital that has been in operation for more than 2 years but 
has participated in the Medicare program for less than 2 years.
    (4) A hospital that changes its status from a hospital that is 
excluded from the prospective payment systems to a hospital that is 
subject to the capital prospective payment systems.

Sec. 412.302  Introduction to capital costs.

    (a) New capital costs. New capital costs are allowable Medicare 
inpatient hospital capital-related costs under subpart G of part 413 of 
this chapter that are related to assets that were first put in use for 
patient care after December 31, 1990 (except for such costs deemed to be 
old capital costs based on prior obligations as described in paragraph 
(c) of this section) and those allowable capital-related costs related 
to assets in use prior to December 31, 1990 that are excluded from the 
definition of old capital costs described in paragraphs (b) (2) through 
(5) of this section, or are betterment or improvement costs related to 
those old capital assets.
    (b) Old capital costs. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section with respect to capital obligations that qualify for recognition 
as old capital, old capital costs are allowable capital-related costs 
for land and depreciable assets that were put in use for patient care on 
or before December 31, 1990. However, for a new hospital as defined in 
Sec. 412.300(b), old capital costs are defined as those allowable 
capital-related costs for land and depreciable assets that were put in 
use for patient care on or before the later of December 31, 1990 or the 
last day of the hospital's base year cost reporting period under 
Sec. 412.328(a)(2). Old capital costs include the following:
    (1) Allowable depreciation on assets based on the useful life 
guidelines used to determine depreciation expense in the hospital's base 
period.
    (2) Allowable capital-related interest expense. Except as provided 
below, the amount of allowable capital-related interest expense that 
will be recognized as old capital is limited to the amount the hospital 
was legally obligated to pay as of December 31, 1990. Any allowable 
interest expense in excess of this limitation will be recognized as new 
capital.
    (i) An increase in interest expense is recognized if the increase is 
due to periodic fluctuations of rates in variable interest rate loans or 
at the time of conversion from a variable rate loan to a fixed rate loan 
when no other changes in the terms of the loan are made.
    (ii) If the terms of a debt instrument are revised after December 
31, 1990, the amount of interest that will be recognized as old capital 
during the transition cannot exceed the amount that would have been 
recognized during the same period prior to the revision of the debt 
instrument.
    (iii) If short-term financing was used to acquire old capital assets 
and the debt is extended or ``rolled-over'', a portion of the extended 
debt will be recognized as old capital. The portion will equal the ratio 
of the net book value as of the beginning of the applicable cost 
reporting period for depreciable assets that were in use in the base 
year, to the net book value as of the beginning of the base year cost 
reporting period for those assets. The net book value for the base year 
will not be adjusted to exclude assets that have been fully depreciated 
or removed from service since the base year. If the debt is related to 
specific assets, the ratio will be determined based on the values for 
those assets. The ratio will exclude assets that were acquired with 
other identifiable debt instruments. For purposes of this paragraph, 
short term financing is a debt that becomes due in no later than the 
earlier of 5 years or half of the average useful life of the assets to 
which the debt is related.
    (iv) If old capital indebtedness is commingled with new capital 
debt, the allowable interest expense will be apportioned to old capital 
costs based on the ratio of the portion of the loan principal related to 
old capital indebtedness to the total loan principal.

[[Page 348]]

    (v) Investment income, excluding income from funded depreciation 
accounts, is used to reduce old capital interest expense based on the 
ratio of total old capital interest expense to total allowable interest 
expense in each cost reporting period.
    (3) Allowable capital-related lease and rental costs for land and 
depreciable assets that were obligated as of December 31, 1990.
    (i) Lease renewals up to the annual lease payment level obligated as 
of December 31, 1990 are recognized provided the same asset remains in 
use, the asset has a useful life of at least 3 years, and the annual 
lease payment is $1,000 or more for each item or service.
    (ii) If a hospital-owned asset is sold or given to another party and 
that same asset is then leased back by the hospital, the amount of 
allowable capital-related costs recognized as old capital costs is 
limited to the amount allowed for that asset in the last cost reporting 
period that it was owned by the hospital.
    (iii) If an entire hospital is leased without assumption of the 
hospital's asset costs after December 31, 1990, the amount of allowable 
capital-related costs recognized as old capital costs is limited to the 
amount allowed for old capital costs in the base year or the last cost 
reporting period these costs were recognized under this subpart, 
whichever is later.
    (4) The portion of allowable costs for other capital-related 
expenses (including but not limited to, taxes, insurance, license and 
royalty fees on depreciable assets) resulting from applying the ratio of 
the hospital's gross old asset value to total asset value in each cost 
reporting period.
    (5) The appropriate portion of the capital-related costs of related 
organizations under Sec. 413.17 that would be recognized as old capital 
costs if these costs had been incurred directly by the hospital.
    (6) Obligated capital costs that are recognized as old capital costs 
in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
    (7) If a hospital had nonreimbursable costs applicable to an old 
capital asset as of December 31, 1990 that subsequently become allowable 
inpatient capital-related costs, the allowable costs for such an asset 
that are attributable to inpatient hospital services are recognized as 
old capital costs if a portion of the asset was in use for inpatient 
hospital care on December 31, 1990 and the costs meet all other 
provisions for recognition of old capital costs contained in this 
section.
    (c) Obligated capital costs--(1) General rule. Under the conditions 
described below, capital-related costs attributable to assets that are 
put in use after December 31, 1990 may be recognized as old capital 
costs. Any allowable capital-related costs for these assets that are not 
recognized as old capital costs are recognized as new capital costs.
    (i) Fixed assets. The costs of capital-related items and services 
defined in subpart G of part 413 for which there was a contractual 
obligation entered into by a hospital or related party with an outside, 
unrelated party for the construction, reconstruction, lease, rental, or 
financing of a fixed asset may be recognized as old capital costs if all 
the following conditions are met:
    (A) The obligation must arise from a binding written agreement that 
was executed on or before December 31, 1990 and that obligates the 
hospital on or before December 31, 1990.
    (B) The capital asset must be put in use for patient care before 
October 1, 1994 except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this 
section.
    (C) The hospital notifies the intermediary of the existence of 
obligated capital costs as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this 
section.
    (D) The amount that is recognized as old capital cost is limited to 
the lesser of the actual allowable costs when the asset is put in use or 
the estimated costs of the capital expenditure at the time it was 
obligated as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(vi) of this section.
    (ii) Moveable equipment. Moveable equipment is recognized as old 
capital only if all of the conditions specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) 
(B) through (D) of this section are met and one of the following 
conditions is met:
    (A) There was a binding contractual agreement that was executed on 
or before December 31, 1990 and obligates the hospital on or before 
December 31,

[[Page 349]]

1990 for the lease or purchase of the item of equipment on or before 
December 31, 1990.
    (B) There was a binding contractual agreement that was executed on 
or before December 31, 1990 and obligates the hospital on or before 
December 31, 1990 for financing the acquisition of the equipment; the 
item of equipment costs at least $100,000; and the item was specifically 
listed in an equipment purchase plan approved by the Board of Directors 
on or before December 31, 1990.
    (iii) Agreements not recognized. Agreements for planning, design or 
feasibility that do not commit the hospital to undertake a project are 
not recognized as obligating capital expenditures for purposes of this 
subsection.
    (iv) Extension of deadline. HCFA may extend the deadline in 
paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section, under which an asset must be put 
in use for patient care before October 1, 1994, to no later than 
September 30, 1996 for extraordinary circumstances beyond the hospital's 
control. Extraordinary circumstances include, but are not limited to, a 
construction strike or atypically severe weather that significantly 
delayed completion of a construction project. Normal construction delays 
do not constitute extraordinary circumstances.
    (A) The hospital must submit its request for an extended deadline 
with documentation of the extraordinary circumstances by the later of 
January 1, 1993 or 180 days after the extraordinary circumstance.
    (B) The intermediary reviews the request and verifies the hospital's 
documentation, and forwards the request to HCFA within 60 days. Within 
90 days, HCFA notifies the intermediary of its decision and, if an 
extension is granted, of the revised deadline for putting the asset in 
use for patient care service.
    (v) The hospital must submit to its intermediary the binding 
agreement and supporting documents that relate to the obligated capital 
expenditure by the later of October 1, 1992, or within 90 days after the 
start of the hospital's first cost reporting period beginning on or 
after October 1, 1991. This documentation must include a project 
description (including details of any phased construction or financing) 
and an estimate of costs that were prepared no later than December 31, 
1990.
    (vi) Cost limitation--(A) Leases, Rentals or Purchases. The amount 
of obligated capital costs recognized as old capital costs cannot exceed 
the amount specified in the lease, rental, or purchase agreement. If 
moveable equipment is recognized as old capital under paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, the amount recognized as old capital 
costs cannot exceed the estimated cost identified in the equipment 
purchase plan approved by the hospital's Board of Directors.
    (B) Construction contracts. The amount of obligated capital costs 
recognized as old capital costs cannot exceed the estimated construction 
costs for the project as of December 31, 1990. Additional costs will be 
recognized as old capital costs only if the additional costs are 
directly attributable to changes in life safety codes or other building 
requirements established by government ordinance that occurred after the 
project was obligated.
    (C) Financing costs. The amount of obligated interest expense that 
will be recognized as old capital costs cannot exceed the amount for 
which the hospital was legally obligated as of December 31, 1990 or, in 
the case of financing that is arranged after December 31, 1990 for a 
capital acquisition that was legally obligated as of December 31, 1990, 
the amount specified in a detailed financing plan approved by the 
hospital's Board of Directors prior to January 1, 1991.
    (vii) Determining old capital costs. (A) The intermediary determines 
whether the applicable criteria are met for recognition of obligated 
capital costs as old capital costs and the maximum allowable cost that 
will be recognized as old capital costs.
    (B) The intermediary advises the hospital of its determination by 
the later of the end of the hospital's first cost reporting period 
subject to the capital prospective payment system or 9 months after the 
receipt of the hospital's notification under paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this 
section.
    (C) The actual amount that will be recognized as old capital costs 
is based on the lesser of the allowable costs for

[[Page 350]]

the asset when it is put into patient use or the amounts determined 
under paragraph (c)(1)(vi) of this section.
    (viii) Multi-phase project. If the hospital has a multi-phase 
capital project, the provisions of paragraphs (c)(1) (i) through (vii) 
of this section apply independently to each phase of the project.
    (2) Lengthy certificate-of-need process. (i) If a hospital does not 
meet the criteria under paragraph (c)(1)(i) or paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of 
this section, but meets all of the following criteria, the estimated 
cost for the project as of December 31, 1990 may be recognized as old 
capital costs:
    (A) The hospital is required under State law to obtain preapproval 
of the capital project or acquisition by a designated State or local 
planning authority in the State in which it is located.
    (B) The hospital filed an initial application for a certificate of 
need on or before December 31, 1989 that includes a detailed description 
of the project and its estimated cost and had not received approval or 
disapproval on or before September 30, 1990. If the hospital received 
conditional approval on or before September 30, 1990, the hospital's 
intermediary assesses the nature of the conditions. The hospital will be 
considered to have received approval for the project as of September 30, 
1990 if the intermediary determines that the hospital received 
sufficient approval for the project to proceed without significant 
delay.
    (C) The hospital expended the lesser of $750,000 or 10 percent of 
the estimated cost of the project on or before December 31, 1990; and
    (D) The hospital put the asset into patient use on or before the 
later of September 30, 1996 or 4 years from the date the certificate of 
need was approved.
    (ii) The provisions of paragraphs (c)(1) (iv) through (viii) of this 
section apply to projects that meet the criteria in paragraph (c)(2)(i) 
of this section.
    (3) Construction in process. (i) If a hospital that initiates 
construction on a capital project does not meet the requirements of 
paragraphs (c)(1)(i) or (ii) or (c)(2)(i) of this section, the project 
costs may be recognized as old capital costs if all the following 
conditions are met:
    (A) The hospital received any required certificate of need approval 
on or before December 31, 1990.
    (B) The hospital's Board of Directors formally authorized the 
project with a detailed description of its scope and costs on or before 
December 31, 1990.
    (C) The estimated cost of the project as of December 31, 1990 
exceeds 5 percent of the hospital's total patient revenues during its 
base year.
    (D) The capitalized cost that had been incurred for the project as 
of December 31, 1990 exceeded the lesser of $750,000 or 10 percent of 
the estimated project cost.
    (E) The hospital began actual construction or renovation 
(``groundbreaking'') on or before March 31, 1991.
    (F) The project is completed before October 1, 1994.
    (ii) The provisions of paragraphs (c)(1) (iv) through (viii) of this 
section apply to projects that meet the criteria in paragraph (c)(3)(i) 
of this section.
    (d) Consistency in cost reporting--(1) General rule. For cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991, and before 
October 1, 2001, the hospital must follow consistent cost finding 
methods for classifying and allocating capital-related costs, except as 
otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
    (2) Old capital costs. Unless there is a change of ownership, the 
hospital must continue the same cost finding methods for old capital 
costs, including its practices for the direct assignment of capital-
related costs and its cost allocation bases, that were in effect in the 
hospital's last cost reporting period ending on or before October 1, 
1991. If there is a change of ownership, the new owners may request that 
the intermediary approve a change in order to be consistent with their 
established cost finding practices.
    (3) New capital costs. If a hospital desires to change its cost 
finding methods for new capital costs, the request for change must be 
made in writing to the intermediary prior to the beginning of the cost 
reporting period for which the change is to apply. The request must 
include justification as to

[[Page 351]]

why the change will result in more accurate and more appropriate cost 
finding. The intermediary will not approve the change unless it 
determines that there is reasonable justification for the change.
    (4) Hospitals may elect the simplified cost allocation methodology 
under the terms and conditions provided in the instructions for HCFA 
Form 2552.

Sec. 412.304  Implementation of the capital prospective payment system.

    (a) General rule. As described in Secs. 412.312 through 412.370, 
effective with cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 
1991, HCFA pays an amount determined under the capital prospective 
payment system for each inpatient hospital discharge as defined in 
Sec. 412.4. This amount is in addition to the amount payable under the 
prospective payment system for inpatient hospital operating costs as 
determined under Sec. 412.63.
    (b) Cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991 and 
before October 1, 2001. For cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 1991 and before October 1, 2001, the capital payment amount 
is based on either a combination of payments for old capital costs and 
new capital costs or a fully prospective rate, as determined under 
Sec. 412.324 through Sec. 412.348.
    (c) Cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2001. 
For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2001, the 
capital payment amount is based solely on the Federal rate determined 
under paragraphs (a) and (b) of Sec. 412.308 and updated under paragraph 
(c) of Sec. 412.308.
    (d) Interim payments. Interim payments are made to the hospital as 
provided in Sec. 412.116.

 Basic Methodology for Determining the Federal Rate for Capital-Related 
                                  Costs


<R05>
Sec. 412.308  Determining and updating the Federal rate.

    (a) FY 1992 national average cost per discharge. HCFA determines the 
FY 1992 estimated national average cost per discharge by updating the 
discharge weighted national average Medicare inpatient hospital capital-
related cost per discharge for FY 1989 by the estimated increase in 
Medicare inpatient hospital capital costs per discharge.
    (b) Standard Federal rate. The standard Federal rate is used to 
determine the Federal rate for each fiscal year in accordance with the 
formula specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (1) HCFA determines the standard Federal rate by adjusting the FY 
1992 updated national average cost per discharge by a factor so that 
estimated aggregate payments based on the standard Federal rate adjusted 
by the payment adjustments described in Sec. 412.312(b) equal estimated 
aggregate payments based solely on the national average cost per 
discharge.
    (2) Effective FY 1994, the standard Federal rate used to determine 
the Federal rate each year under paragraph (c) of this section is 
reduced by 7.4 percent.
    (3) Effective FY 1996, the standard Federal rate used to determine 
the Federal rate each year under paragraph (c) of this section is 
reduced by 0.28 percent to account for the effect of the revised policy 
for payment of transfers under Sec. 412.4(d).
    (4) Effective FY 1998, the unadjusted standard Federal capital 
payment rate in effect on September 30, 1997, used to determine the 
Federal rate each year under paragraph (c) of this section is reduced by 
15.68 percent.
    (5) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997 through 
September 30, 2002, the unadjusted standard

[[Page 352]]

Federal capital payment rate as in effect on September 30, 1997, used to 
determine the Federal rate each year under paragraph (c) of this section 
is further reduced by 2.1 percent.
    (c) The Federal rate. HCFA determines the Federal rate each year by 
adjusting the standard Federal rate by the following factors.
    (1) Update factor. After FY 1992, HCFA updates the standard Federal 
rate as follows:
    (i) FY 1993 through FY 1995. For FY 1993 through FY 1995, the 
standard Federal rate is updated based on a moving two-year average of 
actual increases in capital-related costs per discharge for the period 
three and four years before the fiscal year in question, excluding the 
portion of the increase attributable to changes in case mix.
    (ii) Effective FY 1996. Effective FY 1996, the standard Federal rate 
is updated based on an analytical framework. The framework includes a 
capital input price index, which measures the annual change in the 
prices associated with capital-related costs during the year. HCFA 
adjusts the capital input price index rate of change to take into 
account forecast errors, changes in the case mix index, the effect of 
changes to DRG classification and relative weights, and allowable 
changes in the intensity of hospital services.
    (2) Outlier payment adjustment factor. HCFA reduces the updated 
standard Federal rate by an adjustment factor equal to the estimated 
additional payments under the Federal rate for outlier cases under 
subpart F of this part, determined as a proportion of total capital 
payments under the Federal rate.
    (3) Exceptions payment adjustment factor. HCFA reduces the updated 
standard Federal rate by an adjustment factor equal to the estimated 
additional payments for exceptions under Sec. 412.348 determined as a 
proportion of total payments under the hospital-specific rate and 
Federal rate.
    (4) Budget neutrality adjustment factor. (i) For FY 1992 through FY 
1995, HCFA adjusts the updated standard Federal rate by a budget 
neutrality factor determined under Sec. 412.352.
    (ii) HCFA makes an adjustment to the Federal rate so that estimated 
aggregate payments for the fiscal year based on the Federal rate after 
any changes resulting from the annual reclassification and recalibration 
of the DRG weight in accordance with Sec. 412.60(e) and in the 
geographic adjustment factors described in Sec. 412.312(b)(2) equal 
estimated aggregate payments based on the Federal rate that would have 
been made without such changes.

[56 FR 43449, Aug. 30, 1991; 57 FR 3016, Jan. 27, 1992, as amended at 58 
FR 46339, Sept. 1, 1993; 59 FR 45399, Sept. 1, 1994; 60 FR 45849, Sept. 
1, 1995; 62 FR 46031, Aug. 29, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 412.312  Payment based on the Federal rate.

    (a) General. The payment amount for each discharge based on the 
Federal rate determined under Sec. 412.308(c) is determined under the 
following formula: [Federal rate X DRG weight X Geographic adjustment 
factor X Large urban add-on X (1 + Capital disproportionate share 
adjustment factor + capital indirect medical education adjustment 
factor) X (for hospitals located in Alaska and Hawaii, a cost-of-living 
adjustment factor)] + (Any applicable outlier payment).
    (b) Payment adjustments--(1) DRG weights. The relative resource 
requirements of the discharge are taken into account by applying the DRG 
weighting factor that is assigned to the discharge under Sec. 412.60.
    (2) Geographic adjustment factors--(i) Local cost variation. A 
geographic adjustment factor is applied that takes into account 
geographic variation in costs.
    (ii) Large urban add-on. An additional adjustment is made for 
hospitals located in a large urban area to reflect the higher costs 
incurred by hospitals located in those areas.
    (iii) Cost-of-living adjustment. An additional adjustment is made 
for hospitals located in Alaska and Hawaii to account for the higher 
cost-of-living in those States.
    (3) Disproportionate share adjustment. For hospitals with at least 
100 beds located in an urban area and serving low-income patients, a 
disproportionate share adjustment factor is applied that reflects the 
higher costs attributable

[[Page 353]]

to furnishing services to low income patients.
    (4) Indirect medical education adjustment. An additional adjustment 
is made based on the ratio of residents to the average daily patient 
census of the hospital to account for the indirect costs of medical 
education.
    (c) Additional payment for outlier cases. Payment is made for day 
outlier cases as provided for in Sec. 412.82 and for cost outlier cases 
if both capital-related and operating-related costs exceed the cost 
outlier threshold as provided for in Sec. 412.84.
    (d) Payment for transfer cases. Payment is made for transfer cases 
as provided for in Sec. 412.4.


<R05>
Sec. 412.316  Geographic adjustment factors.

    (a) Local cost variation. HCFA adjusts for local cost variation 
based on the hospital wage index value that is applicable to the 
hospital under Sec. 412.63(k). The adjustment factor equals the hospital 
wage index value applicable to the hospital raised to the .6848 power 
and is applied to 100 percent of the Federal rate.
    (b) Large urban location. HCFA provides an additional payment to a 
hospital located, for purposes of receiving payment under 
Sec. 412.63(a), in a large urban area equal to 3.0 percent of what would 
otherwise be payable to the hospital based on the Federal rate.
    (c) Cost-of-living adjustment. HCFA provides an additional payment 
to a hospital located in Alaska and Hawaii equal to [.3152 X (the cost-
of-living adjustment factor used to determine payments under 
Sec. 412.115 - 1)] percent.

Sec. 412.320  Disproportionate share adjustment factor.

    (a) Criteria for classification. A hospital is classified as a 
``disproportionate share hospital'' for the purposes of capital 
prospective payments if either of the following conditions is met:
    (1) The hospital is located, for purposes of receiving payment under 
Sec. 412.63(a), in an urban area, has 100 or more beds as determined in 
accordance with Sec. 412.105(b) and serves low-income patients, as 
determined under Sec. 412.106(b).
    (2) The hospital meets the criteria in Sec. 412.106(c)(2).
    (b) Payment adjustment factor. (1) If a hospital meets the criteria 
in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for a disproportionate share 
hospital for purposes of capital prospective payments, the 
disproportionate share payment adjustment factor equals [e raised to the 
power of (.2025  x the hospital's disproportionate patient percentage as 
determined under Sec. 412.106(b)(5)), -1], where e is the natural 
antilog of 1.
    (2) If a hospital meets the criteria in Sec. 412.106(c)(2) for 
purposes of hospital inpatient operating prospective payments, the 
disproportionate share adjustment factor is the factor that results from 
deeming the hospital to have the same disproportionate share patient 
percentage that would yield its operating disproportionate share 
adjustment.

Sec. 412.322  Indirect medical education adjustment factor.

    (a) Basic data. HCFA determines the following for each hospital:
    (1) The hospital's number of full-time equivalent residents as 
determined under Sec. 412.105(g).
    (2) The hospital's average daily census is determined by dividing 
the total number of inpatient days in the acute inpatient area of the 
hospital by the number of days in the cost reporting period.
    (3) The measurement of teaching activity is the ratio of the 
hospital's full-time equivalent residents to average daily census.
    (b) Payment adjustment factor. The indirect teaching adjustment 
factor equals [e (raised to the power of .2822 x the ratio of residents 
to average daily census)-1].

  Determination of Transition Period Payment Rates for Capital-Related 
                                  Costs


<R05>
Sec. 412.324  General description.

    (a) Hospitals under Medicare in FY 1991. During the ten-year 
transition period, payments to a hospital with a hospital-specific rate 
below the Federal rate are based on the fully prospective

[[Page 354]]

payment methodology under Sec. 412.340 or for a hospital with a 
hospital-specific rate above the Federal rate, the hold-harmless payment 
methodology under Sec. 412.344.
    (b) New hospitals. (1) A new hospital, as defined under 
Sec. 412.300(b), is paid 85 percent of its allowable Medicare inpatient 
hospital capital-related costs through its cost reporting period ending 
at least 2 years after the hospital accepts its first patient.
    (2) For the third year through the remainder of the transition 
period, the hospital is paid based on the fully prospective payment 
methodology or the hold-harmless payment methodology using the base 
period determined under Sec. 412.328(a)(2).
    (3) If the hospital is paid under the hold-harmless methodology 
described in Sec. 412.344, the hold-harmless payment for old capital 
costs described in Sec. 412.344(a)(1) is payable for up to and including 
8 years and may continue beyond the first cost reporting period 
beginning on or after October 1, 2000.
    (c) Hospitals with 52-53 week fiscal years ending September 25 
through September 29. For purposes of this subpart, a hospital with a 
52-53 week fiscal year period beginning September 26 through September 
30, 1992 is deemed to have the same beginning date for all cost 
reporting periods beginning before October 1, 2000 (unless the hospital 
later changes its cost reporting period).

<R05>
Sec. 412.328  Determining and updating the hospital-specific rate.

    (a) Base-year cost reporting period. (1) Last 12 month cost 
reporting period ending on or before December 31, 1990. For each 
hospital, the intermediary uses the hospital's latest 12-month or longer 
cost reporting period ending on or before December 31, 1990 as the base 
period to determine a hospital's hospital-specific rate.
    (2) New hospitals. The base-year cost reporting period for a new 
hospital is its 12-month cost reporting period (or a combination of cost 
reporting periods covering at least 12 months) that begins at least 1 
year after the hospital accepts its first patient.
    (3) Other hospitals. For other than a new hospital as defined in 
Sec. 412.300(b), if a hospital does not have a 12-month cost reporting 
period or does not have adequate Medicare utilization to file a cost 
report in a period ending on or before December 31, 1990, the hospital-
specific rate is based on the hospital's old capital costs (per 
discharge) in its first 12-month cost reporting period (or combination 
of cost reporting periods covering at least 12 months) ending after 
December 31, 1990.
    (b) Base-year costs per discharge. (1) Base period allowable 
inpatient capital costs per discharge. (i) Determination. The 
intermediary determines the base period allowable inpatient capital 
costs per discharge for the hospital by dividing the hospital's total 
allowable Medicare inpatient hospital capital-related cost in the base 
period by the number of Medicare discharges in the base period.
    (ii) Disposal of assets in the base year. When a depreciable asset 
has been disposed of in the base year, only that portion of the gain or 
loss that is allocated to the base-year cost reporting period is 
reflected in the hospital-specific rate.
    (iii) Disposal of assets subsequent to the base year. If an asset 
for which the Medicare program had recognized depreciation during the 
base year is disposed of subsequent to the base year, the hospital-
specific rate will not be revised to recognize the portion of the gain 
or loss allocated to the base year.
    (2) Discharges. For the purpose of determining a hospital's base 
period capital costs per discharge, a discharge includes discharges as 
defined in Sec. 412.4(a) and transfers as defined in Sec. 412.4(b)(2), 
adjusted by the transfer adjustment factor that is determined under 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
    (3) Transfer adjustment factor. (i) For base year cost reporting 
periods ending on or before December 31, 1990, HCFA uses the base year 
MEDPAR data received as of June 30, 1991 to develop an adjustment to 
discharges to account for transfers. HCFA divides the length of stay for 
each transfer case by the geometric mean length of stay for the DRG (but 
in no case using a number

[[Page 355]]

greater than 1.0) and assigns each nontransfer case a value of 1.0. To 
determine the transfer adjustment factor, HCFA adds together the 
adjusted discharges and divides the result by total discharges including 
transfers.
    (ii) For base year cost reporting periods ending after December 31, 
1990 but beginning before October 1, 1991, HCFA determines a transfer 
adjustment factor as described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section 
for a hospital using the applicable base year MEDPAR data on file as of 
the December 31 or June 30 occurring at least 6 months after the close 
of the approved base year.
    (iii) For base year cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 1991, the intermediary determines the transfer adjustment 
factor in place of HCFA as described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this 
section based on the most recent billing data available as of the date 
of the final determination of the hospital-specific rate.
    (c) Case-mix adjustment. (1) Determining transfer-adjusted case mix 
value. Step 1: For base year cost reporting periods ending on or before 
December 31, 1990, HCFA uses the base year MEDPAR data received as of 
June 30, 1991 to determine the hospital's transfer-adjusted case-mix 
value. For base year cost reporting periods ending after December 31, 
1990 and beginning before October 1, 1991, HCFA determines a transfer-
adjusted case-mix value for a hospital using the applicable base year 
MEDPAR data on file as of the December 31 or June 30 occurring at least 
6 months after the close of the base year. For base year cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991, the intermediary 
determines the transfer-adjusted case-mix value based on the most recent 
billing data available as of the date of the final determination of the 
hospital-specific rate. HCFA or the intermediary, as appropriate, 
multiplies the DRG weight for each case by one of the following factors:
    (i) If the case is not a transfer, the factor equals 1.0.
    (ii) If the case is a transfer, the factor equals the lesser of 1.0 
or the ratio of the length of stay for the case divided by the geometric 
mean length of stay for the DRG.

Step 2: The products derived for all cases under Step 1 are added 
together and the result is divided by the adjusted discharges used to 
calculate the transfer adjustment factor determined under paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section.
    (2) Adjusting base period capital costs per discharge by the 
hospital's transfer-adjusted case-mix value. The intermediary divides 
the base period capital costs per discharge for each hospital as 
determined in paragraph (b) of this section by the hospital's transfer-
adjusted case mix value for the cost reporting period determined under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (d) Updatinq to FY 1992. The intermediary updates the case-mix 
adjusted base period costs per discharge to FY 1992 based on the 
national average increase in Medicare inpatient capital costs per 
discharge as estimated by HCFA, excluding the portion of the increase in 
capital costs per discharge attributable to changes in case mix.
    (e) Hospital-specific rate. The intermediary determines the 
hospital-specific rate each year by adjusting the amount determined 
under paragraph (d) of this section by the following factors:
    (1) Update factor. After FY 1992, the intermediary updates the 
hospital-specific rate in accordance with Sec. 412.308(c)(1).
    (2) Exceptions payment adjustment factor. For FY 1992 through FY 
2001, the intermediary reduces the updated amount determined in 
paragraph (d) of this section by an adjustment factor equal to the 
estimated additional payments for capital-related costs for exceptions 
under Sec. 412.348, determined as a proportion of the total amount of 
payments under the hospital-specific rate and Federal rate.
    (3) Budget neutrality adjustment factor. For FY 1992 through FY 
1995, the intermediary adjusts the updated amount determined in 
paragraph (d) of this section by a budget neutrality adjustment factor 
determined under Sec. 412.352.
    (4) Payment for transfer cases. Effective FY 1996, the intermediary 
reduces the updated amount determined in paragraph (d) of this section 
by 0.28 percent to account for the effect of the

[[Page 356]]

revised policy for payment of transfers under Sec. 412.4(d).
    (5) Reduction of rate: FY 1998. Effective FY 1998, the unadjusted 
hospital-specific rate as in effect on September 30, 1997 described in 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section is reduced by 15.68 percent.
    (6) Reduction of rate: FY 1998 through FY 2002. For discharges 
occurring on or after October 1, 1997 through September 30, 2002, the 
unadjusted hospital-specific rate in effect on September 30, 1997, 
described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section is further reduced by 2.1 
percent.
    (f) Redetermination of hospital-specific rate. (1) General. (i) Upon 
request by a hospital, the intermediary redetermines the hospital-
specific rate to reflect an increase in old capital costs as determined 
in a cost reporting period subsequent to the base year. An increase in 
Medicare old capital cost per discharge that is related solely to a 
decline in utilization is not recognized as an increase in old capital 
costs for purposes of this section. New capital costs are excluded from 
the redetermination of the hospital-specific rate.
    (ii) The hospital may request redetermination for any cost reporting 
period beginning subsequent to the base period but no later than the 
later of the hospital's cost reporting period beginning in FY 1994 or 
the cost reporting period beginning after obligated capital that is 
recognized as old capital under Sec. 412.302(b) is put in use.
    (iii) The hospital must request a redetermination in writing no 
later than the date the cost report must be filed with the hospital's 
intermediary for the first cost reporting period beginning on or after 
October 1, 1991 or the cost reporting period that will serve as the new 
base period, whichever is later. The hospital's redetermination request 
must include the cost report for the new base period and an estimate of 
the revised hospital-specific rate indicating that the new rate exceeds 
the hospital's current hospital-specific rate.
    (2) Determination of old capital costs. The intermediary determines 
the hospital's old capital costs for the subsequent cost reporting 
period that will serve as the new base period. The intermediary includes 
the costs of obligated capital that are recognized as old capital costs 
under Sec. 412.302(b), excludes the costs of assets disposed of 
subsequent to the initial base year, and reflects changes in allowable 
old capital costs occurring subsequent to the initial base period.
    (3) Redetermined hospital-specific rate. The intermediary 
redetermines the hospital-specific rate based on the old capital costs 
that are determined under paragraph (f)(2) of this section for the new 
base period. The intermediary--
    (i) Divides the hospital's old capital costs for the new base period 
by the number of Medicare discharges in that cost reporting period 
(consistent with paragraph (b) of this section);
    (ii) Divides the old capital costs per discharge by the hospital's 
transfer adjusted case-mix value for the new base period (consistent 
with paragraph (c) of this section);
    (iii) Applies an update factor, if appropriate, to account for 
inflation occurring subsequent to the new base year, an exceptions 
payment adjustment factor, and a budget neutrality adjustment factor 
(consistent with paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section).
    (4) Denial by intermediary. If the intermediary determines, after 
audit, that the revised hospital-specific rate is lower than the current 
hospital-specific rate, it advises the hospital that its request is 
denied and explains the basis for the denial.
    (5) Implementation date. The redetermined hospital-specific rate 
applies to discharges occurring on or after the beginning date of the 
new base period.
    (g) Review and revision of the hospital-specific rate. (1) Interim 
determination. The intermediary makes an interim determination of the 
hospital-specific rate based on the best data available and notifies the 
hospital at least 30 days before the beginning of the hospital's first 
cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1991.
    (2) Final determination. (i) The intermediary makes a final 
determination of the hospital-specific rate based on the final 
settlement of the base period cost report.
    (ii) The final determination of the hospital-specific rate is 
effective retroactively to the beginning of the hospital's first cost 
reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1991 or, in

[[Page 357]]

the case of a redetermination of the hospital-specific rate under 
Sec. 412.328(f), to the beginning of the new base period.
    (iii) The final determination of the hospital-specific rate is 
subject to administrative and judicial review in accordance with subpart 
R of part 405 of this chapter, governing provider reimbursement 
determinations and appeals.
    (iv) The intermediary adjusts the hospital-specific rate to reflect 
any revisions that result from administrative or judicial review of the 
final determination of hospital-specific rate. The revised determination 
is effective retroactively to the same extent as in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) 
of this section.

Sec. 412.331  Determining hospital-specific rates in cases of hospital merger, consolidation, or dissolution.

    (a) Hospital merger or consolidation. If, after the base year, two 
or more hospitals merge or consolidate into one hospital as provided for 
under Sec. 413.134(k) of this chapter, the intermediary determines a 
revised hospital-specific rate applicable to the combined facility under 
Sec. 412.328, which is effective beginning with the date of merger or 
consolidation. The following rules apply to the revised hospital-
specific rate and payment determination:
    (1) Revised hospital-specific rate. Using each hospital's base 
period data, the intermediary determines a combined average discharge 
weighted hospital-specific rate.
    (2) Payment determination. The discharge-weighted hospital-specific 
rate determined by the intermediary is compared to the Federal rate to 
establish the appropriate payment methodology under Sec. 412.336 and for 
payment purposes under Secs. 412.340 or 412.344. The revised payment 
methodology is effective as of the date of merger or consolidation.
    (3) Old capital cost determination. The capital-related costs 
related to the assets of each merged or consolidated hospital as of 
December 31, 1990 are recognized as old capital costs during the 
transition period. If the hospital is paid under the hold-harmless 
methodology after merger or consolidation, only that original base year 
old capital is eligible for hold-harmless payments.
    (b) Hospital dissolution. If a hospital separates into two or more 
hospitals that are subject to capital payments under this subpart after 
the base year, the intermediary determines new hospital-specific rates 
for each separate hospital under the provisions of Sec. 412.328 
effective as of the date of the dissolution. The new hospital-specific 
rates are determined as follows:
    (1) Hospital-specific rate--(i) Adequate base year data. The 
intermediary determines whether the base year capital-related cost data 
and necessary statistical records are adequate to reconstruct the cost 
and other data required under Sec. 412.328 from the former hospital's 
financial records to determine the hospital-specific rates for each 
facility. If the data are adequate, the intermediary uses the former 
hospital's base period to determine the hospital-specific rate for each 
separate hospital.
    (ii) Inadequate original base year data. If the intermediary 
determines that the base period data for the former hospital is 
inadequate to establish separate hospital-specific rates, the 
intermediary establishes a new base period for each hospital. The new 
base period is each hospital's first 12-month or longer cost reporting 
period (or combination of cost reporting periods covering at least 12 
months) immediately following separation of the hospitals. The 
intermediary determines the hospital-specific rate for each hospital 
using the new base period under Sec. 412.328.
    (2) Payment determinations. The intermediary applies the payment 
methodology provisions of Sec. 412.336. The revised payment 
determination is effective as of the date of the hospital's dissolution.
    (3) Old capital cost determination. In determining the old capital 
costs for each hospital, the amount recognized as old capital is limited 
to the allowable capital-related costs attributable to assets that were 
in use for patient care as of December 31, 1990, and the hospitals are 
subject to all other transition period rules of this subpart.

Sec. 412.332  Payment based on the hospital-specific rate.

    The payment amount for each discharge (as defined in Sec. 412.4(a)) 
based on the hospital-specific rate determined under Sec. 412.328 (e) or 
(f) is determined by multiplying the applicable hospital-specific rate 
by the DRG weighting factor applicable to the discharge under 
Sec. 412.60 and the applicable hospital-specific rate percentage for the 
pertinent cost reporting period under Sec. 412.340.


<R05>
Sec. 412.336  Transition period payment methodologies.

    (a) General. For discharges occurring in cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after October 1, 1991 and before October 1, 2001, a 
hospital is paid under one of two payment methodologies described in 
Sec. 412.340 and Sec. 412.344. Except as provided under paragraph (b) of 
this section, a hospital is paid under the same methodology throughout 
the transition period.
    (1) Hospital-specific rate below the Federal rate. A hospital with a 
hospital-specific rate below the Federal rate (after taking into account 
the estimated effect of the payment adjustments and outlier payments) is 
paid under the fully prospective payment methodology as described in 
Sec. 412.340.
    (2) Hospital-specific rate above the Federal rate. A hospital with a 
hospital-specific rate that is above the Federal rate (after taking into 
account the estimated effect of the payment adjustments and outlier 
payments) is paid under the hold-harmless payment methodology as 
described in Sec. 412.344.
    (b) Special rule for revised hospital-specific rate. If a hospital 
with a hospital-specific rate below the Federal rate requests that its 
hospital-specific rate be redetermined, the redetermined hospital-
specific rate is compared to the Federal rate that is applicable to the 
new base period (after taking into account the estimated effect of the 
payment adjustments and outlier payments). If the redetermined hospital-
specific rate is higher than the Federal rate, the hospital is paid 
under the hold-harmless methodology effective with the beginning of the 
new base period and continuing throughout the remainder of the 
transition.
    (c) Interim and final determinations of applicable payment 
methodology--(1) Interim determination. The intermediary makes an 
interim determination of the applicable payment methodology based on the 
best data available and notifies the hospital of its determination at 
least 30 days before the beginning of the hospital's first cost 
reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1991.
    (2) Final determination. (i) The intermediary makes a final 
determination of the applicable payment methodology based on its final 
determination of the hospital's hospital-specific rate. The final 
determination of the applicable payment methodology is effective 
retroactively to the beginning of the hospital's first cost reporting 
period beginning on or after October 1, 1991.
    (ii) If the hospital-specific rate is redetermined in accordance 
with Sec. 412.328(f), the intermediary makes a new determination of the 
applicable payment methodology. The new determination is effective 
retroactively to the beginning of the new base period.
    (iii) If the hospital-specific rate is revised under Sec. 412.328(g) 
as a result of administrative or judicial review, the intermediary makes 
a new determination of the applicable payment methodology. The new 
determination is effective retroactively to the beginning of the 
hospital's first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 
1991 or to the beginning of the new base period.
    (d) Special Rule for Redetermination of Hospital Payment 
Methodology. For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 
1993, the intermediary redetermines the hospital payment methodologies 
to take into account the reduction to the standard Federal rate provided 
in Sec. 412.308(b)(2):
    (1) For a hospital paid under the fully prospective payment 
methodology in the last hospital cost reporting period beginning before 
October 1, 1993, the intermediary compares the hospital's FY 1994 
hospital-specific rate with the hospital's FY 1994 Federal rate (after 
taking into account the estimated effect of the payment adjustments and 
outlier payments).

[[Page 359]]

    (i) A hospital with a FY 1994 hospital-specific rate that is above 
the FY 1994 adjusted Federal rate is paid under the hold-harmless 
payment methodology described in Sec. 412.344.
    (ii) Subject to the provisions of Sec. 412.328(f), a hospital with a 
FY 1994 hospital-specific rate that is below the FY 1994 adjusted 
Federal rate continues to be paid under the fully prospective payment 
methodology as described in Sec. 412.340.
    (iii) The intermediary notifies the hospital of the new 
determination of the hospital's payment methodology within 90 days of 
the hospital's first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 
1, 1993. The new determination is effective to the beginning of the 
hospital's first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 
1993.
    (2) A hospital paid under the hold-harmless payment methodology in 
the last cost reporting period beginning before October 1, 1993, will 
continue to be paid in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 412.344.

Sec. 412.344  Hold-harmless payment methodology.

    (a) General. A hospital paid under the hold-harmless payment 
methodology receives a payment per discharge based on the higher of:
    (1) 85 percent of reasonable costs for old capital costs (100 
percent for sole community hospitals) plus an amount for new capital 
costs based on a proportion of the Federal rate. The proportion is equal 
to the ratio of the hospital's Medicare inpatient costs for new capital 
to total Medicare inpatient capital costs; or
    (2) 100 percent of the Federal rate.
    (3) Exceptions. (i) A hospital that would receive higher payment 
under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may elect payment based on 100 
percent of the Federal rate under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (ii) A hospital that does not maintain records that are adequate to 
identify its old capital costs is deemed to have elected payment per 
discharge based on 100 percent of the Federal rate.
    (b) Continued basis of payment. A hospital paid based on 100 percent 
of the Federal rate during the later of its cost reporting period 
beginning in FY 1994 or its first cost reporting period beginning after 
obligated capital that is recognized as old capital under 
Sec. 412.302(b) is put in use continues to be paid on that basis in 
subsequent cost reporting periods during the transition period and does 
not receive a reasonable cost payment for old capital costs under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (c) Basis of determination. The determination under paragraph (a) of 
this section regarding which payment alternative is applicable is made 
without regard to additional payments under the exceptions process under 
Sec. 412.348.
    (d) Interim and final payment determinations. (1) Using the best 
data available, the intermediary makes an interim payment determination 
under paragraph (a) of this section concerning the applicable payment 
alternative, and, in the case of payment under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, the payment amounts for old and new capital. The intermediary 
notifies the hospital of its determination at least 30 days before the 
beginning of the hospital's first cost reporting period beginning on or 
after October 1, 1991. The intermediary may revise its determination 
based on additional information submitted by the hospital and make 
appropriate adjustments retroactively.
    (2) The final determination of the amount payable under paragraph 
(a) of

[[Page 360]]

this section is based on final settlement of the Medicare cost report 
for the applicable cost reporting period and is effective retroactively 
to the beginning of that cost reporting period. This final determination 
is subject to administrative and judicial review in accordance with 
subpart R of part 405 of this chapter, governing provider reimbursement 
determinations and appeals.

<R05>
Sec. 412.348  Exception payments.

    (a) Definitions. As used in this section--
    Annual operating expenses. Annual operating expenses means the sum 
of net expenses for all reimbursable cost centers for a 12 month cost 
reporting period. Annual operating expenses are obtained from the 
Medicare cost report.
    Average age of fixed assets. The average age of fixed assets is the 
ratio of accumulated depreciation for buildings and fixed equipment to 
current depreciation expense for buildings and fixed equipment. The 
average age of fixed assets is determined from information on the 
Medicare cost report.
    Fixed assets. Fixed assets mean buildings and fixed equipment.
    (b) Criterion for additional payment during the transition period. 
An additional payment is made to a hospital paid under either the fully 
prospective payment methodology or the hold-harmless payment methodology 
as determined under paragraph (c) of this section for cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991 and before October 1, 
2001.
    (c) Minimum payment level by class of hospital. (1) HCFA establishes 
a minimum payment level by class of hospital. The minimum payment level 
for a hospital will equal a fixed percentage of the hospital's capital-
related costs. The minimum payment levels may be no greater than the 
percentages of allowable capital-related costs that follow:
    (i) 90 percent for sole community hospitals.
    (ii) 80 percent for hospitals located in an urban area for purposes 
of Sec. 412.63(a) with at least 100 beds, as determined under 
Sec. 412.105(b), that have a disproportionate share patient percentage 
of at least 20.2 percent as determined under Sec. 412.106(b), and for 
hospitals located in an urban area for purposes of Sec. 412.63(a) with 
at least 100 beds that qualify for disproportionate share payments under 
Sec. 412.106(c)(2).
    (iii) 70 percent for all other hospitals.
    (2) When it is necessary to adjust the minimum payment levels set by 
class of hospitals specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (g)(6) of this 
section, HCFA will adjust those levels for each class of hospitals in 
one percentage point increments as necessary to satisfy the requirement 
specified in paragraph (h) of this section that total estimated payments 
under the exception process not exceed 10 percent of the total estimated 
capital prospective payments (exclusive of hold-harmless payments for 
old capital) for the same fiscal year.
    (d) Additional payments. A hospital is entitled to an additional 
payment if its capital payments for the cost reporting period would 
otherwise be less than the applicable minimum payment level. The 
additional payment equals the difference between the applicable minimum 
payment level and the capital payments that the hospital would otherwise 
receive minus any offset amount determined under paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section.
    (e) Determining a hospital's exception payment amount--(1) 
Cumulative comparison. For each cost reporting period beginning before 
October 1, 2001, the hospital's exception payment is determined by 
comparing the cumulative payments made to the hospital under the capital 
prospective payment system to the cumulative minimum payment levels 
applicable to the hospital for each cost reporting period subject to the 
prospective payment system.
    (2) Offsetting amounts. Any amount by which the hospital's 
cumulative payments exceed its cumulative minimum payment levels is 
deducted from the additional payment that would otherwise be payable for 
a cost reporting period.
    (f) Additional payment exception for extraordinary circumstances. 
(1) A hospital may request an additional payment if the hospital incurs 
unanticipated capital expenditures in excess of $5 million

[[Page 361]]

(net of proceeds from other payment sources such as insurance, 
litigation decisions and other State, local or Federal government 
funding programs) due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the 
hospital's control. Extraordinary circumstances include, but are not 
limited to, a flood, fire, or earthquake.
    (2) A hospital must apply to its HCFA Regional Office by the later 
of October 1, 1992 or 180 days after the extraordinary circumstance 
causing the unanticipated expenditures for a determination by HCFA of 
whether the hospital is eligible for an additional payment based on the 
nature of the circumstances and the amount of financial loss documented 
by the hospital.
    (3) Except for sole community hospitals, the additional payment is 
based on a minimum payment amount of 85 percent for Medicare's share of 
allowable capital-related costs attributable to the extraordinary 
circumstances. For sole community hospitals, the minimum payment amount 
is 100 percent.
    (4) The minimum payment level applicable under paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section is adjusted to take into account the 85 percent minimum 
payment level (100 percent for sole community hospitals) under paragraph 
(f)(3) of this section for the unanticipated capital-related costs. The 
additional payment for the cost reporting period equals the difference 
between the adjusted minimum payment level and the capital payments the 
hospital would otherwise receive less any offset amount determined under 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (g) Special exceptions process. For eligible hospitals that meet a 
project need requirement, a project size requirement, and, in the case 
of certain urban hospitals, meet an excess capacity test, an additional 
payment may be made for up to 10 years beyond the end of the capital 
prospective payment system transition period.
    (1) Eligible hospitals. The following classes of hospitals are 
eligible to receive exceptions payments under this special exceptions 
provision:
    (i) Sole community hospitals.
    (ii) Hospitals located in an urban area under Sec. 412.63(a) with at 
least 100 beds, as determined under Sec. 412.105(b), that either have a 
disproportionate share of at least 20.2 percent as determined under 
Sec. 412.106(b) or qualify for disproportionate share payments under 
Sec. 412.106(c)(2).
    (iii) Hospitals with a combined inpatient Medicare and Medicaid 
utilization of at least 70 percent.
    (2) Project need requirement. A hospital must show that it has 
obtained any required approval from a State or local planning authority. 
If a hospital is not required to obtain approval from a planning 
authority, it must satisfy the age of asset test specified in paragraph 
(g)(3) of this section and, in the case of an urban hospital, the excess 
capacity test under paragraph (g)(4) of this section.
    (3) Age of assets test. A hospital must show that its average age of 
fixed assets is at or above the 75th percentile for the hospital's first 
cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1991.
    (4) Excess capacity test for urban hospitals. Urban hospitals that 
are not required to receive approval from a State or local planning 
authority must demonstrate that either--
    (i) The overall average occupancy rate in its metropolitan 
statistical area is at least 80 percent; or
    (ii) After completion of the project, its capacity is no more than 
80 percent of its prior capacity (in terms of bed size).
    (5) Project size requirement. A hospital must complete, during the 
period from the beginning of its first cost reporting period beginning 
on or after October 1, 1991 to the end of its last cost reporting period 
beginning before October 1, 2001, a project whose costs for replacement 
and/or renovation of fixed assets related to patient care are at least:
    (i) $200 million; or
    (ii) 100 percent of its operating cost during the first 12 month 
cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1991.
    (6) Minimum payment level. The minimum payment level for qualifying 
hospitals will be 70 percent.
    (7) Limitation on the period for exception payments. A qualifying 
hospital may receive an exceptions payment for up to 10 years from the 
year in which it completes a project for replacement or

[[Page 362]]

renovation of capital assets that meets project need and project size 
requirements (and, if applicable, excess capacity test), provided that 
it completes the project no later than the end of the hospital's last 
cost reporting period beginning before October 1, 2001. A project is 
considered to be completed when the assets are put into use for patient 
care.
    (8) Determining a hospital's exception payment amount--(i) 
Cumulative comparison. For each cost reporting period, the hospital's 
exception payment is determined by comparing the cumulative payments 
made to the hospital under the capital prospective payment system to the 
cumulative minimum payment levels applicable to the hospital for each 
cost reporting period subject to the prospective payment system.
    (ii) Offsetting amounts. Offsetting amounts are applied in the 
following order--(A) Any amount by which the hospital's cumulative 
payments exceed its cumulative minimum payment levels is deducted from 
the additional payment that would otherwise be payable for a cost 
reporting period.
    (B) Any amount by which the hospital's current year Medicare 
inpatient operating and capital prospective payment system payments 
(excluding, if applicable, 75 percent of the hospital's operating 
prospective payment system disproportionate share payments) exceed its 
Medicare inpatient operating and capital costs is deducted from the 
additional payment that would otherwise be payable for the cost 
reporting period. For purposes of calculating the offset, the costs and 
payments for services that are not subject to the hospital inpatient 
prospective payment system are excluded.
    (h) Limit on exception payments. Total estimated payments under the 
exception process may not exceed 10 percent of the total estimated 
capital prospective payments (exclusive of hold-harmless payments for 
old capital) for the same fiscal year.

[59 FR 45399, Sept. 1, 1994, as amended at 62 FR 46031, Aug. 29. 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 412.352  Budget neutrality adjustment.

    For FY 1992 through FY 1995, HCFA will determine an adjustment to 
the hospital-specific rate and the Federal rate proportionately so that 
the estimated aggregate payments under this subpart for inpatient 
hospital capital costs each fiscal year will equal 90 percent of what 
HCFA estimates would have been paid for capital-related costs on a 
reasonable cost basis under Sec. 413.130 of this chapter.

    (1) 50 percent of a Puerto Rico capital rate based on data from 
Puerto Rico hospitals only, which is determined in accordance with 
procedures for developing the Federal rate; and
    (2) 50 percent of the Federal rate, as determined under 
Sec. 412.308.
    (b) Effective for fiscal year 1998, the Puerto Rico capital rate 
described in paragraph (a) of this section in effect on September 30,

<R04>
                Subpart A--Introduction and General Rules


<R05>
Sec. 413.1  Introduction.

    (a) Basis, scope, and applicability. (1) Statutory basis. (i) Basic 
provisions. (A) Section 1815 of the Act requires that the Secretary make 
interim payments to providers and periodically determine the amount that 
should be paid under Part A of Medicare to each provider for the 
services it furnishes.
    (B) Section 1814(b) of the Act (for Part A) and section 1833(a) (for 
Part B) provide for payment on the basis of the lesser of a provider's 
reasonable costs or customary charges.
    (C) Section 1861(v) of the Act defines ``reasonable cost''.
    (ii) Additional provisions. (A) Section 1138(b) of the Act specifies 
the conditions for Medicare payment for organ procurement costs.
    (B) Section 1814(j) of the Act provides for exceptions to the 
``lower of costs or charges'' provisions.
    (C) Sections 1815(a) and 1833(e) of the Act provide the Secretary 
with authority to request information from providers to determine the 
amount of Medicare payment due providers.
    (D) Section 1833(a)(4) and (i)(3) of the Act provide for payment of 
a blended amount for certain surgical services furnished in a hospital's 
outpatient department.
    (E) Section 1833(n) of the Act provides for payment of a blended 
amount for outpatient hospital diagnostic procedures such as radiology.
    (F) Section 1834(c)(1)(C) of the Act establishes the method for 
determining Medicare payment for screening mammograms performed by 
hospitals.
    (G) Section 1834(g) of the Act provides that payment for critical 
access hospital (CAH) outpatient services is the reasonable costs of the 
CAH in providing these services, as determined in accordance with 
section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act and the applicable principles of cost 
reimbursement in this part and in part 415 of this chapter.
    (H) Section 1881 of the Act authorizes payment for services 
furnished to ESRD patients.
    (I) Section 1883 of the Act provides for payment for post-hospital 
SNF care furnished by a rural hospital that has swing-bed approval.
    (J) Sections 1886(a) and (b) of the Act impose a ceiling on the rate 
of increase in hospital inpatient costs.
    (K) Section 1886(h) of the Act provides for payment to a hospital 
for the services of interns and residents in approved teaching programs 
on the basis of a ``per resident'' amount.
    (2) Scope. This part sets forth regulations governing Medicare 
payment for services furnished to beneficiaries by--
    (i) Hospitals and critical access hospitals (CAHs);
    (ii) Skilled nursing facilities (SNFs);
    (iii) Home health agencies (HHAs);
    (iv) Comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facilities (CORFs);
    (v) End-stage renal disease (ESRD) facilities;
    (vi) Providers of outpatient physical therapy and speech pathology 
services (OPTs); and
    (vii) Organ procurement agencies (OPAs) and histocompatibility 
laboratories.

[[Page 365]]

    (viii) Community mental health centers (CMHCs) but only for purposes 
of furnishing partial hospitalization services.
    (3) Applicability. The payment principles and related policies set 
forth in this part are binding on HCFA and its fiscal intermediaries, on 
the Provider Reimbursement Review Board, and on the entities listed in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (b) Reasonable cost reimbursement. Except as provided under 
paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section, Medicare is generally 
required, under section 1814(b) of the Act (for services covered under 
Part A) and under section 1833(a)(2) of the Act (for services covered 
under Part B) to pay for services furnished by providers on the basis of 
reasonable costs as defined in section 1861(v) of the Act, or the 
provider's customary charges for those services, if lower. Regulations 
implementing section 1861(v) are found generally in this part beginning 
at Sec. 413.5.
    (c) Outpatient maintenance dialysis and related services. Section 
1881 of the Act authorizes special rules for the coverage of and payment 
for services furnished to ESRD patients. Sections 413.170 and 413.174 
implement various provisions of section 1881. In particular, 
Sec. 413.170 establishes a prospective payment method for outpatient 
maintenance dialysis services that applies both to hospital-based and 
independent ESRD facilities, and under which Medicare pays for both home 
and infacility dialysis services furnished on or after August 1, 1983.
    (d) Payment for inpatient hospital services. (1) For cost reporting 
periods beginning before October 1, 1983, the amount paid for inpatient 
hospital services is determined on a reasonable cost basis.
    (2) Payment to short-term general hospitals located in the 50 States 
and the District of Columbia for the operating costs of hospital 
inpatient services for cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 1983, and for the capital-related costs of inpatient services 
for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991, are 
determined prospectively on a per discharge basis under part 412 of this 
chapter except as follows:
    (i) Payment for capital-related costs for cost reporting periods 
beginning before October 1, 1991, medical education costs, kidney 
acquisition costs, and the costs of certain anesthesia services, is 
described in Sec. 412.113 of this chapter.
    (ii) Payment to children's, psychiatric, rehabilitation and long-
term hospitals (as well as separate psychiatric and rehabilitation units 
(distinct parts) of short-term general hospitals), which are excluded 
from the prospective payment system under subpart B of part 412 of this 
chapter, and to hospitals outside the 50 States and the District of 
Columbia is on a reasonable cost basis, subject to the provisions of 
Sec. 413.40.
    (iii) Payment to hospitals subject to a State reimbursement control 
system is described in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (e) State reimbursement control systems. Beginning October 1, 1983, 
Medicare reimbursement for inpatient hospital services may be made in 
accordance with a State reimbursement control system rather than under 
the Medicare reimbursement principles set forth in this part, if the 
State system is approved by HCFA. Regulations implementing this 
alternative reimbursement authority are set forth in subpart C of part 
403 of this chapter.
    (f) Services of qualified nonphysician anesthetists. For cost 
reporting periods, or any part of a cost reporting period, beginning on 
or after January 1, 1989, costs incurred for the services of qualified 
nonphysician anesthetists are not paid on a reasonable cost basis unless 
the provisions of Sec. 412.113(c)(2) of this chapter apply. These 
services are paid under the special rules set forth in Sec. 405.553 of 
this chapter.
    (g) Prospectively determined payment rates for low Medicare volume 
SNFs. Rules governing requests by SNFs for prospectively determined

Sec. 413.5  Cost reimbursement: General.

    (a) In formulating methods for making fair and equitable 
reimbursement for services rendered beneficiaries of the program, 
payment is to be made on the basis of current costs of the individual 
provider, rather than costs of a past period or a fixed negotiated rate. 
All necessary and proper expenses of an institution in the production of 
services, including normal standby costs, are recognized. Furthermore, 
the share of the total institutional cost that is borne by the program 
is related to the care furnished beneficiaries so that no part of their 
cost would need to be borne by other patients. Conversely, costs 
attributable to other patients of the institution are not to be borne by 
the program. Thus, the application of this approach, with appropriate 
accounting support, will result in meeting actual costs of services to 
beneficiaries as such costs vary from institution to institution. 
However, payments to providers of services for services furnished 
Medicare beneficiaries are subject to the provisions of Secs. 413.13 and 
413.30.
    (b) Putting these several points together, certain tests have been 
evolved for the principles of reimbursement and certain goals have been 
established that they should be designed to accomplish. In general 
terms, these are the tests or objectives:
    (1) That the methods of reimbursement should result in current 
payment so that institutions will not be disadvantaged, as they 
sometimes are under other arrangements, by having to put up money for 
the purchase of goods and services well before they receive 
reimbursement.
    (2) That, in addition to current payment, there should be 
retroactive adjustment so that increases in costs are taken fully into 
account as they actually occurred, not just prospectively.
    (3) That there be a division of the allowable costs between the 
beneficiaries of this program and the other patients of the provider 
that takes account of the actual use of services by the beneficiaries of 
this program and that is fair to each provider individually.
    (4) That there be sufficient flexibility in the methods of 
reimbursement to be used, particularly at the beginning of the program, 
to take account of the great differences in the present state of 
development of recordkeeping.
    (5) That the principles should result in the equitable treatment of 
both nonprofit organizations and profit-making organizations.
    (6) That there should be a recognition of the need of hospitals and 
other providers to keep pace with growing needs and to make 
improvements.
    (c) As formulated herein, the principles given recognition to such 
factors as depreciation, interest, bad debts, educational costs, 
compensation of owners, and an allowance for a reasonable return on 
equity capital (in the case of certain proprietary providers). With 
respect to allowable costs some items of inclusion and exclusion are:
    (1) An appropriate part of the net cost of approved educational 
activities will be included.
    (2) Costs incurred for research purposes, over and above usual 
patient care, will not be included.
    (3) [Reserved]
    (4) The value of services provided by nonpaid workers, as members of 
an organization (including services of members of religious orders) 
having an agreement with the provider to furnish such services, is 
includable in the amount that would be paid others for similar work.
    (5) Discounts and allowances received on the purchase of goods or 
services are reductions of the cost to which they relate.
    (6) Bad debts growing out of the failure of a beneficiary to pay the 
deductible, or the coinsurance, will be reimbursed (after bona fide 
efforts at collection).
    (7) Charity and courtesy allowances are not includable, although 
``fringe benefit'' allowances for employees under a formal plan will be 
includable as part of their compensation.
    (8) A reasonable allowance of compensation for the services of 
owners in profitmaking organizations will be allowed providing their 
services are actually performed in a necessary function.
    (9) Reasonable cost of physicians' direct medical and surgical 
services (including supervision of interns and residents in the care of 
individual patients) furnished in a teaching hospital may be

[[Page 367]]

reimbursed as a provider cost (as described in Sec. 415.162 of this 
chapter) if elected as provided for in Sec. 415.160 of this chapter.
    (d) In developing these principles of reimbursement for the Medicare 
program, all of the considerations inherent in allowances for 
depreciation were studied. The principles, as presented, provide options 
to meet varied situations. Depreciation will essentially be on an 
historical cost basis but since many institutions do not have adequate 
records of old assets, the principles provide an optional allowance in 
lieu of such depreciation for assets acquired before 1966. For assets 
acquired after 1965, the historical cost basis must be used. All assets 
actually in use for production of services for Medicare beneficiaries 
will be recognized even though they may have been fully or partially 
depreciated for other purposes. Assets financed with public funds may be 
depreciated. Although funding of depreciation is not required, there is 
an incentive for it since income from funded depreciation is not 
considered as an offset which must be taken to reduce the interest 
expense that is allowable as a program cost.
    (e) A return on the equity capital of proprietary facilities, as 
described in Sec. 413.157, is an allowance in addition to the reasonable 
cost of covered services furnished to beneficiaries.
    (f) Renal dialysis items and services furnished under the ESRD 
provision are reimbursed and reported under Secs. 413.170 and 413.174 
respectively. For special rules concerning health maintenance 
organizations (HMOs), and providers of services and other health care 
facilities that are owned or operated by an HMO, or related to an HMO by 
common ownership or control, see Secs. 417.242(b)(14) and 417.250(c) of 
this chapter.

Sec. 413.9  Cost related to patient care.

    (a) Principle. All payments to providers of services must be based 
on the reasonable cost of services covered under Medicare and related to 
the care of beneficiaries. Reasonable cost includes all necessary and 
proper costs incurred in furnishing the services, subject to principles 
relating to specific items of revenue and cost. However, for cost 
reporting periods beginning after December 31, 1973, payments to 
providers of services are based on the lesser of the reasonable cost of 
services covered under Medicare and furnished to program beneficiaries 
or the customary charges to the general public for such services, as 
provided for in Sec. 413.13.
    (b) Definitions--(1) Reasonable cost. Reasonable cost of any 
services must be determined in accordance with regulations establishing 
the method or methods to be used, and the items to be included. The 
regulations in this part take into account both direct and indirect 
costs of providers of services. The objective is that under the methods 
of determining costs, the costs with respect to individuals covered by 
the program will not be borne by individuals not so covered, and the 
costs with respect to individuals not so covered will not be borne by 
the program. These regulations also provide for the making of suitable 
retroactive adjustments after the provider has submitted fiscal and 
statistical reports. The retroactive adjustment will represent the 
difference between the amount received by the provider during the year 
for covered services from both Medicare and the beneficiaries and the 
amount determined in accordance with an accepted method of cost 
apportionment to be the actual cost of services furnished to 
beneficiaries during the year.
    (2) Necessary and proper costs. Necessary and proper costs are costs 
that are appropriate and helpful in developing and maintaining the 
operation of patient care facilities and activities. They are usually 
costs that are common and accepted occurrences in the field of the 
provider's activity.
    (c) Application. (1) It is the intent of Medicare that payments to 
providers of services should be fair to the providers, to the 
contributors to the Medicare trust funds, and to other patients.
    (2) The costs of providers' services vary from one provider to 
another and

[[Page 368]]

the variations generally reflect differences in scope of services and 
intensity of care. The provision in Medicare for payment of reasonable 
cost of services is intended to meet the actual costs, however widely 
they may vary from one institution to another. This is subject to a 
limitation if a particular institution's costs are found to be 
substantially out of line with other institutions in the same area that 
are similar in size, scope of services, utilization, and other relevant 
factors.
    (3) The determination of reasonable cost of services must be based 
on cost related to the care of Medicare beneficiaries. Reasonable cost 
includes all necessary and proper expenses incurred in furnishing 
services, such as administrative costs, maintenance costs, and premium 
payments for employee health and pension plans. It includes both direct 
and indirect costs and normal standby costs. However, if the provider's 
operating costs include amounts not related to patient care, 
specifically not reimbursable under the program, or flowing from the 
provision of luxury items or services (that is, those items or services 
substantially in excess of or more expensive than those generally 
considered necessary for the provision of needed health services), such 
amounts will not be allowable. The reasonable cost basis of 
reimbursement contemplates that the providers of services would be 
reimbursed the actual costs of providing quality care however widely the 
actual costs may vary from provider to provider and from time to time 
for the same provider.

<R05>
Sec. 413.13  Amount of payment if customary charges for services furnished are less than reasonable costs.

    (a) Definitions. As used in this section--
    Fair compensation means, for the purpose of providers that meet the 
nominal charge provisions in paragraph (f) of this section, the 
reasonable cost of covered services furnished to beneficiaries.
    New provider means a provider that has operated as the type of 
facility for which it has been approved for participation in the 
Medicare program (for example, as a SNF or an HHA) under present and 
previous ownership for less than three full years.
    Provider with a significant portion of low-income patients means a 
nonpublic provider whose charges are 60 percent or less of the 
reasonable cost represented by the charges, and that demonstrates, as 
required under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, that its charges 
are less than costs because its customary practice is to charge patients 
based on their ability to pay.
    Public provider means a provider operated by a Federal, State, 
county, city, or other local government agency or instrumentality.
    (b) Application of the principle of lesser of costs or charges--(1) 
General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, 
effective with cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 
1974, hospitals, SNFs, HHAs, OPTs, and CMHCs but only for purposes of 
providing partial hospitalization services, are paid the lesser of the 
reasonable cost (as described in paragaraph (d) of this section) of 
covered services furnished to beneficiaries or the customary charges (as 
defined in paragraph (e) of this section) made by the provider for the 
same services. The carryover of unreimbursed reasonable costs from 
previous cost reporting periods is recognized, in accordance with the 
provisions of paragraph (h) of this section.
    (2) Example. A provider's reasonable cost for covered services 
furnished to Medicare beneficiaries during a cost reporting period is 
$125,000. The customary charges to those beneficiaries for these 
services is $110,000. The provider is to be reimbursed $110,000 less 
deductible and coinsurance amounts that the beneficiaries are charged.
    (c) Providers and services not subject to the principle--(1) 
Providers--(i) CORFs. Payment to CORFs is based on the reasonable cost 
of the services.
    (ii) Public providers. Public providers furnishing services free of 
charge or at a nominal charge (as specified in paragraph (f) of this 
section) are paid fair compensation for services furnished to 
beneficiaries.

[[Page 369]]

    (iii) Providers furnishing services to a significant portion of low-
income patients. Effective with cost reporting periods beginning on or 
after October 1, 1984, a provider furnishing services at a nominal 
charge (as specified in paragraph (f) of this section) is paid fair 
compensation, upon request, for services furnished to beneficiaries if 
the provider can demonstrate to its intermediary that a significant 
portion of its patients are low income and that its charges are less 
than costs because its customary practice is to charge patients based on 
their ability to pay.
    (2) Services--(i) Part A inpatient hospital services. The lesser of 
costs or charges principle does not apply to Part A inpatient hospital 
services subject to--
    (A) The rate-of-increase limits under Sec. 413.40, effective with 
cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1982; or
    (B) The prospective payment system under Part 412 of this chapter, 
effective with cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 
1983.
    (ii) Special rule for facility services related to ambulatory 
surgical procedures performed in outpatient hospital departments. 
Effective for hospitals with cost reporting periods beginning on or 
after October 1, 1987, reasonable costs and customary charges for those 
services relating to ambulatory surgical procedures that are subject to 
the payment methodology described in Sec. 413.118 are aggregated and 
treated separately from all other hospital costs and charges incurred 
during the cost reporting period.
    (iii) Durable medical equipment furnished by HHAs--(A) General. 
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, for 
durable medical equipment furnished by an HHA as a home health service 
on or after July 18, 1984, the HHA is paid the lesser of the reasonable 
cost of the equipment or the customary charges (less a 20 percent 
coinsurance as provided in section 1866(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act), not to 
exceed 80 percent of the reasonable cost of the equipment. The lesser of 
cost or charges determination for durable medical equipment is made 
separately from all other items or services furnished in an HHA 
regardless of whether the equipment is furnished under Part A or Part B.
    (B) HHAs meeting the nominal charge provisions. A public HHA, or an 
HHA that demonstrates that a significant portion of its patients are 
low-income patients under the nominal charge provisions, as provided in 
paragraph (f)(2) of this section, are paid 80 percent of fair 
compensation for durable medical equipment furnished as a home health 
service on or after July 18, 1984.
    (3) Hospital outpatient radiology services. The reasonable costs and 
customary charges for hospital outpatient radiology services furnished 
on or after October 1, 1988, that are subject to the payment method 
described in Sec. 413.122, are aggregated and treated separately from 
all other hospital costs and charges incurred during the cost reporting 
period.
    (4) Other diagnostic procedures performed by a hospital on an 
outpatient basis. The reasonable costs and customary charges for other 
diagnostic procedures identified by HCFA, that are performed on an 
outpatient basis by a hospital on or after October 1, 1989, and that are 
subject to the payment method described in Sec. 413.122, are aggregated 
and treated separately from all other hospital costs or charges incurred 
during the cost reporting period.
    (d) Exclusions from reasonable cost. For purposes of comparison with 
customary charges under this section, reasonable cost does not include--
    (1) Payments made to a provider as reimbursement for bad debts 
arising from noncollection of Medicare deductible and coinsurance 
amounts (Sec. 413.80);
    (2) Amounts that represent the recovery of excess depreciation 
resulting from termination in the Medicare program or a decrease in 
Medicare utilization (Sec. 413.134(d)(3)) applicable to prior cost 
reporting periods;
    (3) Amounts that result from a disposition of depreciable assets 
(Sec. 413.134(f)), applicable to prior cost reporting periods;
    (4) Payments to funds for the donated services of teaching 
physicians (Sec. 413.85); and
    (5) Graduate medical education costs for cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after July 1, 1985.

[[Page 370]]

    (e) Customary charges--(1) General. As used in this paragraph (e), 
customary charges means the charges for services, as defined in 
Sec. 413.53(b), furnished to beneficiaries. These charges must be 
recorded on all bills submitted for program reimbursement.
    (2) Special situations in which customary charges are reduced. 
Customary charges are reduced in proportion to the ratio of the 
aggregate amount actually collected from charge-paying non-Medicare 
patients to the amount that would have been realized had customary 
charges been paid and the provider--
    (i) Did not actually impose charges in the case of most patients 
liable for payment for its services on a charge basis; or
    (ii) Failed to make a reasonable effort to collect those charges.
    (f) Nominal charges--(1) Cost reporting periods beginning before 
October 1, 1984. Except for durable medical equipment furnished by HHAs 
as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, if a public 
provider's total charges, for cost reporting periods beginning before 
October 1, 1984, are less than one-half of the reasonable cost of 
services or items represented by these charges, then the provider is 
reimbursed fair compensation.
    (2) Cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1984. 
For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1984, the 
following provisions apply in determining nominal charges:
    (i) Reimbursement of fair compensation. Except for the limitations 
on reimbursement for durable medical equipment furnished by HHAs as 
provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, public providers, and 
providers with a significant portion of low-income patients that request 
payment under this paragraph are reimbursed fair compensation if total 
charges are 60 percent or less of the reasonable cost of services or 
items represented by these charges.
    (ii) Separate determination of nominal charges. Except as provided 
in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, the determination of nominal 
charges, which is based on charges actually billed to charge-paying, 
non-Medicare patients, is made separately with respect to inpatient and 
outpatient services (other than clinical diagnostic laboratory tests 
that are paid under section 1833(h) of the Act).
    (iii) Determination of nominal charges in special situations. (A) 
For providers that have a sliding scale or discounted schedule of 
charges based on patients' ability to pay, the determination of nominal 
charges is based on charges billed to all charge-paying patients. This 
determination is made using the ratio of sliding scale or discounted 
charges to the provider's full customary charges. For determining 
nominal charges, the ratio is applied to the provider's Medicare charges 
to equate those charges to customary charges.
    (B) For HHAs, the determination of nominal charges for all items and 
services other than durable medical equipment is made on an aggregate 
basis. The nominal charge determination for durable medical equipment is 
made separately from other items or services furnished by HHAs.
    (C) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1985, 
graduate medical education payments (or a provider's graduate medical 
education reasonable costs if supported by appropriate data) are 
included in reasonable costs when making the nominal charge 
determination.
    (g) The aggregation method--(1) Cost reporting periods beginning 
before October 1, 1984--Application. In comparing costs and charges 
under the lesser of costs or charges principle for cost reporting 
periods beginning before October 1, 1984, the reasonable cost for items 
and services and the customary charges for those same items and services 
are to be aggregated (that is, totalled and compared) without regard to 
whether the services are reimbursable under Part A or Part B of 
Medicare. This aggregation method is to be applied after the provider's 
charges and costs have been adjusted to exclude the amounts described in 
paragraph (d) of this section and to exclude--
    (i) Any amounts attributable to physician services not reimbursable 
to the provider on a reasonable cost basis as described in Secs. 415.55 
through 415.70 of this chapter; and

[[Page 371]]

    (ii) All costs and charges for noncovered provider services.
    (2) Cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1984. 
Effective with cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 
1984, the aggregation method used for computing the lesser of costs or 
charges, as set forth in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, may not be 
used. For covered items and services furnished during these periods, 
total reasonable cost of covered items and services is compared with 
total customary charges for those items and services, separately for 
Part A and for Part B.
    (h) Accumulation of unreimbursed costs and carryover to subsequent 
periods--(1) General rule. A provider whose charges are lower than its 
reasonable cost for those services in any cost reporting period 
beginning on or after January 1, 1974 but before April 28, 1988, may 
carry forward costs that are unreimbursed under paragraph (b) of this 
section for the two succeeding cost reporting periods. However, no 
recovery may be made in any period in which costs are unreimbursed 
because a provider's costs exceed the limitations on reimbursable costs 
(Sec. 413.30) or the ceiling on the rate of hospital cost increases 
(Sec. 413.40).
    (2) Reimbursement as a result of carryover. The provider is 
reimbursed for the costs that are carried forward to a succeeding cost 
reporting period--
    (i) If total charges for services provided in that subsequent period 
exceed the total reasonable cost of the services; and
    (ii) To the extent that accumulation of the costs being carried 
forward and the costs for the services provided in that subsequent 
period do not exceed the customary charges for those services.
    (3) Two succeeding periods less than 24 months. If the two 
succeeding cost reporting periods are less than 24 full calendar months, 
the provider may carry forward the unreimbursed costs for one additional 
cost reporting period.
    (4) Example. In the cost reporting period ending September 30, 1982, 
a provider's reasonable costs were $100,000. The provider's customary 
charges for those services were $90,000. The provider is reimbursed 
$90,000 less any deductible and coinsurance amounts but is permitted to 
carry forward the unreimbursed reasonable costs of $10,000 for the next 
two succeeding cost reporting periods. If, in the cost reporting period 
ending September 30, 1983, customary charges to beneficiaries exceeded 
the reasonable costs for those services by $10,000 or more, and the 
provider had no costs unreimbursed under Sec. 413.30 or Sec. 413.40, the 
provider would recover the entire $10,000 previously not reimbursed. If, 
however, beneficiary charges for that cost reporting period exceeded 
costs by only $8,000, this amount ($8,000) would be added to the 
provider's reimbursable costs for this period. The balance of the 
unreimbursed amount ($2,000) would be carried forward to the next cost 
reporting period.
    (5) New providers. (i) General rule. A new provider whose cost 
reporting period begins before April 28, 1988, may carry forward costs 
that are unreimbursed from previous periods, as described in paragraph 
(b) of this section, during a provider's base period. The base period 
includes any cost reporting period beginning on or after January 1, 
1974, and ending on or before the last day of its third year of 
operation. The unreimbursed costs may be carried forward for the five 
succeeding cost reporting periods. However, no recovery may be made in 
any period in which costs are unreimbursed because a provider's costs 
exceed the limitations on reimbursable costs (Sec. 413.30) or the 
ceiling on the rate of hospital cost increases (Sec. 413.40).
    (ii) Reimbursement as a result of carryover. The new provider is 
reimbursed for the costs that are carried forward to a succeeding cost 
reporting period--
    (A) If total charges for the services provided in that subsequent 
period exceed the total reasonable cost of the services; and
    (B) To the extent that accumulation of the costs being carried 
forward and the costs for the services provided in that subsequent 
period do not exceed the customary charges for those services.
    (iii) Five succeeding periods less than 60 months. If the five 
succeeding cost reporting periods are less than 60 full calendar months, 
the provider may carry

[[Page 372]]

forward the unreimbursed costs for one additional cost reporting period.
    (iv) Example. A provider begins its operations on March 5, 1972. 
However, it begins to participate in the Medicare program as of January 
1, 1973, and reports on a calendar year basis. Because the provider 
would be subject to the lesser of cost or charges principle for its cost 
reporting period beginning with January 1, 1974, it would be permitted 
to accumulate any unreimbursed costs (excess of costs over its charges) 
incurred during this reporting period. Therefore, because this cost 
reporting period ends before the end of the third year of operation, its 
carryover period would be the succeeding five cost reporting periods 
ending with December 31, 1979. If this provider had begun its operation 
on July 1, 1973, and become a participating provider as of the same date 
(with a fiscal year ending June 30), it would have been able to 
accumulate any unreimbursed costs for the two cost reporting periods 
ending June 30, 1975, and June 30, 1976. Its carryover period would then 
be the five cost reporting periods ending no later than June 30, 1981, 
in the case of costs unreimbursed in either of the reporting periods 
ending June 30, 1975, or June 30, 1976.

Sec. 413.17  Cost to related organizations.

    (a) Principle. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, 
costs applicable to services, facilities, and supplies furnished to the 
provider by organizations related to the provider by common ownership or 
control are includable in the allowable cost of the provider at the cost 
to the related organization. However, such cost must not exceed the 
price of comparable services, facilities, or supplies that could be 
purchased elsewhere.
    (b) Definitions. (1) Related to the provider. Related to the 
provider means that the provider to a significant extent is associated 
or affiliated with or has control of or is controlled by the 
organization furnishing the services, facilities, or supplies.
    (2) Common ownership. Common ownership exists if an individual or 
individuals possess significant ownership or equity in the provider and 
the institution or organization serving the provider.
    (3) Control. Control exists if an individual or an organization has 
the power, directly or indirectly, significantly to influence or direct 
the actions or policies of an organization or institution.
    (c) Application. (1) Individuals and organizations associate with 
others for various reasons and by various means. Some deem it 
appropriate to do so to assure a steady flow of supplies or services, to 
reduce competition, to gain a tax advantage, to extend influence, and 
for other reasons. These goals may be accomplished by means of ownership 
or control, by financial assistance, by management assistance, and other 
ways.
    (2) If the provider obtains items of services, facilities, or 
supplies from an organization, even though it is a separate legal 
entity, and the organization is owned or controlled by the owner(s) of 
the provider, in effect the items are obtained from itself. An example 
would be a corporation building a hospital or a nursing home and then 
leasing it to another corporation controlled by the owner. Therefore, 
reimbursable cost should include the costs for these items at the cost 
to the supplying organization. However, if the price in the open market 
for comparable services, facilities, or supplies is lower than the cost 
to the supplier, the allowable cost to the provider may not exceed the 
market price.
    (d) Exception. (1) An exception is provided to this general 
principle if the provider demonstrates by convincing evidence to the 
satisfaction of the fiscal intermediary (or, if the provider has not 
nominated a fiscal intermediary, HCFA), that--
    (i) The supplying organization is a bona fide separate organization;
    (ii) A substantial part of its business activity of the type carried 
on with the provider is transacted with others than the provider and 
organizations related to the supplier by common ownership

[[Page 373]]

or control and there is an open, competitive market for the type of 
services, facilities, or supplies furnished by the organization;
    (iii) The services, facilities, or supplies are those that commonly 
are obtained by institutions such as the provider from other 
organizations and are not a basic element of patient care ordinarily 
furnished directly to patients by such institutions; and
    (iv) The charge to the provider is in line with the charge for such 
services, facilities, or supplies in the open market and no more than 
the charge made under comparable circumstances to others by the 
organization for such services, facilities, or supplies.
    (2) In such cases, the charge by the supplier to the provider for 
such services, facilities, or supplies is allowable as cost.

                Subpart B--Accounting Records and Reports


<R05>
Sec. 413.20  Financial data and reports.

    (a) General. The principles of cost reimbursement require that 
providers maintain sufficient financial records and statistical data for 
proper determination of costs payable under the program. Standardized 
definitions, accounting, statistics, and reporting practices that are 
widely accepted in the hospital and related fields are followed. Changes 
in these practices and systems will not be required in order to 
determine costs payable under the principles of reimbursement. 
Essentially the methods of determining costs payable under Medicare 
involve making use of data available from the institution's basis 
accounts, as usually maintained, to arrive at equitable and proper 
payment for services to beneficiaries.
    (b) Frequency of cost reports. Cost reports are required from 
providers on an annual basis with reporting periods based on the 
provider's accounting year. In the interpretation and application of the 
principles of reimbursement, the fiscal intermediaries will be an 
important source of consultative assistance to providers and will be 
available to deal with questions and problems on a day-to-day basis.
    (c) Recordkeeping requirements for new providers. A newly 
participating provider of services (as defined in Sec. 400.202 of this 
chapter) must make available to its selected intermediary for 
examination its fiscal and other records for the purpose of determining 
such provider's ongoing recordkeeping capability and inform the 
intermediary of the date its initial Medicare cost reporting period 
ends. This examination is intended to assure that--
    (1) The provider has an adequate ongoing system for furnishing the 
records needed to provide accurate cost data and other information 
capable of verification by qualified auditors and adequate for cost 
reporting purposes under section 1815 of the Act; and
    (2) No financial arrangements exist that will thwart the commitment 
of the Medicare program to reimburse providers the reasonable cost of 
services furnished beneficiaries. The data and information to be 
examined include cost, revenue, statistical, and other information 
pertinent to reimbursement including, but not limited to, that described 
in paragraph (d) of this section and in Sec. 413.24.
    (d) Continuing provider recordkeeping requirements. (1) The provider 
must furnish such information to the intermediary as may be necessary 
to--
    (i) Assure proper payment by the program, including the extent to 
which there is any common ownership or control (as described in 
Sec. 413.17(b)(2) and (3)) between providers or other organizations, and 
as may be needed to identify the parties responsible for submitting 
program cost reports;
    (ii) Receive program payments; and
    (iii) Satisfy program overpayment determinations.
    (2) The provider must permit the intermediary to examine such 
records and documents as are necessary to ascertain information 
pertinent to the determination of the proper amount of program payments 
due. These records include, but are not limited to, matters pertaining 
to--
    (i) Provider ownership, organization, and operation;
    (ii) Fiscal, medical, and other recordkeeping systems;
    (iii) Federal income tax status;

[[Page 374]]

    (iv) Asset acquisition, lease, sale, or other action;
    (v) Franchise or management arrangements;
    (vi) Patient service charge schedules;
    (vii) Costs of operation;
    (viii) Amounts of income received by source and purpose; and
    (ix) Flow of funds and working capital.
    (3) The provider, upon request, must furnish the intermediary copies 
of patient service charge schedules and changes thereto as they are put 
into effect. The intermediary will evaluate such charge schedules to 
determine the extent to which they may be used for determining program 
payment.
    (e) Suspension of program payments to a provider. If an intermediary 
determines that a provider does not maintain or no longer maintains 
adequate records for the determination of reasonable cost under the 
Medicare program, payments to such provider will be suspended until the 
intermediary is assured that adequate records are maintained. Before 
suspending payments to a provider, the intermediary will, in accordance 
with the provisions in Sec. 405.372(a) of this chapter, send written 
notice to such provider of its intent to suspend payments. The notice 
will explain the basis for the intermediary's determination with respect 
to the provider's records and will identify the provider's recordkeeping 
deficiencies. The provider must be given the opportunity, in accordance 
with Sec. 405.372(b) of this chapter, to submit a statement (including 
any pertinent evidence) as to why the suspension must not be put into 
effect.

[51 FR 34793, Sept. 30, 1986, as amended at 61 FR 63749, Dec. 2, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 413.24  Adequate cost data and cost finding.

    (a) Principle. Providers receiving payment on the basis of 
reimbursable cost must provide adequate cost data. This must be based on 
their financial and statistical records which must be capable of 
verification by qualified auditors. The cost data must be based on an 
approved method of cost finding and on the accrual basis of accounting.

However, if governmental institutions operate on a cash basis of 
accounting, cost data based on such basis of accounting will be 
acceptable, subject to appropriate treatment of capital expenditures.
    (b) Definitions. (1) Cost finding. Cost finding is the process of 
recasting the data derived from the accounts ordinarily kept by a 
provider to ascertain costs of the various types of services furnished. 
It is the determination of these costs by the allocation of direct costs 
and proration of indirect costs.
    (2) Accrual basis of accounting. As used in this part, the term 
accrual basis of accounting means that revenue is reported in the period 
in which it is earned, regardless of when it is collected; and an 
expense is reported in the period in which it is incurred, regardless of 
when it is paid. (See Sec. 413.100 regarding limitations on allowable 
accrued costs in situations in which the related liabilities are not 
liquidated timely.)
    (c) Adequacy of cost information. Adequate cost information must be 
obtained from the provider's records to support payments made for 
services furnished to beneficiaries. The requirement of adequacy of data 
implies that the data be accurate and in sufficient detail to accomplish 
the purposes for which it is intended. Adequate data capable of being 
audited is consistent with good business concepts and effective and 
efficient management of any organization, whether it is operated for 
profit or on a nonprofit basis. It is a reasonable expectation on the 
part of any agency paying for services on a cost-reimbursement basis. In 
order to provide the required cost data and not impair comparability, 
financial and statistical records should be maintained in a manner 
consistent from one period to another. However, a proper regard for 
consistency need not preclude a desirable change in accounting 
procedures if there is reason to effect such change.
    (d) Cost finding methods. After the close of the accounting period, 
providers must use one of the following methods of cost finding to 
determine the actual costs of services furnished during that period. 
(These provisions do not apply to SNFs that elect and qualify

[[Page 375]]

for prospectively determined payment rates under subpart I of this part 
for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1986. For 
the special rules that are applicable to those SNFs, see Sec. 413.321.) 
For cost reporting periods beginning after December 31, 1971, providers 
using the departmental method of cost apportionment must use the step-
down method described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section or an ``other 
method'' described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. For cost 
reporting periods beginning after December 31, 1971, providers using the 
combination method of cost apportionment must use the modified cost 
finding method described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Effective 
for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1980, HHAs 
not based in hospitals or SNFs must use the step-down method described 
in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. (HHAs based in hospitals or SNFs 
must use the method applicable to the parent institution.) However, an 
HHA not based in a hospital or SNF that received less than $35,000 in 
Medicare payment for the immediately preceding cost reporting period, 
and for whom this payment represented less than 50 percent of the total 
operating cost of the agency, may use a simplified version of the step-
down method, as specified in instructions for the cost report issued by 
HCFA.
    (1) Step-down Method. This method recognizes that services furnished 
by certain nonrevenue-producing departments or centers are utilized by 
certain other nonrevenue-producing centers as well as by the revenue-
producing centers. All costs of nonrevenue-producing centers are 
allocated to all centers that they serve, regardless of whether or not 
these centers produce revenue. The cost of the nonrevenue-producing 
center serving the greatest number of other centers, while receiving 
benefits from the least number of centers, is apportioned first. 
Following the apportionment of the cost of the nonrevenue-producing 
center, that center will be considered ``closed'' and no further costs 
are apportioned to that center. This applies even though it may have 
received some service from a center whose cost is apportioned later. 
Generally, if two centers furnish services to an equal number of centers 
while receiving benefits from an equal number, that center which has the 
greatest amount of expense should be allocated first.
    (2) Other methods. (i) The double-apportionment method. The double-
apportionment method may be used by a provider upon approval of the 
intermediary. This method also recognizes that the nonrevenue-producing 
departments or centers furnish services to other nonrevenue-producing 
centers as well as to revenue-producing centers. A preliminary 
allocation of the costs of non-revenue-producing centers is made. These 
centers or departments are not ``closed'' after this preliminary 
allocation. Instead, they remain ``open,'' accumulating a portion of the 
costs of all other centers from which services are received. Thus, after 
the first or preliminary allocation, some costs will remain in each 
center representing services received from other centers. The first or 
preliminary allocation is followed by a second or final apportionment of 
expenses involving the allocation of all costs remaining in the 
nonrevenue-producing functions directly to revenue-producing centers.
    (ii) More sophisticated methods. A more sophisticated method 
designed to allocate costs more accurately may be used by the provider 
upon approval of the intermediary. However, having elected to use the 
double-apportionment method, the provider may not thereafter use the 
step-down method without approval of the intermediary. Written request 
for the approval must be made on a prospective basis and must be 
submitted before the end of the fourth month of the prospective 
reporting period. Likewise, once having elected to use a more 
sophisticated method, the provider may not thereafter use either the 
double-apportionment or step-down methods without similar request and 
approval.
    (3) Modified cost finding for providers using the Combination Method 
for reporting periods beginning after December 31, 1971. This method 
differs from the step-down method in that services furnished by 
nonrevenue-producing departments or centers are allocated directly to 
revenue-producing departments or centers

[[Page 376]]

even though these services may be utilized by other nonrevenue-producing 
departments or centers. In the application of this method the cost of 
nonrevenue-producing centers having a common basis of allocation are 
combined and the total distributed to revenue-producing centers. All 
nonrevenue-producing centers having significant percentages of cost in 
relation to total costs will be allocated this way. The combined total 
costs of remaining nonrevenue-producing costs centers will be allocated 
to revenue-producing cost centers in the proportion that each bears to 
total costs, direct and indirect, already allocated. The bases which are 
to be used and the centers which are to be combined for allocation are 
not optional but are identified and incorporated in the cost report 
forms developed for this method. Providers using this method must use 
the program cost report forms devised for it. Alternative forms may not 
be used without prior approval by HCFA based upon a written request by 
the provider submitted through the intermediary.
    (4) Temporary method for initial period. If the provider is unable 
to use either cost-finding method when it first participates in the 
program, it may apply to the intermediary for permission to use some 
other acceptable method that would accurately identify costs by 
department or center, and appropriately segregate inpatient and 
outpatient costs. Such other method may be used for cost reports 
covering periods ending before January 1, 1968.
    (5) Simplified optional reimbursement method for small, rural 
hospitals with distinct parts for cost reporting periods beginning on or 
after July 20, 1982. (i) A rural hospital with a Medicare-certified 
distinct part SNF may elect to be reimbursed for services furnished in 
its hospital general routine service area and distinct part SNF using 
the reimbursement method specified in Sec. 413.53 for swing-bed 
hospitals, if it meets the following conditions:
    (A) The institution is located in a rural area as defined in 
Sec. 482.66 of this chapter.
    (B) On the first day of the cost reporting period, the hospital and 
distinct part SNF have fewer than 50 beds in total (with the exception 
of beds for newborns and beds in intensive care type inpatient units).
    (ii) In applying the optional reimbursement method, only those beds 
located in the hospital general routine service area and in the distinct 
part SNF certified by Medicare are combined into a single cost center 
for purposes of cost finding.
    (iii) The reasonable cost of the routine extended care services is 
determined in accordance with Sec. 413.114(c). The reasonable cost of 
the hospital general routine services is determined in accordance with 
Sec. 413.53(a)(2).
    (iv) The hospital must make its election to use the optional swing-
bed reimbursement method in writing to the intermediary before the 
beginning of the hospital's cost reporting year. The hospital must make 
any request to revoke the election in writing before the beginning of 
the affected cost reporting period.
    (v) The intermediary must approve requests to terminate use of the 
optional swing-bed reimbursement method. If a hospital terminates use of 
this optional method, no further elections may be made by the facility 
to use the optional method.
    (e) Accounting basis. The cost data submitted must be based on the 
accrual basis of accounting which is recognized as the most accurate 
basis for determining costs. However, governmental institutions that 
operate on a cash basis of accounting may submit cost data on the cash 
basis subject to appropriate treatment of capital expenditures.
    (f) Cost reports. For cost reporting purposes, the Medicare program 
requires each provider of services to submit periodic reports of its 
operations that generally cover a consecutive 12-month period of the 
provider's operations. Amended cost reports to revise cost report 
information that has been previously submitted by a provider may be 
permitted or required as determined by HCFA.
    (1) Cost reports--Terminated providers and changes of ownership. A 
provider that voluntarily or involuntarily ceases to participate in the 
Medicare program or experiences a change of ownership must file a cost 
report for

[[Page 377]]

that period under the program beginning with the first day not included 
in a previous cost reporting period and ending with the effective date 
of termination of its provider agreement or change of ownership.
    (2) Due dates for cost reports. (i) Cost reports are due on or 
before the last day of the fifth month following the close of the period 
covered by the report. For cost reports ending on a day other than the 
last day of the month, cost reports are due 150 days after the last day 
of the cost reporting period.
    (ii) Extensions of the due date for filing a cost report may be 
granted by the intermediary only when a provider's operations are 
significantly adversely affected due to extraordinary circumstances over 
which the provider has no control, such as flood or fire.
    (3) Changes in cost reporting periods. A provider may change its 
cost reporting period if a change in ownership is experienced or if 
the--
    (i) Provider requests the change in writing from its intermediary;
    (ii) Intermediary receives the request at least 120 days before the 
close of the new reporting period requested by the provider; and
    (iii) Intermediary determines that good cause for the change exists. 
Good cause would not be found to exist if the effect is to change the 
initial date that a hospital would be affected by the rate of increase 
ceiling (see Sec. 413.40), or be paid under the prospective payment 
systems (see part 412 of this chapter).
    (4) Electronic submission of cost reports. (i) As used in this 
paragraph, ``provider'' means a hospital, skilled nursing facility, or 
home health agency.
    (ii) Effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 1989, for hospitals, and cost reporting periods ending on or 
after February 1, 1997, for skilled nursing facilities and home health 
agencies, a provider is required to submit cost reports in a 
standardized electronic format. The provider's electronic program must 
be capable of producing the HCFA standardized output file in a form that 
can be read by the fiscal intermediary's automated system. This 
electronic file, which must contain the input data required to complete 
the cost report and the data required to pass specified edits, is 
forwarded to the fiscal intermediary for processing through its system.
    (iii) The fiscal intermediary stores the provider's as-filed 
electronic cost report and may not alter that file for any reason. The 
fiscal intermediary makes a ``working copy'' of the as-filed electronic 
cost report to be used, as necessary, throughout the settlement process 
(that is, desk review, processing audit adjustments, final settlement, 
etc). The provider's electronic program must be able to disclose if any 
changes have been made to the as-filed electronic cost report after 
acceptance by the intermediary. If the as-filed electronic cost report 
does not pass all specified edits, the fiscal intermediary rejects the 
cost report and returns it to the provider for correction. For purposes 
of the requirements in paragraph (f)(2) of this section concerning due 
dates, an electronic cost report is not considered to be filed until it 
is accepted by the intermediary.
    (iv) Effective for cost reporting periods ending on or after 
September 30, 1994, for hospitals, and cost reporting periods ending on 
or after, February 1, 1997, for skilled nursing facilities and home 
health agencies, a provider must submit a hard copy of a settlement 
summary, a statement of certain worksheet totals found within the 
electronic file, and a statement signed by its administrator or chief 
financial officer certifying the accuracy of the electronic file or the 
manually prepared cost report. During a transition period, skilled 
nursing facilities and home health agencies must submit a hard copy of 
the completed cost report forms in addition to the electronic file. The 
following statement must immediately precede the dated signature of the 
provider's administrator or chief financial officer:

    I hereby certify that I have read the above certification statement 
and that I have examined the accompanying electronically filed or 
manually submitted cost report and the Balance Sheet Statement of 
Revenue and Expenses prepared by ________ (Provider Name(s) and 
Number(s)) for the cost reporting period beginning ________ and ending 
________ and that to the best of my knowledge and belief, this report 
and statement are true, correct, complete and prepared from the books 
and records of the provider in

[[Page 378]]

accordance with applicable instructions, except as noted. I further 
certify that I am familiar with the laws and regulations regarding the 
provision of health care services, and that the services identified in 
this cost report were provided in compliance with such laws and 
regulations.

    (v) A provider may request a delay or waiver of the electronic 
submission requirement in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section if this 
requirement would cause a financial hardship or if the provider 
qualifies as a low or no Medicare utilization provider. The provider 
must submit a written request for delay or waiver with necessary 
supporting documentation to its intermediary no later than 30 days after 
the end of its cost reporting period. The intermediary reviews the 
request and forwards it, with a recommendation for approval or denial, 
to HCFA central office within 30 days of receipt of the request. HCFA 
central office either approves or denies the request and notifies the 
intermediary within 60 days of receipt of the request.
    (5) An acceptable cost report submission is defined as follows:
    (i) All providers--The provider, must complete and submit the 
required cost reporting forms, including all necessary signatures. A 
cost report is rejected for lack of supporting documentation only if it 
does not include the Provider Cost Reimbursement Questionnaire. 
Additionally, a cost report for a teaching hospital is rejected for lack 
of supporting documentation if the cost report does not include a copy 
of the Intern and Resident Information System diskette.
    (ii) For providers that are required to file electronic cost 
reports--In addition to the requirements of paragraphs (f)(4) and 
(f)(5)(i) of this section, the provider must submit its cost reports in 
an electronic cost report format in conformance with the requirements 
contained in the Electronic Cost Report (ECR) Specifications Manual 
(unless the provider has received an exemption from HCFA).
    (iii) The intermediary makes a determination of acceptability within 
30 days of receipt of the provider's cost report. If the cost report is 
considered unacceptable, the intermediary returns the cost report with a 
letter explaining the reasons for the rejection. When the cost report is 
rejected, it is deemed an unacceptable submission and treated as if a 
report had never been filed.
    (g) Exception from full cost reporting for lack of program 
utilization. If a provider does not furnish any covered services to 
Medicare beneficiaries during a cost reporting period, it is not 
required to submit a full cost report. It must, however, submit an 
abbreviated cost report, as prescribed by HCFA.
    (h) Waiver of full or simplified cost reporting for low program 
utilization. (1) If the provider has had low utilization of covered 
services by Medicare beneficiaries (as determined by the intermediary) 
and has received correspondingly low interim payments for the cost 
reporting period, the intermediary may waive a full cost report or the 
simplified cost report described in Sec. 413.321 if it decides that it 
can determine, without a full or simplified report, the reasonable cost 
of covered services provided during that period.
    (2) If a full or simplified cost report is waived, the provider must 
submit within the same time period required for full or simplified cost 
reports:
    (i) The cost reporting forms prescribed by HCFA for this situation; 
and
    (ii) Any other financial and statistical data the intermediary 
requires.

<R04>
                 Subpart C--Limits on Cost Reimbursement


<R05>
Sec. 413.30  Limitations on reimbursable costs.

    (a) Introduction. (1) Scope. This section implements section 
1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act, by setting forth the general rules under which 
HCFA may establish limits on provider costs recognized as reasonable in 
determining Medicare program payments, and sections 1861(v)(7)(B) and 
1886(a) of the Act, by setting forth the general rules under which HCFA 
may establish limits on the operating costs of inpatient hospital 
services that are recognized as reasonable in determining Medicare 
program payments. (For cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1,

[[Page 379]]

1983, the operating costs incurred in furnishing inpatient hospital 
services are not subject to the provisions of this section.) This 
section also sets forth rules governing exemptions, exceptions, and 
adjustments to limits established under this section that HCFA may make 
as appropriate in consideration of special needs or situations of 
particular providers.
    (2) General principle. Reimbursable provider costs may not exceed 
the costs estimated by HCFA to be necessary for the efficient delivery 
of needed health services. HCFA may establish estimated cost limits for 
direct or indirect overall costs or for costs of specific items or 
services or groups of items or services. These limits will be imposed 
prospectively and may be calculated on a per admission, per discharge, 
per diem, per visit, or other basis.
    (b) Procedure for establishing limits. (1) In establishing limits 
under this section, HCFA may classify providers by type of provider (for 
example, hospitals, SNFs, and HHAs) and by other factors HCFA finds 
appropriate and practical, including--
    (i) Type of services furnished;
    (ii) Geographical area where services are furnished, allowing for 
grouping of noncontiguous areas having similar demographic and economic 
characteristics;
    (iii) Size of institution;
    (iv) Nature and mix of services furnished; or
    (v) Type and mix of patients treated.
    (2) Estimates of the costs necessary for efficient delivery of 
health services may be based on cost reports or other data providing 
indicators of current costs. Current and past period data will be 
adjusted to arrive at estimated costs for the prospective periods to 
which limits are being applied.
    (3) Prior to the beginning of a cost period to which revised limits 
will be applied, HCFA will publish a notice in the Federal Register, 
establishing cost limits and explaining the basis on which they were 
calculated.
    (4) In establishing limits under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, 
HCFA may find it inappropriate to apply particular limits to a class of 
providers due to the characteristics of the provider class, the data on 
which those limits are based, or the method by which the limits are 
determined. In such cases, HCFA may exclude that class of providers from 
the limits, explaining the basis of the exclusion in the notice setting 
forth the limits for the appropriate cost reporting periods.
    (c) Provider requests regarding applicability of cost limits. A 
provider may request a reclassification, exception, or exemption from 
the cost limits imposed under this section. In addition, a hospital may 
request an adjustment to the cost limits imposed under this section. The 
provider's request must be made to its fiscal intermediary within 180 
days of the date on the intermediary's notice of program reimbursement. 
The intermediary makes a recommendation on the provider's request to 
HCFA, which makes the decision. HCFA responds to the request within 180 
days from the date HCFA receives the request from the intermediary. The 
intermediary notifies the provider of HCFA's decision. The time required 
for HCFA to review the request is considered good cause for the granting 
of an extension of the time limit to apply for a Board review, as 
specified in Sec. 405.1841 of this chapter. HCFA's decision is subject 
to review under subpart R of part 405 of this chapter.
    (d) Reclassification. A provider may obtain a reclassification if it 
can show that its classification is at variance with the criteria 
specified in promulgating the limits.
    (e) Exemptions. Exemptions from the limits imposed under this 
section may be granted to a new provider. A new provider is a provider 
of inpatient services that has operated as the type of provider (or the 
equivalent) for which it is certified for Medicare, under present and 
previous ownership, for less than three full years. An exemption granted 
under this paragraph expires at the end of the provider's first cost 
reporting period beginning at least two years after the provider accepts 
its first patient.
    (f) Exceptions. Limits established under this section may be 
adjusted upward for a provider under the circumstances specified in 
paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(5) of this section. An

[[Page 380]]

adjustment is made only to the extent the costs are reasonable, 
attributable to the circumstances specified, separately identified by 
the provider, and verified by the intermediary.
    (1) Atypical services. The provider can show that the--
    (i) Actual cost of items or services furnished by a provider exceeds 
the applicable limit because such items or services are atypical in 
nature and scope, compared to the items or services generally furnished 
by providers similarly classified; and
    (ii) Atypical items or services are furnished because of the special 
needs of the patients treated and are necessary in the efficient 
delivery of needed health care.
    (2) Extraordinary circumstances. The provider can show that it 
incurred higher costs due to extraordinary circumstances beyond its 
control. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, strikes, 
fire, earthquake, flood, or similar unusual occurrences with substantial 
cost effects.
    (3) Providers in areas with fluctuating populations. (i) The 
provider is located in an area (for example, a resort area) that has a 
population that varies significantly during the year;
    (ii) The appropriate health planning agency has determined that the 
area does not have a surplus of beds and similar services and has 
certified that the beds and services made available by the provider are 
necessary; and
    (iii) The provider meets occupancy standards established by the 
Secretary.
    (4) Medical and paramedical education. The provider can demonstrate 
that, if compared to other providers in its group, it incurs increased 
costs for items or services covered by limits under this section because 
of its operation of an approved education program specified in 
Sec. 413.85.
    (5) Unusual labor costs. The provider has a percentage of labor 
costs that varies more than 10 percent from that included in the 
promulgation of the limits.
    (g) Operational review of providers receiving an exception. Any 
provider that applies for an exception to the limits established under 
paragraph (f) of this section must agree to an operational review at the 
discretion of HCFA. The findings from any such review may be the basis 
for recommendations for improvements in the efficiency and economy of 
the provider's operations. If such recommendations are made, any future 
exceptions shall be contingent on the provider's implementation of these 
recommendations.
    (h) Adjustments. For cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 1982 and before October 1, 1983, HCFA may adjust the amount 
of a hospital's inpatient operating costs to take into account factors 
that could result in a significant distortion in the operating costs of 
inpatient hospital services. Such factors could include a decrease in 
the inpatient services that a hospital provides that are customarily 
provided directly by similar hospitals, or the manipulation of 
discharges to increase reimbursement. A decrease in inpatient services 
could result from changes that include, but are not limited to, such 
actions as closing a special care unit or changing the arrangements 
under which such services may be furnished, such as leasing a 
department.

Sec. 413.35  Limitations on coverage of costs: Charges to beneficiaries if cost limits are applied to services.

    (a) Principle. A provider of services that customarily furnishes an 
individual items or services that are more expensive than the items or 
services determined to be necessary in the efficient delivery of needed 
health services described in Sec. 413.30, may charge an individual 
entitled to benefits under Medicare for such more expensive items or 
services even though not requested by the individual. The charge, 
however, may not exceed the amount by which the cost of (or, if less, 
the customary charges for) such more expensive items or services 
furnished by such provider in the second cost reporting period 
immediately preceding the cost reporting period in which such charges 
are imposed exceeds the applicable limit imposed under the provisions of 
Sec. 413.30. This charge may be made only if--

[[Page 381]]

    (1) The intermediary determines that the charges have been 
calculated properly in accordance with the provisions of this section;
    (2) The services are not emergency services as defined in paragraph 
(d) of this section;
    (3) The admitting physician has no direct or indirect financial 
interest in such provider;
    (4) HCFA has provided notice to the public through notice in a 
newspaper of general circulation servicing the provider's locality and 
such other notice as the Secretary may require, of any charges the 
provider is authorized to impose on individuals entitled to benefits 
under Medicare on account of costs in excess of the costs determined to 
be necessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services under 
Medicare; and
    (5) The provider has, in the manner described in paragraph (e) of 
this section, identified such charges to such individual or person 
acting on his behalf as charges to meet the costs in excess of the costs 
determined to be necessary in the efficient delivery of needed health 
services under Medicare.
    (b) Provider request to charge beneficiaries for costs in excess of 
limits. (1) If a provider's actual costs (or, if less, the customary 
charges) in the second preceding cost period exceed the prospective 
limits established for such costs, the intermediary will, at the 
provider's request, validate in advance the charges that may be made to 
the beneficiaries for the excess.
    (2) If a provider does not have a second preceding cost period and 
is a new provider as defined in Sec. 413.30(e), the provider, subject to 
validation by the intermediary, will estimate the current cost of the 
service to which a limit is being applied. Such amount will be adjusted 
to an amount equivalent to costs in the second preceding year by use of 
a factor to be developed based on estimates of cost increases during the 
preceding two years and published by SSA or HCFA. The amount thus 
derived will be used in lieu of the second preceding cost period amount 
in determining the charge to the beneficiary.
    (3) To obtain consideration of such a request, the provider must 
submit to the intermediary a statement indicating the chagre for which 
it is seeking validation and providing the data and method used to 
determine the amount. Such statement should include the--
    (i) Provider's name and number;
    (ii) Identity of class and prospective cost limit for the class in 
which the provider has been included;
    (iii) Amount of charge and cost period in which the charge is to be 
imposed;
    (iv) Cost and customary charge for items and services furnished to 
beneficiaries; and
    (v) Cost period ending date of the second reporting period 
immediately preceding the cost period in which the charge is to be 
imposed. The intermediary may request such additional information as it 
finds necessary with respect to the request.
    (c) Provider charges. (1) Establishing the charges. If the actual 
cost incurred (or, if less, the customary charges) in the prior period 
determined under paragraph (a) of this section exceeds the limits 
applicable to the pertinent period, the provider may charge the 
beneficiary to the extent costs in the second preceding cost reporting 
period (or the equivalent when there is no second preceding period) 
exceed the current cost limits. (Data from the most recently submitted 
appropriate cost report will be used in determining the actual cost.) 
For example, if a limit of $58 per day is applied to the cost of general 
routine services for the provider's cost reporting period starting in 
calendar year 1975 and if the provider's actual general routine cost in 
the second preceding reporting period, that is, the reporting period 
starting in calendar year 1973, was $60 per day, the provider (after 
first having obtained intermediary validation and subject to the 
considerations and requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section) may charge Medicare Part A beneficiaries up to $2 per day for 
general routine services.
    (2) Adjusting cost. Program reimbursement for the costs to which 
limits imposed under Sec. 413.30 are applied in any cost reporting 
period will not exceed the lesser of the provider's actual cost or the 
limits imposed under Sec. 413.30. If program reimbursement for items or

[[Page 382]]

services to which such limits are applied plus the charges to 
beneficiaries for such items or services imposed under this section 
exceed the provider's actual cost for such items or services, program 
payment to the provider will be reduced to the extent program payment 
plus charges to the beneficiaries exceed actual cost. If the provider's 
actual cost for general routine services in 1975 was $57,000, the cost 
limit was $58,000, and billed charges to Medicare Part A beneficiaries 
were $2,000, the provider would receive $55,000 from the program 
($57,000 actual cost minus the $2,000 in charges to the beneficiaries).
    (d) Definition of emergency services. For purposes of paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, emergency services are those hospital services 
that are necessary to prevent the death or serious impairment of the 
health of the individual, and which, because of the threat to the life 
or health of the individual, necessitate the use of the most accessible 
hospital (as determined under Sec. 424.106 of this chapter) available 
and equipped to furnish such services. If an individual has been 
admitted to such hospital as an inpatient because of an emergency, the 
emergency will be deemed to continue until it is safe from a medical 
standpoint to move the individual to another hospital or other 
institution or to discharge him.
    (e) Identification of charges to individual. For purposes of 
paragraph (a)(5) of this section, a provider must give or send to the 
individual or his representative, a schedule of all items and services 
that the individual might need and for which the provider imposes 
charges under this section, and the charge for each. Such schedule must 
specify that the charges are necessary to meet the costs in excess of 
the costs determined to be necessary in the efficient delivery of needed 
health services under Medicare and include such other information as 
HCFA considers necessary to protect the individual's rights under this 
section. The provider, in arranging for the individual's admission, 
first service, or start of care, must give or send this schedule to the 
individual or his representative when arrangements are being made for 
such services or if this is not feasible, as soon thereafter as is 
practicable but no later than at the initiation of services.

<R05>
Sec. 413.40  Ceiling on the rate of increase in hospital inpatient costs.

    (a) Introduction. (1) Scope. This section implements section 1886(b) 
of the Act, establishing a ceiling on the rate of increase in operating 
costs per case for hospital inpatient services furnished to Medicare 
beneficiaries that will be recognized as reasonable for purposes of 
determining the amount of Medicare payment. This rate-of-increase 
ceiling applies to hospital cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 1982. This section also sets forth rules governing exemptions 
from and adjustments to the ceiling.
    (2) Applicability. (i) This section is not applicable to--
    (A) Hospitals reimbursed in accordance with section 1814(b)(3) of 
the Act or under State reimbursement control systems that have been 
approved under section 1886(c) of the Act and subpart C of part 403 of 
this chapter; or
    (B) Hospitals that are paid under the prospective payment systems 
for inpatient hospital services in accordance with section 1886 (d) and 
(g) of the Act and part 412 of this chapter.
    (ii) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 
1983, this section applies to hospitals excluded from the prospective 
payment system in accordance with Sec. 412.23 of this chapter, and 
psychiatric and rehabilitation units excluded from the prospective 
payment system in accordance with Secs. 412.25 through 412.30 of this 
chapter.
    (3) Definitions. As used in this section--
    Ceiling is the aggregate upper limit on the amount of a hospital's 
net Medicare inpatient operating costs that the program will recognize 
for payment purposes. For each cost reporting period, the ceiling is 
determined by multiplying the updated target amount, as defined in this 
paragraph, for that period by the number of Medicare discharges during 
that period.
    Date of discharge is the earliest of the following dates:

[[Page 383]]

    (A) The date the patient has exhausted Medicare Part A hospital 
inpatient benefits (including the election to use lifetime reserve days) 
during his or her spell of illness.
    (B) The date the patient is formally released as specified in 
Sec. 412.4(a)(1) of this chapter.
    (C) The date the patient is transferred to another facility.
    (D) The date the patient dies.
    Market basket index is HCFA's projection of the annual percentage 
increase in hospital inpatient operating costs. The market basket index 
is a wage and price index that incorporates weighted indicators of 
changes in wages and prices that are representative of the mix of goods 
and services included in the most common categories of hospital 
inpatient operating costs subject to the ceiling, as described in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    Net inpatient operating costs include the costs of certain 
preadmission services as specified in Sec. 413.40(c)(2), the costs of 
routine services, ancillary services, and intensive care services (as 
defined in Sec. 413.53(b)) incurred by a hospital in furnishing covered 
inpatient services to Medicare beneficiaries. Net inpatient operating 
costs exclude capital-related costs as described in Sec. 413.130, the 
costs of approved medical education programs as described in 
Secs. 413.85 and 413.86, and heart, kidney, and liver acquisition costs 
incurred by approved transplantation centers. These costs are identified 
and excluded from inpatient operating costs before the application of 
the ceiling.
    Rate-of-increase percentage is the percentage by which each 
hospital's target amount from the preceding Federal fiscal year is 
increased.
    Target amount is the per discharge (case) limitation, derived from 
the hospital's allowable net Medicare inpatient operating costs in the 
hospital's base year, and updated for each subsequent hospital cost 
reporting period by the appropriate annual rate-of-increase percentage.
    Update adjustment percentage is the percentage by which a hospital's 
allowable inpatient operating service costs for the 12-month cost 
reporting period beginning in Federal fiscal year 1990 exceeds the 
hospital's ceiling for that period.
    Update factor is the decimal equivalent of the rate-of-increase 
percentage. The update factor is the value by which a hospital's target 
amount for the preceding year is multiplied in order to determine the 
target amount for the following year. For example, if the rate-of-
increase percentage for a year is 2.7 percent, the update factor for 
that year is 1.027.
    (b) Cost reporting periods subject to the rate-of-increase ceiling. 
(1) Base period. Each hospital's target amount is based on its allowable 
net inpatient operating costs per case from the cost reporting period of 
at least 12 months immediately preceding the first cost reporting period 
subject to the rate-of-increase ceiling established under this section. 
If the immediately preceding cost reporting period is a short reporting 
period (fewer than 12 months), the first period of at least 12 months 
subsequent to that short period is the base period.
    (i) The target amount established under this provision remains 
applicable to a hospital or excluded hospital unit, as described in 
Secs. 412.25 through 412.30 of this chapter, despite intervening cost 
reporting periods during which the hospital or excluded hospital unit is 
not subject to the ceiling as a result of other provisions of the law or 
regulations, or nonparticipation in the Medicare program, unless the 
hospital or excluded hospital unit qualifies as a new hospital or 
excluded part hospital unit under the provisions of paragraph (f) of 
this section.
    (ii) The base period for a newly established excluded unit is the 
first cost reporting period of at least 12 months following the unit's 
certification to participate in the Medicare program.
    (iii) When the operational structure of a hospital or unit changes 
(that is, a freestanding hospital becomes a unit or vice versa) the base 
period is the first cost reporting period of at least 12 months 
effective with the revised Medicare certification classification.
    (iv) Request for rebased target amount for the cost reporting period 
beginning on or after October 1, 1997 and on or before September 30, 
1998. Except for qualified long-term care hospitals as defined in

[[Page 384]]

paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section, each hospital or unit under present 
or previous ownership that received payment under section 1886(b) of the 
Act during cost reporting periods beginning before October 1, 1990, may 
submit a request to its fiscal intermediary to rebase its target amount. 
The request must be received by the fiscal intermediary by the later of 
November 1, 1997 or 60 days before the beginning of its cost reporting 
period beginning during fiscal year 1998. The rebased target amount for 
the cost reporting period beginning during fiscal year 1998 is 
determined as follows:
    (A) Determine the hospital's inpatient operating costs per case for 
each of the five most recent settled cost reports as of August 5, 1997.
    (B) For each of the five cost reports, update the operating costs 
per case by the applicable update factors up to the hospital's cost 
reporting period beginning during FY 1998.
    (C) Exclude the highest and lowest of the five updated amounts 
determined under paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(B) of this section.
    (D) Compute the average for the remaining three updated amounts for 
operating cost per case.
    (v) Request by qualified long-term care hospital. A qualified long-
term care hospital may file a request to its fiscal intermediary for a 
rebased FY 1998 target amount. The request must be received by the 
fiscal intermediary by the later of November 1, 1997 or 60 days before 
the beginning of its cost reporting period beginning during fiscal year 
1998. The rebased FY 1998 target amount is the hospital's FY 1996 
inpatient operating costs updated to FY 1997. A qualified long-term care 
hospital means a long-term care hospital that meets the following two 
conditions for its two most recent settled cost reports as of August 5, 
1997:
    (A) Its Medicare inpatient operating costs exceed 115 percent of the 
ceiling.
    (B) The hospital would have had a disproportionate patient 
percentage (as defined in Sec. 412.106) equal to or greater than 70 
percent if it were a prospective payment hospital.
    (2) Periods subject to the ceiling. The ceiling established under 
this section applies to all cost reporting periods that--
    (i) Begin on or after October 1, 1982; and
    (ii) Immediately follow the base period established under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section unless the exception in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section is applicable.
    (3) Periods of other than 12 months. The ceiling established under 
this section does not apply to cost reporting periods of fewer than 12 
months that occur in conjunction with a change in operation of the 
facility, as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, as a 
result of changes in ownership, merger, or consolidation. However, the 
ceiling applies to cost reporting periods of fewer than 12 months that 
result solely from the approval of a hospital's request for a change in 
accounting cycle, as specified in Sec. 413.24(f)(3).
    (c) Costs subject to the ceiling. (1) Applicability. The ceiling 
established under this section applies to net operating costs incurred 
by a hospital in furnishing inpatient hospital services to Medicare 
beneficiaries.
    (2) Preadmission services. Net inpatient operating costs include 
certain preadmission services furnished by the hospital or by an entity 
wholly owned or operated by the hospital (that is, any entity for which 
the hospital itself is the sole owner or operator) to the patient on the 
calendar day immediately preceding the date of the patient's admission 
to the hospital. A hospital is considered the sole operator of an entity 
if the hospital has exclusive responsibility for conducting or 
overseeing the entity's routine operations, regardless of whether the 
hospital also has policymaking authority over the entity. The specific 
preadmission services (other than ambulance services) included in the 
net inpatient hospital operating costs are the following:
    (i) Diagnostic services (including clinical diagnostic laboratory 
tests) furnished on or after January 1, 1991.
    (ii) Other services related to the admission furnished on or after 
October 1, 1991. Other services related to the admission means services 
(other than diagnostic services) that are furnished in connection with 
the principal diagnosis

[[Page 385]]

that requires the beneficiary to be admitted as an inpatient.
    (3) Rate-of-increase percentages and update factors. The applicable 
rate-of-increase percentages and update factors are determined as 
follows:
    (i) Federal fiscal year 1986. The applicable rate-of-increase 
percentage for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 
1985 and before September 30, 1986 is five twenty-fourths of one 
percent, and the update factor is 1.00208333. For purposes of 
determining the target amount for cost reporting periods beginning on or 
after October 1, 1986, the applicable percentage increase for cost 
reporting periods beginning during Federal fiscal year 1986 is deemed to 
have been one-half percent, and the update factor is 1.005.
    (ii) Federal fiscal year 1987. The applicable rate-of-increase 
percentage for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 
1986 and before September 30, 1987 is 1.15 percent; the update factor is 
1.0115.
    (iii) Federal fiscal year 1988. The applicable rate-of-increase 
percentage for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 
1987 and before October 1, 1988 is 2.3238 percent; the update factor is 
1.023238. For purposes of updating the target amount for cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after October 1, 1988, the rate-of-increase 
percentage for cost reporting periods beginning during FY 1988 is deemed 
to have been 2.7 percent; the update factor is deemed to have been 
1.027.
    (iv) Federal fiscal year 1989 through Federal fiscal year 1993. The 
applicable rate-of-increase percentage for cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after October 1, 1988, and before October 1, 1993, is 
the percentage increase projected by the hospital market basket index 
(as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section).
    (v) Federal fiscal year 1994 through Federal fiscal year 1997. The 
applicable rate-of-increase percentage for cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after October 1, 1993, and before October 1, 1998, is 
the market basket percentage increase minus the lesser of, 1 percentage 
point, or the percentage point difference between 10 percent and the 
hospital's ``update adjustment percentage'' (as defined in paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section); for hospitals with an ``update adjustment 
percentage'' of at least 10 percent, the applicable rate-of-increase 
percentage is the market basket percentage increase. The ``update 
adjustment percentage'' is increased in each Federal fiscal year by the 
sum of the hospital's applicable reductions applied to the market basket 
percentage increase for previous Federal fiscal years.
    (vi) Federal fiscal year 1998. The applicable rate-of-increase 
percentage for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 
1997 is 0 percent.
    (vii) Federal fiscal year 1999 through Federal fiscal year 2002. The 
applicable rate-of-increase percentage for cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after October 1, 1998, and before October 1, 2002, based 
on data from the most recent available cost report, is:
    (A) The percentage increase in the market basket, if inpatient 
operating costs are equal to or exceed the ceiling amount by 10 percent 
or more of the ceiling.
    (B) The percentage increase in the market basket minus .25 
percentage points for each percentage point by which inpatient operating 
costs are less than 10 percent over the ceiling (but not less than 0), 
if inpatient operating costs exceed the ceiling by less than 10 percent 
of the ceiling.
    (C) The greater of the percentage increase in the market basket 
minus 2.5 percentage points or 0 percent, if inpatient operating costs 
are equal to or less than the ceiling but greater than 66.7 percent of 
the ceiling.
    (D) 0 percent, if inpatient operating costs do not exceed 66.7 
percent of the ceiling.
    (viii) Federal fiscal year 2003 and following. The applicable rate-
of-increase percentage for cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 2002, is the percentage increase projected by the hospital 
market basket index.
    (4) Target amount. The intermediary will establish a target amount 
for each hospital. The target amount for a cost reporting period is 
determined as follows:
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, and 
subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, for 
the first cost reporting

[[Page 386]]

period to which this ceiling applies, the target amount equals the 
hospital's allowable net inpatient operating costs per case for the 
hospital's base period increased by the update factor for the subject 
period.
    (ii) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this 
section, for subsequent cost reporting periods, the target amount equals 
the hospital's target amount for the previous cost reporting period 
increased by the update factor for the subject cost reporting period, 
unless the provisions of paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section apply.
    (iii) In the case of a psychiatric hospital or unit, rehabilitation 
hospital or unit, or long term care hospital, the target amount may not 
exceed--
    (A) For cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal year 1998, 
the 75th percentile of target amounts for hospitals in the same class 
(psychiatric hospital or unit, rehabilitation hospital or unit, or long 
term care hospital) for cost reporting periods ending during FY 1996, 
increased by the applicable market basket percentage up to the first 
cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1997.
    (B) For cost reporting periods beginning during FYs 1999 through 
2002, the amount determined under paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(A) increased by 
the market basket percentage increase up through the subject period, 
subject to paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section.
    (iv) In the case of a hospital that received payments under 
paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, for purposes of determining the 
hospital's target amount for the hospital's third 12-month cost 
reporting period, the target amount for the preceding cost reporting 
period is equal to the amount determined under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) 
of this section.
    (5) Applicable update factor. (i) The applicable update factor is 
derived from the prospectively determined rate-of-increase percentage 
published by HCFA. The update factor for each Federal fiscal year is 
applied prospectively to the target amount for each cost reporting 
period beginning during the Federal fiscal year.
    (ii) In the case of cost reporting periods of less than 12 months, 
the target amount determined for a hospital's first cost reporting 
period beginning in a Federal fiscal year applies to subsequent periods 
beginning in the same Federal fiscal year.
    (d) Application of the target amount in determining the amount of 
payment. (1) General process. (i) At the end of each cost reporting 
period subject to this section, the hospital's intermediary will compare 
a hospital's allowable net inpatient operating costs with that 
hospital's ceiling (as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section) for 
that period.
    (ii) The hospital's actual allowable costs will be determined 
without regard to the lesser of cost or charges provisions of 
Sec. 413.13, and in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (d)(2) 
or (d)(3) of this section, as applicable.
    (2) Net inpatient operating costs are less than or equal to the 
ceiling. For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 
1997, if a hospital's allowable net inpatient operating costs do not 
exceed the hospital's ceiling, payment to the hospital will be 
determined on the basis of the lower of the--
    (i) Net inpatient operating costs plus 15 percent of the difference 
between inpatient operating costs and the ceiling; or
    (ii) Net inpatient operating costs plus 2 percent of the ceiling.
    (3) Net inpatient operating costs are greater than the ceiling. For 
cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1997--
    (i) If a hospital's allowable net inpatient operating costs do not 
exceed 110 percent of the ceiling (or the adjusted ceiling, if 
applicable), payment will be the ceiling (or the adjusted ceiling, if 
applicable);
    (ii) If a hospital's allowable net inpatient operating costs are 
greater than 110 percent of the ceiling (or the adjusted ceiling, if 
applicable), payment will be the ceiling (or the adjusted ceiling, if 
applicable) plus the lesser of:
    (A) 50 percent of the allowable net inpatient operating costs in 
excess of 110 percent of the ceiling (or the adjusted ceiling, if 
applicable); or
    (B) 10 percent of the ceiling (or the adjusted ceiling, if 
applicable).
    (4) Continuous improvement bonus payments. For cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after October 1, 1997, eligible

[[Page 387]]

hospitals (as defined in paragraph (d)(5) of this section) receive 
payments in addition to those in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, as 
applicable. These payments are equal to the lesser of--
    (i) 50 percent of the amount by which the operating costs are less 
than the expected costs for the period; or
    (ii) 1 percent of the ceiling.
    (5) Eligibility requirements for continuous improvement bonus 
payments. To qualify, a hospital must have been paid as a prospective 
payment excluded hospital for at least three full cost reporting periods 
prior to the applicable period, and the hospital's operating costs per 
discharge for the period must be less than the least of the following:
    (i) The hospital's target amount.
    (ii) The hospital's trended costs.
    (A) For a hospital for which its cost reporting period ending during 
fiscal year 1996 was its third or subsequent full cost reporting period, 
trended costs are the lesser of the allowable inpatient operating costs 
per discharge or the target amount for the cost reporting period ending 
in fiscal year 1996, increased in a compounded manner for each 
succeeding fiscal year by the market basket percentage increase;
    (B) For all other hospitals, trended costs are the allowable 
inpatient operating costs per discharge for its third full cost 
reporting period increased in a compounded manner for each succeeding 
fiscal year by the market basket increase.
    (iii) The hospital's expected costs. The hospital's expected costs 
are the lesser of its allowable inpatient operating costs per discharge 
or the target amount for the previous cost reporting period, updated by 
the market basket percentage increase for the fiscal year.
    (e) Hospital requests regarding adjustments to the payment allowed 
under the rate-of-increase ceiling. (1) Timing of application. A 
hospital may request an adjustment to the rate-of-increase ceiling 
imposed under this section. The hospital's request must be received by 
the hospital's fiscal intermediary no later than 180 days after the date 
on the intermediary's initial notice of amount of program reimbursement 
(NPR) for the cost reporting period for which the hospital requests an 
adjustment.
    (2) Intermediary recommendation. Unless HCFA has authorized the 
intermediary to make the decision, the intermediary makes a 
recommendation on the hospital's request to HCFA, which makes the 
decision. HCFA issues a decision to the intermediary no later than 180 
days after receipt of the completed application and the intermediary's 
recommendation.
    (3) Intermediary decision. If HCFA has authorized the intermediary 
to make the decision, the intermediary issues a decision no later than 
180 days after receipt of the completed application.
    (4) Notification and review. (i) The intermediary notifies the 
hospital of the decision, including a full explanation of the grounds 
for the decision. A decision issued under paragraph (e)(2) or (e)(3) of 
this section is considered final unless the hospital submits additional 
information and requests a review of the decision no later than 180 days 
after the date on the intermediary's notice of the decision.
    (ii) The final decision is subject to review under the provider 
reimbursement determination and appeal procedures in subpart R of part 
405 of this chapter, provided the hospital has received an NPR for the 
cost reporting period in question, and the NPR disallows costs for which 
the hospital had requested an adjustment (see the definitions in 
Sec. 405.1801(a) of this chapter and the provisions regarding a 
provider's right to a Board hearing in Sec. 405.1835 of this chapter).
    (5) Extending time limit for PRRB review of NPR. The time required 
to review the request is considered good cause for the granting of an 
extension of the time limit to apply for review of the notice of amount 
of program reimbursement by the Provider Reimbursement Review Board, as 
specified in Sec. 405.1841(b) of this chapter.
    (6) Applicability. The provisions in paragraphs (e)(1) through 
(e)(5) of this section apply to a hospital's initial request for an 
adjustment and to a request for a review of the original decision based 
on additional data.
    (f) Comparison to the target amount for new hospitals and units--(1) 
New hospitals and units--(i) New hospitals. For purposes of this 
section, a new hospital

[[Page 388]]

is a provider of hospital inpatient services that--
    (A) Has operated as the type of hospital for which HCFA granted it 
approval to participate in the Medicare program, under present or 
previous ownership (or both), for less than 2 full years; and
    (B) Has provided the type of hospital inpatient services for which 
HCFA granted it approval to participate in the Medicare program, for 
less than 2 years.
    (ii) New units. A newly established unit that is excluded from the 
prospective payments system under the provisions of Secs. 412.25 through 
412.30 of this chapter does not qualify for the exemption afforded to a 
new hospital under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section unless the unit 
is located in an acute care hospital that, if it were subject to the 
provisions of this section, would qualify as a new hospital under 
paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section.
    (2) Comparison--(i) Exemptions. (A) A new children's hospital is 
exempt from the rate-of-increase ceiling imposed under this section. The 
exemption begins when the hospital accepts its first patient and ends at 
the end of the first cost reporting period ending at least 2 years after 
the hospital accepts its first patient. The first cost reporting period 
of at least 12 months beginning at least 1 year after the hospital 
accepts its first patient is the base year, in accordance with paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (B) Within 180 days of the date a hospital is excluded from the 
prospective payment system, the intermediary determines whether the 
hospital is exempt from the rate-of-increase ceiling. The intermediary 
notifies the hospital of its determination and the hospital's base 
period.
    (C) A decision issued under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section 
is considered final unless the hospital submits additional information 
and requests a review of the decision no later than 180 days after the 
date on the intermediary's notice of the decision. The final decision is 
subject to review under subpart R of part 405 of this chapter, provided 
the hospital has received a notice of program reimbursement (NPR) for 
the cost reporting period in question and the NPR does not reflect an 
exemption (see the definitions in Sec. 405.1801(a) of this chapter and 
the provisions regarding a provider's right to a Board hearing in 
Sec. 405.1835 of this chapter).
    (ii) Median target amount. (A) For cost reporting periods beginning 
on or after October 1, 1997, the amount of payment for a new psychiatric 
hospital or unit, a new rehabilitation hospital or unit, or a new long-
term care hospital that was not paid as an excluded hospital prior to 
October 1, 1997, is the lower of the hospital's net inpatient operating 
costs per case or 110 percent of the national median of the target 
amounts for the class of excluded hospitals and units (psychiatric, 
rehabilitation, long-term care) as adjusted and updated. This 
methodology applies to the hospital's first two 12-month cost reporting 
periods.
    (B) The national median of the target amounts is the FY 1996 median 
target amount--
    (1) Adjusted to account for differences in area wage levels;
    (2) Updated by the market basket percentage increase to the fiscal 
year in which the hospital first received payments as an excluded 
provider.
    (3) Risk-basis HMOs. Items or services that are furnished to 
beneficiaries enrolled in an HMO by a hospital that is either owned or 
operated by a risk-basis HMO or related to a risk-basis HMO by common 
ownership or control are exempt from the rate-of-increase ceiling (see 
the definition of an entity with a risk sharing contract in Sec. 417.401 
of this chapter).
    (g) Adjustments.--(1) General rule. HCFA may adjust the amount of 
the operating costs considered in establishing the rate-of-increase 
ceiling for one or more cost reporting periods, including both periods 
subject to the ceiling and the hospital's base period, under the 
circumstances specified below. When an adjustment is requested by the 
hospital, HCFA makes an adjustment only to the extent that the 
hospital's operating costs are reasonable, attributable to the 
circumstances specified separately identified by the hospital, and 
verified by the intermediary.

[[Page 389]]

 HCFA may grant an adjustment requested by the hospital only if a 
hospital's operating costs exceed the rate-of-increase ceiling imposed 
under this section. The amount of payment made to a hospital after an 
adjustment under paragraph (g) of this section is based on the 
difference between the hospital's operating costs and 110 percent of the 
ceiling.
    (2) Extraordinary circumstances. HCFA may make an adjustment to take 
into account unusual costs (in either a cost reporting period subject to 
the ceiling or the hospital's base period) due to extraordinary 
circumstances beyond the hospital's control. These circumstances 
include, but are not limited to, strikes, fire, earthquakes, floods, or 
similar unusual occurrences with substantial cost effects.
    (3) Comparability of cost reporting periods--(i) Adjustment for 
distortion. HCFA may make an adjustment to take into account factors 
that would result in a significant distortion in the operating costs of 
inpatient hospital services between the base year and the cost reporting 
period subject to the limits.
    (ii) Factors. The adjustments described in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of 
this section, include, but are not limited to, adjustments to take into 
account:
    (A) FICA taxes (if the hospital did not incur costs for FICA taxes 
in its base period).
    (B) Services billed under part B of Medicare during the base period, 
but paid under part A during the subject cost reporting period.
    (C) Malpractice insurance costs (if malpractice costs were not 
included in the base year operating costs).
    (D) Increases in service intensity or length of stay attributable to 
changes in the type of patient served.
    (E) A change in the inpatient hospital services that a hospital 
provides, and that are customarily provided directly by similar 
hospitals, such as an addition or discontinuation of services or 
treatment programs.
    (F) The manipulation of discharges to increase reimbursement.
    (iii) Adjusting operating costs. Without a formal request from a 
hospital, HCFA may adjust the amount of operating costs determined under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section to take into account certain 
adjustments. These adjustments include, but are not limited to, 
adjustments under paragraphs (g)(3)(ii)(A), (B), (C), (E), and (F) of 
this section.
    (4) Significant wage increase. (i) Criteria. HCFA may make an 
adjustment to take into account a significant increase in wages 
occurring between the base period and the cost reporting period subject 
to the ceiling if there is a significant increase in the average hourly 
wage for the geographic area in which the hospital is located 
(determined by reference to the wage index for prospective payment 
hospitals without regard to geographic reclassifications under sections 
1886(d)(8) and (10) of the Act). For this purpose, there is a 
significant wage increase if the wage index value based on wage survey 
data collected for the cost reporting period subject to the ceiling is 
at least 8.0 percent higher than the wage index value based on survey 
data collected for the base year cost reporting period. If survey data 
are not available for the cost reporting periods used in the comparison, 
the wage index value based on the latest available survey data collected 
prior to that cost reporting period is used.
    (ii) Amount of the adjustment. The adjustment for a significant wage 
increase equals the amount by which the lesser of the following 
calculations exceeds 108 percent of the increase in the national average 
hourly earnings for hospital workers:
    (A) The rate of increase in the average hourly wage in the 
geographic area (determined by applying the applicable increase in the 
area wage index value to the rate of increase in the national average 
hourly earnings for hospital workers).
    (B) The rate of increase in the hospital's average hourly wage.
    (5) Adjustment limitations. For cost reporting periods beginning on 
or after October 1, 1993, and before October 1, 2003, the payment 
reductions under paragraph (c)(3)(v) through (c)(3)(vii) of this section 
will not be considered when determining adjustments under this 
paragraph.
    (h)  [Reserved]

[[Page 390]]

    (i) Assignment of a new base period. (1) General rule. (i) Effective 
with cost reporting periods beginning on or after April 1, 1990, HCFA 
may assign a new base period to establish a revised ceiling if the new 
base period is more representative of the reasonable and necessary cost 
of furnishing inpatient services and all the following conditions apply:
    (A) The actual allowable inpatient costs of the hospital in the cost 
reporting period that would be affected by the revised ceiling exceed 
the target amount established under paragraph (c) of this section.
    (B) The hospital documents that the higher costs are the result of 
substantial and permanent changes in furnishing patient care services 
since the base period. In making this determination, HCFA takes into 
consideration the following factors:
    (1) Changes in the services provided by the hospital.
    (2) Changes in applicable technologies and medical practices.
    (3) Differences in the severity of illness among patients or types 
of patients served.
    (C) The adjustments described in paragraph (g) of this section would 
not result in recognition of the reasonable and necessary costs of 
providing inpatient services.
    (ii) The revised ceiling is based on the necessary and proper costs 
incurred during the new base period.
    (A) Increases in overhead costs (for example, administrative and 
general costs and housekeeping costs) are not taken into consideration 
unless the hospital documents that these increases result from 
substantial and permanent changes in furnishing patient care services.
    (B) In determining whether wage increases are necessary and proper, 
HCFA takes into consideration whether increases in wages and wage-
related costs for hospitals in the labor market area exceed the national 
average increase.
    (2) New base period. The new base period is the first cost reporting 
period that is 12 months or longer that reflects the substantial and 
permanent change.
    (3) New applicable rate-of-increase percentages and update factors. 
The revised target amount resulting from the assignment of a new base 
period is increased by the applicable rate-of-increase percentages 
(update factors) described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    (j) Reduction to capital-related costs. For psychiatric hospitals 
and units, rehabilitation hospitals and units, and long-term hospitals, 
the amount otherwise payable for capital-related costs is reduced by 15 
percent for portions of cost reporting periods occurring on or after 
October 1, 1997, through September 30, 2002.

<R04>
                        Subpart D--Apportionment


<R05>
Sec. 413.50  Apportionment of allowable costs.

    (a) Consistent with prevailing practice in which third-party 
organizations pay for health care on a cost basis, reimbursement under 
the Medicare program involves a determination of--
    (1) Each provider's allowable costs for producing services; and
    (2) The share of these costs which is to be borne by Medicare. The 
provider's costs are to be determined in accordance with the principles 
reviewed in the preceding discussion relating to allowable costs. The 
share to be borne by Medicare is to be determined in accordance with 
principles relating to apportionment of cost.
    (b) In the study and consideration devoted to the method of 
apportioning costs, the objective has been to adopt methods for use 
under Medicare that would, to the extent reasonably possible, result in 
the program's share of a provider's total allowable costs being the same 
as the program's share of the provider's total services. This result is 
essential for carrying out the statutory directive that the program's 
payments to providers should be such that the costs of covered services 
for beneficiaries would not be passed on to nonbeneficiaries, nor would 
the cost of

[[Page 391]]

services for nonbeneficiaries be borne by the program.
    (c) A basic factor bearing upon apportionment of costs is that 
Medicare beneficiaries are not a cross section of the total population. 
Nor will they constitute a cross section of all patients receiving 
services from most of the providers that participate in the program. 
Available evidence shows that the use of services by persons age 65 and 
over differs significantly from other groups. Consequently, the 
objective sought in the determination of the Medicare share of a 
provider's total costs means that the methods used for apportionment 
must take into account the differences in the amount of services 
received by patients who are beneficiaries and other patients serviced 
by the provider.
    (d) The method of cost reimbursement most widely used at the present 
time by third-party purchasers of inpatient hospital care apportions a 
provider's total costs among groups served on the basis of the relative 
number of days of care used. This method, commonly referred to as 
average-per-diem cost, does not take into account, variations in the 
amount of service which a day of care may represent and thereby assumes 
that the patients for whom payment is made on this basis are average in 
their use of service.
    (e) In considering the average-per-diem method of apportioning cost 
for use under the program, the difficulty encountered is that the 
preponderance of presently available evidence strongly indicates that 
the over-age 65 patient is not typical from the standpoint of average-
per-diem cost. On the average this patient stays in the hospital twice 
as long and therefore the ancillary services that he uses are averaged 
over the longer period of time, resulting in an average-per-diem cost 
for the aged alone, significantly below the average-per-diem for all 
patients.
    (f) Moreover, the relative use of services by aged patients as 
compared to other patients differs significantly among institutions. 
Consequently, considerations of equity among institutions are involved 
as well as that of effectiveness of the apportionment method under the 
program in accomplishing the objective of paying each provider fully, 
but only for services to beneficiaries.
    (g) A further consideration of long-range importance is that the 
relative use of services by aged and other patients can be expected to 
change, possibly to a significant extent in future years. The ability of 
apportionment methods used under the program to reflect such change is 
an element of flexibility which has been regarded as important in the 
formulation of the cost reimbursement principles.
    (h) An alternative to the relative number of days of care as a basis 
for apportioning costs is the relative amount of charges billed by the 
provider for services to patients. The amount of charges is the basis 
upon which the cost of hospital care is distributed among patients who 
pay directly for the services they receive. Payment for services on the 
basis of charges applies generally under insurance programs in which 
individuals are indemnified for incurred expenses, a form of health 
insurance widely held throughout the United States. Also, charges to 
patients are commonly a factor in determining the amount of payment to 
hospitals under insurance programs providing service benefits, many of 
which pay ``costs or charges, whichever is less'' and some of which pay 
exclusively on the basis of charges. In all of these instances, the 
provider's own charge structure and method of itemizing services for the 
purpose of assessing charges is utilized as a measure of the amount of 
services received and as the basis for allocating responsibility for 
payment among those receiving the provider's services.
    (i) An increasing number of third-party purchasers who pay for 
services on the basis of cost are developing methods that utilize 
charges to measure the amount of services for which they have 
responsibility for payment. In this approach, the amount of charges for 
such services as a proportion of the provider's total charges to all 
patients is used to determine the proportion of the provider's total 
costs for which the third-party purchaser assumes responsibility. The 
approach is subject to numerous variations. It can be applied to the 
total of charges for

[[Page 392]]

all services combined or it can be applied to components of the 
provider's activities for which the amount of costs and charges are 
ascertained through a breakdown of data from the provider's accounting 
records.
    (j) For the application of the approach to components, which 
represent types of services, the breakdown of total costs is 
accomplished by ``cost-finding'' techniques under which indirect costs 
and nonrevenue activities are allocated to revenue producing components 
for which charges are made as services are furnished.


<R05>
Sec. 413.53  Determination of cost of services to beneficiaries.

    (a) Principle. Total allowable costs of a provider will be 
apportioned between program beneficiaries and other patients so that the 
share borne by the program is based upon actual services received by 
program beneficiaries. The methods of apportionment are defined as 
follows:
    (1) Departmental method--(i) Methodology. Except as provided in 
paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section with respect to the treatment of 
the private room cost differential for cost reporting periods starting 
on or after October 1, 1982, the ratio of beneficiary charges to total 
patient charges for the services of each ancillary department is applied 
to the cost of the department; to this is added the cost of routine 
services for program beneficiaries, determined on the basis of a 
separate average cost per diem for general routine patient care areas as 
defined in paragraph (b) of this section, taking into account, in 
hospitals, a separate average cost per diem for each intensive care 
unit, coronary care unit, and other intensive care type inpatient 
hospital units.
    (ii) Exception: Indirect cost of private rooms. For cost reporting 
periods starting on or after October 1, 1982, except with respect to a 
hospital receiving payment under part 412 of this chapter (relating to 
the prospective payment system), the additional cost of furnishing 
services in private room accommodations is apportioned to Medicare only 
if these accommodations are furnished to program beneficiaries, and are 
medically necessary. To determine routine service cost applicable to 
beneficiaries--
    (A) Multiply the average cost per diem (as defined in paragraph (b) 
of this section) by the total number of Medicare patient days (including 
private room days whether or not medically necessary);
    (B) Add the product of the average per diem private room cost 
differential (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) and the 
number of medically necessary private room days used by beneficiaries; 
and
    (C) Effective October 1, 1990, do not include private rooms 
furnished for SNF-type and NF-type services under the swing-bed 
provision in the number of days in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) of 
this section.
    (2) Carve-out out method--(i) The carve-out out method is used to 
allocate hospital inpatient general routine service costs in a 
participating swing-bed hospital, as defined in Sec. 413.114(b). Under 
this method, effective for services furnished on or after October 1, 
1990, the reasonable costs attributable to the inpatient routine SNF-
type and NF-type services furnished to all classes of patients are 
subtracted from total inpatient routine service costs before computing 
the average cost per diem for inpatient routine hospital care.
    (ii) The cost per diem attributable to the routine SNF-type services 
covered by Medicare is based on the regional Medicare swing-bed SNF rate 
in effect for a given calendar year, as described in Sec. 413.114(c). 
The Medicare SNF rate applies only to days covered and paid as Medicare 
days. When Medicare coverage runs out, the Medicare rate no longer 
applies.
    (iii) The cost per diem attributable to all non-Medicare swing-bed 
days is based on the average statewide Medicaid NF rate for the prior 
calendar year, adjusted to approximate the average NF rate for the 
current calendar year.
    (iv) The sum of total Medicare SNF-type days multiplied by the cost 
per diem attributable to Medicare SNF-type services and the total NF-
type days multiplied by the cost per diem attributable to all non-
Medicare days is subtracted from total inpatient general routine service 
costs. The cost per diem for inpatient routine hospital

[[Page 393]]

care is computed based on the remaining inpatient routine service costs.
    (3) Cost per visit by type-of-service method--HHAs. For cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1980, all HHAs must 
use the cost per visit by type-of-service method of apportioning costs 
between Medicare and non-Medicare beneficiaries. Under this method, the 
total allowable cost of all visits for each type of service is divided 
by the total number of visits for that type of service. Next, for each 
type of service, the number of Medicare covered visits is multiplied by 
the average cost per visit just computed. This represents the cost 
Medicare will recognize as the cost for that service, subject to cost 
limits published by HCFA (see Sec. 413.30).
    (b) Definitions. As used in this section--
    Ancillary services means the services for which charges are 
customarily made in addition to routine services.
    Apportionment means an allocation or distribution of allowable cost 
between the beneficiaries of the Medicare program and other patients.
    Average cost per diem for general routine services means the 
following:
    (1) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 
1982, subject to the provisions on swing-bed hospitals, the average cost 
of general routine services net of the private room cost differential. 
The average cost per diem is computed by the following methodology:
    (i) Determine the total private room cost differential by 
multiplying the average per diem private room cost differential 
determined in paragraph (c) of this section by the total number of 
private room patient days.
    (ii) Determine the total inpatient general routine service costs net 
of the total private room cost differential by subtracting the total 
private room cost differential from total inpatient general routine 
service costs.
    (iii) Determine the average cost per diem by dividing the total 
inpatient general routine service cost net of private room cost 
differential by all inpatient general routine days, including total 
private room days.
    (2) For swing-bed hospitals, the amount computed by--(i) Subtracting 
the routine costs associated with Medicare SNF-type days and non-
Medicare NF-type days from the total allowable inpatient cost for 
routine services (excluding the cost of services provided in intensive 
care units, coronary care units, and other intensive care type inpatient 
hospital units and nursery costs); and
    (ii) Dividing the remainder (excluding the total private room cost 
differential) by the total number of inpatient hospital days of care 
(excluding Medicare SNF-type days and non-Medicare NF-type days of care, 
days of care in intensive care units, coronary care units, and other 
intensive care type inpatient hospital units; and newborn days; but 
including total private room days).
    Average cost per diem for hospital intensive care type units means 
the amount computed by dividing the total allowable costs for routine 
services in each of these units by the total number of inpatient days of 
care furnished in each of these units.
    Average per diem private room cost differential means the difference 
in the average per diem cost of furnishing routine services in a private 
room and in a semi-private room. (This differential is not applicable to 
hospital intensive care type units.) (The method for computing this 
differential is described in paragraph (c) of this section.)
    Charges means the regular rates for various services that are 
charged to both beneficiaries and other paying patients who receive the 
services. Implicit in the use of charges as the basis for apportionment 
is the objective that charges for services be related to the cost of the 
services.
    Intensive care type inpatient hospital unit means a hospital unit 
that furnishes services to critically ill inpatients. Examples of 
intensive care type units include, but are not limited to, intensive 
care units, trauma units, coronary care units, pulmonary care units, and 
burn units. Excluded as intensive care type units are postoperative 
recovery rooms, postanesthesia recovery rooms, maternity labor rooms, 
and subintensive or intermediate care units. (The unit must also meet 
the criteria of paragraph (d) of this section.)

[[Page 394]]

    Nursing facility (NF)-type services, formerly known as ICF and SNF-
type services, are routine services furnished by a swing-bed hospital to 
Medicaid and other non-Medicare patients. Under the Medicaid program, 
effective October 1, 1990, facilities are no longer certified as SNFs or 
ICFs but instead are certified only as NFs and can provide services as 
defined in section 1919(a)(1) of the Act.
    Skilled nursing facility (SNF)-type services are routine services 
furnished by a swing-bed hospital that would constitute extended care 
services if furnished by an SNF. SNF-type services include routine SNF 
services furnished in the distinct part SNF of a hospital complex that 
is combined with the hospital general routine service area cost center 
under Sec. 413.24(d)(5). Effective October 1, 1990, only Medicare 
covered services are included in the definition of SNF-type services.
    Ratio of beneficiary charges to total charges on a departmental 
basis means the ratio of charges to beneficiaries of the Medicare 
program for services of a revenue-producing department or center to the 
charges to all patients for that center during an accounting period. 
After each revenue-producing center's ratio is determined, the cost of 
services furnished to beneficiaries of the Medicare program is computed 
by applying the individual ratio for the center to the cost of the 
related center for the period.
    Routine services means the regular room, dietary, and nursing 
services, minor medical and surgical supplies, and the use of equipment 
and facilities for which a separate charge is not customarily made.
    (c) Method for computing the average per diem private room cost 
differential. Compute the average per diem private room cost 
differential as follows:
    (1) Determine the average per diem private room charge differential 
by subtracting the average per diem charge for all semi-private room 
accommodations from the average per diem charge for all private room 
accommodations. The average per diem charge for private room 
accommodations is determined by dividing the total charges for private 
room accommodations by the total number of days of care furnished in 
private room accommodations. The average per diem charge for semi-
private accommodations is determined by dividing the total charges for 
semi-private room accommodations by the total number of days of care 
furnished in semi-private accommodations.
    (2) Determine the inpatient general routine cost to charge ratio by 
dividing total inpatient general routine service cost by the total 
inpatient general routine service charges.
    (3) Determine the average per diem private room cost differential by 
multiplying the average per diem private room charge differential 
determined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section by the ratio determined 
in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (d) Criteria for identifying intensive care type units. For purposes 
of determining costs under this section, a unit will be identified as an 
intensive care type inpatient hospital unit only if the unit--
    (1) Is in a hospital;
    (2) Is physically and identifiably separate from general routine 
patient care areas, including subintensive or intermediate care units, 
and ancillary service areas. There cannot be a concurrent sharing of 
nursing staff between an intensive care type unit and units or areas 
furnishing different levels or types of care. However, two or more 
intensive care type units that concurrently share nursing staff can be 
reimbursed as one combined intensive care type unit if all other 
criteria are met. Float nurses (nurses who work in different units on an 
as-needed basis) can be utilized in the intensive care type unit. If a 
float nurse works in two different units during the same eight hour 
shift, then the costs must be allocated to the appropriate units 
depending upon the time spent in those units. The hospital must maintain 
adequate records to support the allocation. If such records are not 
available, then the costs must be allocated to the general routine 
services cost areas;
    (3) Has specific written policies that include criteria for 
admission to, and discharge from, the unit;
    (4) Has registered nursing care available on a continuous 24-hour 
basis with

[[Page 395]]

at least one registered nurse present in the unit at all times;
    (5) Maintains a minimum nurse-patient ratio of one nurse to two 
patients per patient day. Included in the calculation of this nurse-
patient ratio are registered nurses, licensed vocational nurses, 
licensed practical nurses, and nursing assistants who provide patient 
care. Not included are general support personnel such as ward clerks, 
custodians, and housekeeping personnel; and
    (6) Is equipped, or has available for immediate use, life-saving 
equipment necessary to treat the critically ill patients for which it is 
designed. This equipment may include, but is not limited to, respiratory 
and cardiac monitoring equipment, respirators, cardiac defibrillators, 
and wall or canister oxygen and compressed air.
    (e) Application--(1) Departmental method; Cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after October 1, 1982.
    (i) The following example illustrates how costs would be determined, 
using only inpatient data, for cost reporting periods beginning on or 
after October 1, 1982, based on apportionment of--
    (A) The average cost per diem for general routine services (subject 
to the private room differential provisions of paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of 
this section);
    (B) The average cost per diem for each intensive care type unit;
    (C) The ratio of beneficiary charges to total charges applied to 
cost by department.

                    Subpart E--Payments to Providers


<R05>
Sec. 413.60  Payments to providers: General.

    (a) The fiscal intermediaries will establish a basis for interim 
payments to each provider. This may be done by one of several methods. 
If an intermediary is already paying the provider on a cost basis, the 
intermediary may adjust its rate of payment to an estimate of the result 
under the Medicare principles of reimbursement. If no organization is 
paying the provider on a cost basis, the intermediary may obtain the 
previous year's financial statement from the provider and, by applying 
the principles of reimbursement, compute or approximate an appropriate 
rate of payment. The interim payment may be related to the last year's 
average per diem, or to charges, or to any other ready basis of 
approximating costs.
    (b) At the end of the period, the actual apportionment, based on the 
cost finding and apportionment methods selected by the provider, 
determines the Medicare reimbursement for the actual services provided 
to beneficiaries during the period.
    (c) Basically, therefore, interim payments to providers will be made 
for services throughout the year, with final settlement on a retroactive 
basis at the end of the accounting period. Interim payments will be made 
as often as possible and in no event less frequently than once a month. 
The retroactive payments will take fully into account the costs that 
were actually incurred and settle on an actual, rather than on an 
estimated basis.

[[Page 397]]


<R05>
Sec. 413.64  Payments to providers: Specific rules.

    (a) Reimbursement on a reasonable cost basis. Providers of services 
paid on the basis of the reasonable cost of services furnished to 
beneficiaries will receive interim payments approximating the actual 
costs of the provider. These payments will be made on the most 
expeditious schedule administratively feasible but not less often than 
monthly. A retroactive adjustment based on actual costs will be made at 
the end of a reporting period.
    (b) Amount and frequency of payment. Medicare states that providers 
of services will be paid the reasonable cost of services furnished to 
beneficiaries. Since actual costs of services cannot be determined until 
the end of the accounting period, the providers must be paid on an 
estimated cost basis during the year. While Medicare provides that 
interim payments will be made no less often than monthly, intermediaries 
are expected to make payments on the most expeditious basis 
administratively feasible. Whatever estimated cost basis is used for 
determining interim payments during the year, the intent is that the 
interim payments shall approximate actual costs as nearly as is 
practicable so that the retroactive adjustment based on actual costs 
will be as small as possible.
    (c) Interim payments during initial reporting period. At the 
beginning of the program or when a provider first participates in the 
program, it will be necessary to establish interim rates of payment to 
providers of services. Once a provider has filed a cost report under the 
Medicare program, the cost report may be used as a basis for determining 
the interim rate of reimbursement for the following period. However, 
since initially there is no previous history of cost under the program, 
the interim rate of payment must be determined by other methods, 
including the following:
    (1) If the intermediary is already paying the provider on a cost or 
cost-related basis, the intermediary will adjust its rate of payment to 
the program's principles of reimbursement. This rate may be either an 
amount per inpatient day, or a percent of the provider's charges for 
services furnished to the program's beneficiaries.
    (2) If an organization other than the intermediary is paying the 
provider for services on a cost or cost-related basis, the intermediary 
may obtain from that organization or from the provider itself the rate 
of payment being used and other cost information as may be needed to 
adjust that rate of payment to give recognition to the program's 
principles of reimbursement.
    (3) It no organization is paying the provider on a cost or cost-
related basis, the intermediary will obtain the previous year's 
financial statement from the provider. By analysis of such statement in 
light of the principles of reimbursement, the intermediary will compute 
an appropriate rate of payment.
    (4) After the initial interim rate has been set, the provider may at 
any time request, and be allowed, an appropriate increase in the 
computed rate, upon presentation of satisfactory evidence to the 
intermediary that costs have increased. Likewise, the intermediary may 
adjust the interim rate of payment if it has evidence that actual costs 
may fall significantly below the computed rate.
    (d) Interim payments for new providers. (1) Newly-established 
providers will not have cost experience on which to base a determination 
of an interim rate of payment. In such cases, the intermediary will use 
the following methods to determine an appropriate rate:
    (i) If there is a provider or providers comparable in substantially 
all relevant factors to the provider for which the rate is needed, the 
intermediary will base an interim rate of payment on the costs of the 
comparable provider.
    (ii) If there are no substantially comparable providers from whom 
data are available, the intermediary will determine an interim rate of 
payment based on the budgeted or projected costs of the provider.
    (2) Under either method, the intermediary will review the provider's 
cost experience after a period of three months. If need for an 
adjustment is indicated, the interim rate of payment will be adjusted in 
line with the provider's cost experience.

[[Page 398]]

    (e) Interim payments after initial reporting period. Interim rates 
of payment for services provided after the initial reporting period will 
be established on the basis of the cost report filed for the previous 
year covering Medicare services. The current rate will be determined--
whether on a per diem or percentage of charges basis--using the previous 
year's costs of covered services and making any appropriate adjustments 
required to bring, as closely as possible, the current year's rate of 
interim payment into agreement with current year's costs. This interim 
rate of payment may be adjusted by the intermediary during an accounting 
period if the provider submits appropriate evidence that its actual 
costs are or will be significantly higher than the computed rate. 
Likewise, the intermediary may adjust the interim rate of payment if it 
has evidence that actual costs may fall significantly below the computed 
rate.
    (f) Retroactive adjustment. (1) Medicare provides that providers of 
services will be paid amounts determined to be due, but not less often 
than monthly, with necessary adjustments due to previously made 
overpayments or underpayments. Interim payments are made on the basis of 
estimated costs. Actual costs reimbursable to a provider cannot be 
determined until the cost reports are filed and costs are verified. 
Therefore, a retroactive adjustment will be made at the end of the 
reporting period to bring the interim payments made to the provider 
during the period into agreement with the reimbursable amount payable to 
the provider for the services furnished to program beneficiaries during 
that period.
    (2) In order to reimburse the provider as quickly as possible, an 
initial retroactive adjustment will be made as soon as the cost report 
is received. For this purpose, the costs will be accepted as reported, 
unless there are obvious errors or inconsistencies, subject to later 
audit. When an audit is made and the final liability of the program is 
determined, a final adjustment will be made.
    (3) To determine the retroactive adjustment, the amount of the 
provider's total allowable cost apportioned to the program for the 
reporting year is computed. This is the total amount of reimbursement 
the provider is due to receive from the program and the beneficiaries 
for covered services furnished during the reporting period. The total of 
the interim payments made by the program in the reporting year and the 
deductibles and coinsurance amounts receivable from beneficiaries is 
computed. The difference between the reimbursement due and the payments 
made is the amount of the retroactive adjustment.
    (g) Accelerated payments to providers. Upon request, an accelerated 
payment may be made to a provider of services that is not receiving 
periodic interim payments under paragraph (h) of this section if the 
provider has experienced financial difficulties due to a delay by the 
intermediary in making payments or in exceptional situations, in which 
the provider has experienced a temporary delay in preparing and 
submitting bills to the intermediary beyond its normal billing cycle. 
Any such payment must be approved first by the intermediary and then by 
HCFA. The amount of the payment is computed as a percentage of the net 
reimbursement for unbilled or unpaid covered services. Recovery of the 
accelerated payment may be made by recoupment as provider bills are 
processed or by direct payment.
    (h) Periodic interim payment method of reimbursement--(1) Covered 
services furnished before July 1, 1987. In addition to the regular 
methods of interim payment on individual provider billings for covered 
services, the periodic interim payment (PIP) method is available for 
Part A hospital and SNF inpatient services and for both Part A and Part 
B HHA services.
    (2) Covered services furnished on or after July 1, 1987. Effective 
with claims received on or after July 1, 1987, the periodic interim 
payment (PIP) method is available for the following:
    (i) Part A inpatient hospital services furnished in hospitals that 
are excluded from the prospective payment systems under subpart B of 
part 412 of this chapter.
    (ii) Part A services furnished in hospitals receiving payment in 
accordance with a demonstration project authorized under section 402(a) 
of Public Law

[[Page 399]]

90-248 (42 U.S.C. 1395b-1) or section 222(a) of Public Law 92-603 (42 
U.S.C. 1395b-1 (note)), or a State reimbursement control system approved 
under section 1886(c) of the Act and subpart C of part 403 of this 
chapter, if that type of payment is specifically approved by HCFA as an 
integral part of the demonstration or control system. If that type of 
payment is not an integral part of the demonstration or control system, 
PIP is available for the hospital under paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this 
section for hospitals excluded from the prospective payment systems or 
under Sec. 412.116(b) of this chapter for prospective payment hospitals.
    (iii) Part A SNF services.
    (iv) Part A and Part B HHA services.
    (v) Part A services furnished in hospitals paid under the 
prospective payment system, including distinct part psychiatric or 
rehabilitation units, as described in Sec. 412.116(b) of this chapter.
    (vi) Services furnished in a hospice as specified in part 418 of 
this chapter. Payment on a PIP basis is described in Sec. 418.307 of 
this chapter.
    (3) Any participating provider furnishing the services described in 
paragraph (h)(1) of this section that establishes to the satisfaction of 
the intermediary that it meets the following requirements may elect to 
be reimbursed under the PIP method, beginning with the first month after 
its request that the intermediary finds administratively feasible:
    (i) The provider's estimated total Medicare reimbursement for 
inpatient services is at least $25,000 a year computed under the PIP 
formula or, in the case of an HHA, either its estimated--
    (A) Total Medicare reimbursement for Part A and Part B services is 
at least $25,000 a year computed under the PIP formula; or
    (B) Medicare reimbursement computed under the PIP formula is at 
least 50 percent of estimated total allowable cost.
    (ii) The provider has filed at least one completed Medicare cost 
report accepted by the intermediary as providing an accurate basis for 
computation of program payment (except in the case of a provider 
requesting reimbursement under the PIP method upon first entering the 
Medicare program).
    (iii) The provider has the continuing capability of maintaining in 
its records the cost, charge, and statistical data needed to accurately 
complete a Medicare cost report on a timely basis.
    (iv) The provider has repaid or agrees to repay any outstanding 
current financing payment in full, such payment to be made before the 
effective date of its requested conversion from a regular interim 
payment method to the PIP method.
    (4) No conversion to the PIP method may be made with respect to any 
provider until after that provider has repaid in full its outstanding 
current financing payment.
    (5) The intermediary's approval of a provider's request for 
reimbursement under the PIP method will be conditioned upon the 
intermediary's best judgment as to whether payment can be made to the 
provider under the PIP method without undue risk of its resulting in an 
overpayment because of greatly varying or substantially declining 
Medicare utilization, inadequate billing practices, or other 
circumstances. The intermediary may terminate PIP reimbursement to a 
provider at any time it determines that the provider no longer meets the 
qualifying requirements or that the provider's experience under the PIP 
method shows that proper payment cannot be made under this method.
    (6) Payment will be made biweekly under the PIP method unless the 
provider requests a longer fixed interval (not to exceed one month) 
between payments. The payment amount will be computed by the 
intermediary to approximate, on the average, the cost of covered 
inpatient or home health services furnished by the provider during the 
period for which the payment is to be made, and each payment will be 
made two weeks after the end of such period of services. Upon request, 
the intermediary will, if feasible, compute the provider's payments to 
recognize significant seasonal variation in Medicare utilization of 
services on a quarterly basis starting with the beginning of the 
provider's reporting year.
    (7) A provider's PIP amount may be appropriately adjusted at any 
time if the provider presents or the

[[Page 400]]

intermediary otherwise obtains evidence relating to the provider's costs 
or Medicare utilization that warrants such adjustment. In addition, the 
intermediary will recompute the payment immediately upon completion of 
the desk review of a provider's cost report and also at regular 
intervals not less often than quarterly. The intermediary may make a 
retroactive lump sum interim payment to a provider, based upon an 
increase in its PIP amount, in order to bring past interim payments for 
the provider's current cost reporting period into line with the adjusted 
payment amount. The objective of intermediary monitoring of provider 
costs and utilization is to assure payments approximating, as closely as 
possible, the reimbursement to be determined at settlement for the cost 
reporting period. A significant factor in evaluating the amount of the 
payment in terms of the realization of the projected Medicare 
utilization of services is the timely submittal to the intermediary of 
completed admission and billing forms. All providers must complete 
billings in detail under this method as under regular interim payment 
procedures.
    (i) Bankruptcy or insolvency of provider. If on the basis of 
reliable evidence, the intermediary has a valid basis for believing 
that, with respect to a provider, proceedings have been or will shortly 
be instituted in a State or Federal court for purposes of determining 
whether such provider is insolvent or bankrupt under an appropriate 
State or Federal law, any payments to the provider will be adjusted by 
the intermediary, notwithstanding any other regulation or program 
instruction regarding the timing or manner of such adjustments, to a 
level necessary to insure that no overpayment to the provider is made.
    (j) Interest payments resulting from judicial review--(1) 
Application. If a provider of services seeks judicial review by a 
Federal court (see Sec. 405.1877 of this chapter) of a decision 
furnished by the Provider Reimbursement Review Board or subsequent 
reversal, affirmation, or modification by the Secretary, the amount of 
any award of such Federal court will be increased by interest payable by 
the party against whom the judgment is made (see Sec. 413.153 for 
treatment of interest). The interest is payable for the period beginning 
on the first day of the first month following the 180-day period which 
began on either the date the intermediary made a final determination or 
the date the intermediary would have made a final determination had it 
been done on a timely basis (see Secs. 405.1835(b) and 405.1841(a) of 
this chapter).
    (2) Amount due. Section 1878(f) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 1395oo(f), 
authorizes a court to award interest in favor of the prevailing party on 
any amount due as a result of the court's decision. If the intermediary 
withheld any portion of the amount in controversy prior to the date the 
provider seeks judicial review by a Federal court, and the Medicare 
program is the prevailing party, interest is payable by the provider 
only on the amount not withheld. Similarly, if the Medicare program 
seeks to recover amounts previously paid to a provider, and the provider 
is the prevailing party, interest on the amounts previously paid to a 
provider is not payable by the Medicare program since that amount had 
been paid and is not due the provider.
    (3) Rate. The amount of interest to be paid is equal to the rate of 
return on equity capital (see Sec. 413.157) in effect for the month in 
which the civil action is commenced.

    Example: An intermediary made a final determinaton on the amount of 
Medicare program reimbursement on June 15, 1974, and the provider 
appealed that determination to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board. 
The Board heard the appeal and rendered a decision adverse to the 
provider. On October 28, 1974, the provider commenced civil action to 
have such decision reviewed. The rate of return on equity capital for 
the month of October 1974 was 11.625 percent. The period for which 
interest is computed begins on January 1, 1975, and the interest 
beginning January 1, 1975, would be at the rate of 11.625 percent per 
annum.

Sec. 413.70  Payment for services of a CAH.

    Payment for inpatient and outpatient services of a CAH is the 
reasonable costs of the CAH in providing such services, as determined in 
accordance with section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act and the applicable 
principles of cost reimbursement in this part and in part 415 of this 
chapter.

Sec. 413.74  Payment to a foreign hospital.

    (a) Principle. Section 1814(f) of the Act provides for the payment 
of emergency and nonemergency inpatient hospital services furnished by 
foreign hospitals to Medicare beneficiaries. Subpart H of part 424 of 
this chapter, together with this section, specify the conditions for 
payment. These conditions may result in payments only to Canadian and 
Mexican hospitals.
    (b) Amount of payment. Effective with admissions on or after January 
1, 1980, the reasonable cost for services covered under the Medicare 
program furnished to beneficiaries by a foreign hospital will be equal 
to 100 percent of the hospital's customary charges (as defined in 
Sec. 413.13(b)) for the services.
    (c) Submittal of claims. The hospital must establish its customary 
charges for the services by submitting an itemized bill with each claim 
it files in accordance with its election under Sec. 424.104 of this 
chapter.
    (d) Exchange rate. Payment to the hospital will be subject to the 
official exchange rate on the date the patient is discharged and to the 
applicable deductible and coinsurance amounts described in Secs. 409.80 
through 409.83.

<R04>
                 Subpart F--Specific Categories of Costs


<R05>
Sec. 413.80  Bad debts, charity, and courtesy allowances.

    (a) Principle. Bad debts, charity, and courtesy allowances are 
deductions from revenue and are not to be included in allowable cost; 
however, except for anesthetists' services described under paragraph (h) 
of this section, bad debts attributable to the deductibles and 
coinsurance amounts are reimbursable under the program.
    (b) Definitions--(1) Bad debts. Bad debts are amounts considered to 
be uncollectible from accounts and notes receivable that were created or 
acquired in providing services. ``Accounts receivable'' and ``notes 
receivable'' are designations for claims arising from the furnishing of 
services, and are collectible in money in the relatively near future.
    (2) Charity allowances. Charity allowances are reductions in charges 
made by the provider of services because of the indigence or medical 
indigence of the patient. Cost of free care (uncompensated services) 
furnished under a Hill-Burton obligation are considered as charity 
allowances.
    (3) Courtesy allowances. Courtesy allowances indicate a reduction in 
charges in the form of an allowance to physicians, clergy, members of 
religious orders, and others as approved by the governing body of the 
provider, for services received from the provider. Employee fringe 
benefits, such as hospitalization and personnel health programs, are not 
considered to be courtesy allowances.
    (c) Normal accounting treatment: Reduction in revenue. Bad debts, 
charity, and courtesy allowances represent reductions in revenue. The 
failure to collect charges for services furnished does not add to the 
cost of providing the services. Such costs have already been incurred in 
the production of the services.
    (d) Requirements for Medicare. Under Medicare, costs of covered 
services furnished beneficiaries are not to be borne by individuals not 
covered by the Medicare program, and conversely, costs of services 
provided for other than beneficiaries are not to be borne by the 
Medicare program. Uncollected revenue related to services furnished to 
beneficiaries of the program generally means the provider has not 
recovered the cost of services covered by that revenue. The failure of 
beneficiaries to pay the deductible and coinsurance amounts could result 
in the related costs of covered services being borne by other than 
Medicare beneficiaries. To assure that such covered service costs

[[Page 402]]

are not borne by others, the costs attributable to the deductible and 
coinsurance amounts that remain unpaid are added to the Medicare share 
of allowable costs. Bad debts arising from other sources are not 
allowable costs.
    (e) Criteria for allowable bad debt. A bad debt must meet the 
following criteria to be allowable:
    (1) The debt must be related to covered services and derived from 
deductible and coinsurance amounts.
    (2) The provider must be able to establish that reasonable 
collection efforts were made.
    (3) The debt was actually uncollectible when claimed as worthless.
    (4) Sound business judgment established that there was no likelihood 
of recovery at any time in the future.
    (f) Charging of bad debts and bad debt recoveries. The amounts 
uncollectible from specific beneficiaries are to be charged off as bad 
debts in the accounting period in which the accounts are deemed to be 
worthless. In some cases an amount previously written off as a bad debt 
and allocated to the program may be recovered in a subsequent accounting 
period; in such cases the income therefrom must be used to reduce the 
cost of beneficiary services for the period in which the collection is 
made.
    (g) Charity allowances. Charity allowances have no relationship to 
beneficiaries of the Medicare program and are not allowable costs. These 
charity allowances include the costs of uncompensated services furnished 
under a Hill-Burton obligation. (Note: In accordance with section 106(b) 
of Pub. L. 97-248 (enacted September 3, 1982), this sentence is 
effective with respect to any costs incurred under Medicare except that 
it does not apply to costs which have been allowed prior to September 3, 
1982, pursuant to a final court order affirmed by a United States Court 
of Appeals.) The cost to the provider of employee fringe-benefit 
programs is an allowable element of reimbursement.
    (h) Exception. Bad debts arising from services for anesthetists paid 
under a fee schedule are not reimbursable under the program.

60 FR 63189, Dec. 8, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 413.85  Cost of educational activities.

    (a) Payment--(1) General rule. Except as provided in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, a provider's allowable cost may include its net 
cost of approved educational activities, as calculated under paragraph 
(g) of this section. The net cost is subject to apportionment based on 
Medicare utilization as described in Sec. 413.50.
    (2) Exception. For cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 
1, 1985, payment to hospitals and hospital-based providers for approved 
residency programs in medicine, osteopathy, dentistry, and podiatry is 
determined as provided in Sec. 413.86.
    (b) Definition--Approved educational activities. Approved 
educational activities means formally organized or planned programs of 
study usually engaged in by providers in order to enhance the quality of 
patient care in an institution. These activities must be licensed if 
required by State law. If licensing is not required, the institution 
must receive approval from the recognized national professional 
organization for the particular activity.
    (c) Educational activities. Many providers engage in educational 
activities including training programs for nurses, medical students, 
interns and residents, and various paramedical specialties. These 
programs contribute to the quality of patient care within an institution 
and are necessary to meet the community's needs for medical and 
paramedical personnel. It is recognized that the costs of such 
educational activities should be borne by the community. However, many 
communities have not assumed responsibility for financing these programs 
and it is necessary that support be provided by those purchasing health 
care. Until communities undertake to bear these costs, the program will 
participate appropriately in the support of these activities. Although 
the intent of the program is to share in the support of educational 
activities customarily or

[[Page 403]]

traditionally carried on by providers in conjunction with their 
operations, it is not intended that this program should participate in 
increased costs resulting from redistribution of costs from educational 
institutions or units to patient care institutions or units.
    (d) Activities not within the scope of this principle. The costs of 
the following activities are not within the scope of this principle but 
are recognized as normal operating costs and are reimbursed in 
accordance with applicable principles--
    (1) Orientation and on-the-job training;
    (2) Part-time education for bona fide employees at properly 
accredited academic or technical institutions (including other 
providers) devoted to undergraduate or graduate work;
    (3) Costs, including associated travel expense, or sending employees 
to educational seminars and workshops that increase the quality of 
medical care or operating efficiency of the provider;
    (4) Maintenance of a medical library;
    (5) Training of a patient or patient's family in the use of medical 
appliances;
    (6) Clinical training of students not enrolled in an approved 
education program operated by the provider; and
    (7) Other activities that do not involve the actual operation of an 
approved education program including the costs of interns and residents 
in anesthesiology who are employed to replace anesthetists.
    (e) Approved programs. Recognized professional and paramedical 
educational training programs now being conducted by provider 
institutions, and their approving bodies, include the following:

                                         College of Radiology.          
                                                                        

    (f) Other educational programs. There may also be other educational 
programs not included in the foregoing in which a provider institution 
is engaged. Appropriate consideration will be given by the intermediary 
and

HCFA to the costs incurred for those activities that come within the 
purview of the principle when determining the allowable costs for 
apportionment under the Medicare program.
    (g) Calculating net cost. Net costs of approved educational 
activities are determined by deducting, from a provider's total costs of 
these activities, revenues it receives from tuition. For this purpose, a 
provider's total costs include trainee stipends, compensation of 
teachers, and other direct and indirect costs of the activities as 
determined under the Medicare cost-finding principles in Sec. 413.24.

Sec. 413.86  Direct graduate medical education payments.

    (a) Statutory basis and scope--(1) Basis. This section implements 
section 1886(h) of the Act by establishing the methodology for Medicare 
payment of the cost of direct graduate medical educational activities.
    (2) Scope. This section applies to Medicare payments to hospitals 
and hospital-based providers for the costs of approved residency 
programs in medicine, osteopathy, dentistry, and podiatry for cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1985.
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following 
definitions apply:
     Affiliated group means two or more hospitals located in the same 
geographic wage area (as that term is used under part 412 of this 
subchapter for the prospective payment system) in which individual 
residents work at each of the hospitals seeking to be treated as an 
affiliated group during the course of the approved program; or, if the 
hospitals are not located in the same geographic wage area, the 
hospitals are jointly listed as major participating institutions for one 
or more programs as that term is used in Graduate Medical Education 
Directory, 1997-1998.
    Approved geriatric program means a fellowship program of one or more 
years in length that is approved by the Accreditation Council for 
Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) under the ACGME's criteria for 
geriatric fellowship programs.
    Approved medical residency program means a program that meets one of 
the following criteria:
    (1) Is approved by one of the national organizations listed in 
Sec. 415.200(a) of this chapter.
    (2) May count towards certification of the participant in a 
specialty or subspecialty listed in the current edition of either of the 
following publications:
    (i) The Directory of Graduate Medical Education Programs published 
by the American Medical Association, and available from American Medical 
Association, Department of Directories and Publications, 515 North State

60201.
    (3) Is approved by the Accreditation Council For Graduate Medical 
Education (ACGME) as a fellowship program in geriatric medicine.
    (4) Is a program that would be accredited except for the accrediting 
agency's reliance upon an accreditation standard that requires an entity 
to perform an induced abortion or require, provide, or refer for 
training in the performance of induced abortions, or make arrangements 
for such training, regardless of whether the standard provides 
exceptions or exemptions.
    Base period means a cost reporting period that began on or after 
October 1, 1983 but before October 1, 1984.
    CPI--U stands for the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers 
as compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
    Foreign medical graduate means a resident who is not a graduate of a 
medical, osteopathy, dental, or podiatry school, respectively, 
accredited or approved as meeting the standards necessary for 
accreditation by one of the following organizations:
    (1) The Liaison Committee on Medical Education of the American 
Medical Association.
    (2) The American Osteopathic Association.

[[Page 405]]

    FMGEMS stands for the Foreign Medical Graduate Examination in the 
Medical Sciences (Part I and Part II).
    FTE stands for full-time equivalent.
    Medicare patient load means, with respect to a hospital's cost 
reporting period, the total number of hospital inpatient days during the 
cost reporting period that are attributable to patients for whom payment 
is made under Medicare Part A divided by total hospital inpatient days. 
In calculating inpatient days, inpatient days in any distinct part of 
the hospital furnishing a hospital level of care are included and 
nursery days are excluded.
    Primary care resident is a resident enrolled in an approved medical 
residency training program in family medicine, general internal 
medicine, general pediatrics, preventive medicine, geriatric medicine or 
osteopathic general practice.
    Resident means an intern, resident, or fellow who participates in an 
approved medical residency program, including programs in osteopathy, 
dentistry, and podiatry, as required in order to become certified by the 
appropriate specialty board.
    (c) Payment for graduate medical education costs--General rule. 
Beginning with cost reporting periods starting on or after July 1, 1985, 
hospitals, including hospital-based providers, are paid for the costs of 
approved graduate medical education programs as described in paragraph 
(d) through (h) of this section.
    (d) Calculating payment for graduate medical education costs. A 
hospital's Medicare payment for the costs of an approved residency 
program is calculated as follows:
    (1) Step one. The hospital's updated per resident amount (as 
determined under paragraph (e) of this section) is multipled by the 
actual number of FTE residents (as determined under paragraph (g) of 
this section). This result is the aggregate approved amount for the cost 
reporting period.
    (2) Step two. The product derived in step one is multipled by the 
hospital's Medicare patient load.
    (3) Step three. For portions of cost reporting periods beginning on 
or after January 1, 1998, the product derived in step one is multiplied 
by the proportion of the hospital's inpatient days attributable to 
individuals who are enrolled under a risk-sharing contract with an 
eligible organization under section 1876 of the Act and who are entitled 
to Medicare Part A or with a Medicare+Choice organization under Title 
XVIII, Part C of the Act. This amount is multiplied by an applicable 
payment percentage equal to--
    (i) 20 percent for 1998;
    (ii) 40 percent for 1999;
    (iii) 60 percent in 2000;
    (iv) 80 percent in 2001; and
    (v) 100 percent in 2002 and subsequent years.
    (4) Step four. Add the results of steps 2 and 3.
    (5) Step five. The product derived in step two is apportioned 
between Part A and Part B of Medicare based on the ratio of Medicare's 
share of reasonable costs excluding graduate medical education costs 
attributable to each part as determined through the Medicare cost 
report.
    (e) Determining per resident amounts for the base period--(1) For 
the base period. (i) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this 
section, the intermediary determines a base-period per resident amount 
for each hospital as follows:
    (A) Determine the allowable graduate medical education costs for the 
cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1983 but before 
October 1, 1984. In determining these costs, graduate medical education 
costs allocated to the nursery cost center, research and other 
nonreimbursable cost centers, and hospital-based providers that are not 
participating in Medicare are excluded and graduate medical education 
costs allocated to distinct-part hospital units and hospital-based 
providers that participate in Medicare are included.
    (B) Divide the costs calculated in paragraph (e)(1)(i)(A) of this 
section by the average number of FTE residents working in all areas of 
the hospital complex (including those areas whose costs were excluded 
under paragraph (e)(1)(i)(A) of this section) for its cost

[[Page 406]]

reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1983 but before 
October 1, 1984.
    (ii) In determining the base-period per resident amount under 
paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, the intermediary--
    (A) Verifies the hospital's base-period graduate medical education 
costs and the hospital's average number of FTE residents;
    (B) Excludes from the base-period graduate medical education costs 
any nonallowable or misclassified costs, including those previously 
allowed under Sec. 412.113(b)(3) of this chapter; and
    (C) Upon a hospital's request, includes graduate medical education 
costs that were misclassified as operating costs during the hospital's 
prospective payment base year and were not allowable under 
Sec. 412.113(b)(3) of this chapter during the graduate medical education 
base period. These costs may be included only if the hospital requests 
an adjustment of its prospective payment hospital-specific rate or 
target amount as described in paragraph (j)(2) of this section.
    (iii) If the hospital's cost report for its GME base period is no 
longer subject to reopening under Sec. 405.1885 of this chapter, the 
intermediary may modify the hospital's base-period costs solely for 
purposes of computing the per resident amount.
    (iv) If the intermediary modifies a hospital's base-period graduate 
medical education costs as described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this 
section, the hospital may request an adjustment of its prospective 
payment hospital-specific rate or target amount as described in 
paragraph (j)(1) of this section.
    (v) The intermediary notifies each hospital that either had direct 
graduate medical education costs or received indirect education payment 
in its cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1984 and 
before October 1, 1985 of its base-period average per resident amount. A 
hospital may appeal this amount within 180 days of the date of that 
notice.
    (2) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1985 
and before July 1, 1986. For cost reporting periods beginning on or 
after July 1, 1985 and before July 1, 1986, a hospital's base-period per 
resident amount is adjusted as follows:
    (i) If a hospital's base period began on or after October 1, 1983 
and before July 1, 1984, the amount is adjusted by the percentage change 
in the CPI-U that occurred between the hospital's base period and the 
first cost reporting period to which the provisions of this section 
apply. The adjusted amount is then increased by one percent.
    (ii) If a hospital's base period began on or after July 1, 1984 and 
before October 1, 1984, the amount is increased by one percent.
    (3) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1986. 
For cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1986, a 
hospital's base-period per resident amount is adjusted as follows:
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, each 
hospital's per resident amount for the previous cost reporting is 
adjusted by the projected change in the CPI-U for the 12-month cost 
reporting period. This adjustment is subject to revision during the 
settlement of the cost report to reflect actual changes in the CPI-U 
that occurred during the cost reporting period.
    (ii) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 
1993 through September 30, 1995, each hospital's per resident amount for 
the previous cost reporting period will not be adjusted for any resident 
FTEs who are not either a primary care resident or an obstetrics and 
gynecology resident.
    (4) Exceptions--(i) Base period for certain hospitals. If a hospital 
did not have any approved medical residency training programs or did not 
participate in Medicare during the base period, but either condition 
changes in a cost reporting period beginning on or after July 1, 1985, 
the intermediary establishes a per resident amount for the hospital 
using the information from the first cost reporting period during which 
the hospital participates in Medicare and the residents are on duty 
during the first month of that period. Any graduate medical education 
program costs incurred by the hospital before that cost reporting period 
are reimbursed on a reasonable cost basis. The per resident amount is 
based on the lower of the following:

[[Page 407]]

    (A) The hospital's actual costs, incurred in connection with the 
graduate medical education program for the hospital's first cost 
reporting period in which residents were on duty during the first month 
of the cost reporting period.
    (B) The mean value of per resident amounts of hospitals located in 
the same geographic wage area, as that term is used in the prospective 
payment system under part 412 of this chapter, for cost reporting 
periods beginning in the same fiscal years. If there are fewer than 
three amounts that can be used to calculate the mean value, the 
calculation of the per resident amounts includes all hospitals in the 
hospital's region as that term is used in Sec. 412.62(f)(1)(i).
    (ii) Short or long base-period cost reporting periods. If a 
hospital's base-period cost reporting period reflects graduate medical 
education costs for a period that is shorter than 50 weeks or longer 
than 54 weeks, the intermediary converts the allowable costs for the 
base period into a daily figure. The daily figure is then multiplied by 
365 or 366, as appropriate, to derive the approved per resident amount 
for a 12-month base-period cost reporting period. If a hospital has two 
cost reporting periods beginning in the base period, the later period 
serves as the base-period cost reporting period.
    (iii) Short or long cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
July 1, 1985. If a hospital's cost reporting period is shorter than 50 
weeks or longer than 54 weeks, the hospital's intermediary should 
contact HCFA Central Office to receive a special CPI-U adjustment 
factor.
    (f) Determining the total number of FTE residents. (1) Subject to 
the weighting factors in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section, the 
count of FTE residents is determined as follows:
    (i) Residents in an approved program working in all areas of the 
hospital complex may be counted.
    (ii) No individual may be counted as more than one FTE. If a 
resident spends time in more than one hospital or, except as provided in 
paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, in a nonprovider setting, the 
resident counts as a partial FTE based on the proportion of time worked 
at the hospital to the total time worked. A part-time resident counts as 
a partial FTE based on the proportion of allowable time worked compared 
to the total time necessary to fill a full-time internship or residency 
slot.
    (iii) On or after July 1, 1987, the time residents spend in 
nonprovider settings such as freestanding clinics, nursing homes, and 
physicians' offices in connection with approved programs is not excluded 
in determining the number of FTE residents in the calculation of a 
hospital's resident count if the following conditions are met:
    (A) The resident spends his or her time in patient care activities.
    (B) There is a written agreement between the hospital and the 
outside entity that states that the resident's compensation for training 
time spent outside of the hospital setting is to be paid by the 
hospital.
    (2) To include a resident in the FTE count for a particular cost 
reporting period, the hospital must furnish the following information.

The information must be certified by an official of the hospital and, if 
different, an official responsible for administering the residency 
program.
    (i) The name and social security number of the resident.
    (ii) The type of residency program in which the individual 
participates and the number of years the resident has completed in all 
types of residency programs.
    (iii) The dates the resident is assigned to the hospital and any 
hospital-based providers.
    (iv) The dates the resident is assigned to other hospitals, or other 
freestanding providers, and any nonprovider setting during the cost 
reporting period, if any.
    (v) The name of the medical, osteopathic, dental, or podiatric 
school from which the resident graduated and the date of graduation.
    (vi) If the resident is an FMG, documentation concerning whether the 
resident has satisfied the requirements of paragraph (h) of this 
section.
    (vii) The name of the employer paying the resident's salary.
    (g) Determining the weighted number of FTE residents. Subject to the 
provisions

[[Page 408]]

in paragraph (h) of this section, HCFA determines a hospital's number of 
FTE residents by applying a weighting factor to each resident and then 
summing the resulting numbers that represent each resident. The 
weighting factor is determined as follows:
    (1) For purposes of this section, an initial residency period is the 
number of years necessary to satisfy the minimum requirements for 
certification in a specialty or subspecialty, plus one year. Effective 
August 10, 1993, residents or fellows in an approved preventive medicine 
residency or fellowship program may also be counted as a full FTE 
resident for up to two additional years beyond the initial residency 
period limitations. Effective July 1, 1995, an initial residency period 
is defined as the minimum number of years required for board 
eligibility. An initial residency period may not exceed five years in 
order to be counted toward determining FTE status except in the case of 
fellows in an approved geriatric program whose initial residency period 
may last up to two additional years. For combined residency programs, an 
initial residency period is defined as the time required for individual 
certification in the longer of the programs. If the resident is enrolled 
in a combined medical residency training program in which all of the 
individual programs (that are combined) are for training primary care 
residents (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) or obstetrics 
and gynecology residents, the initial residency period is the time 
required for individual certification in the longer of the programs plus 
one year.
    (i) For residency programs other than those specified in paragraphs 
(g)(1)(ii) and (g)(1)(iii) of this section, the initial residency period 
is the minimum number of years of formal training necessary to satisfy 
the requirements for initial board eligibility in the particular 
specialty for which the resident is training, as specified in the 1985-
1986 Directory of Residency Training Programs.
    (ii) For residency programs in osteopathy, dentistry, and podiatry, 
the minimum requirement for certification in a specialty or subspecialty 
is the minimum number of years of formal training necessary to satisfy 
the requirements of the appropriate approving body listed in 
Sec. 415.200(a) of this chapter.
    (iii) For residency programs in geriatric medicine approved by the 
ACGME, as set forth in later editions of the directory specified in 
paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, these programs are considered 
approved programs retroactively to the latter of--
    (A) The starting date of the program within a hospital; or
    (B) The hospital's costs reporting period beginning on or after July 
1, 1985.
    (iv) The time spent in residency programs that do not lead to 
certification in a specialty or subspecialty, but that otherwise meet 
the definition of approved programs, as described in paragraph (b) of 
this section, is counted toward the initial residency period limitation.
    (2) If the resident is in an initial residency period, the weighting 
factor is one.
    (3) If the resident is not in an initial residency period, the 
weighting factor is 1.00 during the period beginning on or after July 1, 
1985 and before July 1, 1986, .75 during the period beginning on or 
after July 1, 1986 and before July 1, 1987 and is .50 thereafter without 
regard to the hospital's cost reporting period.
    (4) For purposes of determining direct graduate medical education 
payment, for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 
1997, a hospital's unweighted FTE count for residents in allopathic and 
osteopathic medicine may not exceed the hospital's unweighted FTE count 
for these residents for the most recent cost reporting period ending on 
or before December 31, 1996. If the hospital's number of FTE residents 
in a cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1997, 
exceeds the limit described in this paragraph (g), the hospital's 
weighted FTE count (before application of the limit) will be reduced in 
the same proportion that the number of FTE residents for that cost 
reporting period exceeds the number of FTE residents for the most recent 
cost reporting period ending on or before December 31, 1996. Hospitals 
that are part of the same affiliated group may elect to apply the

[[Page 409]]

limit on an aggregate basis. The fiscal intermediary may make 
appropriate modifications to apply the provisions of this paragraph 
(g)(4) based on the equivalent of a 12-month cost reporting period.
    (5) For purposes of determining direct graduate medical education 
payment, for the hospital's first cost reporting period beginning on or 
after October 1, 1997, the hospital's weighted FTE count is equal to the 
average of the weighted FTE count for the payment year cost reporting 
period and the preceding cost reporting period. For cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after October 1, 1998, the hospital's weighted 
FTE count is equal to the average of the weighted FTE count for the 
payment year cost reporting period and the preceding two cost reporting 
periods. The fiscal intermediary may make appropriate modifications to 
apply the provisions of this paragraph based on the equivalent of 12-
month cost reporting periods.
    (6) If a hospital established a new medical residency training 
program as defined in this paragraph (g) after January 1, 1995, the 
hospital's FTE cap described under paragraph (g)(4) of this section may 
be adjusted as follows:
    (i) If a hospital had no residents before January 1, 1995, and it 
establishes a new medical residency training program on or after that 
date, the hospital's unweighted FTE resident cap under paragraph (g)(4) 
of this section may be adjusted based on the product of the number of 
first year residents in the program in the third year of the program's 
existence and the number of years in which residents are expected to 
complete that program based on the minimum accredited length for the 
type of program. For these hospitals, the cap will only be adjusted 
based on the first program (or programs, if established simultaneously) 
beginning on or after January 1, 1995. The cap will not be revised for 
programs subsequently established.
    (ii) If a hospital had residents in its most recent cost reporting 
period ending before January 1, 1995, the hospital's unweighted FTE cap 
may be adjusted for new medical residency training programs established 
on or after January 1, 1995 and August 5, 1997. Increases in the 
hospital's FTE resident limit are permitted for the new program based on 
the product of the number of first-year residents in the third year of 
the newly established program and the number of years in which residents 
are expected to complete each program based on the minimum accredited 
length for the type of program. The hospital's unweighted FTE limit for 
a cost reporting period may be adjusted to reflect the number of 
residents in its most recent cost reporting period ending on or before 
December 31, 1996 and up to the incremental increase in its FTE count 
only for the newly established programs.
    (iii) If a hospital with residents in its most recent cost reporting 
period ending on or before January 1, 1995, is located in a rural area 
(or other hospitals located in rural areas which added residents under 
paragraph (g)(6)(i) of this section), the hospital's unweighted FTE 
limit may be adjusted in the same manner described in paragraph 
(g)(6)(ii) of this section to reflect the increase for residents in the 
new medical residency training programs established after August 5, 
1997. For these hospitals, the limit will be adjusted for additional new 
programs but not for expansions of existing or previously existing 
programs.
    (iv) A hospital seeking an adjustment to the limit on its unweighted 
resident count policy must provide documentation to its fiscal 
intermediary justifying the adjustment.
    (7) For purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, new medical 
residency training program means a medical residency training program 
that receives initial accreditation by the appropriate accrediting body 
on or after July 1, 1995.
    (h) Determination of weighting factors for foreign medical 
graduates. (1) The weighting factor for a foreign medical graduate is 
determined under the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section if the 
foreign medical graduate--
    (i) Has passed FMGEMS; or
    (ii) Before July 1, 1986, received certification from, or passed an 
examination of, the Educational Committee for Foreign Medical Graduates.
    (2) Before July 1, 1986, the weighting factor for a foreign medical 
graduate is

[[Page 410]]

1.0 times the weight determined under the provisions of paragraph (g) of 
this section. On or after July 1, 1986, and before July 1, 1987, the 
weighting factor for a graduate of a foreign medical school who was in a 
residency program both before and after July 1, 1986 but who does not 
meet the requirements set forth in paragraph (h)(1) of this section is 
.50 times the weight determined under the provisions of paragraph (g) of 
this section.
    (3) On or after July 1, 1987, these foreign medical graduates are 
not counted in determining the number of FTE residents.
    (4) During the cost reporting period in which a foreign medical 
graduate passes FMGEMS, the weighting factor for that resident is 
determined under the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section for the 
part of the cost reporting period beginning with the month the resident 
passes the test.
    (5) On or after September 1, 1989, the National Board of Medical 
Examiners Examination, Parts I and II, may be substituted for FMGEMS for 
purposes of the determination made under paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(4) of 
this section.
    (6) On or after June 1, 1992, the United States Medical Licensing 
Examination may be substituted for the FMGEMS for purposes of the 
determination made under paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(4) of this section. 
On or after July 1, 1993 only the results of steps I and II of the 
United States Medical Licensing Examination shall be accepted for 
purposes of making this determination.
    (i) Special rules for States that formerly had a waiver from 
Medicare reimbursement principles. (1) Effective for cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 1986, hospitals in States that, 
prior to becoming subject to the prospective payment system, had a 
waiver for the operation of a State reimbursement control system under 
section 1886(c) of the Act, section 402 of the Social Security 
Amendments of 1967 (42 U.S.C. 1395b-1 or section 222(a) of the Social 
Security Amendment of 1972 (42 U.S.C. 1395b-1 (note)) are permitted to 
change the order in which they allocate administrative and general costs 
to the order specified in the instructions for the Medicare cost report.
    (2) For hospitals making this election, the base-period costs for 
the purpose of determining the per resident amount are adjusted to take 
into account the change in the order by which they allocate 
administrative and general costs to interns and residents in approved 
program cost centers.
    (3) Per resident amounts are determined for the base period and 
updated as described in paragraph (e) of this section. For cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 1986, payment is made 
based on the methodology described in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (j) Adjustment of a hospital's target amount or prospective payment 
hospital-specific rate--(1) Misclassified operating costs--(i) General 
rule. If a hospital has its base-period graduate medical education costs 
reduced under paragraph (e)(1) of this section because those costs 
included misclassified operating costs, the hospital may request that 
the intermediary review the classification of the affected costs in its 
rate-of-increase ceiling or prospective payment base year for purposes 
of adjusting the hospital's target amount or hospital-specific rate. For 
those cost reports that are not subject to reopening under Sec. 405.1885 
of this chapter, the hospital's reopening request must explicitly state 
that the review is limited to this one issue.
    (ii) Request for review. The hospital must request review of the 
classification of its rate of increase ceiling or prospective payment 
base year costs no later than 180 days after the date of the notice by 
the intermediary of the hospital's base-period average per resident 
amount. A hospital's request for review must include sufficient 
documentation to demonstrate to the intermediary that adjustment of the 
hospital's hospital-specific rate or target amount is warranted.
    (iii) Effect of intermediary's review. If the intermediary, upon 
review of the hospital's costs, determines that the hospital's hospital-
specific rate or target amount should be adjusted, the adjustment of the 
hospital-specific rate or the target amount is effective for the 
hospital's cost reporting periods

[[Page 411]]

subject to the prospective payment system or the rate-of-increase 
ceiling that are still subject to reopening under Sec. 405.1885 of this 
chapter.
    (2) Misclassification of graduate medical education costs--(i) 
General rule. If costs that should have been classified as graduate 
medical education costs were treated as operating costs during both the 
graduate medical education base period and the rate-of-increase ceiling 
base year or prospective payment base year and the hospital wishes to 
receive benefit for the appropriate classification of these costs as 
graduate medical education costs in the graduate medical education base 
period, the hospital must request that the intermediary review the 
classification of the affected costs in the rate-of-increase ceiling or 
prospective payment base year for purposes of adjusting the hospital's 
target amount or hospital-specific rate. For those cost reports that are 
not subject to reopening under Sec. 405.1885 of this chapter, the 
hospital's reopening request must explicitly state that the review is 
limited to this one issue.
    (ii) Request for review. The hospital must request review of the 
classification of its costs no later than 180 days after the date of the 
intermediary's notice of the hospital's base-period average per resident 
amount. A hospital's request for review must include sufficient 
documentation to demonstrate to the intermediary that modification of 
the adjustment of the hospital's hospital-specific rate or target amount 
is warranted.
    (iii) Effect of intermediary's review. If the intermediary, upon 
review of the hospital's costs, determines that the hospital's hospital-
specific rate or target amount should be adjusted, the adjustment of the 
hospital-specific rate and the adjustment of the target amount is 
effective for the hospital's cost reporting periods subject to the 
prospective payment system or the rate-of-increase ceiling that are 
still subject to reopening under Sec. 405.1885 of this chapter.

Sec. 413.90  Research costs.

    (a) Principle. Costs incurred for research purposes, over and above 
usual patient care, are not includable as allowable costs.
    (b) Application. (1) There are numerous sources of financing for 
health-related research activities. Funds for this purpose are provided 
under many Federal programs and by other tax-supported agencies. Also, 
many foundations, voluntary health agencies, and other private 
organizations, as well as individuals, sponsor or contribute to the 
support of medical and related research. Funds available from such 
sources are generally ample to meet basic medical and hospital research 
needs. A further consideration is that quality review should be assured 
as a condition of governmental support for research. Provisions for such 
review would introduce special difficulties in the Medicare programs.
    (2) If research is conducted in conjunction with, and as a part of, 
the care of patients, the costs of usual patient care and studies, 
analyses, surveys, and related activities to serve the provider's 
administrative and program needs are allowable costs in the 
determination of payment under Medicare.

<R05>
Sec. 413.94  Value of services of nonpaid workers.

    (a) Principle. The value of services in positions customarily held 
by full-time employees performed on a regular, scheduled basis by 
individuals as nonpaid members of organizations under arrangements 
between such organizations and a provider for the performance of such 
services without direct remuneration from the provider to such 
individuals is allowable as an operating expense for the determination 
of allowable cost subject to the limitation contained in paragraph (b) 
of this section. The amounts allowed are not to exceed those paid others 
for similar work. Such amounts must be identifiable in the records of 
the institutions as a legal obligation for operating expenses.

[[Page 412]]

    (b) Limitations: Services of nonpaid workers. The services must be 
performed on a regular, scheduled basis in positions customarily held by 
full-time employees and necessary to enable the provider to carry out 
the functions of normal patient care and operation of the institution. 
The value of services of a type for which providers generally do not 
remunerate individuals performing such services is not allowable as a 
reimbursable cost under the Medicare program. For example, donated 
services of individuals in distributing books and magazines to patients, 
or in serving in a provider canteen or cafeteria or in a provider gift 
shop, would not be reimbursable.
    (c) Application. The following illustrates how a provider would 
determine an amount to be allowed under this principle: The prevailing 
salary for a lay nurse working in Hospital A is $5,000 for the year. The 
lay nurse receives no maintenance or special perquisites. A sister 
working as a nurse engaged in the same activities in the same hospital 
receives maintenance and special perquisites which cost the hospital 
$2,000 and are included in the hospital's allowable operating costs. The 
hospital would then include in its records an additional $3,000 to bring 
the value of the services rendered to $5,000. The amount of $3,000 would 
be allowable if the provider assumes obligation for the expense under a 
written agreement with the sisterhood or other religious order covering 
payment by the provider for the services.


<R05>
Sec. 413.98  Purchase discounts and allowances, and refunds of expenses.

    (a) Principle. Discounts and allowances received on purchases of 
goods or services are reductions of the costs to which they relate. 
Similarly, refunds of previous expense payments are reductions of the 
related expense.
    (b) Definitions--(1) Discounts. Discounts, in general, are 
reductions granted for the settlement of debts.
    (2) Allowances. Allowances are deductions granted for damage, delay, 
shortage, imperfection, or other causes, excluding discounts and 
returns.
    (3) Refunds. Refunds are amounts paid back or a credit allowed on 
account of an overcollection.
    (c) Normal accounting treatment--Reduction of costs. All discounts, 
allowances, and refunds of expenses are reductions in the cost of goods 
or services purchased and are not income. If they are received in the 
same accounting period in which the purchases were made or expenses were 
incurred, they will reduce the purchases or expenses of that period. 
However, if they are received in a later accounting period, they will 
reduce the comparable purchases or expenses in the period in which they 
are received.
    (d) Application. (1) Purchase discounts have been classified as 
cash, trade, or quantity discounts. Cash discounts are reductions 
granted for the settlement of debts before they are due. Trade discounts 
are reductions from list prices granted to a class of customers before 
consideration of credit terms. Quantity discounts are reductions from 
list prices granted because of the size of individual or aggregate 
purchase transactions. Whatever the classification of purchase 
discounts, like treatment in reducing allowable costs is required. In 
the past, purchase discounts were considered as financial management 
income. However, modern accounting theory holds that income is not 
derived from a purchase but rather from a sale or an exchange and that 
purchase discounts are reductions in the cost of whatever was purchased. 
The true cost of the goods or services is the net amount actually paid 
for them. Treating purchase discounts as income would result in an 
overstatement of costs to the extent of the discount.
    (2) As with discounts, allowances, and rebates received from 
purchases of goods or services, refunds of previous expense payments are 
clearly reductions in costs and must be reflected in the determination 
of allowable costs. This treatment is equitable and is in accord with 
that generally followed by other governmental programs and third-party 
payment organizations paying on the basis of cost.


<R05>
Sec. 413.100  Special treatment of certain accrued costs.

    (a) Principle. As described in Sec. 413.24(b)(2), under the accrual 
basis of accounting, revenue is reported in the

[[Page 413]]

period in which it is earned and expenses are reported in the period in 
which they are incurred. In the case of accrued costs described in this 
section, for Medicare payment purposes the costs are allowable in the 
year in which the costs are accrued and claimed for Medicare payment 
only under the conditions set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) Definitions. (1) All-inclusive paid days off benefit. An all-
inclusive paid days off benefit replaces other vacation and sick pay 
plans. It is a formal plan under which, based on actual hours worked, 
all employees accrue vested leave or payment in lieu of vested leave for 
any combination of types of leave, such as illness, medical 
appointments, holidays, and vacations.
    (2) Self-insurance. Self-insurance is a means by which a provider 
independently or as part of a group undertakes the risk of protecting 
itself against anticipated liabilities by providing funds in an amount 
equal to anticipated liabilities, rather than by purchasing insurance 
coverage.
    (c) Recognition of accrued costs. (1) General. Although Medicare 
recognizes, in the year of accrual, the accrual of costs for which a 
provider has not actually expended funds during the current cost 
reporting period, for purposes of payment Medicare does not recognize 
the accrual of costs unless the related liabilities are liquidated 
timely.
    (2) Requirements for liquidation of liabilities. For accrued costs 
to be recognized for Medicare payment in the year of the accrual, the 
requirements set forth below must be met with respect to the liquidation 
of related liabilities. If liquidation does not meet these requirements, 
the cost is disallowed, generally in the year of accrual, except as 
specified in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (i) A short-term liability.
    (A) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section, a 
short-term liability, including the current portion of a long-term 
liability (for example, mortgage interest payments due to be paid in the 
current year), must be liquidated within 1 year after the end of the 
cost reporting period in which the liability is incurred.
    (B) If, within the 1-year time limit, the provider furnishes to the 
intermediary sufficient written justification (based upon documented 
evidence) for nonpayment of the liability , the intermediary may grant 
an extension for good cause. The extension may not exceed 3 years beyond 
the end of the cost reporting year in which the liability was incurred.
    (ii) Vacation pay and all-inclusive paid days off.
    (A) If the provider's vacation policy, or its policy for all-
inclusive paid days off, is consistent for all employees, liquidation of 
the liability must be made within the period provided for by that 
policy.
    (B) If the provider's vacation policy, or its policy for all-
inclusive paid days off, is not consistent for all employees, 
liquidation of the liability must be made within 2 years after the close 
of the cost reporting period in which the liability is accrued.
    (C) If payment is not made within the required time period or if 
benefits are forfeited by the employee, an adjustment to disallow the 
accrued cost is made in the current period (that is, the latest year in 
which payment should have been made or the year in which the benefits 
are forfeited) rather than in the period in which the cost was accrued 
and claimed for Medicare payment. However, an intermediary may choose to 
require the adjustment in the period in which the cost was accrued and 
claimed for Medicare payment if the cost report for that period is open 
or can be reopened as provided in Sec. 405.1885 of this chapter, and if 
the intermediary believes the adjustment is more appropriate in that 
period.
    (iii) Sick pay.
    (A) If sick leave is vested and funded in a deferred compensation 
plan, liabilities related to the contributions to the fund must be 
liquidated, generally within 1 year after the end of the cost reporting 
period in which the liability is incurred. If, within the 1-year time 
limit, the provider furnishes to the intermediary sufficient written 
justification (based upon documented evidence) for nonpayment of the 
liability, the intermediary may grant an extension for good cause. The 
extension may not exceed 3 years beyond the end of

[[Page 414]]

the cost reporting year in which the liability was incurred. 
Contributions to the deferred compensation plan must be reduced to 
reflect estimated forfeitures. Actual forfeitures above or below 
estimated forfeitures must be used to adjust annual contributions to the 
fund.
    (B) If the sick leave plan grants employees the nonforfeitable right 
to demand cash payment for unused sick leave at the end of each year, 
sick pay is includable in allowable costs, without funding, in the cost 
reporting period in which it is earned.
    (C) Sick pay paid on any basis other than that specified in 
paragraphs (c)(2)(iii) (A) or (B) of this section can be claimed for 
Medicare payment only on a cash basis for the year in which the benefits 
are paid.
    (iv) Compensation of owners. Accrued liability related to 
compensation of owners other than sole proprietors and partners must be 
liquidated within 75 days after the close of the cost reporting period 
in which the liability occurs.
    (v) Nonpaid workers. Obligations incurred under a legally-
enforceable agreement to remunerate an organization of nonpaid workers 
must be discharged no later than the end of the provider's cost 
reporting period following the period in which the services were 
furnished.
    (vi) FICA and other payroll taxes. The provider's share of FICA and 
other payroll taxes that the provider becomes obligated to remit to 
governmental agencies is included in allowable costs only during the 
cost reporting period in which payment (upon which the tax is based) is 
actually made to the employee. For example, no legal obligation exists 
for a provider-employer to pay FICA taxes until the employee is paid and 
the specific amount of liability known.
    (vii) Deferred compensation.
    (A) Reasonable provider payments made under unfunded deferred 
compensation plans are included in allowable costs only during the cost 
reporting period in which actual payment is made to the participating 
employee.
    (B) Accrued liability related to contributions to a funded deferred 
compensation plan must be liquidated within 1 year after the end of the 
cost reporting period in which the liability is incurred. An extension, 
not to exceed 3 years beyond the end of the cost reporting year in which 
the liability was incurred, may be granted by the intermediary for good 
cause if the provider, within the 1-year time limit, furnishes to the 
intermediary sufficient written justification for non-payment of the 
liability.
    (C) Postretirement benefit plans (including those addressed in 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 (December 1990)) are 
deferred compensation arrangements and thus are subject to the 
provisions of this section regarding deferred compensation and to 
applicable program instructions for determining Medicare payment for 
deferred compensation.
    (viii) Self-insurance. Accrued liability related to contributions to 
a self-insurance program that are systematically made to a funding 
agency and that cover malpractice and comprehensive general liability, 
unemployment compensation, workers' compensation insurance losses, or 
employee health benefits, must be liquidated within 75 days after the 
close of the cost reporting period.

[60 FR 33136, June 27, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 413.102  Compensation of owners.

    (a) Principle. A reasonable allowance of compensation for services 
of owners is an allowable cost provided that the services are actually 
performed in a necessary function.
    (b) Definitions. (1) Compensation. Compensation means the total 
benefit received by the owner for the services he furnishes to the 
institution. It includes the following items:
    (i) Salary amounts paid for managerial, administrative, 
professional, and other services.
    (ii) Amounts paid by the institution for the personal benefit of the 
proprietor.
    (iii) The cost of assets and services that the proprietor receives 
from the institution.
    (iv) Deferred compensation.
    (2) Reasonableness. Reasonableness requires that the compensation 
allowance--

[[Page 415]]

    (i) Be such an amount as would ordinarily be paid for comparable 
services by comparable institutions; and
    (ii) Depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.
    (3) Necessary. Necessary requires that the function be--
    (i) Such that had the owner not furnished the services, the 
institution would have had to employ another person to perform the 
services; and
    (ii) Pertinent to the operation and sound conduct of the 
institution.
    (c) Application. (1) Owners of provider organizations often furnish 
services as managers, administrators, or in other capacities. In such 
cases, it is equitable that reasonable compensation for the services 
furnished to be an allowable cost. To do otherwise would disadvantage 
such owners in comparison with corporate providers or providers 
employing persons to perform similar services.
    (2) Ordinarily, compensation paid to proprietors is a distribution 
of profits. However, if a proprietor furnishes necessary services for 
the institution, the institution is in effect employing his services, 
and a reasonable compensation for these services is an allowable cost. 
In corporate providers, the salaries of owners who are also employees 
are subject to the same requirements of reasonableness. If the services 
are furnished on less than a full-time basis, the allowable compensation 
should reflect an amount proportionate to a full-time basis. 
Reasonableness of compensation may be determined by reference to, or in 
comparison with, compensation paid for comparable services and 
responsibilities in comparable institutions; or it may be determined by 
other appropriate means.


<R05>
Sec. 413.106  Reasonable cost of physical and other therapy services furnished under arrangements.

    (a) Principle. The reasonable cost of the services of physical, 
occupational, speech, and other therapists, and services of other health 
specialists (other than physicians), furnished under arrangements (as 
defined in section 1861(w) of the Act) with a provider of services, a 
clinic, a rehabilitation agency or a public health agency, may not 
exceed an amount equivalent to the prevailing salary and additional 
costs that would reasonably have been incurred by the provider or other 
organization had such services been performed by such person in an 
employment relationship, plus the cost of other reasonable expenses 
incurred by such person in furnishing services under such an 
arrangement. However, if the services of a therapist are required on a 
limited part-time basis, or to perform intermittent services, payment 
may be made on the basis of a reasonable rate per unit of service, even 
though this rate may be greater per unit of time than salary-related 
amounts, if the greater payment is, in the aggregate, less than the 
amount that would have been paid had a therapist been employed on a 
full-time or regular part-time salaried basis. Pursuant to section 17(a) 
of Public Law 93-233 (87 Stat. 967), the provisions of this section are 
effective for cost reporting periods beginning after March, 1975.
    (b) Definitions--(1) Prevailing salary. The prevailing salary is the 
hourly salary rate based on the 75th percentile of salary ranges paid by 
providers in the geographical area, by type of therapy, to therapists 
working full time in an employment relationship.
    (2) Fringe benefit and expense factor. The standard fringe benefit 
and expense factor is an amount that takes account of fringe benefits, 
such as vacation pay, insurance premiums, pension payments, allowances 
for job-related training, meals, etc., generally received by an employee 
therapist, as well as expenses, such as maintaining an office, 
appropriate insurance, etc., an individual not working as an employee 
might incur in furnishing services under arrangements.
    (3) Adjusted hourly salary equivalency amount. The adjusted hourly 
salary equivalency amount is the prevailing hourly salary rate plus the 
standard fringe benefit and expense factor. This amount is determined on 
a periodic basis for appropriate geographical areas.
    (4) Travel allowance. A standard travel allowance is an amount that 
is recognized, in addition to the adjusted hourly salary equivalency 
amount.

[[Page 416]]

    (5) Limited part-time or intermittent services. Therapy services are 
considered to be on a limited part-time or intermittent basis if the 
provider or other organization furnishing the services under 
arrangements requires the services of a therapist or therapists on an 
average of less than 15 hours per week. This determination is made by 
dividing the total hours of services furnished during the cost reporting 
period by the number of weeks in which the services were furnished in 
the cost reporting period regardless of the number of days in each week 
in which services were performed.
    (6) Guidelines. Guidelines are the amounts published by HCFA 
reflecting the application of paragraphs (b) (1) through (4) of this 
section to an individual therapy service and a geographical area. Other 
statistically valid data may be used to establish guidelines for a 
geographical area, provided that the study designs, questionnaires and 
instructions, as well as the resultant survey data for determining the 
guidelines are submitted to and approved in advance by HCFA. Such data 
must be arrayed so as to permit the determination of the 75th percentile 
of the range of salaries paid to full-time employee therapists.
    (7) Administrative responsibility. Administrative responsibility is 
the performance of those duties that normally fall within the purview of 
a department head or other supervisor. This term does not apply to 
directing aides or other assistants in furnishing direct patient care.
    (c) Application. (1) Under this provision, HCFA will establish 
criteria for use in determining the reasonable cost of physical, 
occupational, speech, and other therapy services and the services of 
other health specialists (other than physicians) furnished by 
individuals under arrangements with a provider of services, a clinic, a 
rehabilitation agency, or public health agency. It is recognized that 
providers have a wide variety of arrangements with such individuals. 
These individuals may be independent practitioners or employees of 
organizations furnishing various health care specialists. This provision 
does not require change in the substance of these arrangements.
    (2) If therapy services are performed under arrangements at a 
provider site on a full-time or regular part-time basis, the reasonable 
cost of such services may not exceed the amount determined by taking 
into account the total number of hours of services furnished by the 
therapist, the adjusted hourly salary equivalency amount appropriate for 
the particular therapy in the geographical area in which the services 
are furnished and a standard travel allowance.
    (3) If therapy services are performed under arrangements on a 
limited part-time or intermittent basis at the provider site, the 
reasonable cost of such services is evaluated on a reasonable rate per 
unit of service basis, except that payment for these services, in the 
aggregate, during the cost reporting period, may not exceed the amount 
that would be determined to be reasonable under paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, had a therapist furnished the provider or other organization 
furnishing the services under arrangements 15 hours of service per week 
on a regular part-time basis for the weeks in which services were 
furnished by the non-employee therapist.
    (4) If an HHA furnishes services under arrangements at the patient's 
residence or in other situations in which therapy services are not 
performed at the provider's site, the reasonable cost of such services 
is evaluated as follows:
    (i) Time records available. If time records of HHA visits are 
maintained by the provider, the reasonable cost of such services is 
evaluated on a unit-of-time basis, by taking into account the total 
number of hours of service furnished by the therapist, the adjusted 
hourly salary equivalency amount appropriate for the particular therapy 
in the geographical area in which the services are furnished, and a 
standard travel allowance for each visit. However, if the travel time of 
the therapist is accurately recorded by the therapist, and approved and 
maintained by the provider, the reasonable cost of such services may be 
evaluated, at the option of the provider, by taking into account the 
total number of hours of service furnished by the therapist, including 
travel time, and the adjusted

[[Page 417]]

hourly salary equivalency amount appropriate for the particular therapy 
in the geographical area in which the services are furnished. This 
option does not apply to services furnished by HHAs under arrangements 
with providers other than HHAs.
    (ii) No time records available. If time records are unavailable or 
found to be inaccurate, each HHA visit is considered the equivalent of 
one hour of service. In such cases, the reasonable cost of such services 
is determined by taking into account the number of visits made by the 
therapist under arrangements with such agency, the adjusted hourly 
salary equivalency amount appropriate for the particular therapy in the 
geographical area in which the services are furnished, and a standard 
travel allowance.
    (iii) Limited part-time or intermittent services. If under paragraph 
(c)(4) (i) or (ii) of this section, the provider required therapy 
services on an average of less than 15 hours per week, the services are 
considered limited part-time or intermittent services, and the 
reasonable cost of such services is evaluated on a reasonable rate per 
unit of service basis as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    (5) These provisions are applicable to individual therapy services 
or disciplines by means of separate guidelines by geographical area and 
apply to costs incurred after issuance of the guidelines but no earlier 
than the beginning of the provider's cost reporting period described in 
paragraph (a) of this section. Until a guideline is issued for a 
specific therapy or discipline, costs are evaluated so that such costs 
do not exceed what a prudent and cost-conscious buyer would pay for the 
given service,
    (d) Notice of guidelines to be imposed. Prior to the beginning of a 
period to which a guideline will be applied, a notice will be published 
in the Federal Register establishing the guideline amounts to be applied 
to each geographical area by type of therapy.
    (e) Additional allowances. (1) If a therapist supervises other 
therapists or has administrative responsibility for operating a 
provider's therapy department, a reasonable allowance may be added to 
the adjusted hourly salary equivalency amount by the intermediary based 
on its knowledge of the differential between therapy supervisors' and 
therapists' salaries in similar provider settings in the area.
    (2) If a therapist performing services under arrangements furnishes 
equipment and supplies used in furnishing therapy services, the 
guideline amount may be supplemented by the cost of the equipment and 
supplies, provided the cost does not exceed the amount the provider, as 
a prudent and cost-conscious buyer, would have been able to include as 
allowable cost.
    (f) Exceptions. The following exceptions may be granted but only 
upon the provider's demonstration that the conditions indicated are 
present:
    (1) Exception because of binding contract. A provider will be 
excepted from the provisions of this section if it has a binding 
contract in writing with a therapist or contracting organization entered 
into prior to the date guidelines are published. Before the exception 
may be granted, however, the provider must submit the contract to its 
intermediary for a determination under this paragraph, subject to review 
and approval by the Regional Office. Such an exception may be granted 
for the contract period, but not longer than one year from the date 
initial guidelines for the particular therapy are published.
    (2) Exception because of unique circumstances or special labor 
market conditions. An exception may be granted under this section by the 
intermediary if a provider demonstrates that the costs for therapy 
services established by the guideline amounts are inappropriate to a 
particular provider because of some unique circumstances or special 
labor market conditions in the area.
    (3) Exception for services furnished by risk-basis HMO providers. 
For special rules concerning services furnished to an HMO's enrollees 
who are Medicare beneficiaries by a provider owned or operated by a 
risk-basis HMO (see Sec. 417.201(b) of this chapter) or related to a 
risk-basis HMO by common ownership or control (see Sec. 417.250(c) of 
this chapter).
    (4) Exception for inpatient hospital services. Effective with cost 
reporting

[[Page 418]]

periods beginning on or after October 1, 1983, the costs of therapy 
services furnished under arrangements to a hospital inpatient are 
excepted from the guidelines issued under this section if such costs are 
subject to the provisions of Sec. 413.40 or part 412 of this chapter. 
The intermediary will grant the exception without request from the 
provider.
    (g) Appeals. A request by a provider for a hearing on the 
determination of an intermediary concerning the therapy costs determined 
to be allowable based on the provisions of this section, including a 
determination with respect to an exception under paragraph (f) of this 
section, is made to the intermediary only after submission of its cost 
report and receipt of the notice of amount of program reimbursement 
reflecting such determination, in accordance with the provisions of 
subpart R of part 405 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 413.114  Payment for posthospital SNF care furnished by a swing-bed hospital.

    (a) Purpose and basis. This section implements section 1883 of the 
Act, which provides for payment for posthospital SNF care furnished by 
rural hospitals having a swing-bed approval. Payments to these hospitals 
for posthospital SNF care furnished in general routine inpatient beds 
are based on the reasonable cost of posthospital SNF care in accordance 
with paragraph (c) of this section. Swing-bed hospitals approved after 
March 31, 1988 with more than 49 beds must meet additional payment 
requirements as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section--
    Availability date means with respect to a posthospital SNF care 
patient in a swing-bed hospital, the later of--
    (i) Any date on which a bed is available for the patient in a 
Medicare-participating SNF located within the hospital's geographic 
region;
    (ii) The date that a hospital learns that a bed is available in a 
Medicare-participating SNF; or
    (iii) If the notice is prospective, the date that a bed will become 
available in a Medicare-participating SNF.
    Geographic region means an area that includes the SNFs with which a 
hospital has traditionally arranged transfers and all other SNFs within 
the same proximity to the hospital. In the case of a hospital without 
existing transfer practices upon which to base a determination, the 
geographic region is an area that includes all the SNFs within 50 miles 
(as defined in Sec. 412.92(c)(1) of this chapter) of the hospital unless 
the hospital can demonstrate that the SNFs are inaccessible to its 
patients. In the event of a dispute as to whether an SNF is within a 
hospital's geographic region or the SNF is inaccessible to hospital 
patients, the HCFA Regional Office makes a determination.
    Swing-bed hospital means a hospital or CAH participating in Medicare 
that has an approval from HCFA to provide posthospital SNF care as 
defined in Sec. 409.20 of this chapter, and meets the requirements 
specified in Sec. 482.66 or Sec. 485.645 of this chapter, respectively.
    (c) Principle. The reasonable cost of posthospital SNF care 
furnished by a swing-bed hospital is determined as follows:
    (1) The reasonable cost of routine SNF services is based on the 
average Medicare rate per patient day for routine services provided in 
freestanding SNFs in the region where the swing-bed hospital is located. 
The rates are calculated using the regions as defined in section 
1886(d)(2)(D) of the Social Security Act. The rates are based on the 
most recent year for which settled cost reporting period data are 
available, increased in a compounded manner, using the increase 
applicable to the SNF routine cost limits, up to and including the 
calendar year for which the rates are in effect. If the current Medicare 
swing-bed rate for routine extended care services furnished by a swing-
bed hospital during a calendar year is less than the rate for the prior 
calendar year, payment is made based on the prior calendar year's rate.
    (2) The reasonable cost of ancillary services furnished as 
posthospital SNF care is determined in the same manner as the reasonable 
cost of other ancillary services furnished by the hospital in accordance 
with Sec. 413.55(a)(1).
    (d) Additional requirements--(1) General rule. Prior to Medicare 
payment being made to a swing-bed hospital

[[Page 419]]

with more than 49 beds (but fewer than 100) the following payment 
requirements must be met:
    (i) If there is an available SNF bed in the geographic region, a 
posthospital SNF care patient must be transferred within 5 days 
(excluding weekends and holidays) of the availability date, unless the 
patient's physician certifies within the 5-day period that transfer is 
not medically appropriate.
    (ii) The number of patient days for posthospital SNF care in a cost 
reporting period does not exceed 15 percent of the product of the number 
of days in the period and the average number of licensed beds in the 
hospital in the period. In those States that do not license their 
hospital beds, the hospitals must use the total number of hospital beds 
reported on their most recent Certificate of Need (CON), excluding 
bassinets. If during the cost reporting period, there is an increase or 
decrease in the number of ``licensed'' beds, the number of ``licensed'' 
beds for each part of the period is to be multiplied by the number of 
days for which that number of ``licensed'' beds was available. After 
totalling the results, compute 15 percent of the total available 
``licensed'' bed days to determine the payment limitation.
    (2) Payment restrictions. (i) The hospital must not seek payment for 
posthospital SNF care after the end of the 5 day period (excluding 
weekends and holidays) beginning on the availability date of a SNF bed 
unless the patient's physician has certified, within that 5 day period, 
that the transfer of the patient to the SNF was not medically 
appropriate.
    (ii) The hospital must not seek payment for posthospital SNF care in 
a cost reporting period to the extent that they exceed 15 percent of the 
product of the number of days in the period and the average number of 
licensed beds in the period. In those States that do not license 
hospital beds, the hospital must use the average number of hospital beds 
reported on its most recent CON, excluding bassinets.
    (3) Payment exception. Payment will continue to be made during the 
cost reporting period in which the 15 percent limit specified in 
paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section is reached for those patients who 
are receiving posthospital SNF care at the time the hospital reaches the 
limit.

Sec. 413.118  Payment for facility services related to covered ASC surgical procedures performed in hospitals on an outpatient basis.

    (a) Basis and scope. This section implements section 1833(a)(4) and 
(i)(3) of the Act and establishes the method for determining Medicare 
payments for services related to covered ambulatory surgical center 
(ASC) procedures performed in a hospital on an outpatient basis. It does 
not apply to services furnished by an ASC operated by a hospital that 
has an agreement with HCFA to be paid in accordance with Sec. 416.30 of 
this chapter. (For regulations governing ASCs see part 416 of this 
chapter.)
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section--
    Facility services are those items and services, as specified in 
Sec. 416.61 of this chapter, that are furnished by a hospital on an 
outpatient basis in connection with covered ASC surgical procedures, as 
described in Sec. 416.65 of this chapter.
    Standard overhead amount means an amount equal to the prospectively 
determined payment rate that would be paid for the procedure if it had 
been furnished by an ASC in the same geographic area.
    (c) Payment principle. The aggregate amount of payments for facility 
services, furnished in a hospital on an outpatient basis, that are 
related to covered ASC surgical procedures (covered under Sec. 416.65 of 
this chapter) is equal to the lesser of--
    (1) The hospital's reasonable cost or customary charges, as 
determined in accordance with Sec. 413.13, reduced by deductibles and 
coinsurance; or
    (2) The blended payment amount as described in paragraph (d) of this 
section, which is based on hospital-specific cost and charge data and 
rates paid to free-standing ASCs.
    (d) Blended payment amount. (1) For cost reporting periods beginning 
on or

[[Page 420]]

after October 1, 1987 but before October 1, 1988, the blended payment 
amount is equal to the sum of--
    (i) 75 percent of the hospital-specific amount (the lesser of the 
hospital's reasonable cost or customary charges, reduced by deductibles 
and coinsurance); and
    (ii) 25 percent of the ASC payment amount (that is, 80 percent of 
the result obtained by subtracting the deductibles from the sum of the 
standard overhead amounts.)
    (2) For the period of time beginning with the first day of a 
hospital's cost reporting period that begins on or after October 1, 1988 
and ends on December 31, 1990, the blended payment amount is equal to 50 
percent of the hospital-specific amount and 50 percent of the ASC 
payment amount.
    (3) For portions of cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
January 1, 1991, the blended payment amount is equal to 42 percent of 
the hospital-specific amount and 58 percent of the ASC payment amount.
    (4) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1988 
and before January 1, 1995, the blended payment amount is equal to the 
sum of 75 percent of the hospital-specific amount and 25 percent of the 
ASC payment amount for a hospital that makes an application to its 
fiscal intermediary and meets the following requirements.
    (i) More than 60 percent of the hospital's inpatient hospital 
discharges, as described in Sec. 412.60 of this chapter, occurring 
during its cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1986 
and before October 1, 1987, are classified in diagnosis related groups 
36 through 74.
    (ii) During its cost reporting period beginning on or after October 
1, 1986 and before October 1, 1987, more than 30 percent of the 
hospital's total revenues is derived from outpatient services.
    (e) Aggregation of cost, charges, and the blended amount. For 
purposes of determining the correct payment amount under paragraphs (c) 
and (d) of this section, all reasonable costs and customary charges 
attributable to facility services furnished during a cost reporting 
period are aggregated and treated separately from the reasonable costs 
and customary charges attributable to all other services furnished in 
the hospital.

determined in accordance with Sec. 413.13, reduced by the applicable 
Part B annual deductible and coinsurance amounts.
    (ii) The blended payment amount described in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section.
    (2) The blended payment amount for hospital outpatient radiology 
services furnished on or after October 1, 1988, but before October 1, 
1989, is equal to the sum of--
    (i) 65 percent of the hospital-specific amount (the hospital's 
reasonable cost or customary charges, whichever is less, reduced by the 
applicable Part B annual deductible and coinsurance amounts); and
    (ii) 35 percent of a prevailing charge or fee schedule amount that 
is calculated as 80 percent of the amount determined by subtracting the 
applicable Part B annual deductible from 62 percent of the prevailing 
charges (or for

[[Page 421]]

services furnished on or after January 1, 1989, the fee schedule amount 
established) for the same services when furnished by participating 
physicians in their offices in the same locality.
    (3) For hospital outpatient radiology services furnished on or after 
October 1, 1989, the blended payment amount is equal to the sum of 50 
percent of the hospital-specific amount and 50 percent of the fee 
schedule amount.
    (4) For hospital outpatient radiology services furnished on or after 
January 1, 1991, the blended payment amount is equal to the sum of 42 
percent of the hospital-specific amount and 58 percent of the fee 
schedule amount.
    (c) Payment for other diagnostic procedures. (1) The aggregate 
payment for other diagnostic procedures performed by a hospital on an 
outpatient basis on or after October 1, 1989 is equal to the lesser of 
the following:
    (i) The hospital's reasonable cost or customary charges, as 
determined in accordance with Sec. 414.13, reduced by the applicable 
Part B annual deductible and coinsurance amounts.
    (ii) The blended payment described in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section.
    (2) The blended payment amount for other diagnostic procedures 
furnished on or after October 1, 1989, but before October 1, 1990, is 
equal to the sum of--
    (i) 65 percent of the hospital-specific amount (the hospital's 
reasonable cost or customary charges, whichever is less, reduced by the 
applicable Part B annual deductible and coinsurance amounts); and
    (ii) 35 percent of a prevailing charge amount that is calculated as 
80 percent of the amount determined by subtracting the applicable Part B 
annual deductible from 42 percent of the prevailing charges for the same 
services furnished by participating physicians in their offices in the 
same locality.
    (3) For other diagnostic procedures performed by a hospital on or 
after October 1, 1990, the blended payment is equal to 50 percent of the 
hospital-specific amount and 50 percent of the prevailing charge amount.

                    Subpart G--Capital-Related Costs


<R05>
Sec. 413.130  Introduction to capital-related costs.

    (a) General rule. Capital-related costs and an allowance for return 
on equity are limited to the following:
    (1) Net depreciation expense as determined under Secs. 413.134, 
413.144, and 413.149, adjusted by gains and losses realized from the 
disposal of depreciable assets under Sec. 413.134(f).
    (2) Taxes on land or depreciable assets used for patient care.
    (3) Leases and rentals, including license and royalty fees, for the 
use of depreciable assets or land, as described in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (4) The costs of betterments and improvements as described in 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (5) The costs of minor equipment that are capitalized, rather than 
expensed, as described in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (6) Insurance expense on depreciable assets, as described in 
paragraph (e) of this section.
    (7) Interest expense as determined under Sec. 413.153, subject to 
the qualifications of paragraph (f) of this section.
    (8) For certain proprietary providers, return on equity capital, as 
determined under Sec. 413.157.
    (9) The capital-related costs of related organizations (as described 
in Sec. 413.17), as determined in accordance with paragraph (g) of this 
section.
    (10) Debt issuance costs, debt discounts, and debt redemption costs, 
if the associated debt was incurred to acquire land or depreciable 
assets used for patient care or to refinance existing debt for which the 
original purpose was to acquire land or depreciable assets used for 
patient care.
    (11) The apportionment of the capital-related costs of jointly owned 
assets among the owners must be on a basis that reflects the relative 
use by each owner, rather than the ownership share or the amount of time 
the asset is located at each owners site.
    (b) Leases and rentals. (1) Subject to the qualifications of 
paragraphs (b) (2), (4), (5), and (8) of this section, leases and 
rentals, including licenses and royalty fees, are includable in capital-
related costs if they relate to the use of assets that would be 
depreciable if the provider owned them outright or they relate to land, 
which is neither depreciable nor amortizable if owned outright. The 
terms ``leases'' and ``rentals of assets'' signify that a provider has 
possession, use, and enjoyment of the assets.
    (2) For sale and leaseback agreements for hospitals and SNFs entered 
into before October 23, 1992 and for sale and leaseback agreements for 
other providers entered into at any time, a provider may include 
incurred rental charges in its capital-related costs, as specified in a 
sale and leaseback agreement with a nonrelated purchaser (including 
shared service organizations not related within the meaning of 
Sec. 413.17) involving plant facilities or equipment only if the 
following conditions are met:
    (i) The rental charges are reasonable based on the following--
    (A) Consideration of rental charges of comparable facilities and 
market conditions in the area;
    (B) The type, expected life, condition, and value of the facilities 
or equipment rented; and
    (C) Other provisions of the rental agreements.
    (ii) Adequate alternative facilities or equipment that would serve 
the purpose are not or were not available at lower cost.
    (iii) The leasing was based on economic and technical 
considerations.
    (3) If the conditions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section are not 
met, the amount a provider may include in its capital-related costs as 
rental or lease expense under a sale and leaseback agreement may not 
exceed the amount that the provider would have included in its capital-
related costs had the provider retained legal title to the facilities or 
equipment, such as interest on mortgage, taxes, depreciation, and 
insurance costs.
    (4) For sale and leaseback agreements for hospitals and SNFs entered 
into on or after October 23, 1992, the amount a provider may include in 
its capital-related costs as rental or lease expense may not exceed the 
amount that the provider would have included

[[Page 423]]

in its capital-related costs had the provider retained legal title to 
the facilities or equipment, such as interest expense on mortgages, 
taxes, depreciation, and insurance costs (the costs of ownership). This 
limitation applies both on an annual basis and over the useful life of 
the asset.
    (i) If in the early years of the lease, the annual rental or lease 
costs are less than the annual costs of ownership, but in the later 
years of the lease the annual rental or lease costs are more than the 
annual costs of ownership, in the years that the annual rental or lease 
costs are more than the annual costs of ownership, the provider may 
include in capital-related costs annually the actual amount of rental or 
lease costs. The aggregate rental or lease costs included in capital-
related costs may not exceed the aggregate costs of ownership that would 
have been included in capital-related costs over the useful life of the 
asset had the provider retained legal title to the asset.
    (ii) If in the early years of the lease, the annual rental or lease 
costs exceed the annual costs of ownership, but in the later years of 
the lease the annual rental or lease costs are less than the annual 
costs of ownership, the provider may carry forward amounts of rental or 
lease costs that were not included in capital-related costs in the early 
years of the lease due to the costs of ownership limitation, and include 
these amounts in capital-related costs in the years of the lease when 
the annual rental or lease costs are less than the annual costs of 
ownership.
    (iii) In any given year the amount of actual annual rental or lease 
costs plus the amount carried forward to that year may not exceed the 
amount of the costs of ownership for that year.
    (iv) In the aggregate, the amount of rental or lease costs included 
in capital-related costs may not exceed the amount of the costs of 
ownership that the provider could have included in capital-related costs 
had the provider retained legal title to the asset.
    (5) For lease purchase transactions entered into before October 23, 
1992, a lease that meets the following conditions establishes a virtual 
purchase:
    (i) The rental charge exceeds rental charges of comparable 
facilities or equipment in the area.
    (ii) The term of the lease is less than the useful life of the 
facilities or equipment.
    (iii) The provider has the option to renew the lease at a 
significantly reduced rental, or the provider has the right to purchase 
the facilities or equipment at a price that appears to be significantly 
less than what the fair market value of the facilities or equipment 
would be at the time acquisition by the provider is permitted.
    (6)(i) If a lease is a virtual purchase under paragraph (b)(5) of 
this section, the rental charge is includable in capital-related costs 
only to the extent that it does not exceed the amount that the provider 
would have included in capital-related costs if it had legal title to 
the asset (the cost of ownership), such as straight-line depreciation, 
insurance, and interest. A provider may not include in its capital-
related costs accelerated depreciation in this situation.
    (ii) The difference between the amount of rent paid and the amount 
of rent allowed as capital-related costs is considered a deferred charge 
and is capitalized as part of the historical cost of the asset when the 
asset is purchased.
    (iii) If an asset is returned to the owner, instead of being 
purchased, the deferred charge may be included in capital-related costs 
in the year the asset is returned.
    (iv) If the term of the lease is extended for an additional period 
of time at a reduced lease cost and the option to purchase still exists, 
the deferred charge may be included in capital-related costs to the 
extent of increasing the reduced rental to an amount not in excess of 
the cost of ownership.
    (v) If the term of the lease is extended for an additional period of 
time at a reduced lease cost and the option to purchase no longer 
exists, the deferred charge may be included in the capital-related costs 
to the extent of increasing the reduced rental to a fair rental value.
    (7) Amounts included in lease or rental payments for repair or 
maintenance agreements are excluded from capital-

[[Page 424]]

related costs. If no amount is identified in the lease or rental 
agreement for maintenance, the entire lease payment is considered a 
capital-related cost subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section.
    (8) For lease purchase transactions entered into on or after October 
23, 1992, a lease that meets any one of the following conditions 
establishes a virtual purchase:
    (i) The lease transfers title of the facilities or equipment to the 
lessee during the lease term.
    (ii) The lease contains a bargain purchase option.
    (iii) The lease term is at least 75 percent of the useful life of 
the facilities or equipment. This provision is not applicable if the 
lease begins in the last 25 percent of the useful life of the facilities 
or equipment.
    (iv) The present value of the minimum lease payments (payments to be 
made during the lease term including bargain purchase option, guaranteed 
residual value, and penalties for failure to renew) equals at least 90 
percent of the fair market value of the leased property. This provision 
is not applicable if the lease begins in the last 25 percent of the 
useful life of the facilities or equipment. Present value is computed 
using the lessee's incremental borrowing rate, unless the interest rate 
implicit in the lease is known and is less than the lessee's incremental 
borrowing rate, in which case the interest rate implicit in the lease is 
used.
    (9)(i) If a lease establishes a virtual purchase under paragraph 
(b)(8) of this section, the rental charge is includable in capital-
related costs to the extent that it does not exceed the amount that the 
provider would have included in capital-related costs if it had legal 
title to the asset (the cost of ownership). The cost of ownership 
includes straight-line depreciation, insurance, and interest. For 
purposes of computing the limitation on allowable rental cost in this 
paragraph, a provider may not include accelerated depreciation.
    (ii) The difference between the amount of rent paid and the amount 
of rent allowed as capital-related costs is considered a deferred charge 
and is capitalized as part of the historical cost of the asset when the 
asset is purchased.
    (iii) If an asset is returned to the owner instead of being 
purchased, the deferred charge may be included in capital-related costs 
in the year the asset is returned.
    (iv) If the term of the lease is extended for an additional period 
of time at a reduced lease cost and the option to purchase still exists, 
the deferred charge may be included in capital-related costs to the 
extent of increasing the reduced rental to an amount not in excess of 
the cost of ownership.
    (v) If the term of the lease is extended for an additional period of 
time at a reduced lease cost and the option to purchase no longer 
exists, the deferred charge may be included in capital-related costs to 
the extent of increasing the reduced rental to a fair rental value.
    (vi) If the lessee becomes the owner of the leased asset (either by 
operation of the lease or by other means), the amount considered as 
depreciation, for the purpose of having computed the limitation on 
rental charges in paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section, must be used in 
calculating the limitation on adjustments for the purpose of determining 
any gain or loss under Sec. 413.134(f) upon disposal of an asset.
    (c) Betterments and improvements. (1) Betterments and improvements 
are changes which extend the estimated useful life of an asset at least 
two years beyond its original estimated useful life, or increase the 
productivity of an asset significantly over its original productivity.
    (2) A provider must capitalize and prorate the costs of betterments 
and improvements over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset, 
as modified by the betterment or improvement.
    (d) Minor equipment. A provider must include in its capital-related 
costs the costs of minor equipment that are capitalized rather than 
charged off to expense if--
    (1) The net book value of minor equipment at the time the provider 
enters the program is prorated over three years (that is, one-third of 
the net book value is written off each year),

[[Page 425]]

and new purchases are also prorated over a 3-year period; or
    (2) The cost of minor equipment is prorated over their actual useful 
lives.
    (e) Insurance. (1) A provider must include in its capital-related 
costs the costs of insurance on depreciable assets used for patient care 
or insurance that provides for the payment of capital-related costs 
during business interruption.
    (2) If an insurance policy also provides protection for other than 
the replacement of depreciable assets or to pay capital-related costs in 
the case of business interruption insurance, only that portion of the 
premium related to the replacement of depreciable assets or to pay 
capital-related costs in the case of business interruption insurance is 
includable in capital-related costs.
    (f) Debt premiums and debt discounts. Debt premiums or debt discount 
are applied as adjustments to capital-related costs if the associated 
debt is incurred for acquiring land or depreciable assets used for 
patient care or for refinancing existing debt for which the original 
purpose was to acquire land or depreciable assets used for patient care.
    (g) Interest expense. (1) A provider must include in its capital-
related costs interest expense, as described in Sec. 413.153, if such 
expense is incurred in--
    (i) Acquiring land or depreciable assets (either through purchase or 
lease) used for patient care; or
    (ii) Refinancing existing debt, if the original purpose of the 
refinanced debt was to acquire land or depreciable assets used for 
patient care.
    (2) If investment income offset is required under 
Sec. 413.153(b)(2)(iii), only that portion of investment income that 
bears the same relationship to total investment income, as the portion 
of capital-related interest expense bears to total interest expense, is 
offset against capital-related costs.
    (h) Costs of supplying organizations--(1) Supplying organizations 
related to the provider. (i) If the supplying organization is related to 
the provider within the meaning of Sec. 413.17, except as provided in 
paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, a provider's capital-related costs 
include the capital-related costs of the supplying organization.
    (ii) If the costs of the services, facilities or supplies being 
furnished exceed the open market price, or if the provisions of 
Sec. 413.17(d) apply, no part of the cost to the provider of the 
services, facilities, or supplies are considered capital-related costs, 
unless the services, facilities, or supplies would otherwise be 
considered capital-related.
    (2) Supplying organizations not related to the provider. If the 
supplying organization is not related to the provider within the meaning 
of Sec. 413.17, no part of the charge to the provider may be considered 
a capital-related cost (unless the services, facilities, or supplies are 
capital-related in nature) unless--
    (i) The capital-related equipment is leased or rented (as described 
in paragraph (b) of this section) by the provider;
    (ii) The capital-related equipment is located on the provider's 
premises, or is located offsite and is on real estate owned, leased or 
rented by the provider; and
    (iii) The capital-related portion of the charge is separately 
specified in the charge to the provider.
    (i) Costs excluded from capital-related costs. The following costs 
are not capital-related costs. To the extent that they are allowable, 
they must be included in determining each provider's operating costs:
    (1) Costs incurred for the repair or maintenance of equipment or 
facilities.
    (2) Amounts included in rentals or lease payments for repair or 
maintenance agreements.
    (3) Interest expense incurred to borrow working capital (for 
operating expenses).
    (4) General liability insurance or any other form of insurance to 
provide protection other than for the replacement of depreciable assets 
or to pay capital-related costs in the case of business interruption.
    (5) Taxes other than those assessed on the basis of some valuation 
of land or depreciable assets used for patient care. (Taxes not related 
to patient care, such as income taxes, are not allowable, and are 
therefore not included among either capital-related or operating costs.)
    (6) The costs of minor equipment that are charged off to expense 
rather

[[Page 426]]

than capitalized as described in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (7) The costs incurred for maintenance and repair insurance 
agreements (commonly referred to as maintenance agreements).
    (j) Reduction to capital-related costs. (1) Except for sole 
community hospitals and critical access hospitals, the amount of 
capital-related costs of all hospital outpatient services is reduced 
by--
    (i) 15 percent for portions of cost reporting periods occurring on 
or after October 1, 1989, through September 30, 1991; and
    (ii) 10 percent for portions of cost reporting periods occurring on 
or after October 1, 1991, through September 30, 1998.
    (2) For purposes of determining the blended payment amounts for 
hospital outpatient services under Sec. 413.118 and Sec. 413.122, the 
reduction is applicable only to the hospital-specific portion of the 
blended amounts.

Sec. 413.134  Depreciation: Allowance for depreciation based on asset costs.

    (a) Principle. An appropriate allowance for depreciation on 
buildings and equipment used in the provision of patient care is an 
allowable cost. The depreciation must be--
    (1) Identifiable and recorded in the provider's accounting records;
    (2) Based on the historical cost of the asset, except as specified 
in paragraph (j) of this section regarding donated assets; and
    (3) Prorated over the estimated useful life of the asset using--
    (i) The straight-line method; or
    (ii) Accelerated depreciation under a declining balance method (not 
to exceed double the straight-line rate) or the sum-of-the-years' digits 
method in the following situations:
    (A) Depreciable assets for which accelerated depreciation was used 
for Medicare purposes before August 1, 1970, including those assets for 
which a timely request to change from straight-line depreciation to 
accelerated depreciation was received by an intermediary before August 
1, 1970;
    (B) Depreciable assets acquired before August 1, 1970, if no 
election to use straight-line or accelerated depreciation was in effect 
on August 1, 1970, and the provider was participating in the program on 
August 1, 1970;
    (C) Depreciable assets of a provider if construction of such 
depreciable asset began before February 5, 1970, and the provider was 
participating in the program on February 5, 1970; or
    (D) Depreciable assets of a provider if a valid written contract was 
entered into by a provider participating in the program before February 
5, 1970, for construction, acquisition, or for the permanent financing 
thereof, and such contract was binding on a provider on February 5, 
1970, and at all times thereafter; or
    (iii) A declining balance method, not to exceed 150 percent of the 
straight-line rate, for a depreciable asset acquired after July 31, 
1970; however, this declining balance method may be used only if the 
cash flow from depreciation on the total assets of the institution 
during the reporting period, including straight-line depreciation on the 
assets in question, is insufficient (assuming funding of available 
capital not required currently for amortization and assuming reasonable 
interest income on such funds) to supply the funds required to meet the 
reasonable principal amortization schedules on the capital debts related 
to the provider's total depreciable assets. For each depreciable asset 
for which a provider requests authorization to use a declining balance 
method for Medicare reimbursement purposes, but not to exceed 150 
percent of the straight-line rate, the provider must demonstrate to the 
intermediary's satisfaction that the required cash flow need exists. For 
each depreciable asset in which a provider justifies the use of 
accelerated depreciation, the intermediary must give written approval 
for the use of a depreciation method other than straight-line before 
basing any interim payment on this accelerated depreciation or making 
its reasonable cost determination which includes an allowance for such 
depreciation.

[[Page 427]]

    (b) General rules. (1) Historical cost. Historical cost is the cost 
incurred by the present owner in acquiring the asset.
    (i) All providers. For depreciable assets acquired after July 31, 
1970, and for a hospital or a SNF, acquired before July 18, 1984, the 
historical cost may not exceed the lower of current reproduction cost 
adjusted for straight-line depreciation over the life of the asset to 
the time of the purchase or the fair market value of the asset at the 
time of its purchase.
    (ii) Hospitals and SNFs only. (A) For assets acquired on or after 
July 18, 1984 and not subject to an enforceable agreement entered into 
before that date, historical cost may not exceed the lowest of the 
following:
    (1) The allowable acquisition cost of the asset to the owner of 
record as of July 18, 1984 (or, in the case of an asset not in existence 
as of July 18, 1984, the first owner of record of the asset after that 
date);
    (2) The acquisition cost of the asset to the new owner; or
    (3) The fair market value of the asset on the date of acquisition.
    (B) For purposes of applying paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this 
section, an asset not in existence as of July 18, 1984 includes any 
asset that physically existed, but was not owned by a hospital or SNF 
participating in the Medicare program as of July 18, 1984.
    (C) The acquisition cost to the owner of record is subject to any 
limitation on historical costs described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) or 
(g)(1) and (2) of this section, and is not reduced by any depreciation 
taken by the owner of record. This limitation on historical cost is also 
applied to the purchase of land, a capital asset that is neither 
depreciable nor amortizable under any circumstances. (See 
Secs. 413.153(d) and 413.157(b) for application of the limitation to the 
cost of land for purposes of determining allowable interest expense and 
return on equity capital or proprietary providers.)
    (D) Acquisition cost to the owner of record includes the costs of 
betterments or improvements that extend the estimated useful life of an 
asset at least two years beyond its original estimated useful life or 
increase the productivity of an asset significantly over its original 
productivity.
    (E) For assets acquired prior to a hospital's or SNF's entrance into 
the Medicare program, the acquisition cost to the owner of record is the 
historical cost of the asset when acquired, rather than when the 
hospital or SNF entered the program.
    (F) For assets subject to the optional depreciation allowance as 
described in Sec. 413.139, the acquisition cost to the owner of record 
is the historical cost established for those assets when the hospital or 
SNF changed to actual depreciation as described in Sec. 413.139(e). If 
the hospital or SNF did not change to actual depreciation, as described 
in Sec. 413.139(e), for optional allowance assets, the acquisition cost 
to the owner of record is established by reference to the hospital's or 
SNF's recorded historical cost of the asset when acquired. If the 
hospital or SNF has no historical cost records for optional allowance 
assets, the acquisition cost to the owner of record is established by 
appraisal.
    (G) The historical cost of an asset acquired on or after July 18, 
1984 may not include costs attributable to the negotiation or settlement 
of the sale or purchase (by acquisition, merger, or consolidation) of 
any capital asset for which any payment was previously made under the 
Medicare program. The costs to be excluded include, but are not limited 
to, appraisal costs (except those incurred at the request of the 
intermediary under paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section), legal fees, 
accounting and administrative costs, travel costs, and the costs of 
feasibility studies.
    (iii) Hospital-based providers other than SNFs and SNF-based 
providers. For changes of ownership that involve assets of a hospital-
based provider other than a SNF, or assets of a SNF-based provider, the 
provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section are not applicable. A 
reasonable allocation of the purchase price must be made, so that the 
hospital-based provider other than a SNF, or a SNF-based provider, is 
not affected by the limitations described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of 
this section. The historical cost of assets of providers other than 
hospitals and SNFs is governed by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.

[[Page 428]]

    (2) Fair market value. Fair market value is the price that the asset 
would bring by bona fide bargaining between well-informed buyers and 
sellers at the date of acquisition. Usually the fair market price is the 
price that bona fide sales have been consummated for assets of like 
type, quality, and quantity in a particular market at the time of 
acquisition.
    (3) The straight-line method. Under the straight-line method of 
depreciation, the cost or other basis (for example, fair market value in 
the case of donated assets) of the asset, less its estimated salvage 
value, if any, is determined first. Then this amount is distributed in 
equal amounts over the period of the estimated useful life of the asset.
    (4) Declining balance method. Under the declining balance method, 
the annual depreciation allowance is computed by multiplying the 
undepreciated cost of the asset each year by a uniform rate up to double 
the straight-line rate or 150 percent, as the case may be (see paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section for limitations on use of accelerated methods of 
depreciation).
    (5) Sum-of-the-years' digits method. Under the sum-of-the-years' 
digits method, the annual depreciation allowance is computed by 
multiplying the depreciable cost basis (cost less salvage value) by a 
constantly decreasing fraction. The numerator of the fraction is 
represented by the remaining years of useful life of the asset at the 
beginning of each year, and the denominator is always represented by the 
sum of the years' digits of useful life at the time of acquisition.
    (6) Current reproduction cost. Current reproduction cost is the cost 
at current prices, in a particular locality or market area, of 
reproducing an item of property or a group of assets. Where depreciable 
assets are concerned, this means the reasonable cost to have built, 
reproduce in kind, or, in the case of equipment or similar assets, to 
purchase in the competitive market.
    (7) Useful life. The estimated useful life of a depreciable asset is 
its normal operating or service life to the provider, subject to the 
provisions in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section. Factors to be 
considered in determining useful life include normal wear and tear; 
obsolescence due to normal economic and technological changes; climatic 
and other local conditions; and the provider's policy for repairs and 
replacement.
    (i) Initial selection of useful life. In selecting a proper useful 
life for computing depreciation under the Medicare program, providers 
must use the useful life guidelines published by HCFA. If HCFA has not 
published applicable useful life guidelines, providers must use--
    (A) The edition of the American Hospital Association useful life 
guidelines, as specified in HCFA Medicare program manuals; or
    (B) A different useful life specifically requested by the provider 
and approved by the intermediary. A different useful life may be 
approved by the intermediary if the provider's request is properly 
supported by acceptable factors that affect the determination of useful 
life. However, such factors as an expected early sale, retirement, 
demolition or abandonment of an asset, or termination of the provider 
from the Medicare program may not be used.
    (ii) Application of guidelines. The provisions concerning the 
selection of useful life guidelines described in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of 
this section apply to assets acquired on or after January 1, 1981. For 
assets acquired before January 1, 1981, providers must use the useful 
life guidelines published by the American Hospital Association in its 
1973 edition of Chart of Accounts for Hospitals, or those published by 
the Internal Revenue Service, or those approved for use by 
intermediaries as provided in paragraph (b)(7)(i)(B) of this section.
    (iii) Changing useful life. A change in the estimated useful life 
may be made if clear and convincing evidence justifies a redetermination 
of the useful life used by the provider. Such a change must be approved 
by the intermediary in writing, and the factors cited in paragraphs 
(b)(7) and (b)(7)(i) of this section are applicable in making such 
redeterminations of useful life. If the request is approved, the change 
is effective with the reporting period immediately following the period 
in which the provider's request is submitted for approval.

[[Page 429]]

    (8) Donated asset. An asset is considered donated when the provider 
acquires the asset without making payment in the form of cash, new debt, 
assumed debt, property or services. Except as provided in paragraph 
(j)(3) of this section, if a provider makes payment in any form to 
acquire an asset, the payment is considered the purchase price for the 
purpose of determining allowable historical cost.
    (9) Net book value. The net book value of an asset is the 
depreciable basis used for the Medicare program by the asset's last 
participating owner less depreciation recognized under the Medicare 
program.
    (c) Recording of depreciation. Appropriate recording of depreciation 
includes the identification of the depreciable assets in use, the 
assets' historical costs, the assets' dates of acquisition, the method 
of depreciation, estimated useful lives, and the assets' accumulated 
depreciation.
    (d) Depreciation methods--(1) General. Proration of the cost of an 
asset over its useful life is allowed on the straight-line method, or, 
when permitted under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the declining 
balance or the sum-of-the-years' digits methods. One method may be used 
on a single asset or group of assets and another method on others. In 
applying the declining balance or sum-of-the-years' digits method to an 
asset that is not new, the undepreciated cost of the asset is treated as 
the cost of a new asset in computing depreciation.
    (2) Change in method. Prior to August 1, 1970, a provider may change 
from the straight-line method to an accelerated method or vice versa, 
upon advance approval from the intermediary on a prospective basis with 
the request being made before the end of the first month of the 
prospective reporting period. Only one such change with respect to a 
particular asset may be made by a provider. Effective with August 1, 
1970, a provider may only change from an accelerated method or optional 
method (see Sec. 413.139) to the straight-line method. Such a change may 
be made without intermediary approval and the basis for depreciation is 
the undepreciated cost reduced by the salvage value. Thereafter, once 
straight-line depreciation is selected for a particular asset, an 
accelerated method may not be established for that asset.
    (3) Recovery of accelerated depreciation--(i) General. If a provider 
who has used an accelerated method of depreciation for any of its assets 
terminates participation in the program, or if the Medicare proportion 
of its allowable costs decreases so that cumulatively substantially more 
depreciation was paid than would have been paid using the straight-line 
method of depreciation, the excess of reimbursable cost determined by 
using accelerated depreciation methods and paid under the program over 
the reimbursable cost that would have been determined and paid under the 
program by using the straight-line method of depreciation, will be 
recovered as an offset to current reimbursement due or, if the provider 
has terminated participation in the program, as an overpayment. In this 
determination of excess payment, recognition will be given to the 
effects the adjustment to straight-line depreciation would have on the 
return on equity capital and on the allowance in lieu of specific 
recognition of other costs in the respective years.
    (ii) Transaction between related organizations--(A) General. If the 
termination of the provider agreement is due to a change in provider 
ownership, as defined in Sec. 489.18 of this chapter, resulting from a 
transaction between related organizations, as defined in Sec. 413.17, 
and the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section are met, the excess of 
reimbursable cost, as determined in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section 
may not be recovered if there is a continuation of participation by the 
facility in the Medicare program.
    (B) Criteria. The following criteria must be met if the recovery of 
excess reimbursable cost is not to be made:
    (1) The termination of the provider agreement is due to a change in 
ownership of the provider resulting from a transaction between related 
organizations.
    (2) The successor provider continues to participate in the Medicare 
program.
    (3) Control and the extent of the financial interest of the owners 
of the

[[Page 430]]

provider before and after the termination remain the same; that is, the 
successor owners acquire the same per-centage of control or financial 
investment as the transferors had.
    (4) All assets and liabilities of the terminated provider are 
transferred to the related successor participating provider.
    (C) Effect of transaction. In transactions meeting the criteria 
specified in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, the provision 
concerning recovery of excess reimbursable cost (Sec. 413.134(d)(3)(i)) 
is not applied, and the transaction is treated as follows:
    (1) The successor provider must record the historical cost and 
accumulated depreciation and the method of depreciation recognized under 
the Medicare program, and these are considered as incurred by the 
successor provider for Medicare purposes.
    (2) The Medicare program's utilization of the terminated provider is 
considered as having been incurred by the successor provider for 
Medicare purposes.
    (3) The equity capital of the terminated provider as of the closing 
of its final cost reporting period must be wholly contained in the 
equity capital of the successor provider as of the beginning of its 
first cost reporting period.
    (e) Funding of depreciation. Although funding of depreciation is not 
required, it is strongly recommended that providers use this mechanism 
as a means of conserving funds for replacement of depreciable assets. 
Funded depreciation account funds must be placed in readily marketable 
investments of the type that assures the availability and conservation 
of the funds. Additions to the funded depreciation account must remain 
in the account for at least 6 months to be considered valid funding 
transactions.
    (1) Incentive. As an incentive for funding, investment income on 
funded depreciation is not treated as a reduction of allowable interest 
expense provided such investment income is deposited in, and becomes 
part of, the funded depreciation account at the time of receipt by the 
provider. Investment income earned on deposits before the 6-month period 
elapses are not offset unless the deposits are withdrawn for an improper 
purpose during this period. If a provider transfers assets of the funded 
depreciation account to a related organization (for example, pooling of 
several chain organization providers' funded depreciation accounts at 
the chain home office for investment purposes), these assets shall be 
treated as the provider's funds and are subject to all the requirements 
specified in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (2) Availability of funded depreciation. (i) HCFA considers funded 
depreciation available for use in the acquisition or replacement of 
depreciable assets related to patient care unless the funded 
depreciation funds have been committed by contract for the acquisition 
of depreciable assets related to the furnishing of patient care or for 
other capital purposes related to patient care.
    (ii) Borrowing for a purpose for which funded depreciation account 
funds should have been used makes the borrowing unnecessary to the 
extent that funded depreciation account funds were available at the time 
of the borrowing. Available funds in the funded depreciation account, to 
the extent of the unnecessary borrowing, are called ``tainted'' funds. 
Interest expense incurred on borrowing for a capital purpose is not an 
allowable cost to the extent that funded depreciation account funds were 
available at the time of the borrowing.
    (iii) A provider can remove the ``unnecessary'' characterization of 
borrowing, and thereby cure tainted funded depreciation, by using the 
tainted funds for a proper purpose described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of 
this section. However, any funded depreciation that existed at the time 
of the unnecessary borrowing and is not classified as tainted must be 
used before any of the tainted funds.
    (iv) When only a portion of the borrowing is considered unnecessary 
under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, subsequent repayments of 
such borrowing from general funds are applied first to the allowable 
portion of the borrowing and then, when all of the allowable borrowing 
is repaid, to the unallowable portion of the borrowing. When funds from 
the funded depreciation account are used for the repayment of the 
unnecessary borrowing, an equivalent

[[Page 431]]

amount of tainted funds is cured without regard to the provisions of 
paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) and (e)(3)(i)(C) of this section. Similarly, where 
general funds are used to pay for the unallowable borrowing after the 
necessary borrowing has been repaid, an equivalent amount of tainted 
funded depreciation is cured without regard to the provisions of 
paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) and (e)(3)(i)(C) of this section.
    (3) Withdrawals of funded depreciation--(i) Proper withdrawals. (A) 
Withdrawals from funded depreciation are considered proper if made 
either for the acquisition or replacement of depreciable assets related 
to the furnishing of patient care or for other capital purposes related 
to patient care.
    (B) First-in, first-out basis. Proper withdrawals from funded 
depreciation are made on a first-in, first-out basis.
    (C) Exception. If HCFA determines that a borrowing is unnecessary 
because of the existence of available funded depreciation, and 
additional deposits have been made to funded depreciation after the 
occurrence of the unnecessary borrowing, withdrawals made after the date 
of the additional deposits are deemed to be made on a last-in, first-out 
basis.
    (ii) Improper withdrawals. (A) Withdrawals from funded depreciation 
that do not meet the requirements for proper withdrawals under the 
provisions in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A) of this section are considered 
improper withdrawals.
    (B) Improper withdrawals from funded depreciation are made on a 
last-in, first-out basis. If improper withdrawals are made, interest 
expense is reduced in accordance with section Sec. 413.153(c)(3).
    (C) Improper withdrawals will result in the offset of otherwise 
allowable interest expense under the offset provisions in 
Sec. 413.153(c)(3).
    (4) Loans from funded depreciation. (i) When the general fund of the 
provider borrows from the funded depreciation to obtain working capital 
for normal operating expenses to furnish patient care, interest incurred 
by the general fund is an allowable operating cost only if the interest 
expense is supported by documents that evidence that the funds were 
borrowed and that payment of interest and repayment of the funds are 
required, is separately identified in the provider's accounting records, 
and meets the necessary and proper tests described in 
Secs. 413.153(b)(2) and (b)(3). However, if the general fund of the 
provider borrows from the funded depreciation account to acquire 
depreciable assets used in furnishing patient care, or for other capital 
purposes related to patient care, interest expense paid by the general 
fund to the funded depreciation account is not an allowable cost. 
Providers are expected to use the funded depreciation for these 
purposes.
    (ii) Loans from funded depreciation to the general fund are 
considered investments of funded depreciation, but do not have to meet 
the readily marketable test described in paragraph (e) of this section. 
Loans made from funded depreciation are subject to the requirement that 
funded depreciation must be available for the acquisition of depreciable 
assets used to furnish patient care, or for other capital purposes 
related to patient care. Costs incurred to secure lines of credit from 
lending institutions to ensure such availability are not allowable 
costs.
    (iii) Funding of depreciation from general funds will not be 
recognized to the extent of any outstanding loans from the funded 
depreciation account to the general fund. Deposits from the general fund 
into the funded depreciation account must be first applied to reduce any 
loans outstanding from the funded depreciation to the general fund. When 
the loans are repaid in full, general funds deposited in the funded 
depreciation account are considered as repayments of the general fund. 
Therefore, any subsequent interest expense of the general fund paid to 
the funded depreciation fund is not an allowable cost.
    (iv) A provider may loan its funded depreciation to a related 
organization for any purpose subject to the following conditions:
    (A) Authorization for such a loan by the provider's appropriate 
managing body of the provider, such as Board of Trustees or Board of 
Directors, must be on file.
    (B) The funded depreciation loaned must remain available, as 
specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, to the

[[Page 432]]

provider making the loan. Costs incurred for lines of credit to assure 
such availability are not allowable costs. During the period of time 
that the loan is outstanding, if the provider making the loan resorts to 
outside borrowing for a purpose for which its funded depreciation should 
have been used, interest expense on an amount of the outside borrowing 
up to the amount of the funded depreciation that should have been 
available would be disallowed as unnecessary.
    (C) Such loans shall be considered investments of the provider's 
funded depreciation, but the requirement that funded depreciation be 
invested in readily marketable investments as required in paragraph (e) 
of this section is waived for such loans.
    (D) The funded depreciation account must earn interest on such loans 
at a rate that does not exceed the rate that would be charged for a 
comparable loan from an independent lending institution. This investment 
income will not be used to reduce the provider's interest expense if all 
the other conditions in paragraph (e) of this section are met. If the 
entity borrowing the funds is another provider participating in the 
Medicare program, the interest expense incurred on such loans would be 
allowable if the loan meets all of the interest expense requirements 
specified in Sec. 413.153. (For purposes of Sec. 413.153(b)(3)(ii), such 
loans are not considered to be with a related lender.)
    (f) Gains and losses on disposal of assets--(1) General. Depreciable 
assets may be disposed of through sale, scrapping, trade-in, exchange, 
demolition, abandonment, condemnation, fire, theft, or other casualty. 
If disposal of a depreciable asset results in a gain or loss, an 
adjustment is necessary in the provider's allowable cost. The amount of 
a gain included in the determination of allowable cost is limited to the 
amount of depreciation previously included in Medicare allowable costs. 
The amount of a loss to be included is limited to the undepreciated 
basis of the asset permitted under the program. The treatment of the 
gain or loss depends upon the manner of disposition of the asset, as 
specified in paragraphs (f) (2) through (6) of this section. The gain or 
loss on the disposition of depreciable assets has no retroactive effect 
on a proprietary provider's equity capital for years prior to the year 
of disposition.
    (2) Bona fide sale or scrapping. (i) Except as specified in 
paragraph (f)(3) of this section, gains and losses realized from the 
bona fide sale or scrapping of depreciable assets are included in the 
determination of allowable cost only if the sale or scrapping occurs 
while the provider is participating in Medicare. The extent to which 
such gains and losses are included is calculated by prorating the basis 
for depreciation of the asset in accordance with the proportion of the 
asset's useful life for which the provider participated in Medicare. For 
purposes of this paragraph (f)(2)(i), scrapping refers to the physical 
removal from the provider's premises of tangible personal properties 
that are no longer useful for their intended purpose and are only 
salable for their scrap or junk value.
    (ii) If the total amount of gains or losses realized from bona fide 
sales or scrapping does not exceed $5,000 within the cost reporting 
period or if the provider's cumulative utilization under the Medicare 
program is less than 5 percent, the net amount of gains or losses 
realized from sale or scrapping will be allowed as a depreciation 
adjustment in the period of disposal. For purposes of this paragraph 
(f)(2)(ii), the provider's cumulative Medicare utilization precentage is 
determined by comparing the cumulative total of the Medicare inpatient 
days for all reporting periods in which depreciation on the asset 
disposed of was claimed under the Medicare program to the cumulative 
total of inpatient days of the participating provider for the same 
reporting periods.
    (iii) If the conditions specified in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this 
section are not met, the adjustment to reimbursable cost in the 
reporting period of asset disposition is calculated as follows:
    (A) The total amount of gains or losses shall be allocated to all 
reporting periods under the Medicare program, based on the ratio of the 
depreciation allowed on the assets in each

[[Page 433]]

reporting period to the total depreciation allowed under the Medicare 
program.
    (B) The results of this allocation are multiplied by the ratio of 
Medicare reimbursable cost to total allowable cost for each reporting 
period.
    (C) The results of this multiplication are then added.
    (D) Effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 1991, no adjustment will be made for the portion of gains or 
losses allocated to inpatient hospital services for which the hospital 
was paid under the fully prospective payment methodology as described in 
Sec. 412.340 of this chapter or under the hold-harmless methodology 
based on the Federal rate as described in Sec. 412.344(a)(1) of this 
chapter for new capital costs or in Sec. 412.344(a)(2) of this chapter.
    (iv) If a provider sells more than one asset for a lump sum sales 
price, the gain or loss on the sale of each depreciable asset must be 
determined by allocating the lump sum sales price among all the assets 
sold, in accordance with the fair market value of each asset as it was 
used by the provider at the time of sale. If the buyer and seller cannot 
agree on an allocation of the sales price, or if they do agree but there 
is insufficient documentation of the current fair market value of each 
asset, the intermediary for the selling provider will require an 
appraisal by an independent appraisal expert to establish the fair 
market value of each asset and will make an allocation of the sales 
price in accordance with the appraisal.
    (3) Sale within 1 year after termination. Gains and losses realized 
from a bona fide sale of depreciable assets within 1 year immediately 
following the date on which the provider terminates participation in the 
Medicare program are also included in the determination of allowable 
cost, in accordance with the procedure specified in paragraph (f)(2) of 
this section. However, if several assets are sold for a lump sum sales 
price, the determination of fair market value must be based on the 
appraised value of the assets as they were last used by the provider 
while participating in the Medicare program.
    (4) Exchange, trade-in or donation. Gains or losses realized from 
the exchange, trade-in, or donation of depreciable assets are not 
included in the determination of allowable cost. When the disposition of 
an asset is by means of exchange or trade-in, the historical cost of the 
new asset is the sum of the undepreciated cost of the asset disposed of 
and the additional cash or other assets transferred (or to be 
transferred) to acquire the new asset. However, if the asset disposed of 
was acquired by the provider before its participation in the Medicare 
program and the sum of the undepreciated cost and the cash or other 
assets transferred (or to be transferred) exceed the list price or fair 
market value of the new asset, the historical cost of the new asset is 
limited to the lower of its list price or fair market value.
    (5) Demolition or abandonment. (i) For purposes of this section, the 
term ``abandonment'' means the permanent retirement of an asset for any 
future purpose, not merely the provider's ceasing to use the asset for 
patient care purposes. To claim an abandonment under the Medicare 
program, the provider must have relinquished all rights, title, claim, 
and possession of the asset with the intention of never reclaiming it or 
resuming its ownership, possession, or enjoyment.
    (ii) If losses resulting from the demolition or abandonment of 
depreciable assets do not exceed $5,000 within the cost-reporting 
period, the losses are to be allowed in the period of disposal.
    (iii) If losses exceed $5,000 and, at the date of disposition, the 
demolished or abandoned assets are at least 80 percent depreciated as 
computed under the straight-line method, such losses are includable in 
the determination of allowable cost under the Medicare program in the 
period of disposal and the procedure provided in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) 
of this section must be used in determining the adjustment to 
reimbursable cost.
    (iv) Losses in excess of $5,000 resulting from the demolition or 
abandonment of assets, which at the date of disposition are not 80 
percent depreciated as computed under the straight-line method, must be 
capitalized as a

[[Page 434]]

deferred charge and amortized as follows:
    (A) If the State Health Planning and Development Agency (SHPDA) 
designated under section 1521 of the Public Health Service Act approves 
the demolition or abandonment of a depreciable asset as being consistent 
with the health systems plan of the health service area in which the 
provider is located, the net loss realized shall be capitalized as a 
deferred charge and amortized over the remaining life of the demolished 
or abandoned asset, or at the rate of $5,000 per year, whichever is 
greater. If no SHPDA exists or if such agency is unable or unwilling to 
perform this function, the provider must submit a request for approval 
to the intermediary. The intermediary, after reviewing this request and 
before issuing the approval, will submit the request along with its 
recommendation to the appropriate Regional Office for its approval.
    (B) If a provider fails to obtain approval as specified in paragraph 
(f)(5)(iv)(A) of this section, a loss is not allowable unless the 
demolished or abandoned asset is replaced. If the asset is replaced, the 
loss resulting from the unapproved demolition or abandonment must be 
capitalized as a deferred charge and amortized over the estimated useful 
life of the replacement asset or at the rate of $5,000 per year, 
whichever is greater.
    (v) If a loss resulting from the demolition or abandonment is 
deferred and amortized and the provider terminates its participation in 
the Medicare program or ceases to use a replacement asset in the 
provision of patient care services, the unamortized deferred charge 
remaining at that time must not be included in determining allowable 
cost under the Medicare program.
    (vi) Losses on demolition must include the demolition cost incurred 
by the provider for razing and removal of the asset, less any salvage 
value recovered by the provider. However, if a provider demolishes a 
depreciable asset for the purpose of preparing land for future sale, the 
net demolition cost incurred by the provider (razing and removal costs 
less salvage recovered) is considered a capital expenditure and added to 
the historical basis of the land.
    (vii) If a provider purchases land on which there is a building, no 
depreciation will be allowed under the Medicare program unless the 
building is used in providing patient care. If the building is 
demolished, the entire purchase price and demolition cost shall be 
considered the historical cost of the land. If the building is used for 
patient care, but demolished within 5 years of purchase, the entire 
purchase price, less allowed depreciation, plus demolition cost will be 
considered the historical cost of the land.
    (6) Involuntary conversion. (i) Losses resulting from the 
involuntary conversion of depreciable assets, such as condemnation, 
fire, theft, or other casualty, are generally included in the 
determination of allowable cost on a deferred basis if the asset is 
restored or replaced. However, losses resulting from a provider's 
imprudent management of its depreciable assets, such as the failure to 
obtain proper insurance coverage, are not included in the determination 
of allowable cost.
    (ii) The net allowable loss from involuntary conversion must consist 
of the undepreciated cost of unrecovered book value of the asset, less 
amounts received from insurance proceeds gifts, and grants received from 
local, State, or Federal government, or any other source as a result of 
the involuntary conversion.
    (iii) If the asset is replaced and the net allowable loss in any 
cost-reporting period does not exceed $5,000, the entire amount must be 
included in allowable cost in the period in which the loss is incurred. 
If the asset is replaced and the net allowable loss in any cost-
reporting period exceeds $5,000, the loss must be capitalized as a 
deferred charge and amortized over the useful life of the replacement or 
restored asset. If a replaced or restored asset ceases to be used in the 
provision of patient care services or the provider terminates its 
participation in the Medicare program, the unamortized deferred charge 
remaining at that time will not be included in determining allowable 
cost under the Medicare program.
    (iv) If the provider fails to replace or restore an involuntarily 
converted

[[Page 435]]

asset, the loss is not included in determining allowable cost. However, 
if the provider intends to replace or restore the asset but is unable to 
do so because the designated SHPDA finds such replacement or restoration 
to be inconsistent with the health systems plan of the provider's health 
service area, the loss is allowable so long as the provider continues to 
participate in Medicare. In this case, the loss must be capitalized as a 
deferred charge and amortized over the remaining life of the 
involuntarily converted asset, or at the rate of $5,000 per year, 
whichever is greater.
    (v) If a gain is realized from an involuntary conversion of 
depreciable assets, the net amount realized reduces the basis of the 
restored or replacement asset. If the asset is not restored or replaced, 
the gain is to be treated in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this 
section.
    (7) Effect on equity capital. The unrecovered loss entered on the 
books of the provider as a deferred charge, in accordance with 
paragraphs (f) (5) and (6) of this section, is not includable in the 
computation of equity capital under Sec. 413.157.
    (8) Sale of replacement or restored assets. If a provider sells a 
replacement or restored asset while participating in the Medicare 
program or within 1 year immediately following the date on which it 
terminates its participation in the Medicare program, the unrecovered 
loss entered on the books of the provider as a deferred charge in 
accordance with paragraphs (f) (5) and (6) of this section will not be 
included in determining the gain or loss realized from the sale of the 
replacement or restored asset. However, if the sale of such asset is 
made to a related organization, as defined in Sec. 413.17, and the 
purchasing organization continues as a provider in the Medicare program, 
the remaining deferred charge representing the unrecovered depreciable 
basis of the demolished, abandoned or destroyed asset must continue to 
be amortized over the remaining expected useful life of the replacement 
or restored asset. If the sale is made to an unrelated organization, 
further amortization of the deferred charge is not allowed.
    (g) Establishment of cost basis on purchase of facility as an 
ongoing operation--(1) Assets acquired after July 1, 1966 and before 
August 1, 1970. The cost basis for the assets of a facility purchased as 
an ongoing operation after July 1, 1966, and before August 1, 1970, is 
the lowest of the--
    (i) Total price paid for the facility by the purchaser, as allocated 
to the individual assets of the facility;
    (ii) Total fair market value of the facility at the time of the 
sale, as allocated to the individual assets; or
    (iii) Combined fair market value of the individually identified 
assets at the time of the sale.
    (2) Assets acquired after July 31, 1970 and, for hospitals and SNFs, 
before July 18, 1984. For depreciable assets acquired after July 31, 
1970 and, for hospitals and SNFs, before July 18, 1984, in addition to 
the limitations specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the cost 
basis of the depreciable assets may not exceed the current reproduction 
cost depreciated on a straight-line basis over the life of the asset to 
the time of the sale.
    (3) Assets acquired by hospitals and SNFs on or after July 18, 1984 
and not subject to an enforceable agreement entered into before that 
date. Subject to paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) (B) through (G) and (b)(1)(iii) 
of this section, historical cost may not exceed the lowest of the 
following:
    (i) The allowable acquisition cost of the asset to the owner of 
record as of July 18, 1984 (or, in the case of an asset not in existence 
as of July 18, 1984, the first owner of record of the asset);
    (ii) The acquisition cost to the new owner; or
    (iii) The fair market value of the asset on the date of acquisition.
    (4) Transactions other than bona fide. If the purchaser cannot 
demonstrate that the sale was bona fide, in addition to the limitations 
specified in paragraph (g)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, the 
purchaser's cost basis may not exceed the seller's cost basis, less 
accumulated depreciation.
    (h) Sale and leaseback agreements and other lease transactions. (1) 
For sale and leaseback agreements for all providers, and for sale and 
leaseback agreements

[[Page 436]]

for hospitals and SNFs entered into before October 23, 1992, a provider 
may include in its allowable costs incurred rental charges, as specified 
in a sale and leaseback agreement with a nonrelated purchaser involving 
plant facilities or equipment, only if--
    (i) The rental charges are reasonable based on consideration of 
rental charges of comparable facilities and market conditions in the 
area; the type, expected life, condition, and value of the facilities or 
equipment rented; and other provisions of the rental agreement;
    (ii) Adequate alternate facilities or equipment that would serve the 
purpose are not or were not available at lower cost; and
    (iii) The leasing was based on economic and technical 
considerations.
    (2) If the conditions of paragraph (h)(1) of this section are not 
met, the amount a provider may include in its allowable costs as rental 
or lease expense under a sale and leaseback agreement may not exceed the 
amount that the provider would have included in its allowable costs had 
the provider retained legal title to the facilities or equipment such as 
interest expense on mortgages, taxes, depreciation, and insurance costs.
    (3) For hospitals and SNFs entering into sale and leaseback 
agreements on or after October 23, 1992, the amount a provider may 
include in its allowable costs as rental or lease expense may not exceed 
the amount that the provider would have included in its allowable costs 
had the provider retained legal title to the facilities or equipment, 
such as interest expense on mortgages, taxes, depreciation, and 
insurance costs (the costs of ownership). This limitation applies both 
on an annual basis and over the useful life of the asset.
    (i) If in the early years of the lease, the annual rental or lease 
costs are less than the annual costs of ownership, but in the later 
years of the lease the annual rental or lease costs are more than the 
annual costs of ownership, in the years that the annual rental or lease 
costs are more than the costs of ownership the provider may include in 
allowable costs annually the actual amount of rental or lease costs. The 
aggregate rental or lease costs included in allowable costs may not 
exceed the aggregate costs of ownership that would have been included in 
allowable costs over the useful life of the asset had the provider 
retained legal title to the asset.
    (ii) If in the early years of the lease, the annual rental or lease 
costs exceed the annual costs of ownership, but in the later years of 
the lease the annual rental or lease costs are less than the annual 
costs of ownership, the provider may carry forward amounts of rental or 
lease costs that were not included in allowable costs in the early years 
of the lease due to the costs of ownership limitation, and include these 
amounts in allowable costs in the years of the lease when the annual 
rental or lease costs are less than the annual costs of ownership. In 
any given year the amount of actual annual rental or lease costs plus 
the amount carried forward to that year may not exceed the amount of the 
costs of ownership for that year.
    (iii) In the aggregate, the amount of rental or lease costs included 
in allowable costs may not exceed the amount of the costs of ownership 
that the provider could have included in allowable costs had the 
provider retained legal title to the asset.
    (4) For lease transactions of all providers entered into before 
October 23, 1992, a lease that meets the following conditions 
establishes a virtual purchase:
    (i) The rental charge exceeds rental charges of comparable 
facilities or equipment in the area.
    (ii) The term of the lease is less than the useful life of the 
facilities or equipment.
    (iii) The provider has the option to renew the lease at a 
significantly reduced rental, or the provider has the right to purchase 
the facilities or equipment at a price that appears to be significantly 
less than what the fair market value of the facilities or equipment 
would be at the time acquisition by the provider is permitted.
    (5)(i) If a lease is a virtual purchase under paragraph (h)(4) of 
this section, the rental charge is includable in allowable costs only to 
the extent that it does not exceed the amount that the

[[Page 437]]

provider would have included in allowable costs if it had legal title to 
the asset (the cost of ownership), such as straight-line depreciation, 
insurance, and interest. For purposes of computing the limitation on 
allowable rental cost in this paragraph, a provider may not include 
accelerated depreciation.
    (ii) The difference between the amount of rent paid and the amount 
of rent allowed as rental expense is considered a deferred charge and 
must be capitalized as part of the historical cost of the asset when the 
asset is purchased.
    (iii) If an asset is returned to the owner instead of being 
purchased, the deferred charge may be expensed in the year the asset is 
returned.
    (iv) If the term of the lease is extended for an additional period 
of time at a reduced lease cost and the option to purchase still exists, 
the deferred charge may be expensed to the extent of increasing the 
reduced rental to an amount not in excess of the cost of ownership.
    (v) If the term of the lease is extended for an additional period of 
time at a reduced lease cost and the option to purchase no longer 
exists, the deferred charge may be expensed to the extent of increasing 
the reduced rental to a fair rental value.
    (6) For lease transactions entered into on or after October 23, 
1992, a lease that meets any one of the following conditions establishes 
a virtual purchase:
    (i) The lease transfers title of the facilities or equipment to the 
lessee during the lease term.
    (ii) The lease contains a bargain purchase option.
    (iii) The lease term is 75 percent or more of the useful life of the 
facilities or equipment. This provision is not applicable if the lease 
begins in the last 25 percent of the useful life of the facilities or 
equipment.
    (iv) The present value of the minimum lease payments (that is, 
payments to be made during the lease term, including bargain purchase 
option, guaranteed residual value, or penalties for failure to renew) 
equals 90 percent or more of the fair market value of the leased 
property. This provision is not applicable if the lease begins in the 
last 25 percent of the useful life of the facilities or equipment. The 
present value is computed using the lessee's incremental borrowing rate, 
unless the interest rate implicit in the lease is known and is less than 
the lessee's incremental borrowing rate, in which case, the interest 
rate implicit in the lease is used.
    (7)(i) If a lease is a virtual purchase under paragraph (h)(6) of 
this section, the rental charge is includable in allowable costs only to 
the extent that it does not exceed the amount that the provider would 
have included in allowable costs if it had legal title to the asset (the 
costs of ownership), such as straight-line depreciation, insurance, and 
interest. For purposes of computing the limitation on allowable rental 
cost as described in this paragraph, a provider may not include 
accelerated depreciation in its allowable costs.
    (ii) The difference between the amount of rent paid and the amount 
of rent allowed as rental expense is considered a deferred charge and is 
capitalized as part of the historical cost of the asset when the asset 
is purchased.
    (iii) If an asset is returned to the owner instead of being 
purchased, the deferred charge may be expensed in the year the asset is 
returned.
    (iv) If the term of the lease is extended for an additional period 
of time at a reduced lease cost and the option to purchase still exists, 
the deferred charge may be expensed to the extent of increasing the 
reduced rental to an amount not in excess of the cost of ownership.
    (v) If the term of the lease is extended for an additional period of 
time at a reduced lease cost and the option to purchase no longer 
exists, the deferred charge may be expensed to the extent of increasing 
the reduced rental to a fair rental value.
    (vi) If the lessee becomes the owner of the leased asset (either by 
operation of the lease or by other means), the amount considered as 
depreciation, for the purpose of having computed the limitation 
expressed in paragraph (h)(7)(i) of this section, must be used in 
calculating the limitation on adjustments to depreciation for the 
purpose of determining any gain or loss upon

[[Page 438]]

disposal of an asset under paragraph (f) of this section.
    (i) Intergovernmental transfer of facilities. The basis for 
depreciation of assets transferred under appropriate legal authority 
from one governmental entity to another is as follows:
    (1) The historical cost incurred by the present owner in acquiring 
the asset under a bona fide sale. The historical cost may not exceed the 
lower of current reproduction cost adjusted for straight-line 
depreciation over the life of the asset to the time of the purchase of 
fair market value at the time of the purchase.
    (2) The fair market value at the time of donation under a bona fide 
donation of the asset (subject to the limitations set forth under 
paragraph (i) of this section). An asset is considered donated when a 
governmental entity acquires the asset without assuming the functions 
for which the transferor used the asset or making any payment for it in 
the form of cash, property, or services.
    (3) If neither paragraph (h) (1) nor (2) of this section applies, 
for example, the transfer was solely to facilitate administration or to 
reallocate jurisdictional responsibility, or the transfer constituted a 
taking over in whole or in part of the function of one governmental 
entity by another governmental entity, the basis for depreciation is--
    (i) With respect to an asset on which the transferor has claimed 
depreciation under the Medicare program, the transferor's basis under 
the Medicare program prior to the transfer. The method of depreciation 
used by the transferee may be the same as that used by the transferor, 
or the transferee may change the method, as permitted under paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section; or
    (ii) With respect to an asset on which the transferor has not 
claimed depreciation under the Medicare program, the cost incurred by 
the transferor in acquiring the asset (not to exceed the basis that 
would have been recognized had the transferor participated in the 
Medicare program) less depreciation calculated on the straight-line 
basis over the life of the asset to the time of transfer.
    (j) Basis of assets donated to a provider--(1) Assets not used or 
depreciated under the Medicare program. If an asset has never been used 
or depreciated under the Medicare program and is donated to a provider, 
the basis for the purpose of calculating depreciation and equity capital 
(if applicable) is the fair market value of the asset at the time of 
donation.
    (2) Assets used or depreciated under the Medicare program. If an 
asset has been used or depreciated under the Medicare program and is 
donated to a provider, the basis for the purpose of calculating 
depreciation and equity capital (if applicable) is the lesser of--
    (i) The fair market value at the time of donation; or
    (ii) The net book value in the hands of the owner last participating 
in the Medicare program.
    (3) Transfers of State hospitals to nonprofit corporations without 
monetary consideration. If a State transfers a hospital to a nonprofit 
corporation without monetary consideration on or after July 18, 1984, 
the depreciable basis of the assets to the new owner is the net book 
value of the assets as recorded on the State's books at the time of the 
transfer. For purposes of this section, monetary consideration includes 
cash, new debt, and assumed debt.
    (k) Limitation on Federal participation for capital expenditures. 
The allowance for depreciation is not an allowable cost for certain 
capital expenditures as described in Sec. 413.161.
    (l) Transactions involving a provider's capital stock--(1) 
Acquisition of capital stock of a provider. If the capital stock of a 
provider is acquired, the provider's assets may not be revalued. For 
example, if Corporation A purchases the capital stock of Corporation B, 
the provider, Corporation B continues to be the provider after the 
purchase and Corporation A is merely the stockholder. Corporation B's 
assets may not be revalued.
    (2) Statutory merger. A statutory merger is a combination of two or 
more corporations under the corporation laws of the State, with one of 
the corporations surviving. The surviving corporation acquires the 
assets and liabilities of the merged corporation(s) by operation of 
State law. The effect of a

[[Page 439]]

statutory merger upon Medicare reimbursement is as follows:
    (i) Statutory merger between unrelated parties. If the statutory 
merger is between two or more corporations that are unrelated (as 
specified in Sec. 413.17), the assets of the merged corporation(s) 
acquired by the surviving corporation may be revalued in accordance with 
paragraph (g) of this section. If the merged corporation was a provider 
before the merger, then it is subject to the provisions of paragraphs 
(d)(3) and (f) of this section concerning recovery of accelerated 
depreciation and the realization of gains and losses. The basis of the 
assets owned by the surviving corporation are unaffected by the 
transaction. An example of this type of transaction is one in which 
Corporation A, a nonprovider, and Corporation B, the provider, are 
combined by a statutory merger, with Corporation A being the surviving 
corporation. In such a case the assets of Corporation B acquired by 
Corporation A may be revalued in accordance with paragraph (g) of this 
section.
    (ii) Statutory merger between related parties. If the statutory 
merger is between two or more related corporations (as specified in 
Sec. 413.17), no revaluation of assets is permitted for those assets 
acquired by the surviving corporation. An example of this type of 
transaction is one in which Corporation A purchase the capital stock of 
Corporation B, the provider. Immediately after the acquisition of the 
capital stock of Corporation B, there is a statutory merger of 
Corporation B and Corporation A, with Corporation A being the surviving 
corporation. Under these circumstances, at the time of the merger the 
transaction is one between related parties and is not a basis for 
revaluation of the provider's assets.
    (3) Consolidation. A consolidation is the combination of two or more 
corporations resulting in the creation of a new corporate entity. If at 
least one of the original corporations is a provider, the effect of a 
consolidation upon Medicare reimbursement for the provider is as 
follows:
    (i) Consolidation between unrelated parties. If the consolidation is 
between two or more corporations that are unrelated (as specified in 
Sec. 413.17), the assets of the provider corporation(s) may be revalued 
in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (ii) Consolidation between related parties. If the consolidation is 
between two or more related corporations (as specified in Sec. 413.17), 
no revaluation of provider assets is permitted.

<R05>
Sec. 413.139  Depreciation: Optional allowance for depreciation based on a percentage of operating costs.

    (a) Principle. With respect to all assets acquired before 1966, the 
provider, at its option, may choose an allowance for depreciation based 
on a percentage of operating costs. The operating costs to be used are 
the provider's 1965 operating costs or the provider's current year's 
allowable costs, whichever are the lower. The percentage to be applied 
is 5 percent starting with the year 1966-67, with such percentage being 
uniformly reduced by one-half percent each succeeding year. The 
allowance based on operating costs is in addition to regular 
depreciation on assets acquired after 1965; however, if the optional 
allowance is selected, the combined amount of such allowance on pre-1966 
assets and the straight-line depreciation on assets acquired after 1965 
(including the estimated depreciation on assets held on a rental basis 
during the current year) may not exceed 6 percent of the provider's 
allowable cost for the current year.
    (b) Definitions--(1) Operating costs. Operating costs are the total 
costs incurred by the provider in operating the institution or facility.
    (2) Allowable costs. Allowable costs are the costs of a provider 
that are includable under the principles for cost reimbursement. Through 
application of apportionment methods to the total amount of such 
allowable costs, the share of a provider's total cost that is 
attributable to covered services for beneficiaries is determined.
    (c) Application. If a provider has inadequate historical cost 
records for pre-1966 depreciable assets, the provider may elect to 
receive an allowance for

[[Page 440]]

depreciation on such assets based on a percentage of operating costs. 
The optional allowance for depreciation for such assets may be used, 
however, whether or not a provider has records of the cost of pre-1966 
depreciable assets currently in use.
    (d) Allowance based on a percentage of operating costs. (1) The 
allowance for depreciation based on a percentage of operating costs is 
to be computed by applying a specified percentage to a base amount equal 
to the provider's 1965 total operating costs, without adjustments to 
these principles or the current year's allowable operating costs, 
whichever is lower. The percentage to be applied is five for the 
reporting period that starts before or during 1966-67, four and one-half 
for the reporting period that begins during 1967-68, and continues to 
decline annually by equal amounts to become zero in 1976-77.
    (2) If used as a base for determining the optional allowance for 
depreciation, neither the 1965 operating costs nor the current year's 
allowable costs are to include any actual depreciation, estimated 
depreciation on rented depreciable-type assets, allowance in lieu of 
specific recognition of other costs, or return on equity capital. Such 
exclusions are to be made only for the purpose of computing the 
allowance for depreciation based on operating costs. For other purposes, 
the excluded amounts are recognized in determining allowable costs and 
for computing the costs of services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries 
during the reporting period.
    (e) Change to actual depreciation. (1) A provider that elects this 
allowance may at any time before 1976 change to actual depreciation on 
all pre-1966 depreciable assets. In such case, this option is eliminated 
and the provider can no longer elect to receive an allowance for 
depreciation based on a percentage of operating costs.
    (2) If the provider desires to change to actual depreciation but 
either has no historical cost records or has incomplete records, the 
determination of historical cost may be made through appropriate means 
involving expert consultation with the determination being subject to 
review and approval by the intermediary.
    (f) Determination of optional allowance based on percentage of 
operating costs illustrated. The following illustrates how the provider 
would determine the optional allowance for depreciation based on 
operating costs.

    Example No. 1. The provider keeps its records on a calendar year 
basis. The current year's actual allowable cost and the actual operating 
cost for 1965 do not include any actual depreciation or rentals on 
depreciable-type assets. The current year's allowable cost also does not 
include any allowance in lieu of specific recognition of other costs or 
return on equity capital.

    Example No. 2. When the provider pays rent for depreciable-type 
assets rented prior to 1966, the estimated depreciation on such assets 
must be deducted from the allowance. The following illustration 
demonstrates how the allowance is determined.
    The provider keeps its records on a calendar year basis. The current 
year's actual allowable cost and the actual operating cost for 1965 did 
not include any actual depreciation, allowance in lieu of specific 
recognition

[[Page 441]]

of other costs, or return on equity capital. However, such costs have 
been adjusted to exclude estimated depreciation on rented depreciable-
type assets.

\1\ 1965 operating cost was used in computing the allowance for         
  depreciation based on a percentage of operating costs because it was  
  lower than 1966 allowable cost.                                       


    (g) Limitation on depreciation if optional allowance is used. This 
optional allowance only is subject to a limitation based on the 
provider's total allowable operating cost for the current year. To 
determine this limitation, compute the sum of the actual depreciation 
claimed, the allowance based on a percentage of operating costs, and the 
estimated straight-line depreciation on depreciable-type assets rented 
after 1965. If this sum exceeds six percent of the provider's current 
year's allowable cost (exclusive of any actual depreciation claimed, 
estimated depreciation on rented depreciable-type assets, allowance in 
lieu of specific recognition of other costs, and return on equity 
capital), the allowance for depreciation based on a percentage of 
operating costs is reduced by the amount of excess. In applying this 
limitation, if the actual depreciation claimed is on an accelerated 
basis, it must be converted to a straight-line basis only for use in 
calculating this limitation. It is presumed that pre-1966 assets will 
not be retired at a greater than normal rate, and the limitation of six 
percent, as it affects the availability of the allowance, is designed as 
a safeguard if the presumption is not borne out. If the provider does 
not elect to use the optional allowance, the combined allowance for 
depreciation based on costs of pre-1966 assets and those subsequently 
acquired is not subject to the six percent limitation.

    Example No. 1. The following illustration demonstrates how this 
limitation would be determined.

    Assume in this illustration that the provider had elected to use the 
declining balance method in computing its allowable depreciation and the 
rental expense for depreciable-type assets was $3,500. In that case, it 
would include in its 1966 allowable cost not only the $46,000 allowance 
based on operating costs but also $36,000 (in this instance 
2 x straight-line rate is used) in actual depreciation and the rental 
expense of $3,500--or a total of $85,500 covering all its depreciable 
assets.

Sec. 413.144  Depreciation: Allowance for depreciation on fully depreciated or partially depreciated assets.

    (a) Principle. Depreciation on assets being used by a provider at 
the time it enters into the Medicare program is allowed. This principle 
applies even though such assets may be fully or partially depreciated on 
the provider's books.
    (b) Application. Depreciation is allowable on assets being used at 
the time the provider enters into the program. This applies even though 
such assets

[[Page 442]]

may be fully depreciated on the provider's books or fully depreciated 
with respect to other third-party payers. So long as an asset is being 
used, its useful life is considered not to have ended, and consequently 
the asset is subject to depreciation based upon a revised estimate of 
the asset's useful life as determined by the provider and approved by 
the intermediary. Correction of prior years' depreciation to reflect 
revision of estimated useful life should be made in the first year of 
participation in the program unless the provider has used the optional 
method (Sec. 413.139), in which case the correction should be made at 
the time of discontinuing the use of that method. If an asset has become 
fully depreciated under Medicare, further depreciation is not 
appropriate or allowable, even though the asset may continue in use.
    (c) Example of an allowance for a fully-depreciated asset. For 
example, if a 50-year-old building is in use at the time the provider 
enters into the program, depreciation is allowable on the building even 
though it has been fully depreciated on the provider's books. Assuming 
that a reasonable estimate of the asset's continued life is 20 years (70 
years from the date of acquisition), the provider may claim depreciation 
over the next 20 years--if the asset is in use that long--or a total 
depreciation of as much as twenty-seventieths of the asset's historical 
cost.
    (d) Corrections to depreciation. If the asset is disposed of before 
the expiration of its estimated useful life, the depreciation would be 
adjusted to the actual useful life. Likewise, a provider may not have 
fully depreciated other assets it is using and finds that it has 
incorrectly estimated the useful lives of those assets. In such cases, 
the provider may use the corrected useful lives in determining the 
amount of depreciation, provided such corrections have been approved by 
the intermediary.


<R05>
Sec. 413.149  Depreciation: Allowance for depreciation on assets financed with Federal or public funds.

    (a) Principle. Depreciation is allowed on assets financed with Hill-
Burton or other Federal or public funds.
    (b) Application. Like other assets (including other donated 
depreciable assets), assets financed with Hill-Burton or other Federal 
or public funds become a part of the provider institution's plant and 
equipment to be used in furnishing services. It is the function of 
payment of depreciation to provide funds that make it possible to 
maintain the assets and preserve the capital employed in the production 
of services. Therefore, irrespective of the source of financing of an 
asset, if it is used in the providing of services for beneficiaries of 
the program, payment for depreciation of the asset is, in fact, a cost 
of the production of those services. Moreover, recognition of this cost 
is necessary to maintain productive capacity for the future. An 
incentive for funding of depreciation is provided in these principles by 
the provision that investment income on funded depreciation is not 
treated as a reduction of allowable interest expense under 
Sec. 413.153(a).


<R05>
Sec. 413.153  Interest expense.

    (a)(1) Principle. Necessary and proper interest on both current and 
capital indebtedness is an allowable cost. However, interest costs are 
not allowable if incurred as a result of--
    (i) Judicial review by a Federal court (as described in 
Sec. 413.64(j));
    (ii) An interest assessment on a determined overpayment (as 
described in Sec. 405.377 of this chapter); or
    (iii) Interest on funds borrowed to repay an overpayment (as 
described in Sec. 413.64(j) or Sec. 405.378 of this chapter), up to the 
amount of the overpayment, unless the provider had made a prior 
commitment to borrow funds for other purposes (for example, capital 
improvements).
    (2) Exception. In those cases of administrative or judicial 
reversal, interest paid on funds borrowed to repay an overpayment is an 
allowable cost, in accordance with this section.
    (b) Definitions--(1) Interest. Interest is the cost incurred for the 
use of borrowed funds. Interest on current indebtedness is the cost 
incurred for funds borrowed for a relatively short term. This is usually 
for such purposes

[[Page 443]]

as working capital for normal operating expenses. Interest on capital 
indebtedness is the cost incurred for funds borrowed for capital 
purposes, such as acquisition of facilities and equipment, and capital 
improvements. Generally, loans for capital purposes are long-term loans.
    (2) Necessary. Necessary interest is interest that meets the 
following requirements:
    (i) It is incurred on a loan made to satisfy a financial need of the 
provider. Loans that result in excess funds or investments are not 
considered necessary.
    (ii) It is incurred on a loan made for a purpose reasonably related 
to patient care.
    (iii) It is reduced by investment income except income from--
    (A) Gifts, grants, and endowments, whether held separately or pooled 
with other funds;
    (B) Funded depreciation that meets the program's qualifying 
criteria;
    (C) The provider's qualified pension funds;
    (D) The provider's deferred compensation funds that meet the 
program's qualifying criteria; and
    (E) The provider's self-insurance trust funds that meet the 
program's qualifying criteria.
    (iv) It is not reduced by interest received as a result of judicial 
review by a Federal court (as described in Sec. 413.64(j)).
    (3) Proper. Proper requires that interest be--
    (i) Incurred at a rate not in excess of what a prudent borrower 
would have had to pay in the money market existing at the time the loan 
was made; and
    (ii) Paid to a lender not related through control or ownership, or 
personal relationship to the borrowing organization. However, interest 
is allowable if paid on loans from the provider's donor-restricted 
funds, the funded depreciation account, or the provider's qualified 
pension fund.
    (4) Zero coupon bonds. Zero coupon bonds are issued by government 
agencies, corporations, and banks at a price substantially below the 
face value. The difference between the purchase price and the face value 
reflects the actual amount of interest and is neither a discount nor an 
adjustment to the interest rate as with other bonds. Interest is paid at 
maturity when the bond is redeemed at face value.
    (c) Borrower-lender relationship. (1) Except as described in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, to be allowable, interest expense must 
be incurred on indebtedness established with lenders or lending 
organizations not related through control, ownership, or personal 
relationship to the borrower. Presence of any of these factors could 
affect the ``bargaining'' process that usually accompanies the making of 
a loan, and could thus be suggestive of an agreement on higher rates of 
interest or of unnecessary loans. Loans should be made under terms and 
conditions that a prudent borrower would make in armslength transactions 
with lending institutions. The intent of this provision is to assure 
that loans are legitimate and needed, and that the interest rate is 
reasonable. Thus, interest paid by the provider to partners, 
stockholders, or related organizations of the provider would not be 
allowable. If the owner uses his own funds in a business, it is 
reasonable to treat the funds as invested funds or capital, rather than 
borrowed funds. Therefore, if interest on loans by partners, 
stockholders, or related organizations is disallowed as a cost solely 
because of the relationship factor, the principal of such loans is 
treated as invested funds in the computation of the provider's equity 
capital under Sec. 413.157.
    (2) Exceptions to the general rule regarding interest on loans from 
controlled sources of funds are made in the following circumstances. 
Interest on loans to providers by partners, stockholders, or related 
organizations made prior to July 1, 1966, is allowable as cost, provided 
that the terms and conditions of payment of such loans have been 
maintained in effect without modification subsequent to July 1, 1966. If 
the general fund of a provider ``borrows'' from a donor-restricted fund 
and pays interest to the restricted fund, this interest expense is an 
allowable cost. The same treatment is accorded interest paid by the 
general fund on money ``borrowed'' from the funded depreciation account 
of the provider or from the provider's qualified pension

[[Page 444]]

fund. In addition, if a provider operated by members of a religious 
order borrows from the order, interest paid to the order is an allowable 
cost.
    (3) If funded depreciation is used for purposes other than 
improvement, replacement, or expansion of facilities or equipment 
related to patient care, allowable interest expense is reduced to adjust 
for offsets not made in prior years for earnings on funded depreciation. 
A similar treatment is accorded deposits in the provider's qualified 
pension fund if such deposits are used for other than the purpose for 
which the fund was established.
    (d) Loans not reasonably related to patient care. (1) The following 
types of loans are not considered to be for a purpose reasonably related 
to patient care:
    (i) For loans made to finance acquisition of a facility, that 
portion of the cost that exceeds--
    (A) Historical cost as determined under Sec. 413.134(b); or
    (B) The cost basis determined under Sec. 413.134(g); and
    (ii) Loans made to finance capital stock acquisitions, mergers, or 
consolidations for which revaluation of assets is not allowed under 
Sec. 413.134(k).
    (2) In determining whether a loan was made for the purpose of 
acquiring a facility, we apply any owner's investment or funds first to 
the tangible assets, then to the intangible assets other than goodwill, 
and lastly to the goodwill. If the owner's investment or funds are not 
sufficient to cover the cost allowed for tangible assets, we apply funds 
borrowed to finance the acquisition to the portion of the allowed cost 
of the tangible assets not covered by the owner's investment, then to 
the intangible assets other than goodwill, and lastly to the goodwill. 
Repayments of the funds borrowed are applied first to the borrowing 
related to the tangible assets, then to the borrowing related to the 
intangible assets other than goodwill, and lastly to the borrowing 
related to the goodwill.
    (3) When a provider borrows funds, but only some of the funds are 
necessary, repayments of the loan (principal and interest portions) are 
applied first to pay for the necessary portion of the loan. Only after 
all of the necessary portion of the loan (principal and interest) has 
been repaid are any repayments applied to the unnecessary portion of the 
loan. Repayments toward non-allowable borrowing pertaining to assets or 
activities not related to patient care are considered investments, and 
the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section are applied.
    (e) Limitation on Federal participation for capital expenditures. 
The allowance for depreciation is not an allowable cost for certain 
capital expenditures as described in Sec. 413.161.
    (f) Zero coupon bonds--(1) Interest on bonds issued on or after 
August 15, 1996. For zero coupon bonds issued on or after August 15, 
1996, interest expense incurred to provide funds for patient care-
related costs is an allowable expense, and interest income earned for 
investment purposes is an allowable offset, in the cost reporting period 
in which the interest accrues.
    (2) Interest income offset. Interest income from zero coupon bonds 
must be offset against allowable interest expense as prescribed in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section and in Sec. 413.130(g)(2). If zero 
coupon bonds are purchased with the proceeds of an advanced refunding of 
debt, offset of the investment income is required under 
Sec. 413.153(b)(2)(iii), but the investment income is not prorated under 
Sec. 413.130(g)(2).
    (3) Use of effective interest method. (i) Interest expense and 
interest income from zero coupon bonds that are reported as they accrue 
must be amortized using the effective interest method. This method 
recognizes the actual accrual of interest expense or income for each 
interest computation period (as specified by the bond instrument) 
throughout the life of the bond.
    (ii) A constant effective yield rate is determined and applied to 
the book value (outstanding loan balance including prior accrued 
interest) of the bond at the beginning of each period to determine the 
total interest for the period.
    (iii) If the interest computation period involves portions of more 
than one cost reporting period, the amount of interest for that 
computation period shall be apportioned to each cost reporting period.

[[Page 445]]

    (iv) An example of the computation of interest using the effective 
interest method follows:

                                  Facts

    Life of zero coupon bond: 15 years.
    Value at maturity: $50,000.
    Bondholder pays $6,996 for the bond.
    Annual interest rate is 13.5506% compounded semi-annually.
    From the table below, interest for the first year would be $980.11 
($474.00 plus $506.11).

Sec. 413.157  Return on equity capital of proprietary providers.

    (a) Definitions. For purposes of this section--
    Proprietary provider means a provider that is organized and operated 
with the expectation of earning a profit for its owners (as 
distinguished from a provider that is organized and operated on a 
nonprofit basis). Proprietary providers may be sole proprietorships, 
partnerships, or corporations. Effective for cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after July 6, 1987, the term applies only to proprietary 
hospitals and SNFs.
    (b) General rule. A reasonable return on equity capital invested and 
used in the provision of patient care is paid as an allowance in 
addition to the reasonable cost of covered services furnished to 
beneficiaries by proprietary providers.
    (1) Rate of return applicable to proprietary providers for cost 
reporting periods beginning before July 6, 1987. Except as provided in 
paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of this section, the amount 
allowable on an annual basis, for cost reporting periods beginning 
before July 6, 1987, is determined by multiplying the provider's equity 
capital by a percentage equal to one and one-half times the average of 
the rates of interest on special issues of public debt obligations 
issued for purchase by the Medicare Part A Trust Fund for each of the 
months during the provider's reporting period or portion thereof covered 
under the program.
    (2) Rate of return for inpatient hospital services furnished by 
proprietary hospitals. The rate used in determining the return for 
inpatient hospital services is a percentage of the average of the rates 
of interest described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The 
percentages applicable to inpatient hospital services are as follows:
    (i) 150 percent for cost reporting periods beginning before April 
20, 1983.
    (ii) 100 percent for cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
April 20, 1983 and before October 1, 1986.
    (iii) 75 percent for cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 1986 and before October 1, 1987.
    (iv) 50 percent for cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 1987 and before October 1, 1988.
    (v) 25 percent for cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 1988 and before October 1, 1989.
    (vi) Zero percent for cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 1989.
    (3) Rate of return related to proprietary SNFs. (i) For cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1985, the rate used 
in determining the return for SNF services furnished before October 1, 
1993, is a percentage equal to the average of the rates of interest 
described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (ii) There is no allowance for return for SNF services furnished on 
or after October 1, 1993.
    (4) Rate of return related to outpatient hospital services. (i) For 
cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1985, the rate 
used in determining the return for outpatient hospital services 
furnished before January 1, 1988 is a percentage equal to the average of 
the rates of interest described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (ii) There is no allowance for return for outpatient hospital 
services furnished on or after January 1, 1988.

[[Page 446]]

    (5) Rate of return for proprietary services of all nonhospital and 
non-SNF providers. (i) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 1985, but before July 6, 1987, the rate used in determining 
the return for services of all nonhospital and non-SNF providers is a 
percentage equal to the average of the rates of interest described in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (ii) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 6, 1987, 
there is no allowance for return on equity capital for nonhospital and 
non-SNF providers.
    (c) Application--(1) Computation of equity capital. For purposes of 
computing the allowable return, the provider's equity capital means--
    (i) The provider's investment in plant, property, and equipment 
related to patient care (net of depreciation) and funds deposited by a 
provider who leases plant, property, or equipment related to patient 
care and is required by the terms of the lease to deposit such funds 
(net of noncurrent debt related to such investment or deposited funds); 
and
    (ii) Net working capital maintained for necessary and proper 
operation of patient care activities. However, debt representing loans 
from partners, stockholders, or related organizations on which interest 
payments would be allowable as costs but for the provisions of 
Sec. 413.153(b)(3)(ii), is not subtracted in computing the amount of 
equity capital in order that the proceeds from such loans be treated as 
part of the provider's equity capital. In computing the amount of equity 
capital upon which a return is allowable, investment in facilities is 
recognized on the basis of the historical cost, or other basis, used for 
depreciation and other purposes under Part A of Medicare.
    (2) Acquisitions after July 1970. With respect to a facility or any 
tangible assets of a facility acquired on or after August 1, 1970, the 
excess of the price paid for such facility or such tangible assets over 
the historical cost, as defined in Sec. 413.134(b), or the cost basis, 
as determined under Sec. 413.134(g) (whichever is appropriate), is not 
includable in equity capital, and loans made to finance such excess 
portion of the cost of such acquisitions (see Sec. 413.153(d)) are 
excluded in computing equity capital.
    (3) Acquisitions prior to August 1970. With respect to a facility or 
any tangible assets of a facility acquired before August 1970, the 
excess of the price paid for such facility or assets over the fair 
market value of tangible assets at the time of purchase is includable in 
equity capital to the extent that it is reasonable except that the 
cumulative allowable return for such excess may not exceed 100 percent 
of such excess. For purposes of this section, the cumulative allowable 
return means the sum of the allowable rate of return on equity capital 
for all months starting from August 1, 1970. For example, if the 
allowable rates of return on equity capital for a provider are 9 percent 
for the first year (and such year started August 1, 1970), 8.5 percent 
for the second year, and 10.5 percent for the third year, the cumulative 
allowable return at the end of the third year would be 28 percent. After 
the cumulative allowable return equals 100 percent, the inclusion in 
equity capital of the excess is no longer allowable.
    (4) Computation of return on equity capital. For purposes of 
computing the allowable return, the amount of equity capital is the 
average investment during the reporting period. The rate of return 
allowed, as derived from time to time based upon interest rates in 
accordance with this principle, is determined by HCFA and communicated 
through intermediaries. Return on investment as an element of allowable 
costs is subject to apportionment in the same manner as other elements 
of allowable costs.

    Example of calculation of cumulative allowable return. X purchased a 
provider on July 1, 1969, paying $100,000 in excess of the fair market 
value of the assets acquired. Provider X files its cost report on a 
calendar-year basis. The allowable rate of return on equity capital for 
August 1, 1970-December 31, 1970 (4.538 percent), is obtained by 
multiplying the allowable rate of return for the period ending December 
31, 1970 (10.891) by \5/12\ (a fraction of which the numerator is the 
number of months from August 1, 1970, to the end of the cost-reporting 
period and the denominator is the number of months in the cost-reporting 
period). The cumulative allowable return for Provider X for the period 
August 1, 1970-December 31, 1973, (32.367 percent) is computed as 
follows:

                                                               (percent)

      Total..................................................     32.367
------------------------------------------------------------------------

(The $100,000 paid in excess of the fair market value of the assets 
acquired is included in equity capital until the sum of the allowable 
rate of return on equity capital equals 100 percent. Of course, no 
portion of the $100,000 may be amortized as an allowable cost or is 
otherwise allowable for any program reimbursement purposes other than 
for determining the provider's equity capital.

Subpart H--Payment for End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Services and Organ 
                            Procurement Costs

    Source: 62 FR 43668, Aug. 15, 1997, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 413.170  Scope.

    This subpart implements sections 1881 (b)(2) and (b)(7) of the Act 
by--
    (a) Setting forth the principles and authorities under which HCFA is 
authorized to establish a prospective payment system for outpatient 
maintenance dialysis furnished in or under the supervision of an ESRD 
facility approved under subpart U of part 405 of this chapter (referred 
to as ``facility'' in this section). For purposes of this section and 
Sec. 413.172 through Sec. 413.198, ``outpatient maintenance dialysis'' 
means outpatient dialysis, home dialysis, self-dialysis, and home 
dialysis training, as defined in Sec. 405.2102 (f)(2)(ii), (f)(2)(iii), 
and (f)(3) of this chapter, and includes all items and services 
specified in Secs. 410.50 and 410.52 of this chapter.
    (b) Providing procedures and criteria under which a facility may 
receive an exception to the prospective payment rates; and
    (c) Establishing procedures that a facility must follow to appeal 
its payment amount under the prospective payment system.


<R05>
Sec. 413.172  Principles of prospective payment.

    (a) Payments for outpatient maintenance dialysis are based on rates 
set prospectively by HCFA.
    (b) All approved ESRD facilities must accept the prospective payment 
rates established by HCFA as payment in full for covered outpatient 
maintenance dialysis.
    (c) HCFA publishes the methodology used to establish payment rates 
and the changes specified in Sec. 413.196(b) in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 413.174  Prospective rates for hospital-based and independent ESRD facilities.

    (a) Establishment of rates. HCFA establishes prospective payment 
rates for ESRD facilities using a methodology that--
    (1) Differentiates between hospital-based facilities and independent 
ESRD facilities;
    (2) Effectively encourages efficient delivery of dialysis services; 
and
    (3) Provides incentives for increasing the use of home dialysis.
    (b) Determination of independent facility. For purposes of rate-
setting and payment under this section, HCFA considers any facility that 
does not meet all of the criteria of a hospital-based facility to be an 
independent facility. A determination under this paragraph (b) is an 
initial determination under Sec. 498.3 of this chapter.
    (c) Determination of hospital-based facility. A determination under 
this paragraph (c) is an initial determination under Sec. 498.3 of this 
chapter. For purposes of rate-setting and payment under this section, 
HCFA determines that a facility is hospital-based if the--
    (1) Facility and hospital are subject to the bylaws and operating 
decisions of a common governing board. This governing board, which has 
final administrative responsibility, approves all personnel actions, 
appoints medical staff, and carries out similar management functions;
    (2) Facility's director or administrator is under the supervision of 
the hospital's chief executive officer and

[[Page 448]]

reports through him or her to the governing board;
    (3) Facility personnel policies and practices conform to those of 
the hospital;
    (4) Administrative functions of the facility (for example, records, 
billing, laundry, housekeeping, and purchasing) are integrated with 
those of the hospital; and
    (5) Facility and hospital are financially integrated, as evidenced 
by the cost report, which reflects allocation of overhead to the 
facility through the required step-down methodology.
    (d) Nondetermination of hospital-based facility. In determining 
whether a facility is hospital-based, HCFA does not consider--
    (1) An agreement between a facility and a hospital concerning 
patient referral;
    (2) A shared service arrangement between a facility and a hospital; 
or
    (3) The physical location of a facility on the premises of a 
hospital.
    (e) Add-on amounts. If all the physicians furnishing services to 
patients in an ESRD facility elect the initial method of payment (as 
described in Sec. 414.313(c) of this chapter), the prospective rate (as 
described in paragraph (a) of this section) paid to that facility is 
increased by an add-on amount as described in Sec. 414.313.
    (f) Erythropoietin/Epoietin (EPO). (1) When EPO is furnished to an 
ESRD patient by a Medicare-approved ESRD facility or a supplier of home 
dialysis equipment and supplies, payment is based on the amount 
specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
    (2) The payment is made only on an assignment basis, that is, 
directly to the facility or supplier, which must accept, as payment in 
full, the amount that HCFA determines.
    (3) HCFA determines the payment amount in accordance with the 
following rules:
    (i) The amount is prospectively determined, as specified in section 
1881(b)(11)(B)(ii) of the Act, reviewed and adjusted by HCFA, as 
necessary, and paid to hospital-based and independent dialysis 
facilities and to suppliers of home dialysis equipment and supplies, 
regardless of the location of the facility, supplier, or patient.
    (ii) If HCFA determines that an adjustment to the payment amount is 
necessary, HCFA publishes a Federal Register notice proposing a revision 
to the EPO payment amount and requesting public comment.
    (iii) Any increase in this amount for a year does not exceed the 
percentage increase (if any) in the implicit price deflator for gross 
national product (as published by the Department of Commerce) for the 
second quarter of the preceding year over the implicit price deflator 
for the second quarter of the second preceding year.
    (iv) The Medicare payment amount is subject to the Part B deductible 
and coinsurance.
    (g) Additional payment for certain drugs. In addition to the 
prospective payment described in this section, HCFA makes an additional 
payment for certain drugs furnished to ESRD patients by a Medicare-
approved ESRD facility. HCFA makes this payment directly to the ESRD 
facility. The facility must accept the allowance determined by HCFA as 
payment in full. Payment for these drugs is made as follows:
    (1) Hospital-based facilities. HCFA makes payments in accordance 
with the cost reimbursement rules set forth in this part.
    (2) Independent facilities. HCFA makes payment in accordance with 
the methodology set forth in Sec. 405.517 of this chapter for paying for 
drugs that are not paid on a cost or prospective payment basis.


<R05>
Sec. 413.176  Amount of payments.

    (a) If the beneficiary has incurred the full deductible applicable 
under Part B of Medicare before the dialysis treatment, the intermediary 
pays the facility 80 percent of its prospective payment rate.
    (b) If the beneficiary has not incurred the full deductible 
applicable under Part B of Medicare before the dialysis treatment, the 
intermediary subtracts the amount applicable to the deductible from the 
facility's prospective rate and pays the facility 80 percent of the 
remainder, if any.

[[Page 449]]


<R05>
Sec. 413.178  Bad debts.

    (a) HCFA will reimburse each facility its allowable Medicare bad 
debts, as defined in Sec. 413.80(b), up to the facility's costs, as 
determined under Medicare principles, in a single lump sum payment at 
the end of the facility's cost reporting period.
    (b) A facility must attempt to collect deductible and coinsurance 
amounts owed by beneficiaries before requesting reimbursement from HCFA 
for uncollectible amounts. Section 413.80 specifies the collection 
efforts facilities must make.
    (c) A facility must request payment for uncollectible deductible and 
coinsurance amounts owed by beneficiaries by submitting an itemized list 
that specifically enumerates all uncollectable amounts related to 
covered services under the composite rate.


<R05>
Sec. 413.180  Procedures for requesting exceptions to payment rates.

    (a) Outpatient maintenance dialysis payments. All payments for 
outpatient maintenance dialysis furnished at or by facilities are made 
on the basis of prospective payment rates.
    (b) Criteria for requesting an exception. If a facility projects on 
the basis of prior year costs and utilization trends that it will have 
an allowable cost per treatment higher than its prospective rate set 
under Sec. 413.174, and if these excess costs are attributable to one or 
more of the factors in Sec. 413.182, the facility may request, in 
accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, that HCFA approve an 
exception to that rate and set a higher prospective payment rate. 
However, a facility may only request an exception or seek to retain its 
previously approved exception rate when authorized under the conditions 
specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.
    (c) Application of deductible and coinsurance. The higher payment 
rate is subject to the application of deductible and coinsurance in 
accordance with Sec. 413.176.
    (d) Payment rate exception request. A facility must request an 
exception to its payment rate within 180 days of--
    (1) The effective date of its new composite payment rate(s);
    (2) The effective date that HCFA opens the exceptions process; or
    (3) The date on which an extraordinary cost-increasing event occurs, 
as specified (or provided for) in Secs. 413.182(c) and 413.188.
    (e) Criteria for retaining a previously approved exception rate. A 
facility may elect to retain its previously approved exception rate in 
lieu of any composite rate increase or any other exception amount if--
    (1) The conditions under which the exception was granted have not 
changed;
    (2) The facility files a request to retain the rate with its fiscal 
intermediary during the 30-day period before the opening of an exception 
cycle; and
    (3) The request is approved by the fiscal intermediary.
    (f) Documentation for a payment rate exception request. If the 
facility is requesting an exception to its payment rate, it must submit 
to HCFA its most recently completed cost report as required under 
Sec. 413.198 and whatever statistics, data, and budgetary projections as 
determined by HCFA to be needed to adjudicate each type of exception. 
HCFA may audit any cost report or other information submitted. The 
materials submitted to HCFA must--
    (1) Separately identify elements of cost contributing to costs per 
treatment in excess of the facility's payment rate;
    (2) Show that the facility's costs, including those costs that are 
not directly attributable to the exception criteria, are allowable and 
reasonable under the reasonable cost principles set forth in this part;
    (3) Show that the elements of excessive cost are specifically 
attributable to one or more conditions specified in Sec. 413.182;
    (4) Specify the amount of additional payment per treatment the 
facility believes is required for it to recover its justifiable excess 
costs; and
    (5) Specify that the facility has compared its most recently 
completed cost report with cost reports from (at least 2) prior years. 
The facility must explain any material statistical data or cost changes, 
or both, and include an

[[Page 450]]

explanation with the documentation supporting the exception request.
    (g) Completion of requirements and criteria. The facility must 
demonstrate to HCFA's satisfaction that the requirements of this section 
and the criteria in Sec. 413.182 are fully met. The burden of proof is 
on the facility to show that one or more of the criteria are met and 
that the excessive costs are justifiable under the reasonable cost 
principles set forth in this part.
    (h) Approval of an exception request. An exception request is deemed 
approved unless it is disapproved within 60 working days after it is 
filed with its intermediary.
    (i) Determination of an exception request. In determining the 
facility's payment rate under the exception process, HCFA excludes all 
costs that are not reasonable or allowable under the reasonable cost 
principles set forth in this part.
    (j) Period of approval: Payment exception request. Except for 
exceptions approved under Secs. 413.180(e), 413.180(k), 413.182(c), and 
413.188, a prospective exception payment rate approved by HCFA applies 
for the period from the date the complete exception request was filed 
with its intermediary until the earlier of the--
    (1) Date the circumstances justifying the exception rate no longer 
exist; or
    (2) End of the period during which the announced rate was to apply.
    (k) Period of approval: Payment exception request under 
Secs. 413.182(c) and 413.188. A prospective exception payment rate 
approved by HCFA under Secs. 413.182(c) and 413.188 applies from the 
date of the extraordinary event until the end of the period during which 
the prospective announced rate was to apply, unless HCFA determines that 
another date is more appropriate. If HCFA does not extend the exception 
period and the facility believes that it continues to require an 
exception to its rate, the facility must reapply in accordance with the 
procedures in this section.
    (l) Denial of an exception request. HCFA denies exception requests 
submitted without the documentation specified in Sec. 413.182 and the 
applicable regulations cited there.
    (m) Criteria for refiling a denied exception request. A facility 
that has been denied an exception request during the 180 days may file 
another exception request if all required documentation is filed with 
the intermediary by the 180th day.


<R05>
Sec. 413.182  Criteria for approval of exception requests.

    HCFA may approve exceptions to an ESRD facility's prospective 
payment rate if the facility demonstrates, by convincing objective 
evidence, that its total per treatment costs are reasonable and 
allowable under the relevant cost reimbursement principles of part 413 
and that its per treatment costs in excess of its payment rate are 
directly attributable to any of the following criteria:
    (a) Atypical service intensity (patient mix), as specified in 
Sec. 413.184.
    (b) Isolated essential facility, as specified in Sec. 413.186.
    (c) Extraordinary circumstances, as specified in Sec. 413.188.
    (d) Self-dialysis training costs, as specified in Sec. 413.190.
    (e) Frequency of dialysis, as specified in Sec. 413.192.


<R05>
Sec. 413.184  Payment exception: Atypical service intensity (patient mix).

    (a) To qualify for an exception to the prospective payment rate 
based on atypical service intensity (patient mix)--
    (1) A facility must demonstrate that a substantial proportion of the 
facility's outpatient maintenance dialysis treatments involve atypically 
intense dialysis services, special dialysis procedures, or supplies that 
are medically necessary to meet special medical needs of the facility's 
patients. Examples that may qualify under this criterion are more 
intense dialysis services that are medically necessary for patients such 
as--
    (i) Patients who have been referred from other facilities on a 
temporary basis for more intense care during a period of medical 
instability and who return to the original facility after stabilization;
    (ii) Pediatric patients who require a significantly higher staff-to-
patient ratio than typical adult patients; or

[[Page 451]]

    (iii) Patients with medical conditions that are not commonly treated 
by ESRD facilities and that complicate the dialysis procedure.
    (2) The facility must demonstrate clearly that these services, 
procedures, or supplies and its per treatment costs are prudent and 
reasonable when compared to those of facilities with a similar patient 
mix.
    (3) A facility must demonstrate that--
    (i) Its nursing personnel costs have been allocated properly between 
each mode of care; and
    (ii) The additional nursing hours per treatment are not the result 
of an excess number of employees.
    (b) Documentation. (1) A facility must submit a listing of all 
outpatient dialysis patients (including all home patients) treated 
during the most recently completed fiscal or calendar year showing--
    (i) Patients who received transplants, including the date of 
transplant;
    (ii) Patients awaiting a transplant who are medically able, have 
given consent, and are on an active transplant list, and projected 
transplants;
    (iii) Home patients;
    (iv) In-facility patients, staff-assisted, or self-dialysis;
    (v) Individual patient diagnosis;
    (vi) Diabetic patients;
    (vii) Patients isolated because of contagious disease;
    (viii) Age of patients;
    (ix) Mortality rate, by age and diagnosis;
    (x) Number of patient transfers, reasons for transfers, and any 
related information; and
    (xi) Total number of hospital admissions for the facility's 
patients, reason for, and length of stay of each session.
    (2) The facility also must--
    (i) Submit documentation on costs of nursing personnel (registered 
nurses, licensed practical nurses, technicians, and aides) incurred 
during the most recently completed fiscal year cost report showing--
    (A) Amount each employee was paid;
    (B) Number of personnel;
    (C) Amount of time spent in the dialysis unit; and
    (D) Staff-to-patient ratio based on total hours, with an analysis of 
productive and nonproductive hours.
    (ii) Submit documentation on supply costs incurred during the most 
recently completed fiscal or calendar year cost report showing--
    (A) By modality, a complete list of supplies used routinely in a 
dialysis treatment;
    (B) The make and model number of each dialyzer and its component 
cost; and
    (C) That supplies are prudently purchased (for example, that bulk 
discounts are used when available).
    (iii) Submit documentation on overhead costs incurred during the 
most recently completed fiscal or calendar year cost reporting year 
showing--
    (A) The basis of the higher overhead costs;
    (B) The impact on the specific cost components; and
    (C) The effect on per treatment costs.


<R05>
Sec. 413.186  Payment exception: Isolated essential facility.

    (a) Qualifications. To qualify for an exception to the prospective 
payment rate based on being an isolated essential facility--
    (1) The facility must be the only supplier of dialysis in its 
geographical area;
    (2) The facility's patients must be unable to obtain dialysis 
services elsewhere without substantial additional hardship; and
    (3) The facility's excess costs must be justifiable.
    (b) Criteria for determining qualifications. In determining whether 
a facility qualifies for an exception based on its being an isolated 
essential facility, HCFA considers--
    (1) Local, permanent residential population density;
    (2) Typical local commuting distances from medical services;
    (3) Volume of treatments; and
    (4) The extent that other dialysis facilities are used by area 
residents (other than the applying facility's patients).
    (c) Documentation. (1) Isolated. Generally, to be considered 
isolated, the

[[Page 452]]

facility must document that it is located outside an established 
Metropolitan Statistical Area and provides dialysis to a permanent 
patient population, as opposed to a transient patient population.
    (2) Essential. To be considered essential, the facility must 
document--
    (i) That a substantial number of its patients cannot obtain dialysis 
services elsewhere without additional hardship; and
    (ii) The additional hardship the patients will incur in travel time 
and cost.
    (3) Cost per treatment. The facility must--
    (i) Document that its cost per treatment is reasonable; and
    (ii) Explain how the facility's cost per treatment in excess of its 
composite rate relates to the isolated essential facility criteria 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (4) Additional information. The facility must also furnish the 
following information in a format that concisely explains the facility's 
cost and patient data to support its request:
    (i) A list of current and requested payment rates for each modality.
    (ii) An explanation of how the facility's costs in excess of its 
composite rate payment are attributable to its being an isolated 
essential facility.
    (iii) An explanation of any unusual geographic conditions in the 
area surrounding the facility.
    (iv) A copy of the latest filed cost report and a budget estimate 
for the next 12 months prepared on cost report forms.
    (v) An explanation of unusual costs reported on the facility's 
actual or budgeted cost reports and any significant changes in budgeted 
costs and data compared to actual costs and data reported on the latest 
filed cost report.
    (vi) The name, location of, and distance to the nearest renal 
dialysis facility.
    (vii) A list of patients by modality showing commuting distance and 
time to the current and the next nearest renal dialysis facility.
    (viii) The historical and projected patient-to-staff ratios and 
number of machines used for maintenance dialysis treatments.
    (ix) A computation showing the facility's treatment capacity, 
arrived at by taking the total stations multiplied by the number of 
hours of operation for the year divided by the average length of a 
dialysis treatment.
    (x) The geographic boundaries and population size of the facility's 
service area.


<R05>
Sec. 413.188  Payment exception: Extraordinary circumstances.

    (a) To qualify for an exception to the prospective payment rate 
based on extraordinary circumstances, the facility must substantiate 
that it incurs excess costs beyond its control due to a fire, 
earthquake, flood, or other natural disaster.
    (b) HCFA will not grant an exception based on increased costs if a 
facility has chosen not to--
    (1) Maintain adequate insurance protection against such losses 
(through the purchase of insurance, the maintenance of a self-insurance 
program, or other equivalent alternative); or
    (2) File a claim for losses covered by insurance or utilize its 
self-insurance program.


<R05>
Sec. 413.190  Payment exception: Self-dialysis training costs.

    (a) Qualifications. To qualify for an exception to the prospective 
payment rate based on self-dialysis training costs, the facility must 
establish that it incurs per treatment costs for furnishing self-
dialysis and home dialysis training that exceed the facility's payment 
rate for such training sessions.
    (b) Justification. To justify its exception request, a facility 
must--
    (1) Separately identify those elements contributing to its costs in 
excess of the composite training rate; and
    (2) Demonstrate that its per treatment costs are reasonable and 
allowable.
    (c) Criteria for determining proper cost reporting. HCFA considers 
the facility's total costs, cost finding and apportionment, including 
its allocation of costs, to determine if costs are properly reported by 
treatment modality.
    (d) Limitation of exception requests. Exception requests for a 
higher training

[[Page 453]]

rate are limited to those cost components relating to training such as 
technical staff, medical supplies, and the special costs of education 
(manuals and education materials). These requests may include overhead 
and other indirect costs to the extent that these costs are directly 
attributable to the additional training costs.
    (e) Documentation. The facility must provide the following 
information to support its exception request:
    (1) A copy of the facility's training program.
    (2) Computation of the facility's cost per treatment for maintenance 
sessions and training sessions including an explanation of the cost 
difference between the two modalities.
    (3) Class size and patients' training schedules.
    (4) Number of training sessions required, by treatment modality, to 
train patients.
    (5) Number of patients trained for the current year and the prior 2 
years on a monthly basis.
    (6) Projection for the next 12 months of future training candidates.
    (7) The number and qualifications of staff at training sessions.
    (f) Accelerated training exception. (1) An ESRD facility may bill 
Medicare for a dialysis training session only when a patient receives a 
dialysis treatment (normally three times a week for hemodialysis). 
Continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) and continuous ambulatory 
peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) are daily treatment modalities; ESRD 
facilities are paid the equivalent of three hemodialysis treatments for 
each week that CCPD and CAPD treatments are provided.
    (2) If an ESRD facility elects to train all its patients using a 
particular treatment modality more often than during each dialysis 
treatment and, as a result, the number of billable training dialysis 
sessions is less than the number of actual training sessions, the 
facility may request a composite rate exception, limited to the lesser 
of the--
    (i) Facility's projected training cost per treatment; or
    (ii) Cost per treatment the facility would have received in training 
a patient if it had trained patients only during a dialysis treatment, 
that is, three times per week.
    (3) An ESRD facility may bill a maximum of 25 training sessions per 
patient for hemodialysis training and 15 sessions for CCPD and CAPD 
training.
    (4) In computing the payment amount under an accelerated training 
exception, HCFA uses a minimum number of training sessions per patient 
(15 for hemodialysis and 5 for CAPD and CCPD) when the facility actually 
provides fewer than the minimum number of training sessions.
    (5) To justify an accelerated training exception request, an ESRD 
facility must document that a significant number of training sessions 
for a particular modality are provided during a shorter but more 
condensed period.
    (6) The facility must submit with the exception request a list of 
patients, by modality, trained during the most recent cost report 
period. The list must include each beneficiary's--
    (i) Name;
    (ii) Age; and
    (iii) Training status (completed, not completed, being retrained, or 
in the process of being trained).
    (7) The total treatments from the patient list must be the same as 
the total treatments reported on the cost report filed with the request.


<R05>
Sec. 413.192  Payment exception: Frequency of dialysis.

    (a) Qualification. To qualify for an exception to the prospective 
payment rate based on frequency of dialysis, the facility must establish 
that it has a substantial portion of outpatient maintenance dialysis 
treatments furnished to patients who dialyze less frequently than three 
times per week.
    (b) Definition. For purposes of this section, ``substantial'' means 
the number of treatments furnished by the facility is at least 15 
percent lower than the number would be if all patients dialyzed three 
times a week.
    (c) Limitation for per treatment payment rates. Per treatment 
payment rates granted under this exception may not exceed the amount 
that produces weekly payments per patient equal to three times the 
facility's prospective composite rate, exclusive of any exception 
amounts.

[[Page 454]]

    (d) Documentation. To document that an ESRD facility furnishes a 
substantial number of dialysis treatments at a frequency less than three 
times per week per patient, the facility must submit the following 
information:
    (1) A list of patients receiving outpatient dialysis treatments for 
the cost report that is filed with the request. The list must indicate--
    (i) Whether the patients are permanent, transient, or temporary;
    (ii) The medically prescribed frequency of dialysis; and
    (iii) The number of dialysis treatments that each patient received 
on a weekly and yearly basis and an explanation of any discrepancy 
between that calculation and the number of treatments reported on the 
facility's cost report.
    (2) A list of patients used to project treatments. The list must 
indicate--
    (i) Whether the patients are permanent, transient, or temporary;
    (ii) The medically prescribed frequency of dialysis;
    (iii) The number of dialysis treatments that each patient is 
projected to receive on a weekly and yearly basis, an explanation of any 
discrepancy between that calculation and the number of treatments 
reported on the facility's projected cost report, and an explanation for 
any change among prior, actual, and projected data.
    (3) A schedule showing the number of treatments to be furnished 
twice a week and the number of treatments that would have been furnished 
if each patient were dialyzed three times a week.
    (4) A computation of the facility's projected costs per treatment 
using the--
    (i) Projected number of treatments furnished twice a week; and
    (ii) Number of treatments if patients dialyze three times a week.
    (5) A schedule showing the computation of the percentage decrease in 
the number of treatments.


<R05>
Sec. 413.194  Appeals.

    (a) Appeals under section 1878 of the Act. (1) A facility that 
disputes the amount of its allowable Medicare bad debts reimbursed by 
HCFA under Sec. 413.178 may request review by the intermediary or the 
Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB) in accordance with subpart R 
of part 405 of this chapter.
    (2) A facility must request and obtain a final agency decision prior 
to seeking judicial review of a dispute regarding the amount of 
allowable Medicare bad debts.
    (b) Other appeals. (1) A facility that has requested higher payment 
per treatment in accordance with Sec. 413.180 may request review from 
the intermediary or the PRRB if HCFA has denied the request in whole or 
in part. In such a case, the procedure in subpart R of part 405 of this 
chapter is followed to the extent that it is applicable.
    (2) The PRRB has the authority to review the action taken by HCFA on 
the facility's requests. However, the PRRB's decision is subject to 
review by the Administrator under Sec. 405.1875 of this chapter.
    (3) A facility must request and obtain a final agency decision, in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, prior to seeking 
judicial review of the denial, in whole or in part, of the exception 
request.
    (c) Procedure. (1) The facility must request review within 180 days 
of the date of the decision on which review is sought.
    (2) The facility may not submit to the reviewing entity, whether it 
is the intermediary or the PRRB, any additional information or cost data 
that had not been submitted to HCFA at the time HCFA evaluated the 
exception request.
    (d) Determining amount in controversy. For purposes of determining 
PRRB jurisdiction under subpart R of part 405 of this chapter for the 
appeals described in paragraph (b) of this section--
    (1) The amount in controversy per treatment is determined by 
subtracting the amount of program payment from the amount the facility 
requested under Sec. 413.180; and
    (2) The total amount in controversy is calculated by multiplying the 
amount in controversy per treatment by the projected number of 
treatments for the exception request period.

[[Page 455]]


<R05>
Sec. 413.196  Notification of changes in rate-setting methodologies and payment rates.

    (a) HCFA or the facility's intermediary notifies each facility of 
changes in its payment rate. This notice includes changes in individual 
facility payment rates resulting from corrections or revisions of 
particular geographic labor cost adjustment factors.
    (b) Changes in payment rates resulting from incorporation of updated 
cost data or general revisions of geographic labor cost adjustment 
factors are announced by notice published in the Federal Register 
without opportunity for prior comment. Revisions of the rate-setting 
methodology are published in the Federal Register in accordance with the 
Department's established rulemaking procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 413.198  Recordkeeping and cost reporting requirements for outpatient maintenance dialysis.

    (a) Purpose and Scope. This section implements section 
1881(b)(2)(B)(i) of the Act by specifying recordkeeping and cost 
reporting requirements for ESRD facilities approved under subpart U of 
part 405 of this chapter. The records and reports will enable HCFA to 
determine the costs incurred in furnishing outpatient maintenance 
dialysis as defined in Sec. 413.170(a).
    (b) Recordkeeping and reporting requirements. (1) Each facility must 
keep adequate records and submit the appropriate HCFA-approved cost 
report in accordance with Secs. 413.20 and 413.24, which provide rules 
on financial data and reports, and adequate cost data and cost finding, 
respectively.
    (2) The cost reimbursement principles set forth in this part 
(beginning with Sec. 413.134, Depreciation, and excluding the principles 
listed in paragraph (b)(4) of this section), apply in the determination 
and reporting of the allowable cost incurred in furnishing outpatient 
maintenance dialysis treatments to patients dialyzing in the facility, 
or incurred by the facility in furnishing home dialysis service, 
supplies, and equipment.
    (3) Allowable cost is the reasonable cost related to dialysis 
treatments. Reasonable cost includes all necessary and proper expenses 
incurred by the facility in furnishing the dialysis treatments, such as 
administrative costs, maintenance costs, and premium payments for 
employee health and pension plans. It includes both direct and indirect 
costs and normal standby costs. Reasonable cost does not include costs 
that--
    (i) Are not related to patient care for outpatient maintenance 
dialysis;
    (ii) Are for services or items specifically not reimbursable under 
the program;
    (iii) Flow from the provision of luxury items or servicess (items or 
services substantially in excess of or more expensive than those 
generally considered necessary for the provision of needed health 
services); or
    (iv) Are found to be substantially out of line with other 
institutions in the same area that are similar in size, scope of 
services, utilization, and other relevant factors.
    (4) The following principles of this part do not apply in 
determining adjustments to allowable costs as reported by ESRD 
facilities:
    (i) Section 413.157, Return on equity capital of proprietary 
providers;
    (ii) Section 413.200, Reimbursement of OPAs and histocompatibility 
laboratories;
    (iii) Section 413.9, Cost related to patient care (except for the 
principles stated in paragraph (b)(3) of this section); and
    (iv) Sections 413.64, Payments to providers, and Secs. 413.13, 
413.30, 413.35, 413.40, 413.74, and Secs. 415.55 through 415.70, 
Sec. 415.162, and Sec. 415.164 of this chapter, Principles of 
reimbursement for services by hospital-based physicians.


<R05>
Sec. 413.200  Payment of independent organ procurement organizations and histocompatibility laboratories.

    (a) Principle. Covered services furnished after September 30, 1978 
by organ procurement organizations (OPOs) and histocompatibility 
laboratories in connection with kidney acquisition and transplantation 
will be reimbursed under the principles for determining reasonable cost 
contained in this part. Services furnished by freestanding OPOs and 
histocompatibility laboratories, that have an agreement

[[Page 456]]

with the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, 
will be reimbursed by making an interim payment to the transplant 
hospitals using these services and by making a retroactive adjustment, 
directly with the OPO or laboratory, based upon a cost report filed by 
the OPO or laboratory. (The reasonable costs of services furnished by 
hospital based OPOs or laboratories will be reimbursed in accordance 
with the principles contained in Secs. 413.60 and 413.64.)
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
    Freestanding refers to an OPO or a histocompatibility laboratory 
that is not--
    (1) Subject to the control of the hospital with respect to the 
hiring, firing, training, and paying of employees; and
    (2) Considered as a department of the hospital for insurance 
purposes (including malpractice insurance, general liability insurance, 
worker's compensation insurance, and employee retirement insurance).
    Histocompatibility laboratory means a laboratory meeting the 
standards and providing the services for kidneys or other organs set 
forth in Sec. 413.2171(d) of this chapter.
    OPO means an organization defined in Sec. 486.302 of this chapter.
    (c) Agreements with independent OPOs and laboratories. (1) Any 
freestanding OPO or histocompatibility laboratory that wishes to have 
the cost of its pretransplant services reimbursed under the Medicare 
program must file an agreement with HCFA under which the OPO or 
laboratory agrees--
    (i) To file a cost report in accordance with Sec. 413.24(f) within 
three months after the end of each fiscal year;
    (ii) To permit HCFA to designate an intermediary to determine the 
interim reimbursement rate payable to the transplant hospitals for 
services provided by the OPO or laboratory and to make a determination 
of reasonable cost based upon the cost report filed by the OPO or 
laboratory;
    (iii) To provide such budget or cost projection information as may 
be required to establish an initial interim reimbursement rate;
    (iv) To pay to HCFA amounts that have been paid by HCFA to 
transplant hospitals and that are determined to be in excess of the 
reasonable cost of the services provided by the OPO or laboratory; and
    (v) Not to charge any individual for items or services for which 
that individual is entitled to have payment made under section 1861 of 
the Act.
    (2) The initial cost report due from an OPO or laboratory is for its 
first fiscal year during any portion of which it had an agreement with 
the Secretary under paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section. The 
initial cost report covers only the period covered by the agreement.
    (d) Interim reimbursement. (1) Hospitals eligible to receive 
Medicare reimbursement for renal transplantation will be paid for the 
pretransplantation services of a freestanding OPO or histocompatibility 
laboratory that has an agreement with the Secretary under paragraph (c) 
of this section, on the basis of an interim rate established by an 
intermediary for that OPO or laboratory.
    (2) The interim rate will be based on the average cost per service 
incurred by an OPO or laboratory, during its previous fiscal year, 
associated with procuring a kidney for transplantation. This interim 
rate may be adjusted if necessary for anticipated cost changes. If there 
is not adequate cost data to determine the initial interim rate, it will 
be determined according to the OPO's or laboratory's estimate of its 
projected costs for the fiscal year.
    (3) Payments made on the basis of the interim rate will be 
reconciled directly with the OPO or laboratory after the close of its 
fiscal year, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
    (4) Information on the interim rate for all freestanding OPOs and 
histocompatibility laboratories shall be disseminated to all transplant 
hospitals and intermediaries.
    (e) Retroactive adjustment. (1) Cost reports. Information provided 
in cost reports by freestanding OPOs and histocompatibility laboratories 
must meet the requirements for cost data and cost finding specified in 
paragraphs (a) through (e) of Sec. 413.24. These cost reports must 
provide a complete accounting of the cost incurred by the agency or 
laboratory in providing covered

[[Page 457]]

services, the total number of Medicare beneficiaries who received those 
services, and any other data necessary to enable the intermediary to 
make a determination of the reasonable cost of covered services provided 
to Medicare beneficiaries.
    (2) Audit and adjustment. A cost report submitted by a freestanding 
OPO or histocompatibility laboratory will be reviewed by the 
intermediary and a new interim reimbursement rate for the succeeding 
fiscal year will be established based upon this review. A retroactive 
adjustment in the amount paid under the interim rate will be made in 
accordance with Sec. 413.64(f). If the determination of reasonable cost 
reveals an overpayment or underpayment resulting from the interim 
reimbursement rate paid to transplant hospitals, a lump sum adjustment 
will be made directly between that intermediary and the OPO or 
laboratory.
    (f) For services furnished on or after April 1, 1988, no payment may 
be made for services furnished by an OPO that does not meet the 
requirements of part 485, subpart D of this chapter.
    (g) Appeals. Any OPO or histocompatibility laboratory that disagrees 
with an intermediary's cost determination under this section is entitled 
to an intermediary hearing, in accordance with the procedures contained 
in Secs. 405.1811 through 405.1833, if the amount in controversy is 
$1,000 or more.


<R05>
Sec. 413.202  Organ procurement organization (OPO) cost for kidneys sent to foreign countries or transplanted in patients other than Medicare beneficiaries.

    An OPO's total costs for all kidneys is reduced by the costs 
associated with procuring kidneys sent to foreign transplant centers or 
transplanted in patients other than Medicare beneficiaries. OPOs, as 
defined in Sec. 435.302 of this chapter, must separate costs for 
procuring kidneys that are sent to foreign transplant centers and 
kidneys transplanted in patients other than Medicare beneficiaries from 
Medicare allowable costs prior to final settlement by the Medicare 
fiscal intermediaries. Medicare costs are based on the ratio of the 
number of usable kidneys transplanted into Medicare beneficiaries to the 
total number of usable kidneys applied to reasonable costs. Certain 
long-standing arrangements that existed before March 3, 1988 (for 
example, an OPO that procures kidneys at a military transplant hospital 
for transplant at that hospital), will be deemed to be Medicare kidneys 
for cost reporting statistical purposes. The OPO must submit a request 
to the fiscal intermediary for review and approval of these 
arrangements.


<R05>
Sec. 413.203  Transplant center costs for organs sent to foreign countries or transplanted in patients other than Medicare beneficiaries.

    (a) A transplant center's total costs for all organs is reduced by 
the costs associated with procuring organs sent to foreign transplant 
centers or transplanted in patients other than Medicare beneficiaries. 
Organs are defined in Sec. 486.302 (only covered organs will be paid for 
on a reasonable cost basis).
    (b) Transplant center hospitals must separate costs for procuring 
organs that are sent to foreign transplant centers and organs 
transplanted in patients other than Medicare beneficiaries from Medicare 
allowable costs prior to final cost settlement by the Medicare fiscal 
intermediaries.
    (c) Medicare costs are based on the ratio of the number of usable 
organs transplanted into Medicare beneficiaries to the total number of 
usable organs applied to reasonable costs.

    Source:  60 FR 37594, July 21, 1995, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 413.300  Basis and scope.

    (a) Basis. This subpart implements section 1888(d) of the Act, which 
provides for optional prospectively determined payment rates for 
qualified SNFs.
    (b) Scope. This subpart sets forth the eligibility criteria an SNF 
must meet

[[Page 458]]

to qualify, the process governing election of prospectively determined 
payment rates, and the basis and methodology for determining 
prospectively determined payment rates.


<R05>
Sec. 413.302  Definitions.

    For purposes of this subpart--
    Area wage level means the average wage per hour for all 
classifications of employees as reported by health care facilities 
within a specified area.
    Census region means one of the 9 census divisions, comprising the 50 
States and the District of Columbia, established by the Bureau of the 
Census for statistical and reporting purposes.
    Routine capital-related costs means the capital-related costs, 
allowable for Medicare purposes (as described in Subpart G of this 
Part), that are allocated to the SNF participating inpatient routine 
service cost center as reported on the Medicare cost report.
    Routine operating costs means the cost of regular room, dietary, and 
nursing services, and minor medical and surgical supplies for which a 
separate charge is not customarily made. It does not include the costs 
of ancillary services, capital-related costs, or, where appropriate, 
return on equity.
    Rural area means any area outside an urban area in a census region.
    Urban area means a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or New 
England County Metropolitan Area (NECMA), as defined by the Office of 
Management and Budget, or a New England county deemed to be an urban 
area, as listed in Sec. 412.62(f)(1)(ii)(B) of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 413.304  Eligibility for prospectively determined payment rates.

    (a) General rule. An SNF is eligible to receive a prospectively 
determined payment rate for a cost reporting period if it had fewer than 
1,500 Medicare covered inpatient days as reported on a Medicare cost 
report in its immediately preceding cost reporting period. This 
criterion applies even if the SNF received a prospectively determined 
payment rate during the preceding cost reporting period.
    (b) Less than a full cost reporting period. If the cost reporting 
period that precedes an SNF's request for prospectively determined 
payment is not a full cost reporting period, the SNF is eligible to 
receive prospectively determined payment rates only if the average daily 
Medicare census for the period (Medicare inpatient days divided by the 
total number of days in the cost reporting period) is not greater than 
4.1.
    (c) Newly-participating SNFs. An SNF is eligible to receive 
prospectively determined payment rates for its first cost reporting 
period for which it is approved to participate in Medicare.


<R05>
Sec. 413.308  Rules governing election of prospectively determined payment rates.

    (a) Requirements. An SNF must notify its intermediary at least 30 
calendar days before the beginning of the cost reporting period for 
which it requests to receive such payment that it elects prospectively 
determined payment rates. A separate request must be made for each cost 
reporting period for which an SNF seeks prospectively determined 
payment. A newly participating SNF with no preceding cost reporting 
period must make its election within 30 days of its notification of 
approval to participate in Medicare.
    (b) Intermediary notice. After evaluating an SNF's request for 
prospectively determined payment rates, the intermediary notifies the 
SNF in writing as to whether the SNF meets any of the eligibility 
criteria described in Sec. 413.304 and the timely election requirements 
under Sec. 413.308(a). The intermediary must notify the SNF of its 
initial and final determinations within 10 working days after it 
receives all the data necessary to make each determination. The 
intermediary's determination is limited to one cost reporting period.
    (c) Prohibition against revocation. An SNF may not revoke its 
request after it has received the initial determination of eligibility 
from the intermediary and the cost reporting period has begun.
    (d) Revocation by intermediary. If an SNF is given tentative 
approval to receive a prospectively determined payment rate, and, after 
the start of the applicable cost reporting period, the intermediary 
determines that the SNF does not meet the eligibility criteria,

[[Page 459]]

the intermediary must revoke the prospectively determined payment 
option.


<R05>
Sec. 413.310  Basis of payment.

    (a) Method of payment. Under the prospectively determined payment 
rate system, a qualified SNF receives a per diem payment of a 
predetermined rate for inpatient services furnished to Medicare 
beneficiaries. Each SNF's routine per diem payment rate is determined 
according to the methodology described in Sec. 413.312 and is based on 
various components of SNF costs.
    (b) Payment in full. The payment rate represents payment in full for 
routine services as described in Sec. 413.314 (subject to applicable 
coinsurance as described in Subpart G of Part 409 of this title), and 
for routine capital costs. Payment is made in lieu of payment on a 
reasonable cost basis for routine services and for routine capital 
costs.


<R05>
Sec. 413.312  Methodology for calculating rates.

    (a) Data used. (1) To calculate the prospectively determined payment 
rates, HCFA uses:
    (i) The SNF cost data that were used to develop the applicable 
routine service cost limits;
    (ii) A wage index to adjust for area wage differences; and
    (iii) The most recent projections of increases in the costs from the 
SNF market basket index.
    (2) In the annual schedule of rates published in the Federal 
Register under the authority of Sec. 413.320, HCFA announces the wage 
index and the annual percentage increases in the market basket used in 
the calculation of the rates.
    (b) Calculation of per diem rate. (1) Routine operating component of 
rate--(i) Adjusting cost report data. The SNF market basket index is 
used to adjust the routine operating cost from the SNF cost report to 
reflect cost increases occurring between cost reporting periods 
represented in the data collected and the midpoint of the initial cost 
reporting period to which the payment rates apply.
    (ii) Calculating a per diem cost. For each SNF, an adjusted routine 
operating per diem cost is computed by dividing the adjusted routine 
operating cost (see paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section) by the SNF's 
total patient days.
    (iii) Adjusting for wage levels. (A) The SNF's adjusted per diem 
routine operating cost calculated under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this 
section is then divided into labor-related and nonlabor-related 
portions.
    (B) The labor-related portion is obtained by multiplying the SNF's 
adjusted per diem routine operating cost by a percentage that represents 
the labor-related portion of cost from the market basket. This 
percentage is published when the revised rates are published as 
described in Sec. 413.320.
    (C) The labor-related portion of each SNF's per diem cost is divided 
by the wage index applicable to the SNF's geographic location to arrive 
at the adjusted labor-related portion of routine cost.
    (iv) Group means. SNFs are grouped by urban or rural location by 
census region. Separate means of adjusted labor-related and nonlabor 
routine operating costs for each SNF group are established in accordance 
with the SNF's region and urban or rural location. For each group, the 
mean labor-related and mean nonlabor-related per diem routine operating 
costs are multiplied by 105 percent.
    (2) Computation of routine capital-related cost.
    (i) The SNF routine capital-related cost for both direct and 
indirect capital costs allocated to routine services, as reported on the 
Medicare cost report, is obtained for each SNF in the data base.
    (ii) For each SNF, the per diem capital-related cost is calculated 
by dividing the SNF's routine capital costs by its inpatient days.
    (iii) SNFs are grouped by urban and rural location by census region, 
and mean per diem routine capital-related cost is determined for each 
group.
    (iv) Each group mean per diem capital-related cost is multiplied by 
105 percent.
    (3) Computation of return on owner's equity for services furnished 
before October 1, 1993. (i) Each proprietary SNF's Medicare return on 
equity is obtained from its cost report and the portion attributable to 
the routine service cost is determined as described in Sec. 413.157.

[[Page 460]]

    (ii) For each proprietary SNF, per diem return on equity is 
calculated by dividing the routine cost related return on equity 
determined under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section by the SNF's total 
Medicare inpatient days.
    (iii) Separate group means are computed for per diem return on 
equity of proprietary SNFs, based on regional and urban or rural 
classification.
    (iv) Each group mean is multiplied by 105 percent.


<R05>
Sec. 413.314  Determining payment amounts: Routine per diem rate.

    (a) General rule. An SNF that elects to be paid under the 
prospectively determined payment rate system, and qualifies for such 
payment, is paid a per diem rate for inpatient routine services. This 
rate is adjusted to reflect area wage differences and the cost reporting 
period beginning date (if necessary) and is subject to the limitation 
specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) Per diem rate. The prospectively determined payment rate for 
each urban and rural area in each census region is comprised of the 
following:
    (1) A routine operating component, which is divided into:
    (i) A labor-related portion adjusted by the appropriate wage index; 
and
    (ii) A nonlabor-related portion.
    (2) A routine capital-related cost portion.
    (3) For proprietary SNFs only, a portion that is based on the return 
on owner's equity related to routine cost, applicable only for services 
furnished before October 1, 1993.
    (c) Adjustment for cost reporting period. (1) If a facility has a 
cost reporting period beginning after the beginning of the Federal 
fiscal year, the intermediary increases the labor-related and nonlabor-
related portions of the prospective payment rate that would otherwise 
apply to the SNF by an adjustment factor. Each factor represents the 
projected increase in the market basket index for a specific 12-month 
period. The factors are used to account for inflation in costs for cost 
reporting periods beginning after October 1. Adjustment factors are 
published in the annual notice of prospectively determined payment rates 
described in Sec. 413.320.
    (2) If a facility uses a cost reporting period that is not 12 months 
in duration, the intermediary must obtain a special adjustment factor 
from HCFA for the specific period.
    (d) Limitation of prospectively determined payment rate. The per 
diem prospectively determined payment rate for an SNF, excluding 
capital-related costs and excluding return on equity for services 
furnished prior to October 1, 1993, may not exceed the individual SNF's 
routine service cost limit. Under Sec. 413.30, the routine service cost 
limit is the limit determined without regard to exemptions, exceptions, 
or retroactive adjustments, and is the actual limit in effect when the 
provider elects to be paid a prospectively determined payment rate.


<R05>
Sec. 413.316  Determining payment amounts: Ancillary services.

    Ancillary services are paid on the basis of reasonable cost in 
accordance with section 1861(v)(1) of the Act and Sec. 413.53.


<R05>
Sec. 413.320  Publication of prospectively determined payment rates or amounts.

    At least 90 days before the beginning of a Federal fiscal year to 
which revised prospectively determined payment rates are to be applied, 
HCFA publishes a notice in the Federal Register:
    (a) Establishing the prospectively determined payment rates for 
routine services; and
    (b) Explaining the basis on which the prospectively determined 
payment rates are calculated.


<R05>
Sec. 413.321  Simplified cost report for SNFs.

    SNFs electing to be paid under the prospectively determined payment 
rate system may file a simplified cost report. The cost report contains 
a simplified method of cost finding to be used in lieu of cost methods 
described in Sec. 413.24(d). This method is specified in the 
instructions for Form HCFA-2540S, contained in sections 3000-3027.3 of 
Part 2 of the Provider Reimbursement Manual. This form may not be

[[Page 461]]

used by hospital-based SNFs or SNFs that are part of a health care 
complex. Those SNFs must file a cost report that reflects the shared 
services and administrative costs of the hospital and any other related 
facilities in the health care complex.

Sec. 414.20  Formula for computing payment amounts.

    Under the formula set forth in section 1848(b)(1) of the Act, the 
fee schedule payment amount for a service defined as a ``physicians' 
service'' in section 1848(j)(3) of the Act is computed as the product of 
the following amounts:
    (a) The relative value for the service.
    (b) The geographic adjustment factor (GAF) for the fee schedule 
area.
    (c) The conversion factor (CF).


<R05>
Sec. 414.22  Relative value units (RVUs).

    HCFA establishes RVUs for physician work, physician practice 
expense, and malpractice insurance.
    (a) Physician work RVUs--(1) General rule. Physician work RVUs are 
established using a relative value scale in which the value of physician 
work for a particular service is rated relative to the value of work for 
other physician services.
    (2) Special RVUs for anesthesia and radiology services)--(i) 
Anesthesia services. The rules for determining RVUs for anesthesia 
services are set forth in Sec. 414.46.
    (ii) Radiology services. HCFA bases the RVUs for all radiology 
services on the relative value scale developed under section 
1834(b)(1)(A) of the Act, with appropriate modifications to ensure that 
the RVUs established for radiology services that are similar or related 
to other physician services are consistent with the RVUs established for 
those similar or related services.
    (b) Practice expense RVUs. (1) Practice expense RVUs are computed 
for each service or class of service by applying

[[Page 463]]

average historical practice cost percentages to the estimated average 
allowed charge during the 1991 base period.
    (2) The average practice expense percentage for a service or class 
of services is computed as follows:
    (i) Multiply the average practice expense percentage for each 
specialty by the proportion of a particular service or class of service 
performed by that specialty.
    (ii) Add the products for all specialties.
    (3) For services furnished beginning calendar year (CY) 1994, for 
which 1994 practice expense RVUs exceed 1994 work RVUs and that are 
performed in office settings less than 75 percent of the time, the 1994, 
1995, and 1996 practice expense RVUs are reduced by 25 percent of the 
amount by which they exceed the number of 1994 work RVUs. Practice 
expense RVUs are not reduced to less than 128 percent of 1994 work RVUs.
    (c) Malpractice insurance RVUs. (1) Malpractice insurance RVUs are 
computed for each service or class of services by applying average 
malpractice insurance historical practice cost percentages to the 
estimated average allowed charge during the 1991 base period.
    (2) The average historical malpractice insurance percentage for a 
service or class of services is computed as follows:
    (i) Multiply the average malpractice insurance percentage for each

Sec. 414.24  Review, revision, and addition of RVUs for physician services.

    (a) Interim values for new and revised HCPCS level 1 and level 2 
codes. (1) HCFA establishes interim RVUs for new services and for codes 
for which definitions have changed.
    (2) HCFA publishes a notice in the Federal Register to announce 
interim RVUs and seek public comment on them. The RVUs are effective 
prospectively for services furnished beginning on the effective date 
specified in the notice.
    (3) After considering public comments, HCFA revises, if necessary, 
the interim RVUs and announces those revisions in a final notice 
published in the Federal Register. Any revisions in the RVUs are 
effective prospectively for services furnished beginning on the 
effective date specified in the final notice.
    (b) Revision of RVUs for established HCPCS level 1 and level 2 
codes. (1) HCFA publishes a proposed notice in the Federal Register to 
announce changes in RVUs for established codes and provides an 
opportunity for public comment no less often than every 5 years.
    (2) After considering public comments, HCFA publishes a final notice 
in the Federal Register to announce revisions to RVUs.
    (3) The RVU revisions are effective prospectively for services 
furnished beginning on the effective date specified in the final notice.
    (c) Values for local codes (HCPCS Level 3). (1) Carriers establish 
relative values for local codes for services not included in HCPCS 
levels 1 or 2.
    (2) Carriers must obtain prior approval from HCFA to establish local 
codes for services that meet the definition of ``physician services'' in 
Sec. 414.2.

Sec. 414.26  Determining the GAF.

    HCFA establishes a GAF for each service in each fee schedule area.
    (a) Geographic indices. HCFA uses the following indices to establish 
the GAF:
    (1) An index that reflects one-fourth of the difference between the 
relative value of physicians' work effort in each of the different fee 
schedule areas as determined under Sec. 414.22(a) and the national 
average of that work effort.
    (2) An index that reflects the relative costs of the mix of goods 
and services comprising practice expenses (other than malpractice 
expenses) in each of the different fee schedule areas as determined 
under Sec. 414.22(b) compared to the national average of those costs.

[[Page 464]]

    (3) An index that reflects the relative costs of malpractice 
expenses in each of the different fee schedule areas as determined under 
Sec. 414.22(c) compared to the national average of those costs.
    (b) Class-specific practice cost indices. If the application of a 
single index to different classes of services would be substantially 
inequitable because of differences in the mix of goods and services 
comprising practice expenses for the different classes of services, more 
than one index may be established under paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section.
    (c) Computation of GAF. The GAF for each fee schedule area is the 
sum of the physicians' work adjustment factor, the practice expense 
adjustment factor, and the malpractice cost adjustment factor, as 
defined in this section:
    (1) The geographic physicians' work adjustment factor for a service 
is the product of the proportion of the total relative value for the 
service that reflects the RVUs for the work component and the geographic 
physicians' work index value established under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section.
    (2) The geographic practice expense adjustment factor for a service 
is the product of the proportion of the total relative value for the 
service that reflects the RVUs for the practice expense component, 
multiplied by the geographic practice cost index (GPCI) value 
established under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (3) The geographic malpractice adjustment factor for a service is 
the product of the proportion of the total relative value for the 
service that reflects the RVUs for the malpractice component, multiplied 
by the GPCI value established under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

Sec. 414.28  Conversion factors.

    HCFA establishes CFs in accordance with section 1848(d) of the Act.
    (a) Base-year CFs. HCFA established the CF for 1992 so that had 
section 1848 of the Act applied during 1991, it would have resulted in 
the same aggregate amount of payments for physician services as the 
estimated aggregate amount of these payments in 1991, adjusted by the 
update for 1992 computed as specified in Sec. 414.30.
    (b) Subsequent CFs. For calendar years 1993 through 1995, the CF for 
each year is equal to the CF for the previous year, adjusted in 
accordance with Sec. 414.30. Beginning January 1, 1996, the CF for each 
calendar year may be further adjusted so that adjustments to the fee 
schedule in accordance with section 1848(c)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act do not 
cause total expenditures under the fee schedule to differ by more than 
$20 million from the amount that would have been spent if these 
adjustments had not been made.

Sec. 414.30  Conversion factor update.

    Unless Congress acts in accordance with section 1848(d)(3) of the 
Act--
    (a) General rule. The CF update for a CY equals the Medicare 
Economic Index increased or decreased by the number of percentage points 
by which the percentage increase in expenditures for physician services 
(or for a particular category of physician services, such as surgical 
services) in the second preceding FY over the third preceding FY exceeds 
the performance standard rate of increase established for the second 
preceding FY.
    (b) Downward adjustment. The downward adjustment may not exceed the 
following:
    (1) For CYs 1992 and 1993, 2 percentage points.
    (2) For CY 1994, 2.5 percentage points.
    (3) For CYs 1995 and thereafter, 5 percentage points.

furnished in physician offices are furnished in facility settings, the 
fee schedule amount for those services is determined by reducing the 
practice expense RVUs for the service by 50 percent.
    (c) Services covered by the reduction. HCFA establishes a list of 
services routinely furnished in physicians' offices nationally. Services 
furnished at least 50 percent of the time in physicians' offices are 
subject to this reduction.
    (d) Services excluded from the reduction. The reduction established 
under this section does not apply to the following:
    (1) Rural health clinic services.
    (2) Surgical services not on the ambulatory surgical center covered 
list of procedures published under Sec. 416.65(c) of this chapter when 
furnished in an ambulatory surgical center.
    (3) Anesthesiology services and diagnostic and therapeutic radiology 
services.

Sec. 414.34  Payment for services and supplies incident to a physician's service.

    (a) Medical supplies. (1) Except as otherwise specified in this 
paragraph, office medical supplies are considered to be part of a 
physician's practice expense, and payment for them is included in the 
practice expense portion of the payment to the physician for the medical 
or surgical service to which they are incidental.
    (2) If physician services of the type routinely furnished in 
provider settings are furnished in a physician's office, separate 
payment may be made for certain supplies furnished incident to that 
physician service if the following requirements are met:
    (i) It is a procedure that can safely be furnished in the office 
setting in appropriate circumstances.
    (ii) It requires specialized supplies that are not routinely 
available in physicians' offices and that are generally disposable.
    (3) For the purpose of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, provider 
settings include only the following settings:
    (i) Hospital inpatient and outpatient departments.
    (ii) Ambulatory surgical centers.
    (4) For the purpose of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, ``routinely 
furnished in provider settings'' means furnished in inpatient or 
outpatient hospital settings or ambulatory surgical centers more than 50 
percent of the time.
    (5) HCFA establishes a list of services for which a separate supply 
payment may be made under this section.
    (6) The fee schedule amount for supplies billed separately is not 
subject to a GPCI adjustment.
    (b) Services of nonphysicians that are incident to a physician's 
service. Services of nonphysicians that are covered as incident to a 
physician's service are paid as if the physician had personally 
furnished the service.


<R05>
Sec. 414.36  Payment for drugs incident to a physician's service.

    Payment for drugs incident to a physician's service is made in

Sec. 414.38  Special rules for payment of low osmolar contrast media.

    (a) General. Payment for low osmolar contrast media is included in 
the technical component payment for diagnostic procedures except as 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Conditions for separate payment. For diagnostic procedures 
furnished to beneficiaries who are neither inpatients nor outpatients of 
any hospital, separate payment is made for low osmolar contrast media 
used in all intrathecal injections and in intravenous, and intra-
arterial injections, if it is used for patients with one or more of the 
following characteristics:
    (1) A history of a previous adverse reaction to contrast material, 
with the exception of a sensation of heat, flushing, or a single episode 
of nausea or vomiting.
    (2) A history of asthma or allergy.
    (3) Significant cardiac dysfunction including recent or imminent 
cardiac decompensation, severe arrhythmias,

[[Page 466]]

unstable angina pectoris, recent myocardial infarction, and pulmonary 
hypertension.
    (4) Generalized severe debilitation.
    (5) Sickle cell disease.
    (c) Method of payment. If one of the conditions of paragraph (b) of 
this section is met, payment is made for low osmolar contrast media as 
set forth in Sec. 414.36 as a drug furnished incident to a physician's 
service, subject to paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) Drug payment reduction. If separate payment is made for low 
osmolar contrast media, the payment amount calculated in accordance with 
Sec. 414.36 is reduced by 8 percent to account for the allowance for 
contrast media already included in the technical component of the 
diagnostic procedure code.

Sec. 414.39  Special rules for payment of care plan oversight.

    (a) General. Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, 
payment for care plan oversight is included in the payment for visits 
and other services under the physician fee schedule.
    (b) Exception. Separate payment is made under the following 
conditions for physician care plan oversight services furnished to 
beneficiaries who receive HHA and hospice services that are covered by 
Medicare:
    (1) The care plan oversight services require recurrent physician 
supervision of therapy involving 30 or more minutes of the physician's 
time per month.
    (2) Payment is made to only one physician per patient for services 
furnished during a calendar month period. The physician must have 
furnished a service requiring a face-to-face encounter with the patient 
at least once during the 6-month period before the month for which care 
plan oversight payment is first billed. The physician may not have a 
significant ownership interest in, or financial or contractual 
relationship with, the HHA in accordance with Sec. 424.22(d) of this 
chapter. The physician may not be the medical director or employee of 
the hospice and may not furnish services under an arrangement with the 
hospice.
    (3) If a physician furnishes care plan oversight services during a 
postoperative period, payment for care plan oversight services is made 
if the services are documented in the patient's medical record as 
unrelated to the surgery.

Sec. 414.40  Coding and ancillary policies.

    (a) General rule. HCFA establishes uniform national definitions of 
services, codes to represent services, and payment modifiers to the 
codes.
    (b) Specific types of policies. HCFA establishes uniform national 
ancillary policies necessary to implement the fee schedule for physician 
services. These include, but are not limited to, the following policies:
    (1) Global surgery policy (for example, post- and pre-operative 
periods and services, and intra-operative services).
    (2) Professional and technical components (for example, payment for 
services, such as an EEG, which typically comprise a technical component 
(the taking of the test) and a professional component (the

surgery, bilateral surgery, split surgical global services, team 
surgery, and unusual services).


<R05>
Sec. 414.42  Adjustment for first 4 years of practice.

    (a) General rule. For services furnished during CYs 1992 and 1993, 
except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the fee schedule 
payment amount or prevailing charge must be phased in as specified in 
paragraph (d) of this section for physicians, physical therapists (PTs), 
occupational therapists (OTs), and all other health care practitioners 
who are in their first through fourth years of practice.
    (b) Exception. The reduction required in paragraph (d) of this 
section does not apply to primary care services or to services furnished 
in a rural area as defined in section 1886(d)(2)(D) of the Act that is 
designated under section 332(a)(1)(A) of the Public Health Service Act 
as a Health Professional Shortage Area.
    (c) Definition of years of practice. (1) The ``first year of 
practice`` is the first full CY during the first 6 months of

[[Page 467]]

which the physician, PT, OT, or other health care practitioner furnishes 
professional services for which payment may be made under Medicare Part 
B, plus any portion of the prior CY if that prior year does not meet the 
first 6 months test.
    (2) The ``second, third, and fourth years of practice`` are the 
first, second, and third CYs following the first year of practice, 
respectively.
    (d) Amounts of adjustment. The fee schedule payment for the service 
of a new physician, PT, OT, or other health care practitioner is limited 
to the following percentages for each of the indicated years:
    (1) First year--80 percent
    (2) Second year--85 percent

<R05>
Sec. 414.44  Transition rules.

    (a) Adjusted historical payment basis--(1) All services other than 
radiology and nuclear medicine services. For all physician services 
other than radiology services, furnished in a fee schedule area, the 
adjusted historical payment basis (AHPB) is the estimated weighted 
average prevailing charge applied in the fee schedule area for the 
service in CY 1991, as determined by HCFA without regard to physician 
specialty and as adjusted to reflect payments for services below the 
prevailing charge, adjusted by the update established for CY 1992.
    (2) Radiology services. For radiology services, the AHPB is the 
amount paid for the service in the fee schedule area in CY 1991 under 
the fee schedule established under section 1834(b), adjusted by the 
update established for CY 1992.
    (3) Nuclear medicine services. For nuclear medicine services, the 
AHPB is the amount paid for the service in the fee schedule area in CY 
1991 under the fee schedule established under section 6105(b) of Public 
Law 101-239 and section 4102(g) of Public Law 101-508, adjusted by the 
update established for CY 1992.
    (4) Transition adjustment. HCFA adjusts the AHPB for all services by 
5.5 percent to produce budget-neutral payments for 1992.
    (b) Adjustment of 1992 payments for physician services other than 
radiology services. For physician services furnished during CY 1992 the 
following rules apply:
    (1) If the AHPB determined under paragraph (a) of this section is 
from 85 percent to 115 percent of the fee schedule amount for the area 
for services furnished in 1992, payment is at the fee schedule amount.
    (2) If the AHPB determined under paragraph (a) of this section is 
less than 85 percent of the fee schedule amount for the area for 
services furnished in 1992, an amount equal to the AHPB plus 15 percent 
of the fee schedule amount is substituted for the fee schedule amount.
    (3) If the AHPB determined under paragraph (a) of this section is 
greater than 115 percent of the fee schedule amount for the area for 
services furnished in 1992, an amount equal to the AHPB minus 15 percent 
of the fee schedule amount is substituted for the fee schedule amount.
    (c) Adjustment of 1992 payments for radiology services. For 
radiology services furnished during CY 1992 the following rules apply:
    (1) If the AHPB determined under paragraph (a) of this section is 
from 85 percent to 109 percent of the fee schedule amount for the area 
for services furnished in 1992, payment is at the fee schedule amount.
    (2) If the AHPB determined under paragraph (a) of this section is 
less than 85 percent of the fee schedule amount for the area for 
services furnished in 1992, an amount equal to the AHPB plus 15 percent 
of the fee schedule amount is substituted for the fee schedule amount.
    (3) If the AHPB determined under paragraph (a) of this section is 
greater than 109 percent of the fee schedule amount for the area for 
services furnished in 1992, an amount equal to the AHPB minus 9 percent 
of the fee schedule amount is substituted for the fee schedule amount.
    (d) Computation of payments for CY 1993. For physician services 
subject to the transition rules in CY 1992 and furnished during CY 1993, 
the fee schedule is equal to 75 percent of the amount that would have 
been paid in the fee

[[Page 468]]

schedule area under the 1992 transition rules, adjusted by the amount of 
the 1993 update, plus 25 percent of the 1993 fee schedule amount.
    (e) Computation of payments for CY 1994. For physician services 
subject to the transition rules in CY 1993, and furnished during CY 
1994, the fee schedule is equal to 67 percent of the amount that would 
have been paid in the fee schedule area under the 1993 transition rules, 
adjusted by the amount of the 1994 update, plus 33 percent of the 1994 
fee schedule amount.
    (f) Computation of payments for CY 1995. For physician services 
subject to the transition rules in CY 1994 and furnished during CY 1995, 
the fee schedule is equal to 50 percent of the amount that would have 
been paid in the fee schedule area under the 1994 transition rules, 
adjusted by the amount of the 1995 update, plus 50 percent of the 1995 
fee schedule amount.


<R05>
Sec. 414.46  Additional rules for payment of anesthesia services.

    (a) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following 
definitions apply:
    (1) Base unit means the value for each anesthesia code that reflects 
all activities other than anesthesia time. These activities include 
usual pre-operative and post-operative visits, the administration of 
fluids and/or blood incident to anesthesia care, and monitoring 
services.
    (2) Time units involve the continuous actual presence of the 
physician (or of the medically directed qualified anesthetist or 
resident) and start when he or she begins to prepare the patient for 
anesthesia care and ends when the anesthesiologist (or medically 
directed CRNA) is no longer in personal attendance, that is, when the 
patient may be safely placed under post-operative care.
    (b) Determination of payment amount--Basic rule. For anesthesia 
services performed, medically directed, or medically supervised by a 
physician, HCFA pays the lesser of the actual charge or the anesthesia 
fee schedule amount.
    (1) The physician fee schedule amount for an anesthesia service is 
based on the product of the allowable base and time units and an 
anesthesia-specific CF.
    (2) The allowable base units are determined by the uniform relative 
value guide based on the 1988 American Society of Anesthesiologists' 
Relative Value Guide except that the number of base units recognized for 
anesthesia services furnished during cataract or iridectomy surgery is 
four units. The uniform base units are identified in program operating 
instructions.
    (3) Modifier units are not allowed. Modifier units include 
additional units charged by a physician or a CRNA for patient health 
status, risk, age, or unusual circumstances.
    (c) Physician personally performs the anesthesia procedure.
    (1) HCFA considers an anesthesia service to be personally performed 
under any of the following circumstances:
    (i) The physician performs the entire anesthesia service alone.
    (ii) The physician establishes an attending physician relationship 
in one or two concurrent cases involving an intern or resident and the 
service was furnished before January 1, 1994.
    (iii) The physician establishes an attending physician relationship 
in one case involving an intern or resident and the service was 
furnished on or after January 1, 1994 but prior to January 1, 1996. For 
services on or after January 1, 1996, the physician must be the teaching 
physician as defined in Secs. 415.170 through 415.184 of this chapter.
    (iv) The physician and the CRNA or AA are involved in a single case 
and the services of each are found to be medically necessary.
    (v) The physician is continuously involved in a single case 
involving a student nurse anesthetist.
    (vi) The physician is continuously involved in a single case 
involving a CRNA or AA and the service was furnished prior to January 1, 
1998.
    (2) HCFA determines the fee schedule amount for an anesthesia 
service personally performed by a physician on the basis of an 
anesthesia-specific fee schedule CF and unreduced base units and 
anesthesia time units. One anesthesia time unit is equivalent to 15

[[Page 469]]

minutes of anesthesia time, and fractions of a 15-minute period are 
recognized as fractions of an anesthesia time unit.
    (d) Anesthesia services medically directed by a physician. (1) HCFA 
considers an anesthesia service to be medically directed by a physician 
if:
    (i) The physician performs the activities described in Sec. 415.110 
of this chapter.
    (ii) The physician directs qualified individuals involved in two, 
three, or four concurrent cases.
    (iii) Medical direction can occur for a single case furnished on or 
after January 1, 1998 if the physician performs the activities described 
in Sec. 415.110 of this chapter and medically directs a single CRNA or 
AA.
    (2) The rules for medical direction differ for certain time periods 
depending on the nature of the qualified individual who is directed by 
the physician. If more than two procedures are directed on or after 
January 1, 1994, the qualified individuals could be AAs, CRNAs, interns, 
or residents. The medical direction rules apply to student nurse 
anesthetists only if the physician directs two concurrent cases, each of 
which involves a student nurse anesthetist or the physician directs one 
case involving a student nurse anesthetist and the other involving a 
CRNA, AA, intern, or resident.
    (3) Payment for medical direction is based on a specific percentage 
of the payment allowance recognized for the anesthesia service 
personally performed by a physician alone. The following percentages 
apply for the years specified:
    (i) CY 1994--60 percent of the payment allowance for personally 
performed procedures.
    (ii) CY 1995--57.5 percent of the payment allowance for personally 
performed services.
    (iii) CY 1996--55 percent of the payment allowance for personally 
performed services.
    (iv) CY 1997--52.5 percent of the payment allowance for personally 
performed services.
    (v) CY 1998 and thereafter--50 percent of the payment allowance for 
personally performed services.
    (e) Physician medically supervises anesthesia services. If the 
physician medically supervises more than four concurrent anesthesia 
services, HCFA bases the fee schedule amount on an anesthesia-specific 
CF and three base units. This represents payment for the physician's 
involvement in the pre-surgical anesthesia services.
    (f) Payment for medical or surgical services furnished by a 
physician while furnishing anesthesia services. (1) HCFA allows separate 
payment under the fee schedule for certain reasonable and medically 
necessary medical or surgical services furnished by a physician while 
furnishing anesthesia services to the patient. HCFA makes payment for 
these services in accordance with the general physician fee schedule 
rules in Sec. 414.20. These services are described in program operating 
instructions.
    (2) HCFA makes no separate payment for other medical or surgical 
services, such as the pre-anesthetic examination of the patient, pre- or 
post-operative visits, or usual monitoring functions, that are 
ordinarily included in the anesthesia service.
    (g) Physician involved in multiple anesthesia services. If the 
physician is involved in multiple anesthesia services for the same 
patient during the same operative session, the carrier makes payment 
according to the base unit associated with the anesthesia service having 
the highest base unit value and anesthesia time that encompasses the 
multiple services.

    (b) Specific limits. For items or services paid under the physician 
fee schedule, the limiting charge is 115 percent of the fee schedule 
amount for nonparticipating suppliers. For items or services HCFA 
excludes from payment under the physician fee schedule (in accordance 
with section 1848 (j)(3) of the

[[Page 470]]

Act), the limiting charge is 115 percent of 95 percent of the payment 
basis applicable to participating suppliers.

Sec. 414.60  Payment for the services of CRNAs.

    (a) Basis for payment. Beginning with CY 1994--
    (1) The allowance for an anesthesia service furnished by a medically 
directed CRNA is based on a fixed percentage of the allowance recognized 
for the anesthesia service personally performed by the physician alone, 
as specified in Sec. 414.46(d)(3); and
    (2) The CF for an anesthesia service furnished by a CRNA not 
directed by a physician may not exceed the CF for a service personally 
performed by a physician.
    (b) To whom payment may be made. Payment for an anesthesia service 
furnished by a CRNA may be made to the CRNA or to any individual or 
entity (such as a hospital, critical access hospital, physician, group 
practice, or ambulatory surgical center) with which the CRNA has an 
employment or contract relationship that provides for payment to be made 
to the individual or entity.
    (c) Condition for payment. Payment for the services of a CRNA may be 
made only on an assignment related basis, and any assignment accepted by 
a CRNA is binding on any other person presenting a claim or request for 
payment for the service.

Sec. 414.210  General payment rules.

    (a) General rule. For items furnished on or after January 1, 1989, 
except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, Medicare 
pays for durable medical equipment, prosthetics and

[[Page 472]]

orthotics, including a separate payment for maintenance and servicing of 
the items as described in paragraph (e) of this section, on the basis of 
80 percent of the lesser of--
    (1) The actual charge for the item;
    (2) The fee schedule amount for the item, as determined in 
accordance with the provisions of Secs. 414.220 through 414.232.

services or items free-of-charge or at nominal prices to a significant 
number of low-income patients, as defined in Sec. 413.13(a) of this 
chapter, are paid on the basis of 80 percent of the fee schedule amount 
determined in accordance with the provision of Secs. 414.220 through 
414.230.
    (d) Prohibition on special limits. For items furnished on or after 
January 1, 1989 and before January 1, 1991, neither HCFA nor a carrier 
may establish a special reasonable charge for items covered under this 
subpart on the basis of inherent reasonableness as described in 
Sec. 405.502(g) of this chapter.
    (e) Maintenance and servicing. (1) General rule. Except as provided 
in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the carrier pays the reasonable and 
necessary charges for maintenance and servicing of purchased equipment. 
Reasonable and necessary charges are those made for parts and labor not 
otherwise covered under a manufacturer's or supplier's warranty. Payment 
is made, as needed, in a lump sum based on the carrier's consideration 
of the item. Payment is not made for maintenance and servicing of a 
rented item other than the maintenance and servicing fee for other 
durable medical equipment, as described in Sec. 414.229(e).
    (2) Exception. For items purchased on or after June 1, 1989, no 
payment is made under the provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section 
for the maintenance and servicing of:
    (i) Items requiring frequent and substantial servicing, as defined 
in Sec. 414.222(a);
    (ii) Capped rental items, as defined in Sec. 414.229(a), that are

    (iii) Oxygen equipment, as defined in Sec. 414.226.
    (f) Replacement of equipment. Except as provided in Sec. 414.229(g), 
if a purchased item of DME or a prosthetic or orthotic device paid for 
under this subpart has been in continuous use by the patient for the 
equipment's reasonable useful lifetime or if the carrier determines that 
the item is lost or irreparably damaged, the patient may elect to obtain 
a new piece of equipment.
    (1) The reasonable useful lifetime of DME or prosthetic and orthotic 
devices is determined through program instructions. In the absence of 
program instructions, carriers may determine the reasonable useful 
lifetime of equipment but in no case can it be less than 5 years. 
Computation is based on when the equipment is delivered to the 
beneficiary, not the age of the equipment.
    (2) If the beneficiary elects to obtain replacement equipment, 
payment is made on a purchase basis.

Sec. 414.220  Inexpensive or routinely purchased items.

    (a) Definitions. (1) Inexpensive equipment means equipment the 
average purchase price of which did not exceed $150 during the period 
July 1986 through June 1987.
    (2) Routinely purchased equipment means equipment that was acquired 
by purchase on a national basis at least 75 percent of the time during 
the period July 1986 through June 1987.

[[Page 473]]

    (3) Accessories. Effective January 1, 1994, accessories used in 
conjunction with a nebulizer, aspirator, or ventilator excluded from 
Sec. 414.222 meet the definitions of ``inexpensive equipment'' and 
``routinely purchased equipment'' in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of 
this section, respectively.
    (b) Payment rules. (1) Subject to the limitation in paragraph (b)(3) 
of this section, payment for inexpensive and routinely purchased items 
is made on a rental basis or in a lump sum amount for purchase of the 
item based on the applicable fee schedule amount.
    (2) Effective January 1, 1994, payment for ostomy supplies, 
tracheostomy supplies, urologicals, and surgical dressings not furnished 
as incident to a physician's professional service or furnished by an HHA 
is made using the methodology for the inexpensive and routinely 
purchased class.
    (3) The total amount of payments made for an item may not exceed the 
fee schedule amount recognized for the purchase of that item.
    (c) Fee schedule amount for 1989 and 1990. The fee schedule amount 
for payment of purchase or rental of inexpensive or routinely purchased 
items furnished in 1989 and 1990 is the local payment amount determined 
as follows:
    (1) The carrier determines the average reasonable charge for 
inexpensive or routinely purchased items that were furnished during the 
period July 1, 1986 through June 30, 1987 based on the mean of the 
carrier's allowed charges for the item. A separate determination of an 
average reasonable charge is made for rental equipment, new purchased 
equipment, and used purchased equipment.
    (2) The carrier adjusts the amount determined under paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section by the change in the level of the CPI-U for the 6-month 
period ending December 1987.
    (d) Updating the local payment amounts for years after 1990. For 
each year subsequent to 1990, the local payment amounts of the preceding 
year are increased or decreased by the covered item update. For 1991 and 
1992, the covered item update is reduced by 1 percentage point.
    (e) Calculating the fee schedule amounts for years after 1990. For 
years after 1990, the fee schedule amounts are equal to the national 
limited payment amount.
    (f) Calculating the national limited payment amount. The national 
limited payment amount is computed as follows:
    (1) The 1991 national limited payment amount is equal to:
    (i) 100 percent of the local payment amount if the local payment 
amount is neither greater than the weighted average nor less than 85 
percent of the weighted average of all local payment amounts;
    (ii) The sum of 67 percent of the local payment amount plus 33 
percent of the weighted average of all local payment amounts if the 
local payment amount exceeds the weighted average of all local payment 
amounts; or
    (iii) The sum of 67 percent of the local payment amount plus 33 
percent of 85 percent of the weighted average of all local payment 
amounts if the local payment amount is less than 85 percent of the 
weighted average of all local payment amounts.
    (2) The 1992 national limited payment amount is equal to:
    (i) 100 percent of the local payment amount if the local payment 
amount is neither greater than the weighted average nor less than 85 
percent of the weighted average of all local payment amounts;
    (ii) The sum of 33 percent of the local payment amount plus 67 
percent of the weighted average of all local payment amounts if the 
local payment amount exceeds the weighted average; or
    (iii) The sum of 33 percent of the local payment amount plus 67 
percent of 85 percent of the weighted average of all local payment 
amounts if the local payment amount is less than 85 percent of the 
weighted average.
    (3) For 1993, the national limited payment amount is equal to one of 
the following:
    (i) 100 percent of the local payment amount if the local payment 
amount is neither greater than the weighted average nor less than 85 
percent of the weighted average of all local payment amounts.
    (ii) 100 percent of the weighted average of all local payment 
amounts if the local payment amount exceeds the

[[Page 474]]

weighted average of all local payment amounts.
    (iii) 85 percent of the weighted average of all local payment 
amounts if the local payment amount is less than 85 percent of the 
weighted average of all local payment amounts.
    (4) For 1994 and subsequent years, the national limited payment 
amount is equal to one of the following:
    (i) If the local payment amount is not in excess of the median, nor 
less than 85 percent of the median, of all local payment amounts--100 
percent of the local payment amount.
    (ii) If the local payment amount exceeds the median--100 percent of 
the median of all local payment amounts.
    (iii) If the local payment amount is less than 85 percent of the 
median--85 percent of the median of all local payment amounts.
    (g) Payment for surgical dressings. For surgical dressings furnished 
after December 31, 1993, the national limited payment amount is computed 
based on local payment amounts using average reasonable charges for the 
12-month period ending December 31, 1992, increased by the covered item 
updates for 1993 and 1994.

Sec. 414.222  Items requiring frequent and substantial servicing.

    (a) Definition. Items requiring frequent and substantial servicing 
in order to avoid risk to the beneficiary's health are the following:
    (1) Ventilators (except those that are either continuous airway 
pressure devices or intermittent assist devices with continuous airway 
pressure devices).
    (2) Continuous and intermittent positive pressure breathing 
machines.
    (3) Continuous passive motion machines.
    (4) Other items specified in HCFA program instructions.
    (5) Other items identified by the carrier.
    (b) Payment rule. Rental payments for items requiring frequent and 
substantial servicing are made on a monthly basis, and continue until 
medical necessity ends.
    (c) Fee schedule amount for 1989 and 1990. The fee schedule amount 
for items requiring frequent and substantial servicing is the local 
payment amount determined as follows:
    (1) The carrier determines the average reasonable charge for rental 
of items requiring frequent and substantial servicing that were 
furnished during the period July 1, 1986 through June 30, 1987 based on 
the mean of the carrier's allowed charges for the item.
    (2) The carrier adjusts the amounts determined under paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section by the change in the level of the CPI-U for the 
6-month period ending December 1987.
    (d) Updating the fee schedule amounts for years after 1990. For 
years after 1990, the fee schedules are determined using the methodology 
contained in paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of Sec. 414.220.
    (e) Transition to other payment classes. For purposes of calculating 
the 15-month rental period, beginning January 1, 1994, if an item has 
been paid for under the frequent and substantial servicing class and is 
subsequently paid for under another payment class, the rental period 
begins with the first month of continuous rental, even if that period 
began before January 1, 1994. For example, if the rental period began on 
July 1, 1993, the carrier must use this date as beginning the first 
month of rental. Likewise, for purposes of calculating the 10-month 
purchase option, the rental period begins with the first month of 
continuous rental without regard to when that period started. For 
example, if the rental period began in August 1993, the 10-month 
purchase option must be offered to the beneficiary in May 1994, the 
tenth month of continuous rental.

Sec. 414.224  Customized items.

    (a) Criteria for a customized item. To be considered a customized 
item for payment purposes under paragraph (b) of this section, a covered 
item (including a wheelchair) must be uniquely constructed or 
substantially modified for a specific beneficiary according to the 
description and orders of a physician and be so different from another 
item used for the same purpose that the two

[[Page 475]]

items cannot be grouped together for pricing purposes.
    (b) Payment rule. Payment is made on a lump sum basis for the 
purchase of a customized item based on the carrier's individual 
consideration and judgment of a reasonable payment amount for each 
customized item. The carrier's individual consideration takes into 
account written documentation on the costs of the item including at 
least the cost of labor and materials used in customizing an item.

to 0.95 times the base local average monthly payment amount adjusted by 
the change in the CPI-U for the six-month period ending December 1987.
    (3) For years after 1990, the fee schedule amounts are determined 
using the methodology contained in Sec. 414.220 (d), (e), and (f).
    (c) Application of monthly fee schedule amounts. (1) The fee 
schedule amount for items described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section is paid when the beneficiary rents a stationary oxygen system.
    (2) Subject to the limitation set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this

(b)(1)(iii) of this section is paid when the beneficiary owns a 
stationary gaseous or liquid oxygen system.
    (4) The fee schedule amount for items described in paragraph 
(b)(1)(iv) of this section is paid when the beneficiary owns or rents a 
portable gaseous or portable liquid oxygen system and uses either a 
stationary oxygen concentrator or no stationary oxygen system.
    (d) Volume adjustments: (1) The fee schedule amount for an item 
described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is adjusted as follows:
    (i) If the attending physician prescribes an oxygen flow rate 
exceeding four liters per minute, the fee schedule amount is increased 
by 50 percent, subject to the limit in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (ii) If the attending physician prescribes an oxygen flow rate of 
less than one liter per minute, the fee schedule amount is decreased by 
50 percent.
    (2) If portable oxygen equipment is used and the prescribed oxygen 
flow rate exceeds four liters per minute, the total fee schedule amount 
recognized for payment is limited to the higher of--
    (i) The sum of the monthly fee schedule amount for the items 
described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section; or
    (ii) The adjusted fee schedule amount described in paragraph 
(d)(1)(i) of this section.

[[Page 476]]

    (3) In establishing the volume adjustment for those beneficiaries 
whose physicians prescribe varying flow rates, the following rules 
apply:
    (i) If the prescribed flow rate is different for stationary oxygen 
equipment than for portable oxygen equipment, the flow rate for the 
stationary equipment is used.
    (ii) If the prescribed flow rate is different for the patient at 
rest than for the patient at exercise, the flow rate for the patient at 
rest is used.
    (iii) If the prescribed flow rate is different for nighttime use and 
daytime use, the average of the two flow rates is used.

average purchase price equal to the unweighted average of the purchase 
prices determined under paragraph (b)(4) of this section for all 
carriers.
    (6) HCFA determines the fee schedule amount equal to 100 percent of 
the purchase price determined under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, 
subject to the following limitations:
    (i) For 1992, the amount cannot be greater than 125 percent nor less 
than 85 percent of the national average purchase price determined under 
paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
    (ii) For 1993 and subsequent years, the amount cannot be greater 
than 120 percent of the national average nor less than 90 percent of the 
national average purchase price determined under paragraph (b)(5) of 
this section.

Sec. 414.229  Other durable medical equipment--capped rental items.

    (a) General payment rule. Subject to the limitation set forth in 
paragraph (b) of this section, payment is made on a rental or purchase 
option basis for other durable medical equipment that is not subject to 
the payment provisions set forth in Secs. 414.220 through 414.228.

[[Page 477]]

    (b) Fee schedule amounts for rental. (1) For 1989 and 1990, the 
monthly fee schedule amount for rental of other covered durable medical 
equipment equals 10 percent of the purchase price recognized as 
determined under paragraph (c) of this section subject to the following 
limitation: For 1989 and 1990, the fee schedule amount cannot be greater 
than 115 percent nor less than 85 percent of the prevailing charge, as 
determined under Sec. 405.504 of this chapter, established for rental of 
the item in January 1987, as adjusted by the change in the level of the 
CPI-U for the 6-month period ending December 1987.
    (2) For 1991 and subsequent years, the monthly fee schedule amount 
for rental of other covered durable medical equipment equals 10 percent 
of the purchase price recognized as determined under paragraph (c) of 
this section for each of the first 3 months and 7.5 percent of the 
purchase price for each of the remaining months.
    (c) Determination of purchase price. The purchase price of other 
covered durable medical equipment is determined as follows:
    (1) For 1989 and 1990. (i) The carrier determines a base local 
purchase price amount equal to the average of the purchase prices 
submitted on an assignment-related basis of new items supplied during 
the 6-month period ending December 1986.
    (ii) The purchase price is equal to the base local purchase price 
adjusted by the change in the level of the CPI-U for the 6-month period 
ending December 1987.
    (2) For 1991. (i) The local payment amount is the purchase price for 
the preceding year adjusted by the covered item update for 1991 and 
decreased by the percentage by which the average of the reasonable 
charges for claims paid for all other items described in Sec. 414.229, 
is lower than the average of the purchase prices submitted for such 
items during the final 9 months of 1988.
    (ii) The purchase price for 1991 is the national limited payment 
amount as determined using the methodology contained in Sec. 414.220(f).
    (3) For years after 1991. The purchase price is determined using the 
methodology contained in paragraphs (d) through (f) of Sec. 414.220.
    (d) Purchase option. Suppliers must offer a purchase option to 
beneficiaries during the 10th continuous rental month and, for power-
driven wheelchairs, the purchase option must also be made available at 
the time the equipment is initially furnished.
    (1) Suppliers must offer beneficiaries the option of purchasing 
power-driven wheelchairs at the time the supplier first furnishes the 
item. Payment must be on a lump-sum fee schedule purchase basis if the 
beneficiary chooses the purchase option. The purchase fee is the amount 
established in Sec. 414.229(c).
    (2) Suppliers must offer beneficiaries the option of converting 
capped rental items (including power-driven wheelchairs not purchased 
when initially furnished) to purchased equipment during their 10th 
continuous rental month. Beneficiaries have one month from the date the 
supplier makes the offer to accept the purchase option.
    (i) If the beneficiary does not accept the purchase option, payment 
continues on a rental basis not to exceed a period of continuous use of 
longer than 15 months. After 15 months of rental payments have been 
paid, the supplier must continue to provide the item without charge, 
other than a charge for maintenance and servicing fees, until medical 
necessity ends or Medicare coverage ceases. A period of continuous use 
is determined under the provisions in Sec. 414.230.
    (ii) If the beneficiary accepts the purchase option, payment 
continues on a rental basis not to exceed a period of continuous use of 
longer than 13 months. On the first day after 13 continuous rental 
months during which payment is made, the supplier must transfer title to 
the equipment to the beneficiary.
    (e) Payment for maintenance and servicing. (1) The carrier 
establishes a reasonable fee for maintenance and servicing for each 
rented item of other durable medical equipment. The fee may not exceed 
10 percent of the purchase price recognized as determined under 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) Payment of the fee for maintenance and servicing of other 
durable medical equipment that is rented is made only for equipment that 
continues to be used after 15 months of rental

[[Page 478]]

payments have been made and is limited to the following:
    (i) For the first 6-month period, no payments are to be made.
    (ii) For each succeeding 6-month period, payment may be made during 
the first month of that period.
    (3) Payment for maintenance and servicing DME purchased in 
accordance with paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2)(ii) of this section, is 
made on the basis of reasonable and necessary charges.
    (f) Transition to the fee schedules. For purposes of computing the 
10-month or 15-month period of continuous use for other durable medical 
equipment, as described in Sec. 414.230, the carrier counts the first 
month that the beneficiary continuously rented the equipment without 
regard to whether that month occurred before January 1, 1989 or after. 
If a beneficiary's 15-month rental period ends prior to January 1, 1989, 
no further purchase or rental payments are to be made except for 
maintenance and servicing of equipment as described in paragraph (e) of 
this section.
    (g) Replacement of equipment. If the item of equipment has been in 
continuous use by the patient on either a rental or purchase basis for 
the equipment's useful lifetime, or if the carrier determines that the 
item is lost or irreparably damaged, the patient may elect to obtain a 
new piece of equipment.
    (1) The reasonable useful lifetime of DME or prosthetic and orthotic 
devices is determined through program instructions. In the absence of 
program instructions, carriers may determine the reasonable useful 
lifetime of equipment but in no case can it be less than 5 years. 
Computation is based on when the equipment is delivered to the 
beneficiary, not the age of the equipment.
    (2) If the beneficiary elects to obtain replacement equipment, 
payment is made on a rental or purchase basis in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section or on a lump-sum purchase basis if a 
purchase agreement had been entered into in accordance with paragraph 
(d) of this section.

Sec. 414.230  Determining a period of continuous use.

    (a) Scope. This section sets forth the rules that apply in 
determining a period of continuous use for rental of durable medical 
equipment.
    (b) Continuous use. A period of continuous use begins with the first 
month of medical need and lasts until a beneficiary's medical need for a 
particular item of durable medical equipment ends.
    (c) Temporary interruption. (1) A period of continuous use allows 
for temporary interruptions in the use of equipment.
    (2) An interruption of not longer than 60 consecutive days plus the 
days remaining in the rental month in which use ceases is temporary, 
regardless of the reason for the interruption.
    (3) Unless there is a break in medical necessity that lasts lnnger 
than 60 consecutive days plus the days remaining in the rental month in 
which use ceases, medical necessity is presumed to continue.
    (d) Criteria for a new rental period. If an interruption in the use 
of equipment continues for more than 60 consecutive days plus the days 
remaining in the rental month in which use ceases, a new rental period 
begins if the supplier submits all of the following information--
    (1) A new prescription.
    (2) New medical necessity documentation.
    (3) A statement describing the reason for the interruption and 
demonstrating that medical necessity in the prior episode ended.
    (e) Beneficiary moves. A permanent or temporary move made by a 
beneficiary does not constitute an interruption in the period of 
continuous use.
    (f) New equipment. If a beneficiary changes equipment or requires 
additional equipment based on a physician's prescription, and the new or 
additional equipment is found to be necessary, a new period of 
continuous use begins for the new or additional equipment. A new period 
of continuous use does not begin for base equipment that is modified by 
an addition.

[[Page 479]]

    (g) New supplier. If a beneficiary changes suppliers, a new period 
of continuous use does not begin.

Sec. 414.232  Special payment rules for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulators (TENS).

    (a) General payment rule. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of 
this section, payment for TENS is made on a purchase basis with the 
purchase price determined using the methodology for purchase of 
inexpensive or routinely purchased items as described in Sec. 414.220. 
The payment amount for TENS computed under Sec. 414.220(c)(2) is reduced 
according to the following formula:
    (1) Effective April 1, 1990--the original payment amount is reduced 
by 15 percent.
    (2) Effective January 1, 1991--the reduced payment amount in 
paragraph (a)(1) is reduced by 15 percent.
    (3) Effective January 1, 1994--the reduced payment amount in 
paragraph (a)(1) is reduced by 45 percent.
    (b) Exception. In order to permit an attending physician time to 
determine whether the purchase of the TENS is medically appropriate for 
a particular patient, two months of rental payments may be made in 
addition to the purchase price. The rental payments are equal to 10 
percent of the purchase price.

  Subpart E--Determination of Reasonable Charges Under the ESRD Program


<R05>
Sec. 414.300  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart sets forth criteria and procedures for payment of the 
following services furnished to ESRD patients:
    (a) Physician services related to renal dialysis.
    (b) Physician services related to renal transplantation.
    (c) Home dialysis equipment, supplies, and support services.
    (d) Epoetin (EPO) furnished by a supplier of home dialysis equipment 
and supplies to a home dialysis patient for use in the home.

[55 FR 23441, June 8, 1990, as amended at 56 FR 43710, Sept. 4, 1991; 59 
FR 1285, Jan. 10, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 414.310  Determination of reasonable charges for physician services furnished to renal dialysis patients.

    (a) Principle. Physician services furnished to renal dialysis 
patients are subject to payment if the services are otherwise covered by 
the Medicare program and if they are considered reasonable and medically 
necessary in accordance with section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Act.
    (b) Scope and applicability--(1) Scope. This section pertains to 
physician services furnished to the following patients:
    (i) Outpatient maintenance dialysis patients who dialyze--
    (A) In an independent or hospital-based ESRD facility, or
    (B) At home.
    (ii) Hospital inpatients for which the physician elects to continue 
payment under the monthly capitation payment (MCP) method described in 
Sec. 414.314.
    (2) Applicability. These provisions apply to routine professional 
services of physicians. They do not apply to administrative services 
performed by physicians, which are paid for as part of a prospective 
payment for dialysis services made to the facility under Sec. 413.170 of 
this chapter.
    (c) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following 
definitions apply:
    Administrative services are physician services that are 
differentiated from routine professional services and other physician 
services because they are supervision, as described in the definition of 
``supervision of staff'' of this section, or are not related directly to 
the care of an individual patient, but are supportive of the facility as 
a whole and of benefit to patients in general. Examples of 
administrative services include supervision of staff, staff training, 
participation in staff conferences and in the management of the 
facility, and advising staff on the procurement of supplies.
    Dialysis session is the period of time that begins when the patient 
arrives at

[[Page 480]]

the facility and ends when the patient departs from the facility. In the 
case of home dialysis, the period begins when the patient prepares for 
dialysis and generally ends when the patient is disconnected from the 
machine. In this context, a dialysis facility includes only those parts 
of the building used as a facility. It does not include any areas used 
as a physician's office.
    Medical direction, in contrast to supervision of staff, is a routine 
professional service that entails substantial direct involvement and the 
physical presence of the physician in the delivery of services directly 
to the patient.
    Routine professional services include all physicians' services 
furnished during a dialysis session and all services listed in paragraph 
(d) of this section that meet the following requirements:
    (1) They are personally furnished by a physician to an individual 
patient.
    (2) They contribute directly to the diagnosis or treatment of an 
individual patient.
    (3) They ordinarily must be performed by a physician.
    Supervision of staff, in contrast to medical direction, is an 
administrative service that does not necessarily require the physician 
to be present at the dialysis session. It is a general activity 
primarily concerned with monitoring performance of and giving guidance 
to other health care personnel (such as nurses and dialysis technicians) 
who deliver services to patients.
    (d) Types of routine professional services. Routine professional 
services include at least all of the following services when medically 
appropriate:
    (1) Visits to the patient during dialysis, and review of laboratory 
test results, nurses' notes and any other medical documentation, as a 
basis for--
    (i) Adjustment of the patient's medication or diet, or the dialysis 
procedure;
    (ii) Prescription of medical supplies; and
    (iii) Evaluation of the patient's psychosocial status and the 
appropriateness of the treatment modality.
    (2) Medical direction of staff in delivering services to a patient 
during a dialysis session.
    (3) Pre-dialysis and post-dialysis examinations, or examinations 
that could have been furnished on a pre-dialysis or post-dialysis basis.
    (4) Insertion of catheters for patients who are on peritoneal 
dialysis and do not have indwelling catheters.
    (e) Payment for routine professional services. Beginning August 7, 
1990, routine professional services furnished by physicians may be paid 
under either the ``initial method'' of payment described in 
Sec. 414.313, (if all of the physicians at the facility elect the 
initial method) or under the ``physician MCP method'' described in 
Sec. 414.314. Physician services furnished after July 31, 1983 and 
before August 6, 1990, are payable only under the MCP method described 
in Sec. 414.314.


<R05>
Sec. 414.313  Initial method of payment.

    (a) Basic rule. Under this method, the intermediary pays the 
facility for routine professional services furnished by physicians. 
Payment is in the form of an add-on to the facility's composite rate 
payment, which is described in part 413, subpart H of this subchapter.
    (b) Services for which payment is not included in the add-on 
payment. (1) Physician administrative services are considered to be 
facility services and are paid for as part of the facility's composite 
rate.
    (2) The carrier pays the physician or the beneficiary (as 
appropriate) under the reasonable charge criteria set forth in subpart E 
of part 405 of this chapter for the following services:
    (i) Physician services that must be furnished at a time other than 
during the dialysis session (excluding pre-dialysis and post-dialysis 
examinations and examinations that could have been furnished on a pre-
dialysis or post-dialysis basis), such as monthly and semi-annual 
examinations to review health status and treatment.
    (ii) Physician surgical services other than insertion of catheters 
for patients who are on peritoneal dialysis and do not have indwelling 
catheters.
    (iii) Physician services furnished to hospital inpatients who were 
not admitted solely to receive maintenance dialysis.
    (iv) Administration of hepatitis B vaccine.
    (c) Physician election of the initial method. (1) Each physician in 
a facility

[[Page 481]]

must submit to the appropriate carrier and intermediary that serve the 
facility a statement of election of the initial method of payment for 
all the ESRD facility patients that he or she attends.
    (2) The initial method of payment applies to dialysis services 
furnished beginning with the second calendar month after the month in 
which all physicians in the facility elect the initial method and 
continues until the effective date of a termination of the election 
described in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) Termination of the initial method. (1) Physicians may terminate 
the initial method of payment by written notice to the carrier(s) that 
serves each physician and to the intermediary that serves the facility.
    (2) If the notice terminating the initial method is received by the 
carrier(s) and intermediary--
    (i) On or before November 1, the effective date of the termination 
is January 1 of the year following the calendar year in which the 
termination notice is received by the carrier(s) and intermediary; or
    (ii) After November 1, the effective date of the termination is 
January 1 of the second year after the calendar year in which the notice 
is received by the carrier(s) and intermediary.
    (e) Determination of payment amount. The factors used in determining 
the add-on amount are related to program experience. They are re-
evaluated periodically and may be adjusted, as determined necessary by 
HCFA, to maintain the payment at a level commensurate with the 
prevailing charges of other physicians for comparable services.
    (f) Publication of payment amount. Revisions to the add-on amounts 
are published in the Federal Register in accordance with the 
Department's established rulemaking procedures.

<R05>
Sec. 414.314  Monthly capitation payment method.

    (a) Basic rules. (1) Under the monthly capitation payment (MCP) 
method, the carrier pays an MCP amount for each patient, to cover all 
professional services furnished by the physician, except those listed in 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) The carrier pays the MCP amount, subject to the deductible and 
coinsurance provisions, either to the physician if the physician accepts 
assignment or to the beneficiary if the physician does not accept 
assignment.
    (3) The MCP method recognizes the need of maintenance dialysis 
patients for physician services furnished periodically over relatively 
long periods of time, and the capitation amounts are consistent with 
physicians' charging patterns in their localities.
    (4) Payment of the capitation amount for any particular month is 
contingent upon the physician furnishing to the patient all physician 
services required by the patient during the month, except those listed 
in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (5) Payment for physician administrative services (Sec. 414.310) is 
made to the dialysis facility as part of the facility's composite rate 
(part 413, subpart H of this subchapter) and not to the physician under 
the MCP.
    (b) Services not included in the MCP. (1) Services that are not 
included in the MCP and which may be paid in accordance with the 
reasonable charge rules set forth in subpart E of part 405 of this 
chapter are limited to the following:
    (i) Administration of hepatitis B vaccine.
    (ii) Covered physician services furnished by another physician when 
the patient is not available to receive, or the attending physician is 
not available to furnish, the outpatient services as usual (see 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section).
    (iii) Covered physician services furnished to hospital inpatients, 
including services related to inpatient dialysis, by a physician who 
elects not to continue to receive the MCP during the period of inpatient 
stay.
    (iv) Surgical services, including declotting of shunts, other than 
the insertion of catheters for patients on maintenance peritoneal 
dialysis who do not have indwelling catheters.
    (v) Needed physician services that are--

[[Page 482]]

    (A) Furnished by the physician furnishing renal care or by another 
physician;
    (B) Not related to the treatment of the patient's renal condition; 
and
    (C) Not furnished during a dialysis session or an office visit 
required because of the patient's renal condition.
    (2) For the services described in paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this 
section, the following rules apply:
    (i) The physician must provide documentation to show that the 
services are not related to the treatment of the patient's renal 
condition and that additional visits are required.
    (ii) The carrier's medical staff, acting on the basis of the 
documentation and appropriate medical consultation obtained by the 
carrier, determines whether additional payment for the additional 
services is warranted.
    (3) The MCP is reduced in proportion to the number of days the 
patient is--
    (i) Hospitalized and the physician elects to bill separately for 
services furnished during hospitalization; or
    (ii) Not attended by the physician or his or her substitute for any 
reason, including when the physician is not available to furnish patient 
care or when the patient is not available to receive care.
    (c) Determination of payment amount. The amount of payment for the 
MCP is determined under the Medicare physician fee schedule described in 
this part 414.

[55 FR 23441, June 8, 1990, as amended at 59 FR 63463, Dec. 8, 1994; 62

<R05>
Sec. 414.316  Payment for physician services to patients in training for self-dialysis and home dialysis.

    (a) For each patient, the carrier pays a flat amount that covers all 
physician services required to create the capacity for self-dialysis and 
home dialysis.
    (b) HCFA determines the amount on the basis of program experience 
and reviews it periodically.
    (c) The payment is made at the end of the training course, is 
subject to the deductible and coinsurance provisions, and is in addition 
to any amounts payable under the initial or MCP methods set forth in 
Secs. 414.313 and 414.314, respectively.
    (d) If the training is not completed, the payment amount is 
proportionate to the time spent in training.


<R05>
Sec. 414.320  Determination of reasonable charges for physician renal transplantation services.

    (a) Comprehensive payment for services furnished during a 60-day 
period. (1) The comprehensive payment is subject to the deductible and 
coinsurance provisions and is for all surgeon services furnished during 
a period of 60 days in connection with a renal transplantation, 
including the usual preoperative and postoperative care, and for 
immunosuppressant therapy if supervised by the transplant surgeon.
    (2) Additional sums, in amounts established on the basis of program 
experience, may be included in the comprehensive payment for other 
surgery performed concurrently with the transplant operation.
    (3) The amount of the comprehensive payment may not exceed the lower 
of the following:
    (i) The actual charges made for the services.
    (ii) Overall national payment levels established under the ESRD 
program and adjusted to give effect to variations in physician's charges 
throughout the nation. (These adjusted amounts are the maximum 
allowances in a carrier's service area for renal transplantation surgery 
and related services by surgeons.)
    (4) Maximum allowances computed under these instructions are revised 
at the beginning of each calendar year to the extent permitted by the 
lesser of the following:
    (i) Changes in the economic index as described in 
Sec. 405.504(a)(3)(i) of this chapter.
    (ii) Percentage changes in the weighted average of the carrier's 
prevailing charges (before adjustment by the economic index) for--
    (A) A unilateral nephrectomy; or
    (B) Another medical or surgical service designated by HCFA for this 
purpose.
    (b) Other payments. Payments for covered medical services furnished 
to the transplant recipient by other specialists, as well as for 
services by the

[[Page 483]]

transplant surgeon after the 60-day period covered by the comprehensive 
payment, are made under the reasonable charge criteria set forth in 
Sec. 405.502 (a) through (d) of this chapter. The payments for 
physicians' services in connection with renal transplantations are 
changed on the basis of program experience and the expected advances in 
the medical art for this operation.


<R05>
Sec. 414.330  Payment for home dialysis equipment, supplies, and support services.

    (a) Equipment and supplies--(1) Basic rule. Except as provided in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, Medicare pays for home dialysis 
equipment and supplies only under the prospective payment rates 
established at Sec. 413.170.
    (2) Exception. If the conditions in subparagraphs (a)(2) (i) through 
(iv) of this section are met, Medicare pays for home analysis equipment 
and supplies on a reasonable charge basis in accordance with subpart E 
(Criteria for Determination of Reasonable Charges; Reimbursement for 
Services of Hospital Interns, Residents, and Supervising Physicians) of 
part 405, but the amount of payment may not exceed the limit for 
equipment and supplies in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (i) The patient elects to obtain home dialysis equipment and 
supplies from a supplier that is not a Medicare approved dialysis 
facility.
    (ii) The patient certifies to HCFA that he or she has only one 
supplier for all home dialysis equipment and supplies. This 
certification is made on HCFA Form 382 (the ``ESRD Beneficiary 
Selection'' form).
    (iii) In writing, the supplier--
    (A) Agrees to receive Medicare payment for home dialysis supplies 
and equipment only on an assignment-related basis; and
    (B) Certifies to HCFA that it has a written agreement with one 
Medicare approved dialysis facility or, if the beneficiary is also 
entitled to military or veteran's benefits, one military or Veterans 
Administration hospital, for each patient. (See subpart U of part 405 of 
this chapter for the requirements for a Medicare approved dialysis 
facility.) Under the agreement, the facility or military or VA hospital 
agrees to the following:
    (1) To furnish all home dialysis support services for each patient 
in accordance with subpart U (Conditions for Coverage of Suppliers of 
ESRD Services) of this chapter. (Sec. 410.52 sets forth the scope and 
conditions of Medicare Part B coverage of home dialysis services, 
supplies, and equipment.)
    (2) To furnish institutional dialysis services and supplies. 
(Sec. 410.50 sets forth the scope and conditions for Medicare Part B 
coverage of institutional dialysis services and supplies.)
    (3) To furnish dialysis-related emergency services.
    (4) To arrange for a Medicare approved laboratory to perform 
dialysis-related laboratory tests that are covered under the composite 
rate established at Sec. 413.170 and to arrange for the laboratory to 
seek payment from the facility. The facility then includes these 
laboratory services in its claim for payment for home dialysis support 
services.
    (5) To arrange for a Medicare approved laboratory to perform 
dialysis-related laboratory tests that are not covered under the 
composite rate established at Sec. 413.170 and for which the laboratory 
files a Medicare claim directly.
    (6) To furnish all other necessary dialysis services and supplies 
(that is, those which are not home dialysis equipment and supplies).
    (7) To satisfy all documentation, recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements in subpart U (Conditions for Coverage of Suppliers of ESRD 
Services) of this chapter. This includes maintaining a complete medical 
record of ESRD related items and services furnished by other parties. 
The facility must report, on the forms required by HCFA or the ESRD 
network, all data for each patient in accordance with subpart U.
    (iv) The facility with which the agreement is made must be located 
within a reasonable distance from the patient's home (that is, located 
so that the facility can actually furnish the needed services in a 
practical and timely manner, taking into account variables like the 
terrain, whether the patient's home is located in an urban or

[[Page 484]]

rural area, the availability of transportation, and the usual distances 
traveled by patients in the area to obtain health care services).
    (b) Support services--(1) Basic rule. Except as provided in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, Medicare pays for support services 
only under the prospective payment rates established in Sec. 413.170 of 
this chapter.
    (2) Exceptions. If the patient elects to obtain home dialysis 
equipment and supplies from a supplier that is not an approved ESRD 
facility, Medicare pays for support services, other than support 
services furnished by military or VA hospitals referred to in paragraph 
(a)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, under paragraphs (b)(2) (i) and (ii) of 
this section but in no case may the amount of payment exceed the limit 
for support services in paragraph (c)(1) of this section:
    (i) For support services furnished by a hospital-based ESRD 
facility, Medicare pays on a reasonable cost basis in accordance with 
part 413 of this chapter.
    (ii) For support services furnished by an independent ESRD facility, 
Medicare pays on the basis of reasonable charges that are related to 
costs and allowances that are reasonable when the services are furnished 
in an effective and economical manner.
    (c) Payment limits--(1) Support services. The amount of payment for 
home dialysis support services is limited to the national average 
Medicare-allowed charge per patient per month for home dialysis support 
services, as determined by HCFA, plus the median cost per treatment for 
all dialysis facilities for laboratory tests included under the 
composite rate, as determined by HCFA, multiplied by the national 
average number of treatments per month.
    (2) Equipment and supplies. Payment for home dialysis equipment and 
supplies is limited to an amount equal to the result obtained by 
subtracting the support services payment limit in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section from the amount (or, in the case of continuous cycling 
peritoneal dialysis, 130 percent) of the national median payment as 
determined by HCFA that would have been made under the prospective 
payment rates established in Sec. 413.170 of this chapter for hospital-
based facilities.
    (3) Notification of changes to the payment limits. Updated data are 
incorporated into the payment limits when the prospective payment rates 
established at Sec. 413.170 of this chapter are updated, and changes are 
announced by notice in the Federal Register without a public comment 
period. Revisions of the methodology for determining the limits are 
published in the Federal Register in accordance with the Department's 
established rulemaking procedures.

Sec. 414.335  Payment for EPO furnished to a home dialysis patient for use in the home.

    (a) Payment for EPO used at home by a home dialysis patient is made 
only to either a Medicare approved ESRD facility or a supplier of home 
dialysis equipment and supplies.
    (b) Payment is made in accordance with the rules set forth in 
Sec. 413.170 of this chapter.

<R04>
                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 415.1  Basis and scope.

    (a) Basis. This part is based on the provisions of the following 
sections of the Act: Section 1848 establishes a fee schedule for payment 
for physician services. Section 1861(q) specifies what is included in 
the term ``physician services'' covered under Medicare. Section 
1862(a)(14) sets forth the exclusion of nonphysician services furnished 
to hospital patients under Part B of Medicare. Section 1886(d)(5)(B) 
provides for a payment adjustment under the prospective payment system 
for the operating costs of inpatient hospital services furnished to 
Medicare beneficiaries in cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 1983, to account for the indirect costs of medical education. 
Section 1886(h) establishes the methodology for Medicare payment of the 
cost of direct GME activities.
    (b) Scope. This part sets forth rules for fiscal intermediary 
payments to providers for physician services, Part B carrier payments 
for physician services to beneficiaries in providers, physician services 
in teaching settings, and services of residents.


<R04>
   Subpart B--Fiscal Intermediary Payments to Providers for Physician 
                                Services


<R05>
Sec. 415.50  Scope.

    This subpart sets forth rules for payment by fiscal intermediaries 
to providers for services furnished by physicians. Payment for covered 
services is made either under the prospective payment system (PPS) to 
PPS-participating providers in accordance with part 412 of this chapter 
or under the reasonable cost method to non-PPS participating providers 
in accordance with part 413 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 415.55  General payment rules.

    (a) Allowable costs. Except as specified otherwise in Secs. 413.102 
of this chapter (concerning compensation of owners), 415.60 (concerning 
allocation of physician compensation costs), and 415.162 (concerning 
payment for physician services furnished to beneficiaries in teaching 
hospitals), costs a provider incurs for services of physicians are 
allowable only if the following conditions are met:
    (1) The services do not meet the conditions in Sec. 415.102(a) 
regarding fee schedule payment for services of physicians to a 
beneficiary in a provider.

[[Page 486]]

    (2) The services include a surgeon's supervision of services of a 
qualified anesthetist, but do not include physician availability 
services, except for reasonable availability services furnished for 
emergency rooms and the services of standby surgical team physicians.
    (3) The provider has incurred a cost for salary or other 
compensation it furnished the physician for the services.
    (4) The costs incurred by the provider for the services meet the 
requirements in Sec. 413.9 of this chapter regarding costs related to 
patient care.
    (5) The costs do not include supervision of interns and residents 
unless the provider elects reasonable cost payment as specified in 
Sec. 415.160, or any other costs incurred in connection with an approved 
GME program that are payable under Sec. 413.86 of this chapter.
    (b) Allocation of allowable costs. The provider must follow the 
rules in Sec. 415.60 regarding allocation of physician compensation 
costs to determine its costs of services.
    (c) Limits on allowable costs. The intermediary must apply the 
limits on compensation set forth in Sec. 415.70 to determine its 
payments to a provider for the costs of services.


<R05>
Sec. 415.60  Allocation of physician compensation costs.

    (a) Definition. For purposes of this subpart, physician compensation 
costs means monetary payments, fringe benefits, deferred compensation, 
and any other items of value (excluding office space or billing and 
collection services) that a provider or other organization furnishes a 
physician in return for the physician services. Other organizations are 
entities related to the provider within the meaning of Sec. 413.17 of 
this chapter or entities that furnish services for the provider under 
arrangements within the meaning of the Act.
    (b) General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, each provider that incurs physician compensation costs must 
allocate those costs, in proportion to the percentage of total time that 
is spent in furnishing each category of services, among--
    (1) Physician services to the provider (as described in 
Sec. 415.55);
    (2) Physician services to patients (as described in Sec. 415.102); 
and
    (3) Activities of the physician, such as funded research, that are 
not paid under either Part A or Part B of Medicare.
    (c) Allowable physician compensation costs. Only costs allocated to 
payable physician services to the provider (as described in Sec. 415.55) 
are allowable costs to the provider under this subpart.
    (d) Allocation of all compensation to services to the provider. 
Generally, the total physician compensation received by a physician is 
allocated among all services furnished by the physician, unless--
    (1) The provider certifies that the compensation is attributable 
solely to the physician services furnished to the provider; and
    (2) The physician bills all patients for the physician services he 
or she furnishes to them and personally receives the payment from or on 
behalf of the patients. If returned directly or indirectly to the 
provider or an organization related to the provider within the meaning 
of Sec. 413.17 of this chapter, these payments are not compensation for 
physician services furnished to the provider.
    (e) Assumed allocation of all compensation to beneficiary services. 
If the provider and physician agree to accept the assumed allocation of 
all the physician services to direct services to beneficiaries as 
described under Sec. 415.102(a), HCFA does not require a written 
allocation agreement between the physician and the provider.
    (f) Determination and payment of allowable physician compensation 
costs. (1) Except as provided under paragraph (e) of this section, the 
intermediary pays the provider for these costs only if--
    (i) The provider submits to the intermediary a written allocation 
agreement between the provider and the physician that specifies the 
respective amounts of time the physician spends in furnishing physician 
services to the provider, physician services to patients, and services 
that are not payable under either Part A or Part B of Medicare; and
    (ii) The compensation is reasonable in terms of the time devoted to 
these services.

[[Page 487]]

    (2) In the absence of a written allocation agreement, the 
intermediary assumes, for purposes of determining reasonable costs of 
the provider, that 100 percent of the physician compensation cost is 
allocated to services to beneficiaries as specified in paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section.
    (g) Recordkeeping requirements. Except for services furnished in 
accordance with the assumed allocation under paragraph (e) of this 
section, each provider that claims payment for services of physicians 
under this subpart must meet all of the following requirements:
    (1) Maintain the time records or other information it used to 
allocate physician compensation in a form that permits the information 
to be validated by the intermediary or the carrier.
    (2) Report the information on which the physician compensation 
allocation is based to the intermediary or the carrier on an annual 
basis and promptly notify the intermediary or carrier of any revisions 
to the compensation allocation.
    (3) Retain each physician compensation allocation, and the 
information on which it is based, for at least 4 years after the end of 
each cost reporting period to which the allocation applies.


<R05>
Sec. 415.70  Limits on compensation for physician services in providers.

    (a) Principle and scope. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) 
and (a)(3) of this section, HCFA establishes reasonable compensation 
equivalency limits on the amount of compensation paid to physicians by 
providers. These limits are applied to a provider's costs incurred in 
compensating physicians for services to the provider, as described in 
Sec. 415.55(a).
    (2) Limits established under this section do not apply to costs of 
physician compensation attributable to furnishing inpatient hospital 
services that are paid for under the prospective payment system 
implemented under part 412 of this chapter or to costs of physician 
compensation attributable to approved GME programs that are payable 
under Sec. 413.86 of this chapter.
    (3) Compensation that a physician receives for activities that may 
not be paid for under either Part A or Part B of Medicare is not 
considered in applying these limits.
    (b) Methodology for establishing limits. HCFA establishes a 
methodology for determining annual reasonable compensation equivalency 
limits and, to the extent possible, considers average physician incomes 
by specialty and type of location using the best available data.
    (c) Application of limits. If the level of compensation exceeds the 
limits established under paragraph (b) of this section, Medicare payment 
is based on the level established by the limits.
    (d) Adjustment of the limits. The intermediary may adjust limits 
established under paragraph (b) of this section to account for costs 
incurred by the physician or the provider related to malpractice 
insurance, professional memberships, and continuing medical education.
    (1) For the costs of membership in professional societies and 
continuing medical education, the intermediary may adjust the limit by 
the lesser of--
    (i) The actual cost incurred by the provider or the physician for 
these activities; or
    (ii) Five percent of the appropriate limit.
    (2) For the cost of malpractice expenses incurred by either the 
provider or the physician, the intermediary may adjust the reasonable 
compensation equivalency limit by the cost of the malpractice insurance 
expense related to the physician service furnished to patients in 
providers.
    (e) Exception to limits. An intermediary may grant a provider an 
exception to the limits established under paragraph (b) of this section 
only if the provider can demonstrate to the intermediary that it is 
unable to recruit or maintain an adequate number of physicians at a 
compensation level within these limits.
    (f) Notification of changes in methodologies and payment limits. (1) 
Before the start of a cost reporting period to which limits established 
under this section will be applied, HCFA publishes a notice in the 
Federal Register that sets forth the amount of the limits and explains 
how it calculated the limits.
    (2) If HCFA proposes to revise the methodology for establishing 
payment

[[Page 488]]

limits under this section, HCFA publishes a notice, with opportunity for 
public comment, in the Federal Register. The notice explains the 
proposed basis and methodology for setting limits, specifies the limits 
that would result, and states the date of implementation of the limits.
    (3) If HCFA updates limits by applying the most recent economic 
index data without revising the limit methodology, HCFA publishes the 
revised limits in a notice in the Federal Register without prior 
publication of a proposal or public comment period.


<R04>
      Subpart C--Part B Carrier Payments for Physician Services to 
                       Beneficiaries in Providers


<R05>
Sec. 415.100  Scope.

    This subpart implements section 1887(a)(1)(A) of the Act by 
providing general conditions that must be met in order for services 
furnished by physicians to beneficiaries in providers to be paid for on 
the basis of the physician fee schedule under part 414 of this chapter. 
Section 415.102 sets forth the conditions for fee schedule payment for 
physician services to beneficiaries in providers. Section 415.105 sets 
forth general requirements for determining the amounts of payment for 
services that meet the conditions of this section. Sections 415.120 and 
415.130 set forth additional conditions for payment for physician 
services in the specialties of radiology and pathology (laboratory 
services).


<R05>
Sec. 415.102  Conditions for fee schedule payment for physician services to beneficiaries in providers.

    (a) General rule. If the physician furnishes services to 
beneficiaries in providers, the carrier pays on a fee schedule basis 
provided the following requirements are met:
    (1) The services are personally furnished for an individual 
beneficiary by a physician.
    (2) The services contribute directly to the diagnosis or treatment 
of an individual beneficiary.
    (3) The services ordinarily require performance by a physician.
    (4) In the case of radiology or laboratory services, the additional 
requirements in Sec. 415.120 or Sec. 415.130, respectively, are met.
    (b) Exception. If a physician furnishes services in a provider that 
do not meet the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section, but are 
related to beneficiary care furnished by the provider, the intermediary 
pays for those services, if otherwise covered. The intermediary follows 
the rules in Secs. 415.55 and 415.60 for payment on the basis of 
reasonable cost or PPS, as appropriate.
    (c) Effect of billing charges for physician services to a provider.
    (1) If a physician furnishes services that may be paid under the 
reasonable cost rules in Sec. 415.55 or Sec. 415.60, and paid by the 
intermediary, or would be paid under those rules except for the PPS 
rules in part 412 of this chapter, and under the payment rules for GME 
established by Sec. 413.86 of this chapter, neither the provider nor the 
physician may seek payment from the carrier, beneficiary, or another 
insurer.
    (2) If a physician furnishes services to an individual beneficiary 
that do not meet the applicable conditions in Secs. 415.120 (concerning 
conditions for payment for radiology services) and 415.130 (concerning 
conditions for payment for physician pathology services), the carrier 
does not pay on a fee schedule basis.
    (3) If the physician, the provider, or another entity bills the 
carrier or the beneficiary or another insurer for physician services 
furnished to the provider, as described in Sec. 415.55(a), HCFA 
considers the provider to which the services are furnished to have 
violated its provider participation agreement, and may terminate that 
agreement. See part 489 of this chapter for rules governing provider 
agreements.
    (d) Effect of physician assumption of operating costs. If a 
physician or other entity enters into an agreement (such as a lease or 
concession) with a provider, and the physician (or entity) assumes some 
or all of the operating costs of the provider department in which the 
physician furnishes physician services, the following rules apply:
    (1) If the conditions set forth in paragraph (a) of this section are 
met, the carrier pays for the physician services

[[Page 489]]

under the physician fee schedule in part 414 of this chapter.
    (2) To the extent the provider incurs a cost payable on a reasonable 
cost basis under part 413 of this chapter, the intermediary pays the 
provider on a reasonable cost basis for the costs associated with 
producing these services, including overhead, supplies, equipment costs, 
and services furnished by nonphysician personnel.
    (3) The physician (or other entity) is treated as being related to 
the provider within the meaning of Sec. 413.17 of this chapter 
(concerning cost to related organizations).
    (4) The physician (or other entity) must make its books and records 
available to the provider and the intermediary as necessary to verify 
the nature and extent of the costs of the services furnished by the 
physician (or other entity).


<R05>
Sec. 415.105  Amounts of payment for physician services to beneficiaries in providers.

    (a) General rule. The carrier determines amounts of payment for 
physician services to beneficiaries in providers in accordance with the 
general rules governing the physician fee schedule payment in part 414 
of this chapter, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Application in certain settings--(1) Teaching hospitals. The 
carrier applies the rules in subpart D of this part (concerning 
physician services in teaching settings), in addition to those in this 
section, in determining whether fee schedule payment should be made for 
physician services to individual beneficiaries in a teaching hospital.
    (2) Hospital-based ESRD facilities. The carrier applies 
Secs. 414.310 through 414.314 of this chapter, which set forth 
determination of reasonable charges under the ESRD program, to determine 
the amount of payment for physician services furnished to individual 
beneficiaries in a hospital-based ESRD facility approved under part 405 
subpart U.


<R05>
Sec. 415.110  Conditions for payment: Anesthesiology services.

    (a) Services furnished directly or concurrently. The carrier pays a 
physician for anesthesia services furnished to patients in a provider on 
a fee schedule basis only if the services meet the conditions in 
Sec. 415.102(a) and the following additional conditions:
    (1) For each patient, the physician--
    (i) Performs a pre-anesthetic examination and evaluation;
    (ii) Prescribes the anesthesia plan;
    (iii) Personally participates in the most demanding procedures in 
the anesthesia plan, including induction and emergence;
    (iv) Ensures that any procedures in the anesthesia plan that he or 
she does not perform are performed by a qualified individual as defined 
in program operating instructions;
    (v) Monitors the course of anesthesia administration at frequent 
intervals;
    (vi) Remains physically present and available for immediate 
diagnosis and treatment of emergencies; and
    (vii) Provides indicated post-anesthesia care.
    (2) The physician performs the procedure personally or directs no 
more than four anesthesia procedures concurrently and does not perform 
any other services while he or she is directing the concurrent 
procedures.
    (b) Supervision of more than four procedures concurrently. If a 
physician is involved in furnishing more than four procedures 
concurrently, or is performing other services while directing the 
concurrent procedures, the concurrent anesthesia services are physician 
services to the provider in which the procedures are performed. In these 
cases, the physician is not required to meet the criteria of paragraphs 
(a)(1) (iii) and (vii) of this section personally, but must ensure that 
a qualified individual performs any procedure in which the physician 
does not personally participate. In these cases, the intermediary pays 
for the services under the rules in Secs. 415.55 and 415.60 on 
reasonable cost payment for physician services to providers or under the 
rules in part 412 of this chapter for payment under the prospective 
payment system.


<R05>
Sec. 415.120  Conditions for payment: Radiology services.

    (a) Services to beneficiaries. The carrier pays for radiology 
services furnished by a physician to a beneficiary

[[Page 490]]

on a fee schedule basis only if the services meet the conditions for fee 
schedule payment in Sec. 415.102(a) and are identifiable, direct, and 
discrete diagnostic or therapeutic services furnished to an individual 
beneficiary, such as interpretation of x-ray plates, angiograms, 
myelograms, pyelograms, or ultrasound procedures. The carrier pays for 
interpretations only if there is a written report prepared for inclusion 
in the patient's medical record maintained by the hospital.
    (b) Services to providers. The carrier does not pay on a fee 
schedule basis for physician services to the provider (for example, 
administrative or supervisory services) or for provider services needed 
to produce the x-ray films or other items that are interpreted by the 
radiologist. However, the intermediary pays the provider for these 
services in accordance with Sec. 415.55 for provider costs; 
Sec. 415.102(d)(2) for costs incurred by a physician, such as under a 
lease or concession agreement; or part 412 of this chapter for payment 
under PPS.


<R05>
Sec. 415.130  Conditions for payment: Physician pathology services.

    (a) Physician pathology services. The carrier pays for pathology 
services furnished by a physician to an individual beneficiary on a fee 
schedule basis only if the services meet the conditions for payment in 
Sec. 415.102(a) and are one of the following services:
    (1) Surgical pathology services.
    (2) Specific cytopathology, hematology, and blood banking services 
that have been identified to require performance by a physician and are 
listed in program operating instructions.
    (3) Clinical consultation services that meet the requirements in 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (4) Clinical laboratory interpretative services that meet the 
requirements of paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of this section 
and that are specifically listed in program operating instructions.
    (b) Clinical consultation services. For purposes of this section, 
clinical consultation services must meet the following requirements:
    (1) Be requested by the beneficiary's attending physician.
    (2) Relate to a test result that lies outside the clinically 
significant normal or expected range in view of the condition of the 
beneficiary.
    (3) Result in a written narrative report included in the 
beneficiary's medical record.
    (4) Require the exercise of medical judgment by the consultant 
physician.
    (c) Physician pathology services furnished by an independent 
laboratory. Laboratory services, including the technical component of a 
service, furnished to a hospital inpatient or outpatient by an 
independent laboratory are paid on a fee schedule basis under this 
subpart only if they are physician pathology services as described in 
paragraph (a) of this section.


<R04>
           Subpart D--Physician Services in Teaching Settings


<R05>
Sec. 415.150  Scope.

    This subpart sets forth the rules governing payment for the services 
of physicians in teaching settings and the criteria for determining 
whether the payments are made as one of the following:
    (a) Services to the hospital under the reasonable cost election in 
Secs. 415.160 through 415.164.
    (b) Provider services through the direct GME payment mechanism in 
Sec. 413.86 of this chapter.
    (c) Physician services to beneficiaries under the physician fee 
schedule as set forth in part 414 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 415.152  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart--
    Approved graduate medical education (GME) program means one of the 
following:
    (1) A residency program approved by the Accreditation Council for 
Graduate Medical Education of the American Medical Association, by the 
Committee on Hospitals of the Bureau of Professional Education of the 
American Osteopathic Association, by the Council on Dental Education of 
the American Dental Association, or by the Council on Podiatric Medicine

<R05>
Sec. 415.162  Determining payment for physician services furnished to beneficiaries in teaching hospitals.

    (a) General rule. Payments for direct medical and surgical services 
of physicians furnished to beneficiaries and supervision of interns and 
residents furnishing care to beneficiaries is made by Medicare on the 
basis of reasonable

[[Page 492]]

cost if the hospital exercises the election as provided for in 
Sec. 415.160. If this election is made, the following occurs:
    (1) Physician services furnished to beneficiaries and supervision of 
interns and residents furnishing care to beneficiaries are paid on a 
reasonable-cost basis, as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) Payment for certain medical school costs may be made as provided 
for in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (3) Payments for services donated by volunteer physicians to 
beneficiaries are made to a fund designated by the organized medical 
staff of the teaching hospital or medical school as provided for in 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) Reasonable cost of physician services and supervision of interns 
and residents.
    (1) Physician services furnished to beneficiaries and supervision of 
interns and residents furnishing care to beneficiaries in a teaching 
hospital are payable as provider services on a reasonable-cost basis.
    (2) For purposes of this paragraph, reasonable cost is defined as 
the direct salary paid to these physicians, plus applicable fringe 
benefits.
    (3) The costs must be allocated to the services as provided by 
paragraph (j) of this section and apportioned to program beneficiaries 
as provided by paragraph (g) of this section.
    (4) Other allowable costs incurred by the provider related to the 
services described in this paragraph are payable subject to the 
requirements applicable to all other provider services.
    (c) Reasonable costs for the services furnished by a medical school 
or related organization in a hospital. An amount is payable to the 
hospital by HCFA under the Medicare program provided that the costs 
would be payable if incurred directly by the hospital rather than under 
the arrangement. The amount must not be in excess of the reasonable 
costs (as defined in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section) 
incurred by a teaching hospital for services furnished by a medical 
school or organization as described in Sec. 413.17 of this chapter for 
certain costs to the medical school (or a related organization) in 
furnishing services in the hospital.
    (1) Reasonable costs of physician services.
    (i) When the medical school and the hospital are related 
organizations. If the medical school (or organization related to the 
medical school) and the hospital are related by common ownership or 
control as described in Sec. 413.17 of this chapter--
    (A) The costs of these services are allowable costs to the hospital 
under the provisions of Sec. 413.17 of this chapter; and
    (B) The reimbursable costs to the hospital are determined under the 
provisions of this section in the same manner as the costs incurred for 
physicians on the hospital staff and without regard to payments made to 
the medical school by the hospital.
    (ii) When the medical school and the hospital are not related 
organizations.
    (A) If the medical school and the hospital are not related 
organizations under the provisions of Sec. 413.17 of this chapter and 
the hospital makes payment to the medical school for the costs of those 
services furnished to all patients, payment is made by Medicare to the 
hospital for the reasonable cost incurred by the hospital for its 
payments to the medical school for services furnished to beneficiaries.
    (B) Costs incurred under an arrangement must be allocated to the 
full range of services furnished to the hospital by the medical school 
physicians on the same basis as provided for under paragraph (j) of this 
section, and costs allocated to direct medical and surgical services 
furnished to hospital patients must be apportioned to beneficiaries as 
provided for under paragraph (g) of this section.
    (C) If the medical school and the hospital are not related 
organizations under the provisions of Sec. 413.17 of this chapter and 
the hospital makes payment to the medical school only for the costs of 
those services furnished to beneficiaries, costs of the medical school 
not to exceed 105 percent of the sum of physician direct salaries, 
applicable fringe benefits, employer's portion of FICA taxes, Federal 
and State unemployment taxes, and workmen's compensation paid by the 
medical school or an organization related to the medical school may be 
recognized

[[Page 493]]

as allowable costs of the medical school.
    (D) These allowable medical school costs must be allocated to the 
full range of services furnished by the physicians of the medical school 
or organization related as provided by paragraph (j) of this section.
    (E) Costs allocated to direct medical and surgical services 
furnished to hospital patients must be apportioned to beneficiaries as 
provided by paragraph (g) of this section.
    (2) Reasonable costs of other than direct medical and surgical 
services. These costs are determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section except that--
    (i) If the hospital makes payment to the medical school for other 
than direct medical and surgical services furnished to beneficiaries and 
supervision of interns and residents furnishing care to beneficiaries, 
these payments are subject to the required cost-finding and 
apportionment methods applicable to the cost of other hospital services 
(except for direct medical and surgical services furnished to 
beneficiaries); or
    (ii) If the hospital makes payment to the medical school only for 
these services furnished to beneficiaries, the cost of these services is 
not subject to cost-finding and apportionment as otherwise provided by 
this subpart, and the reasonable cost paid by Medicare must be 
determined on the basis of the health insurance ratio(s) used in the 
apportionment of all other provider costs (excluding physician direct 
medical and surgical services furnished to beneficiaries) applied to the 
allowable medical school costs incurred by the medical school for the 
services furnished to all patients of the hospital.
    (d) ``Salary equivalent'' payments for direct medical and surgical 
services furnished by physicians on the voluntary staff of the hospital.
    (1) HCFA makes payments under the Medicare program to a fund as 
defined in Sec. 415.164 for direct medical and surgical services 
furnished to beneficiaries on a regularly scheduled basis by physicians 
on the unpaid voluntary medical staff of the hospital (or medical school 
under arrangement with the hospital).
    (i) These payments represent compensation for contributed medical 
staff time which, if not contributed, would have to be obtained through 
employed staff on a payable basis.
    (ii) Payments for volunteer services are determined by applying to 
the regularly scheduled contributed time an hourly rate not to exceed 
the equivalent of the average direct salary (exclusive of fringe 
benefits) paid to all full-time, salaried physicians (other than interns 
and residents) on the hospital staff or, if the number of full-time 
salaried physicians is minimal in absolute terms or in relation to the 
number of physicians on the voluntary staff, to physicians at like 
institutions in the area.
    (iii) This ``salary equivalent'' is a single hourly rate covering 
all physicians regardless of specialty and is applied to the actual 
regularly scheduled time contributed by the physicians in furnishing 
direct medical and surgical services to beneficiaries including 
supervision of interns and residents in that care.
    (iv) A physician who receives any compensation from the hospital or 
a medical school related to the hospital by common ownership or control 
(within the meaning of Sec. 413.17 of this chapter) for direct medical 
and surgical services furnished to any patient in the hospital is not 
considered an unpaid voluntary physician for purposes of this paragraph.
    (v) If, however, a physician receives compensation from the hospital 
or related medical school or organization only for services that are 
other than direct medical and surgical services, a salary equivalent 
payment for the physician's regularly scheduled direct medical and 
surgical services to beneficiaries in the hospital may be imputed. 
However, the sum of the imputed value for volunteer services and the 
physician's actual compensation from the hospital and the related 
medical school (or organization) may not exceed the amount that would 
have been imputed if all of the physician's hospital and medical school 
services (compensated and volunteer) had been volunteer services, or 
paid at the rate of $30,000 per year, whichever is less.

[[Page 494]]

    (2) The following examples illustrate how the allowable imputed 
value for volunteer services is determined. In each example, it has been 
assumed that the average salary equivalent hourly rate is equal to the 
hourly rate for the individual physician's compensated services.

    Example No: 1. Dr. Jones received $3,000 a year from Hospital X for 
services other than direct medical services to all patients, for 
example, utilization review and administrative services. Dr. Jones also 
voluntarily furnished direct medical services to beneficiaries. The 
imputed value of the volunteer services amounted to $10,000 for the cost 
reporting period. The full imputed value of Dr. Jones' volunteer direct 
medical services would be allowed since the total amount of the imputed 
value ($10,000) and the compensated services ($3,000) does not exceed 
$30,000.
    Example No: 2. Dr. Smith received $25,000 from Hospital X for 
services as a department head in a teaching hospital. Dr. Smith also 
voluntarily furnished direct medical services to beneficiaries. The 
imputed value of the volunteer services amounted to $10,000. Only $5,000 
of the imputed value of volunteer services would be allowed since the 
total amount of the imputed value ($10,000) and the compensated services 
($25,000) exceeds the $30,000 maximum amount allowable for all of Dr. 
Smith's services.

                              Computation:

                                                                        
                                                                        
                                                                        
Maximum amount allowable for all services performed by Dr.              
 Smith for purposes of this computation......................    $30,000
Less compensation received from Hospital X for other than               
 direct medical services to individual patients..............    $25,000
Allowable amount of imputed value for the volunteer services            
 furnished by Dr. Smith......................................     $5,000
                                                                        

    Example No. 3. Dr. Brown is not compensated by Hospital X for any 
services furnished in the hospital. Dr. Brown voluntarily furnished 
direct surgical services to beneficiaries for a period of 6 months, and 
the imputed value of these services amounted to $20,000. The allowable 
amount of the imputed value for volunteer services furnished by Dr. 
Brown would be limited to $15,000 ($30,000 x 6/12).

    (3) The amount of the imputed value for volunteer services 
applicable to beneficiaries and payable to a fund is determined in 
accordance with the aggregate per diem method described in paragraph (g) 
of this section.
    (4) Medicare payments to a fund must be used by the fund solely for 
improvement of care of hospital patients or for educational or 
charitable purposes (which may include but are not limited to medical 
and other scientific research).
    (i) No personal financial gain, either direct or indirect, from 
benefits of the fund may inure to any of the hospital staff physicians, 
medical school faculty, or physicians for whom Medicare imputes costs 
for purposes of payment into the fund.
    (ii) Expenses met from contributions made to the hospital from a 
fund are not included as a reimbursable cost when expended by the 
hospital, and depreciation expense is not allowed with respect to 
equipment or facilities donated to the hospital by a fund or purchased 
by the hospital from monies in a fund.
    (e) Requirements for payment--(1) Physicians on the hospital staff. 
The requirements under which the costs of physician direct medical and 
surgical services (including supervision of interns and residents) to 
beneficiaries are the same as those applicable to the cost of all other 
covered provider services except that the costs of these services are 
separately determined as provided by this section and are not subject to 
cost-finding as described in Sec. 413.24 of this chapter.
    (2) Physicians on the medical school faculty. Payment is made to a 
hospital for the costs of services of physicians on the medical school 
faculty, provided that if the medical school is not related to the 
hospital (within the meaning of Sec. 413.17 of this chapter, concerning 
cost to related organizations), the hospital does not make payment to 
the medical school for services furnished to all patients and the 
following requirements are met: If the hospital makes payment to the 
medical school for services furnished to all patients, these 
requirements do not apply. (See paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.)
    (i) There is a written agreement between the hospital and the 
medical school or organization, specifying the

[[Page 495]]

types and extent of services to be furnished by the medical school and 
specifying that the hospital must pay to the medical school an amount at 
least equal to the reasonable cost (as defined in paragraph (c) of this 
section) of furnishing the services to beneficiaries.
    (ii) The costs are paid to the medical school by the hospital no 
later than the date on which the cost report covering the period in 
which the services were furnished is due to HCFA.
    (iii) Payment for the services furnished under an arrangement would 
have been made to the hospital had the services been furnished directly 
by the hospital.
    (3) Physicians on the voluntary staff of the hospital (or medical 
school under arrangement with the hospital). If the conditions for 
payment to a fund outlined in Sec. 415.164 are met, payments are made on 
a ``salary equivalent'' basis (as defined in paragraph (d) of this 
section) to a fund.
    (f) Requirements for payment for medical school faculty services 
other than physician direct medical and surgical services. If the 
requirements for payment for physician direct medical and surgical 
services furnished to beneficiaries in a teaching hospital described in 
paragraph (e) of this section are met, payment is made to a hospital for 
the costs of medical school faculty services other than physician direct 
medical and surgical services furnished in a teaching hospital.
    (g) Aggregate per diem methods of apportionment--(1) For the costs 
of physician direct medical and surgical services. The cost of physician 
direct medical and surgical services furnished in a teaching hospital to 
beneficiaries is determined on the basis of an average cost per diem as 
defined in paragraph (h)(1) of this section for physician direct medical 
and surgical services to all patients (see Secs. 415.172 through 
415.184) for each of the following categories of physicians:
    (i) Physicians on the hospital staff.
    (ii) Physicians on the medical school faculty.
    (2) For the imputed value of physician volunteer direct medical and 
surgical services. The imputed value of physician direct medical and 
surgical services furnished to beneficiaries in a teaching hospital is 
determined on the basis of an average per diem, as defined in paragraph 
(h)(1) of this section, for physician direct medical and surgical 
services to all patients except that the average per diem is derived 
from the imputed value of the physician volunteer direct medical and 
surgical services furnished to all patients.
    (h) Definitions. (1) Average cost per diem for physician direct 
medical and surgical services (including supervision of interns and 
residents) furnished in a teaching hospital to patients in each category 
of physician services described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section 
means the amount computed by dividing total reasonable costs of these 
services in each category by the sum of--
    (i) Inpatient days (as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of this section); 
and
    (ii) Outpatient visit days (as defined in paragraph (h)(3) of this 
section).
    (2) Inpatient days are determined by counting the day of admission 
as 3.5 days and each day after a patient's day of admission, except the 
day of discharge, as 1 day.
    (3) Outpatient visit days are determined by counting only one visit 
day for each calendar day that a patient visits an outpatient department 
or multiple outpatient departments.
    (i) Application. (1) The following illustrates how apportionment 
based on the aggregate per diem method for costs of physician direct 
medical and surgical services furnished in a teaching hospital to 
patients is determined.

    (2) The following illustrates how the imputed value of physician 
volunteer direct medical and surgical services furnished in a teaching 
hospital to beneficiaries is determined.
    Example: The physicians on the medical staff of Teaching Hospital Y 
donated a total of 5,000 hours in furnishing direct medical and surgical 
services to patients of the hospital during a cost reporting period and 
did not receive any compensation from either the hospital or the medical 
school. Also, the imputed value for any physician volunteer services did 
not exceed the rate of $30,000 per year per physician.

    (j) Allocation of compensation paid to physicians in a teaching 
hospital.
    (1) In determining reasonable cost under this section, the 
compensation paid by a teaching hospital, or a medical school or related 
organization under arrangement with the hospital, to physicians in a 
teaching hospital must be allocated to the full range of services 
implicit in the physician compensation arrangements. (However, see 
paragraph (d) of this section for the computation of the ``salary 
equivalent'' payments for volunteer services furnished to patients.)
    (2) This allocation must be made and must be capable of 
substantiation on the basis of the proportion of each physician's time 
spent in furnishing each type of service to the hospital or medical 
school.


<R05>
Sec. 415.164  Payment to a fund.

    (a) General rules. Payment for certain voluntary services by 
physicians in teaching hospitals (as these services are described in 
Sec. 415.160) is made on a salary equivalent basis (as described in 
Sec. 415.162(d)) subject to the conditions and limitations contained in 
parts 405 and 413 of this chapter and this part 415, to a single fund 
(as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) designated by the 
organized medical staff of the hospital (or, if the services are 
furnished in the hospital by the faculty of a medical school, to a fund 
as may be designated by the faculty), if the following conditions are 
met:
    (1) The hospital (or medical school furnishing the services under 
arrangement with the hospital) incurs no actual cost in furnishing the 
services.
    (2) The hospital has an agreement with HCFA under part 489 of this 
chapter.
    (3) The intermediary, or HCFA as appropriate, has received written 
assurances that--
    (i) The payment is used solely for the improvement of care of 
hospital patients or for educational or charitable purposes; and
    (ii) Neither the individuals who are furnished the services nor any 
other persons are charged for the services (and if charged, provision is 
made for the return of any monies incorrectly collected).

[[Page 498]]

    (b) Definition of a fund. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this 
section, a fund is an organization that meets either of the following 
requirements:
    (1) The organization has and retains exemption, as a governmental 
entity or under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code 
(nonprofit educational, charitable, and similar organizations), from 
Federal taxation.
    (2) The organization is an organization of physicians who, under the 
terms of their employment by an entity that meets the requirements of 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, are required to turn over to that 
entity all income that the physician organization derives from the 
physician services.
    (c) Status of a fund. A fund approved for payment under paragraph 
(a) of this section has all the rights and responsibilities of a 
provider under Medicare except that it does not enter into an agreement 
with HCFA under part 489 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 415.170  Conditions for payment on a fee schedule basis for physician services in a teaching setting.

    Services meeting the conditions for payment in Sec. 415.102(a) 
furnished in teaching settings are payable under the physician fee 
schedule if--
    (a) The services are personally furnished by a physician who is not 
a resident; or
    (b) The services are furnished by a resident in the presence of a 
teaching physician except as provided in Sec. 415.172 (concerning 
physician fee schedule payment for services of teaching physicians), 
Sec. 415.174 (concerning an exception for services furnished in hospital 
outpatient and certain other ambulatory settings), Sec. 415.176 
(concerning renal dialysis services), and Sec. 415.184 (concerning 
psychiatric services), as applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 415.172  Physician fee schedule payment for services of teaching physicians.

    (a) General rule. If a resident participates in a service furnished 
in a teaching setting, physician fee schedule payment is made only if a 
teaching physician is present during the key portion of any service or 
procedure for which payment is sought.
    (1) In the case of surgical, high-risk, or other complex procedures, 
the teaching physician must be present during all critical portions of 
the procedure and immediately available to furnish services during the 
entire service or procedure.
    (i) In the case of surgery, the teaching physician's presence is not 
required during opening and closing of the surgical field.
    (ii) In the case of procedures performed through an endoscope, the 
teaching physician must be present during the entire viewing.
    (2) In the case of evaluation and management services, the teaching 
physician must be present during the portion of the service that 
determines the level of service billed. (However, in the case of 
evaluation and management services furnished in hospital outpatient 
departments and certain other ambulatory settings, the requirements of 
Sec. 415.174 apply.)
    (b) Documentation. Except for services furnished as set forth in 
Secs. 415.174 (concerning an exception for services furnished in 
hospital outpatient and certain other ambulatory settings), 415.176 
(concerning renal dialysis services), and 415.184 (concerning 
psychiatric services), the medical records must document the teaching 
physician was present at the time the service is furnished. The presence 
of the teaching physician during procedures may be demonstrated by the 
notes in the medical records made by a physician, resident, or nurse. In 
the case of evaluation and management procedures, the teaching physician 
must personally document his or her participation in the service in the 
medical records.
    (c) Payment level. In the case of services such as evaluation and 
management for which there are several levels of service codes available 
for reporting purposes, the appropriate payment level must reflect the 
extent and complexity of the service when fully furnished by the 
teaching physician.


<R05>
Sec. 415.174  Exception: Evaluation and management services furnished in certain centers.

    (a) In the case of certain evaluation and management codes of lower 
and mid-level complexity (as specified by

[[Page 499]]

HCFA in program instructions), carriers may make physician fee schedule 
payment for a service furnished by a resident without the presence of a 
teaching physician. For the exception to apply, all of the following 
conditions must be met:
    (1) The services must be furnished in a center that is located in an 
outpatient department of a hospital or another ambulatory care entity in 
which the time spent by residents in patient care activities is included 
in determining intermediary payments to a hospital under Sec. 413.86.
    (2) Any resident furnishing the service without the presence of a 
teaching physician must have completed more than 6 months of an approved 
residency program.
    (3) The teaching physician must not direct the care of more than 
four residents at any given time and must direct the care from such 
proximity as to constitute immediate availability. The teaching 
physician must--
    (i) Have no other responsibilities at the time;
    (ii) Assume management responsibility for those beneficiaries seen 
by the residents;
    (iii) Ensure that the services furnished are appropriate;
    (iv) Review with each resident during or immediately after each 
visit, the beneficiary's medical history, physical examination, 
diagnosis, and record of tests and therapies; and
    (v) Document the extent of the teaching physician's participation in 
the review and direction of the services furnished to each beneficiary.
    (4) The range of services furnished by residents in the center 
includes all of the following:
    (i) Acute care for undifferentiated problems or chronic care for 
ongoing conditions.
    (ii) Coordination of care furnished by other physicians and 
providers.
    (iii) Comprehensive care not limited by organ system, or diagnosis.
    (5) The patients seen must be an identifiable group of individuals 
who consider the center to be the continuing source of their health care 
and in which services are furnished by residents under the medical 
direction of teaching physicians.
    (b) Nothing in paragraph (a) of this section may be construed as 
providing a basis for the coverage of services not determined to be 
covered under Medicare, such as routine physical checkups.

Sec. 415.176  Renal dialysis services.

    In the case of renal dialysis services, physicians who are not paid 
under the physician monthly capitation payment method (as described in 
Sec. 414.314 of this chapter) must meet the requirements of 
Secs. 415.170 and 415.172 (concerning physician fee schedule payment for 
services of teaching physicians).


<R05>
Sec. 415.178  Anesthesia services.

    (a) General rule. An unreduced physician fee schedule payment may be 
made if a physician is involved in a single anesthesia procedure 
involving an anesthesia resident. In the case of anesthesia services, 
the teaching physician must be present during all critical portions of 
the procedure and immediately available to furnish services during the 
entire service or procedure. The teaching physician cannot receive an 
unreduced fee if he or she performs services involving other patients 
during the period the anesthesia resident is furnishing services in a 
single case. For additional rules for payment of anesthesia services 
involving residents, see Sec. 414.46(c)(1)(iii)).
    (b) Documentation. Documentation must indicate the physician's 
presence or participation in the administration of the anesthesia.

<R05>
Sec. 415.180  Teaching setting requirements for the interpretation of diagnostic radiology and other diagnostic tests.

    (a) General rule. Physician fee schedule payment is made for the 
interpretation of diagnostic radiology and other diagnostic tests if the 
interpretation is performed or reviewed by a physician other than a 
resident.
    (b) Documentation. Documentation must indicate that the physician 
personally performed the interpretation or

[[Page 500]]

reviewed the resident's interpretation with the resident.


<R05>
Sec. 415.184  Psychiatric services.

    To qualify for physician fee schedule payment for psychiatric 
services furnished under an approved GME program, the physician must 
meet the requirements of Secs. 415.170 and 415.172, including 
documentation, except that the requirement for the presence of the 
teaching physician during the service in which a resident is involved 
may be met by observation of the service by use of a one-way mirror, 
video equipment, or similar device.


<R05>
Sec. 415.190  Conditions of payment: Assistants at surgery in teaching hospitals.

    (a) Basis, purpose, and scope. This section describes the conditions 
under which Medicare pays on a fee schedule basis for the services of an 
assistant at surgery in a teaching hospital. This section is based on 
section 1842(b)(7)(D)(I) of the Act and applies only to hospitals with 
an approved GME residency program. Except as specified in paragraph (c) 
of this section, fee schedule payment is not available for assistants at 
surgery in hospitals with--
    (1) A training program relating to the medical specialty required 
for the surgical procedure; and
    (2) A resident in a training program relating to the specialty 
required for the surgery available to serve as an assistant at surgery.
    (b) Definition. Assistant at surgery means a physician who actively 
assists the physician in charge of a case in performing a surgical 
procedure.
    (c) Conditions for payment for assistants at surgery. Payment on a 
fee schedule basis is made for the services of an assistant at surgery 
in a teaching hospital only if the services meet one of the following 
conditions:
    (1) Are required as a result of exceptional medical circumstances.
    (2) Are complex medical procedures performed by a team of 
physicians, each performing a discrete, unique function integral to the 
performance of a complex medical procedure that requires the special 
skills of more than one physician.
    (3) Constitute concurrent medical care relating to a medical 
condition that requires the presence of, and active care by, a physician 
of another specialty during surgery.
    (4) Are medically required and are furnished by a physician who is 
primarily engaged in the field of surgery, and the primary surgeon does 
not use interns and residents in the surgical procedures that the 
surgeon performs (including preoperative and postoperative care).
    (5) Are not related to a surgical procedure for which HCFA 
determines that assistants are used less than 5 percent of the time.


<R04>
                    Subpart E--Services of Residents


<R05>
Sec. 415.200  Services of residents in approved GME programs.

    (a) General rules. Services furnished in hospitals by residents in 
approved GME programs are specifically excluded from being paid as 
``physician services'' defined in Sec. 414.2 of this chapter and are 
payable as hospital services. This exclusion applies whether or not the 
resident is licensed to practice under the laws of the State in which he 
or she performs the service. The payment methodology for services of 
residents in hospitals and hospital-based providers is set forth in 
Sec. 413.86 of this chapter.
    (b) Exception. For low and mid-level evaluation and management 
services furnished under certain conditions in centers located in 
hospital outpatient departments and other ambulatory settings, see 
Sec. 415.174.
    (c) Definitions. See Sec. 415.152 for definitions of terms used in 
this subpart E.


<R05>
Sec. 415.202  Services of residents not in approved GME programs.

    (a) General rules. For services of a physician employed by a 
hospital who is authorized to practice only in a hospital setting and 
for the services of a resident who is not in any approved GME program, 
payment is made to the hospital on a Part B reasonable cost basis 
regardless of whether the services are furnished to hospital inpatients 
or outpatients.
    (b) Payment. For services described in paragraph (a) of this 
section, payment

[[Page 501]]

is made under Part B by reducing the reasonable costs of furnishing the 
services by the beneficiary deductible and paying 80 percent of the 
remaining amount. No payment is made for other costs of unapproved 
programs, such as administrative costs related to teaching activities of 
physicians.


<R05>
Sec. 415.204  Services of residents in skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies.

    (a) Medicare Part A payment. Payment is made under Medicare Part A 
for interns' and residents' services furnished in the following settings 
that meet the specified requirements:
    (1) Skilled nursing facility. Payment to a participating skilled 
nursing facility may include the cost of services of an intern or 
resident who is in an approved GME program in a hospital with which the 
skilled nursing facility has a transfer agreement that provides, in 
part, for the transfer of patients and the interchange of medical 
records.
    (2) Home health agency. A participating home health agency may 
receive payment for the cost of the services of an intern or resident 
who is under an approved GME program of a hospital with which the home 
health agency is affiliated or under common control if these services 
are furnished as part of the home health visits for a Medicare 
beneficiary. (Nevertheless, see Sec. 413.86 of this chapter for the 
costs of approved GME programs in hospital-based providers.)
    (b) Medicare Part B payment. Medical services of a resident of a 
hospital that are furnished by a skilled nursing facility or home health 
agency are paid under Medicare Part B if payment is not provided under 
Medicare Part A. Payment is made under Part B for a resident's services 
by reducing the reasonable costs of furnishing the services by the 
beneficiary deductible and paying 80 percent of the remaining amount.


<R05>
Sec. 415.206  Services of residents in nonprovider settings.

    Patient care activities of residents in approved GME programs that 
are furnished in nonprovider settings are payable in one of the 
following two ways:
    (a) Direct GME payments. If the conditions in Sec. 413.86(f)(1)(iii) 
regarding patient care activities and training of residents are met, the 
time residents spend in nonprovider settings such as clinics, nursing 
facilities, and physician offices in connection with approved GME 
programs is included in determining the number of full-time equivalency 
residents in the calculation of a teaching hospital's resident count. 
The teaching physician rules on carrier payments in Secs. 415.170 
through 415.184 apply in these teaching settings.
    (b) Physician fee schedule. (1) Services furnished by a resident in 
a nonprovider setting are covered as physician services and payable 
under the physician fee schedule if the following requirements are met:
    (i) The resident is fully licensed to practice medicine, osteopathy, 
dentistry, or podiatry in the State in which the service is performed.
    (ii) The time spent in patient care activities in the nonprovider 
setting is not included in a teaching hospital's full-time equivalency 
resident count for the purpose of direct GME payments.
    (2) Payment may be made regardless of whether a resident is 
functioning within the scope of his or her GME program in the 
nonprovider setting.
    (3) If fee schedule payment is made for the resident's services in a 
nonprovider setting, payment must not be made for the services of a 
teaching physician.
    (4) The carrier must apply the physician fee schedule payment rules 
set forth in subpart A of part 414 of this chapter to payments for 
services furnished by a resident in a nonprovider setting.


<R05>
Sec. 415.208  Services of moonlighting residents.

    (a) Definition. For purposes of this section, the term services of 
moonlighting residents refers to services that licensed residents 
perform that are outside the scope of an approved GME program.

[[Page 502]]

    (b) Services in GME program hospitals. (1) The services of residents 
to inpatients of hospitals in which the residents have their approved 
GME program are not covered as physician services and are payable under 
Sec. 413.86 regarding direct GME payments.
    (2) Services of residents that are not related to their approved GME 
programs and are performed in an outpatient department or emergency 
department of a hospital in which they have their training program are 
covered as physician services and payable under the physician fee 
schedule if all of the following criteria are met:
    (i) The services are identifiable physician services and meet the 
conditions for payment of physician services to beneficiaries in 
providers in Sec. 415.102(a).
    (ii) The resident is fully licensed to practice medicine, 
osteopathy, dentistry, or podiatry by the State in which the services 
are performed.
    (iii) The services performed can be separately identified from those 
services that are required as part of the approved GME program.
    (3) If the criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section 
are met, the services of the moonlighting resident are considered to 
have been furnished by the individual in his or her capacity as a 
physician, rather than in the capacity of a resident. The carrier must 
review the contracts and agreements for these services to ensure 
compliance with the criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (4) No payment is made for services of a ``teaching physician'' 
associated with moonlighting services, and the time spent furnishing 
these services is not included in the teaching hospital's full-time 
equivalency count for the indirect GME payment (Sec. 412.105 of this 
chapter) and for the direct GME payment (Sec. 413.86 of this chapter).
    (c) Other settings. Moonlighting services of a licensed resident in 
an approved GME program furnished outside the scope of that program in a 
hospital or other setting that does not participate in the approved GME 
program are payable under the physician fee schedule as set forth in 
Sec. 415.206(b)(1).

    (b) Limitation on charges to beneficiaries.<SUP>1</SUP> The ASC 
agrees to charge the beneficiary or any other person only the applicable 
deductible and coinsurance amounts for facility services for which the 
beneficiary--
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ For facility services furnished before July 1987, the ASC had to 
agree to make no charge to the beneficiary, since those services were 
not subject to the part B deductible and coinsurance provisions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) Is entitled to have payment made on his or her behalf under this 
part; or
    (2) Would have been so entitled if the ASC had filed a request for

    (1) The agreement is made effective on the first day of the next 
Medicare cost reporting period of the hospital that operates the ASC; 
and

has been removed; and
    (2) Is assured that the reason for the termination will not recur.

    (a) Hospital outpatient department. Payment is in accordance with 
part 413 of this chapter.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) ASC--(1) General rule. Payment is based on a prospectively 
determined rate. This rate covers the cost of services such as supplies,

health services payment.
    (c) To the extent that a natural disaster, war, riot, civil 
insurrection, epidemic or any other emergency or similar event not 
within the control of an HMO results in the facilities, personnel, or 
financial resources of an HMO being unavailable to provide or arrange 
for the provision of a basic or supplemental health service in 
accordance with the requirements of Secs. 417.101 through 417.106 and 
Secs. 417.168 and 417.169, the HMO is required only to make a good-faith 
effort to provide or arrange for the provision of the service, taking 
into account the impact of the event. For purposes of this paragraph, an

Sec. 417.102  Health benefits plan: Supplemental health services.

    (a) An HMO may provide to its enrollees any health service that is 
not included as a basic health service under Sec. 417.101(a). These 
health services may be limited as to time and cost.

<R05>
Sec. 417.103  Providers of basic and supplemental health services.

    (a)(1) The HMO must provide that the services of health 
professionals that are provided as basic health services will, except as 
provided in paragraph (c) of this section, be provided or arranged for 
through (i) health professionals who are staff of the HMO, (ii) a 
medical group or groups, (iii) an IPA or IPAs, (iv) physicians or other 
health professionals under direct service contracts with the HMO for the 
provision of these services, or (v) any combination of staff, medical 
group or groups, IPA or IPAs, or physicians or other health 
professionals under direct service contracts with the HMO.
    (2) A staff or medical group model HMO may have as providers of 
basic health services physicians who have also entered into written 
services arrangements with an IPA or IPAs, but only if either (i) these 
physicians number less than 50 percent of the physicians who have 
entered into arrangements with the IPA or IPAs, or (ii) if the sharing 
is 50 percent or greater, HCFA approves the sharing as being consistent 
with the purposes of section 1310(b) of the PHS Act.
    (3) After the 4 year period beginning with the month following the 
month in that an HMO becomes a qualified HMO, an entity that meets the 
requirements of the definition of medical group in Sec. 417.100, except 
for subdivision (3)(i) of that definition, may be considered a medical 
group if HCFA determines that the principal professional activity (over 
50 percent individually) of the entity's members is the coordinated 
practice of their profession, and if the HMO has demonstrated to the 
satisfaction of HCFA that the entity is committed to the delivery of 
medical services on a prepaid group practice basis by either:
    (i) Presenting a reasonable time-phased plan for the entity to 
achieve

[[Page 518]]

compliance with the ``substantial responsibility'' requirement of 
subdivision (3)(i) of the definition of ``medical group'' in 
Sec. 417.100. The HMO must update the plan annually and must demonstrate 
to the satisfaction of HCFA that the entity is making continuous efforts 
and progress towards compliance with the requirements of the definition 
of ``medical group,'' or
    (ii) Demonstrating that compliance by the entity with the 
``substantial responsibility'' requirement is unreasonable or 
impractical because (A) the HMO serves a non-metropolitan or rural area 
as defined in Sec. 417.100, or (B) the entity is a multi-speciality 
group that provides medical consultation upon referral on a regional or 
national basis, or (C) the majority of the residents of the HMO's 
service area are not eligible for employer-employee health benefits 
plans and the HMO has an insufficient number of enrollees to require 
utilization of at least 35 percent of the entity's services.
    (b) HMOs must have effective procedures to monitor utilization and 
to control cost of basic and supplemental health services and to achieve 
utilization goals, which may include mechanisms such as risk sharing, 
financial incentives, or other provisions agreed to by providers.
    (c) Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to the provision of 
the services of a physician:
    (1) Which the HMO determines are unusual or infrequently used 
services; or
    (2) Which, because of an emergency, it was medically necessary to 
provide to the enrollee other than as required by paragraph (a) of this 
section; or
    (3) Which are provided as part of the inpatient hospital services by 
employees or staff of a hospital or provided by staff of other entities 
such as community mental health centers, home health agencies, visiting 
nurses' associations, independent laboratories, or family planning 
agencies.
    (d) Supplemental health services must be provided or arranged for by 
the HMO and need not be provided by providers of basic health services 
under contract with the HMO.
    (e) Each HMO must:
    (1) Pay the provider, or reimburse its enrollees for the payment of 
reasonable charges for basic health services (or supplemental health 
services that the HMO agreed to provide on a prepayment basis) for which 
its enrollees have contracted, which were medically necessary and 
immediately required to be obtained other than through the HMO because 
of an unforeseen illness, injury, or condition, as determined by the 
HMO;
    (2) Adopt procedures to review promptly all claims from enrollees 
for reimbursement for the provision of health services described in 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section, including a procedure for the 
determination of the medical necessity for obtaining the services other 
than through the HMO; and
    (3) Provide instructions to its enrollees on procedures to be 
followed to secure these health services.

<R05>
Sec. 417.104  Payment for basic health services.

    (a) Basic health services payment. Each HMO must provide or arrange 
for the provision of basic health services for a basic health services 
payment that:
    (1) Is to be paid on a periodic basis without regard to the dates 
these services are provided;
    (2) Is fixed without regard to the frequency, extent, or kind of 
basic health services actually furnished;
    (3) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, is fixed 
under a community rating system, as described in paragraph (b) of this 
section; and
    (4) May be supplemented by nominal copayments which may be required 
for the provision of specific basic health services. Each HMO may 
establish one or more copayment options calculated on the basis of a 
community rating system.
    (i) An HMO may not impose copayment charges that exceed 50 percent 
of the total cost of providing any single

[[Page 519]]

service to its enrollees, nor in the aggregate more than 20 percent of 
the total cost of providing all basic health services.
    (ii) To insure that copayments are not a barrier to the utilization 
of health services or enrollment in the HMO, an HMO may not impose 
copayment charges on any subscriber (or enrollees covered by the 
subscriber's contract with the HMO) in any calendar year, when the 
copayments made by the subscriber (or enrollees) in that calendar year 
total 200 percent of the total annual premium cost which that subscriber 
(or enrollees) would be required to pay if he (or they) were enrolled 
under an option with no copayments. This limitation applies only if the 
subscriber (or enrollees) demonstrates that copayments in that amount 
have been paid in that year.
    (b) Community rating system. Under a community rating system, rates 
of payment for health services may be determined on a per person or per 
family basis, as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section or on a 
per group basis as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. An HMO 
may fix its rates of payment under the system described in paragraph 
(b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section or under both such systems, but an HMO 
may use only one such system for fixing its rates of payment for any one 
group.
    (1) A system of fixing rates of payment for health services may 
provide that the rates will be fixed on a per person or per family basis 
and may vary with the number of persons in a family. Except as otherwise 
authorized in this paragraph, these rates must be equivalent for all 
individuals and for all families of similar composition. Rates of 
payment may be based on either a schedule of rates charged to each 
subscriber group or on a per-enrollee-per-month (or per-subscriber-per-
month) revenue requirement for the HMO. In the former event, rates may 
vary from group to group if the projected total revenue from each group 
is substantially equivalent to the revenue that would be derived if the 
schedule of rates were uniform for all groups. In the latter event, the 
payments from each group of subscribers must be calculated to yield 
revenues substantially equivalent to the product of the total number of 
enrollees (or subscribers) expected to be enrolled from the group and 
the per-enrollee-per-month (or per-subscriber-per-month) revenue 
requirement for the HMO. Under the system described in this paragraph, 
rates of payment may not vary because of actual or anticipated 
utilization of services by individuals associated with any specific 
group of subscribers. These provisions do not preclude changes in the 
rates of payment that are established for new enrollments or re-
enrollments and that do not apply to existing contracts until the 
renewal of these contracts.
    (2) A system of fixing rates of payment for health services may 
provide that the rates will be fixed for individuals and families by 
groups. Except as otherwise authorized in this paragraph, such rates 
must be equivalent for all individuals in the same group and for all 
families of similar composition in the same group. If an HMO is to fix 
rates of payment for individuals and families by groups, it must:
    (i) Classify all of the enrollees of the organization into classes 
based on factors that the HMO determines predict the differences in the 
use of health services by the individuals or families in each class and 
which have not been disapproved by HCFA,
    (ii) Determine its revenue requirements for providing services to 
the enrollees of each class established under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of 
this section, and
    (iii) Fix the rates of payment for the individuals and families of a 
group on the basis of a composite of the organization's revenue 
requirements determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section for 
providing services to them as members of the classes established under 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. HCFA will review the factors used 
by each HMO to establish classes under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this 
section. If HCFA determines that any such factor may not reasonably be 
used to predict the use of the health services by individuals and 
families, HCFA will disapprove the factor for that purpose.
    (3)(i) Nominal differentials in rates may be established to reflect 
differences in marketing costs and the

[[Page 520]]

different administrative costs of collecting payments from the following 
categories of potential subscribers:
    (A) Individual (non-group) subscribers (including their families).
    (B) Small groups of subscribers (100 subscribers or fewer).
    (C) Large groups of subscribers (over 100 subscribers).
    (ii) Differentials in rates may be established for subscribers 
enrolled in an HMO: (A) Under a contract with a governmental authority 
under section 1079 (``Contracts for Medical Care for Spouses and 
Children: Plans'') or section 1086 (``Contracts for Health Benefits for 
Certain Members, Former Members and their Dependents'') of title 10 
(``Armed Forces''), United States Code; or (B) under any other 
governmental program (other than the health benefits program authorized 
by chapter 89 (``Health Insurance'') of title 5 (``Government 
Organization and Employees''), United States Code; or (C) under any 
health benefits program for employees of States, political subdivisions 
of states, and other public entities.
    (4) An HMO may establish a separate community rate for separate 
regional components of the organization upon satisfactory demonstration 
to HCFA of the following:
    (i) Each regional component is geographically distinct and separate 
from any other regional component; and
    (ii) Each regional component provides substantially the full range 
of basic health services to its enrollees, without extensive referral 
between components of the organization for these services, and without 
substantial utilization by any two components of the same health care 
facilities. The separate community rate for each regional component of 
the HMO must be based on the different costs of providing health 
services in the respective regions.
    (c) Exceptions to community rating requirement. (1) In the case of 
an HMO that provided comprehensive health services on a prepaid basis 
before it became a qualifed HMO, the requirement of community rating 
shall not apply to the HMO during the forty-eight month period beginning 
with the month following the month in which it became a qualifed HMO.
    (2) The requirement of community rating does not apply to the basic 
health services payment for basic health services provided an enrollee 
who is a full-time student at an accredited institution of higher 
education.
    (d) Late payment penalty. HMOs may charge a late payment penalty on 
accounts receivable that are in arrears.
    (e) Review procedures for evaluating the community rating by class 
system under paragraph (b)(2).<SUP>1</SUP> An HMO may establish a 
community rating system under paragraph (b)(2) of this section or 
revised factors used to establish classes after it receives written 
approval of the factors from HCFA. HCFA will give approval if it 
concludes that the factors can reasonably be used to predict the use of 
health services by individuals and families.

    (1) An HMO must make a written request to HCFA, listing the factors 
to be used in the community rating by class system under paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section.
    (2) HCFA will notify each HMO within 30 days of receipt of the 
request and application of one of the following:
    (i) The application is approved;
    (ii) Additional information or data are required and HCFA will 
notify the HMO of its decision within 30 days from the date of receipt 
of this information or data; or
    (iii) HCFA needs additional time to review the written request and 
the HMO will be notified of HCFA's decision within 90 days.

Sec. 417.105  Payment for supplemental health services.

    (a) An HMO may require supplemental health services payments, in 
addition to the basic health services payments, for the provision of 
each health service included in the supplemental health services set 
forth in Sec. 417.102 for which subscribers have contracted, or it may 
include supplemental health services in the basic health services 
provided its enrollees for a basic health services payment.
    (b) Supplemental health services payments may be made in any agreed 
upon manner, such as prepayment or fee-for-service. Supplemental health 
services payments that are fixed on a prepayment basis, however, must be 
fixed under a community rating system, unless the supplemental health 
services payment is for a supplemental health service provided an 
enrollee who is a full-time student at an accredited institution of 
higher education. In the case of an HMO that provided comprehensive 
health services on a prepaid basis before it became a qualifed HMO, the 
community rating requirement shall not apply to that HMO during the 
forty-eight month period beginning with the month following the month in 
which it became a qualifed HMO.

Sec. 417.106  Quality assurance program; Availability, accessibility, and continuity of basic and supplemental health services.

    (a) Quality assurance program. Each HMO or CMP must have an ongoing 
quality assurance program for its health services that meets the 
following conditions:
    (1) Stresses health outcomes to the extent consistent with the state 
of the art.
    (2) Provides review by physicians and other health professionals of 
the process followed in the provision of health services.
    (3) Uses systematic data collection of performance and patient 
results, provides interpretation of these data to its practitioners, and 
institutes needed change.
    (4) Includes written procedures for taking appropriate remedial 
action whenever, as determined under the quality assurance program, 
inappropriate or substandard services have been provided or services 
that ought to have been furnished have not been provided.
    (b) Availability and accessibility of health care services. Basic 
health services and those supplemental health services for which 
enrollees have contracted must be provided or arranged for by the HMO in 
accordance with the following rules:
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the 
services must be available to each enrollee within the HMO's service 
area.
    (2) Exception. If the HMO's service area is located wholly within a 
nonmetropolitan area, the HMO may make available outside its service 
area any basic health service that is not a primary care or emergency 
care service, if the number of providers of that basic health service 
who will provide the service to the HMO's enrollees is insufficient to 
meet the demand. As used in this paragraph, primary care includes 
general practice, family practice, general internal medicine, general 
pediatrics, and general obstetrics and gynecology. An HMO that provides 
the services covered by these fields through at least a general or 
family practitioner, or a pediatrician and a general internist, is 
considered to be providing primary care.
    (3) The services must be available and accessible with reasonable 
promptness to each of the HMO's enrollees as ensured through--
    (i) Staffing patterns within generally accepted norms for meeting 
the projected enrollment needs; and
    (ii) Geographic location, hours of operation, and arrangements for 
after-hours services. (Medically necessary emergency services must be 
available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.)
    (c) Continuity of care. The HMO must ensure continuity or care 
through arrangements that include but are not limited to the following:

[[Page 522]]

    (1) Use of a health professional who is primarily responsible for 
coordinating the enrollee's overall health care.
    (2) A system of health and medical records that accumulates 
pertinent information about the enrollee's health care and makes it 
available to appropriate professionals.
    (3) Arrangements made directly or through the HMO's providers to 
ensure that the HMO or the health professional who coordinates the 
enrollee's overall health care is kept informed about the services that 
the referral resources furnish to the enrollee.
    (d) Confidentiality of health records. Each HMO must establish 
adequate procedures to ensure the confidentiality of the health and 
medical records of its enrollees.

    (a) Fiscally sound operation--(1) General requirements. Each HMO 
must have a fiscally sound operation, as demonstrated by the following:
    (i) Total assets greater than total unsubordinated liabilities. In 
evaluating assets and liabilities, loan funds awarded or guaranteed 
under section 1306 of the PHS Act are not included as liabilities.
    (ii) Sufficient cash flow and adequate liquidity to meet obligations 
as they become due.
    (iii) A net operating surplus, or a financial plan that meets the 
requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (iv) An insolvency protection plan that meets the requirements of 
Sec. 417.122(b) for protection of enrollees.
    (v) A fidelity bond or bonds, procured and maintained by the HMO, in 
an amount fixed by its policymaking body but not less than $100,000 per 
individual, covering each officer and employee entrusted with the 
handling of its funds. The bond may have reasonable deductibles, based 
upon the financial strength of the HMO.
    (vi) Insurance policies or other arrangements, secured and 
maintained by the HMO and approved by HCFA to insure the HMO against 
losses arising from professional liability claims, fire, theft, fraud, 
embezzlement, and other casualty risks.
    (2) Financial plan requirement. (i) If an HMO has not earned a 
cumulative net operating surplus during the three most recent fiscal 
years, did not earn a net operating surplus during the most recent 
fiscal year or does not have positive net worth, the HMO must submit a 
financial plan satisfactory to HCFA to achieve net operating surplus 
within available fiscal resources.
    (ii) This plan must include--
    (A) A detailed marketing plan;
    (B) Statements of revenue and expense on an accrual basis;
    (C) Sources and uses of funds statements; and
    (D) Balance sheets.
    (b) Assumption of financial risk. Each HMO must assume full 
financial risk on a prospective basis for the provision of basic health 
services, except that it may obtain insurance or make other arrangements 
as follows:
    (1) For the cost of providing to any enrollee basic health services 
with an aggregate value of more than $5,000 in any year.
    (2) For the cost of basic health services obtained by its enrollees 
from sources other than the HMO because medical necessity required that 
they be furnished before they could be secured through the HMO.
    (3) For not more than 90 percent of the amount by which its costs 
for any of its fiscal years exceed 115 percent of its income for that 
fiscal year.
    (4) For physicians or other health professionals, health care 
institutions, or any other combination of such individuals or 
institutions to assume all or part of the financial risk on a 
prospective basis for their furnishing of basic health services to the 
HMO's enrollees.


<R05>
Sec. 417.122  Protection of enrollees.

    (a) Liability protection. (1) Each HMO must adopt and maintain 
arrangements satisfactory to HCFA to protect its enrollees from 
incurring liability

[[Page 523]]

for payment of any fees that are the legal obligation of the HMO. These 
arrangements may include any of the following:
    (i) Contractual arrangements that prohibit health care providers 
used by the enrollees from holding any enrollee liable for payment of 
any fees that are the legal obligation of the HMO.
    (ii) Insurance, acceptable to HCFA.
    (iii) Financial reserves, acceptable to HCFA, that are held for the 
HMO and restricted for use only in the event of insolvency.
    (iv) Any other arrangements acceptable to HCFA.
    (2) The requirements of this paragraph do not apply to an HMO if

    (a) General requirements. Each HMO must have administrative and 
managerial arrangements satisfactory to HCFA, as demonstrated by at 
least the following:
    (1) A policymaking body that exercises oversight and control over

in the best interest of the HMO and its enrollees.
    (2) Personnel and systems sufficient for the HMO to organize, plan, 
control and evaluate the financial, marketing, health services, quality 
assurance program, administrative and management aspects of the HMO.
    (3) At a minimum, management by an executive whose appointment and 
removal are under the control of the HMO's policymaking body.
    (b) Full and fair disclosure--(1) Basic rule. Each HMO must prepare 
a written description of the following:

    (ii) Coverage (including a statement of conditions on eligibility 
for benefits).
    (iii) Procedures to be followed in obtaining benefits and a 
description of circumstances under which benefits may be denied.
    (iv) Rates.
    (v) Grievance procedures.
    (vi) Service area.
    (vii) Participating providers.
    (viii) Financial condition including at least the following most

HMO or to whom the opportunity for enrollment is offered.
    (iii) The HMO must provide the description to any enrollee or person 
who is eligible to elect the HMO option and who requests the material 
from the HMO or the administrator of a health benefits plan. For 
purposes of this requirement, ``administrator'' (of a health benefits 
plan) has the meaning it is given in the Employment Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) at 29 U.S.C. 1002(16)(A).
    (iv) If the HMO provides health services through individual practice 
associations (IPAs), the HMO must specify the number of member

receive basic and supplemental health services.
    (c) Broadly representative enrollment. (1) Each HMO must offer 
enrollment to persons who are broadly representative of the various age, 
social, and income groups within its service area.
    (2) If an HMO has a medically underserved population located in its 
service area, not more than 75 percent of its enrollees may be from the 
medically underserved population unless the area in which that 
population resides is a rural area.
    (d) Health status and enrollment. (1) The HMO may not, on the basis 
of health status, health care needs, or age of the individual--
    (i) Expel or refuse to reenroll any enrollee; or
    (ii) Refuse to enroll individual members of a group.
    (2) For purposes of this paragraph, a ``group'' is composed of 
individuals who enroll in the HMO under a contract or other arrangement 
that covers two or more subscribers. Examples of groups are employees 
who enroll under a contract between their employer and the HMO, or 
members of an organization that arranges coverage for its membership.
    (3) Nothing in this subpart prohibits an HMO from requiring that, as 
a condition for continued eligibility for enrollment, enrolled dependent 
children, upon reaching a specified age, convert to individual 
enrollment, consistent with paragraph (e) of this section.
    (e) Conversion of enrollment. (1) Each HMO must offer individual 
enrollment to the following:
    (i) Each enrollee (and his or her enrolled dependents) leaving a

conditions that it makes available to other nongroup enrollees.
    (f) [Reserved]
    (g) Grievance procedures. Each HMO must have and use meaningful 
procedures for hearing and resolving grievances between the HMO's 
enrollees and the HMO, including the HMO staff and medical groups and 
IPAs that furnish services. These procedures must ensure that:
    (1) Grievances and complaints are transmitted in a timely manner to 
appropriate HMO decisionmaking levels that have authority to take 
corrective action; and
    (2) Appropriate action is taken promptly, including a full 
investigation if necessary and notification of concerned parties as to 
the results of the HMO's investigation.
    (h) Certification of institutional providers. Each HMO must ensure 
that its affiliated institutional providers meet one of the following 
conditions:
    (1) In the case of hospitals, are either accredited by the Joint 
Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations, or certified 
by Medicare.
    (2) In the case of laboratories, are either CLIA-exempt, or have in

Act and implementing regulations in this subpart D and in subparts B and 
C of this part.
    (h) Special rules: Enrollees under the Federal employee health 
benefits program (FEHBP). An HMO that accepts enrollees under the FEHBP 
(Chapter 89 of title 5 of the U.S.C.) may obtain and retain Federal

requirements of section 1301(b) and 1301(c) of the PHS Act and 
implementing regulations in this subpart D and subparts B and C of this 
part.

<R05>
Sec. 417.143  Application requirements.

    (a) General requirements. This section sets forth application 
requirements for entities that seek qualification as HMOs; HMOs that 
seek expansion of their service areas; and HMOs that seek qualification 
of their regional components as HMOs.
    (b) Completion of an application form. (1) In order to receive a 
determination concerning whether an entity is a qualified HMO, an 
individual authorized to act for the entity (the applicant) must 
complete an application form provided by HCFA.
    (2) The authorized individual must describe thoroughly how the 
entity meets, or will meet, the requirements for qualified HMOs 
described in the PHS Act and in subparts B and C of this part, this 
subpart D, and 417.168 and 417.169 of subpart F.
    (c) Collection of an application fee. In accordance with the 
requirements of 31 U.S.C. 9701, Fees and charges for Government services 
and things of value, HCFA determines the amount of the application fee 
that must be submitted with each type of application.
    (1) The fee is reasonably related to the Federal government's cost 
of qualifying an entity and may vary based on the type of application.
    (2) Each type of application has one set fee rather than a charge 
based on the specific cost of each determination. (For example, each 
Federally qualified HMO applicant seeking Federal qualification of one 
of its regional components as an HMO is charged the same amount, unless 
the amount of the fee has been changed under paragraph (f) of this 
section.)
    (d) Application fee amounts. The application fee amounts for 
applications completed on or after July 13, 1987 are as follows:

[[Page 529]]

    (1) $18,400 for an entity seeking qualification as an HMO or 
qualification of a regional component of an HMO.

If, in the case of an HMO seeking qualification of a regional component, 
HCFA determines that there is no need for a site visit, $8,000 will be 
returned to the applicant.
    (2) $6,900 for an HMO seeking expansion of its service area.
    (3) $3,100 for a CMP seeking qualification as an HMO.
    (e) Refund of an application fee. HCFA refunds an application fee 
only if the entity withdraws its application within 10 working days 
after receipt by HCFA. Application fees are not returned in any other 
circumstance, even if qualification or certification is denied.
    (f) Procedure for changing the amount of an application fee. If HCFA 
determines that a change in the amount of a fee is appropriate, HCFA 
issues a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register to 
announce the proposed new amount.
    (g) New application after denial. An entity may not submit another 
application under this subpart for the same type of determination for 
four full months after the date of the notice in which HCFA denied the 
application.
    (h) Disclosure of application information under the Freedom of 
Information Act. An applicant submitting material that he or she 
believes is protected from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552, the Freedom of 
Information Act, or because of exceptions provided in 45 CFR part 5, the 
Department's regulations providing exceptions to disclosure, should 
label the material ``privileged'' and include an explanation of the 
applicability of an exception described in 45 CFR part 5.

Sec. 417.144  Evaluation and determination procedures.

    (a) Basis for evaluation and determination. (1) HCFA evaluates an 
application for Federal qualification on the basis of information 
contained in the application itself and any additional information that 
HCFA obtains through on-site visits, public hearings, and any other 
appropriate procedures.
    (2) If the application is incomplete, HCFA notifies the entity and 
allows 60 days from the date of the notice for the entity to furnish the 
missing information.
    (3) After evaluating all relevant information, HCFA determines 
whether the entity meets the applicable requirements of Secs. 417.142 
and 417.143.
    (b) Notice of determination. HCFA notifies each entity that applies 
for qualification under this subpart of its determination and the basis 
for the determination. The determination may be granting of 
qualification, intent to deny, or denial.
    (c) Intent to deny. (1) If HCFA finds that the entity does not 
appear to meet the requirements for qualification and appears to be able 
to meet those requirements within 60 days, HCFA gives the entity notice 
of intent to deny qualification and a summary of the basis for this 
preliminary finding.
    (2) Within 60 days from the date of the notice, the entity may 
respond in writing to the issues or other matters that were the basis 
for HCFA's preliminary finding, and may revise its application to remedy 
any defects identified by HCFA.
    (d) Denial and reconsideration of denial. (1) If HCFA denies an 
application for qualification under this subpart, HCFA gives the entity 
written notice of the denial and an opportunity to request 
reconsideration of that determination.
    (2) A request for reconsideration must--
    (i) Be submitted in writing, within 60 days following the date of 
the notice of denial;
    (ii) Be addressed to the HCFA officer or employee who denied the 
application; and
    (iii) Set forth the grounds upon which the entity requests 
reconsideration, specifying the material issues of fact and of law upon 
which the entity relies.
    (3) HCFA bases its reconsideration upon the record compiled during 
the qualification review proceedings, materials submitted in support of 
the request for reconsideration, and other relevant materials available 
to HCFA.

[[Page 530]]

    (4) HCFA gives the entity written notice of the reconsidered 
determination and the basis for the determination.
    (e) Information on qualified HMOs--(1) Federal Register notices. In 
quarterly Federal Register notices, HCFA gives the names, addresses, and 
service areas of newly qualified HMOs and describes the expanded service 
areas of other qualified HMOs.
    (2) Listings. A cumulative list of qualified HMOs is available from 
the following office, which is open from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday 
through Friday: Office of Managed Care, room 4360, Cohen Building, 400

<R05>
Sec. 417.151  Applicability.

    (a) Basic rule. Effective October 24, 1995 <SUP>1</SUP>, this 
subpart applies to any employing entity that offers a health benefits 
plan to its employees, meets the conditions specified in paragraphs (b) 
through (e) of this section, and elects to include one or more qualified 
HMOs in the health plan alternatives it offers its employees.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\  Before October 24, 1995, an employing entity that met the 
conditions specified in Sec. 417.151 was required to include one or more 
qualified HMOs, if it received from at least one qualified HMO a written 
request for inclusion and that request met the timing, content, and 
procedural requirements specified in Sec. 417.152.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Number of employees. During any calendar quarter of the 
preceding calendar year, the employer or public entity employed an 
average of not less than 25 employees.
    (c) Minimum wage. During any calendar quarter of the preceding 
calendar year, the employer was required to pay the minimum wage 
specified in section 6 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, or would 
have been required to pay that wage but for section 13(a) of that Act.
    (d) Federal assistance under section 317 of the PHS Act. The public 
entity has a pending application for, or is receiving, assistance under 
section 317 of the PHS Act.
    (e) Employees in HMO's service area. At least 25 of the employing 
entity's employees reside within the HMO's service area.

[59 FR 49838, Sept. 30, 1994, as amended at 61 FR 27287, May 31, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 417.153  Offer of HMO alternative.

    (a) Basic rule. An employing entity that is subject to this subpart 
and that elects to include one or more qualified HMOs must offer the HMO 
alternative in accordance with this section.
    (b) Employees to whom the HMO option must be offered. Each employing 
entity must offer the option of enrollment in a qualified HMO to each 
eligible employee and his or her eligible dependents who reside in the 
HMO's service area.

[[Page 532]]

    (c) Manner of offering the HMO option. (1) For employees who are 
represented by a bargaining representative, the option of enrollment in 
a qualified HMO--
    (i) Must first be presented to the bargaining representative; and
    (ii) If the representative accepts the option, must then be offered 
to each represented employee.
    (2) For employees not represented by a bargaining representative, 
the option must be offered directly to those employees.

[59 FR 49839, Sept. 30, 1994, as amended at 61 FR 27287, May 31, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 417.155  How the HMO option must be included in the health benefits plan.

    (a) HMO access to employees--(1) Purpose and timing.
    (i) Purpose. The employing entity must provide each HMO included in 
its health benefits plan fair and reasonable access to all employees 
specified in Sec. 417.153(b), so that the HMO can explain its program in 
accordance with Sec. 417.124(b).
    (ii) Timing. The employing entity must provide access beginning at 
least 30 days before, and continuing during, the group enrollment 
period.
    (2) Nature of access. (i) Access must include, at a minimum, 
opportunity to distribute educational literature, brochures, 
announcements of meetings, and other relevant printed materials that 
meet the requirements of Sec. 417.124(b).
    (ii) Access may not be more restrictive or less favorable than the 
access the employing entity provides to other offerors of options 
included in the health benefits plan, whether or not those offerors 
elect to avail themselves of that access.
    (b) Review of HMO offering materials. (1) The HMO must give the 
employing entity or designee opportunity to review, revise, and approve 
HMO educational and offering materials before distribution.
    (2) Revisions must be limited to correcting factual errors and 
misleading or ambiguous statements, unless--
    (i) The HMO and the employing entity agree otherwise; or
    (ii) Other revisions are required by law.
    (3) The employing entity or designee must complete revision of the 
materials promptly so as not to delay or otherwise interfere with their 
use during the group enrollment period.
    (c) Group enrollment period; prohibition of restrictions; effective 
date of HMO coverage--(1) Prohibition of restrictions. If an employing 
entity or designee includes the option of enrollment in a qualified HMO 
in the health benefits plan offered to its eligible employees, it must 
provide a group enrollment period before the effective date of HMO 
coverage. The employing entity may not impose waiting periods as a 
condition of enrollment in the HMO or of transfer from HMO to non-HMO 
coverage, or exclusions, or limitations based on health status.
    (2) Effective date of coverage. Unless otherwise agreed to by the 
employing entity, or designee, and the HMO, coverage under the HMO 
contract for employees selecting the HMO option begins on the day the 
non-HMO contract expires or is renewed without lapse.
    (3) Coordination of benefits. Nothing in this subpart precludes the 
uniform application of coordination of benefits agreements between the 
HMOs and the other carriers that are included in the health benefits 
plan.
    (d) Continued eligibility for ``free-standing'' health benefits--(1) 
Basic requirement. At the request of a qualified HMO, the employing 
entity or its designee must provide that employees selecting the option 
of HMO membership will not, because of this selection, lose their 
eligibility for free-standing dental, optical, or prescription drug 
benefits for which they were previously eligible or would be eligible if 
selecting a non-HMO option and that are not included in the services 
provided by the HMO to its enrollees as part of the HMO prepaid benefit 
package.
    (2) ``Free-standing'' defined. For purposes of this paragraph, the 
term ``free-standing'' refers to a benefit that--
    (i) Is not integrated or incorporated into a basic health benefits 
package or major medical plan, and
    (ii) Is--
    (A) Offered by a carrier other than the one offering the basic 
health benefits package or major medical plan; or

[[Page 533]]

    (B) Subject to a premium separate from the premium for the basic 
health benefits package or major medical plan.
    (3) Examples of the employing entity's obligation with respect to 
the continued eligibility. (i) The health benefits plan includes a free-
standing dental benefit. The HMO does not offer any dental coverage as 
part of its health services provided to members on a prepaid basis. The 
employing entity must provide that employees who select the HMO option 
continue to be eligible for dental coverage. (If the dental coverage is 
not optional for employees selecting the non-HMO option, nothing in this 
regulation requires that the coverage be made optional for employees 
selecting the HMO option. Conversely, if this coverage is optional for 
employees selecting the non-HMO option, nothing in this regulation 
requires that the coverage be mandatory for employees selecting the non-
HMO option.) -
    (ii) The non-HMO option provides free-standing coverage for optical 
services (such as refraction and the provision of eyeglasses), and the 
HMO does not. The employing entity must provide that employees who 
select the HMO option continue to be eligible for optical coverage.
    (iii) The non-HMO option includes dental coverage in its major 
medical package, with a common deductible applied to dental as well as 
non-dental benefits. The HMO provides no dental coverage as part of its 
pre-paid health services. Because the dental coverage is not free-
standing, the employing entity is not required to provide that employees 
who select the HMO option continue to be eligible for dental coverage, 
but is free to do so.
    (e) Opportunity to select among coverage options: Requirement for 
affirmative written selection--(1) Opportunity other than during a group 
enrollment period. The employing entity or designee must provide 
opportunity (in addition to the group enrollment period) for selection 
among coverage options, by eligible employees who meet any of the 
following conditions:
    (i) Are new employees.
    (ii) Have been transferred or have changed their place of residence, 
resulting in--
    (A) Eligibility for enrollment in a qualified HMO for which they 
were not previously eligible by place of residence; or
    (B) Residence outside the service area of a qualified HMO in which 
they were previously enrolled.
    (iii) Are covered by any coverage option that ceases operation.
    (2) Prohibition of restrictions. When the employees specified in 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section are eligible to participate in the 
health benefits plan, the employing entity or designee must make 
available, without waiting periods or exclusions based on health status 
as a condition, the opportunity to enroll in an HMO, or transfer from 
HMO coverage to non-HMO coverage.
    (3) Affirmative written selection. The employing entity or designee 
must require that the eligible employee make an affirmative written 
selection in any of the following circumstances:
    (i) Enrollment in a particular qualified HMO is offered for the 
first time.
    (ii) The eligible employee elects to change from one option to 
another.
    (iii) The eligible employee is one of those specified in paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section.
    (f) Determination of copayment levels and supplemental health 
services. The selection of a copayment level and of supplemental health 
services to be contracted for must be made as follows:
    (1) For employees represented by a collective bargaining 
representative, the selection of copayment levels and supplemental 
health services is subject to the collective bargaining process.
    (2) For employees not represented by a bargaining representative, 
the selection of copayment levels and supplemental health services is 
subject to the same decisionmaking process used by the employing entity 
with respect to the non-HMO option in its health benefits plan.
    (3) In all cases, the HMO has the right to include, with the basic 
benefits package it provides to its enrollees for a basic health 
services payment, on a non-negotiable basis, those supplemental health 
services that meet the following conditions:
    (i) Are required to be offered under State law.

[[Page 534]]

    (ii) Are included uniformly by the HMO in its prepaid benefit 
package.
    (iii) Are available to employees who select the non-HMO option but 
not available to those who select the HMO option.

[59 FR 49840, Sept. 30, 1994, as amended at 61 FR 27288, May 31, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 417.156  When the HMO must be offered to employees.

    (a) General rules. (1) The employing entity or designee must offer 
eligible employees the option of enrollment in a qualified HMO at the 
earliest date permitted under the terms of existing agreements or 
contracts.
    (2) If the HMO's request for inclusion in a health benefits plan is 
received at a time when existing contracts or agreements do not provide 
for inclusion, the employing entity must include the HMO option in the 
health benefits plan at the time that new agreements or contracts are 
offered or negotiated.
    (b) Specific requirements. Unless mutually agreed otherwise, the 
following rules apply:
    (1) Collective bargaining agreement. The employing entity or 
designee must raise the HMO's request during the collective bargaining 
process--
    (i) When a new agreement is negotiated;
    (ii) At the time prescribed, in an agreement with a fixed term of 
more than 1 year, for discussion of change in health benefits; or
    (iii) In accordance with a specific process for review of HMO 
offers.
    (2) Contracts. For employees not covered by a collective bargaining 
agreement, the employing entity or designee must include the HMO option 
in any health benefits plan offered to eligible employees when the 
existing contract is renewed or when a new health benefits contract or 
other arrangement is negotiated.
    (i) If a contract has no fixed term or has a term in excess of 1 
year, the contract must be treated as renewable on its earliest 
anniversary date.
    (ii) If the employing entity or designee is self-insured, the budget 
year must be treated as the term of the existing contract.
    (3) Multiple arrangements. In the case of a health benefits plan 
that includes multiple contracts or other arrangements with varying 
expiration or renewal dates, the employing entity must include the HMO 
option, in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this 
section,--
    (i) At the time each contract or arrangement is renewed or reissued; 
or
    (ii) The benefits provided under the contract or arrangement are 
offered to employees.

[59 FR 49841, Sept. 30, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 417.157  Contributions for the HMO alternative.

    (a) General principles--(1) Nondiscrimination. The employer 
contribution to an HMO must be in an amount that does not discriminate 
financially against an employee who enrolls in an HMO. A contribution 
does not discriminate financially if the method of determining the 
contribution is reasonable and is designed to ensure that employees have 
a fair choice among health benefits plan alternatives.
    (2) Effect of agreements or contracts. The employing entity or 
designee is not required to pay more for health benefits as a result of 
offering the HMO alternative than it would otherwise be required to pay 
under a collective bargaining agreement or contract that provides for 
health benefits and is in effect at the time the HMO alternative is 
included.
    (3) Examples of acceptable employer contributions. The following are 
methods that are considered nondiscriminatory:
    (i) The employer contribution to the HMO is the same, per employee, 
as the contribution to non-HMO alternatives.
    (ii) The employer contribution reflects the composition of the HMO's 
enrollment in terms of enrollee attributes that can reasonably be used 
to predict utilization, experience, costs, or risk. For each enrollee in 
a given class established on the basis of those attributes, the employer 
contributes an equal amount, regardless of the health benefits plan 
chosen by the employee.
    (iii) The employer contribution is a fixed percentage of the premium 
for each of the alternatives offered.

[[Page 535]]

    (iv) The employer contribution is determined under a mutually 
acceptable arrangement negotiated by the HMO and the employer. In 
negotiating the arrangement, the employer may not insist on terms that 
would cause the HMO to violate any of the requirements of this part.
    (4) Adjustment of employer contribution. An employer contribution 
determined by an acceptable method may in some cases be adjusted if it 
would result in a nominal payment or no payment at all by HMO enrollees 
(because the HMO premium is lower than the premiums for the other 
alternatives offered). If, for example the employer has a policy of 
requiring all employees to contribute to their health benefits plan, the 
employer may require HMO enrollees who would otherwise pay little or 
nothing at all, to make a payment that does not exceed 50 percent of the 
employee contribution to the principal non-HMO alternative. The 
principal non-HMO alternative is the one that covers the largest number 
of enrollees from the particular employer.
    (b) Administrative expenses. (1) In determining the amount of its 
contribution to the HMO, the employing entity or designee may not 
consider administrative expenses incurred in connection with offering 
any alternative in the health benefits plan.
    (2) However, if the employing entity or designee has special 
requirements for other than standard solicitation brochures and 
enrollment literature, it must, in the case of the HMO alternative, 
determine and distribute any administrative costs attributable to those 
requirements in a manner consistent with its method of determining and 
distributing those costs for the non-HMO alternatives.
    (c) Exclusion for contribution for certain benefits. In determining 
the amount of the employing entity's contribution or the designee's cost 
for the HMO alternative, the employing entity or designee may exclude 
those portions of the contribution allocable to benefits (such as life 
insurance or insurance for supplemental health benefits)--
    (1) For which eligible employees and their eligible dependents are 
covered notwithstanding selection of the HMO alternative; and
    (2) That are not offered on a prepayment basis by the HMO to the 
employing entity's employees.
    (d) Contributions determined by agreements or contracts or by law. 
If the specific amount of the employing entity's contribution for health 
benefits is fixed by an agreement or contract, or by law, that amount 
constitutes the employing entity's obligation for contribution toward 
the HMO premiums.
    (e) Allocation of portion of a contribution determined by an 
agreement. In some cases, the employing entity's contribution for health 
benefits is determined by an agreement that also provides for benefits 
other than health benefits. In that case, the employing entity must 
determine, or instruct its designee to determine, what portion of its 
contribution is applicable to health benefits.
    (f) Retention and availability of data. Each employing entity or 
designee must retain the following data for three years and make it 
available to HCFA upon request:
    (1) The data used to compute the level of contribution for each of 
the plans offered to employees.
    (2) Related data about the employees who are eligible to enroll in a 
plan.
    (3) A description of the methodology for computation.
    (g) HCFA review of data. (1) HCFA may request and review the data 
specified in paragraph (f) of this section on its own initiative or in 
response to requests from HMOs or employees.
    (2) The purpose of HCFA's review is to determine whether the 
methodology and the level of contribution comply with the requirements 
of this subpart.
    (3) HMOs and employees that request HCFA to review must set forth 
reasonable grounds for making the request.

<R05>
Sec. 417.158  Payroll deductions.

    Each employing entity that provides payroll deductions as a means of 
paying employees' contributions for health benefits or provides a health 
benefits plan that does not require an employee contribution must, with 
the consent of

[[Page 536]]

an employee who selects the HMO option, arrange for the employee's 
contribution, if any, to be paid through payroll deductions.

Sec. 417.159  Relationship of section 1310 of the Public Health Service Act to the National Labor Relations Act and the Railway Labor Act.

    The decision of an employing entity subject to this subpart to 
include the HMO alternative in any health benefits plan offered to its 
eligible employees must be carried out consistently with the obligations 
imposed on that employing entity under the National Labor Relations Act, 
the Railway Labor Act, and other laws of similar effect.

<R05>
Sec. 417.163  Enforcement procedures.

    (a) Complaints. Any person, group, association, corporation, or 
other entity may file with HCFA a written complaint with respect to an 
HMO's compliance with assurances it gave under subpart D of this part. A 
complaint must--
    (1) State the grounds and underlying facts of the complaint;
    (2) Give the names of all persons involved; and
    (3) Assure that all appropriate grievance and appeals procedures 
established by the HMO and available to the complainant have been 
exhausted.
    (b) Investigations. (1) HCFA may initiate investigations when, based 
on a report, a complaint, or any other information, HCFA has reason to 
believe that a Federally qualified HMO is not in compliance with any of 
the assurances it gave under subpart D of this part.
    (2) When HCFA initiates an investigation, it gives the HMO written 
notice that includes a full statement of the pertinent facts and of the 
matters being investigated and indicates that the HMO may submit, within 
30 days of the date of the notice, a written report concerning these 
matters.
    (3) HCFA obtains any information it considers necessary to resolve 
issues related to the assurances, and may use site visits, public 
hearings, or any other procedures that HCFA considers appropriate in 
seeking this information.
    (c) Determination and notice by HCFA--(1) Determination. (i) On the 
basis of the investigation, HCFA determines whether the HMO has failed 
to comply with any of the assurances it gave under subpart D of this 
part.
    (ii) HCFA publishes in the Federal Register a notice of each 
determination of non-compliance.
    (2) Notice of determination: Corrective action. (i) HCFA gives the 
HMO written notice of the determination.
    (ii) The notice specifies the manner in which the HMO has not 
complied with its assurances and directs the HMO to initiate the 
corrective action that HCFA considers necessary to bring the HMO into 
compliance.
    (iii) The HMO must initiate this corrective action within 30 days of 
the date of the notice from HCFA, or within any longer period that HCFA 
determines to be reasonable and specifies in

[[Page 537]]

the notice. The HMO must carry out the corrective action within the time 
period specified by HCFA in the notice.
    (iv) The notice may provide the HMO an opportunity to submit, for 
HCFA's approval, proposed methods for achieving compliance.
    (d) Remedy: Revocation of qualification. If HCFA determines that a 
qualified HMO has failed to initiate or to carry out corrective action 
in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section--(1) HCFA revokes 
the HMO's qualification and notifies the HMO of this action.
    (2) In the notice, HCFA provides the HMO with an opportunity for 
reconsideration of the revocation, including, at the HMO's election, a 
fair hearing.
    (3) The revocation of qualification is effective on the tenth 
calendar day after the day of the notice unless HCFA receives a request 
for reconsideration by that date.
    (4) If after reconsideration HCFA again determines to revoke the 
HMO's qualification, this revocation is effective on the tenth calendar 
day after the date of the notice of reconsidered determination.
    (5) HCFA publishes in the Federal Register each determination it 
makes under this paragraph (d).
    (6) A revocation under this paragraph (d) has the effect described 
in Sec. 417.164.
    (e) Notice by the HMO. Within 15 days after the date HCFA issues a 
notice of revocation, the HMO must prepare a notice that explains, in 
readily understandable language, the reasons for the determination that 
it is not a qualified HMO, and send the notice to the following:
    (1) The HMO's enrollees.
    (2) Each employer or public entity that has offered enrollment in 
the HMO in accordance with subpart E of this part.
    (3) Each lawfully recognized collective bargaining representative or 
other representative of the employees of the employer or public entity.
    (f) Reimbursement of enrollees for services improperly denied, or 
for charges improperly imposed. (1) If HCFA determines, under paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, that an HMO is out of compliance, HCFA may 
require the HMO to reimburse its enrollees for the following--
    (i) Expenses for basic or supplemental health services that the 
enrollee obtained from other sources because the HMO failed to provide 
or arrange for them in accordance with its assurances.
    (ii) Any amounts the HMO charged the enrollee that are inconsistent 
with its assurances. (Rules applicable to charges for all enrollees are 
set forth in Secs. 417.104 and 417.105. The additional rules applicable 
to Medicare enrollees are in Sec. 415.454.)
    (2) This paragraph applies regardless of when the HMO failed to 
comply with the appropriate assurances.
    (g) Remedy: Civil suit--(1) Applicability. This paragraph applies to 
any HMO or other entity to which a grant, loan, or loan guarantee was 
awarded, as set forth in subpart V of this part, on the basis of its 
assurances regarding the furnishing of basic and supplemental services 
or its operation and organization, as the case may be.
    (2) Basis for action. If HCFA determines that the HMO or other 
entity has failed to initiate or refuses to carry out corrective action 
in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, HCFA may bring 
civil action in the U.S. district court for the district in which the 
HMO or other entity is located, to enforce compliance with the 
assurances it gave in applying for the grant, loan, or loan guarantee.

Sec. 417.166  Waiver of assurances.

    (a) General rule. HCFA may release an HMO from compliance with any 
assurances the HMO gives under subpart D of this part if--
    (1) The qualification requirements are changed by Federal law; or
    (2) The HMO shows good cause, consistent with the purposes of title 
XIII of the PHS Act.
    (b) Basis for finding of good cause. (1) Grounds upon which HCFA may 
find good cause include but are not limited to the following:
    (i) The HMO has filed for reorganization under Federal bankruptcy 
provisions and the reorganization can only be approved with the waiver 
of the assurances.
    (ii) State laws governing the entity have been changed after it 
signed the assurances so as to prohibit the HMO from being organized and 
operated in a manner consistent with the signed assurances.
    (2) Changes in State laws do not constitute good cause to the extent 
that the changes are preempted by Federal law under section 1311 of the 
PHS Act.
    (c) Consequences of waiver. If HCFA waives any assurances regarding 
compliance with section 1301 of the PHS Act, HCFA concurrently revokes 
the HMO's qualification unless the waiver is based on paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section.

    As used in this subpart and subparts K through R of this part, 
unless the context indicates otherwise--
    Adjusted average per capita cost (AAPCC) means an actuarial estimate 
made by HCFA in advance of an HMO's or CMP's contract period that 
represents what the average per capita cost to the Medicare program 
would be for each class of the HMO's or CMP's Medicare enrollees if they 
had received covered services other than through the HMO or CMP in the 
same geographic area or in a similar area.
    Adjusted community rate (ACR) is the equivalent of the premium that 
a risk HMO or CMP would charge Medicare enrollees independently of 
Medicare payments if the HMO or CMP used the same rates it charges non-
Medicare enrollees for a benefit package limited to covered Medicare 
services.
    Arrangement means a written agreement between an HMO or CMP and 
another entity, under which--

[[Page 539]]

    (1) The other entity agrees to furnish specified services to the 
HMO's or CMP's Medicare enrollees;
    (2) The HMO or CMP retains responsibility for the services; and
    (3) Medicare payment to the HMO or CMP discharges the beneficiary's 
obligation to pay for the services.
    Benefit stabilization fund means a fund established by HCFA, at the 
request of a risk HMO or CMP, to withhold a portion of the per capita 
payments available to the HMO or CMP and pay that portion in a 
subsequent contract period for the purpose of stabilizing fluctuations 
in the availability of the additional benefits the HMO or CMP provides 
to its Medicare enrollees.
    Cost contract means a Medicare contract under which HCFA pays the 
HMO or CMP on a reasonable cost basis.
    Cost HMO or CMP means an HMO or CMP that has in effect a cost 
contract with HCFA under section 1876 of the Act and subpart L of this 
part.
    Demonstration project means a demonstration project under section 
402 of the Social Security Amendments of 1967 (42 U.S.C. 1395b-1) or

    Emergency services means covered inpatient or outpatient services 
that are furnished by an appropriate source other than the HMO or CMP 
and that meet the following conditions:
    (1) Are needed immediately because of an injury or sudden illness.
    (2) Are such that the time required to reach the HMO's or CMP's 
providers or suppliers (or alternatives authorized by the HMO or CMP) 
would mean risk of permanent damage to the enrollee's health.

Once initiated, the services continue to be considered emergency 
services as long as transfer of the enrollee to the HMO's or CMP's 
source of health care or authorized alternative is precluded because of 
risk to the enrollee's health or because transfer would be unreasonable, 
given the distance and the nature of the medical condition.
    Geographic area means the area found by HCFA to be the area within 
which the HMO or CMP furnishes, or arranges for furnishing, the full 
range of services that it offers to its Medicare enrollees.

contract with HCFA under section 1876 of the Act and subpart L of this 
part.

    (1) Enrolls with an HMO or CMP after the date on which the HMO or 
CMP first enters into a risk contract under subpart L of this part; and
    (2) Was not enrolled with the HMO or CMP at the time he or she 
became entitled to benefits under Part A or eligible to enroll in Part B 
of Medicare.
    Risk contract means a Medicare contract under which HCFA pays the 
HMO or CMP on a risk basis for Medicare covered services.
    Risk HMO or CMP means an HMO or CMP that has in effect a risk 
contract with HCFA under section 1876 of the Act and subpart L of this 
part.
    Urgently needed services means covered services that are needed by 
an enrollee who is temporarily absent from the HMO's or CMP's geographic 
area and that--
    (1) Are required in order to prevent serious deterioration of the 
enrollee's health as a result of unforeseen injury or illness; and
    (2) Cannot be delayed until the enrollee returns to the HMO's or 
CMP's geographic area.

<R05>
Sec. 417.413  Qualifying condition: Operating experience and enrollment.

    (a) Condition. The HMO or CMP must demonstrate that it has operating 
experience and an enrolled population sufficient to provide a reasonable 
basis for establishing a prospective per capita reimbursement rate or a 
reasonable cost reimbursement rate, as appropriate.
    (b) Standard: Enrollment and operating experience for HMOs or CMPs 
to contract on a risk basis. To be eligible to contract on a risk 
basis--
    (1) A nonrural HMO or CMP must currently have the following:
    (i) At least 5,000 enrollees; and

    (ii) At least 75 Medicare enrollees or a plan acceptable to HCFA for 
achieving a Medicare enrollment of 75 within 2 years from the beginning 
of its initial contract period.
    (3) For purposes of this paragraph, an HMO or CMP is considered 
rural if at least 50 percent of its enrollees reside in nonmetropolitan 
areas. A nonmetropolitan area is an area--
    (i) No part of which is within a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) 
as designated by the Executive Office of Management and Budget; and
    (ii) That does not contain a city whose population exceeds 50,000 
individuals.
    (4) A subdivision or subsidiary of an HMO or CMP that meets the 
requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section need not 
demonstrate that it meets those requirements as an independent unit if 
the HMO or CMP assumes responsibility for the financial risk, and 
adequate management and supervision of health care services furnished by 
its subdivision or subsidiary.
    (c) Standard: Enrollment and operating experience for HMOs or CMPs 
to contract on a cost basis. To be eligible to contract on a reasonable 
cost basis, an HMO or CMP must currently have enrollees sufficient in 
number to provide a reasonable basis for entering into a contract, as 
follows:
    (1) At least 1,500 enrollees.
    (2) At least 75 Medicare enrollees, or a plan acceptable to HCFA for 
achieving--
    (i) A Medicare enrollment of 75 within 2 years from the beginning of 
its initial contract period; and
    (ii) At least 250 Medicare enrollees by the beginning of its fourth 
contract period.
    (d) Standard: Composition of enrollment. (1) Requirement. Except as 
specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and (e) of this section, not more than 50 
percent of an HMO's or CMP's enrollment may be Medicare beneficiaries 
and Medicaid recipients.
    (2) Waiver of composition of enrollment standard. HCFA may waive 
compliance with the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section if 
the HMO or CMP has made and is making reasonable efforts to enroll 
individuals who are not Medicare beneficiaries or Medicaid recipients, 
and it meets either of the following requirements:
    (i) The HMO or CMP serves a geographic area in which Medicare 
beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients constitute more than 50 percent of 
the population. (HCFA does not grant a waiver that would permit the 
percentage of Medicare and Medicaid enrollees to exceed the percentage 
of Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients in the population of 
the geographic area.)
    (ii) The HMO or CMP is owned and operated by a government entity. 
The waiver may be for a period up to three years after the date the HMO 
or CMP first enters into a contract under this subpart, and may not be 
extended.
    (3) Waiver granted on or before October 21, 1986. An HMO or CMP (or 
a successor HMO or CMP) that as of October 21, 1986, had been granted an 
exception, waiver, or modification of the requirements of paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section, but that does not meet the requirements of 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section, must make (and throughout the period 
of the exception, waiver, or modification continue to make) reasonable 
efforts to meet scheduled enrollment goals, consistent with a

[[Page 543]]

schedule of compliance approved by HCFA.
    (i) If HCFA determines that the HMO or CMP has complied, or made 
significant progress toward compliance, with the approved schedule, and 
that an extension is in the best interest of the Medicare program, HCFA 
may extend the waiver of modification.
    (ii) If HCFA determines that the HMO or CMP has not complied with 
the approved schedule, HCFA may apply the sanctions described in 
paragraphs (d)(6) and (d)(7) of this section.
    (4) Basis for application of sanctions. HCFA may, as an alternative 
to contract termination, apply the sanctions specified in paragraph 
(d)(6) of this section if HCFA determines that the HMO or CMP is not 
complying with the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), or (d)(3) 
of this section, as applicable.
    (5) Notice of sanction. Before applying the sanctions specified in 
paragraph (d)(6) of this section, HCFA sends a written notice to the HMO 
or CMP stating the proposed action and its basis. HCFA gives the HMO or 
CMP 15 days after the date of the notice to provide evidence 
establishing the HMO's or CMP's compliance with the requirements in 
paragraph (d)(1), (d)(2), or (d)(3) of this section, as applicable.
    (6) Sanctions. If, following review of the HMO's or CMP's timely 
response to HCFA's notice, HCFA determines that an HMO or CMP does not 
comply with the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), or (d)(3) of 
this section, HCFA may apply either of the following sanctions:
    (i) Require the HMO or CMP to stop accepting new enrollment 
applications after a date specified by HCFA.
    (ii) Deny payment for individuals who are formally added or 
``accreted'' to HCFA's records as Medicare enrollees after a date 
specified by HCFA.
    (7) Termination by HCFA. In addition to the sanctions described in 
paragraph (d)(6) of this section. HCFA may decline to renew an HMO's or 
CMP's contract in accordance with Sec. 417.492(b), or terminate its 
contract in accordance with Sec. 417.494(b) if HCFA determines that the 
HMO or CMP no longer substantially meets the requirements of paragraphs 
(d)(1), (d)(2), or (d)(3) of this section.
    (e) Standard: Open enrollment. (1) Except as specified in paragraph 
(e)(2) of this section, an HMO or CMP must enroll Medicare beneficiaries 
on a first-come, first-served basis to the limit of its capacity and 
provide annual open enrollment periods of at least 30 days duration for 
Medicare beneficiaries.
    (2) HCFA may waive the requirement of paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section if compliance would prevent compliance with the limitation on 
enrollment of Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients (paragraph 
(d) of this section) or result in an enrollment substantially 
nonrepresentative of the population of the HMO's or CMP's geographic 
area. The enrollment would be ``substantially nonrepresentative'' if the 
proportion of a subgroup to the total enrollment exceeded, by 10 percent 
or more, its proportion of the population in the HMO's or CMP's 
geographic area, as shown by census data or other data acceptable to 
HCFA. For purposes of this paragraph, a subgroup means a class of 
Medicare enrollees as defined in Sec. 417.582.

    (a) Condition. The HMO or CMP must demonstrate that it is capable of 
delivering to Medicare enrollees the range of services required in 
accordance with this section.
    (b) Standard: Range of services furnished by eligible HMOs or CMPs. 
(1) Basic requirement. Except as specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section, an HMO or CMP must furnish to its Medicare enrollees (directly 
or through arrangements with others) all the Medicare services to which 
those enrollees are entitled to the extent that they are available to 
Medicare beneficiaries who reside in the HMO's or CMP's geographic area 
but are not enrolled in the HMO or CMP.
    (2) Criteria for availability. The services are considered available 
if--
    (i) The sources are located within the HMO's or CMP's geographic 
area; or
    (ii) It is common practice to refer patients to sources outside that 
geographic area.

[[Page 544]]

    (3) Exception for hospice care. An HMO or CMP is not required to 
furnish hospice care as described in part 418 of this chapter. However, 
HMOs or CMPs must inform their Medicare enrollees about the availability 
of hospice care if--
    (i) A hospice participating in Medicare is located within the HMO's 
or CMP's geographic area; or
    (ii) It is common practice to refer patients to hospices outside the 
geographic area.
    (c) Standard: Financial responsibility for services furnished 
outside the HMO or CMP. (1) An HMO or CMP must assume financial 
responsibility and provide reasonable reimbursement for emergency 
services and urgently needed services (as defined in Sec. 417.401) that 
are obtained by its Medicare enrollees from providers and suppliers 
outside the HMO or CMP even in the absence of the HMO's or CMP's prior 
approval.
    (2) An HMO or CMP must assume financial responsibility for services 
that the Medicare enrollee attempted to obtain from the HMO or CMP, but 
that the HMO or CMP failed to furnish or unreasonably denied, and that 
are found, upon appeal by the enrollee under subpart Q of this part, to

Sec. 417.424  Denial of enrollment.

    (a) Basis for denial. An HMO or CMP may deny enrollment to an

enrollment;

    (b) Selection policies. (1) Denial under paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section must be in accordance with written selection policies approved 
by HCFA. (2) Enrollment of individuals will not be considered to make

result of the enrollment, the proportion of the subgroup of enrollees to 
which the enrollee belongs as compared to the HMO's or CMP's total 
enrollment exceeds by at least ten percent the subgroup's proportion of 
the general population in the geographic area of the HMO or CMP. (A

received and until its enrollment capacity is reached.
    (3) The HMO or CMP may accept applications from Medicare 
beneficiaries after it has reached capacity if it places those 
individuals on a waiting list and enrolls them in chronological order as 
vacancies occur.
    (b) Capacity to accept new enrollees. (1) If an HMO or CMP chooses

time

[[Page 547]]

Sec. 417.428  Marketing activities.

    (a) Required marketing activities. An HMO or CMP must meet the 
following requirements:
    (1) Offer its plan to Medicare beneficiaries and provide to those

other information necessary for beneficiaries to make an informed 
decision about enrollment.
    (2) Notify the general public of its enrollment period (whether time 
limited or continuous) in an appropriate manner through appropriate 
media, throughout its enrollment area.
    (3) Submit all marketing materials to HCFA at least 45 days before 
their planned distribution.
    (4) Include in the HMO's or CMP's written materials provided to 
prospective enrollees prior to enrollment, notice that the HMO or CMP is 
authorized by law to terminate or refuse to renew its contract with 
HCFA, that HCFA may also choose to terminate or refuse to renew its 
contact with the HMO or CMP and that termination or nonrenewal may 
result in termination of the individual's enrollment in the HMO or CMP.
    (b) Prohibited marketing activities--general. In offering its plan 
to Medicare beneficiaries, an HMO or CMP may not engage in any of the 
following practices or activities:
    (1) Practices that are discriminatory. For example, the HMO or CMP 
may not engage in any activity intended to recruit Medicare 
beneficiaries from higher income areas (usually an indicator of better 
health) without making a comparable effort to enroll Medicare 
beneficiaries from lower income areas.
    (2) Activities that could mislead or confuse Medicare beneficiaries, 
or misrepresent the HMO or CMP its marketing representatives, or HCFA. 
For example, the HMO or CMP may not claim that it is recommended or 
endorsed by HCFA or that HCFA recommends that the beneficiary enroll in 
the HMO or CMP. It may, however, explain that the entity is approved as 
an HMO or CMP for purposes of participation in Medicare.
    (3) Offers of gifts or payment as an inducement to enroll in the HMO 
or CMP. This does not prohibit the explanation of any legitimate 
benefits the beneficiary might obtain as an enrollee of the HMO or CMP 
such as eligibility to enroll in a supplemental benefit plan that covers 
deductibles and coinsurance or preventive services.
    (4) Door-to-door solicitation of Medicare beneficiaries.
    (5) Distribution of marketing materials if, before the expiration of 
the 45-day period described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the HMO 
or CMP receives written notice from HCFA that HCFA has disapproved the 
material because it is inaccurate or misleading or it misrepresents the 
HMO or CMP, its marketing representatives or HCFA.
    (c) Marketing activities of risk HMOs or CMPs In addition to the 
generally permitted or prohibited marketing activities described in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a risk HMO or CMP must provide 
potential Medicare enrollees with adequate written descriptions of the 
additional benefits or services, or reductions in premiums, deductible 
or copayments that may pertain under payment on a risk basis.

make the enrollment effective; or
    (ii) If the HMO or CMP is currently enrolled to capacity, explains 
the procedures that will be followed when vacancies occur.
    (5) The notice of denial explains the reason for denial.
    (6) The HMO or CMP transmits the information necessary for HCFA to 
add the beneficiary to its records of the HMO's or CMP's Medicare 
enrollees--
    (i) Within 30 days from the date of application or from the date a 
vacancy occurs for an applicant who was accepted (for future enrollment) 
while there were no vacancies; or
    (ii) Within an additional period of time approved by HCFA on a 
showing by the HMO or CMP that it needs more time.
    (7) The HMO or CMP promptly notifies the beneficiary of the 
effective month of his or her enrollment as a Medicare enrollee, when it 
receives that information from HCFA.
    (8) If the HMO or CMP accepts applications while it is enrolled to 
capacity, its procedures ensure that vacancies are filled in 
chronological order by date of application of beneficiaries who are 
still eligible to enroll, unless that would result in failure to comply 
with any of the qualifying conditions set forth in Sec. 417.413.

disenroll from the HMO or CMP the individual's conversion to a Medicare

    (c) Prohibition against disenrollment. An HMO or CMP may not 
disenroll an individual who is converting under the provisions of 
paragraph (a) of this section unless one of the conditions specified in 
Sec. 417.460 is met.
    (d) Application form. The individual who is converting must sign an 
application form as described in Sec. 417.430(a).
    (e) Expedited submittal of information to HCFA. The HMO or CMP must

    (4) The obligation of the HMO or CMP to assume financial 
responsibility and provide reasonable reimbursement for emergency 
services and urgently needed services as required by Sec. 417.414(c).
    (5) Any services other than the emergency or urgently needed 
services that the HMO or CMP chooses to provide as permitted by this 
part, from sources outside the HMO or CMP. A cost HMO or CMP must 
disclose that the enrollee may receive services through any Medicare 
providers and suppliers.
    (6) Premium information, including the amount (or if the amount 
cannot be included, the telephone number of the source from which this 
information may be obtained) and the procedures for paying premiums and 
other charges for which enrollees may be liable.
    (7) Grievance and appeal procedures.
    (8) Disenrollment rights.
    (9) The obligation of an enrollee who is leaving the HMO's or CMP's 
geographic area for more than 90 days to notify the HMO or CMP of the 
move or extended absence and the HMO's or CMP's policies concerning 
retention of enrollees who leave the geographic area for more than 90 
days, as described in Sec. 417.460(a)(2).
    (10) The expiration date of the Medicare contract with HCFA and 
notice that both HCFA and the HMO or CMP are authorized by law to 
terminate or refuse to renew the contract, and that termination or 
nonrenewal of the contract may result in termination of the individual's 
enrollment in the HMO or CMP.
    (11) Advance directives as specified in paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (12) Any other matters that HCFA may prescribe.
    (b) Availability of rules. The HMO or CMP must furnish a copy of the 
rules to each Medicare enrollee at the time of enrollment and at least 
annually thereafter.
    (c) Changes in rules. If an HMO or CMP changes its rules, it must 
submit the changes to HCFA in accordance with Sec. 417.428(a)(3), and 
notify its Medicare enrollees of the changes at least 30 days before the 
effective date of the changes.
    (d) Advance directives. (1) An HMO or CMP must maintain written 
policies and procedures concerning advance directives, as defined in 
Sec. 489.100 of this chapter, with respect to all adult individuals 
receiving medical care by or through the HMO or CMP and are required to:
    (i) Provide written information to those individuals concerning--
    (A) Their rights under the law of the State in which the 
organization furnishes services (whether statutory or recognized by the 
courts of the State) to make decisions concerning such medical care, 
including the right to accept or refuse medical or surgical treatment 
and the right to formulate, at the individual's option, advance 
directives. Providers are permitted to contract with other entities to 
furnish this information but are still legally responsible for ensuring 
that the requirements of this section are met. Such information must 
reflect changes in State law as soon as possible, but no later than 90 
days after the effective date of the State law; and
    (B) The HMO's or CMP's written policies respecting the 
implementation of those rights, including a clear and precise statement 
of limitation if the HMO or CMP cannot implement an advance directive as 
a matter of conscience. At a minimum, this statement should:
    (1) Clarify any differences between institution-wide conscience 
objections and those that may be raised by individual physicians;
    (2) Identify the state legal authority permitting such objection; 
and
    (3) Describe the range of medical conditions or procedures affected 
by the conscience objection.
    (ii) Provide the information specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) of 
this section to each enrollee at the time of initial enrollment. If an 
enrollee is incapacitated at the time of initial enrollment and is 
unable to receive information (due to the incapacitating condition or

[[Page 550]]

a mental disorder) or articulate whether or not he or she has executed 
an advance directive, the HMO or CMP may give advance directive 
information to the enrollee's family or surrogate in the same manner 
that it issues other materials about policies and procedures to the 
family of the incapacitated enrollee or to a surrogate or other 
concerned persons in accordance with State law. The HMO or CMP is not 
relieved of its obligation to provide this information to the enrollee 
once he or she is no longer incapacitated or unable to receive such 
information. Follow-up procedures must be in place to ensure that the 
information is given to the individual directly at the appropriate time.
    (iii) Document in the individual's medical record whether or not the 
individual has executed an advance directive;
    (iv) Not condition the provision of care or otherwise discriminate 
against an individual based on whether or not the individual has 
executed an advance directive;
    (v) Ensure compliance with requirements of State law (whether 
statutory or recognized by the courts of the State) regarding advance 
directives;
    (vi) Provide for education of staff concerning its policies and 
procedures on advance directives; and
    (vii) Provide for community education regarding advance directives 
that may include material required in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A) of this 
section, either directly or in concert with other providers or entities. 
Separate community education materials may be developed and used, at the 
discretion of the HMO or CMP. The same written materials are not 
required for all settings, but the material should define what 
constitutes an advance directive, emphasizing that an advance directive 
is designed to enhance an incapacitated individual's control over 
medical treatment, and describe applicable State law concerning advance 
directives. An HMO or CMP must be able to document its community 
education efforts.
    (2) The HMO or CMP--(i) Is not required to provide care that 
conflicts with an advance directive.
    (ii) Is not required to implement an advance directive if, as a 
matter of conscience, the HMO or CMP cannot implement an advance 
directive and State law allows any health care provider or any agent of 
such provider to conscientiously object.
    (3) The HMO or CMP must inform individuals that complaints 
concerning non-compliance with the advance directive requirements may be 
filed with the State survey and certification agency.

[[Page 551]]

and Part B services, and, for risk HMOs or CMPs, in addition to the 
additional benefits required under Sec. 417.442. The HMO or CMP may not 
set health status standards for those enrollees whom it will accept for 
these optional supplemental services.
    (3) Supplemental services imposed by a risk HMO or CMP. (i) Subject 
to HCFA's approval, a risk HMO or CMP may require Medicare enrollees to 
accept and pay for services in addition to those covered by Medicare. 
(ii) If the HMO or CMP elects this option, it must impose the 
requirement on all Medicare enrollees, without regard to health status. 
(iii) HCFA approves supplemental benefits of this type if HCFA 
determines that imposition of the requirements will not discourage other 
Medicare beneficiaries from enrolling in the risk HMO or CMP.
    (4) Additional benefits from risk HMOs or CMPs required by statute. 
Subject to the conditions stated in Sec. 417.442, a new Medicare 
enrollee or a current nonrisk Medicare enrollee who converts to risk 
reimbursement under Sec. 417.444 is eligible to receive, in addition to 
the covered Part A and Part B benefits for which he or she is eligible, 
benefits consisting of one or both of the following:
    (i) A reduction in the HMO's or CMP's premium rate or in other 
charges for services furnished to Medicare enrollees.
    (ii) Provision of health benefits or services beyond the required 
Part A and Part B coverage.
    (5) Special supplemental benefits. Under conditions described in 
Sec. 417.444(c), current nonrisk Medicare enrollees who are not 
converted to the risk portion of the contract, may enroll in a special 
supplemental plan, if offered by the HMO or CMP, for some or all of the 
additional benefits described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (c) Limitation on hospice care. (1) Extent of limitation. (i) Basic 
rule. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, a 
Medicare enrollee who elects to receive hospice care under Sec. 418.24 
of this chapter waives the right to receive from the HMO or CMP any 
Medicare services (including services equivalent to hospice care) that 
are related to the terminal condition for which the enrollee elected 
hospice care, or to a related condition.
    (ii) Exception. An enrollee who elects hospice care retains the 
right to services furnished by his or her attending physician if that 
physician--
    (A) Is an employee or contractor of the HMO or CMP; and
    (B) Is not an employee of the designated hospice and does not 
receive compensation from the hospice for those services.
    (2) Effective date of limitation. The limitation in paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section begins on the effective date of the beneficiary's 
election of hospice care and remains in effect until the earlier of the 
following:
    (i) The effective date of the enrollee's revocation of the election 
of hospice care as described in Sec. 418.28 of this chapter.
    (ii) The date the enrollee exhausts his or her hospice benefits.
    (3) Payment to HMO or CMP. For the period that the Medicare 
enrollee's election of hospice care is in effect, HCFA pays a cost HMO 
or CMP only as described in Sec. 417.585.
    (d) Limitation on provision of inpatient hospital services. If a 
beneficiary's effective date of coverage, as specified in Sec. 417.450, 
in a risk HMO or CMP occurs during an inpatient stay in a hospital paid 
for under part 412 of this chapter, the HMO or CMP--
    (1) Is not responsible for the provision of any of the inpatient 
hospital services under Part A during the stay and is not required to 
pay for those services;
    (2) Must assume responsibility for payment for or provision of 
inpatient hospital services under Part A on the day after the day of 
discharge from the inpatient stay; and
    (3) Is responsible for the full scope of services under paragraph 
(b) of this section, other than inpatient hospital services under Part 
A, beginning on the effective date of enrollment.
    (e) Extension of provision of inpatient hospital services. If an 
enrollee's effective date of disenrollment, as defined by Sec. 417.460, 
occurs during an inpatient stay in a hospital paid for under part 412 of 
this chapter and the stay is provided or arranged for by the HMO or CMP, 
or the HMO or CMP is financially

[[Page 552]]

responsible for the hospitalization under paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, the HMO or CMP--
    (1) Is financially responsible for payment of the inpatient services 
under Part A through the date the beneficiary is discharged from the 
inpatient stay; and
    (2) Is not responsible for the provision of services, furnished on 
or after the effective date of disenrollment, other than inpatient 
hospital services under Part A.
    (f) Notice of noncoverage of inpatient hospital care. (1) If an 
enrollee is an inpatient of a hospital, entitlement to inpatient 
hospital care continues until he or she receives notice of noncoverage 
of that care.
    (2) Before giving notice of noncoverage, the HMO or CMP must obtain 
the concurrence of its affiliated physician responsible for the hospital 
care of the enrollee, or other physician as authorized by the HMO or 
CMP.
    (3) The HMO or CMP must give the enrollee written notice that 
includes the following:
    (i) The reason why inpatient hospital care is no longer needed.
    (ii) The effective date of the enrollee's liability for continued 
inpatient care.
    (iii) The enrollee's appeal rights.
    (4) If the HMO or CMP delegates to the hospital the determination of 
noncoverage of inpatient care, the hospital obtains the concurrence of 
the HMO- or CMP-affiliated physician responsible for the hospital care 
of the enrollee, or other physician as authorized by the HMO or CMP, and 
sends notice, following the procedures set forth in Sec. 412.42(c)(3) of 
this chapter.

Sec. 417.442  Risk HMO's and CMP's: Conditions for provision of additional benefits.

    (a) General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section, a risk HMO or CMP must, during any contract period, provide to 
its Medicare enrollees the additional benefits described in 
Sec. 417.440(b)(4) if its ACRs (calculated in accordance with 
Sec. 417.594) are less than the average per capita rates that HCFA pays 
for the Medicare enrollees during the contract period.
    (b) Exceptions. (1) Reduced payment election. An HMO or CMP is not 
obligated to furnish additional services under paragraph (a) of this 
section if it has requested a reduction in its monthly payment from HCFA 
under Sec. 417.592(e), and it--
    (i) Elects to receive reduced payment so that there is no difference 
between the average of its per capita rates of payment and its ACR; or
    (ii) Elects to receive partially reduced payment and furnish 
Medicare enrollees with additional benefits described in Sec. 417.440 
(b)(4) so that the combined value of benefits and reduced payment is 
equivalent to the difference between the average of its per capita rates 
of payment and its ACR.
    (2) Benefit stabilization fund. An HMO or CMP may elect to have a 
part of the value of the additional benefits it must provide under 
paragraph (a) of this section withheld in a benefit stabilization fund 
as described in Sec. 417.596.

<R05>
Sec. 417.444  Special rules for certain enrollees of risk HMOs and CMPs.

    (a) Applicability. This section applies to any Medicare enrollee of 
a risk HMO or CMP who meets the following conditions:
    (1) On February 1, 1985, was enrolled--
    (i) In an HMO or CMP that had in effect a cost contract entered into 
under section 1876 of the Act in accordance with regulations in effect 
before February 1, 1985; or
    (ii) In an HCPP that was being reimbursed on a reasonable cost basis 
under section 1833(a)(1)(A) of the Act.
    (2) Has continued enrollment in the same entity without interruption 
or disenrolled after February 1, 1985, and later reenrolled in the same 
entity.
    (b) Retention of nonrisk status--(1) A ``nonrisk'' enrollee is a 
Medicare beneficiary who meets the conditions of paragraph (a) of this 
section and is enrolled in an entity that enters into a risk contract as 
an HMO or CMP. A ``nonrisk'' enrollee may retain nonrisk

[[Page 553]]

status indefinitely unless HCFA determines under paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section, that the enrollee's status must be changed, or the 
enrollee requests the change, as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section.
    (2) A nonrisk enrollee of a risk HMO or CMP is not entitled to 
additional benefits under Sec. 417.442.
    (c) Conversion to risk status--(1) Conversion based on HCFA 
determination. If HCFA determines that, for administrative reasons or 
because there are fewer than 75 current nonrisk Medicare enrollees 
remaining in the HMO or CMP, all of its nonrisk Medicare enrollees must 
be covered under the risk provisions of the contract, the conversion 
process is as follows:
    (i) HCFA notifies each affected enrollee of the decision at least 90 
days prior to the effective date.
    (ii) The nonrisk Medicare enrollees complete and sign forms stating 
that they understand and accept the new rules and benefits that will be 
applicable to them.
    (iii) The HMO or CMP notifies each affected enrollee, in writing, at 
least 30 days in advance, of the date upon which his or her coverage 
under the risk portion of the contract takes effect.
    (2) Conversion based on enrollee's request. A nonrisk Medicare 
enrollee requests, using a form identical or similar to the form 
described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, that he or she be covered 
under the risk portion of the contract.
    (d) Notification. An HMO or CMP converting from a cost contract to a 
risk contract must, within 60 days of signing the risk contract, inform 
nonrisk enrollees of their right to remain nonrisk Medicare enrollees or 
to convert to risk enrollment at any time in accordance with paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section.

Sec. 417.448  Restriction on payments for services received by Medicare enrollees of risk HMOs or CMPs.

    (a) Basic rule. Except for emergency and urgently needed services as

payments to or on behalf of certain Medicare enrollees, for any services 
received by the enrollees that are not provided--
    (1) Directly by the HMO or CMP; or
    (2) Through arrangements made by the HMO or CMP.

and
    (3) Nonrisk Medicare enrollees who elect special supplemental 
benefit plans.
    (c) End of restriction. The restriction of payments imposed by 
paragraph (a) of this section ends when a Medicare enrollee leaves the 
HMO's or CMP's geographic area for an extended period as defined in 
Sec. 471.460(a)(2) and the HMO or CMP and the enrollee make arrangements 
for enrollment to continue as provided in Sec. 417.460(a)(2)(iv).
    (d) Timing. The effective date for the end of the restriction on 
payments, as discussed in paragraph (c) of this section is the first day 
of the first month following the month in which the enrollee notifies 
the HMO or CMP as required in Sec. 417.436(a)(9), that he or she has 
left the HMO's or CMP's geographic area for an extended period.

[51 FR 28573, Aug. 8, 1986, as amended at 56 FR 46571, Sept. 13, 1991;

Medicare beneficiary begins on the first day of the month in which he or 
she is--
    (i) Entitled to Medicare benefits; and
    (ii) Enrolled in an HMO or CMP; and
    (2) The effective month of coverage may not be earlier than the 
first month after, nor later than the third month after the month in 
which HCFA receives the information necessary to include the beneficiary 
as a Medicare enrollee of the HMO or CMP in HCFA records.

[[Page 554]]

    (b) Exceptions. (1) HCFA may approve a later month if it is 
requested by the HMO or CMP and the beneficiary.
    (2) If an individual becomes an HMO or CMP enrollee before becoming 
entitled to Medicare Part B benefits, the effective month of coverage is 
the first month for which he or she becomes entitled to Medicare Part B 
benefits.
    (c) Notice of effective date of coverage. For each beneficiary added 
to HCFA's records as an enrollee of an HMO or CMP, HCFA gives the HMO or 
CMP prompt written notice of the month with which HCFA's liability 
begins.

<R05>
Sec. 417.452  Liability of Medicare enrollees.

    (a) Deductibles and coinsurance. (1) A Medicare enrollee of an HMO 
or CMP is responsible for applicable Medicare deductible and coinsurance 
amounts, unless the HMO's or CMP's charges for these amounts are reduced 
under the additional benefits provision of Sec. 417.442.
    (2) The deductible and coinsurance amounts may be paid by or on 
behalf of the enrollee in the form of a premium, membership fee, charge 
per unit, or other similar charge.
    (3) The sum of the amounts the HMO or CMP charges its Medicare 
enrollees for Medicare deductibles and coinsurance may not exceed, on 
the average, the actuarial value of the deductible and coinsurance the 
Medicare enrollees otherwise would have been liable for had they not 
enrolled in the HMO or CMP or in another HMO or CMP.
    (b) Services not covered under Medicare. Unless the services are 
provided as additional benefits under Sec. 417.442, a Medicare enrollee 
of an HMO or CMP is liable for payment for--
    (1) All services that are not covered under Medicare Part A or Part 
B; or
    (2) If entitled only to Medicare Part B benefits, all services that 
are not covered under Medicare Part B.
    (c) Services for which Medicare is not primary payer. A Medicare 
enrollee of an HMO or CMP is liable for payments made to the enrollee 
for all covered services for which Medicare is not the primary payer as 
provided in Sec. 417.528.
    (d) Optional supplemental benefits plan. (1) The HMO or CMP may 
offer its Medicare enrollees a supplemental benefit plan to cover 
deductible and coinsurance amounts, or services not covered under 
Medicare, or both.
    (2) If a supplemental benefit plan premium includes charges for both 
noncovered services and the deductible and coinsurance amounts 
applicable to covered services, the portion of the premium that is for 
deductibles and coinsurance must be computed separately and must be 
disclosed to the beneficiary during the enrollment process and before he 
or she elects coverage options.
    (3) The sum of the amounts an HMO or CMP charges its Medicare 
enrollees for services that are not covered under Part A or Part B may 
not exceed the ACR for these services.
    (e) Coverage of Part A services for Part B-only Medicare enrollees. 
If an HMO or CMP furnishes coverage of Medicare Part A services to a 
Medicare enrollee entitled to Part B only, the HMO's or CMP's premium 
(or other payment method) for these services may not exceed the ACR for 
these services. In addition, if a risk HMO or CMP furnishes these 
services and supplemental services, which are the same as the additional 
benefits furnished Medicare enrollees of the HMO or CMP who are entitled 
to benefits under both Parts A and B, the HMO's or CMP's combined 
premium for both these groups of services that the Part B enrollee must 
pay may not exceed 95 percent of the weighted average AAPCC for Part A 
services (or the Medicare payment for Part A services, if it is less) 
for the Medicare enrollee of the HMO or CMP.

[[Page 555]]

    (3) Services for which Medicare is not the primary payor as provided 
in Sec. 417.528.
    (b) Limit on charges for inpatient hospital care. If a Medicare 
enrollee who is an inpatient of a hospital requests immediate PRO review 
(as provided in Sec. 417.605) of any determination by the hospital 
furnishing services or the HMO or CMP that the inpatient hospital 
services will no longer be covered, the HMO or CMP may not charge the 
enrollee for any inpatient care costs incured before noon of the first 
working day after the PRO issues its review decision.
    (c) Reporting requirements. A risk HMO or CMP must report, within 90 
days after the end of the contract period, all premiums, enrollment 
fees, and other charges collected from its Medicare enrollees during

    Amounts incorrectly collected means amounts collected that are in 
excess of those specified in Sec. 417.452. It includes amounts collected 
when the enrollee was believed not entitled to Medicare benefits if the 
enrollee is later determined to have been entitled to Medicare benefits 
and HCFA is liable for payments as specified in Sec. 417.450.
    Other amounts due means amounts due a Medicare enrollee for services 
obtained outside the HMO or CMP if they were--
    (1) Emergency services;
    (2) Urgently needed services for which the HMO or CMP has assumed 
financial responsibility; or

premiums.
    (2) Other amounts due.
    (3) All amounts due, if the HMO or CMP is going out of business.
    (d) Refund by premium adjustment or lump sum payment or both. An HMO

payment, or by a combination of both methods, for amounts that were 
incorrectly collected in the form of premiums or through a combination 
of premium payments and other charges.
    (e) Refund when enrollee has died or cannot be located. If an 
enrollee has died or cannot be located after reasonable effort by the 
HMO or CMP, the HMO or CMP must make the refund in accordance with State 
law.

accordance with paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section by the end of 
the contract period following the contract period during which an amount 
was determined to be due an enrollee, HCFA reduces its payment to the 
HMO or CMP by the amounts incorrectly collected or otherwise due, and

amounts for which Medicare enrollees were liable in a previous contract 
period except in the following circumstances:
    (a) The HMO or CMP failed to collect the deductible and coinsurance 
amounts during the contract period in which they were due because of--
    (1) Underestimation of the actuarial value of the deductible and 
coinsurance amounts; or
    (2) A billing error.

[[Page 556]]

    (b) The HMO or CMP has identified the amounts and obtained advance

<R05>
Sec. 417.460  Disenrollment of beneficiaries by an HMO or CMP.

    (a) General rule. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (i) 
of this section, an HMO or CMP may not--
    (1) Disenroll a Medicare beneficiary; or
    (2) Orally or in writing, or by any action or inaction, request or 
encourage a Medicare enrollee to disenroll.
    (b) Bases for disenrollment: Overview. (1) Optional disenrollment. 
Generally, an HMO or CMP may disenroll a Medicare enrollee if he or 
she--
    (i) Fails to pay the required premiums or other charges;
    (ii) Commits fraud or permits abuse of his or her enrollment card; 
or
    (iii) Behaves in a manner that seriously impairs the HMO's or CMP's 
ability to furnish health care services to the particular enrollee or to 
other enrollees.
    (2) Required disenrollment. Generally, an HMO or CMP must disenroll 
a Medicare enrollee if he or she--
    (i) Moves out of the HMO's or CMP's geographic area;
    (ii) Fails to convert to the risk provisions of the HMO's or CMP's 
Medicare contract;
    (iii) Loses entitlement to Medicare Part B benefits; or
    (iv) Dies.
    (3) Related provisions. Specific requirements, limitations, and 
exceptions are set forth in paragraphs (c) through (i) of this section.
    (c) Failure to pay premiums or other charges. (1) Basic rule. Except 
as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, an HMO or CMP may 
disenroll a Medicare enrollee who fails to pay premiums or other charges 
imposed by the HMO or CMP for deductible and coinsurance amounts for 
which the enrollee is liable, if the HMO or CMP--
    (i) Can demonstrate to HCFA that it made reasonable efforts to 
collect the unpaid amount;
    (ii) Gives the enrollee written notice of disenrollment, including 
an explanation of the enrollee's right to a hearing under the HMO's or 
CMP's grievance procedures; and
    (iii) Sends the notice of disenrollment to the enrollee before it 
notifies HCFA.
    (2) Exception. If the enrollee fails to pay the premium for optional 
supplemental benefits (that is, a package of benefits that an enrollee 
is not required to accept), but pays the basic premium and other 
charges, the HMO or CMP may discontinue the optional benefits but may 
not disenroll the beneficiary.
    (d) Enrollee commits fraud or permits abuse of the enrollment card. 
(1) Basis for disenrollment. An HMO or CMP may disenroll a Medicare 
beneficiary if the beneficiary--
    (i) Knowingly provides, on the application form, fraudulent 
information that materially affects the beneficiary's eligibility to 
enroll in the HMO or CMP; or
    (ii) Intentionally permits others to use his or her enrollment card 
to obtain services from the HMO or CMP.
    (2) Notice requirement. If disenrollment is for either of the 
reasons specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the HMO or CMP 
must give the beneficiary a written notice of termination of enrollment.
    (i) The notice must be mailed to the enrollee before submission of 
the disenrollment notice to HCFA.
    (ii) The notice must include an explanation of the enrollee's right 
to have the disenrollment heard under the grievance procedures 
established in accordance with Sec. 417.436.
    (3) Report to the Inspector General. The HMO or CMP must report to 
the Office of the Inspector General of the Department any disenrollment 
based on fraud or abuse by the enrollee.
    (e) Disenrollment for cause. (1) Basis for disenrollment. An HMO or 
CMP may disenroll a Medicare enrollee for cause if the enrollee's 
behavior is disruptive, unruly, abusive, or uncooperative to

[[Page 557]]

the extent that his or her continuing enrollment in the HMO or CMP 
seriously impairs the HMO's or CMP's ability to furnish services to 
either the particular enrollee or other enrollees.
    (2) Effort to resolve the problem. The HMO or CMP must make a 
serious effort to resolve the problem presented by the enrollee, 
including the use (or attempted use) of internal grievance procedures.
    (3) Consideration of extenuating circumstances. The HMO or CMP must 
ascertain that the enrollee's behavior is not related to the use of 
medical services or to mental illness.
    (4) Documentation. The HMO or CMP must document the problems, 
efforts, and medical conditions as described in paragraphs (e)(1) 
through (e)(3) of this section.
    (5) HCFA review of an HMO's or CMP's proposed disenrollment for 
cause. (i) HCFA decides on the basis of review of the documentation 
submitted by the HMO or CMP, whether disenrollment requirements have 
been met.
    (ii) HCFA makes this decision within 20 working days after receipt 
of the documentation material, and notifies the HMO or CMP within 5 
working days after making its decision.
    (6) Effective date of disenrollment. If HCFA permits an HMO or CMP 
to disenroll an enrollee for cause, the disenrollment takes effect on 
the first day of the calendar month after the month in which the HMO or 
CMP gives the enrollee a written notice of disenrollment that meets the 
requirements set forth in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (d)(2)(ii) of this 
section.
    (f) Enrollee moves out of the HMO's or CMP's geographic area. (1) 
Basic rules. (i) Disenrollment. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) 
of this section, an HMO or CMP must disenroll a Medicare enrollee who 
moves out of its geographic area if the HMO or CMP establishes, on the 
basis of a written statement from the enrollee, or other evidence 
acceptable to HCFA, that the enrollee has permanently moved out of its 
geographic area.
    (ii) Notice requirement. The HMO or CMP must comply with the notice 
requirements set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (iii) Effect on geographic area. Failure to disenroll an enrollee 
who has moved out of the HMO's or CMP's geographic area does not expand 
that area to encompass the location of the enrollee's new residence.
    (2) Exception. An HMO or CMP may retain a Medicare enrollee who is 
absent from its geographic area for an extended period, but who remains 
within the United States as defined in Sec. 400.200 of this chapter if 
the enrollee agrees. For purposes of this exception, the following 
provisions apply:
    (i) An absence for an extended period means an uninterrupted absence 
from the HMO's or CMP's geographic area for more than 90 days but less 
than 1 year.
    (ii) The HMO or CMP and the enrollee may mutually agree upon 
restrictions for obtaining services while the enrollee is absent for an 
extended period from the HMO's or CMP's geographic area. However, 
restrictions may not be imposed on the scope of services described in 
Sec. 417.440.
    (iii) HMOs and CMPs that choose to exercise this exception must make 
the option available to all Medicare enrollees who are absent for an 
extended period from their geographic areas. However, HMOs and CMPs may 
limit this option to enrollees who go to a geographic area served by an 
affiliated HMO or CMP.
    (iv) As used in this paragraph, ``affiliated HMO or CMP'' means an 
HMO or CMP that--
    (A) Is under common ownership or control of the HMO or CMP that 
seeks to retain the absent enrollees; or
    (B) Has in effect an agreement to furnish services to enrollees who 
are on an extended absence from the geographic area of the HMO or CMP 
that seeks to retain them.
    (v) When the enrollee returns to the HMO's or CMP's geographic area 
(even temporarily), the restrictions of Sec. 417.448(a) (which limit 
payment for services not provided or arranged for by the HMO or CMP) 
apply again immediately.
    (vi) If the enrollee fails to return to the HMO's or CMP's 
geographic area within 1 year from the date he or she left that area, 
the HMO or CMP must disenroll the beneficiary on the first

[[Page 558]]

day of the month following the anniversary of the date the enrollee left 
that area in accordance with paragraph (f)(1) of this section.
    (g) Failure to convert to risk provisions of Medicare contract. (1) 
Basis for disenrollment. A risk HMO or CMP must disenroll a nonrisk 
Medicare enrollee who refuses to convert to the risk provisions of the 
Medicare contract after HCFA determines that all of the HMO's or CMP's 
nonrisk Medicare enrollees must convert.
    (2) Advance notice requirement. At least 30 days before it gives 
HCFA notice of disenrollment, the HMO or CMP must give the enrollee 
written notice of the fact that failure to convert will result in 
disenrollment.
    (h) Loss of entitlement to Medicare benefits. (1) Loss of 
entitlement to Part A benefits. If an enrollee loses entitlement to 
benefits under Part A of Medicare but remains entitled to benefits under 
Part B, the enrollee automatically continues as a Medicare enrollee of 
the HMO or CMP and is entitled to receive and have payment made for Part 
B services, beginning with the month immediately following the last 
month of his or her entitlement to Part A benefits.
    (2) Loss of entitlement to Part B benefits. If a Medicare enrollee 
loses entitlement to Part B benefits, the HMO or CMP must disenroll him 
or her as a Medicare enrollee effective with the month following the 
last month of entitlement to Part B benefits. However, the HMO or CMP 
may continue to enroll the individual under its regular plan if the 
individual so chooses.
    (i) Death of the enrollee. Disenrollment is effective with the month 
following the month of death.

[60 FR 45678, Sept. 1, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 417.461  Disenrollment by the enrollee.

    (a) Request for disenrollment. (1) A Medicare enrollee who wishes to 
disenroll may at any time give the HMO or CMP a signed, dated request in 
the form and manner prescribed by HCFA.
    (2) The enrollee may request a certain disenrollment date but it may 
be no earlier than the first day of the month following the month in 
which the HMO or CMP receives the request.
    (b) Responsibilities of the HMO or CMP. The HMO or CMP must--
    (1) Submit a disenrollment notice to HCFA promptly;
    (2) Provide the enrollee with a copy of the request for 
disenrollment; and
    (3) In the case of a risk HMO or CMP, also provide the enrollee with 
a statement explaining that he or she--
    (i) Remains enrolled until the effective date of disenrollment; and
    (ii) Until that date, is subject to the restrictions of 
Sec. 417.448(a) under which neither the HMO or CMP nor HCFA pays for 
services not provided or arranged for by the HMO or CMP.
    (c) Effect of failure to submit disenrollment notice to HCFA 
promptly. If the HMO or CMP fails to submit timely the correct and 
complete notice required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the HMO or 
CMP must reimburse HCFA for any capitation payments received after the 
month in which payments would have ceased if the requirement had been 
met timely.

[60 FR 45679, Sept. 1, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 417.464  End of HCFA's liability for payment: Disenrollment of beneficiaries and termination or default of contract.

    (a) Effect of disenrollment: General rule. (1) HCFA's liability for 
monthly capitation payments to the HMO or CMP generally ends as of the 
first day of the month following the month in which disenrollment is 
effective, as shown on HCFA's records.
    (2) Disenrollment is effective no earlier than the month immediately 
after, and no later than the third month after, the month in which HCFA 
receives the disenrollment notice in acceptable form.
    (b) Effect of disenrollment: Special rules. (1) Fraud or abuse by 
the enrollee. If disenrollment is on the basis of fraud committed or 
abuse permitted by the enrollee, HCFA's liability ends as of the first 
day of the month in which disenrollment is effective.
    (2) Loss of entitlement to Part B benefits. If disenrollment is on 
the basis of loss of entitlement to Part B benefits, HCFA's liability 
ends as of the first

[[Page 559]]

day of the month following the last month of Part B entitlement.
    (3) Death of enrollee. If the enrollee dies, HCFA's liability ends 
as of the first day of the month following the month of death.
    (4) Disenrollment at enrollee's request. If disenrollment is in 
response to the enrollee's request, HCFA's liability ends as of the 
first day of the month following the month of termination requested by 
the enrollee.
    (c) Effect of termination or default of contract. (1) Termination of 
contract. If the contract between HCFA and the HMO or CMP is terminated 
by mutual consent or by unilateral action of either party, HCFA's 
liability for payments ends as of the first day of the month after the 
last month for which the contract is in effect.
    (2) Default of contract. If the HMO or CMP defaults on the contract 
before the end of the contract year because of bankruptcy or other 
reasons, HCFA--
    (i) Determines the month in which its liability for payments ends; 
and
    (ii) Notifies the HMO or CMP and all affected Medicare enrollees as 
soon as practicable.

[50 FR 1346, Jan. 10, 1985; 50 FR 20570, May 17, 1985, as amended at 56 
FR 8853, Mar. 1, 1991; 58 FR 38079, 38082, July 15, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 417.479  Requirements for physician incentive plans.

    (a) The contract must specify that an HMO or CMP may operate a 
physician incentive plan only if--
    (1) No specific payment is made directly or indirectly under the 
plan to a physician or physician group as an inducement to reduce or 
limit medically necessary services furnished to an individual enrollee; 
and
    (2) The stop-loss protection, enrollee survey, and disclosure 
requirements of this section are met.
    (b) Applicability. The requirements in this section apply to 
physician incentive plans between HMOs and CMP and individual physicians 
or physician groups with which they contract to provide medical services 
to enrollees. The requirements in this section also apply to 
subcontracting arrangements as specified in Sec. 417.479(i). These 
requirements apply only to physician incentive plans that base 
compensation (in whole or in part) on the use or cost of services 
furnished to Medicare beneficiaries or Medicaid recipients.
    (c) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
    Bonus means a payment an HMO or CMP makes to a physician or 
physician group beyond any salary, fee-for-service payments, capitation, 
or returned withhold.
    Capitation means a set dollar payment per patient per unit of time 
(usually per month) that an organization pays a physician or physician 
group to cover a specified set of services and administrative costs 
without regard to the actual number of services provided. The services 
covered may include the physician's own services, referral services, or 
all medical services.
    Payments means any amounts the HMO or CMP pays physicians or 
physician groups for services they furnish directly, plus amounts paid 
for administration and amounts paid (in whole or in part) based on use 
and costs of referral services (such as withhold amounts, bonuses based 
on referral levels, and any other compensation to the physician or 
physician group to influence the use of referral services). Bonuses and 
other compensation that are not based on referral levels (such as 
bonuses based solely on quality of care furnished, patient satisfaction, 
and participation on committees) are not considered payments for 
purposes of this section.
    Physician group means a partnership, association, corporation, 
individual practice association, or other group that distributes income 
from the practice among members. An individual practice association is a 
physician group only if it is composed of individual physicians and has 
no subcontracts with physician groups.

[[Page 561]]

    Physician incentive plan means any compensation arrangement between 
an HMO or CMP and a physician or physician group that may directly or 
indirectly have the effect of reducing or limiting services furnished to 
Medicare beneficiaries or Medicaid recipients enrolled in the HMO or 
CMP.
    Referral services means any specialty, inpatient, outpatient, or 
laboratory services that a physician or physician group orders or 
arranges, but does not furnish directly.
    Risk threshold means the maximum risk, if the risk is based on 
referral services, to which a physician or physician group may be 
exposed under a physician incentive plan without being at substantial 
financial risk.
    Withhold means a percentage of payments or set dollar amounts that 
an HMO or CMP deducts from a physician's service fee, capitation, or 
salary payment, and that may or may not be returned to the physician, 
depending on specific predetermined factors.
    (d) Prohibited physician payments. No specific payment of any kind 
may be made directly or indirectly under the incentive plan to a 
physician or physician group as an inducement to reduce or limit covered 
medically necessary services covered under the HMO's or CMP's contract 
furnished to an individual enrollee. Indirect payments include offerings 
of monetary value (such as stock options or waivers of debt) measured in 
the present or future.
    (e) General rule: Determination of substantial financial risk. 
Substantial financial risk occurs when the incentive arrangements place 
the physician or physician group at risk for amounts beyond the risk 
threshold, if the risk is based on the use or costs of referral 
services. Amounts at risk based solely on factors other than a 
physician's or physician group's referral levels do not contribute to 
the determination of substantial financial risk. The risk threshold is 
25 percent.
    (f) Arrangements that cause substantial financial risk. For purposes 
of this paragraph, potential payments means the maximum anticipated 
total payments (based on the most recent year's utilization and 
experience and any current or anticipated factors that may affect 
payment amounts) that could be received if use or costs of referral 
services were low enough. The following physician incentive plans cause 
substantial financial risk if risk is based (in whole or in part) on use 
or costs of referral services and the patient panel size is not greater 
than 25,000 patients:
    (1) Withholds greater than 25 percent of potential payments.
    (2) Withholds less than 25 percent of potential payments if the 
physician or physician group is potentially liable for amounts exceeding 
25 percent of potential payments.
    (3) Bonuses that are greater than 33 percent of potential payments 
minus the bonus.
    (4) Withholds plus bonuses if the withholds plus bonuses equal more 
than 25 percent of potential payments. The threshold bonus percentage 
for a particular withhold percentage may be calculated using the 
formula--
Withhold %=-0.75 (Bonus %)+25%.
    (5) Capitation, arrangements, if--
    (i) The difference between the maximum potential payments and the 
minimum potential payments is more than 25 percent of the maximum 
potential payments; or
    (ii) The maximum and minimum potential payments are not clearly 
explained in the physician's or physician group's contract.
    (6) Any other incentive arrangements that have the potential to hold 
a physician or physician group liable for more than 25 percent of 
potential payments.
    (g) Requirements for physician incentive plans that place physicians 
at substantial financial risk. HMOs and CMPs that operate incentive 
plans that place physicians or physician groups at substantial financial 
risk must do the following:
    (1) Conduct enrollee surveys. These surveys must--
    (i) Include either all current Medicare/Medicaid enrollees in the 
HMO or CMP and those who have disenrolled (other than because of loss of 
eligibility in Medicaid or relocation outside the HMO's or CMP's service 
area) in the past 12 months, or a sample of these same enrollees and 
disenrollees;
    (ii) Be designed, implemented, and analyzed in accordance with 
commonly accepted principles of survey design and statistical analysis;

[[Page 562]]

    (iii) Address enrollees/disenrollees satisfaction with the quality 
of the services provided and their degree of access to the services; and
    (iv) Be conducted no later than 1 year after the effective date of 
the Medicare contract and at least annually thereafter.
    (2) Ensure that all physicians and physician groups at substantial 
financial risk have either aggregate or per-patient stop-loss protection 
in accordance with the following requirements:
    (i) If aggregate stop-loss protection is provided, it must cover 90 
percent of the costs of referral services (beyond allocated amounts) 
that exceed 25 percent of potential payments.
    (ii) If the stop-loss protection provided is based on a per-patient 
limit, the stop-loss limit per patient must be determined based on the 
size of the patient panel and may be a single combined limit or consist 
of separate limits for professional services and institutional services. 
In determining patient panel size, the patients may be pooled in 
accordance with paragraph (h)(1)(v) of this section. Stop-loss 
protection must cover 90 percent of the costs of referral services that 
exceed the per patient limit. The per-patient stop-loss limit is as 
follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (h) Disclosure requirements for organizations with physician 
incentive plans--(1) Disclosure to HCFA. Each HMO or CMP must provide to 
HCFA information concerning its physician incentive plans as required or 
requested. The disclosure must contain the following information in 
detail sufficient to enable HCFA to determine whether the incentive plan 
complies with the requirements specified in this section:
    (i) Whether services not furnished by the physician or physician 
group are covered by the incentive plan. If only the services furnished 
by the physician or physician group are covered by the incentive plan, 
disclosure of other aspects of the plan need not be made.
    (ii) The type of incentive arrangement; for example, withhold, 
bonus, capitation.
    (iii) If the incentive plan involves a withhold or bonus, the 
percent of the withhold or bonus.
    (iv) Proof that the physician or physician group has adequate stop-
loss protection, including the amount and type of stop-loss protection.
    (v) The panel size and, if patients are pooled, the method used. 
Pooling is permitted only if: it is otherwise consistent with the 
relevant contracts governing the compensation arrangements for the 
physician or physician group; the physician or physician group is at 
risk for referral services with respect to each of the categories of 
patients being pooled; the terms of the compensation arrangements permit 
the physician or physician group to spread the risk across the 
categories of patients being pooled; the distribution of payments to 
physicians from the risk pool is not calculated separately by patient 
category; and the terms of the risk borne by the physician or physician 
group are comparable for all categories of patients being pooled. If 
these conditions are met, the physician or physician group may use 
either or both of the following methods to pool patients:
    (A) Pooling any combination of commercial, Medicare, or Medicaid 
patients enrolled in a specific HMO or CMP in the calculation of the 
panel size.
    (B) Pooling together, by a physician group that contracts with more 
than one HMO, CMP, health insuring organization (as defined in 
Sec. 434.2 of this chapter), or prepaid health plan (as defined

[[Page 563]]

in Sec. 434.2 of this chapter) the patients of each of those entities.
    (vi) In the case of capitated physicians or physician groups, 
capitation payments paid to primary care physicians for the most recent 
year broken down by percent for primary care services, referral services 
to specialists, and hospital and other types of provider (for example, 
nursing home and home health agency) services.
    (vii) In the case of those prepaid plans that are required to 
conduct beneficiary surveys, the survey results.
    (2) When disclosure must be made to HCFA. (i) HCFA will not approve 
an HMO's or CMP's application for a contract unless the HMO or CMP has 
provided to it the information required by paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through 
(h)(1)(v) of this section. In addition, an HMO or CMP must provide this 
information to HCFA upon the effective date of its contract renewal.
    (ii) An HMO or CMP must provide the capitation data required under 
paragraph (h)(1)(vi) for the previous calendar year to HCFA by April 1 
of each year.
    (3) Disclosure to Medicare beneficiaries. An HMO or CMP must provide 
the following information to any Medicare beneficiary who requests it:
    (i) Whether the prepaid plan uses a physician incentive plan that 
affects the use of referral services.
    (ii) The type of incentive arrangement.
    (iii) Whether stop-loss protection is provided.
    (iv) If the prepaid plan was required to conduct a survey, a summary 
of the survey results.
    (i) Requirements related to subcontracting arrangements--(1) 
Physician groups. An HMO or CMP that contracts with a physician group 
that places the individual physician members at substantial financial 
risk for services they do not furnish must do the following:
    (i) Disclose to HCFA any incentive plan between the physician group 
and its individual physicians that bases compensation to the physician 
on the use or cost of services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries or 
Medicaid recipients. The disclosure must include the information 
specified in paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (h)(1)(vii) of this section 
and be made at the times specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
    (ii) Provide adequate stop-loss protection to the individual 
physicians.
    (iii) Conduct enrollee surveys as specified in paragraph (g)(1) of 
this section.
    (2) Intermediate entities. An HMO or CMP that contracts with an 
entity (other than a physician group) for the provision of services to 
Medicare beneficiaries must do the following:
    (i) Disclose to HCFA any incentive plan between the entity and a 
physician or physician group that bases compensation to the physician or 
physician group on the use or cost of services furnished to Medicare 
beneficiaries or Medicaid recipients. The disclosure must include the 
information required to be disclosed under paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through 
(h)(1)(vii) of this section and be made at the times specified in 
paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
    (ii) If the physician incentive plan puts a physician or physician 
group at substantial financial risk for the cost of services the 
physician or physician group does not furnish--
    (A) Meet the stop-loss protection requirements of this subpart; and
    (B) Conduct enrollee surveys as specified in paragraph (g)(1) of 
this section.
    (3) For purposes of paragraph (i)(2) of this section, an entity 
includes, but is not limited to, an individual practice association that 
contracts with one or more physician groups and a physician hospital 
organization.
    (j) Sanctions against the HMO or CMP. HCFA may apply intermediate 
sanctions, or the Office of Inspector General may apply civil money 
penalties described at Sec. 417.500, if HCFA determines that an HMO or 
CMP fails to comply with the requirements of this section.

procedures and practices that--
    (a) Are sufficient to--

[[Page 564]]

    (1) Ensure an audit trail; and

<R05>
Sec. 417.500  Sanctions against HMOs and CMPs.

    (a) Basis for imposition of sanctions. HCFA may impose the 
intermediate sanctions specified in paragraph (d) of this section, as an 
alternative to termination of contract, if HCFA determines that an HMO 
or CMP does one or more of the following:
    (1) Fails substantially to provide the medically necessary services 
required to be provided to a Medicare enrollee and the failure adversely 
affects (or has a substantial likelihood of adversely affecting) the 
enrollee.
    (2) Requires Medicare enrollees to pay amounts in excess of premiums 
permitted.
    (3) Acts, in violation of the provisions of subpart K of this part, 
to expel or to refuse to reenroll an individual.
    (4) Engages in any practice that could reasonably be expected to 
have the effect of denying or discouraging enrollment (except as 
permitted by subpart K of this part) by eligible individuals whose 
medical conditions or histories indicate a need for substantial future 
medical services.
    (5) Misrepresents or falsifies information that it furnishes under 
this part to HCFA, an individual, or to any other entity.
    (6) Fails to comply with the requirements of section 1876(g)(6)(A) 
of the Act relating to the prompt payment of claims.
    (7) Fails to meet the requirement in section 1876(f)(1) of the Act 
that not more than 50 percent of the organization's enrollment be 
Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients.
    (8) Has a Medicare risk contract and--
    (i) Employs or contracts with individuals or entities excluded from 
participation in Medicare under section 1128 or section 1128A of the Act 
for the provision of health care, utilization review, medical social 
work, or administrative services; or
    (ii) Employs or contracts with any entity for the provision of those 
services (directly or indirectly) through an excluded individual or 
entity.
    (9) Fails to comply with the requirements of Secs. 417.479(d) 
through (i) relating to physician incentive plans.
    (b) Notice of sanction and opportunity to respond. (1) Notice of 
sanction. Before imposing the intermediate sanctions specified in 
paragraph (d) of this section, HCFA--
    (i) Sends a written notice to the HMO or CMP stating the nature and 
basis of the proposed sanction; and
    (ii) Sends the OIG a copy of the notice (other than a notice 
regarding the restriction on Medicare and Medicaid enrollees as 
described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section), once the sanction has 
been confirmed following the notice period or the reconsideration.
    (2) Opportunity to respond. HCFA allows the HMO or CMP 15 days from 
receipt of the notice to provide evidence that it has not committed an 
act or failed to comply with a requirement described in paragraph (a) of 
this section, as applicable. HCFA may allow a 15-day addition to the 
original 15 days upon receipt of a written request from the HMO or CMP. 
To be approved, the request must provide a credible explanation of why 
additional time is necessary and be received by HCFA before the end of 
the 15-day period following the date of receipt of the sanction notice. 
HCFA does not grant an extension if it determines that the HMO's or 
CMP's conduct poses a threat to an enrollee's health and safety.
    (c) Informal reconsideration. If, consistent with paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section, the HMO or CMP submits a timely response to HCFA's 
notice of sanction, HCFA conducts an informal reconsideration that:
    (1) Consists of a review of the evidence by a HCFA official who did 
not participate in the initial decision to impose a sanction; and
    (2) Gives the HMO or CMP a concise written decision setting forth 
the factual and legal basis for the decision that affirms or rescinds 
the original determination.

[[Page 568]]

    (d) Specific sanctions. If HCFA determines that an HMO or CMP has 
acted or failed to act as specified in paragraph (a) of this section and 
affirms this determination in accordance with paragraph (c) of this 
section, HCFA may--
    (1) Require the HMO or CMP to suspend acceptance of applications for 
enrollment made by Medicare beneficiaries during the sanction period;
    (2) Suspend payments to the HMO or CMP for Medicare beneficiaries 
enrolled during the sanction period; and
    (3) Require the HMO or CMP to suspend all marketing activities to 
Medicare enrollees.
    (e) Effective date and duration of sanctions--(1) Effective date. 
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, a sanction is 
effective 15 days after the date that the organization is notified of 
the decision to impose the sanction or, if the HMO or CMP timely seeks 
reconsideration under paragraph (c) of this section, on the date 
specified in the notice of HCFA's reconsidered determination.
    (2) Exception. If HCFA determines that the HMO's or CMP's conduct 
poses a serious threat to an enrollee's health and safety, HCFA may make 
the sanction effective on a date before issuance of HCFA's reconsidered 
determination.
    (3) Duration of sanction. The sanction remains in effect until HCFA 
notifies the HMO or CMP that HCFA is satisfied that the basis for 
imposing the sanction has been corrected and is not likely to recur.
    (f) Termination by HCFA. In addition to or as an alternative to the 
sanctions described in paragraph (d) of this section, HCFA may decline 
to renew a HMO's or CMP's contract in accordance with Sec. 417.492(b), 
or terminate the contract in accordance with Sec. 417.494(b).
    (g) Civil money penalties. If HCFA determines that a HMO or CMP has 
committed an act or failed to comply with a requirement described in 
paragraph (a) of this section (with the exception of the requirement to 
limit the percentage of Medicare and Medicaid enrollees described in 
paragraph (a)(7) of this section), HCFA notifies the OIG of that 
determination. HCFA also conveys to the OIG information when it reverses 
or terminates a sanction imposed under this subpart. In accordance with 
the provisions of 42 CFR part 1003, the OIG may impose civil money 
penalties on the HMO or CMP in addition to or in place of the sanctions 
that HCFA may impose under paragraph (d) of this section.

    (a) What constitutes change of ownership. (1) Partnership. The 
removal, addition, or substitution of a partner, unless the partners 
expressly agree otherwise as permitted by applicable State law, 
constitutes a change of ownership.
    (2) Unincorporated sole proprietor. Transfer of title and property 
to another party constitutes change of ownership.
    (3) Corporation. (i) The merger of the HMO's or CMP's corporation 
into another corporation or the consolidation of the HMO or CMP with one 
or more other corporations, resulting in a new corporate body, 
constitutes a change of ownership.

corporation into the HMO's or CMP's corporation, with the HMO or CMP 
surviving, does not ordinarily constitute change of ownership.
    (b) Advance notice requirement. (1) An HMO or CMP that has a 
Medicare contract in effect and is considering or negotiating a change 
in ownership must notify HCFA at least 60 days before the anticipated 
effective date of the change.

it continues to be liable for capitation payments that HCFA makes to it 
on behalf of Medicare enrollees after the date of change of ownership.
    (c) Novation agreement defined. A novation agreement is an agreement 
among the current owner of the HMO or CMP, the prospective new owner, 
and HCFA--

[[Page 569]]

    (1) That is embodied in a document executed and signed by all three 
parties;
    (2) That meets the requirements of Sec. 417.522; and
    (3) Under which HCFA recognizes the new owner as the successor in 
interest to the current owner's Medicare contract.
    (d) Effect of change of ownership without novation agreement. Except 
to the extent provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the effect 
of a change of ownership without a novation agreement is that--
    (1) The existing contract becomes invalid; and
    (2) If the new owner wishes to participate in the Medicare program, 
it must apply for, and enter into, a contract in accordance with subpart 
L of this part.
    (e) Effect of change of ownership with novation agreement. If the

signed copies of the novation agreement containing the provisions 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section, and one copy of other 
relevant documents required by HCFA.
    (3) HCFA's determination. HCFA determines that--
    (i) The proposed new owner is in fact a successor in interest to the 
contract;
    (ii) Recognition of the new owner as a successor in interest to the 
contract is in the best interest of the Medicare program; and
    (iii) The successor organization meets the requirements to qualify 
as an HMO or CMP under subpart J of this part.
    (b) Provisions of a novation agreement. (1) Assumption of contract 
obligations. The new owner must assume all obligations under the 
contract.
    (2) Waiver of right to reimbursement. The previous owner must waive 
its rights to reimbursement for covered services furnished during the 
rest of the current contract period.
    (3) Guarantee of performance. (i) The previous owner must guarantee

       Subpart N--Medicare Payment to HMOs and CMPs: General Rules


<R05>
Sec. 417.524  Payment to HMOs or CMPs: General.

    (a) Basic rule. The payments that HCFA makes to an HMO or CMP under 
this subpart and subparts O and P of this part for furnishing covered 
Medicare services are in place of any payment that HCFA would otherwise 
make to a beneficiary or the HMO or CMP under sections 1814(b) and 
1833(a) of the Act.
    (b) Basis of payment. (1) HCFA pays the HMOs or CMPs on either a 
reasonable cost basis or a risk basis depending on the type of contract 
the HMO or CMP has with HCFA.
    (2) In certain cases a risk HMO or CMP also receives payments on a 
reasonable cost basis for certain Medicare enrollees who retain nonrisk 
status, as provided in Sec. 417.444, after the HMO or CMP enters into a 
risk contract.

Sec. 417.526  Payment for covered services.

    Subpart O of this part set forth the principles that HCFA follows in

authorize a provider to charge, for covered Medicare services for which 
Medicare is not the primary payer are stated in paragraphs (b) and (c)

receives from an HMO or CMP covered services that are also covered under 
State or Federal worker's compensation, automobile medical, or any no-
fault insurance, or any liability insurance policy or plan, including a 
self-insured plan, the HMO or CMP may charge, or authorize a provider 
that furnished the service to charge--
    (1) The insurance carrier, employer, or other entity that is liable 
to pay for these services; or
    (2) The Medicare enrollee, to the extent that he or she has been 
paid by the carrier, employer, or other entity.
    (c) Charge to group health plans (GHPs) or large group health plans 
(LGHPs). An HMO or CMP may charge a GHP or LGHP for covered services it 
furnished to a Medicare enrollee and may charge the Medicare enrollee to 
the extent that he or she has been paid by the GHP or LGHP for these 
covered services if--
    (1) The Medicare enrollee is covered under the plan; and
    (2) Under section 1862(b) of the Act, HCFA is precluded from paying 
for the covered services .
    (d) Responsibilities of HMO or CMP. An HMO or CMP must--
    (1) Identify payers that are primary to Medicare under section 
1862(b) of the Act;
    (2) Determine the amounts payable by these payers; and
    (3) Coordinate the benefits of its Medicare enrollees with these 
payers.

                 Subpart O--Medicare Payment: Cost Basis

    Source:  50 FR 1346, Jan. 10, 1985, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 417.530  Basis and scope.

    This subpart sets forth the principles that HCFA follows to 
determine the amount it pays for services furnished by a cost HMO or CMP 
to its Medicare enrollees. These principles are based on sections 
1861(v) and 1876 of the Act and are, for the most part, the same as 
those set forth--
    (a) In part 412 of this chapter, for paying the costs of inpatient 
hospital services which, for cost HMOs and CMPs, are considered 
``reasonable''

[[Page 571]]

only if they do not exceed the amounts allowed under the prospective 
payment system; and
    (b) In part 413 of this chapter, for the costs of all other covered 
services.

<R05>
Sec. 417.531  Hospice care services.

    (a) If a Medicare enrollee of an HMO or CMP with a reasonable cost 
contract makes an election under Sec. 418.24 of this chapter to receive 
hospice care services, payment for these services is made to the hospice 
that furnishes the services in accordance with part 418 of this chapter.
    (b) While the enrollee's hospice election is in effect, HCFA pays 
the HMO or CMP on a reasonable cost basis for only the following covered 
Medicare services furnished to the Medicare enrollee:
    (1) Services of the enrollee's attending physician if the physician 
is an employee or contractor of the HMO or CMP and is not employed by or 
under contract to the enrollee's hospice.
    (2) Services not related to the treatment of the terminal condition 
for which hospice care was elected or a condition related to the 
terminal condition.

FR 46230, Sept. 6, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 417.532  General considerations.

    (a) Conditions and criteria for payment. (1) The costs incurred by 
the HMO or CMP to furnish services covered by Medicare are reimbursable 
if they are--
    (i) Proper and necessary;
    (ii) Reasonable in amount; and
    (iii) Except as provided in Sec. 417.550, appropriately apportioned 
among the HMO's or CMP's Medicare enrollees, other enrollees, and 
nonenrolled patients.
    (2) In determining fair and equitable payment for the HMOs or CMPs, 
HCFA generally applies the cost payment principles set forth in 
Sec. 413.5 of this chapter.
    (3) In judging whether costs are reasonable, HCFA applies the 
weighted average of the AAPCCs of each class of the HMO's or CMP's 
Medicare enrollees (as defined in Sec. 417.582) for the HMO's or CMP's 
geographic area as an absolute limitation on the total amount payable.
    (b) Method and amount of payment to the HMO or CMP. (1) HCFA makes 
interim per capita payments each month for each Medicare enrollee, 
equivalent to the interim per capita cost rate determined in accordance 
with Sec. 417.570.
    (2) HCFA adjusts the interim per capita rate as necessary during the 
contract period and makes final adjustments at the end of the contract 
period.
    (3) In determining the amount due the HMO or CMP, HCFA deducts from 
the reasonable cost actually incurred by the HMO or CMP for covered 
services furnished to its Medicare enrollees, an amount equal to the 
actuarial value of the applicable Medicare Part A and Part B deductible 
and coinsurance amounts that would have applied to the covered services 
for which payment is being made if these enrollees had not enrolled in 
the HMO or CMP or another HMO or CMP.
    (c) Election by HMO or CMP. An HMO or CMP must elect, on an 
individual provider basis, one of the following methods for payment for 
hospital and SNF services it furnishes to Medicare enrollees:
    (1) Direct payment by HCFA.
    (2) Direct payment by the HMO or CMP.
    (d) Notice of election. The election must be made in writing before 
the beginning of the contract period and is binding for that period.
    (e) Payment by HMO or CMP. If the HMO or CMP elects to pay providers 
directly, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, it must--
    (1) Determine the eligibility of its Medicare enrollees to receive 
covered services through the HMO or CMP;
    (2) Make proper coverage decisions and appropriate payments, in 
accordance with Secs. 421.100 and 421.200 of this chapter, for the 
services furnished to its Medicare enrollees;
    (3) Ensure that providers maintain and furnish appropriate 
documentation of physician certification and recertification, to the 
extent required under subpart B of part 424 of this chapter; and

[[Page 572]]

    (4) Carry out any other procedures required by HCFA.
    (f) Review of HMO's or CMP's bill processing capabilities. If the 
HMO or CMP elects to pay providers directly, HCFA determines whether the 
HMO or CMP has the experience and capability to carry out the 
responsibilities specified in paragraph (e) of this section in an 
efficient and effective manner.
    (g) Direct payment by HCFA. (1) If the HMO or CMP elects to have 
HCFA pay for provider services, HCFA pays each provider on a reasonable 
cost basis or under the PPS system, whichever is appropriate for the 
particular provider under part 412 or part 413 of this chapter.
    (2) In computing the Medicare payment to the HMO or CMP, HCFA 
deducts these payments and any other payments made by the Medicare 
intermediary or carrier on behalf of the HMO or CMP (such as payment for 
emergency or urgently needed services under Sec. 417.558).
    (h) Payment for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries not 
enrolled in the HMO or CMP. HCFA pays the HMO or CMP for services it 
furnishes to Medicare beneficiaries who are not its enrollees through 
the HMO's or CMP's Medicare intermediary or carrier, as appropriate.

<R05>
Sec. 417.533  Part B carrier responsibilities.

    In paying for Part B services furnished to its enrollees by 
suppliers, the HMO or CMP must--
    (a) Determine the eligibility of individuals to receive those 
services through the HMO or CMP;
    (b) Make proper coverage decisions and appropriate payment as 
authorized under Sec. 421.200 of this chapter for the services for which 
its Medicare enrollees are eligible; and
    (c) Carry out any other procedures that HCFA may require.

<R05>
Sec. 417.534  Allowable costs.

    (a) Definition--Allowable costs means the direct and indirect costs, 
including normal standby costs incurred by the HMO or CMP, that are 
proper and necessary for efficient delivery of needed health care 
services. They include the costs of furnishing services to the HMO's or 
CMP's Medicare enrollees, other enrollees, and nonenrolled patients, 
which are typical ``provider'' costs, and costs (such as marketing, 
enrollment, membership, and operation of the HMO or CMP) that are 
peculiar to health care prepayment organizations.
    (b) Basic rules. (1) The allowability of an HMO's or CMP's costs for 
furnishing services is generally determined in accordance with 
principles applicable to provider costs, as set forth in Sec. 417.536.
    (2) The allowability of other costs is determined in accordance with 
principles set forth in Secs. 417.538 through 417.550.
    (3) Costs for covered services for which Medicare is not the primary 
payor, as described in Sec. 417.528, are not allowable.

[50 FR 1346, Jan. 10, 1985, as amended at 58 FR 38082, July 15, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 417.536  Cost payment principles.

    (a) Applicability. Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, the 
principles set forth in parts 412 and 413 of this chapter are applicable 
to the costs incurred by an HMO or CMP or by providers and other 
facilities owned or operated by the HMO or CMP or related to it by 
common ownership or control. The most common examples of these costs are 
set forth in this section.
    (b) Depreciation. An appropriate allowance for depreciation on 
buildings and equipment is an allowable cost, in accordance with 
Secs. 413.134, 413.144, and 413.149 of this chapter.
    (c) Interest expense. Necessary and proper interest on both current 
and capital indebtedness is an allowable cost, in accordance with 
Sec. 413.153 of this chapter.
    (d) Cost of educational activities. An appropriate part of the net 
cost of approved educational activities of a provider or other health 
care facility owned or operated by an HMO or CMP

[[Page 573]]

is an allowable cost in accordance with Sec. 413.85 of this chapter.
    (e) Compensation of owners. An appropriate amount of compensation 
for services of owners is an allowable cost, if the services are 
actually performed and are necessary, as specified in Sec. 413.102 of 
this chapter.
    (f) Bad debts. (1) In accordance with Sec. 413.80 of this chapter, 
bad debts are deductions from revenue and may be included as allowable 
costs only if--
    (i) They are attributable to Medicare deductible and coinsurance 
amounts for which the Medicare enrollee is liable; and
    (ii) The HMO or CMP has made a reasonable, but unsuccessful, effort 
to collect those amounts.
    (2) If all or part of the deductible and coinsurance amounts is 
payable through a monthly premium or other periodic payment, the amount 
allowed as a bad debt may not exceed three times the monthly rate for 
the actuarial value of the deductible and coinsurance amounts, or its 
equivalent, if the periodic payment is on other than a monthly basis.
    (3) Any bad debt related to a service furnished to a Medicare 
enrollee of the HMO or CMP, and claimed on a cost report submitted for 
payment by a provider or other facility reimbursed on a cost basis, may 
not be claimed as a bad debt by the HMO or CMP.
    (g) Charity and courtesy allowances. As specified in Sec. 413.80 of 
this chapter, charity and courtesy allowances are deductions from 
revenue and may not be included as allowable costs.
    (h) Research costs. As specified in Sec. 413.90 of this chapter, 
costs incurred for research purposes, over and above patient care, are 
not allowable costs.
    (i) Value of services of nonpaid workers. The value of services of 
nonpaid workers of an organization is not an allowable cost, except as 
provided in Sec. 413.94 of this chapter.
    (j) Purchase discounts and allowances and refund of expenses. 
Discounts and allowances that an HMO or CMP receives on purchases of 
goods and services and refunds of previous expense payments must be 
deducted from the costs to which they relate, in accordance with 
Sec. 413.98 of this chapter.
    (k) Cost to related entities. (1) The costs of services, facilities, 
or supplies furnished to an HMO or CMP by a related entity are allowable 
at the cost to the related entity in accordance with Sec. 413.17 of this 
chapter.
    (2) An entity is not considered related to the HMO or CMP merely 
because--
    (i) It has a risk or incentive agreement under which the HMO or CMP 
reimburses or compensates the entity for services it furnishes to the 
HMOs' or CMPs' enrollees; or
    (ii) Substantially all the services the entity furnishes are 
furnished to the HMO's or CMP's enrollees.
    (3) However, an entity described in paragraph (k)(2) of this section 
and an HMO or CMP are considered related if either of them is in a 
position to exercise significant management or ownership influence or 
control over the other.
    (l) Return on equity capital of proprietary providers owned by the 
HMO or CMP. An allowance for a reasonable return on equity capital 
invested and used in providing services is allowable in addition to the 
reasonable cost of services furnished by a proprietary provider owned by 
the HMO or CMP. The amount of the allowance is determined in accordance 
with Sec. 413.157 of this chapter.
    (m) Limitations on payment. Medicare payment for covered services 
furnished by entities owned by or operated by, or related to, an HMO or 
CMP paid on a reasonable cost basis is subject to certain provisions of 
parts 412 and 413 of this chapter that pertain to reasonable cost and 
reasonable charge. Those provisions include, but are not necessarily 
limited to, the following:
    (1) For ESRD treatment, the limitations authorized under 
Sec. 413.170 of this chapter.
    (2) For services of physical, occupational, and speech therapists 
and other therapists and nonphysician health specialists, the 
limitations set forth in Sec. 413.106 of this chapter.
    (3) For drugs, the allowable cost as determined under Secs. 405.517 
and 410.29 of this chapter.
    (4) The overall cost limits established in accordance with 
Sec. 413.30 of this chapter.

[[Page 574]]

    (5) The limitation to the lesser of reasonable cost or customary 
charges, as set forth in Sec. 413.13 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 417.538  Enrollment and marketing costs.

    (a) Principle. Costs incurred by an HMO or CMP in performing the 
enrollment and marketing activities described in subpart k of this part 
are allowable.
    (b) Included costs. Allowable enrollment and marketing costs are 
those necessary and proper costs incurred in offering the HMO's or CMP's 
plan to potential enrollees in accordance with this part. Those costs 
include selling, advertising, promotional, and other marketing costs and 
may not exceed an amount that would be incurred by a prudent and cost-
conscious management.
    (c) Application. Enrollment and marketing costs are allowable, 
whether incurred directly by HMO or CMP staff or under contract with 
marketing specialists or other outside consultants.
    (d) Limitation on payment. The relatively higher costs that an HMO 
or CMP is likely to incur in initially offering its plan to Medicare 
beneficiaries are taken into account in determining whether enrollment 
and marketing costs are reasonable in amount. However, if those costs 
exceed amounts that would be paid by prudent management, the excess is 
not allowable.

<R05>
Sec. 417.540  Enrollment costs.

    (a) Principle. Enrollment costs are allowable if incurred in 
maintaining and servicing subscriber contracts for prepayment enrollees.
    (b) Kind of costs included. Enrollment costs include, but are not 
limited to, reasonable costs incurred in connection with maintaining 
statistical, financial, and other data on enrollees.

<R05>
Sec. 417.542  Reinsurance costs.

    Reinsurance costs are not allowable.


<R05>
Sec. 417.544  Physicians' services furnished directly by the HMO or CMP.

    (a) Principles. (1) Compensation paid by an HMO or CMP to physicians 
is an allowable cost to the extent that it is commensurate with the 
compensation paid for similar services performed by similar physicians 
practicing in the same or a similar locality.
    (2) Physician compensation may take various forms, but the aggregate 
compensation allowable must be reasonable in relation to the services 
personally furnished.
    (3) If aggregate physician compensation costs exceed what is 
normally incurred, the excess is not a reasonable cost.
    (b) Application. (1) In determining the allowability of the costs of 
physicians' services, the cost of personal services (for example, 
expenses attributable to salaries, wages, incentive payments, fringe 
benefits) must be distinguished from the cost of nonpersonal services 
(for example, expenses attributable to facilities, equipment, support 
personnel, supplies).
    (2) To be allowable, compensation must be reasonable in relation to 
the personal services furnished.

[50 FR 1346, Jan. 10, 1985, as amended at 58 FR 38082, July 15, 1993; 60

<R05>
Sec. 417.546  Physicians' services and other Part B supplier services furnished under arrangements.

    General principle. The amount paid by an HMO or CMP for physicians' 
services and other Part B supplier services furnished under arrangements 
is an allowable cost to the extent it is reasonable. Costs are 
considered reasonable if they--
    (a) Do not exceed those that a prudent and cost-conscious buyer 
would incur to purchase those services; and
    (b) Are comparable to costs incurred for similar services furnished 
by similar physicians or other suppliers in the same or a similar 
geographic area.

[50 FR 1346, Jan. 10, 1985, as amended at 58 FR 38082, July 15, 1993; 60 
FR 34887, July 5, 1995; 60 FR 45372, Aug. 31, 1995]

[[Page 575]]


<R05>
Sec. 417.548  Provider services through arrangements.

    (a) Principle. The cost incurred by an HMO or CMP for covered 
services furnished under arrangement with a provider is allowable to the 
extent that it would be allowable and payable under parts 412 and 413 of 
this chapter, unless the HMO or CMP petitions HCFA and demonstrates to 
HFCA's satisfaction that payment in excess of the amount authorized 
under parts 412 and 413 of this chapter is justified on the basis of 
advantages gained by the HMO or CMP.
    (b) Application. An advantage gained must represent a real and 
tangible benefit received by the HMO or CMP for the excess cost 
incurred, and any excess payment is subject to other applicable 
requirements of parts 405, 412 and 413 of this chapter, including tests 
of reasonableness.
    (c) Example. In the case of an arrangement an HMO or CMP has with a 
provider that is located outside the HMO's or CMP's geographic area and 
that is not related to the HMO or CMP by common ownership or control, 
payment of the provider's charges to the HMO or CMP (rather than the 
payment amounts determined under part 412 or part 413 of this chapter) 
may be justified in exchange for the advantages of not having to incur 
the administrative costs of determining the provider's reasonable cost 
and of making a more timely final settlement with the HMO or CMP. 
However, repayment of the provider's charges would be acceptable only 
if--
    (1) The provider furnishes services to the HMO's or CMP's enrollees 
infrequently;
    (2) The charges represent an insignificant portion of total Medicare 
reimbursement to the HMO or CMP; and
    (3) The charges do not exceed the customary charges by the provider 
to its other patients for similar services.

<R05>
Sec. 417.550  Special Medicare program requirements.

    (a) Principle. HCFA pays the full reasonable cost incurred by an HMO 
or CMP for activities that are solely for Medicare purposes and unique 
to Medicare contracts under section 1876 of the Act.
    (b) Application. HCFA pays the full reasonable cost of the following 
activities:
    (1) Reporting increases and decreases in the number of Medicare 
enrollees.
    (2) Obtaining independent certification of the HMO's or CMP's cost 
report to the extent that it is for Medicare purposes.
    (3) Reporting special data that HCFA requires solely for program 
planning and evaluation.
    (c) Prior approval requirement. The costs specified in paragraph (b) 
of this section must be separately budgeted and approved by HCFA before 
the contract period begins.
    (d) Limit on full payment. Full payment is limited to the costs 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section. All other administrative 
costs must be apportioned in accordance with Sec. 417.552.

[60 FR 46230, Sept. 6, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 417.552  Cost apportionment: General provisions.

    (a) Basic rule. The HMO or CMP must apportion its total allowable 
direct and indirect costs among its Medicare enrollees, its other 
enrollees, and its nonenrolled patients--
    (1) In accordance with this subpart; and
    (2) Using methods approved by HCFA.
    (b) Purpose of apportionment. The purpose of apportionment is to 
ensure that--
    (1) The cost of services furnished to Medicare enrollees is not 
borne by other enrollees and nonenrolled patients; and
    (2) The cost of the services furnished to other enrollees and 
nonenrolled patients is not borne by Medicare.

    The Medicare share of the cost of covered services furnished to 
Medicare enrollees by providers that are owned or operated by the HMO or 
CMP or are related to the HMO or CMP by common

[[Page 576]]

ownership or control must be determined in accordance with the 
apportionment methods set forth in part 412, Secs. 413.24, 413.55, and 
415.55 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 417.556  Apportionment: Provider services furnished by the HMO or CMP through arrangements with others.

    The Medicare share of the cost of covered services furnished to 
Medicare enrollees through arrangements with providers other than those 
specified in Sec. 417.554 must be determined as follows:
    (a) The Medicare share must be based on the cost the HMO or CMP pays 
the provider under their arrangement, to the extent that cost is 
reasonable and within the limits established by Secs. 417.534 through 
417.548.
    (b) Except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, 
apportionment must be on the same approved basis that is used by the 
provider for Medicare beneficiaries who are not Medicare enrollees of 
the HMO or CMP, subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in 
Sec. 417.548.
    (c) If, because of the special nature or terms of the HMO's or CMP's 
arrangement with the provider, apportionment on the basis specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section would result in Medicare's bearing the 
costs of furnishing services to individuals other than the HMO's or 
CMP's Medicare enrollees, apportionment must be on another basis that is 
approved by HCFA and that will ensure that Medicare does not pay any of 
the cost of furnishing services to individuals who are not Medicare 
enrollees of the HMO or CMP.
    (d) If the HMO or CMP elects to have providers reimbursed by the 
HMO's or CMP's Medicare intermediary, the Medicare share is the amount 
the intermediary paid the provider.

<R05>
Sec. 417.558  Emergency, urgently needed, and out-of-area services for which the HMO or CMP accepts responsibility.

    (a) Source of payment. Either HCFA or the HMO or CMP may pay a 
provider for emergency or urgently needed services or other covered out-
of-area services for which the HMO or CMP accepts responsibility.
    (b) Limits on payment. If the HMO or CMP pays, the payment amount 
may not exceed the amount that is allowable under part 412 or part 413 
of this chapter.
    (c) Exception to limit on payment. Payment in excess of the limit 
imposed by paragraph (b) of this section is allowable only if the HMO or 
CMP demonstrates to HCFA's satisfaction that it is justified on the 
basis of advantages gained by the HMO or CMP, as set forth in 
Sec. 417.548.

[60 FR 46231, Sept. 6, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 417.560  Apportionment: Part B physician and supplier services.

    (a) Medical services furnished directly by the HMO or CMP. The total 
allowable cost of Part B physician and supplier services furnished by 
employees or partners of the HMO or CMP or by a related entity of the 
HMO or CMP must be apportioned on the basis of the ratio of covered Part 
B services furnished to Medicare enrollees to total services furnished 
to all the HMO's or CMP's enrollees and nonenrolled patients. The HMO or 
CMP must use a method for reporting costs that is approved by HCFA. HCFA 
bases its approval on a finding that the method--
    (1) Results in an accurate and equitable allocation of allowable 
costs; and
    (2) Is justifiable from an administrative and cost efficiency 
standpoint.
    (b) Medical services furnished under arrangements made by the HMO or 
CMP. When the HMO or CMP pays for Part B physician and supplier services 
on some basis other than fee-for-service, the reasonable cost the HMO or 
CMP pays under its financial arrangement with the physician or supplier 
must be apportioned between Medicare enrollees and others based on the 
ratio of covered services furnished to Medicare

[[Page 577]]

enrollees to the total services furnished to all enrollees and 
nonenrolled patients. If apportionment on this basis would result in 
Medicare bearing the cost of furnishing services to individuals who are 
not Medicare enrollees, the Medicare share must be determined on another 
basis (approved by HCFA) to ensure that Medicare pays only for services 
furnished to Medicare enrollees.
    (c) Medical services furnished under an arrangement that provides 
for the HMO or CMP to pay on a fee-for-service basis. The Medicare share 
of the cost of Part B physician and supplier services furnished to 
Medicare enrollees under arrangements, and paid for by the HMO or CMP on 
a fee-for-service basis, is determined by multiplying the total amount 
for all such services by the ratio of charges for covered services 
furnished to Medicare enrollees to the total charges for all such 
services.
    (d) Emergency services, urgently needed services, and other covered 
medical services for which the HMO or CMP assumes financial 
responsibility. The Medicare share of the cost of Part B emergency or 
urgently needed services or other Part B services that are not furnished 
by a provider and for which the HMO or CMP accepts financial 
responsibility is determined in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) 
of this section.

Sec. 417.564  Apportionment and allocation of administrative and general costs.

    (a) Costs not directly associated with providing medical care. 
Enrollment, marketing, and other administrative and general costs that 
benefit the total enrollment of the HMO or CMP and are not directly 
associated with furnishing medical care must be apportioned on the basis 
of a ratio of Medicare enrollees to the total HMO or CMP enrollment.
    (b) Costs significantly related to providing medical services. (1) 
The following administrative and general costs, which bear a significant 
relationship to the services furnished, are not apportioned to Medicare 
directly; they must be allocated or distributed to the HMO or CMP 
components and then apportioned to Medicare in accordance with 
Secs. 417.552 through 417.560:
    (i) Facility costs.
    (ii) Interest expense.
    (iii) Medical record costs.
    (iv) Centralized purchasing costs.
    (v) Accounting and data processing costs.
    (vi) Other administrative and general costs that are not included in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) The allocation or distribution process must be as follows:
    (i) If a separate entity or department of an HMO or CMP performs 
administrative functions the benefit of which can be quantitatively 
measured (such as centralized purchasing and data processing), the total 
allowable costs of this entity or department must be allocated or 
distributed to the components of the HMO or CMP in reasonable proportion 
to the benefits received by these components.
    (ii) If a separate entity or department of an HMO or CMP performs 
administrative functions the benefit of which cannot be quantitatively 
measured (such as facility costs), the total allowable costs of this 
entity or department must be allocated or distributed to the components 
of the HMO or CMP on the basis of a ratio of total incurred and 
distributed costs per component to the total incurred and distributed 
costs for all components.

<R05>
Sec. 417.566  Other methods of allocation and apportionment.

    (a) Justification. A method of apportionment or allocation of costs, 
other than the methods prescribed in this subpart may be used if it 
results in a more accurate and equitable apportionment of allowable 
costs and is justifiable from an administrative and cost standpoint.
    (b) Required approval. (1) An HMO or CMP that desires to use an 
alternative method must submit a written request for HCFA approval at 
least 90 days before the beginning of the period for which the different 
method is to be used.
    (2) If HCFA approves use of a different method, the HMO or CMP may

[[Page 578]]

not revert to another method without first obtaining HCFA's approval.

[50 FR 1346, Jan. 10, 1985, as amended at 58 FR 38082, July 15, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 417.568  Adequate financial records, statistical data, and cost finding.

    (a) Maintenance of records. (1) An HMO or CMP must maintain 
sufficient financial records and statistical data for proper 
determination of costs payable by HCFA for covered services the HMO or 
CMP furnished to its Medicare enrollees either directly or under 
arrangements with others. These include accurate and sufficient detail 
of incurred costs and enrollment data.
    (2) Unless otherwise provided for in this subpart, the HMO or CMP 
must follow standardized definitions and accounting, statistics, and 
reporting practices that are widely accepted in the health care 
industry.
    (b) Provision of data. (1) The HMO or CMP must provide adequate cost 
and statistical data, based on its financial and statistical records, 
that can be verified by qualified auditors.
    (2) The cost data must be based on an approved method of cost 
finding and, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, on 
the accrual method of accounting.
    (3) For governmental institutions that use a cash basis of 
accounting, cost data developed on this basis is acceptable. However, 
only depreciation on capital assets, rather than the expenditure for the 
capital asset, is allowable.
    (c) Provider services furnished directly by the HMO or CMP. If the 
HMO or CMP furnishes provider services directly, the provider is subject 
to the cost-finding and cost-reporting requirements set forth in parts 
412 and 413 of this chapter. The provider must use an approved cost-
finding method described in Sec. 413.24 of this chapter to determine the 
actual cost of these covered services.
    (d) Supplier services furnished directly by the HMO or CMP. If the 
HMO or CMP furnishes Part B physician and supplier services directly, it 
must furnish statistics that indicate the frequency and type of service 
provided, in the form and detail prescribed by HCFA.
    (e) Part B physician and supplier services furnished through 
arrangement. If the HMO or CMP furnishes Part B physician and supplier 
services under arrangements with others, it must furnish to HCFA 
statistical, financial, and other information with respect to those 
services in the form and detail prescribed by HCFA.

<R05>
Sec. 417.570  Interim per capita payments.

    (a) Principle of payment. (1) HCFA makes monthly advance payments 
equivalent to the HMO's or CMP's interim per capita rate for each 
beneficiary who is registered in HCFA records as a Medicare enrollee of 
the HMO or CMP.
    (2) Additional lump-sum payments may be made at other times during 
the contract period, at HCFA's discretion, to adjust the total amounts 
paid during the contract period to the level of incurred costs.
    (b) Determination of rate. The interim per capita rate of payment is 
equal to the estimated per capita cost of providing covered services to 
the HMO's or CMP's Medicare enrollees, based upon the types and 
components of costs that are reimbursable under this part. The interim 
per capita rate is determined annually by HCFA on the basis of the HMO's 
or CMP's annual operating and enrollment forecast (as set forth in 
Sec. 417.572) and may be revised during the contract period as explained 
in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
    (c) Adjustments of payments. In order to maintain the interim 
payments at the level of current reasonable costs, HCFA will adjust the 
interim per capita rate, to the extent necessary, on the basis of 
adequate data supplied by the HMO or CMP in its interim estimated cost 
and enrollment reports or on other evidence showing that the rate based 
on actual costs is more or less than the current rate. Adjustments may 
also be made if there is--
    (1) A change in the number of Medicare enrollees that affects the 
per capita rate;
    (2) A material variation from the costs estimated when the annual 
operating budget was prepared; or

[[Page 579]]

    (3) A significant change in the use of covered services by the HMO's 
or CMP's Medicare enrollees.
    (d) Reduction of interim payments. If the HMO or CMP does not 
submit, on time, the reports and other data required to determine the 
proper amount of payment, HCFA may reduce interim payments to the extent 
appropriate, or may take any other action authorized under this part. An 
interim payment reduction remains in effect until HCFA can make a 
reasonable estimate of per capita costs.

[50 FR 1346, Jan. 10, 1985, as amended at 58 FR 38082, July 15, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 417.572  Budget and enrollment forecast and interim reports.

    (a) Annual submittal. The HMO or CMP must submit an annual operating 
budget and enrollment forecast, in the form and detail required by HCFA, 
at least 90 days before the beginning of each contract period. The 
forecast must be based on financial and statistical data and records 
that can be verified if HCFA requires a detailed review of supporting 
records. The data and records include, but are not limited to, all 
ledgers, books, records, and original evidence of costs, and statistical 
data used in the determination of reasonable cost.
    (b) Effect of failure to submit on time. If the HMO or CMP does not 
submit the budget and enrollment forecast on time, HCFA may--
    (1) Establish an interim per capita rate of payment on the basis of 
the best available data and adjust payments on the basis of that rate 
until the required reports are submitted and a new interim per capita 
rate can be established; or
    (2) If there is not enough data on which to base an interim per 
capita rate, inform the HMO or CMP that interim payments will not be 
made until the required reports are submitted.
    (c) Interim cost reports. (1) An HMO or CMP must submit interim cost 
reports on a quarterly basis in the form and detail prescribed by HCFA. 
These interim cost reports must be submitted no later than 60 days after 
the close of each quarter of the contract period.
    (2) HCFA may reduce the frequency of the reports required under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section if HCFA determines that, on the basis 
of the HMO's or CMP's reporting experience, there is good cause to do 
so.

<R05>
Sec. 417.574  Interim settlement.

    (a) Determination. Within 30 days following the receipt of the HMO's 
or CMP's final interim cost and enrollment reports, HCFA will make an 
interim determination of the estimated amount payable to the HMO or CMP 
for the reasonable cost of covered services furnished to its Medicare 
enrollees during the contract period. HCFA will base the determination 
on the interim cost report and enrollment data submitted by the HMO or 
CMP, and any other relevant data HCFA finds appropriate. For this 
purpose, HCFA will accept costs as reported, subject to later review or 
audit, unless there are obvious errors or inconsistencies.
    (b) Payment. Any difference between the total amount of interim 
payments and the amount found payable on the basis of the interim 
determination under paragraph (a) of this section, must be paid by the 
HMO or CMP or will be paid by HCFA, whichever is appropriate, no later 
than 30 days after HCFA's determination.

[50 FR 1346, Jan. 10, 1985, as amended at 58 FR 38082, July 15, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 417.576  Final settlement.

    (a) General rule. Final settlement and payment of amounts due the 
HMO or CMP or the appropriate Medicare trust funds are made following 
the HMO's or CMP's submission and HCFA's review of an independently 
certified cost report and supporting documents as described in paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (b) Certified cost report as basis for final settlement--(1) Timing 
of cost report. The HMO or CMP must submit to HCFA an independently 
certified cost report and supporting documents, in the form and detail 
required by HCFA, no later than 180 days after the end of each contract 
period, unless HCFA extends the period for good cause shown by the HMO 
or CMP.

[[Page 580]]

    (2) Content of cost report. The cost report and supporting documents 
must include the following:
    (i) The per capita costs incurred in furnishing covered services to 
its Medicare enrollees, determined in accordance with subpart O of this 
part and including--
    (A) The costs incurred by entities related to the HMO or CMP by 
common ownership or control; and
    (B) For reports for cost-reporting periods that begin on or after 
January 1, 1996, the costs of hospital and SNF services paid by 
Medicare's intermediaries under the option provided by Sec. 417.532(d).
    (ii) The HMO's or CMP's methods of apportioning cost among Medicare 
enrollees, and nonenrolled patients, in accordance with the payment 
procedures specified in this subpart (as, applicable, in parts 412 and 
413 of this chapter); and
    (iii) Any other information required by HCFA.
    (3) Failure to report required financial information. If the HMO or 
CMP fails to submit the required cost report and supporting documents 
within 180 days (or an extended period approved by HCFA under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section), HCFA may--
    (i) Consider the failure to report as evidence of likely 
overpayment; and
    (ii) Initiate recovery of amounts previously paid, or reduce interim 
payments, or both.
    (c) Final determination and adjustment. (1) After receipt of 
acceptable reports as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, HCFA 
determines the total payment due the HMO or CMP for furnishing covered 
services to its Medicare enrollees (which is subject to the audit 
provisions of this subpart) and makes a retroactive adjustment to bring 
interim payments into agreement with the payable amount due the HMO or 
CMP.
    (2) A final settlement may be made with the HMO or CMP even though a 
provider that is not owned or operated by the HMO or CMP or related to 
the HMO or CMP by common ownership or control and that provides services 
to the HMO's or CMP's Medicare enrollees has not had a final settlement 
with HCFA under parts 412 and 413 of this chapter for services furnished 
by the provider to Medicare beneficiaries who are not enrolled in the 
HMO or CMP. In this situation--
    (i) HCFA must be satisfied that the costs of covered services 
furnished to the HMO's or CMP's Medicare enrollees, as shown in the 
reports specified in paragraph (b) of this section, are reasonable and 
that the interest of the Medicare program would best be served by not 
delaying final settlement with the HMO or CMP until there is a final 
settlement with the provider for services furnished to Medicare 
beneficiaries not enrolled in the HMO or CMP; and
    (ii) Prompt settlement with the HMO or CMP would be in the best 
interest of the Medicare program if, for instance, the provider's costs 
represent an insignificant portion of total payment due to the HMO or 
CMP; or if HCFA is satisfied that the provider's costs, as shown in the 
reports specified in paragraph (b) of this section, will not be 
modified, to any significant extent, by the final settlement with the 
provider under parts 412 and 413 of this chapter.
    (d) Notice of amount of payment. The notice of amount of Medicare 
payment--
    (1) Explains HCFA's determination regarding total Medicare payment 
due the HMO or CMP for the contract period covered by the financial 
information specified in paragraph (b) of this section;
    (2) Relates this determination to the HMO's or CMP's claimed total 
payable cost for that period;
    (3) Explains the amounts and reasons, by appropriate reference to 
law, regulations, and Medicare program policy and procedures, if the 
determined amounts differ from the HMO's or CMP's claim; and
    (4) Informs the HMO or CMP of its right to a hearing in accordance 
with subpart R of part 405 of this chapter.
    (e) Basis for retroactive adjustment.
    (1) HCFA's determination (as contained in the notice of amount of 
Medicare payment) constitutes the basis for making retroactive 
adjustments to any Medicare payment made to the HMO or CMP during the 
period to which the determination applies.
    (2) Further payments to the HMO or CMP may be withheld or offset in 
order

[[Page 581]]

to recover, or to aid in the recovery of, any overpayment identified in 
the determination as having been made to the HMO or CMP, even if the HMO 
or CMP requests a hearing under subpart R of part 405 of this chapter.
    (3) Any withholding continues until the earliest of the following 
occurs:
    (i) The overpayment is liquidated.
    (ii) The HMO or CMP enters into an agreement with HCFA to refund the 
overpaid amount.
    (iii) HCFA, on the basis of subsequently acquired information, 
determines that there was no overpayment.
    (iv) The decision of a hearing specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this 
section is that there was no overpayment.

Sec. 417.582  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart--
    AAPCC stands for adjusted average per capita cost.
    ACR stands for adjusted community rate.
    Actuarial factors means factors such as the age, sex, and disability 
level distribution of the population and any other relevant factors that 
HCFA determines have a significant effect on the level of utilization 
and cost of health services.
    APCRP stands for average of per capita rates of payment.
    Class of Medicare enrollees means a group of Medicare enrollees of 
an HMO or CMP that HCFA constructs on the basis of actuarial factors.
    Similar area means an area similar to the HMO's or CMP's geographic 
area but free from special characteristics that would distort the 
determination of the AAPCC.
    U.S. per capita incurred cost means the average per capita cost, 
including intermediary or carrier administrative costs, incurred by 
Medicare, as determined on an accrual basis, for covered services 
furnished to Medicare beneficiaries nationwide during the most recent

Sec. 417.584  Payment to HMOs or CMPs with risk contracts.

    Except in the circumstances specified in Sec. 417.440(d) for 
inpatient hospital care, and as provided in Sec. 417.585 for hospice 
care, HCFA makes payment for covered services only to the HMO or CMP.
    (a) Principle of payment. HCFA makes monthly advance payments 
equivalent to the HMO's or CMP's per capita rate of payment for each 
beneficiary who is registered in HCFA records as a Medicare enrollee of 
the HMO or CMP.
    (b) Determination of rate. (1) The annual per capita rate of payment 
for each class of Medicare enrollees is equal to 95 percent of the AAPCC 
(as determined under the provisions of Sec. 417.588) for that class of 
Medicare enrollees.
    (2) HCFA furnishes each HMO or CMP with its per capita rate of 
payment for each class of Medicare enrollees not later than 90 days 
before the beginning of the HMO's or CMP's contract period.
    (c) Adjustments to payments. If the actual number of Medicare 
enrollees differs from the estimated number on which the amount of 
advance monthly

[[Page 582]]

payment was based, HCFA adjusts subsequent monthly payments to take 
account of the difference.
    (d) Reduction of payments. If an HMO or CMP requests a reduction in 
its monthly payment in accordance with Sec. 417.592(b)(2), HCFA reduces 
the amount of payment by the appropriate amount.

<R05>
Sec. 417.585  Special rules: Hospice care.

    (a) No payment is made to an HMO or CMP on behalf of a Medicare 
enrollee who has elected hospice care under Sec. 418.24 of this chapter 
except for the portion of the payment applicable to the additional 
benefits described in Sec. 417.592. This no-payment rule is effective 
from the first day of the month following the month of election to 
receive hospice care, until the first day of the month following the 
month in which the enrollee resumes normal Medicare coverage.
    (b) During the time the election is in effect, the HMO or CMP may 
bill HCFA on a fee-for-service basis (subject to the usual Medicare 
rules of payment) but only for the following covered Medicare services:
    (1) Services of the enrollee's attending physician if the physician 
is an employee or contractor of the HMO or CMP and is not employed by or 
under contract to the enrollee's hospice.
    (2) Services not related to the treatment of the terminal condition 
for which the enrollee elected hospice care or a condition related to 
the terminal condition.
    (3) Services furnished after the revocation or expiration of the 
enrollee's hospice election until the full monthly capitation payments 
begin again.
    (c) Payment for hospice care services furnished to Medicare 
enrollees of an HMO or CMP is made to the Medicare-participating hospice 
elected by the enrollee.

<R05>
Sec. 417.588  Computation of adjusted average per capita cost (AAPCC).

    (a) Basic data. In computing the AAPCC, HCFA uses the U.S. per 
capita incurred cost and adjusts it by the factors specified in 
paragraph (c) of this section to establish an AAPCC for each class of 
Medicare enrollees.
    (b) Advance notice to the HMO or CMP. Before the beginning of a 
contract period, HCFA informs the HMO or CMP of the specific adjustment 
factors it will use in computing the AAPCC.
    (c) Adjustment factors. (1) Geographic. HCFA makes an adjustment to 
reflect the relative level of Medicare expenditures for beneficiaries 
who reside in the HMO's or CMP's geographic area (or a similar area). 
This adjustment is based on reimbursement for Medicare covered services 
and uses the most accurate and timely data that pertain to the HMO's or 
CMP's geographic area and that is available to HCFA when it makes the 
determination.
    (2) Enrollment. HCFA makes a further adjustment to remove the cost 
effect of all area Medicare beneficiaries who are enrolled in the HMO or 
CMP or another HMO or CMP.
    (3) Age, sex, and disability status. HCFA makes adjustments to 
reflect the age and sex distribution and the disability status of the 
HMO's or CMP's enrollees based on Medicare program experience and 
available data that indicate cost differences that result from those 
factors.
    (4) Other relevant factors. If accurate data are available and 
appropriate, HCFA makes adjustments to reflect welfare and institutional 
status and other relevant factors.

<R05>
Sec. 417.590  Computation of the average of the per capita rates of payment.

    (a) Computation by the HMO or CMP. As indicated in Sec. 417.584(b), 
before an HMO's or CMP's contract period begins, HCFA determines a per 
capita rate of payment for each class of the HMO's or CMP's Medicare 
enrollees. In order to determine the additional benefits required under 
Sec. 417.592, weighted averages of those per capita rates must be 
computed separately for enrollees

[[Page 583]]

entitled to Part A and Part B, and for enrollees entitled only to Part 
B. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the HMO or CMP 
must make the computations.
    (b) Computation by HCFA. If the HMO or CMP claims to have 
insufficient enrollment experience to make the computations required by 
paragraph (a) of this section, and HCFA agrees with the claim, HCFA 
makes the computations, using the best available information, which may 
include the enrollment experience of other risk HMOs and CMPs.

Sec. 417.592  Additional benefits requirement.

    (a) General rules. (1) An HMO or CMP that has an APCRP (as 
determined under Sec. 417.590) greater than its ACR (as determined under 
Sec. 417.594) must elect one of the options specified in paragraph (b) 
of this section.
    (2) The dollar value of the elected option must, over the course of 
a contract period, be at least equal to the difference between the APCRP 
and the proposed ACR.
    (b) Options. (1) Additional benefits. Provide its Medicare enrollees 
with additional benefits in accordance with paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (2) Payment reduction. Request HCFA to reduce its monthly payments.
    (3) Combination of additional benefits and payment reduction. 
Provide fewer than the additional benefits required under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section and request HCFA to reduce the monthly payments 
by the remaining difference between the APCRP and the ACR.
    (4) Combination of additional benefits and withholding in a 
stabilization fund. Provide fewer than the additional benefits required 
under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and request HCFA to withhold in 
a stabilization fund (as provided in Sec. 417.596) the remaining 
difference between the APCRP and the ACR.
    (c) Special rules: Additional benefits option. (1) The HMO or CMP 
must determine additional benefits separately for enrollees entitled to 
both Part A and Part B benefits and those entitled only to Part B.
    (2) The HMO or CMP may elect to provide additional benefits in any 
of the following forms--
    (i) A reduction in the HMO's or CMP's premium or in other charges it 
imposes in the form of deductibles or coinsurance.
    (ii) Health benefits in addition to the required Part A and Part B 
covered services.
    (iii) A combination of reduced charges and additional benefits.
    (d) Notification to HCFA. (1) The HMO or CMP must give HCFA notice 
of its ACR and its weighted APCRP at least 45 days before its contract 
period begins.
    (2) An HMO or CMP that elects the option of providing additional 
benefits must include in its submittal--
    (i) A description of the additional benefits it will provide to its 
Medicare enrollees; and
    (ii) Supporting evidence to show that the selected benefits meet the 
requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section with respect to dollar 
value equivalence.

<R05>
Sec. 417.594  Computation of adjusted community rate (ACR).

    (a) Basic rule. Each HMO or CMP must compute its basic rate as 
follows:
    (1) Compute an initial rate in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (2) Adjust and reduce the initial rate in accordance with paragraphs 
(c) and (d) of this section.
    (b) Computation of initial rates. (1) The HMO or CMP must compute 
its initial rate using either of the following systems:
    (i) A community rating system as defined in Sec. 417.104(b); or
    (ii) A system, approved by HCFA, under which the HMO or CMP develops 
an aggregate premium for all its enrollees and weights the aggregate by 
the size of the various enrolled groups that compose its enrollment.

(For purposes of this section, enrolled groups are defined as employee 
groups or other bodies of subscribers that enroll in the HMO or CMP 
through payment of premiums.)
    (2) Regardless of which method the HMO or CMP uses--

[[Page 584]]

    (i) The initial rate must be equal to the premium it would charge 
its non-Medicare enrollees for the Medicare-covered services;
    (ii) The HMO or CMP must compute the rates separately for enrollees 
entitled to Medicare Part A and Part B and for those entitled only to 
Part B; and
    (iii) The HMO or CMP must identify and take into account anticipated 
revenue from health insurance payers for those services for which 
Medicare is not the primary payer as provided in Sec. 417.528.
    (3) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the HMO 
or CMP must identify in its initial rate calculation, the following 
components whose rates must be consistent with rates used by the HMO or 
CMP in calculating premiums for non-Medicare enrollees:
    (i) Hospital services (services covered under Medicare Part A and 
Part B shown separately).
    (ii) Physicians' services.
    (iii) Other medical services (for example, X-ray and laboratory 
services).
    (iv) Home health services.
    (v) Out-of-plan claims for emergency services.
    (vi) Skilled nursing care services.
    (vii) Ambulance services.
    (viii) Other Medicare covered services.
    (ix) General and administrative.
    (x) Noncovered Medicare services (for example, eyeglasses).
    (xi) Services for which Medicare is the secondary payer.
    (xii) Enrollee liabilities (for example, deductibles, coinsurance, 
or copayments) for covered services.
    (4) An HMO or CMP that does not usually separate its premium 
components as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section may 
calculate its initial rate with the methods it uses for its other 
enrolled groups if the HMO or CMP provides HCFA with the documentation 
necessary to support any adjustments the HMO or CMP makes to the initial 
rate in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
    (5) The initial rate calculation must not carry forward any losses 
experienced by the HMO or CMP during prior contract periods. The HMO or 
CMP must submit supporting documentation to assure HCFA that rates do 
not include past losses but only premiums for the price of additional 
benefits and services of the upcoming contract period.
    (c) Adjustment of initial rates. (1) Purpose of adjustment. The 
purpose of adjustment is to reflect the utilization characteristics of 
Medicare enrollees.
    (2) Adjustment by the HMO or CMP. The HMO or CMP may adjust the rate 
for a particular service using more than one of the following factors if 
they do not duplicate each other:
    (i) Unit of service. If the HMO or CMP purchases or identifies 
services on a unit of service basis and the unit of service is defined 
the same for all enrollees, the HMO or CMP may make an adjustment in its 
initial rate to reflect the number of units of services furnished to its 
Medicare enrollees in comparison to those furnished to other enrollees.
    (ii) Complexity or intensity of services. The HMO or CMP may make an 
adjustment to reflect the differences in the complexity or intensity of 
services furnished to its Medicare enrollees if the calculation of its 
initial rate includes the elements of this adjustment.
    (3) Support documentation. All adjustments made by the HMO or CMP 
must be accompanied by adequate supporting data. If an HMO or CMP does 
not have sufficient enrollment experience to develop this data, it may, 
during its initial contract period, use documented statistics from a 
nationally recognized statistical source.
    (4) Adjustment by HCFA. If the HMO or CMP does not have adequate 
data to adjust the initial rate calculated under paragraph (b) of this 
section to reflect the utilization characteristics of its Medicare 
enrollees, HCFA will, at the HMO's or CMP's request, adjust the initial 
rate. HCFA adjusts the rate on the basis of differences in the 
utilization characteristics of--
    (i) Medicare and non-Medicare enrollees in other HMOs or CMPs; or
    (ii) Medicare beneficiaries (in the HMO's or CMP's area, or State, 
or the United States) who are eligible to enroll in an HMO or CMP and 
other individuals in that same area, or State, or the United States.

[[Page 585]]

    (d) Reduction of adjusted rates. The HMO or CMP or HCFA further 
reduces the adjusted rates by the actuarial value of applicable Medicare 
deductibles and coinsurance.
    (e) HCFA review. (1) Submission of data. The HMO or CMP must submit 
its ACR and the methodology used to compute it for HCFA review and 
approval, and must include adequate supporting data.
    (2) Appeals procedures. (i) If HCFA determines that an HMO's or 
CMP's ACR computation is not acceptable, the HMO or CMP may, within 30 
days after receipt of notice of the determination, file with HCFA a 
request for a hearing.
    (ii) The request must state why the HMO or CMP believes the 
determination is incorrect, and include any supporting evidence the HMO 
or CMP considers pertinent.
    (iii) A hearing officer designated by HCFA conducts the hearing in 
accordance with the hearing procedures set forth in Secs. 405.1819 
through 405.1833 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 417.596  Establishment of a benefit stabilization fund.

    (a) General. If an HMO or CMP is required to provide its Medicare 
enrollees with additional benefits as described in Sec. 417.592, the 
organization may request that HCFA withhold a part of its monthly per 
capita payment in a benefit stabilization fund. The fund will be used to 
prevent excessive fluctuation in the provision of those additional 
benefits in subsequent contract periods.
    (b) Notification to HCFA. An HMO's or CMP's request to have monies 
withheld in a benefit stabilization fund must be made when the HMO or 
CMP notifies HCFA under Sec. 417.592(d) of its ACR and its APCRP in 
preparation for its next contract period.
    (c) Limitations on the amounts withheld--(1) Limit per contract 
period. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, HCFA 
does not withhold in a benefit stabilization fund more than 15 percent 
of the difference between an HMO's or CMP's ACR and its ACPRP for a 
given contract period.
    (2) Cumulative limit. If HCFA has established a benefit 
stabilization fund for an HMO or CMP, it does not approve a request for 
withholding made by that HMO or CMP for a subsequent contract period 
that would cause the total value of the benefit stabilization fund to 
exceed 25 percent of the difference between the HMO's or CMP's ACR and 
the average of its per capita rates of payment for that subsequent 
contract period.
    (3) Exception. HCFA may grant an exception to the limit described in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section if an HMO or CMP can demonstrate to 
HCFA's satisfaction that the value of the additional benefits it 
provides to its Medicare enrollees fluctuates substantially in excess of 
15 percent from one contract period to another.
    (d) Financial management of benefit stabilization funds. (1) The 
amounts withheld by HCFA to establish and maintain a benefit 
stabilization fund are in the custody of the Federal Health Insurance 
Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund.
    (2) The amounts withheld in a benefit stabilization fund are 
accounted for by HCFA in accounts in which interest does not accrue to 
the HMO or CMP.

<R05>
Sec. 417.597  Withdrawal from a benefit stabilization fund.

    (a) Notification to HCFA. An HMO's or CMP's request to make a 
withdrawal from its benefit stabilization fund for use during a contract 
period must be made when the HMO or CMP notifies HCFA of its ACR and its 
ACPRP for that contract period. In making its request, the HMO or CMP 
must--
    (1) Indicate how it intends to use the withdrawn amounts;
    (2) Justify the need for the withdrawal in terms of stabilizing the 
additional benefits it provides to Medicare enrollees;
    (3) Document the HMO's or CMP's experience with fluctuations of 
revenue requirements relative to the additional benefits it provides to 
Medicare enrollees; and

[[Page 586]]

    (4) Document its experience during the contract period previous to 
the one for which it requests withdrawal to ensure that the HMO or CMP 
will not be using the withdrawn amounts to refinance losses suffered 
during that previous contract period.
    (b) Criteria for HCFA approval. HCFA approves a request for a 
withdrawal from a benefit stabilization fund for use during the next 
contract period only if--
    (1) The HMO's or CMP's average of its per capita rates of payment 
for the next contract period is less than that of the previous contract 
period;
    (2) The HMO's or CMP's ACR for the next contract period is 
significantly higher than that of the previous contract period; or
    (3) The HMO's or CMP's revenue requirements for the next contract 
period for providing the additional benefits it provided during the 
previous contract period is significantly higher than the requirements 
for that previous period and the ACR for the next contract period 
results in an additional benefits package that is less in total value 
than that of the previous contract period.
    (c) Basis for denial. HCFA does not approve a request for a 
withdrawal from a benefit stabilization fund if the withdrawal would 
allow the HMO or CMP to--
    (1) Offer without charge the supplemental services it provides to 
its Medicare enrollees under the provisions of Sec. 417.440 (b)(2) or 
(b)(3); or
    (2) Refinance prior contract period losses or to avoid losses in the 
upcoming contract period.
    (d) Form of payment. Payment of monies withdrawn from a benefit 
stabilization fund is made, in equal parts, as an additional amount to 
the monthly advance payment made to the HMO or CMP under Sec. 417.584 
during the period of the contract.

<R05>
Sec. 417.598  Annual enrollment reconciliation.

    HCFA's payment to an HMO or CMP may be subject to an enrollment 
reconciliation at least annually. HCFA conducts this reconciliation as 
necessary to ensure that the payments made do not exceed or fall short 
of the appropriate per capita rate of payment for each Medicare enrollee 
of the HMO or CMP during the contract period. The HMO or CMP must submit 
any information or reports required by HCFA to conduct the 
reconciliation.

<R05>
Sec. 417.605  Immediate PRO review of a determination of noncoverage of inpatient hospital care.

    (a) Right to review. A Medicare enrollee who disagrees with a 
determination made by an HMO, CMP, or a hospital that inpatient care is 
no longer necessary may remain in the hospital and may (directly or 
through his or her authorized representative) request immediate PRO 
review of the determination.
    (b) Procedures. For the immediate PRO review process, the following 
rules apply:
    (1) The enrollee or authorized representative must submit the 
request for immediate review--
    (i) To the PRO that has an agreement with the hospital under 
Sec. 466.78 of this chapter;
    (ii) In writing or by telephone; and
    (iii) By noon of the first working day after receipt of the written 
notice of the determination that the hospital stay is no longer 
necessary.
    (2) On the date it receives the enrollee's request, the PRO must 
notify the HMO or CMP that a request for immediate review has been 
filed.

[[Page 588]]

    (3) The HMO or CMP must supply any information that the PRO requires 
to conduct its review and must make it available, by phone or in 
writing, by the close of business of the first full working day 
immediately following the day the enrollee submits the request for 
review.
    (4) In response to a request from the HMO or CMP, the hospital must 
submit medical records and other pertinent information to the PRO by 
close of business of the first full working day immediately following 
the day the HMO or CMP makes its request.
    (5) The PRO must solicit the views of the enrollee who requested the 
immediate PRO review (or the enrollee's representative).
    (6) The PRO must make a determination and notify the enrollee, the

review determination.
    (2) Exception. The hospital may not charge the HMO or CMP (or the 
enrollee) if--
    (i) It was the hospital (acting on behalf of the enrollee) that 
filed the request for immediate PRO review; and
    (ii) The PRO upholds the noncoverage determination made by the HMO 
or CMP.

<R05>
Sec. 417.606  Organization determinations.

    (a) Actions that are organization determinations. An organization 
determination is any determination made by an HMO or CMP with respect to 
any of the following:
    (1) Payment for emergency or urgently needed services.
    (2) Any other health services furnished by a provider or supplier 
other than the HMO or CMP that the enrollee believes--
    (i) Are covered under Medicare; and
    (ii) Should have been furnished, arranged for, or reimbursed by the 
HMO or CMP.
    (3) The HMO's or CMP's refusal to provide services that the enrollee 
believes should be furnished or arranged for by the HMO or CMP and the 
enrollee has not received the services outside the HMO or CMP.
    (4) Discontinuation of a service (such as a skilled nursing facility 
discharge), if the enrollee disagrees with the determination that the 
service is no longer medically necessary.
    (b) Actions that are not organization determinations. The following 
are not organization determinations for purposes of this subpart:
    (1) A determination regarding services that were furnished by the 
HMO or CMP, either directly or under arrangement, for which the enrollee 
has no further obligation for payment.

for services; or
    (2) As specified in Sec. 417.609(c)(3) for expedited organization

orally to the HMO or CMP.
    (b) The HMO or CMP must maintain procedures for expediting 
organization determinations when, upon request from an enrollee or 
authorized representative of the enrollee, the organization decides that 
making the determination according to the procedures and time frames set

72 hours of the request. An extension of up to 10 working days is 
permitted if requested by the enrollee or if the HMO or CMP finds that 
additional information is necessary and the delay is in the interest of 
the enrollee.
    (i) Notification must comply with Sec. 417.608(b), concerning the 
content of a notice of adverse organization determination.
    (ii) If the initial notification is not in writing, written 
confirmation must be mailed to the enrollee within 2 working days.

    Source:  50 FR 1375, Jan. 10, 1985, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 417.800  Payment to HCPPs: Definitions and basic rules.

    (a) Definitions. As used in this subpart, unless the context 
indicates otherwise--
    Covered Part B services means physicians' services, diagnostic X-ray 
tests, laboratory, other diagnostic tests, and any additional medical 
and other health services, that the HCPP furnishes to its Medicare 
enrollees.
    Health care prepayment plan (HCPP) means an organization that--
    (1) Is responsible for the organization, financing and delivery of 
covered Part B services to a defined population on a prepayment basis;
    (2) Meets the conditions specified in paragraph (b) of this section; 
and
    (3) Elects to be reimbursed on a reasonable cost basis.
    Medicare enrollee means a beneficiary under Part B of Medicare who 
has been identified on HCFA records as an enrollee of the HCPP. 
Reporting period means the period specified by HCFA for which an HCPP 
must report its costs and utilization.
    (b) Qualifying conditions. (1) Except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, an organization wishing to participate as an 
HCPP must--
    (i) Enter into a written agreement with HCFA as specified in 
Sec. 417.801;
    (ii) Furnish physicians' services through its employees or under a 
formal arrangement with a medical group, independent practice 
association or individual physicians; and
    (iii) Furnish covered Part B services to its Medicare enrollees 
through institutions, entities, and persons that have qualified under 
the applicable requirements of title XVIII of the Social Security Act 
and section 353 of the PHS Act.
    (2) An organization that, as of January 31, 1983, was being 
reimbursed on a reasonable cost basis under section 1833(a)(1)(A) of the 
Act, and that would not otherwise meet the conditions specified in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, may receive reimbursement on a 
reasonable cost basis as an HCPP, provided it files an agreement with 
HCFA as required by Sec. 417.801.
    (c) Payment of reasonable cost. (1) Except as otherwise provided in 
this subpart, HCFA pays an HCPP on the basis of the reasonable cost it 
incurs, as specified in subpart O of this part, for the covered Part B 
services furnished to its Medicare enrollees.
    (2) Payment for Part B services: Basic rules. (i) Cost basis 
payment. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, HCFA pays 
an HCPP on the basis of the reasonable costs it incurs, as specified in 
subpart O of this part, for the covered Part B services furnished to its 
Medicare enrollees.
    (ii) Deductions. In determining the amount due an HCPP for covered 
Part B services furnished to its Medicare enrollees, HCFA deducts, from 
the reasonable cost actually incurred by the HCPP, the following:
    (A) The actuarial value of the Part B deductible.
    (B) An amount equal to 20 percent of the cost incurred for any 
service that is subject to the Medicare coinsurance.
    (d) Covered services not reimbursed to an HCPP. (1) Services 
reimbursed under Part A are not reimbursable to an HCPP. HCFA makes 
payment for these services directly to the hospital, or other provider 
of services, on a reasonable cost basis through the provider's Medicare 
fiscal intermediary (for more details, see parts 412 and 413 of this 
chapter).
    (2) Covered Part B services furnished by a provider of services to 
an HCPP's Medicare enrollees are not payable to the HCPP. HCFA makes 
payment for these services to the provider on behalf of the Medicare 
enrollee through the provider's Medicare fiscal intermediary. This 
requirement does not affect Medicare payment to the HCPP for physicians' 
services furnished to its Medicare enrollees for which the physicians 
are compensated by the HCPP.
    (e) Payment for services to nonenrollees. HCFA makes payment to an 
HCPP for covered Part B services furnished by the HCPP to a Medicare 
beneficiary who is not enrolled in the HCPP if the

[[Page 598]]

beneficiary assigns his rights to payment in accordance with Sec. 424.55 
of this chapter. Payment is made on a reasonable charge basis through 
the HCPP's Medicare carrier.

    (a) General requirement. (1) In order to participate and receive 
payment under the Medicare program as an HCPP as defined in 
Sec. 417.800, an organization must enter into a written agreement with 
HCFA.
    (2) An existing group practice prepayment plan (GPPP) that continues 
as an HCPP under this subpart U must have entered into a written 
agreement with HCFA within 60 days of January 31, 1983.

    (1) Maintain compliance with the requirements for participation and 
reimbursement on a reasonable cost basis of HCPPs as specified in 
Sec. 417.800;
    (2) Not charge the Medicare enrollee or any other person for items 
or services for which that enrollee is entitled to have payment made 
under the provisions of this part, except for any deductible or 
coinsurance amounts for which the enrollee is liable;
    (3) Refund, as promptly as possible, any money incorrectly collected 
as charges or premiums, or in any other way from Medicare enrollees in 
the HCPP in accordance with the requirements specified in Sec. 417.456;
    (4) Not impose any limitations on the acceptance of Medicare 
enrollees or beneficiaries for care and treatment that it does not 
impose on all other individuals;
    (5) Meet the advance directives requirements specified in 
Sec. 417.436(d) of this part;
    (6) Establish administrative review procedures in accordance with 
Secs. 417.830 through 417.840 for Medicare enrollees who are 
dissatisfied with denied services or claims; and
    (7) Consider any additional requirements that HCFA finds necessary 
or desirable for efficient and effective program administration.
    (c) Duration of agreement. Except for the term of the initial 
agreement, the agreement is for a term of one year and may be renewed 
annually by mutual consent. The term of the initial agreement is set by 
HCFA.
    (d) Termination or nonrenewal of agreement by HCFA. (1) HCFA may 
terminate or not renew an agreement if it determines that--
    (i) The HCPP no longer meets the requirements for participation and 
reimbursement as an HCPP as specified in Sec. 417.800;
    (ii) The HCPP is not in substantial compliance with the provisions 
of the agreement, applicable HCFA regulations, or applicable provisions 
of the Medicare law; or
    (iii) The HCPP undergoes a change in ownership as specified in 
subpart M of this part.
    (2) HCFA will give notice of termination or nonrenewal to the HCPP 
at least 90 days before the effective date stated in the notice.
    (e) Termination or nonrenewal of agreement by HCPP. (1) If an HCPP 
does not wish to renew its agreement at the end of the term, it must 
give written notice to HCFA at least 90 days before the end of the term 
of the agreement. If an HCPP wishes to terminate its agreement before 
the end of the term, it must file a written notice with HCFA stating the 
intended effective date of termination.
    (2) HCFA may approve the termination date proposed by the HCPP, or 
set a different date no later than 6 months after that date. HCFA makes 
this decision based on a finding that termination on a specific date 
would not--
    (i) Unduly disrupt the furnishing of services to the community 
serviced by the HCPP; or
    (ii) Otherwise interfere with the efficient administration of the 
Medicare program.

<R05>
Sec. 417.802  Allowable costs.

    (a) General rule. The costs that are considered allowable for HCPP 
reimbursement are the same as those for reasonable cost HMOs and CMPs 
specified in subpart O of this part, except those in Secs. 417.531, 
417.532 (a)(3) and (c) through (g), 417.536 (l) and (m), 417.546, 
417.548, and 417.550(b)(2).
    (b) Physicians' services and other Part B supplier services 
furnished under arrangements--(1) Principle. The amount paid by an HCPP 
for physicians' services and other Part B supplier services furnished 
under arrangements is an allowable cost to the extent it is reasonable.
    (2) Application: Payment on other than a fee-for-service basis. If 
the HCPP pays for physicians' services and other Part B supplier 
services on other than a fee-for-service basis--
    (i) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the 
costs incurred by the HCPP may be considered reasonable if they--
    (A) Do not exceed those that a prudent and cost-conscious buyer 
would incur to purchase those services; and
    (B) Are comparable to costs incurred for similar services furnished 
by similar physicians and other suppliers in the same or a similar 
locality.
    (ii)(A) If a physician group to whom the HCPP makes payment 
compensates its physicians on a fee-for-service basis, the HCPP's 
payment to the group may not exceed the reasonable charges for those 
services, as defined in subpart E of part 405 of this chapter.
    (B) Payment in excess of the limits specified in paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section is allowable if the group has procedures 
under which members of the group accept effective incentives, such as 
risk-sharing, designed to avoid unnecessary or unduly costly utilization 
of health services. In such cases, the amount paid by the HCPP is 
considered reasonable if it meets the conditions specified in paragraph 
(b)(2)(i) of this section.
    (3) Application: Payment on a fee-for-service basis. If the HCPP 
pays for physicians' services and other Part B supplier services on a 
fee-for-service basis--
    (i) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the 
costs incurred by the HCPP are considered reasonable if they do not 
exceed--
    (A) The reasonable charges for those services, as defined in subpart 
E of part 405 of this chapter; and
    (B) The amount that HCFA would pay for those services if they were 
furnished to beneficiaries who are not enrolled in the HCPP and who 
receive the services from sources other than providers of services or 
other entities that are reimbursed on a reasonable cost basis.
    (ii) Payment to a physician group organized on an individual-
practice basis is not subject to the paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section 
if the group pays its physicians on a fee-for-service basis and has 
procedures under which the members of the group accept effective 
incentives, such as risk-sharing, designed to avoid unnecessary or 
unduly costly utilization of health services. In these cases, the amount 
paid by an HCPP is considered reasonable if it meets the conditions 
specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.

    (a) The HCPP follows the cost apportionment principles specified in 
Secs. 417.552 through 417.566, except for provisions on provider costs 
and provisions on departmental apportionment.
    (b) The HCPP may use a method for reporting costs that is approved 
by HCFA. HCFA bases its approval on a finding that the method--
    (1) Results in an accurate and equitable allocation of allowable 
costs; and
    (2) Is justifiable from an administrative and cost efficiency 
standpoint.


<R05>
Sec. 417.806  Financial records, statistical data, and cost finding.

    (a) The principles specified in Sec. 417.568 apply to HCPPs, except 
those in paragraph (c) of that section.
    (b) The HCPP may use a method for reporting costs that is approved 
by HCFA. HCFA bases its approval on a finding that the method--

standpoint.

[[Page 600]]

    (c) An HCPP must permit the Department and the Comptroller General 
to audit or inspect any books and records of the HCPP and of any related 
organization that pertain to the determination of amounts payable for 
covered Part B services furnished its Medicare enrollees. For purposes 
of this requirement, the principles specified in Sec. 417.486 apply to 
HCPPs.

<R05>
Sec. 417.808  Interim per capita payments.

    The HCPP follows the principles specified in Secs. 417.570 and 
417.572 on interim per capita payments, except for the following:
    (a) When applying these principles to HCPPs, the term ``reporting 
period'' should be used instead of the term ``contract period'' 
contained in that section.
    (b) An HCPP must submit to HCFA an annual operating budget and 
enrollment forecast, in the form and detail specified by HCFA, at least 
60 days before the beginning of each reporting period. A reporting 
period must be 12 consecutive months, except that the HCPP's initial 
reporting period for participating in Medicare may be as short as 6 
months or as long as 18 months.
    (c) An HCPP must submit to HCFA an interim cost report and 
enrollment data applicable to the first 6-month period of the HCPP's 
reporting period in the form and detail specified by HCFA. The interim 
cost report must be submitted not later than 45 days after the close of 
the first 6-month period of the HCPP's reporting period.
    (d) In lieu of an interim payment based on the actual monthly 
enrollment in an HCPP, HCFA and the HCPP may agree to a uniform monthly 
interim reimbursement rate for a reporting period. This interim rate is 
based on the HCPP's budget and enrollment forecast, if HCFA is satisfied 
that the rate is consistent with efficiency and economy, and will not 
result in excessive adjustment at the end of the reporting period.


<R05>
Sec. 417.810  Final settlement.

    (a) General requirement. HCFA and an HCPP must make a final 
settlement, and payment of amounts due either to the HCPP or to HCFA, 
following the submission and review of the HCPP's annual cost report and 
the supporting documents specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Annual cost report as basis for final settlement--(1) Form and 
due date. An HCPP must submit to HCFA a cost report and supporting 
documents in the form and detail specified by HCFA, no later than 120 
days following the close of a reporting period.
    (2) Contents. The report must include--
    (i) The HCPP's per capita incurred costs of providing covered Part B 
services to its Medicare enrollees during the reporting period, 
including any costs incurred by another organization related to the HCPP 
by common ownership or control;
    (ii) The HCPP's methods of apportioning costs among its Medicare 
enrollees, enrollees who are not Medicare beneficiaries, and other 
nonenrollees, including Medicare beneficiaries receiving health care 
services on a fee-for-service or other basis; and
    (iii) Information on enrollment and other data as specified by HCFA.
    (3) Extension of time to submit cost report. HCFA may grant an HCPP 
an extension of time to submit a cost report for good cause shown.
    (4) Failure to report required financial information. If an HCPP 
does not submit the required cost report and supporting documents within 
the time specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and has not 
requested and received an extension of time for good cause shown, HCFA 
may--
    (i) Regard the failure to report this information as evidence of 
likely overpayment and reduce or suspend interim payments to the HCPP; 
and
    (ii) Determine that amounts previously paid are overpayments, and 
make appropriate recovery.
    (c) Determination of final settlement. Following the HCPP's 
submission of the reports specified in paragraph (b) of this section in 
acceptable form, HCFA makes a determination of the total reimbursement 
due the HCPP for the reporting period and the difference, if any, 
between this amount and the total interim payments made to the HCPP. 
HCFA sends to the HCPP a notice of

[[Page 601]]

the amount of reimbursement by the Medicare program. This notice--
    (1) Explains HCFA's determination of total reimbursement due the 
HCPP for the reporting period; and
    (2) Informs the HCPP of its right to have the determination reviewed 
at a hearing as provided in part 405, subpart R of this chapter.
    (d) Payment of amounts due. (1) Within 30 days of HCFA's 
determination, HCFA or the HCPP, as appropriate, will make payment of 
any difference between the total amount due and the total interim 
payments made to the HCPP by HCFA.
    (2) If the HCPP does not pay HCFA within 30 days of HCFA's 
determination of any amounts the HCPP owes HCFA, HCFA may offset further 
payments to the HCPP to recover, or to aid in the recovery of, any 
overpayment identified in its determination.
    (3) Any offset of payments HCFA makes under paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section will remain in effect even if the HCPP has requested a hearing 
on the determination under the provisions of part 405, subpart R of this 
chapter.
    (e) Tentative settlement. (1) If a final settlement cannot be made 
within 90 days after the HCPP submits the report specified in paragraph 
(b) of this section, HCFA will make an interim settlement by estimating 
the amount payable to the HCPP.
    (2) HCFA or the HCPP will make payment within 30 days of HCFA's 
determination under the tentative settlement of any estimated amounts 
due.
    (3) The tentative settlement is subject to adjustment at the time of 
a final settlement.

Sec. 417.937  Loan and loan guarantee provisions.

    (a) Disbursement of loan proceeds. The principal amount of any loan 
made or guaranteed by the Secretary under this subpart was disbursed to 
the entity in accordance with an agreement entered into between the 
parties to the loan and approved by the Secretary.
    (b) Length and maturity of loans. The principal amount of each loan 
or loan guarantee, together with interest thereon, is repayable over a 
period of 22 years, beginning on the date of endorsement of the loan, or 
loan guarantee by the Secretary. The Secretary could approve a shorter 
repayment period if he or she determined that a repayment period of less 
than 22 years is more appropriate to an entity's total financial plan.
    (c) Repayment. The principal amount of each loan or loan guarantee, 
together with interest thereon is repayable in accordance with a 
repayment schedule that is agreed upon by the parties to the loan or 
loan guarantee and approved by the Secretary before or at the time of 
endorsement of the loan. Unless otherwise specifically authorized by the 
Secretary, each loan made or guaranteed by the Secretary is repayable in 
substantially level combined installments of principal and interest to 
be paid at intervals not less frequently than annually, sufficient in 
amount to amortize the loan through the final year of the life of the 
loan. Principal repayment during the first 60 months of operation could 
be deferred with payment of interest only during that period. The 
Secretary could set rates of interest for each disbursement at a rate 
comparable to the rate of interest prevailing on the date of 
disbursement for marketable obligations of the United States of 
comparable maturities, adjusted to provide for appropriate 
administrative charges.

is considered to be the location of its central office. The hospice must 
provide evidence that it was operational on or before January 1, 1983, 
and that it made a good faith effort to hire a sufficient number of 
nurses to provide services directly. HCFA bases its decision as to 
whether to approve a waiver application on the following:

non-urbanized areas.
    (2) Evidence that a hospice was operational on or before January 1, 
1983 including:
    (i) Proof that the organization was established to provide hospice 
services on or before January 1, 1983;
    (ii) Evidence that hospice-type services were furnished to patients 
on or before January 1, 1983; and
    (iii) Evidence that the hospice care was a discrete activity rather 
than an aspect of another type of provider's patient care program on or 
before January 1, 1983.
    (3) Evidence that a hospice made a good faith effort to hire nurses, 
including:
    (i) Copies of advertisements in local newspapers that demonstrate 
recruitment efforts;
    (ii) Job descriptions for nurse employees;
    (iii) Evidence that salary and benefits are competitive for the 
area; and
    (iv) Evidence of any other recruiting activities (e.g., recruiting 
efforts at health fairs and contacts with nurses at other providers in 
the area);
    (b) Any waiver request is deemed to be granted unless it is denied 
within 60 days after it is received.
    (c) Waivers will remain effective for one year at a time.
    (d) HCFA may approve a maximum of two one-year extensions for each 
initial waiver. If a hospice wishes to receive a one-year extension, the 
hospice must submit a certification to HCFA, prior to the expiration of 
the waiver period, that the employment market for nurses has not changed 
significantly since the time the initial waiver was granted.

<R05>
Sec. 418.202  Covered services.

    (e) The intermediary makes payment according to the following 
procedures:
    (1) Payment is made to the hospice for each day during which the 
beneficiary is eligible and under the care of the hospice, regardless of 
the amount of services furnished on any given day.
    (2) Payment is made for only one of the categories of hospice care 
described in Sec. 418.302(b) for any particular day.
    (3) On any day on which the beneficiary is not an inpatient, the 
hospice is paid the routine home care rate, unless the patient receives 
continuous care as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for a 
period of at least 8 hours. In that case, a portion of the continuous 
care day rate is paid in accordance with paragraph (e)(4) of this 
section.
    (4) The hospice payment on a continuous care day varies depending on 
the number of hours of continuous services provided. The continuous home 
care rate is divided by 24 to yield an hourly rate. The number of hours 
of continuous care provided during a continuous

[[Page 618]]

home care day is then multiplied by the hourly rate to yield the 
continuous home care payment for that day. A minimum of 8 hours of care 
must be furnished on a particular day to qualify for the continuous home 
care rate.
    (5) Subject to the limitations described in paragraph (f) of this 
section, on any day on which the beneficiary is an inpatient in an 
approved facility for inpatient care, the appropriate inpatient rate 
(general or respite) is paid depending on the category of care 
furnished. The inpatient rate (general or respite) is paid for the date 
of admission and all subsequent inpatient days, except the day on which 
the patient is discharged. For the day of discharge, the appropriate 
home care rate is paid unless the patient dies as an inpatient. In the 
case where the beneficiary is discharged deceased, the inpatient rate 
(general or respite) is paid for the discharge day. Payment for 
inpatient respite care is subject to the requirement that it may not be 
provided consecutively for more than 5 days at a time. Payment for the 
sixth and any subsequent day of respite care is made at the routine home 
care rate.
    (f) Payment for inpatient care is limited as follows: (1) The total 
payment to the hospice for inpatient care (general or respite) is 
subject to a limitation that total inpatient care days for Medicare 
patients not exceed 20 percent of the total days for which these 
patients had elected hospice care.
    (2) At the end of a cap period, the intermediary calculates a 
limitation on payment for inpatient care to ensure that Medicare payment 
is not made for days of inpatient care in excess of 20 percent of the 
total number of days of hospice care furnished to Medicare patients.
    (3) If the number of days of inpatient care furnished to Medicare 
patients is equal to or less than 20 percent of the total days of 
hospice care to Medicare patients, no adjustment is necessary. Overall 
payments to a hospice are subject to the cap amount specified in 
Sec. 418.309.
    (4) If the number of days of inpatient care furnished to Medicare 
patients exceeds 20 percent of the total days of hospice care to 
Medicare patients, the total payment for inpatient care is determined in 
accordance with the procedures specified in paragraph (f)(5) of this 
section. That amount is compared to actual payments for inpatient care, 
and any excess reimbursement must be refunded by the hospice. Overall 
payments to the hospice are subject to the cap amount specified in 
Sec. 418.309.
    (5) If a hospice exceeds the number of inpatient care days described 
in paragraph (f)(4), the total payment for inpatient care is determined 
as follows:
    (i) Calculate the ratio of the maximum number of allowable inpatient 
days to the actual number of inpatient care days furnished by the 
hospice to Medicare patients.
    (ii) Multiply this ratio by the total reimbursement for inpatient 
care made by the intermediary.
    (iii) Multiply the number of actual inpatient days in excess of the 
limitation by the routine home care rate.
    (iv) Add the amounts calculated in paragraphs (f)(5)(ii) and (iii) 
of this section.

included in the rates described in Sec. 418.302:
    (1) General supervisory services of the medical director.
    (2) Participation in the establishment of plans of care, supervision 
of care and services, periodic review and updating of plans of care, and

hospice. Reimbursement for these physician services is included in the 
amount subject to the hospice payment limit described in Sec. 418.309. 
Services furnished voluntarily by physicians are not reimbursable.

[[Page 619]]

    (c) Services of the patient's attending physician, if he or she is 
not an employee of the hospice or providing services under arrangements 
with the hospice, are not considered hospice services and are not 
included in the amount subject to the hospice payment limit described in 
Sec. 418.309. These services are paid by the carrier under the 
procedures in subparts D or E, part 405 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 418.306  Determination of payment rates.

    (a) Applicability. HCFA establishes payment rates for each of the 
categories of hospice care described in Sec. 418.302(b). The rates are 
established using the methodology described in section 1814(i)(1)(C) of 
the Act.
    (b) Payment rates. The payment rates for routine home care and other 
services included in hospice care are as follows:
    (1) The following rates, which are 120 percent of the rates in 
effect on September 30, 1989, are effective January 1, 1990 through 
September 30, 1990 and October 21, 1990 through December 31, 1990:

                                                                        
                                                                        
                                                                        
Routine home care.............................................    $75.80
Continuous home care:                                                   
  Full rate for 24 hours......................................    442.40
  Hourly rate.................................................     18.43
Inpatient respite care........................................     78.40
General inpatient care........................................    337.20
                                                                        

    (2) Except for the period beginning October 21, 1990, through 
December 31, 1990, the payment rates for routine home care and other 
services included in hospice care for Federal fiscal years 1991, 1992, 
and 1993 and those that begin on or after October 1, 1997, are the 
payment rates in effect under this paragraph during the previous fiscal 
year increased by the market basket percentage increase as defined in 
section 1886(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act, otherwise applicable to 
discharges occurring in the fiscal year. The payment rates for the 
period beginning October 21, 1990, through December 31, 1990, are the 
same as those shown in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (3) For Federal fiscal years 1994 through 1997, the payment rate is 
the payment rate in effect during the previous fiscal year increased by 
a factor equal to the market basket percentage increase minus--
    (i) 2 percentage points in FY 1994;
    (ii) 1.5 percentage points in FYs 1995 and 1996; and
    (iii) 0.5 percentage points in FY 1997.
    (c) Adjustment for wage differences. HCFA will issue annually, in 
the Federal Register, a hospice wage index based on the most current 
available HCFA hospital wage data, including any changes to the 
definitions of Metropolitan Statistical Areas. The payment rates 
established by HCFA are adjusted by the intermediary to reflect local 
differences in wages according to the revised wage index.
    (d) Federal Register notices. HCFA publishes as a notice in the 
Federal Register any proposal to change the methodology for determining 
the payment rates.

<R05>
Sec. 418.307  Periodic interim payments.

    Subject to the provisions of Sec. 413.64(h) of this chapter, a 
hospice may elect to receive periodic interim payments (PIP) effective 
with claims received on or after July 1, 1987. Payment is made biweekly 
under the PIP method unless the hospice requests a longer fixed interval 
(not to exceed one month) between payments. The biweekly interim payment 
amount is based on the total estimated Medicare payments for the 
reporting period (as described in Secs. 418.302-418.306). Each payment 
is made 2 weeks after the end of a biweekly period of service as 
described in Sec. 413.64(h)(5) of this chapter. Under certain 
circumstances that are described in Sec. 413.64(g) of this chapter, a 
hospice that is not receiving PIP may request an accelerated payment.

Sec. 418.308  Limitation on the amount of hospice payments.

    (a) Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the total 
Medicare payment to a hospice for care furnished during a cap period is 
limited by the hospice cap amount specified in Sec. 418.309.

[[Page 620]]

    (b) Until October 1, 1986, payment to a hospice that began operation 
before January 1, 1975 is not limited by the amount of the hospice cap 
specified in Sec. 418.309.
    (c) The intermediary notifies the hospice of the determination of 
program reimbursement at the end of the cap year in accordance with 
procedures similar to those described in Sec. 405.1803 of this chapter.
    (d) Payments made to a hospice during a cap period that exceed the 
cap amount are overpayments and must be refunded.

<R05>
Sec. 418.309  Hospice cap amount.

    The hospice cap amount is calculated using the following procedures:
    (a) The cap amount is $6,500 per year and is adjusted for inflation 
or deflation for cap years that end after October 1, 1984, by using the 
percentage change in the medical care expenditure category of the 
Consumer Price Index (CPI) for urban consumers that is published by the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics. This adjustment is made using the change in 
the CPI from March 1984 to the fifth month of the cap year. The cap year 
runs from November 1 of each year until October 31 of the following 
year.
    (b) Each hospice's cap amount is calculated by the intermediary by 
multiplying the adjusted cap amount determined in paragraph (a) of this 
section by the number of Medicare beneficiaries who elected to receive 
hospice care from that hospice during the cap period. For purposes of 
this calculation, the number of Medicare beneficiaries includes--
    (1) Those Medicare beneficiaries who have not previously been 
included in the calculation of any hospice cap and who have filed an 
election to receive hospice care, in accordance with Sec. 418.24, from 
the hospice during the period beginning on September 28 (35 days before 
the beginning of the cap period) and ending on September 27 (35 days 
before the end of the cap period).
    (2) In the case in which a beneficiary has elected to receive care 
from more than one hospice, each hospice includes in its number of 
Medicare beneficiaries only that fraction which represents the portion 
of a patient's total stay in all hospices that was spent in that 
hospice. (The hospice can obtain this information by contacting the 
intermediary.)


<R05>
Sec. 418.310  Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

    Hospices must provide reports and keep records as the Secretary 
determines necessary to administer the program.


<R05>
Sec. 418.311  Administrative appeals.

    A hospice that believes its payments have not been properly 
determined in accordance with these regulations may request a review 
from the intermediary or the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB) 
if the amount in controversy is at least $1,000 or $10,000, 
respectively. In such a case, the procedure in 42 CFR part 405, subpart 
R, will be followed to the extent that it is applicable. The PRRB, 
subject to review by the Secretary under Sec. 405.1874 of this chapter, 
shall have the authority to determine the issues raised. The methods and 
standards for the calculation of the payment rates by HCFA are not 
subject to appeal.

<R05>
Sec. 418.400  Individual liability for coinsurance for hospice care.

    An individual who has filed an election for hospice care in 
accordance with Sec. 418.24 is liable for the following coinsurance 
payments. Hospices may charge individuals the applicable coinsurance 
amounts.
    (a) Drugs and biologicals. An individual is liable for a coinsurance 
payment for each palliative drug and biological prescription furnished 
by the hospice while the individual is not an inpatient. The amount of 
coinsurance for each prescription approximates 5 percent of the cost of 
the drug or biological to the hospice determined in accordance with the 
drug copayment schedule established by the hospice, except that the 
amount of coinsurance for each prescription may not exceed $5. The cost 
of the drug or biological may not exceed what a prudent buyer would pay 
in similar circumstances.

[[Page 621]]

The drug copayment schedule must be reviewed for reasonableness and 
approved by the intermediary before it is used.
    (b) Respite care. (1) The amount of coinsurance for each respite 
care day is equal to 5 percent of the payment made by HCFA for a respite 
care day.
    (2) The amount of the individual's coinsurance liability for respite 
care during a hospice coinsurance period may not exceed the inpatient 
hospital deductible applicable for the year in which the hospice 
coinsurance period began.
    (3) The individual hospice coinsurance period--
    (i) Begins on the first day an election filed in accordance with 
Sec. 418.24 is in effect for the beneficiary; and
    (ii) Ends with the close of the first period of 14 consecutive days 
on each of which an election is not in effect for the beneficiary.


<R05>
Sec. 418.402  Individual liability for services that are not considered hospice care.

    Medicare payment to the hospice discharges an individual's liability 
for payment for all services, other than the hospice coinsurance amounts 
described in Sec. 418.400, that are considered covered hospice care (as 
described in Sec. 418.202). The individual is liable for the Medicare 
deductibles and coinsurance payments and for the difference between the 
reasonable and actual charge on unassigned claims on other covered 
services that are not considered hospice care. Examples of services not 
considered hospice care include: Services furnished before or after a 
hospice election period; services of the individual's attending 
physician, if the attending physician is not an employee of or working 
under an arrangement with the hospice; or Medicare services received for 
the treatment of an illness or injury not related to the individual's 
terminal condition.


<R05>
Sec. 418.405  Effect of coinsurance liability on Medicare payment.

    The Medicare payment rates established by HCFA in accordance with 
Sec. 418.306 are not reduced when the individual is liable for 
coinsurance payments. Instead, when establishing the payment rates, HCFA 
offsets the estimated cost of services by an estimate of average 
coinsurance amounts hospices collect.

<R05>
Sec. 420.202  Determination of ownership or control percentages.

    (a) Indirect ownership interest. The amount of indirect ownership 
interest is determined by multiplying the percentages of ownership in 
each entity. For example, if A owns 10 percent of the stock in a 
corporation that owns 80 percent of the disclosing entity, A's interest 
equates to an 8 percent indirect ownership interest in the disclosing 
entity and must be reported. Conversely, if B owns 80 percent of the 
stock of a corporation that owns 5 percent of the stock of the 
disclosing entity, B's interest equates to a 4 percent indirect 
ownership interest in the disclosing entity and need not be reported.
    (b) Person with an ownership or control interest. In order to 
determine the percentage of ownership interest in any mortgage, deed of 
trust, note, or other obligation, the percentage of interest owned in 
obligation is multiplied by the percentage of the disclosing entity's 
assets used to secure the obligation. For example, if A owns 10 percent 
of a note secured by 60 percent of the provider's assets, A's interest 
in the provider's assets equates to 6 percent and must be reported. 
Conversely, if B owns 40 percent of a note secured by 10 percent of the 
provider's assets, B's interest in the provider's assets equates to 4 
percent and need not be reported.


<R05>
Sec. 420.203  Disclosure of hiring of intermediary's former employees.

    A provider must notify the Secretary promptly if it, or its home 
office (in the case of a chain organization), employs or obtains the 
services of an individual who, at any time during the year preceding 
such employment, was employed in a managerial, accounting, auditing, or 
similar capacity by an agency or organization which currently serves, or 
at any time during the preceding year, served as a Medicare fiscal 
intermediary or carrier for the provider. Similar capacity means the 
performance of essentially the same work functions as those of a 
manager, accountant, or auditor even though the individual is not so 
designated by title.

supplier;
    (2) Is an agent or managing employee of the provider or part B 
supplier; or

interest in, or was a managing employee of a corporation that has been 
convicted of a criminal offense, subjected to any civil monetary 
penalty, or excluded from the programs for any activities related to 
involvement in the Medicare, Medicaid, title V or title XX social 
services program, since the inception of those programs.
    (b) Refusal to enter into or renew agreement or to issue or reissue 
billing numbers. HCFA may refuse to enter into or renew an agreement 
with a provider of services, or to issue or reissue a billing number to 
a part B supplier, if any person who has an ownership or control 
interest in the provider or supplier, or who is an agent or managing 
employee, has been convicted of a criminal offense or subjected to any 
civil penalty or sanction related to the involvement of that person in 
Medicare, Medicaid, title V or title XX social services programs. In 
making this decision, HCFA considers the facts and circumstances of the 
specific case, including the nature and severity of the crime, penalty 
or sanction and the extent to which it adversely affected beneficiaries 
and the programs involved. HCFA also considers whether it has been given 
reasonable assurance that the person will not commit any further 
criminal or civil offense against the programs.
    (c) Notification of Inspector General. HCFA promptly notifies the 
Inspector General of the Department of the receipt of any application or 
request for participation, certification, re-certification, or for a 
billing number that identifies any person described in paragraph (a)(3) 
of this section and the action taken on that application or request.

Sec. 420.205  Disclosure by providers and part B suppliers of business transaction information.

    A provider or part B supplier must submit to HCFA, within 35 days 
after the date of a written request, full and complete information on--
    (a) The ownership of a subcontractor with which the provider or part 
B supplier has had, during the previous 12 months, business transactions 
in an aggregate amount in excess of $25,000;
    (b) Any significant business transactions between the provider or 
part B supplier and any wholly owned supplier or between the provider or 
part B supplier and any subcontractor, during the 5 year period ending

    (c) The names of managing employees of the subcontractors;
    (d) The identity of any other entities to which payment may be made 
by Medicare, which a person with an ownership or control interest or a

control interest in the 3-year period preceding disclosure; and
    (e) Any penalties, assessments, or exclusions under sections 1128, 
1128A and 1128B of the Act incurred by the subcontractor, its owners, 
managing employees or those with a controlling interest in the 
subcontract.

<R05>
Sec. 420.206  Disclosure of persons having ownership, financial, or control interest.

    (a) Information that must be disclosed. A disclosing entity must 
submit the following information in the manner specified in paragraph 
(b) of this section:
    (1) The name and address of each person with an ownership or control 
interest in the entity or in any subcontractor in which the entity has 
direct or indirect ownership interest totaling 5 percent or more. In the 
case of a part B supplier that is a joint venture, ownership of 5 
percent or more of any company participating in the joint venture

[[Page 625]]

should be reported. Any physician who has been issued a Unique Physician 
Identification Number by the Medicare program must provide this number.
    (2) Whether any of the persons named, in compliance with paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, is related to another as spouse, parent, child, 
or sibling.
    (3) The name of any other disclosing entity in which any person with 
an ownership or control interest, or who is a managing employee in the 
reporting disclosing entity, has, or has had in the previous three-year 
period, an ownership or control interest or position as managing 
employee, and the nature of the relationship with the other disclosing 
entity. If any of these other disclosing entities has been convicted of 
a criminal offense or received a civil monetary or other administrative 
sanction related to participation in Medicare, Medicaid, title V 
(Maternal and Child Health) or title XX (Social Services) programs, such 
as penalties assessments and exclusions under sections 1128, 1128A or 
1128B of the Act, the disclosing entity must also provide that 
information.
    (b) Time and manner of disclosure. (1) Any disclosing entity that is 
subject to periodic survey and certification of its compliance with 
Medicare standards must supply the information specified in paragraph 
(a) of this section to the State survey agency at the time it is 
surveyed. The survey agency will promptly furnish the information to the 
Secretary.
    (2) Any disclosing entity that is not subject to periodic survey and 
certification must supply the information specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section to HCFA before entering into a contract or agreement with 
Medicare or before being issued or reissued a billing number as a part B 
supplier.
    (3) A disclosing entity must furnish updated information to HCFA at 
intervals between recertification, or re-enrollment, or contract 
renewals, within 35 days of a written request. In the case of a part B 
supplier, the supplier must report also within 35 days, on its own 
initiative, any changes in the information it previously supplied.
    (c) Consequences of failure to disclose. (1) HCFA does not approve 
an agreement or contract with, or make a determination of eligibility 
for, or (in the case of a part B supplier) issue or reissue a billing 
number to, any disclosing entity that fails to comply with paragraph (b) 
of this section.
    (2) HCFA terminates any existing agreement or contract with, or 
withdraws a determination of eligibility for or (in the case of a part B 
supplier) revokes the billing number of, any disclosing entity that 
fails to comply with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) Public disclosure. Information furnished to the Secretary under 
the provisions of this section shall be subject to public disclosure as 
specified in 20 CFR part 422.

  Subpart D--Access to Books, Documents, and Records of Subcontractors

    Source:  47 FR 58267, Dec. 30, 1982, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 420.300  Basis, purpose, and scope.

    This subpart implements section 1861(v)(1)(I) of the Act, which 
requires, for Medicare payment under certain provider contracts, access 
by the Secretary, upon written request, and the Comptroller General, and 
their duly authorized representatives, to certain contracts for services 
and to books, documents, and records necessary to verify the costs of 
the services. The contracts affected are those between providers and 
their subcontractors, and between the subcontractors and organizations 
related to the subcontractor by control or common ownership. It also 
specifies the criteria by which HHS will determine whether to request 
access to books, documents, and records.


<R05>
Sec. 420.301  Definitions.

    For purposes of this subpart--
    Books, documents, and records means all writings, recordings, 
transcriptions and tapes of any description necessary to verify the 
nature and extent of the costs of the services provided by the 
subcontractor.

[[Page 626]]

    Common ownership means that an individual or individuals possess 
significant ownership or equity in the subcontractor and the entity 
providing the services under the contract.
    Contract for services means a contract through which a provider 
obtains the performance of an act or acts, as distinguished from 
supplies or equipment. It includes any contract for both goods and 
services to the extent the value or cost of the service component is 
$10,000 or more within a 12-month period.
    Control means that an individual or an organization has the power, 
directly or indirectly, significantly to influence or direct the actions 
of policies of an organization.
    Provider means a hospital, skilled nursing facility, home health 
agency, hospice or comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility, or 
a related organization (as defined in Sec. 413.17 of this chapter) of 
any of these providers.
    Related to the subcontractor means that the subcontractor is, to a 
significant extent, associated or affiliated with, owns, or is owned by, 
or has control of or is controlled by, the organization furnishing the 
services, facilities, or supplies.
    Subcontractor means any entity, including an individual or 
individuals, that contracts with a provider to supply a service, either 
to the provider or directly to a beneficiary, for which Medicare 
reimburses the provider the cost of the service. This includes 
organizations related to the subcontractor that have a contract with the 
subcontractor for which the cost or value is $10,000 or more in a 12-
month period.

[47 FR 58267, Dec. 30, 1982, as amended at 49 FR 13703, Apr. 6, 1984; 51 
FR 34833, Sept. 30, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 420.302  Requirement for access clause in contracts.

    (a) Applicability. This subpart applies to contracts--
    (1) Between a provider and a subcontractor and, where subject to 
section 1861(v)(l)(I)(ii) of the Act, between a subcontractor and an 
organization related to the subcontractor;
    (2) Entered into or renewed after December 5, 1980; and
    (3) For services the cost or value of which is $10,000 or more over 
a 12-month period, including contracts for both goods and services in 
which the service component is worth $10,000 or more over a 12-month 
period.
    (b) Requirement. Any contract meeting the conditions of paragraph 
(a) of this section must include a clause that allows the Comptroller 
General of the United States, HHS, and their duly authorized 
representatives access to the subcontractor's contract, books, 
documents, and records until the expiration of four years after the 
services are furnished under the contract or subcontract. The access 
must be provided for in accordance with the provisions of this subpart. 
The clause must also allow similar access by HHS, the Comptroller 
General, and their duly authorized representatives to contracts subject 
to section 1861(v)(l)(I)(ii) of the Act between a subcontractor and 
organizations related to the subcontractor and to books, documents, and 
records.
    (c) Prohibition against Medicare reimbursement. If a contract 
subject to the requirements of this subpart does not contain the clause 
required by paragraph (b) of this section, HCFA will not reimburse the 
provider for the cost of the services furnished under the contract and 
will recoup any payments previously made for services under the 
contract. However, in order to avoid nonreimbursement or recoupment, 
providers will have until July 30, 1983, to amend those contracts 
entered into or renewed after December 5, 1980, and before January 31, 
1983, that do not conform to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this 
section.

[47 FR 58267, Dec. 30, 1982, as amended at 49 FR 13703, Apr. 6, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 420.303  HHS criteria for requesting books, documents, and records.

    HHS will generally request books, documents, and records from a 
subcontractor only if one of the following situations exists and the 
question cannot satisfactorily and efficiently be resolved without 
access to the books, documents, and records:
    (a) HHS has reason to believe that the costs claimed for services of 
the subcontractor are excessive or inappropriate.

[[Page 627]]

    (b) There is insufficient information to judge the appropriateness 
of the costs.
    (c) There is a written accusation with suitable evidence against the 
provider or subcontractor of kickbacks, bribes, rebates, or other 
illegal activities.
    (d) There is evidence of a possible nondisclosure of the existence 
of a related organization.


<R05>
Sec. 420.304  Procedures for obtaining access to books, documents, and records.

    (a) Contents of the request. Requests for access will be in writing 
and contain the following elements:
    (1) Reasonable identification of the books, documents, and records 
to which access is being requested.
    (2) Identification of the contract or subcontract in which costs are 
being questioned as excessive or inappropriate.
    (3) The reason that the appropriateness of the costs or value of the 
services of the subcontractor in question cannot be adequately or 
efficiently determined without access to the subcontractor's books and 
records.
    (4) The authority in the statute and regulations for the access 
requested.
    (5) To the extent possible, the identification of those individuals 
who will be visiting the subcontractor to obtain access to the books, 
documents, and records.
    (6) The time and date of the scheduled visit.
    (7) The name of the duly authorized representative of HHS to contact 
if there are any questions.
    (b) Subcontractor response to a request for access to books, 
documents, and records. (1) The subcontractor will have 30 days from the 
date of a written request for access to books, documents, and records to 
make them available in accordance with the request.
    (2) If the subcontractor believes the request is inadequate because 
it does not fully meet one or more of the required elements in paragraph 
(a) of this section, the subcontractor must advise the requesting 
organization of the additional information needed.
    (i) The subcontractor must notify the requesting organization within 
20 days of the date of the request that it was improperly completed.
    (ii) The subcontractor must make the books, documents, and records 
available within 20 days after the date of the requesting organization's 
response.
    (3) If the subcontractor believes, for good cause, that the 
requested books, documents, and records cannot be made available as 
requested with the 30-day period under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, 
the subcontractor may request an extension of time within which to 
comply with the request from the requesting organization. The requesting 
organization may, at its discretion, grant the request for an extension, 
in whole or in part, for good cause shown.
    (4) The subcontractor must make the books, documents, and records 
available during its regular business hours for inspection, audit, and 
reproduction.
    (5) If HHS asks the subcontractor to reproduce books, documents, and 
records, HHS will pay the reasonable cost of reproduction. However, if 
the subcontractor reproduces books, documents, and records as a means of 
making them available, the subcontractor must bear the cost of the 
reproduction and no Medicare reimbursement will be made for that 
purpose.
    (6) HHS reserves the right to examine the originals of any requested 
contracts, books, documents, and records, if they exist.
    (c) Refusal by subcontractor to furnish access to records. If HCFA 
determines that the books, documents, and records are necessary for the 
reimbursement determination and the subcontractor refuses to make them 
available, HHS may initiate legal action against the subcontractor.

<R04>
          Subpart A--Scope, Definitions, and General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 421.1  Basis and scope.

    (a) This part is based on the indicated provisions of the following 
sections of the Act:

    1124--Requirements for disclosure of certain information.
    1816 and 1842--Use of organizations and agencies in making Medicare 
payments to providers and suppliers of services.

    (b) Section 421.118 is also based on 42 U.S.C.1395b-1(a)(1)(F), 
which authorizes demonstration projects involving intermediary 
agreements and carrier contracts.
    (c) The provisions of this part apply to agreements with Part A 
(Hospital Insurance) intermediaries and contracts with Part B 
(Supplementary Medical Insurance) carriers. They also state that HCFA 
may perform certain functions directly or by contract. They specify 
criteria and standards to be used in selecting intermediaries and 
evaluating their performance, in assigning or reassigning a provider or 
providers to particular intermediaries, and in designating regional or 
national intermediaries for certain classes of providers. The provisions 
set forth the instances where there is the opportunity for a hearing for 
intermediaries and carriers affected by certain adverse actions. In some 
circumstances, the adversely affected intermediaries may request a 
judicial review of hearings decisions on--
    (1) Assignment or reassignment of a provider or providers; or
    (2) Designation of an intermediary or intermediaries to serve a 
class of providers.

<R05>
Sec. 421.3  Definitions.

    Intermediary means an entity that has a contract with HCFA to 
determine and make Medicare payments for Part A or Part B benefits 
payable on a cost basis (or under the Prospective Payment System for 
hospitals) and to perform other related functions. For purposes of 
designating regional or alternative regional intermediaries for home 
health agencies and of designating intermediaries for hospices under 
Sec. 421.117 as well as for applying the performance criteria in 
Sec. 421.120 and the performance standards in Sec. 421.122 and any 
adverse action resulting from such application, the term intermediary 
also means a Blue Cross Plan which has entered into a subcontract 
approved by HCFA with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association to 
perform intermediary functions.

[59 FR 681, Jan. 6, 1994]

[[Page 629]]


<R05>
Sec. 421.5  General provisions.

    (a) Competitive bidding not required for carriers. HCFA may enter 
into contracts with carriers, or with intermediaries to act as carriers 
in certain circumstances, without regard to section 3709 of the U.S. 
Revised Statutes or any other provision of law that requires competitive 
bidding.
    (b) Indemnification of intermediaries and carriers. Intermediaries 
and carriers act on behalf of HCFA in carrying out certain 
administrative responsibilities that the law imposes. Accordingly, their 
agreements and contracts contain clauses providing for indemnification 
with respect to actions taken on behalf of HCFA and HCFA is the real 
party of interest in any litigation involving the administration of the 
program.
    (c) Use of intermediaries to perform carrier functions. HCFA may 
contract with an intermediary to perform carrier functions with respect 
to services for which Part B payment is made to a provider.
    (d) Nonrenewal of agreement or contract. Notwithstanding any of the 
provisions of this part, HCFA has the authority not to renew an 
agreement or contract when its term expires.
    (e) Intermediary availability in an area. For more effective and 
efficient administration of the program, HCFA retains the right to 
expand or diminish the geographical area in which an intermediary is 
available to serve providers.
    (f) Provision for automatic renewal. Agreements and contracts under 
this part may contain automatic renewal clauses for continuation from 
term to term unless either party gives notice, within timeframes 
specified in the agreement or contract, of its intention not to renew.

<R04>
                        Subpart B--Intermediaries


<R05>
Sec. 421.100  Intermediary functions.

    An agreement between HCFA and an intermediary specifies the 
functions to be performed by the intermediary, which must include, but 
are not necessarily limited to, the following:
    (a) Coverage. (1) The intermediary ensures that it makes payments 
only for services that are:
    (i) Furnished to Medicare beneficiaries;
    (ii) Covered under Medicare; and
    (iii) In accordance with PRO determinations when they are services 
for which the PRO has assumed review responsibility under its contract 
with HCFA.
    (2) The intermediary takes appropriate action to reject or adjust 
the claim if--
    (i) The intermediary or the PRO determines that the services 
furnished or proposed to be furnished were not reasonable, not medically 
necessary, or not furnished in the most appropriate setting; or
    (ii) The intermediary determines that the claim does not properly 
reflect the kind and amount of services furnished.
    (b) Fiscal management. The intermediary must receive, disburse, and 
account for funds in making Medicare payments.
    (c) Provider audits. The intermediary must audit the records of 
providers of services as necessary to assure proper payments.
    (d) Utilization patterns. The intermediary must assist providers 
to--
    (1) Develop procedures relating to utilization practices;
    (2) Make studies of the effectiveness of those procedures and 
recommend methods to improve them;
    (3) Evaluate the results of utilization review activity; and
    (4) Assist in the application of safeguards against unnecessary 
utilization of services.
    (e) Resolution of cost report disputes. The intermediary must 
establish and maintain procedures approved by HCFA to consider and 
resolve any disputes that may result from provider dissatisfaction with 
an intermediary's determinations concerning provider cost reports.
    (f) Reconsideration of determinations. The intermediary must 
establish and maintain procedures approved by HCFA for the 
reconsideration of its determinations to deny payments to an

[[Page 630]]

individual or to the provider that furnished services to the individual. 
The PRO performs reconsideration of cases in which it made a 
determination subject to reconsideration.
    (g) Information and reports. The intermediary must furnish to HCFA 
any information and reports that HCFA requests in order to carry out its 
responsibilities in the administration of the Medicare program.
    (h) Other terms and conditions. The intermediary must comply with 
all applicable laws and regulations and with any other terms and 
conditions included in its agreement.
    (i) Dual intermediary responsibilities. With respect to the 
responsibility for service to provider-based HHAs and provider-based 
hospices, where the HHA or hospice and its parent provider will be 
served by different intermediaries under Sec. 421.117 of this part, the 
designated regional intermediary will process bills, make coverage 
determinations and make payments to the HHAs and hospices. The 
intermediary serving the parent provider will perform all fiscal 
functions, including audits and settlement of the Medicare cost reports 
and the HHA and hospice supplement worksheets.

<R05>
Sec. 421.103  Options available to providers and HCFA.

    (a) Except for hospices (which are covered under Sec. 421.117), a 
provider may elect to receive payment for covered services furnished to 
Medicare beneficiaries--
    (1) Directly from HCFA (subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) 
of this section); or
    (2) Through an intermediary, when both HCFA and the intermediary 
consent.
    (b) Whenever HCFA determines it appropriate, it may contract with 
any organization (including an intermediary with which HCFA has 
previously entered into an agreement under Sec. 421.105 and Sec. 421.110 
or designated as a regional or alternative regional intermediary under 
Sec. 421.117) for the purposes of making payments to any provider that 
does not elect to receive payment from an intermediary.

    (a) Nomination by groups or associations of providers. (1) An 
association of providers, except for hospices, may nominate an 
organization or agency to serve as intermediary for its members.
    (2) The nomination is not binding on any member of the association 
if it notifies HCFA of its nonconcurrence with the nomination.
    (3) The nomination must be made in writing, to HCFA, and must--
    (i) Identify the proposed intermediary by giving the complete name 
and address;
    (ii) Include, or furnish as an attachment, the name, address, and

    (iii) List the members that have concurred in the nomination of the 
proposed intermediary; and
    (iv) Be signed by an authorized representative of the association.
    (b) Action by nonmembers or nonconcurring members. Providers that 
nonconcur in their association's nomination, or are not members of an 
association, may--
    (1) Form a group of 2 or more providers for the specific purpose of 
nominating an intermediary, in accordance with provisions of paragraph 
(a) of this section;
    (2) Elect to receive payments from a fiscal intermediary with which 
HCFA already has an agreement, if HCFA and the intermediary agree to it 
(see Sec. 421.106); or
    (3) Elect to receive payment from HCFA as provided in Sec. 421.103.
    (c) HCFA is not required to enter into an agreement with a proposed

<R05>
Sec. 421.106  Change to another intermediary or to direct payment.

    (a) Any provider may request a change of intermediary, or except for 
a hospice, that it be paid directly by HCFA, by--
    (1) Giving HCFA written notice of its desire at least 120 days 
before the end of its current fiscal year; and
    (2) Concurrently giving written notice to its intermediary.
    (b) If HCFA finds the change is consistent with effective and 
efficient administration of the program and approves the request under 
paragraph (a) of this section, it will notify the provider, the outgoing 
intermediary, and the newly-elected intermediary (if any) that the 
change will be effective on the first day following the close of the 
fiscal year in which the request was filed.

<R05>
Sec. 421.110  Requirements for approval of an agreement.

    Before entering into or renewing an intermediary agreement, HCFA 
will--
    (a) Determine that to do so is consistent with the effective and 
efficient administration of the Medicare program;
    (b) Review the performance of the intermediary as measured by the 
criteria (Sec. 421.120) and standards (Sec. 421.122); and
    (c) Determine that the intermediary or prospective intermediary--
    (1) Is willing and able to assist providers in the application of 
safeguards against unnecessary utilization of services;
    (2) Meets all solvency and financial responsibility requirements 
imposed by the statutes and regulatory authorities of the State or 
States in which it, or any subcontractor performing some or all of its 
functions, would serve;
    (3) Has the overall resources and experience to administer its 
responsibilities under the Medicare program and has an existing 
operational, statistical, and recordkeeping capacity to carry out the 
additional program responsibilities it proposes to assume. HCFA will 
presume that an intermediary or prospective intermediary meets this 
requirement if it has at least 5 years experience in paying for or 
reimbursing the cost of health services;
    (4) Will serve a sufficient number of providers to permit a finding 
of effective and efficient administration. Under this criterion no 
intermediary or prospective intermediary shall be found to be not 
efficient or effective solely on the grounds that it serves only 
providers located in a single State;
    (5) Has acted in good faith to achieve effective cooperation with 
the providers it will service and with the physicians and medical 
societies in the area;
    (6) Has established a record of integrity and satisfactory service 
to the public; and
    (7) Has an affirmative equal employment opportunity program that 
complies with the fair employment provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 
1964 and Executive Order 11246, as amended.


<R05>
Sec. 421.112  Considerations relating to the effective and efficient administration of the program.

    (a) In order to accomplish the most effective and efficient 
administration of the Medicare program, determinations may be made by 
the Secretary with respect to the termination of an intermediary 
agreement, or by HCFA with respect to the--
    (1) Renewal of an intermediary agreement (Sec. 421.110);
    (2) Assignment or reassignment of providers to an intermediary 
(Sec. 421.114); or

[[Page 632]]

    (3) Designation of a regional or national intermediary to serve a 
class of providers (Sec. 421.116).
    (b) When taking the actions listed in paragraph (a), the Secretary 
or HCFA will consider the performance of the individual intermediary in 
its Medicare operations using the factors contained in the performance 
criteria (Sec. 421.120) and performance standards (Sec. 421.122).
    (c) In addition, when taking the actions listed in paragraph (a) of 
this section, the Secretary or HCFA may consider factors relating to--
    (1) Consistency in the administration of program policy;
    (2) Development of intermediary expertise in difficult areas of 
program administration;
    (3) Individual capacity of available intermediaries to serve 
providers as it is affected by such considerations as--
    (i) Program emphasis on the number or type of providers to be 
served; or
    (ii) Changes in data processing technology;
    (4) Overdependence of the program on the capacity of an intermediary 
to an extent that services could be interrupted;
    (5) Economy in the delivery of intermediary services;
    (6) Timeliness in the delivery of intermediary services;
    (7) Duplication in the availability of intermediaries;
    (8) Conflict of interest between an intermediary and provider; and
    (9) Any additional pertinent factors.

Sec. 421.114  Assignment and reassignment of providers by HCFA.

    HCFA may assign or reassign any provider to any intermediary if it 
determines that the assignment or reassignment will result in a more 
effective and efficient administration of the Medicare program. Before 
making this determination HCFA will consider--
    (a) The preferences of the provider;
    (b) The availability of an intermediary as specified in 
Sec. 421.5(e); and
    (c) Intermediary performance measured against the criteria and 
standards specified in Secs. 421.120 and 421.122.

[45 FR 42179, June 23, 1980, as amended at 49 FR 3660, Jan. 30, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 421.116  Designation of national or regional intermediaries.

    (a) After considering intermediary performance measured against the 
criteria and standards specified in Secs. 421.120 and 421.122, HCFA may 
designate a particular intermediary to serve a class of providers 
nationwide or in any geographic area it defines. HCFA may make this 
designation if it determines that the designation will result in a 
greater degree of effectiveness and efficiency in the administration of 
the Medicare program than could be achieved by an assignment of 
providers to an intermediary preferred by the providers.
    (b) No designation may be made until the affected providers and 
intermediaries are given an explanation and the intermediaries are 
advised of their right to a hearing and judicial review as specified in 
Sec. 421.128. This provision does not apply to experimental contracts 
awarded under Sec. 421.118.
    (c) To designate an intermediary, HCFA may establish classes of 
providers on the basis of--
    (1) The type of provider, for example, hospital, skilled nursing 
facility, home health agency; or
    (2) Common characteristics.

[45 FR 42179, June 23, 1980, as amended at 49 FR 3660, Jan. 30, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 421.117  Designation of regional and alternative designated regional intermediaries for home health agencies and hospices.

    (a) This section is based on section 1816(e)(4) of the Social 
Security Act, which requires the Secretary to designate regional 
intermediaries for home health agencies (HHAs) other than hospital-based 
HHAs but permits him or her to designate regional intermediaries for 
hospital-based HHAs only if the designation meets promulgated criteria 
concerning administrative efficiency and effectiveness; on section 
1816(e)(5) of the Social Security Act, which requires the Secretary to

[[Page 633]]

designate intermediaries for hospices; and on section 1874 of the Act, 
which permits HCFA to contract with any organization for the purpose of 
making payments to any provider that elects to receive payment directly 
from HCFA.
    (b) HCFA applies the following criteria to determine whether the 
assignment of hospital-based HHAs to designated regional intermediaries 
will result in the more effective and efficient administration of the 
Medicare program:
    (1) Uniform interpretation of Medicare rules;
    (2) Expertise in bill processing;
    (3) Control of administrative costs;
    (4) Ease of communication of program policy and issues to affected 
providers;
    (5) Ease of data collection;
    (6) Ease of HCFA's monitoring of intermediary performance; and
    (7) Other criteria as the Secretary believes to be pertinent.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this 
section, an HHA must receive payment through a regional intermediary 
designated by HCFA.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraphs (f) through (h) of this 
section, a hospice must receive payment for covered services furnished 
to Medicare beneficiaries through an intermediary designated by HCFA.
    (e) An HHA chain not desiring to receive payment from designated 
regional intermediaries may request service by one lead intermediary 
with the assistance of a local designated regional intermediary. 
Alternatively, the chain may request to be serviced by a single 
intermediary. A lead, local, or a single intermediary must be an 
organization that is a designated regional intermediary. Any request 
made under this paragraph is evaluated by HCFA in accordance with the 
criteria contained at Sec. 421.106 of this subpart.
    (f) An HHA or hospice not wishing to receive payment from a regional 
intermediary designated under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section may 
submit a request to the HCFA Regional Office to receive payment through 
an alternative regional intermediary designated by HCFA.
    (g) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, any request 
that an HHA or hospice may make to change from a designated regional 
intermediary to an alternative designated regional intermediary, in 
accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, is evaluated by HCFA in 
accordance with the criteria set forth at Sec. 421.106(b) of this 
subpart and must be filed within the timeframe established at 
Sec. 421.106(a) of this subpart.
    (h) Exception: An HHA or a hospice that, as of June 20, 1988 is 
receiving payment from a designated regional intermediary may, without 
regard to the limitations contained in Sec. 421.106 of this subpart, 
continue to receive payment from that intermediary. It may do so even if 
that intermediary is not the designated regional intermediary or the 
alternative designated regional intermediary for the particular State in 
which the HHA or hospice is located.

Sec. 421.118  Awarding of experimental contracts.

    Notwithstanding the provisions of Secs. 421.103 and 421.104, HCFA 
may award a fixed price or performance incentive contract under the 
experimental authority contained in 42 U.S.C. 1395b-1 for performance of 
any of the functions specified in Sec. 421.100. Action taken by HCFA 
under this paragraph is not subject to--
    (a) The administrative and judicial review which would otherwise be 
available under Sec. 421.128; or
    (b) Performance criteria and performance standards review as 
provided for in Secs. 421.120 and 421.122.

<R05>
Sec. 421.120  Performance criteria.

    (a) Application of performance criteria. As part of the intermediary 
evaluations authorized by section 1816(f) of the Act, HCFA periodically 
assesses the performance of intermediaries in their Medicare operations 
using performance criteria. The criteria measure and evaluate 
intermediary performance of functional responsibilities such as--

[[Page 634]]

    (1) Correct coverage and payment determinations;
    (2) Responsiveness to beneficiary concerns; and
    (3) Proper management of administrative funds.
    (b) Basis for criteria. HCFA will base the performance criteria on--
    (1) Nationwide intermediary experience;
    (2) Changes in intermediary operations due to fiscal constraints; 
and
    (3) HFCA's objectives in achieving better performance.
    (c) Publication of criteria. The development and revision of 
criteria for evaluating intermediary performance is a continuing 
process. Therefore, before the beginning of each evaluation period, HCFA 
will publish the performance criteria as a notice in the Federal 
Register.

[48 FR 7178, Feb. 18, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 421.122  Performance standards.

    (a) Development of standards. In addition to the performance 
criteria (Sec. 421.120), HCFA develops detailed performance standards 
for use in evaluating intermediary performance which may be based on 
historical performance, application of acceptable statistical measures 
of variation to nationwide intermediary experience during a base period, 
or changing program emphases or requirements. These standards are also 
developed considering intermediary experience and evaluate the specific 
requirements of each functional responsibility or criterion.
    (b) Factors beyond intermediary's control. To identify measurable 
factors that significantly affect an intermediary's performance, but 
that are not within the intermediary's control, HCFA will--
    (1) Study the performance of intermediaries during the base period, 
and
    (2) Consider the noncontrollable factors in developing performance 
standards.
    (c) Publication of standards. The development and revision of 
standards for evaluating intermediary performance is a continuing 
process. Therefore, before the beginning of each evaluation period, 
which usually coincides with the Federal fiscal year period of October 
1-September 30, HCFA publishes the performance standards as part of the 
Federal Register notice describing the performance criteria issued under 
Sec. 421.120(c). HCFA may not necessarily publish the criteria and 
standards every year. HCFA interprets the statutory phrase ``before the 
beginning of each evaluation period'' as allowing publication of the 
criteria and standards after the Federal fiscal year begins, as long as 
the evaluation period of the intermediaries for the new criteria and 
standards begins after the publication of the notice.

[59 FR 682, Jan. 6, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 421.124  Intermediary's failure to perform efficiently and effectively.

    (a) Failure by an intermediary to meet, or to demonstrate the 
capacity to meet, the criteria or standards specified in Secs. 421.120 
and 421.122 may be grounds for adverse action by the Secretary or by 
HCFA, such as reassignment of providers, offer of a short-term 
agreement, termination of a contract, or non-renewal of a contract. If 
an intermediary meets all criteria and standards in its overall 
performance, but does not meet them with respect to a specific provider 
or class of providers, HCFA may reassign that provider or class of 
providers to another intermediary in accordance with Sec. 421.114.
    (b) In addition, notwithstanding whether an intermediary meets the 
criteria and standards, if the cost incurred by the intermediary to meet 
its contractual requirements exceeds the amount which HCFA finds to be 
reasonable and adequate to meet the cost which must be incurred by an 
efficiently and economically operated intermediary, those high costs may 
also be grounds for adverse action.

<R05>
Sec. 421.126  Termination of agreements.

    (a) Termination by intermediary. An intermediary may terminate its 
agreement at any time by--
    (1) Giving written notice of its intention to HCFA and to the 
providers it services at least 180 days before its intended termination 
date; and

[[Page 635]]

    (2) Giving public notice of its intention by publishing a statement 
of the effective date of termination at least 60 days before that date. 
Publication must be in a newspaper of general circulation in each 
community served by the intermediary.
    (b) Termination by the Secretary, and right of appeal. (1) The 
Secretary may terminate an agreement if--
    (i) The intermediary fails to comply with the requirements of this 
subpart;
    (ii) The intermediary fails to meet the criteria or standards 
specified in Secs. 421.120 and 421.122; or
    (iii) HCFA has reassigned, under Sec. 421.114 or Sec. 421.116, all 
of the providers assigned to the intermediary.
    (2) If the Secretary decides to terminate an agreement, he or she 
will offer the intermediary an opportunity for a hearing, in accordance 
with Sec. 421.128.
    (3) If the intermediary does not request a hearing, or if the 
hearing decision affirms the Secretary's decision, the Secretary will 
provide reasonable notice of the effective date of termination to--
    (i) The intermediary;
    (ii) The providers served by the intermediary; and
    (iii) The general public.
    (4) The providers served by the intermediary will be given the 
opportunity to nominate another intermediary, in accordance with 
Sec. 421.104.


<R05>
Sec. 421.128  Intermediary's opportunity for hearing and right to judicial review.

    (a) Basis for appeal. An intermediary adversely affected by any of 
the following actions shall be granted an opportunity for a hearing:
    (1) Assignment or reassignment of providers to another intermediary.
    (2) Designation of a national or regional intermediary to serve a 
class of providers.
    (3) Termination of the agreement.
    (b) Request for hearing. The intermediary shall file the request 
with HCFA within 20 days from the date on the notice of intended action.
    (c) Hearing procedures. The hearing officer shall be a 
representative of the Secretary and not otherwise a party to the initial 
administrative decision. The intermediary may be represented by counsel 
and may present evidence and examine witnesses. A complete recording of 
the proceedings at the hearing will be made and transcribed.
    (d) Judicial review. An adverse hearing decision concerning action 
under paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section is subject to judicial 
review in accordance with 5 U.S.C. chapter 7.
    (e) As specified in Sec. 421.118, contracts awarded under the 
experimental authority of HCFA are not subject to the provisions of this 
section.
    (f) Exception. An intermediary adversely affected by the designation 
of a regional intermediary or an alternative regional intermediary for 
HHAs, or an intermediary for hospices, under Sec. 421.117 of this 
subpart is not entitled to a hearing or judicial review concerning 
adverse effects caused by the designation of an intermediary.

Sec. 421.201  Performance criteria and standards.

    (a) Application of performance criteria and standards. As part of 
the carrier evaluations mandated by section 1842(b)(2) of the Act, HCFA 
periodically assesses the performance of carriers in their Medicare 
operations using performance criteria and standards.
    (1) The criteria measure and evaluate carrier performance of 
functional responsibilities such as--
    (i) Accurate and timely payment determinations;
    (ii) Responsiveness to beneficiary, physician, and supplier 
concerns; and
    (iii) Proper management of administrative funds.
    (2) The standards evaluate the specific requirements of each 
functional responsibility or criterion.
    (b) Basis for criteria and standards. HCFA bases the performance 
criteria and standards on--
    (1) Nationwide carrier experience;
    (2) Changes in carrier operations due to fiscal constraints; and
    (3) HCFA's objectives in achieving better performance.

[[Page 637]]

    (c) Publication of criteria and standards. Before the beginning of 
each evaluation period, which usually coincides with the Federal fiscal 
year period of October 1-September 30, HCFA publishes the performance 
criteria and standards as a notice in the Federal Register. HCFA may not 
necessarily publish the criteria and standards every year. HCFA 
interprets the statutory phrase ``before the beginning of each 
evaluation period'' as allowing publication of the criteria and 
standards after the Federal fiscal year begins, as long as the 
evaluation period of the carriers for the new criteria and standards 
begins after the publication of the notice.

    (a) Has the capacity to perform its contractual responsibilities 
effectively and efficiently;
    (b) Has the financial responsibility and legal authority necessary 
to carry out its responsibilities; and
    (c) Will be able to meet any other requirements HCFA considers 
pertinent, and, if designated a regional DMEPOS carrier, any special 
requirements for regional carriers under Sec. 421.210 of this subpart.

    (a) Failure by a carrier to meet, or demonstrate the capacity to 
meet, the criteria and standards specified in Sec. 421.201 may be 
grounds for adverse action by the Secretary, such as contract 
termination or non-renewal.
    (b) Notwithstanding whether or not a carrier meets the criteria and 
standards specified in Sec. 421.201, if the cost incurred by the carrier 
to meet its contractual requirements exceeds the amount that HCFA finds 
to be reasonable and adequate to meet the cost which must be incurred by 
an efficiently and economically operated carrier, those high costs may 
also be grounds for adverse action.

Sec. 421.205  Termination by the Secretary.

    (a) Cause for termination. The Secretary may terminate a contract 
with a carrier at any time if he or she determines that the carrier has 
failed substantially to carry out any material terms of the contract or 
has performed its function in a manner inconsistent with the effective 
and efficient administration of the Medicare Part B program.
    (b) Notice and opportunity for hearing. Upon notification of the 
Secretary's intent to terminate the contract, the carrier may request a 
hearing within 20 days after the date on the notice of intent to 
terminate.
    (c) Hearing procedures. The hearing procedures will be those 
specified in Sec. 421.128(c).


<R05>
Sec. 421.210  Designations of regional carriers to process claims for durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics and supplies.

    (a) Basis. This section is based on sections 1834(a) and 1834(h) of 
the Act which authorize the Secretary to designate one or more carriers 
by specific regions to process claims for durable medical equipment, 
prosthetic devices, prosthetics, orthotics and other supplies (DMEPOS). 
This authority has been delegated to HCFA.
    (b) Types of claims. Claims for the following, except for items 
incident to a physician's professional service as defined in 
Sec. 410.26, incident to a physician's service in a rural health clinic 
as defined in Sec. 405.2413, or bundled into payment to a provider, 
ambulatory surgical center, or other facility, are processed by the 
designated carrier for its designated region and not by other carriers--
    (1) Durable medical equipment (and related supplies) as defined in 
section 1861(n) of the Act;
    (2) Prosthetic devices (and related supplies) as described in 
section

[[Page 638]]

1861(s)(8) of the Act, (including intraocular lenses and parenteral and 
enteral nutrients, supplies, and equipment, when furnished under the 
prosthetic device benefit);
    (3) Orthotics and prosthetics (and related supplies) as described in 
section 1861(s)(9);
    (4) Home dialysis supplies and equipment as described in section 
1861(s)(2)(F);
    (5) Surgical dressings and other devices as described in section 
1861(s)(5);
    (6) Immunosuppressive drugs as described in section 1861(s)(2)(J); 
and
    (7) Other items or services which are designated by HCFA.
    (c) Region designation. The boundaries of the four regions for 
processing claims described in paragraph (b) of this section coincide 
with the boundaries of 1 or more sectors or areas designated for the 
Common Working File. These four regions contain the following States and 
territories: Region A: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts,

Delaware. Region B: Maryland, the District of Columbia, Virginia, West 
Virginia, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wiconsin and Minnesota. 
Region C: North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, 
Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, New 
Mexico, Colorado, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Region D: Alaska, 
Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, California, 
Nevada, Arizona, Washington, Oregon, Montana, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, 
North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa and Missouri.
    (d) Criteria for designating regional carriers. HCFA designates 
regional carriers to achieve a greater degree of effectiveness and 
efficiency in the administration of the Medicare program as measured 
by--
    (1) Timeliness of claim processing;
    (2) Cost per claim;
    (3) Claim processing quality;
    (4) Experience in claim processing, and in establishing local 
medical review policy; and
    (5) Other criteria that HCFA believes to be pertinent.
    (e) Carrier designation. (1) Each carrier designated a regional 
carrier is responsible, using the payment rates applicable for the State 
of residence of a beneficiary, including a qualified Railroad Retirement 
beneficiary, for processing claims for items listed in paragraph (b) of 
this section for beneficiaries whose permanent residence is within the 
area designated in paragraph (c) of this section. A beneficiary's 
permanent residence is the address at which he or she intends to spend 6 
months or more of the calendar year.
    (2) The regional carriers designated to process DMEPOS claims (as 
defined in paragraph (b) of this section) for all Medicare beneficiaries 
residing in their respective regions (as designated in paragraph (c) of 
this section), including those entitled under the Railroad Retirement 
Act, are the following:
    (i) The Travelers Insurance Company (Region A), which will be 
processing claims in Pennsylvania.
    (ii) Associated Insurance Companies, Inc.--AdminaStar (Region B), 
which will be processing claims in Indiana.
    (iii) Blue Cross and Blue Shield of South Carolina (doing business 
as Palmetto Governments Benefits Administrators) (Region C), which will 
be processing claims in South Carolina.
    (iv) Connecticut General Life Insurance Co. (a CIGNA Company) 
(Region D), which will be processing claims in Tennessee.
    (3) Blue Cross and Blue Shield of South Carolina (Palmetto 
Government Benefits Administrators) has been selected to serve as the 
National Supplier Clearinghouse and the Statistical Analysis DME 
regional carrier.
    (4) The contracts for the four DME regional carriers will be 
periodically recompeted. The National Supplier Clearinghouse and 
Statistical Analysis DME regional carrier do not constitute separate 
contracts, but are contract amendments to one of the DME regional 
carrier contracts. The National Supplier Clearinghouse and Statistical 
Analysis DME regional carrier contract amendments will also be 
periodically recompeted.
    (f) Collecting information of ownership. Carriers designated as 
regional claims

[[Page 639]]

processors must obtain from each supplier of items listed in paragraph 
(b) of this section information concerning ownership and control as 
required by section 1124A of the Act and part 420 of this chapter, and 
certifications that supplier standards are met as required by part 424 
of this chapter.

Sec. 421.212  Railroad Retirement Board contracts.

    In accordance with this subpart C, the Railroad Retirement Board 
contracts with DMEPOS regional carriers designated by HCFA, as set forth 
in Sec. 421.210(e)(2), for processing claims for Medicare-eligible 
Railroad Retirement beneficiaries, for the same contract period as the 
contracts entered into between HCFA and the DMEPOS regional carriers.

<R05>
Sec. 421.214  Advance payments to suppliers furnishing items or services under Part B.

    (a) Scope and applicability. This section provides for the 
following:
    (1) Sets forth requirements and procedures for the issuance and 
recovery of advance payments to suppliers of Part B services and the 
rights and responsibilities of suppliers under the payment and recovery 
process.
    (2) Does not limit HCFA's right to recover unadjusted advance 
payment balances.
    (3) Does not affect suppliers' appeal rights under part 405, subpart 
H of this chapter relating to substantive determinations on suppliers' 
claims.
    (4) Does not apply to claims for Part B services furnished by 
suppliers that have in effect provider agreements under section 1866 of 
the Act and part 489 of this chapter, and are paid by intermediaries.
    (b) Definition. As used in this section, advance payment means a 
conditional partial payment made by the carrier in response to a claim 
that it is unable to process within established time limits.
    (c) When advance payments may be made. An advance payment may be 
made if all of the following conditions are met:
    (1) The carrier is unable to process the claim timely.
    (2) HCFA determines that the prompt payment interest provision 
specified in section 1842(c) of the Act is insufficient to make a 
claimant whole.
    (3) HCFA approves, in writing to the carrier, the making of an 
advance payment by the carrier.
    (d) When advance payments are not made. Advance payments are not 
made to any supplier that meets any of the following conditions:
    (1) Is delinquent in repaying a Medicare overpayment.
    (2) Has been advised of being under active medical review or program 
integrity investigation.
    (3) Has not submitted any claims.
    (4) Has not accepted claims' assignments within the most recent 180-
day period preceding the system malfunction.
    (e) Requirements for suppliers. (1) Except as provided for in 
paragraph (g)(1) of this section, a supplier must request, in writing to 
the carrier, an advance payment for Part B services it furnished.
    (2) A supplier must accept an advance payment as a conditional 
payment subject to adjustment, recoupment, or both, based on an eventual 
determination of the actual amount due on the claim and subject to the 
provisions of this section.
    (f) Requirements for carriers. (1) A carrier must notify a supplier 
as soon as it is determined that payment will not be made in a timely 
manner, and an advance payment option is to be offered to the supplier.
    (i) A carrier must calculate an advance payment for a particular 
claim at no more than 80 percent of the anticipated payment for that 
claim based upon the historical assigned claims payment data for claims 
paid the supplier.
    (ii) ``Historical data'' are defined as a representative 90-day 
assigned claims payment trend within the most recent 180-day experience 
before the system malfunction.
    (iii) Based on this amount and the number of claims pending for the 
supplier, the carrier must determine and issue advance payments.

[[Page 640]]

    (iv) If historical data are not available or if backlogged claims 
cannot be identified, the carrier must determine and issue advance 
payments based on some other methodology approved by HCFA.
    (v) Advance payments can be made no more frequently than once every 
2 weeks to a supplier.
    (2) Generally, a supplier will not receive advance payments for more 
assigned claims than were paid, on a daily average, for the 90-day 
period before the system malfunction.
    (3) A carrier must recover an advance payment by applying it against 
the amount due on the claim on which the advance was made. If the 
advance payment exceeds the Medicare payment amount, the carrier must 
apply the unadjusted balance of the advance payment against future 
Medicare payments due the supplier.
    (4) In accordance with HCFA instructions, a carrier must maintain a 
financial system of data in accordance with the Statement of Federal 
Financial Accounting Standards for tracking each advance payment and its 
recoupment.
    (g) Requirements for HCFA. (1) In accordance with the provisions of 
this section, HCFA may determine that circumstances warrant the issuance 
of advance payments to all affected suppliers furnishing Part B 
services. HCFA may waive the requirement in paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section as part of that determination.
    (2) If adjusting Medicare payments fails to recover an advance 
payment, HCFA may authorize the use of any other recoupment method 
available (for example, lump sum repayment or an extended repayment 
schedule) including, upon written notice from the carrier to the 
supplier, converting any unpaid balances of advance payments to 
overpayments. Overpayments are recovered in accordance with part 401, 
subpart F of this chapter concerning claims collection and compromise 
and part 405, subpart C of this chapter concerning recovery of 
overpayments.
    (h) Prompt payment interest. An advance payment is a ``payment'' 
under section 1842(c)(2)(C) of the Act for purposes of meeting the time 
limit for the payment of clean claims, to the extent of the advance 
payment.
    (i) Notice, review, and appeal rights. (1) The decision to advance 
payments and the determination of the amount of any advance payment are 
committed to HCFA's discretion and are not subject to review or appeal.
    (2) The carrier must notify the supplier receiving an advance 
payment about the amounts advanced and recouped and how any Medicare 
payment amounts have been adjusted.
    (3) The supplier may request an administrative review from the 
carrier if it believes the carrier's reconciliation of the amounts 
advanced and recouped is incorrectly computed. If a review is requested, 
the carrier must provide a written explanation of the adjustments.
    (4) The review and explanation described in paragraph (i)(3) of this 
section is separate from a supplier's right to appeal the amount and 
computation of benefits paid on the claim, as provided at part 405, 
subpart H of this chapter. The carrier's reconciliation of amounts 
advanced and recouped is not an initial determination as defined at 
Sec. 405.803 of this chapter, and any written explanation of a 
reconciliation is not subject to further administrative review.

<R05>
Sec. 424.7  General limitations.

    (a) Utilization review finding on medical necessity. When a PRO or a 
UR committee notifies a hospital or SNF of its finding that further 
services are not medically necessary, the following rules apply:
    (1) Hospitals subject to PPS. Payment may not be made for inpatient 
hospital services furnished by a PPS hospital after the second day after 
the day on which the hospital received the notice.

provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, payment may not be 
made for inpatient hospital services or posthospital SNF care furnished 
after the day on which the hospital or SNF received the notice.
    (ii) Exception. Payment may be made for 1 or 2 additional days if 
the PRO or UR committee approves them as necessary for planning for 
post-discharge care.
    (b) Failure to make timely utilization review. Payment may not be 
made for inpatient hospital services or posthospital SNF care furnished, 
after the 20th consecutive day of a stay, to an individual who is 
admitted to the hospital or SNF after HCFA has determined that the 
hospital or SNF has failed to make timely utilization review in long 
stay cases. (This provision does not apply to a hospital or SNF for 
which a PRO has assumed binding review.)

<R04>
       Subpart B--Certification and Plan of Treatment Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 424.10  Purpose and scope.

    (a) Purpose. The physician has a major role in determining 
utilization of health services furnished by providers. The physician 
decides upon admissions, orders tests, drugs, and treatments, and 
determines the length of stay. Accordingly, sections 1814(a)(2) and 
1835(a)(2) of the Act establish as a condition for Medicare payment that 
a physician certify the necessity of the services and, in some 
instances, recertify the continued need for those services.

Section 1814(a)(2) of the Act also permits nurse practitioners or 
clinical nurse specialists to certify and recertify the need for post-
hospital extended care services.
    (b) Scope. This subpart sets forth the timing, content, and 
signature requirements for certification and recertification with 
respect to certain Medicare services furnished by providers.

[60 FR 38271, July 26, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 424.11  General procedures.

    (a) Responsibility of the provider. The provider must--
    (1) Obtain the required certification and recertification 
statements;
    (2) Keep them on file for verification by the intermediary, if 
necessary; and
    (3) Certify, on the appropriate billing form, that the statements 
have been obtained and are on file.
    (b) Obtaining the certification and recertification statements. No 
specific procedures or forms are required for certification and 
recertification statements. The provider may adopt any method that 
permits verification. The certification and recertification statements 
may be entered on forms, notes, or records that the appropriate 
individual signs, or on a special separate form. Except as provided in 
paragraph (d) of this section for delayed certifications,

[[Page 644]]

there must be a separate signed statement for each certification or 
recertification.
    (c) Required information. The succeeding sections of this subpart 
set forth specific information required for different types of services. 
If that information is contained in other provider records, such as 
physicians' progress notes, it need not be repeated. It will suffice for 
the statement to indicate where the information is to be found.
    (d) Timeliness. (1) The succeeding sections of this subpart also 
specify the time frames for certifications and for initial and 
subsequent recertifications.
    (2) A hospital or SNF may provide for obtaining a certification or 
recertification earlier than required by these regulations, or vary the 
time frame (within the prescribed outer limits) for different diagnostic 
or clinical categories.
    (3) Delayed certification and recertification statements are 
acceptable when there is a legitimate reason for delay. (For instance, 
the patient was unaware of his or her entitlement when he or she was 
treated.) Delayed certification and recertification statements must 
include an explanation of the reason for the delay.
    (4) A delayed certification may be included with one or more 
recertifications on a single signed statement.
    (e) Limitation on authorization to sign statements. A certification 
or recertification statement may be signed only by one of the following:
    (1) A physician who is a doctor of medicine or osteopathy.
    (2) A dentist in the circumstances specified in Sec. 424.13(c).
    (3) A doctor of podiatric medicine if his or her certification is 
consistent with the functions he or she is authorized to perform under 
State law.
    (4) A nurse practitioner or clinical nurse specialist, as defined in 
paragraph (e)(5) or (e)(6) of this section, in the circumstances 
specified in Sec. 424.20(e).
    (5) For purposes of this section, to qualify as a nurse 
practitioner, an individual must--
    (i) Be a registered professional nurse who is currently licensed to 
practice nursing in the State where he or she practices; be authorized 
to perform the services of a nurse practitioner in accordance with State 
law; and have a master's degree in nursing;
    (ii) Be certified as a nurse practitioner by a professional 
association recognized by HCFA that has, at a minimum, eligibility 
requirements that meet the standards in paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this 
section; or
    (iii) Meet the requirements for a nurse practitioner set forth in 
paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section, except for the master's degree 
requirement, and have received before August 25, 1998 a certificate of 
completion from a formal advanced practice program that prepares 
registered nurses to perform an expanded role in the delivery of primary 
care.
    (6) For purposes of this section, to qualify as a clinical nurse 
specialist, an individual must--
    (i) Be a registered professional nurse who is currently licensed to 
practice nursing in the State where he or she practices; be authorized 
to perform the services of a clinical nurse specialist in accordance 
with State law; and have a master's degree in a defined clinical area of 
nursing;
    (ii) Be certified as a clinical nurse specialist by a professional 
association recognized by HCFA that has at a minimum, eligibility 
requirements that meet the standards in paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this 
section; or
    (iii) Meet the requirements for a clinical nurse specialist set 
forth in paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section, except for the master's 
degree requirement, and have received before August 25, 1998 a 
certificate of completion from a formal advanced practice program that 
prepares registered nurses to perform an expanded role in the delivery 
of primary care.

[[Page 645]]

    (i) Continued hospitalization of the patient for medical treatment 
or medically required inpatient diagnostic study; or
    (ii) Special or unusual services for cost outlier cases (under the 
prospective payment system set forth in subpart F of part 412 of this 
chapter).
    (2) The estimated time the patient will need to remain in the 
hospital.
    (3) The plans for posthospital care, if appropriate.
    (b) Certification of need for hospitalization when a SNF bed is not 
available. (1) A physician may certify or recertify need for continued 
hospitalization if the physician finds that the patient could receive 
proper treatment in a SNF but no bed is available in a participating 
SNF.
    (2) If this is the basis for the physician's certification or 
recertification, the required statement must so indicate; and the 
physician is expected to continue efforts to place the patient in a 
participating SNF as soon as a bed becomes available.
    (c) Signatures. (1) Basic rule. Except as specified in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section, certifications and recertifications must be 
signed by the physician responsible for the case, or by another 
physician who has knowledge of the case and who is authorized to do so 
by the responsible physician or by the hospital's medical staff.
    (2) Exception. If the intermediary requests certification of the 
need to admit a patient in connection with dental procedures, because 
his or her underlying medical condition and clinical status or the 
severity of the dental procedures require hospitalization, that 
certification may be signed by the dentist caring for the patient.
    (d) Timing of certifications and recertifications: Cases not subject 
to the prospective payment system (PPS). (1) For cases that are not 
subject to PPS, certification is required no later than as of the 12th 
day of hospitalization. A hospital may, at its option, provide for the 
certification to be made earlier, or it may vary the timing of the 
certification within the 12-day period by diagnostic or clinical 
categories.
    (2) The first recertification is required no later than as of the 
18th day of hospitalization.
    (3) Subsequent recertifications are required at intervals 
established by the UR committee (on a case-by-case basis if it so 
chooses), but no less frequently than every 30 days.
    (e) Timing of certification and recertification: Cases subject to 
PPS. For cases subject to PPS, certification is required as follows:
    (1) For day-outlier cases, certification is required no later than 
one day after the hospital reasonably assumes that the case meets the 
outlier criteria, established in accordance with Sec. 412.80(a)(1)(i) of 
this chapter, or no later than 20 days into the hospital stay, whichever 
is earlier. The first and subsequent recertifications are required at 
intervals established by the UR committee (on a case-by-case basis if it 
so chooses) but not less frequently than every 30 days.
    (2) For cost-outlier cases, certification is required no later than 
the date on which the hospital requests cost outlier payment or 20 days 
into the hospital stay, whichever is earlier. If possible, certification 
must be made before the hospital incurs costs for which it will seek 
cost outlier payment. In cost outlier cases, the first and subsequent 
recertifications are required at intervals established by the UR 
committee (on a case-by-case basis if it so chooses).
    (f) Recertification requirement fulfilled by utilization review. (1) 
At the hospital's option, extended stay review by its UR committee may 
take the place of the second and subsequent physician recertifications 
required for cases not subject to PPS and for PPS day-outlier cases.
    (2) A utilization review that is used to fulfill the recertification 
requirement is considered timely if performed no later than the seventh 
day after the day the physician recertification would have been 
required. The next physician recertification would need to be made no 
later than the 30th day following such review; if review by the UR 
committee took the place of this physician recertification, the review 
could be performed as late as the seventh day following the 30th day.
    (g) Description of procedures. The hospital must have available on 
file a written description that specifies the

[[Page 646]]

time schedule for certifications and recertifications, and indicates 
whether utilization review of long-stay cases fulfills the requirement 
for second and subsequent recertifications of all cases not subject to 
PPS and of PPS day outlier cases.

Sec. 424.14  Requirements for inpatient services of psychiatric hospitals.

    (a) Content of certification and recertification: General 
considerations. The content requirements differ from those for other 
hospitals because the care furnished in psychiatric hospitals is often 
purely custodial and thus not covered under Medicare. The purpose of the 
statements, therefore, is to help ensure that Medicare pays only for 
services of the type appropriate for Medicare coverage. Accordingly, 
Medicare Part A pays for inpatient care in a psychiatric hospital only 
if a physician certifies and recertifies the need for services 
consistent with the content of paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section, as 
appropriate.
    (b) Content of certification. Inpatient psychiatric services were 
required--
    (1) For treatment that could reasonably be expected to improve the 
patient's condition; or
    (2) For diagnostic study.
    (c) Content of recertification. (1) Inpatient services furnished 
since the previous certification or recertification were, and continue 
to be, required--
    (i) For treatment that could reasonably be expected to improve the 
patient's condition; or
    (ii) For diagnostic study; and
    (2) The hospital records show that the services furnished were--
    (i) Intensive treatment services;
    (ii) Admission and related services necessary for diagnostic study; 
or
    (iii) Equivalent services.
    (d) Timing of certification and recertification. (1) Certification 
is required at the time of admission or as soon thereafter as is 
reasonable and practicable.
    (2) The first recertification is required as of the 18th day of 
hospitalization. Subsequent recertifications are required at intervals 
established by the UR committee (on a case-by-case basis if it so 
chooses), but no less frequently than every 30 days.
    (e) Other requirements. Psychiatric hospitals must also meet the 
requirements set forth in Sec. 424.13 (b), (c), (f), and (g).


<R05>
Sec. 424.15  Requirements for inpatient CAH services.

    (a) Content of certification. Medicare Part A pays for inpatient CAH 
services only if a physician certifies that the individual may 
reasonably be expected to be discharged or transferred to a hospital 
within 96 hours after admission to the CAH.
    (b) Timing of certification. Certification is required no later than 
1 day before the date on which the claim for payment for the inpatient 
CAH services is submitted.

[58 FR 30671, May 26, 1993, as amended at 60 FR 45850, Sept. 1, 1995; 62 
FR 46035, 46037, Aug. 29, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 424.16  Timing of certification for individual admitted to a hospital before entitlement to Medicare benefits.

    (a) Basic rule. If an indivdual is admitted to a hospital before 
becoming entitled to Medicare benefits (for instance, before attaining 
age 65), the day of entitlement (instead of the day of admission) is the 
starting point for the time limits specified in Sec. 424.13(e) for 
certification and recertification.
    (b) Example. (Hospital that is not a psychiatric hospital and is not 
subject to PPS). For a patient who is admitted on August 15 and becomes 
entitled on September 1--
    (1) The certification is required no later than September 12;
    (2) The first recertification is required no later than September 
18; and
    (3) Subsequent recertifications are required at least every 30 days 
after September 18.

<R05>
Sec. 424.20  Requirements for posthospital SNF care.

    Medicare Part A pays for posthospital SNF care furnished by a SNF, 
or a hospital or CAH with a swing-bed approval, only if the 
certification and recertification for services are consistent with the 
content of

[[Page 647]]

paragraph (a) or (c) of this section, as appropriate.
    (a) Content of certification. (1) General requirements. (i) 
Posthospital SNF care is or was required because the individual needs or 
needed on a daily basis skilled nursing care (furnished directly by or 
requiring the supervision of skilled nursing personnel) or other skilled 
rehabilitation services that, as a practical matter, can only be 
provided in a SNF or a swing-bed hospital on an inpatient basis; and
    (ii) The SNF care is or was needed for a condition for which the 
individual received inpatient care in a participating hospital or a 
qualified hospital, as defined in Sec. 409.3 of this chapter.
    (2) Special requirement: A swing-bed hospital with more than 49 beds 
(but fewer than 100) that does not transfer a swing-bed patient to a SNF 
within 5 days of the availability date. Transfer of the extended care 
patient to the SNF is not medically appropriate.
    (b) Timing of certification. (1) General rule. The certification 
must be obtained at the time of admission or as soon thereafter as is 
reasonable and practicable.
    (2) Special rules for certain swing-bed hospitals. For swing-bed 
hospitals with more than 49 beds that are approved after March 31, 1988, 
the extended care patient's physician has 5 days (excluding weekends and 
holidays) beginning on the availability date as defined in 
Sec. 413.114(b), to certify that the transfer of the extended care 
patient is not medically appropriate.
    (c) Content of recertifications. (1) The reasons for the continued 
need for posthopsital SNF care:
    (2) The estimated time the individual will need to remain in the 
SNF;
    (3) Plans for home care, if any; and
    (4) If appropriate, the fact that continued services are needed for 
a condition that arose after admission to the SNF and while the 
individual was still under treatment for the condition for which he or 
she had received inpatient hospital services.
    (d) Timing of recertifications. (1) The first recertification is 
required no later than the 14th day of posthospital SNF care.
    (2) Subsequent recertifications are required at least every 30 days 
after the first recertification.
    (e) Signature. Certification and recertification statements may be 
signed by--
    (1) The physician responsible for the case or, with his or her 
authorization, by a physician on the SNF staff or a physician who is 
available in case of an emergency and has knowledge of the case; or
    (2) A nurse practitioner or clinical nurse specialist, neither of 
whom has a direct or indirect employment relationship with the facility 
but who is working in collaboration with a physician. For purposes of 
this section, collaboration means a process whereby a nurse practitioner 
or clinical nurse specialist works with a doctor of medicine or 
osteopathy to deliver health care services. The services are delivered 
within the scope of the nurse's professional expertise, with medical 
direction and appropriate supervision as provided for in guidelines 
jointly developed by the nurse and the physician or other mechanisms 
defined by Federal regulations and the law of the State in which the 
services are performed.
    (f) Recertification requirement fulfilled by utilization review. A 
SNF may substitute utilization review of extended stay cases for the 
second and subsequent recertifications, if it includes this procedure in 
its utilization review plan.
    (g) Description of procedures. The SNF must have available on file a 
written description that specifies the certification and recertification 
time schedule and indicates whether utilization review is used as an 
alternative to the second and subsequent recertifications.

FR 30671, May 26, 1993; 60 FR 38272, July 26, 1995; 62 FR 46037, Aug.

<R05>
Sec. 424.22  Requirements for home health services.

    Medicare Part A or Part B pays for home health services only if a 
physician certifies and recertifies the content specified in paragraphs 
(a)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, as appropriate.
    (a) Certification--(1) Content of certification. As a condition for 
payment of

[[Page 648]]

home health services under Medicare Part A or Medicare Part B, a 
physician must certify as follows:
    (i) The individual needs or needed intermittent skilled nursing 
care, or physical or speech therapy, or (for the period from July 
through November 30, 1981) occupational therapy.
    (ii) Home health services were required because the individual was 
confined to the home except when receiving outpatient services.
    (iii) A plan for furnishing the services has been established and is 
periodically reviewed by a physician who is a doctor of medicine, 
osteopathy, or podiatric medicine, and who is not precluded from 
performing this function under paragraph (d) of this section. (A doctor 
of podiatric medicine may perform only plan of treatment functions that 
are consistent with the functions he or she is authorized to perform 
under State law.)
    (iv) The services were furnished while the individual was under the 
care of a physician who is a doctor of medicine, osteopathy, or 
podiatric medicine.<SUP>1</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ As a condition of Medicare Part A payment for home health 
services furnished before July 1981, the physician was also required to 
certify that the services were needed for a condition for which the 
individual had received inpatient hosptial or SNF services.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Timing and signature. The certification of need for home health 
services must be obtained at the time the plan of treatment is 
established or as soon thereafter as possible and must be signed by the 
physician who establishes the plan.
    (b) Recertification. (1) Timing and signature of recertification. 
Recertification is required at least every 2 months, preferably at the 
time the plan is reviewed, and must be signed by the physician who 
reviews the plan.
    (2) Content and basis of recertification. The recertification 
statement must indicate the continuing need for services and estimate 
how much longer the services will be required. Need for occupational 
therapy may be the basis for continuing services that were initiated 
because the individual needed skilled nursing care or physical or speech 
therapy.
    (c)  [Reserved]
    (d) Limitations on the performance of certification and plan of 
treatment functions. (1) Basic rule. Beginning November 26, 1982, and 
except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, need for home 
health services to be provided by an HHA may not be certified or 
recertified, and a plan of treatment may not be established and 
reviewed, by any physician who has a significant ownership interest in, 
or a significant financial or contractual relationship with, that HHA.
    (2) Significant ownership interest. A physician is considered to 
have a significant ownership interest in an HHA if he or she--
    (i) Has a direct or indirect ownership interest of 5 percent or more 
in the capital, the stock, or the profits of the home health agency; or
    (ii) Has an ownership interest of 5 percent or more in any mortgage, 
deed of trust, note, or other obligation that is secured by the agency, 
if that interest equals 5 percent or more of the agency's assets.
    (3) Significant financial or contractual relationship. Beginning 
November 26, 1982, a physician is considered to have a significant 
financial or contractual relationship with an HHA if he or she--
    (i) Receives any compensation as an officer or director of the HHA; 
or
    (ii) Has direct or indirect business transactions with the HHA that, 
in any fiscal year, amount to more than $25,000 or 5 percent of the 
agency's total operating expenses, whichever is less. Business 
transactions means contracts, agreements, purchase orders, or leases to 
obtain services, supplies, equipment, and space and, after August 29, 
1986, salaried employment.
    (4) Exemption of uncompensated officer or director. A physician who 
serves as an uncompensated officer or director of an HHA is not 
precluded from performing physician certification and plan of treatment 
functions for that HHA.
    (e) Exceptions to limitations. (1) Exceptions for governmental 
entities. The limitations of paragraph (d) of this section do not apply 
to an HHA that is operated by a Federal, State, or local governmental 
authority.
    (2) Exception for sole community HHAs. The limitations of paragraph 
(d) of this section do not apply on or after the

[[Page 649]]

date on which the HHA is classified as a sole community HHA in 
accordance with paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section.
    (f) Procedures for classification as a sole community HHA. (1) The 
HHA must submit to its intermediary a request for classification, 
showing that it meets the conditions of paragraph (g) of this section.
    (2) The intermediary reviews the request and sends the request, with 
its recommendations, to HCFA.
    (3) HCFA reviews the request and the intermediary's recommendation 
and forwards its approval or disapproval to the intermediary
    (4) An approved classification as sole community HHA remains in 
effect without need for reapproval unless there is a change in the 
circumstances under which the classification was approved.
    (g) Basis for classification as a sole community HHA. HCFA approves 
a classification as a sole community HHA only if the HHA designates a 
particular area and shows that no other HHA provides services within 
that area.

<R05>
Sec. 424.55  Payment to the supplier

    (a) Medicare pays the supplier for covered services if the 
beneficiary (or the person authorized to request payment on the 
beneficiary's behalf) assigns the claim to the supplier and the supplier 
accepts assignment.
    (b) In accepting assignment, the supplier agrees to the following:
    (1) To accept, as full charge for the service, the amount the 
carrier determines to be the reasonable charge.
    (2) To limit charges to the beneficiary or any other source as 
follows:
    (i) To collect nothing for those services for which Medicare pays 
100 percent of the reasonable charge.
    (ii) To collect only the amount of the unmet deductible, plus 20 
percent of the difference between the reasonable charge and the unmet 
deductible for those services for which Medicare pays 80 percent of that 
difference.
    (3) Not to charge the beneficiary when Medicare paid for services 
determined to be ``not reasonable or necessary'' if--
    (i) The beneficiary was without fault in the overpayment; and
    (ii) The determination that the payment was incorrect was made by 
the carrier after the third year following the year in which the carrier 
sent notice to the beneficiary that it approved the payment.


<R05>
Sec. 424.56  Payment to a beneficiary and to a supplier.

    (a) Conditions for split payment. If the beneficiary assigns the 
claim after paying part of the bill, payment may be made partly to the 
beneficiary and partly to the supplier.
    (b) Payment to the supplier. Payment to the supplier who submits the 
assigned claim is for whichever of the following amounts is less:
    (1) The reasonable charge minus the amount the beneficiary had 
already paid to the supplier; or
    (2) The full Part B benefit due for the services furnished.
    (c) Payment to the beneficiary. Any part of the Part B benefit 
which, on the basis of paragraph (b) of this section, is not payable to 
the supplier, is paid to the beneficiary.
    (d) Examples.

    Example 1. An assigned bill of $300 on which partial payment of $100 
has been made is submitted to the carrier. The carrier determines that 
$300 is the reasonable charge for the service furnished. Total payment 
due is 80 percent of $300 or $240. Of this amount, $200 (the difference 
between the $100 partial payment and the $300 reasonable charge) is paid 
to the supplier. The remaining $40 is paid to the beneficiary.
    Example 2. An assigned bill of $325 on which partial payment of $275 
has been made is submitted to the carrier. The carrier determines that 
$275 is the reasonable charge for the services. Total payment due is 80 
percent of $275 or $220. The $220 is paid to the beneficiary, since any 
payment to the supplier, when added to the $275 partial payment would 
exceed the reasonable charge for the services furnished.

Sec. 424.57  Special payment rules for items furnished by DMEPOS suppliers and issuance of DMEPOS supplier billing numbers.

    (a) Definitions. As used in this section ``DMEPOS'' is the acronym 
for durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics and supplies. A 
``supplier'' is an entity or individual, including a physician or part A 
provider, which sells or rents part B covered items to Medicare 
beneficiaries and which meets the standards in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (b) Medicare pays for items furnished by a supplier with a billing 
number to the--
    (1) Supplier if the beneficiary (or the person authorized to request 
payment on the beneficiary's behalf) assigns the claim to the supplier 
and the supplier accepts assignment;
    (2) Beneficiary, if the supplier does not accept assignment; or
    (3) Partly to the beneficiary and partly to the supplier, if the 
supplier accepts assignment of the bill, as described in Sec. 424.56.
    (c) Medicare does not issue a billing number to a supplier that 
submits claims for items listed in Sec. 421.210(b) of this subchapter 
until that supplier meets, and certifies that it meets, the following 
standards. The supplier--
    (1) In response to orders which it receives, fills those orders from 
its own inventory or inventory in other companies with which it has 
contracted to fill such orders or fabricates or fits items for sale from 
supplies it buys under a contract;
    (2) Is responsible for delivery of Medicare covered items to 
Medicare beneficiaries;
    (3) Honors all warranties express and implied under applicable State 
law;
    (4) Answers any questions or complaints a beneficiary has about the 
item or use of the item that was sold or rented to him or her, and 
refers beneficiaries with Medicare questions to the appropriate carrier;
    (5) Maintains and repairs directly or through a service contract 
with another company, items it has rented to beneficiaries;
    (6) Accepts returns of substandard (less than full quality for the 
particular item) or unsuitable items (inappropriate for the beneficiary 
at the time it was fitted and/or sold) from beneficiaries;
    (7) Discloses consumer information to each beneficiary with whom it 
does business which consists of the supplier standards to which it must 
conform;
    (8) Complies with the disclosure provisions in Sec. 420.206;
    (9) Complies with all applicable State and Federal licensure and 
regulatory requirements;
    (10) Maintains a physical facility on an appropriate site; and
    (11) Has proof of appropriate liability insurance.
    (d) If a supplier is found not to meet the standards in paragraph 
(c) of this section, its billing number is revoked, effective 15 days 
after the entity is sent notice of the revocation. A billing number may 
be issued, with the concurrence of HCFA, when a supplier has 
successfully completed a corrective action plan rectifying past 
violations of the supplier standards and provided sufficient assurance 
that it will comply with the supplier standards in the future. 
Corrective action includes repayment of monies due to beneficiaries and 
Medicare, and honoring applicable warranties.
    (e) Suppliers must renew their applications for a billing number 3 
years after the billing numbers are first reissued, except for the first 
reissuance process, as follows: suppliers must renew applications for 
supplier numbers 2 years after initial issuance of billing numbers for 
one third of all suppliers. Another one third of suppliers must reapply 
3 years after initial issuance. The last third of suppliers must reapply 
4 years after initial issuance. Thereafter, each supplier must reapply 3 
years after its last number is issued, unless no claim for an item 
furnished by a supplier has been submitted for four consecutive 
quarters, in which case the supplier must submit a new request for 
another billing number.
    (f) Suppliers are required to have complaint resolution protocols to 
address beneficiary complaints which relate to the supplier standards in 
paragraph (c) of this section and to keep written complaints and related 
correspondence, and any notes of actions taken in response to written or 
oral

[[Page 656]]

complaints. Failure to maintain such information may be considered 
evidence that supplier standards have not been met. If a carrier 
determines that a supplier is not satisfactorily responding to one or 
more beneficiary complaints, the carrier may require that a supplier 
maintain the following information on all written and oral beneficiary 
complaints, including telephone complaints, it receives: The name, 
address, telephone number and health insurance claim number of the 
complaint, a summary of the complaint and the date it was made; the name 
of the person taking the complaint, a summary of any actions taken to 
resolve the complaint; and, if an investigation was not conducted, the 
name of the person making the decision and the reason for the decision.

<R05>
Sec. 424.74  Termination of provider agreement.

continues any other arrangement, that authorizes or permits payment 
contrary to the provisions of this subpart; or
    (b) Fails to furnish, upon request by HCFA or the intermediary,

Medicare may pay under a reassignment established by, or in accordance 
with, the order of a court competent jurisdiction, if the reassignment 
meets the conditions set forth in Sec. 424.90.
    (6) Payment to an agent. Medicare may pay an agent who furnishes 
billing and collection services to the supplier, or to the employer, 
facility, or system specified in paragraphs (b) (1), (2) and (3) of this 
section, if the conditions of Sec. 424.73(b)(3) for payment to a 
provider's agent are met by the agent of the supplier or of the

[[Page 660]]

system. Payment to an agent will always be made in the name of the 
supplier or the employer, facility, or system.
    (c) Rules applicable to an employer, facility, or system. An 
employer, facility, or system that may receive payment under paragraph

Sec. 424.82  Revocation of right to receive assigned benefits.

    (a) Scope. This section sets forth the conditions and procedures for 
revocation of the right of a supplier or other party to receive Medicare 
payments.
    (b) Definition. As used in this section, other party means an 
employer, facility, or health care delivery system to which Medicare may 
make payment under Sec. 424.80(b) (1), (2), or (3).
    (c) Basis for revocation. HCFA may revoke the right of a supplier or 
other party to receive Medicare payments if the supplier or other party, 
after warning by HCFA or the carrier--
    (1) Violates the terms of assignment in Sec. 424.55(b).
    (2) Continues collection efforts or fails to refund moneys 
incorrectly collected, in violation of the terms of assignment in 
Sec. 424.55(b).
    (3) Executes or continues in effect a reassignment or power of 
attorney or any other arrangement that seeks to obtain payment contrary 
to the provisions of Sec. 424.80; or
    (4) Fails to furnish evidence necessary to establish its compliance 
with the requirements of Sec. 424.80.
    (d) Proposed revocation: Notice and opportunity for review. If HCFA 
proposes to revoke the right to payment in accordance with paragraph (c) 
of this section, it will send the supplier or other party a written 
notice that--
    (1) States the reasons for the proposed revocation; and
    (2) Provides an opportunity for the supplier or other party to 
submit written argument and evidence against the proposed revocation. 
HCFA usually allows 15 days from the date on the notice, but may extend 
or reduce the time as circumstances require.
    (e) Actual revocation: Timing, notice, and opportunity for hearing--
(1) Timing. HCFA determines whether to revoke after considering any 
written argument or evidence submitted by the supplier or other party 
or, if none is submitted, at the expiration of the period specified in 
the notice of proposed revocation.
    (2) Notice and opportunity for hearing. The notice of revocation 
specifies--
    (i) The reasons for the revocation;
    (ii) That the revocation is effective as of the date on the notice;
    (iii) That the supplier or other party may, within 60 days from the 
date on the notice (or a longer period if the notice so specifies), 
request an administrative hearing and may be represented by counsel or 
other qualified representative.
    (iv) That the carrier will withhold payment on any claims submitted 
by the supplier or other party until the period for requesting a hearing 
expires or, if a hearing is requested, until the hearing officer issues 
a decision;
    (v) That if the hearing decision reverses the revocation, the 
carrier will pay the supplier's or other party's claims; and
    (vi) That if a hearing is not requested or the hearing decision 
upholds the revocation, payment will be made to the beneficiary or to 
another person or agency authorized to receive payment on his or her 
behalf.

<R05>
Sec. 424.83  Hearings on revocation of right to receive assigned benefits.

    If the supplier or other party requests a hearing under 
Sec. 424.82(e)(2)--
    (a) The hearing is conducted--
    (1) By a HCFA hearing official who was not involved in the decision 
to revoke; and
    (2) In accordance with the procedures set forth in Secs. 405.824 
through 405.833 (but excepting Sec. 405.832(d)) and 405.860 through 
405.872 of this chapter. In applying those procedures, ``HCFA'' is 
substituted for ``carrier''; and ``hearing official'', for ``hearing 
officer''.
    (b) As soon as practicable after the close of the hearing, the 
official who

[[Page 661]]

conducted it issues a hearing decision that--
    (1) Is based on all the evidence presented at the hearing and 
included in the hearing record; and
    (2) Contains findings of fact and a statement of reasons.


<R05>
Sec. 424.84  Final determination on revocation of right to receive assigned benefits.

    (a) Basis of final determination--(1) Final determination without a 
hearing. If the supplier or other party does not request a hearing, 
HCFA's revocation determination becomes final at the end of the period 
specified in the notice of revocation.
    (2) Final determination following a hearing. If there is a hearing, 
the hearing decision constitutes HCFA's final determination.
    (b) Notice of final determination. HCFA sends the supplier or other 
party a written notice of the final determination and, if there was a 
hearing, includes a copy of the hearing decision.
    (c) Application of the final determination--(1) A final 
determination not to revoke is the final administrative decision by HCFA 
on the matter.
    (2) A final determination to revoke remains in effect until HCFA 
finds that the reason for the revocation has been removed and that there 
is reasonable assurance that it will not recur.
    (d) Effect of revocation when supplier or other party has a 
financial interest in another entity. Revocation of the party's right to 
accept assignment also applies to any corporation, partnership, or other 
entity in which the party, directly or indirectly, has or acquires all 
or all but a nominal part of the financial interest.

[53 FR 6644, Mar. 2, 1988; 53 FR 12945, Apr. 20, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 424.86  Prohibition of assignment of claims by beneficiaries.

    (a) Basic prohibition. Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section, Medicare does not pay amounts that are due a beneficiary under 
Sec. 424.53 to any other person under assignment, power of attorney, or 
any other direct payment arrangement.
    (b) Exceptions--(1) Payment to a government agency or entity. 
Subject to the requirements of the Assignment of Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 
3727), Medicare may pay a government agency or entity under an 
assignment by a beneficiary (or by the beneficiary's legal guardian or 
representative payee).
    (2) Payment under an assignment established by court order. Medicare 
may pay under an assignment established by, or in accordance with, a 
court order if the assignment meets the conditions set forth in 
Sec. 424.90.


<R05>
Sec. 424.90  Court ordered assignments: Conditions and limitations.

    (a) Conditions for acceptance. An assignment or reassignment 
established by or in accordance with a court order is effective for 
Medicare payments only if--
    (1) Someone files a certified copy of the court order and of the 
executed assignment or reassignment (if it was necessary to execute one) 
with the intermediary or carrier responsible for processing the claim; 
and
    (2) The assignment or reassignment--
    (i) Applies to all Medicare benefits payable to a particular person 
or entity during a specified or indefinite time period; or
    (ii) Specifies a particular amount of money, payable to a particular 
person or entity by a particular intermediary or carrier.
    (b) Retention of authority to reduce interim payments to providers. 
A court-ordered assignment does not preclude the intermediary or carrier 
from reducing interim payments, as set forth in Sec. 413.64(i) of this 
chapter, if the provider or assignee is in imminent danger of insolvency 
or bankruptcy.
    (c) Liability of the parties. The party that receives payments under 
a court-ordered assignment or reassignment that meets the conditions of 
paragraph (a) of this section and the party that would have received 
payment if the court order had not been issued are jointly and severally 
responsible for any Medicare overpayment to the former.

<R04>
    Subpart G--Special Conditions: Emergency Services Furnished by a 
                        Nonparticipating Hospital


<R05>
Sec. 424.100  Scope.

    This subpart sets forth procedures and criteria that are followed in 
determining whether Medicare will pay for emergency services furnished 
by a hospital that is located in the United States and does not have in 
effect a provider agreement, that is, an agreement to participate in 
Medicare.


<R05>
Sec. 424.101  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, unless the context indicates otherwise--
    Emergency services means inpatient or outpatient hospital services 
that are necessary to prevent death or serious impairment of health and, 
because of the danger to life or health, require use of the most 
accessible hospital available and equipped to furnish those services.
    Hospital means a facility that--
    (1) Is primarily engaged in providing, by or under the supervision 
of doctors of medicine or osteopathy, inpatient services for the 
diagnosis, treatment, and care or rehabilitation of persons who are 
sick, injured, or disabled;
    (2) Is not primarily engaged in providing skilled nursing care and 
related services for patients who require medical or nursing care, as 
described in section 1861(j)(1)(A) of the Act;
    (3) Provides 24-hour nursing service in accordance with section 
1861(e)(5) of the Act; and
    (4) Is licensed, or is approved as meeting the standards for 
licensing, by the State or local licensing agency.
    Reasonable charges means customary charges insofar as they are 
reasonable.


<R05>
Sec. 424.102  Situations that do not constitute an emergency.

    Without additional evidence of a threat to life or health, the 
following situations do not in themselves indicate a need for emergency 
services:
    (a) Lack of care at home.
    (b) Lack of transportation to a participating hospital.
    (c) Death of the patient in the hospital.


<R05>
Sec. 424.103  Conditions for payment for emergency services.

    Medicare pays for emergency services furnished to a beneficiary by a 
nonparticipating hospital or under arrangements made by such a hospital 
if the conditions of this section are met.
    (a) General requirements. (1) The services are of the type that 
Medicare would pay for if they were furnished by a participating 
hospital.
    (2) The hospital has in effect an election to claim payment for all 
emergency services furnished in a calendar year in accordance with 
Sec. 424.104.
    (3) The need for emergency services arose while the beneficiary was 
not an inpatient in a hospital.
    (4) In the case of inpatient hospital services, the services are 
furnished during a period in which the beneficiary could not be safely 
discharged or transferred to a participating hospital or other 
institution.
    (5) The determination that the hospital was the most accessible 
hospital available and equipped to furnish the services is made in 
accordance with Sec. 424.106.
    (b) Medical information requirements. A physician (or, if 
appropriate, the hospital) submits medical information that--
    (1) Describes the nature of the emergency and specifies why it 
required that the beneficiary be treated in the most accessible 
hospital;
    (2) Establishes that all the conditions in paragraph (a) of this 
section are met; and
    (3) Indicates when the emergency ended, which, for inpatient 
hospital services, is the earliest date on which the beneficiary could 
be safely discharged or transferred to a participating hospital or other 
institution.


<R05>
Sec. 424.104  Election to claim payment for emergency services furnished during a calendar year.

    (a) Terms of the election. The hospital agrees to the following:
    (1) To comply with the provisions of subpart C of part 489 of this 
chapter relating to charges for items and services the hospital may make 
to the beneficiary, or any other person on his or her behalf.

[[Page 663]]

    (2) To comply with the provisions of subpart D of part 489 of this 
chapter relating to proper disposition of monies incorrectly collected 
from, or on behalf of a beneficiary.
    (3) To request payment under the Medicare program based on amounts 
specified in Sec. 413.74 of this chapter.
    (b) Filing of election statement. An election statement must be 
filed on a form designated by HCFA, signed by an authorized official of 
the hospital, and either received by HCFA, or postmarked, before the 
close of the calendar year of election.
    (c) Acceptance and effective date of election. If HCFA accepts the 
election statement, the election is effective as of the earliest day of 
the calendar year of election from which HCFA determines the hospital 
has been in continuous compliance with the requirements of section 
1814(d) of the Act.
    (d) Appeal by hospital. Any hospital dissatisfied with a 
determination that it does not qualify to claim reimbursement shall be 
entitled to appeal the determination as provided in part 498 of this 
chapter.
    (e) Conditions for reinstatement after notice of failure to continue 
to qualify. If HCFA has notified a hospital that it no longer qualifies 
to receive reimbursement for a calendar year, HCFA will not accept 
another election statement from that hospital until HCFA finds that--
    (1) The reason for its failure to qualify has been removed; and
    (2) There is reasonable assurance that it will not recur.


<R05>
Sec. 424.106  Criteria for determining whether the hospital was the most accessible.

    (a) Basic requirement. (1) The hospital must be the most accessible 
one available and equipped to furnish the services.
    (2) HCFA determines accessibility based on the factors specified in 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and the conditions set forth in 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) Factors that are considered. HCFA considers the following 
factors in determining whether a nonparticipating hospital in a rural 
area meets the accessibility requirements:
    (1) The relative distances of participating and nonparticipating 
hospitals in the area.
    (2) The transportation facilities available to these hospitals.
    (3) The quality of the roads to each hospital.
    (4) The availability of beds at each hospital.
    (5) Any other factors that bear on whether or not the services could 
be provided sooner in the nonparticipating hospitals than in a 
participating hospital in the general area.

In urban and suburban areas where both participating and 
nonparticipating hospitals are similarly available, HCFA presumes that 
the services could have been provided in a participating hospital unless 
clear and convincing evidence shows that there was a medical or 
practical need to use the nonparticipating hospital.
    (c) Factors that are not considered. HCFA gives no consideration to 
the following factors in determining whether the nonparticipating 
hospital was the most accessible hospital:
    (1) The personal preference of the beneficiary, the physician, or 
members of the family.
    (2) The fact that the attending physician did not have staff 
privileges in a participating hospital which was available and the most 
accessible to the beneficiary.
    (3) The location of previous medical records.
    (d) Conditions under which the accessibility requirement is met. If 
a beneficiary must be taken to a hospital immediately for required 
diagnosis and treatment, the nonparticipating hospital meets the 
accessibility requirement if--
    (1) It was the nearest hospital to the point where the emergency 
occurred, it was medically equipped to handle the type of emergency, and 
it was the most accessible, on the basis of the factors specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section; or
    (2) There was a closer participating hospital equipped to handle the 
emergency, but the participating hospital did not have a bed available 
or would not accept the individual.

[[Page 664]]


<R05>
Sec. 424.108  Payment to a hospital.

    (a) Conditions for payment. Medicare pays the hospital for emergency

    (2) Claims payment in accordance with Sec. 424.32; and
    (3) Submits evidence requested by HCFA to establish that the 
services meet the requirements of this subpart.
    (b) Subsequent claims. If the hospital files subsequent claims 
because the initial claim did not include all the services furnished, 
those claims must include physicians' statements that--
    (1) Contain sufficient information to clearly establish that, when 
the additional services were furnished, the emergency still existed; and
    (2) Indicate when the emergency ended, which, for inpatient hospital 
services, is the earliest date on which the beneficiary could be safely 
discharged or transferred to a participating hospital or other 
institution.

Department disbursing center responsible for issuing checks.
    (3) Action by the Treasury Department. The Treasury Department will 
replace and begin reclamation of Treasury checks in accordance with 
Treasury Department regulations (31 CFR parts 235, 240, and 245).
    (b) Intermediary and carrier benefit checks. Checks issued by 
intermediaries and carriers are drawn on commercial banks and are not 
subject to the Federal laws and Treasury Department regulations that 
govern Treasury checks. Replacement procedures are carried out in 
accordance with Sec. 424.352 under applicable State law (including any 
Federal banking laws or regulations that may affect the relevant State 
proceedings).

[58 FR 65129, Dec. 13, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 424.352  Intermediary and carrier checks that are lost, stolen, defaced, mutilated, destroyed or paid on forged endorsements.

    (a) When an intermediary or carrier is notified by a payee that a 
check has been lost, stolen, defaced, mutilated, destroyed, or paid on 
forged endorsement, the intermediary or carrier contacts the commercial 
bank on whose paper the check was drawn and determines whether the check 
has been negotiated.
    (b) If the check has been negotiated--
    (1) The intermediary or carrier provides the payee with a copy of 
the check and other pertinent information (such as a claim form, 
affidavit or questionnaire to be completed by the payee) required to 
pursue his or her claim in accordance with State law and commercial 
banking regulations.
    (2) To pursue the claim, the payee must examine the check and 
certify (by completing the claim form, questionnaire or affidavit) that 
the endorsement is not the payee's.
    (3) The claim form and other pertinent information is sent to the 
intermediary or carrier for review and processing of the claim.
    (4) The intermediary or carrier reviews the payee's claim. If the 
intermediary or carrier determines that the claim appears to be valid, 
it forwards the claim and a copy of the check to the issuing bank. The 
intermediary or carrier takes further action to recover the proceeds of 
the check in accordance with the State law and regulations.
    (5) Once the intermediary or carrier recovers the proceeds of the 
initial check, the intermediary or carrier issues a replacement check to 
the payee.
    (6) If the bank of first deposit refuses to settle on the check for 
good cause, the payee must pursue the claim on his or her own and the 
intermediary or carrier will not reissue the check to the payee.
    (c) If the check has not been negotiated--
    (1) The intermediary or carrier arranges with the bank to stop 
payment on the check; and
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (d), the intermediary or carrier 
reissues the check to the payee.
    (d) No check may be reissued under (c)(2) unless the claim for a 
replacement check is received by the intermediary or carrier no later 
than 1 year from the date of issuance of the original check, unless 
State law (including any applicable Federal banking laws or regulations 
that may affect the relevant State proceeding) provides a longer period 
which will control.
