                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 1997), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

    Title 48--Federal Acquisition Regulations System is composed of 
eight volumes. The chapters in these volumes are arranged as follows: 
Chapter 1 (parts 1 to 51), chapter 1 (parts 52 to 99), chapter 2 (parts 
201 to 299), chapters 3 to 6, chapters 7 to 14, chapters 15 to 28 and 
chapter 29 to end. The contents of these volumes represent all current 
regulations codified under this title of the CFR as of October 1, 1997.

    The Federal acquisition regulations in chapter 1 are those 
government-wide acquisition regulations jointly issued by the General 
Services Administration, the Department of Defense, and the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration. Chapters 2 through 99 are 
acquisition regulations issued by individual government agencies. Parts 
1 to 69 in each of chapters 2 through 99 are reserved for agency 
regulations implementing the Federal acquisition regulations in chapter 
1 and are numerically keyed to them. Parts 70 to 99 in chapters 2 
through 99 contain agency regulations supplementing the Federal 
acquisition regulations.

    The OMB control numbers for the Federal Acquisition Regulations 
System appear in section 1.106 of chapter 1. For the convenience of the 
user section 1.106 is reprinted in the Finding Aids section of the 
second volume containing chapter 1 (parts 52 to 99).

    The first volume, containing chapter 1 (parts 1 to 51), includes an 
index to the Federal acquisition regulations.

       Subpart 1501.6--Contracting Authority and Responsibilities


<R05>
1501.602-3  Ratification of unauthorized commitments.

    (a) Applicability. The provisions of this section apply to all 
unauthorized commitments, whether oral or written and without regard to 
dollar value. Examples of unauthorized commitments are;
    (1) Ordering supplies or services by an individual without 
contracting authority;
    (2) Unauthorized direction of work through assignment of orders or 
tasks;
    (3) Unauthorized addition of new work;
    (4) Unauthorized direction of contractors to subcontract with 
particular firms; or
    (5) Any other unauthorized direction which changed the terms and 
conditions of the contract.
    (b) Ratification approvals and concurrences. (1) The Chief of the 
Contracting Office is the ratifying official, provided that he/she has 
redelegable contracting authority.
    (2) For ratification actions which arise in regional offices or 
laboratory sites, the Chief of the Contracting Office to whom the 
activity functionally reports is the ratifying official.
    (3) All proposed ratification actions of $250,000 or more for which 
the Chief of the Contracting Office is not the ratifying official shall 
be forwarded for review to the responsible PCMD Associate Director prior 
to approval by the ratifying official.
    (c) Procedures. (1) The program office shall notify the cognizant 
contracting

[[Page 7]]

office by memorandum of the circumstances surrounding an unauthorized 
commitment. The notification shall include:
    (i) All relevant documents and records;
    (ii) Documentation of the necessity for the work and benefit derived 
by the Government;
    (iii) A statement of the delivery status of the supplies or services 
associated with the unauthorized commitment;
    (iv) A list of the procurement sources solicited (if any) and the 
rationale for the source selected;
    (v) If only one source was solicited, a justification for other than 
full and open competition (JOFOC) as required by FAR 6.302, FAR 6.303, 
and 1506.303, or for simplified acquisition procedures exceeding the 
competition threshold in FAR 13.106, a sole source justification as 
required by 1513.170;
    (vi) A statement of steps taken or proposed to prevent reoccurrence 
of any unauthorized commitment.
    (2) The Division Director (or equivalent) of the responsible office 
shall approve the memorandum. If expenditure of funds is involved, the 
program office shall include a Procurement Request/Order, EPA Form 1900-
8, with funding sufficient to cover the action. The appropriation data 
cited on the 1900-8 shall be valid for the period in which the 
unauthorized commitment was made.
    (3) Upon receiving the notification, the Contracting Officer shall 
prepare a determination and findings regarding ratification of the 
unauthorized commitment for the ratifying official. The determination 
and findings shall include sufficient detail to support the recommended 
action. If ratification of the unauthorized commitment is recommended, 
the determination and findings shall include a determination that the 
price is fair and reasonable. To document the determination, additional 
information may be required from the Contractor. Concurrence by the 
Office of General Counsel is not mandatory, but shall be sought in 
difficult or unusual cases.
    (4) The ratifying official may inform the Inspector General (IG) of 
the action by memorandum through the Head of the Contracting Activity 
(HCA). For ratification actions exceeding the small purchase limitation, 
the ratifying official shall submit a memorandum to the Assistant 
Administrator for Administration and Resources Management through the 
HCA for transmittal to the Assistant, Associate, or Regional 
Administrator (or equivalent level) of the person responsible for the 
unauthorized commitment. This memorandum should contain a brief 
description of the circumstances surrounding the unauthorized 
commitment, recommend corrective action, and include a copy of any 
memorandum sent to the IG. Submission of a memorandum to the appropriate 
Assistant, Associate, or Regional Administrator for unauthorized 
commitments at or below the small purchase limitation is optional and 
may be accomplished at the discretion of the ratifying official.
    (d) Paid Advertisements. (1) EPA is generally not authorized to 
ratify improperly ordered paid advertisements. The ratifying official, 
however, may determine payment is proper subject to the limitations in 
FAR 1.602-3(c) if the individual responsible for the unauthorized 
commitment acted in good faith to comply with Agency acquisition 
policies and procedures.
    (2) The paying office shall forward invoice claims received in its 
office for improper paid advertisements to the cognizant ratifying 
official for a determination regarding ratification of the action.
    (3) If the ratifying official determines that an unauthorized 
commitment cannot be ratified by the Agency, the ratifying official 
shall instruct the submitter to present its claim to the General 
Accounting Office in accordance with the instructions contained in 4 CFR 
part 31, Claims Against the United States, General Procedures.
    (e) Payment of Properly Ratified Claims. After the unauthorized 
commitment is ratified, the Contractor must submit an invoice (or 
resubmit an invoice if one was previously submitted)

    In addition to those procedures set forth in FAR 4.804-5, the 
contracting office shall, before final payment is made under a cost 
reimbursement type contract, verify the allowability, allocability, and 
reasonableness of costs claimed. Verification of total costs incurred

group at the contracting office in the form of a final audit report. 
Similar verification of actual costs shall be made for other contracts 
when cost incentives, price redeterminations, or cost-reimbursement 
elements are involved. Termination settlement proposals shall be 
submitted to the cost advisory group at the contracting office for 
review by the Office of Audit as prescribed by FAR 49.107. All such 
audits will be coordinated through the cost advisory group in the 
contracting office. Exceptions to these procedures are the quick close-

<R05>
1506.302-5  Authorized or required by statute.

    (a) Authority. Section 109(e) of the Superfund Amendments and 
Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) is cited as authority.
    (b) Application. (1) The contracting officer may use other than full 
and open competition to acquire the services of experts for use in 
preparing or prosecuting a civil or criminal action under SARA whether 
or not the expert is expected to testify at trial. The contracting 
officer need not prepare the written justification under FAR 6.303 when 
acquiring expert services under the authority of section 109(e) of SARA. 
The contracting officer shall document the official contract file when 
using this authority.
    (2) The contracting officer shall give notice to the Agency's 
Competition Advocate whenever a contract award is made using other than 
full and open competitition under this authority. The notice shall 
contain a copy of the contract and the summary of negotiations.
[53 FR 31872, Aug. 22, 1988]


<R05>
1506.303-2  Content.

    The documentation requirements in this section apply only to 
acquisitions processed using other than small purchase procedures. 
(Refer to 1513.170 for documentation for small purchase acquisitions).
    (a) The initiating office shall prepare a written justification for 
other than full and open competition (JOFOC) that documents the facts 
and circumstances substantiating the infeasibility of full and open 
competition for each recommended limited sources or sole source 
acquisition when required by FAR 6.302.
    (b) The recommendation shall be entitled ``Justification for Other 
Than Full and Open Competition'' and shall be signed at the programmatic 
Division Director or comparable office level prior to submission with 
the procurement request. The JOFOC shall contain the information 
prescribed in FAR 6.303-2 (a) and (b).
    (c) If unusual and compelling urgency (see FAR 6.303-2) is a basis 
for the JOFOC, then the following applies. Explain the circumstances 
that led to the need for an urgent contractual action. Explain why the 
requirement could not have been processed in sufficient time to permit 
full and open competition. It should be noted that the existence of 
legislation, court order, or Presidential mandate is not, of itself, a 
sufficient basis for a JOFOC. However, the circumstances necessitating 
legislation, court order, or Presidential mandate may justify 
contractual action on an other than full and open competition basis.
    (d) If the proposed acquisition has been synopsized in accordance 
with the applicable requirements in FAR subpart 5.2, the Contracting 
Officer must incorporate the evaluation of responses to the synopsis in 
the JOFOC. (See 1506.371(d) for contents of the evaluation document).

        Subpart 1509.4--Debarment, Suspension, and Ineligibility


<R05>
1509.403  Definitions.

    The Director, Grants Administration Division, is designated the 
``debarring official'' and the ``suspending official'' as defined in FAR 
9.403 and is designated as the agency official authorized to make the 
decisions required in FAR 9.405(a), 9.405-1(b), 9.405-2, 9.406-1(c), and 
9.407-1(d).


<R05>
1509.404  Parties excluded from Federal procurement and nonprocurement programs.

    The Director, Office of Grants and Debarment (or designee) is 
responsible for notifying GSA in accordance with FAR 9.404(c).

<R05>
1509.406  Debarment.


<R05>
1509.406-3  Procedures.

    (a) Investigation and referral--(1) Contracting Officer 
responsibility. (i) When contracting personnel discover information 
which indicates that a cause for debarment or suspension may exist, they 
shall promptly report such information by memorandum to the cognizant 
Chief of the Contracting Office. Purchasing agents in the small purchase 
activities which do not come under the cognizance of the Headquarters, 
Research Triangle Park (RTP), or Cincinnati contracting offices shall 
report such information by memorandum directly to the Head of the 
Contracting Activity (HCA).
    (ii) Contracting Officers shall review the GSA consolidated list to 
ensure that the Agency does not solicit offers from, award contracts to, 
or consent to subcontract with listed contractors.
    (2) Chief of the Contracting Office responsibility. When the Chief 
of the Contracting Office determines that sufficient information exists 
to support the reasonable belief that a cause for debarment or 
suspension may exist, such information shall be promptly reported by 
memorandum to the HCA. The memorandum to the HCA may be a cover 
memorandum which forwards the Contracting Officer's memorandum and 
provides the Chief of the Contracting Office's assessment of the 
information,

[[Page 15]]

any investigative report or audit, and any additional information he/she 
has discovered.
    (3) HCA responsibility. Upon receipt of a report of a suspected 
debarment or suspension situation, the HCA or the designee shall take 
the following actions:
    (i) Notify the Debarring Official that investigation of a potential 
debarment has been initiated.
    (ii) Review the reported information.
    (iii) Investigate as necessary to verify or develop additional 
information. Request investigative support from the EPA Inspector 
General when appropriate.
    (iv) Refer the matter to the Debarring Official for consideration of 
debarment; or recommend to the Debarring Official that the matter be 
closed without further action because the facts do not constitute a 
cause for debarment.
    (v) Obtain legal counsel's opinion on referrals or recommendations 
made to the Debarring Official.
    (vi) Notify EPA Contracting Officers of those Contractors who are 
ineligible for solicitation, award, or subcontracting but who do not 
appear on the GSA Consolidated List; e.g., those who are ineligible 
based on a settlement reached by the Debarring Official under which the 
Contractor has agreed to voluntarily exclude itself from participation 
in Government contracting/subcontracting for a specified period or 
because of a Notice of Proposal to Debar.
    (4) Debarring Official's responsibility. The Debarring Official 
shall:
    (i) Review referrals from the HCA together with the HCA's 
recommendations, if any, and determine whether further consideration by 
the Debarring Official is warranted and take such actions as are 
required by FAR subpart 9.4;
    (ii) Obtain the HCA's recommendation prior to reaching a voluntary 
exclusion settlement with a Contractor in lieu of debarment;
    (iii) Promptly notify the HCA of Contractors with whom a settlement 
in lieu of debarment has been reached under which the Contractor 
voluntarily excludes itself from or restricts its participation in 
Government contracting/subcontracting for a specified period; and of 
Contractors who have received a Notice of Proposal to Debar.

1509.407  Suspension.


<R05>

<R04>
          Subpart 1509.5--Organizational Conflicts of Interests


<R05>
1509.500  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart establishes EPA policy and procedures for identifying, 
evaluating, and resolving organizational conflicts of interest. EPA's 
policy is to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate organizational conflicts of 
interest. If EPA is unable to neutralize or mitigate the effects of a 
potential conflict of interest, EPA will disqualify the prospective 
contractor or will terminate the contract when potential or actual 
conflicts are identified after award.
[49 FR 8839, Mar. 8, 1984; 49 FR 24734, June 15, 1984]


<R05>
1509.502  Applicability.

    This subpart applies to all EPA contracts except agreements with 
other Federal agencies. However, this subpart applies to contracts with 
the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the 8(a) program.


<R05>
1509.503  Waiver.

    The Head of the Contracting Activity may waive any general rule or 
procedure of this subpart by determining that its application in a 
particular situation would not be in the Government's interest. Any 
request for waiver must be in accordance with FAR 9.503. The Assistant 
General Counsel for Contracts and Information Law shall be consulted on 
such waiver requests.
[49 FR 8839, Mar. 8, 1984, as amended at 61 FR 29316, June 10, 1996]


<R05>
1509.505-4  Obtaining access to proprietary information.

    Contractors gaining access to confidential business information of 
other

[[Page 16]]

companies in performing advisory services for EPA shall comply with the 
special requirements of 40 CFR part 2 and the provisions of their 
contracts relating to the treatment of confidential business 
information.


<R05>
1509.505-70  Information sources.

    (a) Disclosure. Prospective EPA Contractors responding to 
solicitations or submitting unsolicited proposals shall provide 
information to the Contracting Officer for use in identifying, 
evaluating, or resolving potential organizational conflicts of interest. 
The submittal may be a certification or a disclosure, pursuant to 
paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section.
    (1) If the prospective contractor is not aware of any information 
bearing on the existence of any organizational conflict of interest, it 
may so certify.
    (2) Prospective contractors not certifying in accordance with 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section must provide a disclosure statement 
which describes concisely all relevant facts concerning any past, 
present, or planned interests relating to the work to be performed and 
bearing on whether they, including their chief executives, directors, or 
any proposed consultant or subcontractor, may have a potential 
organizational conflict of interest.
    (b) Failure to disclose information. Any prospective contractor 
failing to provide full disclosure, certification, or other required 
information will not be eligible for award. Nondisclosure or 
misrepresentation of any relevant information may also result in 
disqualification from award, termination of the contract for default, or 
debarment from Government contracts, as well as other legal action or 
prosecution. In response to solicitations, EPA will consider any 
inadvertent failure to provide disclosure certification as a ``minor 
informality'' (as explained in FAR 14.405); however, the prospective 
contractor must correct the omission promptly.
    (c) Exception. Where the Contractor has previously submitted a 
conflict of interest certification or disclosure for a contract, only an 
update of such statement is required when the contract is modified.
[49 FR 8839, Mar. 8, 1994. Redesignated at 59 FR 18619, Apr. 19, 1994]


<R05>
1509.507-1  Solicitation provisions.

    (a) Advance notice of limitations. The Contracting Officer shall 
alert prospective contractors by placing a notice in the solicitation 
whenever a particular acquisition might create an organizational 
conflict of interest. The notice will:
    (1) Include the information prescribed in (FAR) 48 CFR 9.507-1;
    (2) Refer prospective contractors to this subpart; and
    (3) Require proposers to disclose relevant facts concerning any 
past, present, or currently planned interests relating to the work 
described in the solicitation.
    (b) Required solicitation provision. The Contracting Officer shall 
include the provisions at 1552.209-70 and 1552.209-72 in all 
solicitations, except where the following applies:
    (1) An Organizational Conflict of Interest provision is drafted for 
a particular acquisition (see Section 1509.507-1(a));
    (2) When the procurement is with another Federal agency (however, 
the provision is included in solicitations issued under the Small 
Business Administration's (SBA) 8(a) program); and
    (3) When the procurement is accomplished through simplified 
acquisition procedures, use of the provision is optional.
[49 FR 8839, Mar. 8, 1994. Redesignated and amended at 59 FR 18619, Apr.

<R05>
1509.507-2  Contract clause.

    (a) The Contracting Officer shall include the clause at 1552.209-71 
in all contracts in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold and, 
as appropriate, in simplified acquisition procedures. Contracts for 
other than Superfund work shall include Alternate I in this clause in 
lieu of paragraph (e).
    (b) The Contracting Officer shall include the clause at 1552.209-73 
in all solicitations and contracts for Superfund work in excess of the 
simplified acquisition threshold and, as appropriate, in small purchases 
for Superfund work.

[[Page 17]]

    (c) The Contracting Officer shall include the clause at 1552.209-74 
or its alternates in the following solicitations and contracts for 
Superfund work in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold and, as 
appropriate, in simplified acquisition procedures for Superfund work. 
The Contracting Officer shall include the clause at 1552.209-74 in all 
Alternative Remedial Contracting Strategy (ARCS) solicitations and 
contracts, except Site Specific solicitations and contracts. Alternate I 
shall be used in all Time Critical Rapid Response (TCRR) solicitations 
and contracts, except site specific solicitations and contracts. The 
term ``TCRR'' in the Limitation of Future Contracting clauses includes 
not only TCRR solicitations and contracts but Emergency Response Cleanup 
Services (ERCS) and other emergency type solicitations and contracts. 
TCRR pilot scale studies are included in the term ``treatability 
studies''. Alternate II shall be used in all Technical Assistance Team 
(TAT) solicitations and contracts. Alternate III shall be used in all 
Environmental Services Assistance Team (ESAT) solicitations and 
contracts. Alternate IV shall be used in all Technical Enforcement 
Support (TES) solicitations and contracts. Alternate V shall be used in 
all Superfund Headquarters Support solicitations and contracts. The 
Contracting Officer is authorized to modify paragraph (c) of Alternate V 
to reflect any unique limitations applicable to the program 
requirements. Alternate VI shall be used in all Site Specific 
solicitations and contracts.
    (d) The Contracting Officer shall insert the clause at 1552.209-75 
in Superfund solicitations and contracts in excess of the simplified 
acquisition threshold, where the solicitation or contract does not 
include (EPAAR) 48 CFR 1552.211-74, Work Assignments, Alternate I, or a 
similar clause requiring conflict of interest certifications during 
contract performance. This clause requires an annual conflict of 
interest certification from contractors when the contract does not 
require the submission of other conflict of interest certifications 
during contract performance. Contracts requiring annual certifications 
include: Site Specific contracts, the Contract Laboratory Program (CLP), 
and the Sample Management Office (SMO) contracts. The annual 
certification requires a contractor to certify that all organizational 
conflicts of interest have been reported, and that its personnel 
performing work under EPA contracts or relating to EPA contracts have 
been informed of their obligation to report personal and organizational 
conflicts of interest to the Contractor. The annual certification shall 
cover the one-year period from the date of contract award for the 
initial certification, and a one-year period starting from the previous 
certification for subsequent certifications. The certification must be 
received by the Contracting Officer no later than 45 days after the 
close of the certification period covered.

1515.507  Contracting methods.

    The Department of Housing and Urban Development-Independent Agencies 
Appropriation Act contains a requirement that none of the funds provided 
in the Act may be used for payment through grants or contracts to 
recipients that do not share in the cost of conducting research 
resulting from proposals that are not specifically solicited by the 
Government. Accordingly, contracts which result from unsolicited 
proposals shall provide for the Contractor to bear a portion of the cost 
of performance for work subject to the Act. However, where there is no 
measurable gain to the performing organization, cost sharing is not 
required.

<R05>
1515.604  Responsibilities and duties.

    In addition to those cited in FAR 15.604, the following 
responsibilities and duties are assigned:
    (a) Source Selection Official. The Source Selection Official (SSO) 
is the official responsible for overall management of the source 
selection process. Duties of the SSO include, but are not limited to, 
appointing members and chairpersons of the Source Evaluation Board and 
the Technical Evaluation Panel (TEP); and approving solicitation related 
documents. However, the Contracting Officer is responsible for approving 
amendments to solicitation documents. The SSO may waive in writing the 
requirement in 1515.612(a)(1)(v) for at least one member of the TEP to 
be an individual not involved in managing the current contract. The SSO 
also approves the competitive range determination and makes the source 
selection decision.
    (b) Source Evaluation Board. The Source Evaluation Board (SEB) 
consists of a chairperson who is responsible for all of the procedural 
and administrative aspects of the SEB, and other specialists, e.g., 
technical, procurement, and financial, as may be deemed appropriate by 
the SSO. An attorney from the Office of General Counsel should serve in 
an advisory role to the SEB. The SEB makes recommendations to the SSO on 
selection of a contractor for award.
    (c) Technical Evaluation Panel (TEP). The Program Office has the 
responsibility for developing the technical evaluation criteria and 
statement of work for the solicitation. The TEP has the responsibility 
for evaluating the technical aspects of the offerors' technical 
proposals. Based on the recommendation of the Program Office, the SSO 
has the discretion of assigning this evaluation responsibility to the 
Project Officer, if appropriate, or to the TEP. When offerors' past 
performance is evaluated as part of the technical proposal evaluation 
process, the past performance evaluation shall be

[[Page 23]]

conducted by the TEP, or by the Contracting Officer and the Project 
Officer. Based on input from the Project Officer, the Contracting 
Officer has the discretion of assigning this responsibility to the TEP 
or to the Contracting Officer and Project Officer.

<R05>
1515.604-70  Personal conflicts of interests.

    (a) Only regular or special Government employees of EPA as defined 
in 40 CFR 3.102, or where appropriate, other Federal Government 
agencies, may participate in the evaluation and selection process. In 
the event an outside evaluation is to be obtained, non-Government 
employees may participate only if the procedures in FAR 15.413-2(f) and 
1515.413 are followed.
    (b) Each EPA employee (including special employees) engaged in 
source evaluation and selection is required to be familiar with the 
provisions of 40 CFR part 3 regarding personal conflicts of interests. 
The employee shall inform the Source Selection Official in writing if 
his/her participation in the source evaluation and selection process 
could be interpreted as a possible or apparent conflict of interest. The 
SSO shall relieve any EPA employee who has a conflict of interest of 
further duties in connection with the evaluation and selection process.
    (c) Each EPA employee (including special employees (as defined by 
1503.600-71 (b)) involved in source evaluation and selection is required 
to comply with the Office of Government Ethics ethics provisions at 5 
CFR Part 2635.
[49 FR 8843, Mar. 8, 1984, as amended at 53 FR 38293, Sept. 30, 1988; 61 
FR 47066, Sept. 6, 1996]


<R05>
1515.605  Evaluation factors.

    The evaluation factors that will be considered in making the source 
selection and their relative importance shall be included in ``Part IV, 
Section M, Evaluation Factors for Award,'' in each solicitation.
    (a) The Contracting Officer shall insert the provisions at 1552.215-
70, ``EPA Source Evaluation and Selection Procedures--Negotiated 
Procurement'' and either: the provision in 1552.215-71, ``Evaluation 
Factors for Award,'' where all evaluation factors other than cost or 
price when combined are significantly more important than cost or price; 
or the provision in Alternate I to 1552.215-71, where all evaluation 
factors other than cost or price when combined are significantly less 
important than cost or price; or the provision in Alternate II to 
1552.215-71, where award will be made to the offeror with the lowest-
evaluated cost or price whose technical proposal meets the minimum needs 
of the Government; or the provision in Alternate III where all 
evaluation factors other than cost or price when combined are 
approximately equal to cost or price. The Contracting Officer may use 
provisions substantially the same as 1552.215-71, Alternate I to 
1552.215-71, Alternate II to 1552.215-71, or Alternate III to 1552.215-
71 without requesting a deviation to the EPAAR.
    (b) Technical evaluation criteria should be prepared in accordance 
with FAR 15.605 and inserted into paragraph (b) of the provision at 
1552.215-71, Alternate I, and Alternate III. If technical evaluation 
criteria are used in Alternate II, the criteria should be prepared in 
accordance with FAR 15.605 and inserted into paragraph (b). When past 
performance is to be used as an evaluation factor, the Contracting 
Officer must develop criteria for evaluating past performance and 
include such criteria in section M of the solicitation.
    (c) Evaluation Methodologies. Evaluation criteria may be developed 
using methodologies other than numerical scoring, e.g., adjectival 
ratings or color scoring. The relative importance of the evaluation 
criteria must be clearly identified in the solicitation. The Contracting 
Officer should identify and prepare evaluation criteria consistent with 
FAR 15.605.
[49 FR 8843, Mar. 8, 1984, as amended at 61 FR 47066, Sept. 6, 1996]


<R05>
1515.608  Proposal evaluation.

    (a) The initial technical evaluations of proposals shall be 
conducted in accordance with the following procedures.

[[Page 24]]

    (1) The evaluation of technical proposals (including past 
performance factors) shall be accomplished using the following scoring 
plan or one specifically developed for the solicitation, e.g., other 
numeric, adjectival or color rating systems. Contracting Officers may 
request that the TEP also indicate whether proposals are acceptable or 
unacceptable, and/or whether the offerors' responses to individual 
criteria are acceptable or unacceptable.

                                     contains deficiencies and/or       
                                     weaknesses that can be corrected   
                                     only by major or significant

                                     that there are widespread          
                                     information gaps. In addition,     
                                     because of the deficiencies,       
                                     weaknesses, and/or information     
                                     gaps, serious concerns exist on the
                                     part of the TEP about the offeror's
                                     ability to perform the required    
                                     work.                              
2.................................  Information related to the factor is
                                     incomplete, unclear, or indicates  
                                     an inadequate approach to, or      
                                     understanding of the factor. The   
                                     TEP believes there is question as  
                                     to whether the offeror would be    
                                     able to perform satisfactorily.    
3.................................  The response to the factor is       
                                     adequate. Overall, it meets the    
                                     specifications and requirements,   
                                     such that the TEP believes that the
                                     offeror could perform to meet the  
                                     Government's minimum requirements. 
4.................................  The response to the factor is good  
                                     with some superior features.       
                                     Information provided is generally  
                                     clear, and the approach is         
                                     acceptable with the possibility of 
                                     more than adequate performance.    
5.................................  The response to the factor is       
                                     superior in most features.         
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Ranking. The use of pre-established cut-off scores to determine 
the competitive range or the source to be selected is prohibited. Each 
member of the TEP shall independently evaluate and score each offer. The 
TEP shall develop a consensus opinion on the scores assigned to each 
offer. The averaging of individual TEP members' scores to arrive at an 
overall panel score is prohibited.
    (3) The goal of the technical evaluation is to understand each 
offeror's proposal and to assess each proposal relative to the specified 
evaluation factors. The TEP report(s) should address any perceived 
strengths, as well as any perceived weaknesses or deficiencies, and 
risks associated with the offerors' performance. Scores may or may not 
change from the initial evaluation to the supplemental evaluation, 
depending on the offerors' response to interrogatories. The supplemental 
TEP report must explain the rationale for no change in score, as well as 
any decrease or increase in score as a result of the offerors' response 
to interrogatories.
    (b) Technical evaluation panel report of initial offers. The TEP 
shall deliver their report to the Contracting Officer upon completion of 
the evaluation of initial offers.
    (1) The TEP report shall include: (i) A detailed scoring of each 
offer received and a narrative summary of facts and findings of 
significant strengths, weaknesses, and risks associated with each offer. 
The narrative summary and the score must be consistent. Score sheets 
prepared by each individual panel member must be made available upon the 
Contracting Officer's request. For contracts valued at $500,000 or less, 
the Chairperson of the TEP may use the short form technical evaluation 
format (EPA Form 1900-61); and
    (ii) Any interrogatories the Contracting Officer should submit to 
offerors to clarify their technical proposals to address any weaknesses, 
deficiencies, or questions associated with their technical proposals. 
The Contracting Officer may review the technical proposals and TEP 
evaluation, and submit any additional interrogatories deemed 
appropriate.
    (2)(i) A statement that the respective technical evaluation panel 
members are free from actual or potential personal conflicts of 
interest, and are in compliance with the Office of Government Ethics 
ethics provisions at 5 CFR Part 2635.
    (ii) Any information which might reveal that a offeror has an actual 
or potential organizational conflict of interest.
    (3) The Contracting Officer may release the cost/price proposals to 
the entire TEP or solely to the TEP Chairperson, after the TEP has 
completed its evaluation of initial proposals. The TEP or Chairperson 
should evaluate cost/price proposals to determine

[[Page 25]]

whether the offerors' cost/price proposals adequately reflect their 
technical proposals and the requirements of the solicitation, and 
demonstrate that the proposed price or cost provides an adequate 
understanding of the requirements of the solicitation. Any 
inconsistencies between the proposals and the solicitation requirements 
should be identified. Any inconsistencies between the cost and technical 
proposals should also be identified.
    (c) Safeguarding information. The following procedures are 
prescribed for protecting source selection information.
    (1) Offerors' identities, offer contents, and prices shall be 
treated with the utmost discretion to avoid compromising the evaluation 
results or giving any offeror an unfair competitive advantage. Any 
questions regarding the receipt and distribution of offers, status of 
the proceedings, or other matters shall be referred to the Contracting 
Officer or designated contract specialist.
    (2) After receipt of proposals, the contract specialist shall 
serially number all proposal copies received, distribute the required 
number of proposal copies to the TEP and BEP, and be responsible for the 
collection and final disposal of proposal copies. The panel chairpersons 
shall maintain a log of proposal distribution within the TEP and BEP. 
The contract specialist shall destroy all excess copies of proposals in 
a timely manner. The original copy of each unsuccessful proposal should 
be retained by the contract specialist as a reference in conducting 
debriefings. A minimum of two copies of the successful proposal should 
be retained (contract file copy/Project Officer file copy) for reference 
in administering the contract. Final disposition of the file shall be 
accomplished in accordance with FAR subpart 4.8, and the EPA ``Records 
Management Manual.''
    (d) Rejection of proposals. The Competition Advocate is authorized 
to make the determination in FAR 15.608(b).

<R05>
1515.609  Competitive range.

    (a) The Contracting Officer shall prepare the determination of the 
competitive range for the subsequent approval of the SSO only if the 
determination is tantamount to selection, for example when there is only 
a single offeror in the competitive range or when there are only two 
proposals in the competitive range and multiple awards are anticipated. 
All determinations must be completely documented to support the 
competitive range decision.
    (b)(1) When there is only one proposal in the competitive range, the 
Contracting Officer shall examine the solicitation to determine if it 
was unduly restrictive. As part of the discussion in the competitive 
range determination, the Contracting Officer shall address at a minimum, 
the following four factors: whether the requirement could have been 
broken up into smaller components; whether the solicitation provided 
adequate response time; whether the requirement could have been 
satisfied with reduced staffing levels (discussion may be combined with 
the first factor); and if applicable, whether the work required on-site 
could otherwise be performed at a contractor's facility, avoiding the 
cost and logistical implications of relocating employees. If it is 
determined that unduly restrictive requirements inhibited competition, 
the Contracting Officer shall consider appropriate changes to those 
requirements and cancellation and reissuance of the solicitation.
    (2) In cases where only a single proposal has been received and a 
competitive range determination has not been prepared, the discussion of 
the reasons for receipt of the single proposal which otherwise would be 
contained in the competitive range determination shall be included in 
the source selection document. The discussion in the source selection 
document at a minimum shall address the factors referenced in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section. If it is determined that unduly restrictive 
requirements inhibited competition, the Contracting Officer shall 
consider appropriate changes to those requirements and cancellation and 
reissuance of the solicitation.
    (3) The Contracting Officer shall provide a copy of the competitive 
range

[[Page 26]]

determination or source selection document to the Competition Advocate 
after approval of the determination or document by the designated Source 
Selection Official.

1515.612  Formal source selection.

    (a) Responsibilities for evaluation and selection. The Source 
Selection Official (SSO) shall appoint the SEB, TEP, members prior to 
issuance of the solicitation to allow the members to participate in the 
development and review of the solicitation document. Appointments should 
be recommended in the source selection plan prepared by the Contracting 
Officer in accordance with FAR 15.612(c). Individuals involved in the 
evaluation and selection process shall be at the levels specified below.
    (1) Acquisitions having a potential value exceeding $15,000,000 
($25,000,000 for ADP and Superfund):
    (i) SSO--CCO
    (ii) SEB Chairperson--Branch Chief or as otherwise designated by the 
CCO.
    (iii) SEB Membership--The SSO will determine the organizational 
levels of the individuals to serve on the SEB.
    (iv) TEP Chairperson--The SSO will determine, based on the 
recommendation of the requesting program office, the Chairperson of the 
TEP. For recompetes or follow-on contracts, the Chairperson should 
normally not be the incumbent contract's Project Officer.
    (v) TEP Membership--At least two members, in addition to the Project 
Officer, who are knowledgeable of the procurement's technical aspects. 
If the procurement is a follow-on to an existing contract, at least one 
of the TEP members should be someone who is not involved in managing the 
current contract, preferably from outside of the program division which 
originated the requirement. See 1515.604(a) for waiver of this 
requirement.
    (2) Acquisitions having a potential value exceeding $5,000,000 to 
$25,000,000:
    (i) SSO--To be determined by the Chief of the Contracting Office, 
unless otherwise restricted in his/her delegation of procurement 
authority.
    (ii) SEB--An SEB need be established only when requested by the 
program office or determined necessary by the SSO. The SSO shall 
determine the organizational levels of the individuals to serve on the 
SEB.
    (iii) TEP chairpersons and memberships shall be constituted as in 
paragraph (a)(1) (iv) and (v) of this section.
    (3) Acquisitions having a potential value of $5,000,000 or less:
    (i) SSO--The CO.
    (ii) SEB--An SEB may be established only when requested by the 
program office or determined necessary by the SSO. The SSO shall 
determine the organizational levels of the individuals to serve on the 
SEB.
    (iii.) TEP--chairpersons and memberships shall be constituted as in 
paragraph (a)(1) (iv) and (v) of this section. At the request of the 
program office, it may only be the PO.
    (b) Source selection decision--(1) Source Evaluation Board Report. 
In procurements where an SEB is convened, the SEB shall provide the SSO 
with a report on its findings. The report shall be submitted after 
completion of discussions or full negotiations, depending on the source 
selection method employed, and shall include:
    (i) A description of the acquisition;
    (ii) A summary of the significant strengths, weaknesses, and risks 
associated with each offer still in the competitive range. This summary 
shall generally be an independent assessment of the facts and findings 
appearing in the TEP and BEP reports. The SEB report contains 
recommendations for selection; and
    (iii) A statement that the SEB members are free from actual or 
potential personal conflicts of interest.
    (2) Source selection. (i) The Contracting Officer shall prepare the 
source selection decision for the SSO's subsequent approval. The 
decision shall document the consideration given to price or cost, 
technical merit, and other factors contained in the solicitation. These 
other factors (e.g., record of prior performance, the offeror's 
subcontracting plan, etc.) may be used as the unscored discriminating 
elements for determining the selection of a

[[Page 27]]

source between two otherwise substantially equal offers from both a cost 
and technical standpoint.
    (ii) The SEB report to the SSO may serve as the source selection 
decision provided the recommendation of the SEB is accepted by the SSO 
and the SEB report includes the information required by 
1515.612(b)(2)(i).
    (c) Source Selection Plan. The CO must describe the scoring system 
to be used in evaluating the proposals if the numerical scoring system 
described at 1515.608(a)(1) is not used.

<R05>
1515.900  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart implements FAR subpart 15.9 and prescribes the EPA 
structured approach for determining profit or fee prenegotiation 
objectives.


<R05>
1515.902  Policy.

    (a) EPA structured approach. FAR 15.902 requires that agencies use a 
structured approach for determining the profit or fee objective in those 
acquisitions that require cost analysis. The structured approach 
prescribed in 1515.970 shall be used by EPA Contracting Officers in 
developing a prenegotiation profit or fee objective except as provided 
in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The purpose of the structured 
approach is:
    (1) To provide a standard method of evaluation;
    (2) To ensure consideration of all relative factors;
    (3) To provide a basis for documentation and explanation of the 
profit negotiation objective;
    (4) To allow Contractors to earn profits commensurate with the 
assumption of risk;
    (5) To reward Contractors who provide their own facilities, 
financing and personnel; and
    (6) To reward Contractors who undertake more difficult work 
requiring higher risks.
    (b)(1) Other methods. Contracting Officers may use methods other 
than those prescibed in 1515.970 for estabishing profit or fee 
objectives under the following circumstances.
    (i) Architect-engineering contracts;
    (ii) Personal or professional service contracts;
    (iii) Management contracts, e.g., for maintenance or operation of 
Government facilities;
    (iv) Termination settlements;
    (v) Engineering services, labor-hour, time and materials contracts 
which provide for payment on a man-hour, man-day, or man-month basis, 
and where the contribution by the Contractor constitutes the furnishing 
of personnel rather than the output of an integrated research, 
engineering, or manufacturing operation;
    (vi) Construction contracts; and
    (vii) Cost-plus-award-fee contracts.
    (2) Generally, it is expected that such methods will:
    (i) Provide the Contracting Officer with a technique that will 
ensure consideration of the relative value of the appropriate profit 
factors described under ``Profit Factors,'' and
    (ii) Serve as a basis for documentation of the objective.
    (c) Under unusual circumstances, the CCO may specifically waive the 
requirement for the use of the guidelines. Such exceptions shall be 
justified in writing and authorized only in situations where the 
guidelines method is determined to be unsuitable.
    (d) Limitations. In the event that any of the methods used would 
result in establishing a fee objective in violation of limitations 
established by statute (see FAR 15.903(d), the maximum fee objective 
shall be the percentage allowed pursuant to such limitations. No 
administrative ceilings on profits or fees shall be established.

<R05>
1515.905  Profit-anaylsis factors.

    Profit-analysis factors prescribed in the EPA structured approach in 
analyzing profit or fee include those prescribed by FAR 15.905-1 and 
additional factors authorized by FAR 15.905-2 to foster achievement of 
program objectives. These profit or fee factors are prescribed in 
1515.970-2.


<R05>
1515.970  EPA structured approach for developing profit or fee objectives.


<R05>
1515.970-1  General.

    (a) It is the policy of the Agency to utilize profit to attract 
Contractors who possess talents and skills necessary to the 
accomplishment of the objectives of the EPA and to stimulate efficient 
contract performance. In negotiating profit/fee, it is necessary that 
all relative factors be considered, and that fair and reasonable amounts 
be negotiated which give the Contractor a profit objective commensurate 
with the nature of the work to be done, the Contractor's input to the 
total performance, and the risks assumed by the Contractor.
    (b) To properly reflect differences among contracts and the 
circumstances relating thereto and to select an appropriate relative 
profit/fee in consideration of these differences and circumstances, 
weightings have been developed for application by the Contracting 
Officer to standard measurement bases representative of the prescribed 
profit factors cited in FAR 15.905 and paragraph 1515.970-2(a)(1). Each 
profit factor or subfactor, or component thereof, has been assigned 
weights relative to their value to the contract's overall effort and the 
range of weights to be applied to each profit factor.


<R05>
1515.970-2  EPA structured system.

    (a)(1) Profit factors. The factors set forth below and the weighted 
ranges listed after each factor shall be used in all instances where the 
profit is to be specifically negotiated.

  Extent of investment

  Inventive and developmental contributions

  Effect of competition                                                 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) The Contracting Officer shall first measure the ``Contractor's 
Input to Total Performance'' by the assignment of a profit percentage 
within the designated weight ranges to each element of contract cost 
recognized by the Contracting Officer. Such costs are multiplied by the 
specific percentages to arrive at specific dollar profits. The amount 
calculated for facilities capital cost of money shall not be included as 
part of the cost base for the computation of profit or fee. A complete 
discussion of how facilities capital cost of money is determined and how 
it is applied and administered is set forth in FAR 31.205-10.
    (3) After computing a total dollar profit for the Contractor's Input 
to Total Performance, the Contracting Officer shall calculate the 
specific profit dollars assigned for cost risk and performance. This is 
accomplished by multiplying the total Government cost objective, 
exclusive of any facilities capital cost of money, by the specific 
weight assigned to cost risk and performance. The Contracting Officer 
shall then determine the profit or fee objective by adding the total 
profit dollars for the Contractor's Input to Total Performance to the 
specific dollar profits assigned to cost risk and performance. The 
profit or fee objective shall then be reduced by an amount equal to the 
amount of facilities capital cost of money allowed.

[[Page 29]]

EPA Form 1900-2 shall be used to facilitate the calculation of this 
profit or fee objective.
    (4) The weight factors shown are designed for arriving at profit or 
fee objectives for other than nonprofit and not-for-profit 
organizations. Adjustments as explained below are to be made to reflect 
differences between profit and nonprofit organizations.
    (i) For purposes of this subparagraph, nonprofit and not-for-profit 
organizations are defined as those business entities organized and 
operated exclusively for charitable, scientific or educational purposes, 
no part of the net earnings of which inure to the benefit of any private 
shareholder or individual, no substantial part of the activities of 
which is carrying on propaganda or otherwise attempting to influence 
legislation or participating in any political campaign on behalf of any 
candidate for public office, and which are exempt from Federal income 
taxation under section 51 of the Internal Revenue Code.
    (ii) For contracts with nonprofit and not-for-profit organizations 
where fees are involved, the following adjustments are required:
    (A) A special factor of -3 percent shall be assigned in all cases.
    (B) The weighted ranges from ``Record of Contractor's Performance'' 
shall be halved, i.e., -1 percent to +1 percent rather than -2 percent 
to +2 percent.
    (b) Assignment of values to specific factors--(1) General. In making 
his/her judgment of the value of each factor, the Contracting Officer 
should be governed by the definition, description, and purpose of the 
factors together with considerations for evaluating them as set forth 
herein.
    (2) Contractor's input to total performance. This factor is a 
measure of how much the Contractor itself is expected to contribute to 
the overall effort necessary to meet the contract performance 
requirements in an efficient manner. This factor, which is apart from 
the Contractor's responsibility for contract performance, takes into 
account what resources are necessary and what the Contractor itself must 
do to accomplish a conversion of ideas and materials into the final item 
called for in the contract. This is a recognition that within a given 
performance output, or within a given sales dollar figure, necessary 
efforts on the part of individual contractors can vary widely in both 
value and quantity, and that the profit objective should reflect the 
extent and nature of the Contractor's contribution to total performance. 
Greater profit opportunity should be provided under contracts requiring 
a high degree of professional and managerial skill and to prospective 
contractors whose skills, facilities, and technical assets can be 
expected to lead to efficient and economical contract performance. The 
evaluation of this factor requires an analysis of the cost content of 
the proposed contract as follows:
    (i) Direct materials (purchased parts, subcontracted items, and 
other material). Analysis of these cost items shall include an 
evaluation of the managerial and technical effort necessary to obtain 
the required purchased parts, subcontracted items, and other materials. 
This evaluation shall include consideration of the number of orders and 
suppliers, and whether established sources are available or new sources 
must be developed. The Contracting Officer shall also determine whether 
the Contractor will, for example, obtain the materials by routine orders 
or readily available supplies (particularly those of substantial value 
in relation to the total contract costs), or by detailed subcontracts 
for which the prime Contractor will be required to develop complex 
specifications involving creative design or close tolerance 
manufacturing requirements. Consideration should be given to the 
managerial and technical efforts necessary for the prime Contractor to 
administer subcontracts, and select subcontractors, including efforts to 
break out subcontracts from sole sources, through the introduction of 
competition. These determinations should be made for purchases of raw 
materials or basic commodities, purchases of processed material 
including all types of components of standard or near-standard 
characteristics, and purchases of pieces, assemblies, subassemblies, 
special tooling, and other products special to the end-item. In the 
application of this criterion, it should be recognized that the

[[Page 30]]

contribution of the prime Contractor to its purchasing program might be 
substantial. This might be applicable in the management of 
subcontracting programs involving many sources, involving new complex 
components and instrumentation, incomplete specifications, and close 
surveillance by the prime Contractor's representative. Recognized costs 
proposed as direct material cost such as scrap charges shall be treated 
as material for profit evaluation. If intracompany transfers are 
accepted at price, in accordance with FAR 31.205-26(e), they should be 
excluded from the fee computation. Other intracompany transfers shall be 
evaluated by individual components of cost, i.e., material, labor, and 
overhead. Normally, the lowest weight for direct material is 2 percent. 
A weighting of less than 2 percent and would be appropriate only in 
unusual circumstances when there is a minimal contribution by the 
Contractor in relation to the total cost of the material.
    (ii) Equipment. It is the policy of the Agency to contract with 
individuals or firms who have special capabilities relative to the needs 
of the EPA. These capabilities include personnel with particular skills, 
or talents, and facilities (plant and equipment) necessary to complete 
the contract objectives. For the purpose of profit/fee analysis, 
equipment includes purchased items which are not to be an integral part 
of the final product. It would generally consist of production or test 
equipment. Where the EPA has to provide equipment to be Contractor 
either as Government-furnished equipment or Contractor-acquired 
equipment, appropriate profit/fee adjustments are necessary. Generally, 
a low weight range shall be assigned to the cost of such equipment (1 to 
2 percent).
    (iii) Engineering labor and manufactuirng labor. Analysis of the 
engineering labor and manufacturing labor items of the cost content of 
the contract should include evaluation of the comparative quality and 
level of the engineering talents, manufacturing skills, and experience 
to be employed. In evaluating engineering labor for the purpose of 
assigning profit dollars, consideration should be given to the amount of 
notable scientific talent or unusual or scarce engineering talent needed 
in contrast to journeyman engineering effort or supporting personnel. 
The diversity, or lack thereof, of scientific and engineering 
specialties required for contract performance and the corresponding need 
for engineering supervision and coordination should be evaluated. 
Similarly, the variety of manufacturing labor skills required and the 
Contractor's manpower resources for meeting these requirements should be 
considered. For the purpose of profit/fee computation, manufacturing 
labor includes all nonprofessional labor, e.g., secretaries, technicians 
and carpenters, etc.
    (iv) Engineering overhead, manufacturing overhead, and general and 
administrative expenses. (A) Where practicable, analysis of these 
overhead items of costs should include the evaluation of the make up of 
the expenses and how much they contribute to contract performance. This 
analysis should include a determination of the amount of labor within 
these overhead pools and how this labor would be treated if it were 
considered as direct labor under the contract. The allocable labor 
elements should be given the same profit consideration that they would 
receive if they were treated as direct labor. The other elements of 
these overhead pools should be evaluated to determine whether they are 
routine expenses such as utilities, depreciation, and maintenance, and 
hence given lesser profit consideration given the pools as a whole.
    (B) It is not necessary that the Contractor's accounting system 
break down its overhead expenses within the classification of 
engineering overhead, manufacturing overhead, and general and 
administrative expenses. The Contractor whose accounting system only 
reflects one overhead rate on all direct labor need not change its 
system to correspond with all the above classifications. Where 
practicable, the Contracting Officer in his/her evaluation of such a 
Contractor's overhead rate should break out the applicable sections of 
the composite rate which could be classified as engineering overhead, 
manufacturing overhead, and general and administrative expenses and 
follow the appropriate evaluation technique.

[[Page 31]]

When it is not practicable to evaluate the elements of the burden pool, 
the following rates should usually apply:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 Percent
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Engineering overhead..........................................       7.5
Manufacturing overhead........................................       5.5
Composite overhead............................................       6.5
G&A...........................................................       6.5
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (C) It is not necessary for the Contracting Officer to make a 
separate profit evaluation of overhead expenses in connection with each 
procurement action for substantially the same product with the same 
contractor. Once an analysis of the profit weight to be assigned the 
overhead pool has been made, the weight assigned may be used for future 
procurements with the same contractor until there is a change in the 
cost composition of the overhead pool or the contract circumstances.
    (v) Consultants. Consultant costs, whether related to an individual 
consultant or consulting firm should be analyzed from the standpoint of 
what talents and skills the consultants have and how they will be used 
on the contract. The analysis should consider if the Contractor normally 
should be expected to have people with comparable expertise employed as 
full-time staff or if the contract requires skills not normally 
available on an employer-employee relationship. Where the Contractor is 
using consultants to perform services which could normally be expected 
to be done in-house, the rating factor should be generally below 2 to 3 
percent. Where noted experts are retained for consultation on the 
contract, the rating will generally be higher.
    (vi) Other direct costs. Items of costs, such as travel, 
subsistence, printing, and computers should generally be assigned a 
rating of 1 to 3 percent. The analysis of these costs should be similar 
to the analysis of direct materials.
    (3) Contractor's assumption of contract cost risk. (i) It is the 
policy of the Administration to shift the risk of contract costs to the 
fullest extent practicable to contractors and to compensate them for the 
assumption of this risk. Evaluation of this risk requires a 
determination of:
    (A) The degree of cost responsibility the Contractor assumes, (B) 
the reliability of the cost estimates in relation to the task assumed, 
and (C) the chance of the Contractor's success or failure. This factor 
is specially limited to the risk of contract costs. Thus, such risks of 
losing potential profits in other fields are not within the scope of 
this factor.
    (ii) The first and basic determination of the degree of cost 
responsibility assumed by the Contractor is related to the sharing of 
total risk of contract cost by the Government and the Contractor through 
the selection of contract type. The extremes are a cost-plus-fixed-fee 
contract requiring only that the Contractor use its best efforts to 
perform a task, and a firm-fixed-price contract for a complex item. Such 
cost-plus-fixed-fee contract would reflect a minimum assumption of cost 
responsibility, whereas such firm-fixed-price contract would reflect a 
complete assumption of cost responsibility. Therefore, in the first step 
of determining what value is to be given for the Contractor's assumption 
of contract cost risk, a zero rating shall be given to a proposed cost-
plus-fixed-fee best efforts contract, and a higher rating shall be given 
to a closely priced firm-fixed-price contract for a new, complex item.
    (iii) The second determination is that of the reliability of the 
cost estimates. Sound price negotiation requires well-defined contract 
objectives and reliable cost estimates. An excessive cost estimate 
reduces the possibility that the cost of performance will exceed the 
contract price, thereby reducing the Contractor's assumption of contract 
cost risk.
    (iv) The third determination is that of the difficulty of the 
Contractor's task. The Contractor's task can be difficult or easy, 
regardless of the type of contract.
    (v) Contractors are likely to assume greater cost risks only if the 
Contracting Officers objectively analyze the risk incident to proposed 
contracts and are willing to compensate Contractors for it. Generally, a 
cost-plus-fixed-fee contract would not justify a reward for risk in 
excess of 1 percent, nor would a firm-fixed-price contract justify a 
reward of less than 4 percent. Where proper contract type selection has 
been

[[Page 32]]

made, the reward for risk by contract type would usually fall into the 
following percentages ranges:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
              Type of contract                    Percentage ranges     
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cost-plus-fixed-fee........................  0 to 1.                    
Cost-plus-incentive-fee including cost       1 to 2.                    
 incentives only.                                                       
Cost-plus-incentive-fee including cost,      2\1/2\ to 3.               
 performance, and delivery incentives.                                  
Fixed-price-incentive including cost         2 to 4.                    
 incentives only.                                                       
Fixed-price-incentive including cost,        3 to 5.                    
 performance, and delivery incentives.                                  
Prospective price determination............  4 to 5.                    
Firm-fixed-price...........................  4 to 6.                    
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (A) These ranges may not be appropriate for all procurement 
situations. For instance, a fixed-price-incentive contract which is 
closely priced with a low ceiling price and a high incentive share may 
be tantamount to a firm-fixed-price contract. In this situation, the 
Contracting Officer might determine that a basis exists for high 
confidence in the reasonableness of the estimate, and that little 
opportunity exists for cost reduction without extraordinary efforts. The 
Contractor's willingness to accept ceilings on their burden rates should 
be considered as a risk factor for cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts.
    (B) In making a contract cost risk evaluation in a procurement 
action that involves definitization of a letter contract, consideration 
should be given to the effect on total contract cost risk as a result of 
having partial performance under a letter contract. Under some 
circumstances, it may be reasoned that the total amount of cost risk has 
been effectively reduced by the existence of a letter contract. Under 
other circumstances, it may be apparent that the Contractor's cost risk 
remained substantially as great as though a letter contract had not been 
used. Where a Contractor has begun work under an anticipatory cost 
letter, the risk assumed is greater than the normal situation. To be 
equitable the determination of a profit weight for application to the 
total of all recognized costs, both those incurred and those yet to be 
expended, must be made with consideration to all attendant 
circumstances, not just to the portion of costs incurred or percentages 
of work completed, prior to definitization.
    (4) Record of contract performance. (i) The purpose of this factor 
is to motivate Contractors to improve their performance by rewarding 
them for excellent past performance and penalizing them for poor 
performance. Effective use of this factor requires that: (A) Reports on 
the various aspects of past performance be obtained and evaluated; and 
(B) this information be used in such a way as to motivate Contractors to 
improve their performance.
    (ii) The evaluation of a particular Contractor's past performance 
and the importance placed upon the various subfactors listed below 
should be done in such a way as to motivate the Contractor to improve 
its performance. For instance, it might be pointless, in evaluating the 
performance of an autonomous division of a multidivisional contractor, 
to place emphasis on the performance of another autonomous division. 
Under such circumstances, the management of the division being evaluated 
might have no means of controlling the performance of the other 
division; therefore, emphasis on this performance by assigning a plus or 
minus rating to this factor might have a negative effect upon motivation 
to improve.
    (iii) The weight to be assigned to this factor is arrived at on a 
judgment basis rather than an arithmetical averaging of weights assigned 
to all factors, depending upon the particular procurement situation, and 
the relative importance of the various factors. For example, an 
evaluation of a particular Contractor may indicate that its performance 
was satisfactory in most areas, except that it showed a preference for 
doing all work in-house and a disinclination to support Government small 
business objectives. In such a case the Contracting Officer may feel 
that the importance of these factors might justify the assignment of a 
lower overall rating for the record of past performance.
    (iv) As stated above, the purpose of this factor is to reward a 
Contractor for excellent past performance and penalize it for poor 
performance. Therefore, performance which is rated as merely 
satisfactory should generally be assigned a weight of zero. However, a 
Contractor who has consistently met

[[Page 33]]

contractual requirements may be awarded a plus.
    (v) The following factors are to be considered in evaluating a 
Contractor's performance record:
    (A) Cost efficiency. Low cost performance reflecting economic use of 
facilities and manpower, sound purchasing methods and subcontracting 
procedures, and effective inventory control are criteria for 
consideration. Improvement in efficiency through investment in plant 
modernization, past efficiencies, or lack thereof, effectiveness of the 
Contractor's make-or-buy program, purchasing and subcontracting system 
and inventory control should be evaluated.
    (B) Management. Stability and competence of managment personnel, 
their willingness and ability to adjust company resources to meet 
peculiarly difficult and changing control requirements are criteria for 
consideration. The degree of cooperation by the Contractor with the 
objectives of the Government should be considered.
    (C) Extent of the contractor's investment. The extent of a 
Contractor's total investment (i.e., both equity and borrowed capital) 
in the performance of the contract will be taken into consideration in 
determining the amount of the fee or profits.
    (D) Reliability of cost estimates. Accuracy and reliability of 
previous cost estimates should be considered. Where substantial overruns 
have occurred, the Contracting Officer should attempt to determine the 
reasons.
    (E) Inventive and developmental contributions. Extent and nature of 
Contractor-initiated and financed research, development, design work, 
product engineering, quality control, and manufacturing processes and 
techniques in the areas of concern to the EPA should be analyzed.
    (F) Timely performance. The Contractor's performance record, 
considering excusable delays and the Contractor's efforts to overcome 
delays, should be analyzed.
    (G) Small business participation. The Contractor's policies and 
procedures which energetically support Government small business 
programs pursuant to FAR subpart 19.7 should be given favorable 
consideration. Any unusual effort which the Contractor displays in 
subscontracting with small concerns, particularly for development type 
work likely to result in later production opportunities, and overall 
effectiveness of the Contractor in subcontracting with and furnishing 
assistance to small concerns should be considered. Conversely, failure 
or unwillingness on the part of the Contractor to support Government 
small business policies should be viewed as evidence of poor performance 
for the purpose of establishing a profit objective.
    (H) Labor surplus area participation. A similar review and 
evaluation (as required in paragraph (b)(4)(v)(G) of this section) 
should be given to the Contractor's policies and procedures supporting 
the Government's labor surplus area program pursuant to FAR part 20. 
Particular favorable consideration should be given to a Contractor who: 
(1) Makes a significant effort to help find jobs and provide training 
for the hardcore unemployed, or (2) promotes maximum subcontractor 
utilization of certified-eligible concerns, as defined in FAR 20.101.
    (I) Extent of Government assistance. The Government encourages its 
Contractors to perform their contracts with the minimum of financial, 
facilities, or other assistance from the Government. Where extraordinary 
financial, facilities, or other assistance must be furnished to a 
Contractor by the Government, such extraordinary assistance should have 
a modifying effect in determining what constitutes a fair and reasonable 
profit or fee.
    (J) Effect of competition. When competition is effective and 
proposals are on a firm-fixed-price basis, the Contracting Officer 
normally need not consider in detail the amount of estimated profit 
included in a price. When effective competition is lacking, and in all 
cases where cost analysis is performed in accordance with FAR subpart 
15.8, the estimate for profit, target profit or fee, or the proposed 
fixed fee should be analyzed in the same manner as all other elements of 
price.

<R05>
1515.970-3  Documentation.

    Determination of the profit or fee objective, in accordance with 
this subpart shall be fully documented. Since the profit objective is 
the Contracting Officer's pre-negotiation evaluation of a total profit 
allowance for the proposed contract, the amounts developed for each 
category of cost will probably change in the course of negotiation. 
Furthermore, the negotiated profit will probably vary from the profit 
objective and from the prenegotiation detailed application of the 
weights to each element of the Contractor's input to total performance. 
Since the profit objective is viewed as a whole rather than as its 
component parts, insignificant variations from the prenegotiation profit 
objective, as a result of changes to the Contractor's input to total 
performance, need not be documented in detail. Conversely, significant 
deviations from the profit objective necessary to reach a final 
agreement on profit or fee shall be explained in the record of 
negotiation prepared in accordance with FAR 15.808.

<R04>
              Subpart 1516.3--Cost-Reimbursement Contracts


<R05>
1516.301-70  Payment of fee.

    The policy of EPA for cost-reimbursement, term form contracts is to 
make provisional payment of fee (i.e. the fixed fee on cost-plus-fixed-
fee type contracts or the base fee on cost-plus-award-fee type 
contracts) on a percentage of work completed basis, when such a method 
will not prove detrimental to proper contract performance. Percentage of 
work completed is the ratio of the direct labor hours performed in 
relation to the direct labor hours set forth in the contract in clause 
1552.212-70, ``Level of Effort--Cost Reimbursement Term Contract.'' 
Provisional payment of fee will remain subject to withholding 
provisions, such as 48 CFR 52.216-8, Fixed Fee.
[56 FR 43711, Sept. 4, 1991]


<R05>
1516.303  Cost-sharing contracts.


<R05>
1516.303-71  Definition.

    Cost-sharing is a generic term denoting any situation where the 
Government does not fully reimburse a contractor for all allowable costs 
necessary to accomplish the project under the contract. This term 
encompasses cost-matching and cost-limitations, in addition to cost-
sharing. Cost-sharing does not include usual contractual limitations 
such as indirect cost ceilings in accordance with FAR 42.707, or 
ceilings on travel or other direct costs. Cost-sharing contracts may be 
required as a result of Congressional mandate.
[61 FR 14504, Apr. 2, 1996]

[[Page 35]]


<R05>
1516.303-72  Policy.

    (a) The Agency shall use cost-sharing contracts where the principal 
purpose is ultimate commercialization and utilization of technologies by 
the private sector. There should also be a reasonable expectation of 
future economic benefits for the contractor and the Government beyond 
the Government's contract.
    (b) Cost-sharing may be accomplished by a contribution to either 
direct or indirect costs, provided such costs are reasonable, allocable 
and allowable in accordance with the cost principles of the contract. 
Allowable costs which are absorbed by the contractor as its share of 
contract costs may not be charged directly or indirectly to the Agency 
or the Federal Government.
    (c) Unsolicited proposals will be considered on a case-by-case basis 
by the Contracting Officer as to the appropriateness of cost-sharing.
[61 FR 14504, Apr. 2, 1996]


<R05>
1516.303-73  Types of cost-sharing.

    (a) Cost-sharing may be accomplished in various forms or 
combinations. These include, but are not limited to: cash outlays, real 
property or interest therein, personal property or services, cost 
matching, or other in-kind contributions.
    (b) In-kind contributions represent non-cash contributions provided 
by the performing contractor which would normally be a charge against 
the contract. While in-kind contributions are an acceptable method of 
cost-sharing, should the booked costs of property appear unrealistic, 
the fair market value of the property shall be determined pursuant to 
1516.303-74 of this chapter.
    (c) In-kind contributions may be in the form of personal property 
(equipment or supplies) or services which are directly beneficial, 
specifically identifiable and necessary for the performance of the 
contract. In-kind contributions must meet all of the following criteria 
before acceptance.
    (1) Be verifiable from the contractor's books and records;
    (2) Not be included as contributions under any other Federal 
contract;
    (3) Be necessary to accomplish project objectives;
    (4) Provide for types of charges that would otherwise be allowable 
under applicable Federal cost principles appropriate to the contractor's 
organization; and
    (5) Not be paid for by the Federal Government under any contract, 
agreement or grant.
[61 FR 14504, Apr. 2, 1996]


<R05>
1516.303-74  Determining the value of in-kind contributions.

    In-kind contributions accepted from a contractor will be addressed 
on a case-by-case basis provided the established values do not exceed 
fair market values.
    (a) Where the Agency receives title to donated land, building, 
equipment or supplies and the property is not fully consumed during 
performance of the contract, the Contracting Officer should establish 
the property's value based on the contractor's booked costs (i.e., 
acquisition cost less depreciation, if any) at the time of donation. If 
the booked costs reflect unrealistic values when compared to current 
market conditions, the Contracting Officer may establish another 
appropriate value if supported by an independent appraisal of the fair 
market value of the donated property or property in similar condition 
and circumstances.
    (b) The Contracting Officer will monitor reports of in-kind costs as 
they are incurred or recognized during the contract period of 
performance to determine that the value of in-kind services does not 
exceed fair market values.
    (c) The value of any services or the use of personal or real 
property donated by a contractor should be established when necessary in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting policies and Federal cost 
principles.
[61 FR 14505, Apr. 2, 1996]


<R05>
1516.303-75  Amount of cost-sharing.

    (a) Contractors should contribute a reasonable amount of the total 
project cost covered under the contract. The ratio of cost participation 
should correlate to the apparent advantages

[[Page 36]]

available to performers and the proximity of implementing 
commercialization, i.e., the higher the potential for future profits, 
the higher the contractor's share should be.
    (b) Fee will not be paid to the contractor or any member of the 
contractor team (subcontractors and consultants) which has a substantial 
and direct interest in the contract, or is in a position to gain long 
term benefits from the contract. A vulnerability the Contracting Officer 
should consider in reviewing a prime contractor's request for consent to 
subcontract is whether subcontractors under prime cost-sharing contracts 
have a significant direct interest in the contract to gain long-term 
benefits from the contract.
    (c) The Contracting Officer, with the input of technical experts, 
may consider the following factors in determining reasonable levels of 
cost sharing:
    (1) The availability of the technology to competitors;
    (2) Improvements in the contractor's market share position;
    (3) The time and risk necessary to achieve success;
    (4) If the results of the project involve patent rights which could 
be sold or licensed;
    (5) If the contractor has non-Federal sources of funds to include as 
cost participation; and
    (6) If the contractor has the production and other capabilities to 
capitalize the results of the project.
    (d) A contractor's cost participation can be provided by other 
subcontractors with which it has contractual arrangements to perform the 
contract as long as the contractor's cost-sharing goal is met.
[61 FR 14505, Apr. 2, 1996]


<R05>
1516.303-76  Fee on cost-sharing contracts by subcontractors.

    (a) Subcontractors under prime cost-sharing contracts who do not 
have a significant direct interest in the contract or who are not in a 
position to gain long-term benefits from the contract may earn a fee.
    (b) Contracting Officers should be alert to a potential 
vulnerability for the Government under cost-sharing contracts when 
evaluating proposed subcontractors or consenting to a subcontract during 
contract administration, where the subcontractor is a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of the prime. The vulnerability consists of the subsidiary 
earning a large amount of fee, which could be returned to the prime 
through stock dividends or other intercompany transactions. This could 
circumvent the objective of a cost-sharing contract.
[61 FR 14505, Apr. 2, 1996]


<R05>
1516.303-77  Administrative requirements.

    (a) The initial Procurement Request shall reflect the total 
estimated cost of the cost-sharing contract. The face page of the 
contract award shall indicate the total estimated cost of the contract, 
the Contractor's share of the cost, and the Government's share of the 
cost.
    (b) The manner of cost-sharing and how it is to be accomplished 
shall be set forth in the contract. Additionally, contracts which 
provide for cost-sharing shall require the contractor to maintain 
records adequate to reflect the nature and extent of their cost-sharing 
as well as those costs charged the Agency. Such records may be subject 
to an Agency audit.
[61 FR 14505, Apr. 2, 1996]


<R05>
1516.307  Contract clauses.

    (a) The Contracting Officer shall insert the clause in 1552.216-71, 
Date of Incurrence of Cost, in cost-reimbursement contracts when an 
anticipatory cost letter has been issued on the project.
    (b) The Contracting Officer shall insert the clause at 1552.216-74, 
Payment of Fee, in solicitations and contracts where a cost-
reimbursement term form contract is contemplated, unless the Contracting 
Officer determines that such a provision would be detrimental to 
ensuring proper contract performance.
    (c) The Contracting Officer shall insert a clause substantially the 
same as 48 CFR 1552.216-76, Estimated Cost and Cost-Sharing, in 
solicitations and contracts where the total incurred costs are shared by 
the contractor on a straight percentage basis. The Contracting Officer 
may develop other

[[Page 37]]

clauses, as appropriate, following the same approach, but reflecting 
different cost-sharing arrangements negotiated on specific contract 
actions.
[49 FR 8852, Mar. 8, 1984, as amended at 56 FR 43711, Sept. 4, 1991; 61

<R05>
1516.370  Solicitation provision.

    The solicitation document shall state whether any cost-sharing is 
required, and may set forth a target level of cost-sharing. Although 
technical considerations are normally most important, the degree of 
cost-sharing may be considered in a selection decision when cost becomes 
a determinative factor in a selection decision.

amount of award fee to be awarded to the contractor.
[60 FR 43404, Aug. 21, 1995]


<R05>
1516.404-273  Limitations.

    (a) No award fee may be earned if the Fee Determination Official 
determines that contractor performance has been satisfactory or less 
than satisfactory. A contractor may earn award fee only for performance 
rated above satisfactory or excellent. All award fee plans shall 
disclose to offerors the numerical rating necessary to be deemed ``above 
satisfactory'' or ``excellent'' for award fee purposes.
    (b) The base fee shall not exceed three percent of the estimated 
cost of the contract, exclusive of the fee.
    (c) Unearned award fee may not be carried forward from one 
performance period into a subsequent performance period unless approved 
by the FDO.
    (d) The payment of award fee on a provisional basis is not 
authorized.

<R05>
1517.207  Exercise of options.

    (a) Unless otherwise approved by the Chief of the Contracting 
Office, contracts for services employing option periods shall require 
that a preliminary written notice of the Government's intention to 
exercise the option be furnished to the Contractor a minimum of sixty 
(60) calendar days prior to the date for the exercise of the option. 
Failure to provide such preliminary notice within the timeframe 
established in the contract waives the Government's right to 
unilaterally exercise the option and requires the negotiation of a 
bilateral contract modification in order to extend the period of 
performance, where such an extension is authorized.
    (b) When the term of the service contract coincides with the fiscal 
year and delays in receipt of authority to obligate funds for the new 
fiscal year are anticipated, the Contracting Officer, if the contract so 
provides (see FAR 17.204(d)), may, within 60 days after the end of the 
fiscal year, unilaterally exercise an option to extend the term of the 
contract. The option may be exercised only if funds become available 
within the 60-day period. In the event that sufficient funding is not 
available within the 60 day period, the Government waives the right to 
exercise the option, thereby rendering any additional requirements 
subject to full and open competition requirements.
    (c) The Contracting Officer, if the contract so provides, may, 
subject to the conditions in FAR 17.204(d), 32.703-2, and 32.705-1(a), 
exercise an option contingent upon the availability of funds. To 
exercise such an option, the contract must contain the clause in FAR 
52.232-18, Availability of Funds. Under no circumstances shall any 
action be taken which could be construed as creating a legal liability 
on the part of the Government until a formal notice of availability of 
funds in the form of a contract modification has been issued by the 
Contracting Officer.

<R05>
1519.201  Policy.

    Each program's Assistant or Associate Administrator shall be 
responsible for developing its socioeconomic goals on a fiscal year 
basis. The goals shall be developed in collaboration with the supporting 
Chiefs of Contracting Offices and the local Small Business Specialist 
(SBS), and the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization 
(OSDBU). The goals will be based on advance procurement plans and past 
performance. The goals shall be submitted to the Director, OSDBU, at 
least thirty (30) days prior to the start of the fiscal year.

<R05>
1519.201-71  Director of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization.

    The Director, OSDBU, provides guidance and advice, as appropriate, 
to Agency program and contracts officials on small and small 
disadvantaged business programs. The Director, OSDBU, is the central 
point of contact for inquiries concerning the small and disadvantaged 
business programs from industry, the Small Business Administration 
(SBA), and the Congress, and shall advise the Administrator and staff of 
such inquiries as required. The Director, OSDBU, shall represent the 
Agency in the negotiations with the other Government agencies on small 
and small disadvantaged business matters.

1519.201-72  Small and disadvantaged business utilization specialists.

    (a) Small Business Specialists (SBS) shall be appointed in writing 
for each contracting office. The SBS will normally be appointed from 
members of staffs of the appointing authority. The SBS is 
administratively responsible directly to the appointing authority and, 
on matters relating to small and small disadvantaged business program 
activities, receives technical guidance from the Director, OSDBU. The 
appointing authorities are the Chiefs of the Contracting Offices.
    (b) A copy of each appointment and termination of all SBS 
specialists shall be forwarded to the Director, OSDBU. In addition to 
performing the duties outlined in paragraph (c) of this section that are 
normally performed in the activity to which assigned, the SBS shall 
perform such additional functions as may be prescribed from time to time 
in furtherance of overall small and small disadvantaged business 
utilization program goals. The SBS may be appointed on either a full- or 
part-time basis; however, when appointed on a

[[Page 41]]

part-time basis, the small business duty shall take precedence over 
collateral responsibilities.
    (c) The SBS appointed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, 
shall perform the following duties as appropriate:
    (1) Maintain a program designed to locate capable small business 
sources for current and future acquisitions;
    (2) Coordinate inquiries and requests for advice from small and 
small disadvantaged business concerns on acquisition matters;
    (3) Review all proposed solicitations in excess of the simplified 
acquisition threshold, assure that small business concerns will be 
afforded an equitable opportunity to compete, and, as appropriate, 
initiate recommendations for small business set-asides, or offers of 
requirements to the SBA for the 8(a) program, and complete EPA Form 
1900-37, ``Record of Procurement Request Review,'' as appropriate:
    (4) Take action to assure the availability of adequate 
specifications and drawings, when necessary, to obtain small business 
participation in an acquisition. When small business concerns cannot be 
given an opportunity on a current acquisition, initiate action, in 
writing, with appropriate technical and contracting personnel to ensure 
that necessary specifications and/or drawings for future acquisitions 
are available.
    (5) Review proposed contracts for possible breakout of items or 
services suitable for acquisition from small business and small 
disadvantaged business concerns;
    (6) Advise small businesses with respect to the financial assistance 
available under existing laws and regulations and assist such concerns 
in applying for financial assistance;
    (7) Participate in the evaluation of a prime contractor's small 
business subcontracting programs;
    (8) Assure that adequate records are maintained, and accurate 
reports prepared, concerning small business participation in acquisition 
programs (see 1519.202-5);
    (9) Make available to SBA copies of solicitations when so requested;
    (10) Act as liaison with the appropriate SBA office or 
representative in connection with set-asides, certificates of 
competency, size classification, and any other matter concerning the 
small or small disadvantaged business programs.

acquisition actions and dollars awarded to small businesses, small 
disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, the Small 
Business Administration under the authority of section 8(a) of the Small 
Business Act, and information on actions and dollars made under small 
business set-asides shall be submitted by the Procurement and Contracts 
Management Division, to the Director, OSDBU.
    (b) The Financial Management Division will submit to the Director, 
OSDBU, a copy of the Small Purchase Activity Report that shows by each 
EPA purchasing activity the following information (cumulative monthly)

available, the Small Business Specialist (SBS) shall initiate 
recommendations to the Contracting Officer for small business set-asides 
with respect to individual acquisitions or classes of acquisitions or 
portions thereof.
    (b) When the SBS has recommended that all, or a portion, of an

    (a) Each proposed acquisition for construction estimated to cost 
between $10,000 and $1,000,000 shall be set-aside for exclusive small 
business participation. Such set-asides shall be considered to be 
unilateral small business set-asides, and shall be withdrawn in 
accordance with the procedure of FAR 19.506 only if found not to serve 
the best interest of the Government.
    (b) Small business set-aside preferences for construction 
acquisitions in excess of $1,000,000 shall be considered on a case-by-
case basis.

          Subpart 1523.70--Energy-Efficient Computer Equipment

    Source: 61 FR 14506, Apr. 2, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
1523.7000  Background.

    (a) Executive Order 12845 requires the Federal Government to 
purchase only microcomputers, including personal computers, monitors and 
printers, which meet ``EPA Energy Star'' requirements for energy 
efficiency. This equipment is often identified by the Energy 
Star<SUP>TM</SUP> logo and is capable of entering and recovering from an 
energy-efficient low power state.
    (b) The EPA Energy Star Computer Program is a voluntary partnership 
effort with the computer industry to promote the introduction of energy-
efficient personal computers, monitors, and printers which can reduce 
air pollution caused by utility power generation, and ease the burden on 
building air conditioning and electrical systems. The Energy Star 
Program is designed to be a self-certifying computer industry program, 
policed informally by the computer industry itself.
    (c) FIRMR Bulletin C-35 (dated 11/19/93) describes procedures that 
will promote the acquisition of energy-efficient microcomputers and 
associated computer equipment.


<R05>
1523.7001  Policy.

    (a) The ``Energy Star'' Executive Order (E.O. 12845) applies to the 
following equipment:
    (1) Personal Computers (stand-alone).
    (2) Personal Computers (end-user on network).
    (3) Notebook and other portable computers.
    (4) PC printers - laser, inkjet or dot matrix (stand-alone or 
networked).
    (5) High-speed printers used on a PC network (less than 
approximately 20 pages per minute).
    (6) Monitors (CRT or Flat-panel LCD).
    (b) ``Energy Star'' requirements do not apply to the following 
equipment:
    (1) Workstations.
    (2) File servers.
    (3) Mainframe equipment.
    (4) Minicomputers.
    (5) High-speed printers used with mainframe computers (30 or more 
pages per minute).
    (6) Mainframe or ``dumb'' terminals.
    (7) X-terminals.
    (c) All new acquisitions for microcomputers, including personal 
computers, monitors, and printers, shall contain specifications which 
meet EPA Energy Star requirements for energy efficiency unless a waiver 
has been obtained in accordance with internal Agency procedures. The EPA 
Energy Star requirement applies in instances where the Contracting 
Officer authorizes the contractor to acquire property in accordance with 
FAR 45.302-1.
    (d) The Energy Star requirement also applies to all applicable 
equipment ordered from GSA Schedule Contracts, open market buys, and 
Bankcard purchases.


<R05>
1523.7002  Waivers.

    (a) There are several types of computer equipment which technically 
fall under the current Energy Star Program, but for which EPA 
established blanket waivers because Energy Star compliant versions of 
this equipment were unavailable in the marketplace. Blanket waivers 
apply to the following types of equipment:
    (1) LAN servers, including file servers; application servers; 
communication servers; including bridges and routers;

[[Page 45]]

    (2) UNIX RISC based processors with their high-end monitors;
    (3) Large LAN printers (greater than 19 pages/minute output); and
    (4) Scientific computing equipment which is used for real-time data 
acquisition and which, if subjected to a power down mode, would 
jeopardize the research project.
    (b) It is anticipated that there will be Energy Star models of this 
equipment in the future, but in the near term EPA will not specify 
Energy Star qualifications when purchasing the items listed in this 
section.


<R05>
1523.7003  Contract clause.

    The Contracting Officer shall insert a clause substantially the same 
as 48 CFR 1552.239-103, Acquisition of Energy Star Compliant 
Microcomputers, Including Personal Computers, Monitors, and Printers, in 
all solicitations and contracts for the acquisition of microcomputers, 
including personal computers, monitors and printers. The Contracting 
Officer shall also insert the clause in solicitations and contracts 
where the Contracting Officer authorizes the contractor to acquire 
property in accordance with FAR 45.302-1.

official and two duplicate files shall be forwarded through legal 
counsel to the Office of Acquisition Management for review. The

timely submission cannot be made, he/she shall immediately advise legal 
counsel by telephone of the extent of the anticipated delay and the 
reasons therefor. However, every effort will be exerted to make timely 
submissions.
    (6) At the time of transmittal of the appeal file to the Board, the 
Contracting Officer shall notify the appellant of the transmittal and 
provide a copy of the appeal file to the appellant. Within the

    (c) If the Contracting Officer determines that a potential conflict 
exists, the prospective Contractor shall not receive an award unless the

special contract clause or other appropriate means. The terms of any 
special clause are subject to negotiation.

under the 8(a) program); and
    (c) When the procurement is accomplished through simplified 
acquisition procedures, use of the clause is optional.

             Organizational Conflicts of Interest (May 1994)

information.

notify the Contracting Officer immediately that, to the best of its 
knowledge and belief, no actual or potential conflict of interest exists

conflict of interest the firm may have. In emergency situations,

working days.
    (c) The Contractor agrees that if an actual or potential 
organizational conflict of interest is identified during performance, 
the Contractor will immediately make a full disclosure in writing to the 
Contracting Officer. This disclosure shall include a description of 
actions which the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after 
consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or 
neutralize the actual or potential conflict of interest. The Contractor 
shall continue performance until notified by the Contracting Officer of 
any contrary action to be taken.
    (d) Remedies--The EPA may terminate this contract for convenience, 
in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid an 
organizational conflict of interest. If the Contractor was aware of a 
potential organizational conflict of interest prior to award or 
discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not 
disclose it or misprepresented relevant information to the Contracting 
officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, debar 
the Contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other 
remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.
    (e) The Contractor agrees to insert in each subcontract or 
consultant agreement placed hereunder, except for subcontracts or

working on or having access to information regarding this contract, or 
(2) any such conflicts concerning subcontractor employees or consultants 
working on or having access to information regarding this contract, when 
such conflicts have been reported to the Contractor. A personal conflict 
of interest is defined as a relationship of an employee, subcontractor 
employee, or consultant with an entity that may impair the objectivity 
of the employee, subcontractor employee, or consultant in performing the 
contract work.
    (c) The Contractor agrees to notify each Project Officer and 
Contracting Officer prior to incurring costs for that employee's work 
when an employee may have a personal conflict of interest. In the event 
that the personal conflict of interest does not become known until after 
performance on the contract begins, the Contractor shall immediately 
notify the Contracting Officer of the personal conflict of interest. The 
Contractor shall continue performance of this contract until notified by 
the Contracting Officer of the appropriate action to be taken.
    (d) The Contractor agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant 
agreement placed hereunder, except for subcontracts or consultant 
agreements for well drilling, fence erecting, plumbing, utility hookups, 
security guard services, or electrical services, provisions which shall 
conform substantially to the language of this clause, including this 
paragraph (d), unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer.

    As prescribed in 1509.507-2(c), insert the following clause or 
alternate:

           Limitation of Future Contracting (ARCS) (Mar 1997)

    (a) The parties to this contract agree that the Contractor will be 
restricted in its future contracting in the manner described below. 
Except as specifically provided in this clause, the Contractor shall be 
free to compete for contracts on an equal basis with other companies.
    (b) The Contractor will be ineligible to enter into a contract for 
remedial action projects for which the Contractor has developed the 
statement of work or the solicitation package.
    (c) The following applies when ARCS work is performed under this 
contract and when both ARCS work and Field Investigative Team (FIT) work 
are performed on the same site under this contract: Unless prior written 
approval is obtained from the cognizant EPA Contracting Officer, the 
Contractor, during the life of the work assignment and for a period of 
five (5) years after the completion of the work assignment, agrees not 
to enter into a contract with or to represent any party, other than EPA, 
with respect to: (1) any work relating to CERCLA activities which 
pertain to a site where the Contractor previously performed work for EPA 
under this contract; or (2) any work that may jeopardize CERCLA 
enforcement actions which pertain to a site where the Contractor 
previously performed work for the EPA under this contract.
    (d) The following applies to FIT work at sites under this contract 
where only FIT work is performed, except for those sites where EPA has 
made a determination of ``no further remedial action planned'' (NFRAP): 
Unless prior written approval is obtained from the cognizant EPA 
Contracting Officer, the Contractor, during the life of the work 
assignment and for a period of three (3) years after the completion of 
the work assignment, agrees not to enter into a contract with or to 
represent any party, other than EPA, with respect to: (1) Any work 
relating to CERCLA activities which pertain to a site where the 
Contractor previously performed work for EPA under this contract; or (2) 
any work that may jeopardize CERCLA enforcement actions which pertain to 
a site where the Contractor previously performed work for the EPA under 
this contract.
    (e) The Contractor and any subcontractors, during the life of this 
contract, shall be ineligible to enter into an EPA contract or a 
subcontract under an EPA contract, which supports EPA's performance of 
Superfund Headquarters policy work including support for the analysis 
and development of regulations, policies, or guidance that govern, 
affect, or relate to the conduct of response action activities, unless 
otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer. Examples of such 
contracts include, but are not limited to, Superfund Management and 
Analytical support contracts, and Superfund Technical and Analytical 
support contracts.
    (f) The Contractor agrees in advance that if any bids/proposals are 
submitted for any work that would require written approval of the 
Contracting Officer prior to entering into a contract subject to the 
restrictions of this clause, then the bids/proposals are submitted at 
the Contractor's own risk. Therefore, no claim shall be made against the 
Government to recover bid/proposal costs as a direct cost whether the 
request for authorization to enter into the contract is denied or 
approved.

[[Page 61]]

    (g) To the extent that the work under this contract requires access 
to proprietary or confidential business or financial data of other 
companies, and as long as such data remains proprietary or confidential, 
the Contractor shall protect such data from unauthorized use and 
disclosure.
    (h) The Contractor agrees to insert in each subcontract or 
consultant agreement placed hereunder, except for subcontracts or 
consultant agreements for nondiscretionary technical or engineering 
services, including treatability studies, well drilling, fence erecting, 
plumbing, utility hookups, security guard services, or electrical 
services, provisions which shall conform substantially to the language 
of this clause, including this paragraph (g) unless otherwise authorized 
by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor may request in writing that 
the Contracting Officer exempt from this clause a particular subcontract 
or consultant agreement for nondiscretionary technical or engineering 
services not specifically listed above, including laboratory analysis. 
The Contracting Officer will review and evaluate each request on a case-
by-case basis before approving or disapproving the request.
    (i) If the Contractor seeks an expedited decision regarding its 
initial future contracting request, the Contractor may submit its 
request to both the Contracting Officer and the next administrative 
level within the Contracting Officer's organization.
    (j) A review process available to the Contractor when an adverse 
determination is received shall consist of a request for reconsideration 
to the Contracting Officer or a request for review submitted to the next 
administrative level within the Contracting Officer's organization. An 
adverse determination resulting from a request for reconsideration by 
the Contracting Officer will not preclude the contractor from requesting 
a review by the next administrative level. Either a request for review 
or a request for reconsideration must be submitted to the appropriate 
level within 30 calendar days after receipt of the initial adverse 
determination.

                             (End of clause)

     Limitation of Future Contracting Alternate I (TCRR) (Mar 1997)

    (a) The parties to this contract agree that the Contractor will be 
restricted in its future contracting in the manner described below. 
Except as specifically provided in this clause, the Contractor shall be 
free to compete for contracts on an equal basis with other companies.
    (b) If the Contractor, under the terms of this contract, or through 
the performance of work pursuant to this contract, is required to 
develop specifications or statements of work and such specifications or 
statements of work are incorporated into an EPA solicitation, the 
Contractor shall be ineligible to perform the work described in that 
solicitation as a prime Contractor or subcontractor under an ensuing EPA 
contract.

    As prescribed in 1511.011-73, insert the following contract clause 
in cost-reimbursement term contracts including cost contracts without 
fee, cost-sharing contracts, cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contracts, cost-
plus-incentive-fee contracts (CPIF), and cost-plus-award-fee contracts 
(CPAF).

      Level of Effort--Cost-Reimbursement Term Contract (Apr 1984)

    (a) The Contractor shall perform all work and provide all required 
reports within the level of effort specified below. The Government 
hereby orders----direct labor hours for the base period, which 
represents the Government's best estimate of the level of effort to 
fulfill these requirements.
    (b) Direct labor includes personnel such as engineers, scientists, 
draftsmen, technicians, statisticians, and programmers and not support 
personnel such as company management, typists, and key punch operators 
even though such support personnel are normally treated as direct labor 
by the Contractor. The level of effort specified in paragraph (a) 
includes Contractor, subcontractor, and consultant labor hours.
    (c) If the Contractor provides less than 90 percent of the level of 
effort specified for the base period or any optional period ordered, an 
equitable downward adjustment of the fixed fee, if any, for that period 
will be made. The Government may require the Contractor to provide 
additional effort up to 110 percent of the level of effort for any 
period until the estimated cost for that period has been reached. 
However, this additional effort shall not result in any increase in the 
fixed fee, if any. If this is a cost-plus-incentive-fee (CPIF) contract, 
the term ``fee'' in this paragraph means ``base fee and incentive fee.'' 
If

[[Page 69]]

this is a cost-plus-award-fee (CPAF) contract, the term ``fee'' in this 
paragraph means ``base fee and award fee.''
    (d) If the level of effort specified to be ordered during a given 
base or option period is not ordered during that period, that level of 
effort may not be acumulated and ordered during a subsequent period.
    (e) These terms and conditions do not supersede the requirements of 
either the ``Limitation of Cost'' or ``Limitation of Funds'' clauses.

in cost-reimbursement type term form contracts when work assignments are 
to be used.

                       Work Assignments (Apr 1984)

    (a) The contractor shall perform work under this contract as 
specified in written work assignments issued by the Contracting Officer.
    (b) Each work assignment will include (1) a numerical designation, 
(2) the estimate of required labor hours, (3) the period of performance 
and schedule of deliverables, and (4) the description of the work.
    (c) The Contractor shall acknowledge receipt of each work assignment 
by returning to the Contracting Officer a signed copy of the work 
assignment within ____ calendar days after its receipt. The Contractor 
shall begin work immediately upon receipt of a work assignment. Within 
____ calendar days after receipt of a work assignment, the Contractor 
shall submit ____ copies of a work plan to the Project Officer and ____ 
copies to the Contracting Officer. The work plan shall include a 
detailed technical and staffing plan and a detailed cost estimate. 
Within ____ calendar days after receipt of the work plan, the 
Contracting Officer will provide written approval or disapproval of it 
to the Contractor. If the Contractor has not received approval on a work 
plan within ____ calendar days after its submission, the Contractor 
shall stop work on that work assignment. Also, if the Contracting 
Officer disapproves a work plan, the Contractor shall stop work until 
the problem causing the disapproval is resolved. In either case, the 
Contractor shall resume work only when the Contracting Officer finally 
approves the work plan.
    (d) This clause does not change the requirements of the ``Level of 
Effort'' clause, nor the notification requirements of either the 
``Limitation of Cost'' or ``Limitation of Funds'' clauses.
    (e) Work assignments shall not allow for any change to the terms or 
conditions of the contract. Where any language in the work assignment 
may suggest a change to the terms or conditions, the Contractor shall 
immediately notify the Contracting Officer.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I. As prescribed in 1512.104(b), modify the existing 
clause by adding the following paragraph (f) to the basic clause:
    (f) Within 20 days of receipt of the work assignment or similar 
tasking document, the Contractor shall provide a conflict of interest 
certification. Where work assignments or similar tasking documents are 
issued under this contract for work on or directly related to a site, 
the Contractor is only required to provide a conflict of interest 
certification for the first work assignment issued for that site. For 
all subsequent work on that site under this contract, the Contractor has 
a continuing obligation to search and report any actual or potential 
conflicts of interest, but no additional conflict of interest 
certifications are required.
    Before submitting the conflict of interest certification, the 
contractor shall search its records accumulated, at a minimum, over the 
past three years immediately prior to the receipt of the work assignment 
or similar tasking document. In the COI certification, the Contractor 
must certify to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, that 
all actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest have been 
reported to the Contracting Officer or that to the best of the 
Contractor's knowledge and belief, no actual or potential organizational 
conflicts of interest exist. In addition, the Contractor must certify 
that its personnel who perform work under this work assignment or 
relating to this work assignment have been informed of their obligation 
to report personal and organizational conflicts of interest to the 
Contractor. The certification shall also include a statement that the 
Contractor recognizes its continuing obligation to identify and report 
any actual or potential conflicts of interest arising during performance 
of this work assignment or other work related to this site.
    Alternate II. As prescribed in 1512.104(b), modify the existing 
clause by adding the following paragraph (f) to the basic clause:
    (f) Within 20 days of receipt of the work assignment or similar 
tasking document, the Contractor shall provide a conflict of interest 
certification. Where work assignments or similar tasking documents are 
issued under this contract for work on or directly related to a site, 
the Contractor is only required to provide a conflict of interest 
certification for the first work assignment issued for that site. For 
all subsequent work on that site under this contract, the Contractor has 
a continuing obligation to search and report

[[Page 70]]

any actual or potential conflicts of interest, but no additional 
conflict of interest certifications are required.
    Before submitting the conflict of interest certification, the 
contractor shall initially search through all of its available records 
to identify any actual or potential conflicts of interest. During the 
first three years of this contract, the contractor shall search through 
all records created since the beginning of the contract plus the records 
of the contractor prior to the award of the contract until a minimum of 
three years of records are accumulated. Once three years of records have 
accumulated, prior to certifying, the contractor shall search its 
records accumulated, at a minimum, over the past three years immediately 
prior to the receipt of the work assignment or similar tasking document. 
In the certification, the Contractor must certify to the best of the 
Contractor's knowledge and belief, that all actual or potential 
organizational conflicts of interest have been reported to the 
Contracting Officer or that to the best of the Contractor's knowledge 
and belief, no actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest 
exist. In addition, the Contractor must certify that its personnel who 
perform work under this work assignment or relating to this work 
assignment have been informed of their obligation to report personal and 
organizational conflicts of interest to the Contractor. The 
certification shall also include a statement that the Contractor 
recognizes its continuing obligation to identify and report any actual 
or potential conflicts of interest arising during performance of this 
work assignment or other work related to this site.

proposed cost or price provides an adequate reflection of the offeror's 
understanding of the requirements of this solicitation, i.e., that the 
cost or price is not unrealistically low or unreasonably high.
    (2) The Government will evaluate technical proposals as specified in

   Instructions for the Preparation of Technical and Cost or Pricing 
                          Proposals (Aug. 1993)

    (a) Technical proposal instructions.
    (1) Submit your technical proposal as a separate part of the total 
proposal package. Omit all cost or pricing details from the technical 
proposal. Include the following elements in your technical proposal (see 
also the Statement of Work and the Technical Evaluation Criteria):
    (i) Technical approach;
    (ii) Technical management;
    (iii) Key technical personnel;
    (iv) Assumptions, deviations, and exceptions (as necessary); and
    (v) Additional information.
    (2) Special technical proposal instructions.
 _______________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________
    (b) Cost or pricing proposal instructions.
    Your cost or price proposal shall be specific, complete in every 
detail, and separate from your technical proposal. In addition to a hard 
copy of the information, to expedite review of your proposal, you are 
requested to submit a computer disk containing the financial data 
required under 1552.21573(b)(2) through (b)(9), if this information is 
available using a commercial spreadsheet program on a personal computer. 
Please indicate the software program used to create this information. 
Offerors should include the formulas and factors used in calculating the 
financial data on the disk as well as the

[[Page 74]]

basic financial information. Although submission of the computer disk 
will expedite review, failure to submit the disk will not affect 
consideration of your proposal.
    (1) General--Submit cost or pricing data on Standard Form 1411, 
Contract Pricing Proposal Cover Sheet, prepared in accordance with FAR 
15.804-6, FAR Table 15-3, and the following:
    (i) Clearly identify separate cost or pricing data associated with 
any:
    (A) Options to extend the term of the contract;
    (B) Options for the Government to order incremental quantities; and/
or
    (C) Major tasks, if required by the special instructions.

You may indicate the above cost or price detailed data in narrative form 
or on a spread sheet, provided that all cost or pricing data is 
adequately and clearly described. Place recap/summary information on the 
SF 1411.
    (ii) Clearly identify all costs and data in support of the proposed 
cost/price. Include the index required by FAR 15.804, Table 15-2 
Paragraph 4.
    (iii) Submit a current financial statement, including a balance 
sheet and a statement of profit and loss for the last completed fiscal 
year. Specify resources available to perform the contract without 
assistance from any outside source. If sufficient resources are not 
available, indicate in your proposal the amount required and the 
anticipated source (i.e., bank loans, letter or lines of credit, etc.).
    (iv) If other division, subsidiaries, a parent or affiliated 
companies will perform work or furnish materials under this proposed 
contract, please provide the name and location of such affiliate and 
your intercompany pricing policy. Separately identify costs and 
supporting data for each such entity proposed.
    (v) If the contract schedule includes a ``Fixed Rates for Services'' 
clause, please provide in your cost proposal a schedule duplicating the 
format in the clause and include your proposed fixed hourly rates per 
labor category for the base and any option contract periods.
    (vi) If the contract includes the clause at EPAAR 1552.232-73, 
``Payments--Fixed-Rate Services Contract,'' or the clause at FAR 52.232-
7, ``Payments Under Time and Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts,'' 
include in your cost proposal the estimated costs and burden rate you 
will apply to materials, other direct costs, or subcontracts. The 
Government will include these costs as part of its cost proposal 
evaluation.
    (vii) Whenever subcontractor effort is included in the proposed 
costs, the prime contractor shall include an additional supporting cost 
summary consolidating all costs (both contractor and subcontractor) by 
element for each contract period.
    (2) Direct Labor.
    (i) Attach support schedules for each proposed labor category, 
indicating both proposed hours and rates. Explain the basis of the 
proposed labor rates, including a complete justification for all 
judgmental factors used to develop weights applied to your company's 
category or individual rates that comprise the rates for labor 
categories specified in the solicitation. This explanation should 
describe how your technical approach coincides with the proposed costs.
    Describe for each labor category proposed your company's 
qualifications and experiences requirements. If individual rates are 
used, also provide the employee's name. If specific individuals are 
identified in the technical proposal, correlate these individuals with 
the labor categories specified in the solicitation.
    Provide a matrix summarizing the effort proposed, including the 
subcontracts, by professional and technical level specified in the 
solicitation.
    (ii) Indicate whether current rates or escalated rates are used. If 
escalation is included, state the degree (percent) and methodology. The 
methodology shall include the effective date of the base rates and the 
policy on salary reviews (e.g. anniversary date of employee or salary 
reviews for all employees on a specific date).
    (iii) State whether any additional direct labor (new hires) will be 
required during the performance period of this acquisition. If so, state 
the number required.
    (iv) With respect to educational institutions, include the following 
information for those professional staff members whose salary is 
expected to be covered by a stipulated salary support agreement pursuant 
to OMB Circular A-21.
    (A) Individual's name;
    (B) Annual salary and the period for which the salary is applicable;
    (C) List of other research projects or proposals for which salary is 
allocated, and the proportionate time charged to each; and
    (D) Other duties, such as teaching assignments, adminstrative 
assignments, and other institutional activities. Show the proportionate 
time charged to each. (Show proportionate time charges as a percentage 
of 100% of time for the entire academic year, exclusive of vacation or 
sabbatical leave.)
    (3) Indirect costs (overhead, general, and administrative expenses). 
Unless your proposed indirect rate(s) have recently been accepted by a 
contracting agency of the Government, provide detailed supporting 
computations. These computations may include historical as well as 
budgeted data. Indicate whether your computations are based upon 
historical or projected data. If your rates have been recently approved, 
include a copy of the agreement. If the agreement does not cover the 
projected performance period of the proposed effort, provide the 
rationale

[[Page 75]]

and any estimated rate calculations for the proposed performance period.
    (4) Travel expense.
    (i) Attach a schedule illustrating how travel was computed. Include 
a breakdown indicating the number of trips, number of travellers, 
destination, purpose and cost.
    (ii) If the solicitation specifies the amount of travel costs, this 
amount is exclusive of any applicable indirect costs and fee.
    (5) Consultant service.
    Identify the contemplated consultants. State the amount of service 
estimated to be required and the consultant's quoted daily or hourly 
rate.
    (6) When the cost of a subcontract is substantial (25 percent of the 
estimated contract value or $10,000, whichever is less), include details 
of subcontract costs in the same format as the prime Contractor's costs. 
Include a cost or price analysis of the subcontract costs in accordance 
with FAR 15.806-1(a)(2).
    (7) Equipment (not including special equipment).
    (i) If direct charges for use of existing contractor equipment are 
proposed, provide a description of these items and details of the basis 
of such charges.
    (ii) If equipment purchases are proposed, provide a description of 
these items, details of the proposed costs (including at least three 
price quotes), and a justification as to why the Government should 
furnish the equipment or allow its purchase with contract funds.
    (iii) Identify Government-owned property in the possession of the 
offeror or proposed to be used in the performance of the contract, and 
the Government agency which has cognizance over the property.
    (8) Facilities and special equipment, including tooling.
    (i) If special purpose facilities or equipment is being proposed, 
provide a description of these items, details of the proposed costs 
including competitive prices, and justification as to why the Government 
should furnish the equipment or allow its purchase with contract funds.
    (ii) If fabrication by the prime Contractor is contemplated, include 
details of material, labor, and overhead.
    (9) Other Direct Costs.
    (i) Attach a schedule detailing how other direct costs were 
computed. Identify the major ODC items that under your accounting system 
would be a direct change on any resulting contract.
    (ii) If the solicitation specifies the amount of other direct costs, 
this amount is exclusive of any applicable indirect cost and fee.

                           (End of provision)

    Alternate I (AUG 1993). If this solicitation is for a cost-
reimbursable, level of effort type contract, add the following at the 
end of paragraph (b)(2)(i):
    All management and support (such as clerical, corporate and day-to-
day management) hours and costs proposed to be a direct charge, in 
accordance with your normal accounting treatment, are to be shown 
separately from that for the technical effort.
    Alternate II (AUG 1993). If the Government's requirement is a fully 
dedicated staff person for a twelve month period(s) for each specified 
position and performance is on a Government facility, add the following 
paragraph (b)(2)(v) to the basic provision:
    (v) The level of effort for each position is to be proposed in 
workyears. A workyear is considered to consist of 2080 hours inclusive 
of direct and indirect time (40 hours per week  x  52 weeks per year = 
2080 hours). Your proposal must identify proposed workyears and clearly 
identify how many hours in each workyear are direct (i.e. productive 
working hours) and how many are indirect (i.e. paid absences). If your 
company policy includes a different base work week, your total available 
hours would be different. For example, if your company's policy calls 
for a 37.5 hour work week, you would deduct your paid absences from 1950 
hours (37.5 hr/wk  x  52wks/yr = 1950 hrs). It should also clearly 
identify the paid absences as to how many hours are for holiday and how 
many hours are for vacation and sick leave.

    The amount of indirect time (paid absences) identified in your 
proposal must be consistent with company policy and must allow for the 
ten Federal Government holidays.
    Alternate III (AUG 1993). If the Government's requirement is a fully 
dedicated staff person for a twelve month period(s) for each specified 
position and performance is not on a Government facility, add the 
following paragraph (b)(2)(v) to the basic provision:
    (v) The level of effort for each position is to be proposed in 
workyears. A workyear is considered to consist of 2080 hours inclusive 
of direct and indirect time (40 hours per week  x  52 weeks per year 
=2080 hours). Your proposal must identify proposed workyears and clearly 
identify how many hours in each workyear are direct (i.e. productive 
working hours) and how many are indirect (i.e. paid absences). If your 
company policy includes a different base work week, your total available 
hours would be different. For example, if your company's policy calls 
for a 37.5 hour work week, you would deduct your paid absences from 1950 
hours (37.5 hr/wk  x  52 wks/yr = 1950 hrs).

1552.215-74  Cost proposal instructions.

    As prescribed in 1515.407(c), insert a provision substantially as 
follows in negotiated procurement solicitation documents when cost or 
pricing data is required in an offeror's proposal and it is necessary to 
obtain the detailed cost data specified in the provision. While designed 
to obtain cost data for procurements under the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (``Super 
Fund'') program, the provision may be used in other negotiated 
solicitations.

                  Cost Proposal Instructions (Aug 1993)

    Offerors are instructed to prepare their cost proposals in 
sufficient detail to permit thorough and complete evaluation by the 
Government. Categories of labor to be employed, for example, and the 
associated number of estimated hours per category, shall be clearly 
identified. All items of equipment, together with estimated usage hours, 
shall be set forth. All material costs, travel and per diem costs, 
analysis costs, and transportation and disposal costs shall be 
identified as well. Where proposed rates are not based upon catalog or 
list prices, the basis for the proposed rates shall be identified. 
Equipment rates may be proposed on any basis (e.g., hourly, daily, 
weekly, monthly).
    The cost proposal shall be submitted on Standard Form 1411, Contract 
Pricing Proposal Cover Sheet, prepared in accordance with general 
instructions in FAR 15.804-6 and FAR Table 15-3. Summary data should be 
placed on SF 1411, and the following format should be followed in 
preparing the detailed cost proposal. All items which are subcontracted 
should be clearly identified and should include the name and address of 
the proposed subcontractor. Written quotations for all subcontracted 
services must accompany your cost proposal.

sensitive nature which should not be released to the public without 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approval. Therefore, the

result in such disclosure, the Contractor must provide immediate advance 
notification to the EPA so that the EPA can authorize such disclosure or 
have the opportunity to take action to prevent such disclosure. Such 
agreements shall be effective for the life of the contract and for a 
period of five (5) years after completion of the contract.

convenience, or pursue other remedies as may be permitted by law or this 
contract.

    (a) Hourly rate. (1) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying 
the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the Schedule by the number of 
direct labor hours performed. The rates shall include wages, indirect 
costs, general and administrative expenses, and profit. Fractional parts 
of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis. Vouchers may be 
submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by

substantiate vouchers by evidence of actual payment and by individual 
daily job, timecards, or other substantiation approved by the

withheld shall be retained until the execution and delivery of a release 
by the Contractor as provided in paragraph (f) of this contract.
    (3) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in 
the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having 
performed work on an overtime basis. If no overtime rates are provided 
in the Schedule and overtime work is approved in advance by the 
Contracting Officer, overtime rates shall be negotiated. Failure to 
agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the 
``Disputes'' clause of this contract. If the Schedule provides rates for 
overtime the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to 
the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer.
    (b) Materials, other direct costs, and subcontracts. (1) The 
allowability of direct materials and other direct costs shall be 
determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with subpart 31.2 of 
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in effect on the date of this 
contract. Reasonable and allocable material handling costs or indirect 
costs may be included in the charge for material or other direct costs 
to the extent they are clearly excluded from the hourly rate. Material 
handling and/or indirect cost rates are

specified in the ``Indirect Costs'' clause. Material handling costs are 
comprised of indirect costs, including, when appropriate, general and 
administrative expense allocated to direct materials in accordance with 
the Contractor's usual accounting practices consistent with subpart 31.2 
of the FAR. The Contractor shall be reimbursed for items and services 
purchased directly for the contract only when cash, checks, or other 
forms of actual payment have been made for such purchased items or 
services. Direct materials or other direct costs, as used in this 
clause, are those items which enter directly into the end product, or 
which are used or consumed directly in connection with the furnishing of 
the end product.
    (2) Subcontracted effort may be included in the fixed hourly rates 
discussed in paragraph (a)(1) of this clause and will be reimbursed as 
discussed in that paragraph. Otherwise, the cost of subcontracts that 
are authorized under the subcontracts clause of this contract shall be 
reimbursable costs under this clause provided that the costs are 
consistent with paragraph (3) of this clause. Reimbursable costs in 
connection with subcontracts shall be limited to the amounts paid to the 
subcontractor in the same manner as for items and services purchased 
directly for the contract under paragraph (1) of this clause; however, 
this requirement shall not apply to a Contractor that is a small 
business concern. Reimbursable costs shall not include any costs arising 
from the letting, administration, or supervision of performance of the 
subcontract, if the costs are included in the hourly rates payable under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this clause.
    (3) To the extent able, the Contractor shall (i) obtain materials at 
the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing 
prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and (ii) take all cash and 
trade discounts, rebates, allowances, credits, salvage, commissions, and 
other benefits. When unable to take advantage of the benefits, the 
Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer and give the 
reasons. Credit shall be given to the Government for cash and trade 
discounts, rebates, allowances, credits, salvage, the value of any 
appreciable scrap, commissions, and other amounts that have accrued to 
the benefit of the Contractor, or would have accrued except for the 
fault or neglect of the Contractor. The benefits lost without fault or 
neglect on the part of the Contractor, or lost through fault of the 
Government, shall not be deducted from gross costs.
    (4) If the nature of the work to be performed requires the 
Contractor to furnish material which is regularly sold to the general 
public in the normal course of business by the Contractor, the price to 
be paid for such material, notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this 
contract, shall be on the basis of an established catalog or list price, 
in effect when the material is furnished, less all applicable discounts 
to the Government; provided, that in no event shall such price be in 
excess of the Contractor's sales price to its most favored customer for 
the same item in like quantity, or the current market price, whichever 
is lower.
    (c) Contracting Officer notification. For contract administration 
purposes, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing 
when the total value of all delivery orders issued exceeds 85 percent of 
the maximum price specified in the schedule.
    (d) Maximum amount. The Government shall not be obligated to pay the 
Contractor any amount in excess of the maximum amount in the Schedule, 
and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to 
do so would exceed the maximum amount set forth in the Schedule, unless 
or until the Contracting Officer shall have notified the Contractor in 
writing that the maximum amount has been increased and shall have 
specified in the notice a revised maximum that shall constitute the 
maximum amount for performance under this contract. When and to the 
extent that the maximum amount set forth in the Schedule has been 
increased, any hours expended, and material or other direct costs 
incurred by the Contractor in excess of the maximum amount before the 
increase, shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended 
and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the maximum 
amount.
    (e) Audit. At any time before final payment under this contract, the 
Contracting Officer may request audit of the invoices or vouchers and 
substantiating material. Each payment previously made shall be subject 
to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices or 
vouchers, that are found by the Contracting Officer not to have been 
properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments 
or to increase for underpayments. Upon receipt and approval of the 
voucher or invoice designated by the Contractor as the ``completion 
voucher'' or ``completion invoice'' and substantiating material, and 
upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract 
(including, without limitation, terms relating to patents and the terms 
of paragraphs (f) and (g) of this clause), the Government shall promptly 
pay any balance due the Contractor. The completion invoice or voucher, 
and substantiating material, shall be submitted by the Contractor as 
promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this 
contract, but in no event, later than one year (or such longer period as 
the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of 
completion.
    (f) Assignment. The Contractor, and each assignee under an 
assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time

[[Page 87]]

of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the 
time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this 
contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, 
and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims 
arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following 
exceptions:
    (1) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if 
the amounts are not susceptible of exact statement by the Contractor.
    (2) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon 
the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of 
performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the 
date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives 
notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after 
the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that 
the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier.
    (3) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the 
Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against 
patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by 
the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents.
    (g) Refunds. The Contractor agrees that any refunds, rebates, or 
credits (including any related interest) accruing to or received by the 
Contractor or any assignee, that arise under the materials portion of 
this contract and for which the Contractor has received reimbursement, 
shall be paid by the Contractor to the Government. The Contractor and 
each assignee, under an assignment entered into under this contract and 
in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall 
execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to 
final payment under this contract, an assignment to the Government of 
such refunds, rebates, or credits (including any interest) in form and 
substance satisfactory to the Contracting Officer.

Environmental Protection Agency, identify the information that it is 
seeking to collect, explain what will be done with the information, and

be furnished to the Contractor:

        Treatment of Confidential Business Information (Apr 1984)

Payment'' clause, the final indirect cost rates applicable to this 
contract shall be established between the Contractor and the appropriate 
Government representative (EPA, other Government agency, or auditor), as 
provided by FAR 42.703(a). EPA's procedures require a Contracting 
Officer determination of indirect cost rates for its contracts. In those 
cases where EPA is the cognizant agency (see FAR 42.705-1), the final 
rate proposal shall be submitted to the cognizant audit activity and to 
the following designated Contracting Officer: Environmental Protection 
Agency, Chief, Cost Policy and Rate Negotiation Branch (3804F), Cost 
Advisory and Financial Analysis Division, Washington, DC 20460.

Where EPA is not the cognizant agency, the final rate proposal shall be 
submitted to the above-cited address, to the cognizant audit agency, and 
to the designated Contracting Officer of the cognizant agency. Upon 
establishment of the final indirect cost rates, the Contractor shall 
submit an executed Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data (see FAR 
15.804-4) applicable to the data furnished in connection with the final 
rates to the cognizant audit agency. The final rates shall be contained 
in a written understanding between the Contractor and the appropriate 
Government representative. Pursuant to the ``Allowable Cost and 
Payment'' clause, the allowable indirect costs under this contract shall 
be obtained by applying the final agreed upon rate(s) to the appropriate 
bases.
    (b) Until final annual indirect cost rates are established for any 
period, the Government shall reimburse the contractor at billing rates 
established by the appropriate Government representative in accordance 
with FAR 42.704, subject to adjustment when the final rates are 
established. The established billing rates are currently as follows:

    These billing rates may be prospectively or retroactively revised by 
mutual agreement, at the request of either the Government or the 
Contractor, to prevent substantial overpayment or underpayment.
    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
clause, ceilings are hereby established on indirect costs reimbursable 
under this contract. The Government shall not be obligated to pay the 
Contractor any additional amount on account of indirect costs in excess 
of the ceiling rates listed below:

<R04>
              Subpart 1601.1--Purpose, Authority, Issuance


<R05>
1601.101  Purpose.

    (a) This subpart establishes chapter 16, Office of Personnel 
Management Federal Employees Health Benefits Acquisition Regulation, 
within title 48, the Federal Acquisition Regulation System, of the Code 
of Federal Regulations. The short title of this regulation shall be 
FEHBAR.
    (b) The purpose of the FEHBAR is to implement and supplement the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) specifically for acquiring and 
administering contracts with health insurance carriers in the Federal 
Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP).


<R05>
1601.102  Authority.

    (a) The FEHBAR is issued by the Director of the Office of Personnel 
Management in accordance with the authority of 5 U.S.C. chapter 89 and 
other applicable law and regulation.
    (b) The FEHBAR does not replace or incorporate regulations found at 
5 CFR part 890, which provides the substantive policy guidance for 
administration of the FEHBP under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 89. The following is 
the order of precedence in interpreting a contract provision under the 
FEHBP:
    (1) 5 U.S.C. Chapter 89;
    (2) 5 CFR part 890;
    (3) 48 CFR Chapters 1 and 16;
    (4) The FEHBP contract.
[52 FR 16037, May 1, 1987, as amended at 59 FR 14764, Mar. 30, 1994]


<R05>
1601.103  Applicability.

    The FAR is generally applicable to contracts negotiated in the FEHBP 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. chapter 89. The FEHBAR implements and supplements 
the FAR where necessary to identify basic and significant acquisition 
policies unique to the FEHBP.


<R05>
1601.104  Issuance.


<R05>
1601.104-1  Publication and code arrangement.

    (a) The FEHBAR and its subsequent changes are published in
    (1) Daily issues of the Federal Register; and
    (2) Cumulative form of the Code of Federal Regulations.
    (b) The FEHBAR is issued as chapter 16 of title 48 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations.


<R05>
1601.104-2  Arrangement of regulation.

    (a) General. The FEHBAR conforms with the arrangement and numbering 
system prescribed by FAR 1.104. However, when a FAR part or subpart is 
adequate for use without further OPM implementation or supplementation, 
there will be no corresponding FEHBAR part, subpart, etc. The FEHBAR is 
to be used in conjunction with the FAR and the order for use is:
    (1) FAR;
    (2) FEHBAR.
    (b) Citation. (1) In formal documents, such as legal briefs, 
citation of chapter 16 material that has been published in the Federal 
Register will be to title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
    (2) In informal documents, any section of chapter 16 may be 
identified as ``FEHBAR'' followed by the section number.

         Subpart 1601.3--Agency Acquisition Regulation (FEHBAR)


<R05>
1601.301  Policy.

    (a) Procedures, contract clauses, and other aspects of the 
acquisition process for contracts in the FEHBP shall be consistent with 
the principles of the FAR. Changes to the FAR that are otherwise 
authorized by statute or applicable regulation, dictated by the 
practical realities associated with the unique nature of health care 
procurements, or necessary to satisfy specific needs of the Office of 
Personnel Management shall be implemented as amendments to the FEHBAR 
and published in the Federal Register, or as deviations to the FAR in 
accordance with FAR subpart 1.4.
    (b) Internal procedures, instructions, and guides that are necessary 
to clarify or implement the FEHBAR within OPM may be issued by agency 
officials specifically designated by the Director, OPM. Normally, such 
designations will be specified in the OPM Administrative Manual, which 
is routinely available to agency employees and will be made available to 
interested outside parties upon request. Clarifying or implementing 
procedures, instructions, and guides issued pursuant to this section of 
the FEHBAR must--
    (1) Be consistent with the policies and procedures contained in this 
regulation as implemented and supplemented from time to time; and

1602.170-10  Letter of credit.

    Letter of credit means the method by which certain carriers, and 
their underwriters if authorized, receive recurring premium payments and 
contingency reserve payments by drawing against a commitment (certified 
by a responsible OPM official) which specifies a dollar amount 
available. For each carrier participating in the letter of credit 
arrangement for payment under this part, the terms ``carrier reserves,'' 
and ``special reserves'' include any balance in the carrier's letter of 
credit account.

1602.170-13  Similarly sized subscriber groups.

    (a) Similarly sized subscriber groups (SSSGs) are a comprehensive 
medical plan carrier's two employer groups that:
    (1) As of the date specified by OPM in the rate instructions, have a 
subscriber enrollment closest to the FEHBP subscriber enrollment; and,
    (2) Use any rating method other than retrospective experience 
rating; and,
    (3) Meet the criteria specified in the rate instructions issued by 
OPM.
    (b) Any group with which an FEHB carrier enters into an agreement to 
provide health care services is a potential SSSG (including separate 
lines of business, government entities, groups that have multi-year 
contracts, and groups having point-of-service products).
    (c) Exceptions to the general rule stated in paragraph (b) of this 
section are (and the following groups must be excluded from SSSG 
consideration):
    (1) Groups the carrier rates by the method of retrospective 
experience rating;
    (2) Groups consisting of the carrier's own employees;
    (3) Medicaid groups, Medicare groups, and groups that have only a 
stand alone benefit (such as dental only);
    (4) A purchasing alliance whose rate-setting is mandated by the 
State or local government.
    (d) OPM shall determine the FEHBP rate by selecting the lower of the 
two rates derived by using rating methods consistent with those used to 
derive the SSSG rates.

      Subpart 1603.70--Misleading, Deceptive, or Unfair Advertising


<R05>
1603.7001  Policy.

    (a) OPM prepares and distributes or makes available to Federal 
employees and annuitants a comparison booklet which presents summary 
information and a benefits brochure which details benefits, limitations, 
and premium rates for all participating plans. OPM does not encourage, 
support, or reimburse participating carriers for the costs of 
advertisements. However, while OPM believes that advertising is 
unnecessary, it recognizes that the decision to use advertising rests 
with each carrier.

[[Page 108]]

    (b) OPM discourages advertising that is misleading or deceptive. 
This includes advertising that is directed at other carriers' plans 
participating in the Program and which uses incomplete or inappropriate 
comparisons or disparaging or minimizing techniques. Such unfair 
practices are prejudicial to the interests of the vast majority of 
carriers whose advertising is fair and accurate.
    (c) Failure to conform to the requirements of this subpart shall be 
a material breach of the contract and may result in withdrawal of 
approval to continue participation in the FEHB Program.

1603.7002  Additional guidelines.

    Any advertisements which identify a carrier's participation in the 
FEHBP shall--
    (a) Be limited to the merits of the carrier's FEHBP plan and shall 
be limited to factual statements of the benefits and rates offered by 
that plan. The official document for benefit and rate comparisons among 
FEHBP plans is the comparison chart issued by OPM.
    (b) Not use the FEHBP logo.
    (c) Recognize that the officially approved plan brochure is the sole 
contractual statement of benefits, limitations, and exclusions. All 
advertisements that in any way discuss plan benefits shall contain the 
following statement:
    This is a summary (or brief description) of the features of the 
(plan's name). Before making a final decision, please read the plan's 
officially approved brochure, (brochure number). All benefits are 
subject to the definitions, limitations, and exclusions set forth in the 
official brochure.
    (d) Set forth the rates for the plan, if the advertisements discuss 
benefits.
    (e) Not give instructions on enrollment. Statements on enrollment 
procedures, requirements, or eligibility shall be limited to those such 
as:
    To sign up, fill out a Health Benefits Registration Form (Standard 
Form 2809) from your personnel office indicating the enrollment you 
want:
    The enrollment codes for (plan's name) are:
      Self Only ____________ Enrollment Code____________
      Self and Family ____________ Enrollment Code ____________
    The form must then be returned to your personnel office before the 
(date) deadline. Your (plan's name) coverage will begin the first pay 
period in January, (year). If you are a retired Federal employee and 
need forms, contact the Office of Personnel Management at P.O. Box 809,

1609.470  Notification of Debarment, Suspension, and Ineligibility.

    (FAR) 48 CFR, part 9, subpart 9.4 is supplemented as set out in the 
certification required in 1609.471 by converting the FAR ``offeror's'' 
certification at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.209-5 into a carrier's certification. 
This change reflects the FEHBP's statutory exemption from competitive 
bidding (5 U.S.C. 8902), which obviates the issuance of solicitations.


<R05>
1609.471  Contractor certification.

    All FEHBP carriers and applicant carriers are required to submit the 
following certification. Applicant carriers must submit the 
certification prior to OPM's determination on the application for 
approval to participate in the FEHBP. Current carriers must submit the 
certification once, along with their benefit and rate proposals for the 
1995 contract year.

  Debarment, Suspension, Proposed Debarment, and Other Responsibility 
                                 Matters

    The Carrier certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, 
that--
    (a) The Carrier and/or any of its Principals--
    (1) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for 
debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any 
Federal agency;
    (2) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a 3-year period preceding this 
certification, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered 
against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in 
connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public 
(Federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal 
or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or 
commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or 
destruction of records, making false statements, or receiving stolen 
property; and
    (3) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise 
criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission 
of any of the offenses enumerated in subdivision (a)(2) of this clause.
    (4) The Carrier has ( ) has not ( ), within a 3-year period 
preceding this certification, had one or more contracts terminated for 
default by any Federal agency.
    (b) Principals, for the purposes of this certification, means 
officers; directors; owners;

[[Page 111]]

partners; and persons having primary management or supervisory 
responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant 
manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business segment, and 
similar positions).
    This certification concerns a matter within the jurisdiction of an 
agency of the United States and the making of a false, fictitious, or 
fraudulent certification may render the Carrier subject to prosecution 
under section 1001, title 18, United States Code.
    (c) The Carrier shall provide immediate written notice to the 
Contracting Officer if, at any time, the Carrier learns that its 
certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by 
reason of changed circumstances.
    (d) A Carrier's certification that any of the actions mentioned in 
the certification exists will not necessarily result in termination of 
the contract. However, the certification, or the Carrier's failure to 
provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting 
Officer, will be considered in connection with a determination of the 
Carrier's responsibility under subpart 1609.70, Minimum Standards for 
Health Benefits Carriers.
    (e) Nothing contained in the certification shall be construed to 
require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good 
faith, the certification required by this section. The knowledge and 
information of the Carrier is not required to exceed that which is 
normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of 
business dealings.
    (f) The certification in this section is a material representation 
of fact upon which reliance is placed by the Contracting Officer. If it 
is later determined that the Carrier knowingly rendered an erroneous 
certification, in addition to other remedies available to the 
Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract for 
default.

<R04>
     Subpart 1609.70--Minimum Standards for Health Benefits Carriers


<R05>
1609.7001  Minimum standards for health benefits carriers.

    (a) The carrier of an approved health benefits plan shall meet the 
requirements of chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code; part 890 of 
title 5, Code of Federal Regulations; chapter 1 of title 48, Code of 
Federal Regulations, and the following standards. The carrier shall 
continue to meet the requirements of chapter 89 of title 5, United 
States Code, and the standards cited in this paragraph while under 
contract with OPM. Failure to meet these requirements and standards is 
cause for OPM's withdrawal of approval of the health benefits carrier 
and termination of the contract in accordance with 5 CFR 890.204.
    (1) It must be lawfully engaged in the business of supplying health 
benefits.
    (2) It must have, in the judgement of OPM, the financial resources 
and experience in the field of health benefits to carry out its 
obligations under the plan.
    (3) It must keep such reasonable financial and statistical records, 
and furnish such reasonable financial and statistical reports with 
respect to the plan, as may be requested by OPM.
    (4) It must permit representatives of OPM and of the General 
Accounting Office to audit and examine its records and accounts which 
pertain, directly or indirectly, to the plan at such reasonable times 
and places as may be designated by OPM or the General Accounting Office.
    (5) It must accept, subject to adjustment for error or fraud, in 
payment of its charges for health benefits for all enrollees in its 
plan, the enrollment charges received by the Employees Health Benefits 
(EHB) Fund less amounts set aside for the administrative and contingency 
reserves prescribed in 5 CFR 890.503. OPM makes available or pays the 
amounts within 30 days of receipt by the EHB Fund.
    (6) A carrier that is an employee organization must continue 
coverage, without requirement of membership, of any eligible survivor 
annuitants, former spouses continuing coverage with the carrier under 5 
CFR 890.803, children temporarily continuing coverage with the carrier 
under 5 CFR 890.1103(a)(2), or former spouses temporarily continuing 
coverage with the carrier under 5 CFR 890.1103(a)(3).
    (7) It must timely submit to OPM a properly completed and signed 
novation or change-of-name agreement in accordance with subpart 1642.12 
of this chapter.

[[Page 112]]

    (b) In addition to the standards in paragraph (a) of this section, 
the carrier must perform the contract in accordance with prudent 
business practices. A carrier's sustained poor business practice in the 
management or administration of a health benefits plan is cause for 
OPM's withdrawal of approval of the health benefits carrier and 
termination of the carrier's contract. Prudent business practices 
include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (1) Timely compliance with OPM instructions and directives.
    (2) Legal and ethical business and health care practices.
    (3) Compliance with the terms of the FEHB contract, regulations and 
statutes.
    (4) Timely and accurate adjudication of claims or rendering of 
medical services.
    (5) A system for accounting for costs incurred under the contract, 
when required, which includes segregating and pricing FEHB medical 
utilization and allocating indirect and administrative costs in a 
reasonable and equitable manner.
    (6) Accurate accounting reports of actual, allowable, allocable, and 
reasonable costs incurred in the administration of the contract.
    (7) Application of performance standards for assuring contract 
quality as required by 1646.270(d).
    (8) Establishment and maintenance of a system of internal control 
that provides reasonable assurance that:
    (i) The provision and payments of benefits and other expenses are in 
compliance with legal, regulatory, and contractual guidelines;
    (ii) FEHB funds, property, and other assets are safeguarded against 
waste, loss, unauthorized use, or misappropriation; and,
    (iii) Data are accurately and fairly disclosed in all reports 
required by OPM.
    (c) The following types of activities are examples of poor business 
practices which adversely affect the health benefits carrier's 
responsibility under its contract. A pattern of poor conduct or evidence 
of misconduct in these areas is cause for OPM to withdraw approval of 
the carrier:
    (1) Presenting false claims by charging expenses to the contract 
which according to the contract terms are not chargeable to the 
contract;
    (2) Using fraudulent or unethical business or health care practices 
or otherwise displaying a lack of business integrity or honesty;
    (3) Repeatedly and knowingly providing false or misleading 
information in the rate setting process;
    (4) Repeated failure to comply with OPM instructions and directives;
    (5) Having an accounting system that is incapable of separately 
accounting for costs incurred under the contract and/or that lacks the 
internal controls necessary to fulfill the terms of the contract; and
    (6) Failure to assure that the plan provides properly paid or denied 
claims, or providing medical services which are inconsistent with 
standards of good medical practice.
    (d) The Director or his or her designee will determine whether to 
propose withdrawal of approval and hold a hearing based on the 
seriousness of the carrier's actions and its proposed method to effect 
corrective action.

<R05>
1615.170  Negotiation authority.

    The authority to negotiate FEHBP contracts is conferred by 5 U.S.C. 
8902.


<R04>
  Subpart 1615.4--Solicitations and Receipt of Proposals and Quotations


<R05>
1615.401  Applicability.

    FAR subpart 15.4 has no practical application to the FEHBP because 
OPM does not issue solicitations. Eligible contractors (i.e., qualified 
health benefits carriers) are identified in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 
8903. Offerors voluntarily come forth in accordance with procedures 
provided in 5 CFR part 890.


<R04>
                    Subpart 1615.6--Source Selection


<R05>
1615.602  Applicability.

    FAR subpart 15.6 has no practical application to the FEHBP because 
prospective contractors (carriers) are considered for inclusion in the 
FEHBP in accordance with criteria provided in 5 U.S.C. chapter 89 and 5 
CFR part 890 rather than on the basis of competition between prospective 
carriers.


<R04>
                    Subpart 1615.8--Price Negotiation


<R05>
1615.802  Policy.

    Pricing of FEHB contracts is governed by 5 U.S.C. 8902(i), 5 U.S.C. 
8906, and other applicable law. FAR subpart 15.8 shall be implemented by 
applying the policies and procedures--to the extent practicable--as 
follows:
    (a) For both experience rated and community rated contracts for 
which the FEHBP premiums for the contract term will be less than 
$500,000, OPM shall not require the carrier to provide cost or pricing 
data in the rate proposal for the following contract term.
    (b) Cost analysis shall be used for contracts where premiums and 
subscription income are determined on the basis of experience rating.

[[Page 114]]

    (c)(1) A combination of cost and price analysis shall be used for 
contracts where premiums and subscription income are based on community 
rates. For contracts for which the FEHBP premiums for the contract term 
will be less than $500,000, OPM shall not require the carrier to provide 
cost or pricing data. The carrier must submit only a rate proposal and 
abbreviated utilization data for the applicable contract year. OPM will 
evaluate the proposed rates by performing a basic reasonableness test on 
the information submitted. Rates failing this test will be subject to 
further review.
    (2) For contracts with fewer than 1,500 enrollee contracts for which 
the FEHBP premiums for the contract term will be $500,000 or more, OPM 
shall require the carrier to submit its rate proposal, utilization data, 
and the certificate of accurate cost or pricing data required in 
1615.804-70. In addition, OPM shall require the carrier to complete the 
proposed rates form containing cost and pricing data, and the Community 
Rate Questionnaire, but shall not require the carrier to send these 
documents to OPM. The carrier shall keep the documents on file for 
periodic auditor and actuarial review in accordance with 1652.204-70. 
OPM shall perform a basic reasonableness test on the data submitted. 
Rates that do not pass this test shall be subject to further OPM review.
    (3) For contracts with 1,500 or more enrollee contracts for which 
the FEHBP premiums for the contract term will be at least $500,000, OPM 
shall require the carrier to provide the data and methodology used to 
determine the FEHBP rates. OPM shall also require the data and 
methodology used to determine the rates for the carrier's similarly 
sized subscriber groups. The carrier shall provide cost or pricing data 
required by OPM in its rate instructions for the applicable contract 
period. OPM shall evaluate the data to ensure that the rate is 
reasonable and consistent with the requirements in this chapter. If 
necessary, OPM may require the carrier to provide additional 
documentation.
    (4) Contracts shall be subject to a downward price adjustment if OPM 
determines that the Federal group was charged more than it would have 
been charged using a methodology consistent with that used for the 
SSSGs. Such adjustments shall be based on the lower of the two rates 
determined by using the methodology (including discounts) the Carrier 
used for the two SSSGs.
    (5) FEHBP community rated carriers shall comply with SSSG criteria 
provided by OPM in the rate instructions for the applicable contract 
period.
    (d) The application of FAR 15.802(b)(2) should not be construed to 
prohibit the consideration of preceding year surpluses or deficits in 
carrier-held reserves in the rate adjustments for subsequent year 
renewals of contracts based, in whole or in part, on cost analysis.

1615.802  Policy.

    Pricing of FEHB contracts is governed by 5 U.S.C. 8902(i), 5 U.S.C. 
8906, and other applicable law. FAR subpart 15.8 shall be implemented by 
applying the policies and procedures--to the extent practicable--as 
follows:
    (a)(1) Cost analysis shall be used for contracts where premiums and 
subscription income are determined on the basis of experience rating.
    (2) The application of FAR 15.802(b)(2) should not be construed to 
prohibit the consideration of preceding year surpluses or deficits in 
carrier-held reserves in the rate adjustments for subsequent year 
renewals of contracts based on cost analysis.
    (b)(1) Price analysis for contracts where premiums and subscription 
income are based on community rates (market prices). For contracts with 
fewer than 1,500 FEHBP subscribers, OPM may rely on a basic 
reasonableness test in combination with a carrier's representation that 
the market price submitted on SF 1412, Claim for Exemption from 
Submission of Certified Cost or Pricing Data, is based on the price 
offered to its similarly sized subscriber groups (see FEHBAR 1602.170-
11).
    (2) For contracts with 1,500 FEHBP subscribers or more and for 
contracts with fewer than 1,500 FEHBP subscribers that do not use the SF 
1412, OPM shall require that the plan provide the data and methodology 
used to determine the FEHBP rates. OPM shall also

[[Page 115]]

require the data and methodology used to determine the rates for the 
plan's similarly sized subscriber groups.
    (3) Contracts will be subject to a downward price adjustment if OPM 
determines that the Federal group was charged more than it would have 
been charged using a methodology consistent with that used for the 
SSSGs. Such adjustments will be based on the lowest rates determined for 
the Federal group using the methodology (including discounts) for the 
two SSSGs.
    (4) FEHBP community rated carriers shall comply with SSSG criteria 
provided annually by OPM in the rate instructions for the applicable 
contract period.

                         Subpart 1615.9--Profit

1615.902  Policy.

    (a) OPM will determine the profit or fee prenegotiation objective 
(service charge) portion of FEHBP contracts by use of a weighted 
guidelines structured approach when the pricing of such contracts is 
determined by cost analysis. The service charge so determined shall be 
the total service charge that may be negotiated for the contract and 
shall encompass any service charge (whether entitled service charge, 
profit, fee, contribution to reserves or surpluses, or any other title) 
that may have been negotiated by the prime contractor with any 
subcontractor or underwriter.
    (b) OPM will not guarantee a minimum service charge.

1615.905  Profit analysis factors.

    (a) OPM contracting officers will apply a weighted guidelines method 
in developing the service charge prenegotiation objective for FEHBP 
contracts. The following factors as defined in FAR 15.905-1 will be 
applied to

[[Page 117]]

projected incurred claims and allowable administrative expenses:
    (1) Contractor performance. OPM will consider such elements as the 
accurate and timely processing of benefit claims and the volume and 
validity of disputed claims as measures of economical and efficient 
contract performance. This factor will be judged apart from the 
contractor's basic responsibility for contract performance and will be a 
measure of the extent and nature of the contractor's contribution to the 
FEHBP through the application of managerial expertise and effort. 
Evidence of effective contract performance will receive a plus weight, 
and poor performance or failure to comply with contract terms and 
conditions a negative weight. Innovations of benefit to the FEHBP 
generally a plus weight, documented inattention or indifference to cost 
control a negative weight.
    (2) Contract cost risk. OPM will consider such underwriting elements 
as the availability of margins, group size, enrollment demographics and 
fluctuation, and the probability of conversion and adverse selection, as 
well as the extent of financial assistance the carrier renders to the 
contract, in assessing the degree of cost responsibility and associated 
risk assumed by the contractor as a factor in negotiating profit. It 
should be noted that the ``loss carry forward basis'' of experience 
rated group insurance practices limits this factor in an overall 
determination of profit. This factor is intended to provide profit 
opportunities commensurate with the contractor's share of cost risks 
only, taking into account such elements as the adequacy and reliability 
of data for estimating costs, etc., offset by the ``loss carry forward 
basis'' of experience rating.
    (3) Federal socioeconomic programs. OPM will consider documented 
evidence of successful, contractor-initiated efforts to support such 
Federal socioeconomic programs as drug and substance abuse deterrents, 
and other concerns of the type enumerated in FAR 15.905-1(c) as a factor 
in negotiating profit. This factor will be related to the quality of the 
contractor's policies and procedures and the extent of unusual effort or 
achievement demonstrated. Evidence of effective support of Federal 
socioeconomic programs will receive a plus weight; poor support will 
receive a negative weight.
    (4) Capital investments. This factor is generally not applicable to 
FEHBP contracts because facilities capital cost of money may be an 
allowable administrative expense. Generally, this factor shall be given 
a weight of zero. However, special purpose facilities or investments 
costs of direct benefit to the FEHBP that are not recoverable as 
allowable or allocable administrative expenses may be taken into account 
in assigning a plus weight.
    (5) Cost control. OPM will consider contractor-initiated efforts 
such as improved benefit design, cost-sharing features, innovative peer 
review, or other professional cost containment efforts as a factor in 
negotiating profit. This factor shall be used to reward contractors with 
additional profit opportunities for self-initiated efforts to control 
contract costs.
    (6) Independent development. OPM will consider any profit 
opportunities that may be directly related to relevant independent 
efforts such as the development of a unique and enhanced customer 
support system that is of demonstrated value to the FEHBP and for which 
developmental costs have not been recovered directly or indirectly 
through allowable administrative expenses. This factor will be used to 
provide additional profit opportunities based upon an assessment of the 
contractor's investment and risk in developing techniques, methods, 
practices, etc., having viability to the program at large. Improvements 
and innovations recognized and rewarded under any of the other profit 
factors cannot be considered.
    (b) The weight ranges for each factor to be used in the weighted 
guidelines approach are set forth below:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
               Profit factor                   Weight ranges (percent)  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Contractor performance.................  -.2 to +.45.                
2. Contract cost risk*....................  +.02 to +.2.

6. Independent development................  0 to +.03.                  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
*The contract cost risk factor is subdivided into two parts: group size 
  (.02 to .10) and other risk elements (0 to .10). With respect to the  
  group size element, subweights should be assigned as follows:

<R05>
1624.104  Contract clause.

    Records retained by FEHBP carriers on Federal subscribers and 
members of their families serve the carriers' own commercial function of 
paying health benefits claims and are not maintained to accomplish an 
agency function of OPM. Consequently, the records do not fall within the 
provisions of the Privacy Act. Nevertheless, OPM recognizes the need for 
carriers to keep certain records confidential. The clause at 1652.224-70 
shall be inserted in all FEHBP contracts.

<R04>
         Subpart 1631.2--Contracts With Commercial Organizations


<R05>
1631.200  Scope of subpart.

    The cost principles under this subpart apply only to contracts in 
which premiums and subscription income are determined on the basis of 
experience rating, in which cost analysis is performed, or in which 
price is determined on the basis of actual costs incurred.


<R05>
1631.201-70  FEHBP credits.

    The provisions of FAR 31.201-5 shall apply to income, rebates, 
allowances, and other credits resulting from benefit payments that 
include, but are not limited to--
    (a) Coordination of benefit refunds;
    (b) Hospital year-end settlements;
    (c) Uncashed and returned checks;
    (d) Utilization review refunds;
    (e) Refunds attributable to litigation with subscribers or providers 
of health services; and
    (f) Erroneous benefit payment, overpayment, and duplicate payment 
recoveries.


<R05>
1631.203-70  FEHBP General and Administrative (G&A) expenses.

    The provisions of FAR 31.203 apply to the allocation of indirect 
costs by means of a ``dividend or retention formula.''


<R05>
1631.205    Selected costs.


<R05>
1631.205-41  Taxes.

    5 U.S.C. 8909(f)(1) prohibits the imposition of taxes, fees, or 
other monetary payment, directly or indirectly, on FEHB premiums by any 
State, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or 
by any political subdivision or other governmental authority of those 
entities. Therefore, FAR 31.205-41 is modified to include those taxes as 
unallowable costs. The prohibited payments, referred to elsewhere in 
these regulations as ``premium taxes,'' applies to all payments directed 
by States or municipalities, regardless of how they may be titled,

[[Page 121]]

to whom they must be paid, or the purpose for which they are collected, 
and it applies to all forms of direct and indirect measurements on FEHBP 
premiums, however modified, to include cost per contract or enrollee, 
with the sole exception of a tax on net income or profit, if that tax, 
fee, or payment is applicable to a broad range of business activity.
[56 FR 57496, Nov. 12, 1991]


<R05>
1631.205-70  FEHBP public relations and advertising costs.

    (a) The cost of media messages that are directed at advising current 
FEHBP subscribers on how to obtain benefits shall be an allowable 
expense within the meaning of FAR 31.205-1 because this service is 
directly related to performance of the FEHBP contract. If there is any 
question about the allowability of such a cost, the carrier may request 
advance approval regarding the content and cost of the message.
    (b) Costs of media messages not provided for in paragraph (a) of 
this section are allowable if the content is specifically approved by 
the contracting officer and all of the following criteria are met:
    (1) The primary effect of the message is to disseminate information 
on health care cost containment or preventive health care;
    (2) The costs of the carrier's messages are allocated to all 
underwritten and non-underwritten lines of business; and
    (3) The contracting officer approves the total dollar amount of the 
carrier's messages to be charged to the FEHBP in advance of the contract 
year.
    (c) Costs of messages that are intended to, or which have the 
primary effect of, calling favorable attention to the carrier (or 
subcontractor) for the purpose of enhancing its overall image or selling 
its health plan are not allowable.


<R05>
1631.205-71  FEHBP bad debts.

    Erroneous benefit payments are not automatically disallowed by FAR 
31.205-3.


<R05>
1631.205-72  FEHBP compensation for personal services.

    Overtime on an FEHBP contract would normally meet the condition 
specified in FAR 22.103. Premiums for overtime, extra-pay shifts, and 
multi-shifts meeting the specified conditions shall be allowed without 
prior approval.


<R05>
1631.205-73  FEHBP interest expense.

    (a) Interest charges incurred in the administration of FEHBP 
contracts are not allowable in accordance with FAR 31.205-20. However, 
interest charges that are associated with the carrier's investment of 
FEHBP account funds are not considered administrative costs and may be 
allowable under very limited circumstances if all of the following 
criteria are met:
    (1) Borrowing is limited to the positive balance of the carrier's 
entire FEHBP investment portfolio;
    (2) FEHBP funds are tied up in long-term securities;
    (3) Liquidation of long-term securities would cost more than the 
cost of the interest;
    (4) The interest rates charged are at or below current market rates; 
and
    (5) Advance written approval of the contracting officer is obtained 
before such costs are incurred.
    (b) The carrier must demonstrate on a case-by-case basis that 
borrowing rather than cashing in long-term investments shall actually 
result in cost savings to the FEHB Program. Satisfactory demonstration 
of cost savings is a prerequisite to contracting officer approval of the 
interest cost as a charge to the contract.
    (c) If the interest charge is allowed, the risk factor in the 
service charge will be adjusted downward so that the carrier does not 
recover interest costs through both the service charge and an allowance 
under this paragraph.


<R05>
1631.205-74  FEHBP losses on other contracts.

    FAR 31.205-23 shall not be construed to prohibit the application of 
the normal ``loss carry forward'' principle that is fundamental to 
continuing insurance contracts that are based on experience rating.

[[Page 122]]


<R05>
1631.205-75  Selling costs.

    (a) FAR 31.205-38 is modified to eliminate from allowable costs 
those costs related to sales promotion and the payment of sales 
commissions fees or salaries to employees or outside commercial or 
selling agencies for enrolling Federal subscribers in a particular FEHB 
plan.
    (b) Selling costs are allowable costs to FEHBP contracts to the 
extent that they are necessary for conducting annual contract 
negotiations with the Government and for liaison activities necessary 
for ongoing contract administration. Personnel and related travel costs 
are allowable for attendance at Open Season Health fairs and other 
similar activities at which carriers give enrollees information about 
their choices among health plans (but see FAR 31.205-1 `Public relations 
and advertising costs', and The Federal Employees Health Benefits 
Handbook for Personnel and Payroll Offices, Subchapter S2-3(f) 
`Controlling contacts between employees and carriers').
[52 FR 16041, May 1, 1987, as amended at 62 FR 47575, Sept. 10, 1997]

    Effective Date Note: At 62 FR 47575, Sept. 10, 1997 section 
1631.205-75(b), was revised, effective Oct. 10, 1997. For the 
convenience of the user, the superseded text is set forth as follows:

1631.205-75  Selling costs.

                                * * * * *

    (b) Selling costs are allowable costs to FEHBP contracts to the 
extent that they are necessary for conducting annual contract 
negotiations with the Government and for liaison activities necessary 
for ongoing contract administration. Personnel and related travel costs 
are allowable for attendance at Open Season health fairs and other 
similar activities sponsored by Government agencies (but see FAR 31.205-
1 ``Public relations and advertising costs'', and Federal Personnel 
Manual Supplement 890-1, Subchapter S2-3(f) ``Controlling contacts 
between employees and carriers'').


<R05>
1631.205-76  Trade, business, technical, and professional activity costs.

    (a) FEHBP participating plans, carriers, and underwriters shall seek 
the advance written approval of the contracting officer for allowability 
of all or part of the costs associated with trade, business, technical, 
and professional activities (FAR 31.205-43) when the allocable costs of 
such participation to the FEHBP will exceed $1,000 annually and when the 
carrier or underwriter allocates more than 50% of the membership cost of 
a trade, business, technical, or professional organization to the FEHBP.
    (b) When approval of costs for membership in an organization is 
required, the carrier or underwriter must demonstrate conclusively that 
membership in such an organization and participation in its activities 
extend beyond the contractual relationship with OPM, have a reasonable 
relationship to providing care and services to FEHBP enrollees, and that 
the organization is not engaged in activities such as those cited in FAR 
31.205-22 (lobbying costs) for which costs are not allowable.


<R05>
1631.205-77  FEHBP start-up and other nonrecurring costs.

    Precontract costs (FAR 31.205-32) shall be allowed only to the 
extent provided for by advance agreement in accordance with FAR 31.109.


<R05>
1631.205-78  FEHBP printed material costs.

    Unless OPM determines that it is in the best interest of the FEHBP 
to do otherwise, if a carrier orders printed material that is available 
from the Government Printing Office (GPO) under the ``rider system'' 
from another source, the allowable contract charges shall be the lesser 
of the amount actually paid or the cost that would have been incurred 
had the carrier ridden OPM's GPO order.


<R05>
1631.205-79  Mandatory statutory reserves.

    Charges for mandatory statutory reserves are not allowed unless 
provided for in the contract. When the term ``mandatory statutory 
reserve'' is specifically identified as an allowable contract charge 
without further definition or explanation, it means a requirement 
imposed by State law upon the carrier to set aside a specific amount or 
rate of funds into a restricted reserve that is accounted for separately 
from all other reserves and surpluses of the carrier and which may be 
used only with the

[[Page 123]]

specific approval of the State official designated by law to make such 
approvals. The amount chargeable to the contract may not exceed an 
allocable portion of the amount actually set aside. If the statutory 
reserve is no longer required for the purpose for which it was created, 
and these funds become available for the general use of the carrier, a 
pro rata share based upon FEHBP's contribution to the total carrier's 
set aside shall be returned to the FEHBP in accordance with FAR 31.201-
5.


<R05>
1631.205-80  Major subcontractor service charges.

    In a subcontract for enrollment and eligibility determinations, 
administration of claims and payment of benefits, and payment or 
provision of actual health services, and/or assumption of insurance risk 
or underwriting, when costs are determined on the basis of actual costs 
incurred or experience rating, any amount that exceeds the allowable 
cost of the subcontract (whether entitled service charge, profit, fee, 
contribution to reserve, surplus, or any other title) is not allowable 
under the contract. Amounts which exceed allowable costs may be paid to 
a major subcontractor only from the service charge negotiated between 
OPM and the Carrier.

<R05>
1632.170  Recurring premium payments to carriers.

    (a) Recurring payments to carriers of community-rated plans. OPM 
will pay to carriers of community-rated plans the premium payments 
received for the plan less the amounts credited to the contingency and 
administrative reserves. Premium payments will be due and payable not 
later than 30 days after receipt by the Federal Employees Health 
Benefits (FEHB) Fund.
    (b)(1) Recurring payments to carriers of experience-rated plans. OPM 
will make payments on a letter of credit (LOC) basis. Premium payments 
received for the plan, less the amounts credited to the contingency and 
administrative reserves, will be made available for carrier drawdown not 
later than 30 days after receipt by the FEHB Fund. In addition, 
contingency reserve and interest distribution payments will be made 
available for carrier drawdown from the LOC account. Carriers will use 
the LOC account in accordance with guidelines issued by OPM.
    (2) Withdrawals from the LOC account will be made on a checks-
presented basis. Under a checks-presented bases, drawdown on the LOC is 
delayed until the checks issued for FEHB Program disbursements are 
presented to the carrier's bank for payment.
    (3) OPM may grant a waiver of the restriction of LOC disbursements 
to a checks-presented basis if the carrier requests the waiver in 
writing and demonstrates to OPM's satisfaction that the checks-presented 
basis of LOC disbursements will result in significantly increased 
liability under the contract, or that the checks-presented basis of LOC 
disbursements is otherwise clearly and significantly detrimental to the 
operation of the plan. Payments to carriers that have been granted a 
waiver may be made by an alternative payment methodology, subject to OPM 
approval.

<R05>
1632.607  Tax credit.

    FAR 32.607 has no practical application to FEHBP contracts. The 
statutory provisions at 5 U.S.C. 8906(c) and (d) authorize joint 
enrollee and Government contributions to the FEHBP Fund. Because the 
Fund is comprised of contributions by enrollees as well as the 
Government, carriers may not offset debts to the Fund by a tax credit 
which is solely a Government obligation.

1632.770  Contingency reserve payments.

    (a) Payments from the contingency reserve shall be made in 
accordance with 5 CFR 890.503.
    (b) A carrier for an FEHB plan may apply to OPM at any time for a 
payment from the contingency reserve that is in addition to those 
amounts, if any, paid under 5 CFR 890.503(c)(1) through (c)(4), if the 
carrier can show good cause, such as, unexpected adverse claims 
experience. OPM will decide whether to allow the request in whole or in 
part and will advise the carrier of its decision. However, OPM shall not 
unreasonably withhold approval for amounts requested that exceed the 
plan's preferred minimum balance for the contingency reserve.


<R05>
1632.771  Non-commingling of FEHBP funds.

    (a) This section applies to contracts based on cost analysis.
    (b) Carrier or underwriter commingling of FEHBP funds with those 
from other sources makes it difficult to precisely determine FEHBP cash 
balances at any given time or to precisely determine investment income 
attributable to FEHBP invested assets.
    (c) FEHBP funds shall be maintained separately from other cash and 
investments of the carrier or underwriter. Cash and investment balances 
reported on FEHBP Annual Accounting Statements must agree with the 
carrier's books and records.
    (d) This requirement may be waived by the contracting officer in 
accordance with the clause at 1652.232-70 when adequate accounting and 
other controls are in effect. If the requirement is waived, the waiver 
will remain in effect until it is withdrawn by OPM. The waiver shall be 
withdrawn if OPM determines that the accounting controls are no longer 
adequate to properly account for FEHBP funds.

for this subpart.


<R05>
1642.1204  Agreement to recognize a successor in interest (novation agreement).

    (a) (FAR) 48 CFR 42.1204 shall be implemented as provided in this 
section. The contracting officer shall insert the following agreement in 
all FEHBP contracts for use when the contractor's assets or the entire 
portion of the assets pertinent to the performance of the contract, as 
determined by the Government, are transferred.

                           Novation Agreement

    The (insert corporate name) (Transferor), a corporation duly 
organized and existing under the laws of (insert State) with its 
principal office in (insert city, state); the (insert corporate name) 
(Transferee), (if appropriate add ``formerly known as the ______ 
Corporation'') a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws 
of (insert State) with its principal office in (insert city); and the 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (Government) enter into this Agreement 
effective (insert date transfer of assets became effective under 
applicable State law).
    (a) THE PARTIES AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTS:
    (1) The Government, represented by various Contracting Officers of 
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), has entered into Contract 
Number ______ with the Transferor. The term contracts, as used in this 
Agreement, means the contract cited in this paragraph and all other 
contracts and purchase orders, including any and all amendments and 
modifications made between the Government and the Transferor before the 
effective date of this Agreement (whether or not performance and payment 
have been completed and releases executed if the Government or the 
Transferor has any remaining rights, duties, or obligations under these 
contracts and purchase orders).
    (2) As of ____ 19__ (insert date transfer of assets became effective 
under applicable State law), the Transferor has transferred to the 
Transferee all the assets of the Transferor, or the entire portion of 
the Transferor's assets pertinent to performing the contract, as 
determined by OPM, by virtue of a(an) (insert term describing the legal 
transaction involved) between the Transferor and the Transferee.
    (3) The Transferee has acquired all the assets of the Transferor, or 
the entire portion of the Transferor's assets pertinent to performing 
the contract, as determined by OPM, by virtue of the transfer in 
paragraph (a)(1).
    (4) The Transferee has assumed all obligations and liabilities of 
the Transferor pertinent to performing the contract, as determined by 
OPM, by virtue of the transfer in paragraph (a)(1).
    (5) The Transferee is in a position to fully perform all obligations 
that may exist under the contract.
    (6) It is consistent with the Government's interest to recognize the 
Transferee as the successor party to the contract.
    (7) Evidence of the transfer in paragraph (a)(1) has been filed with 
the Government.
    (8) [If applicable:] A certificate dated ____, 19__, signed by the 
Secretary of State of (insert State), to the effect that the corporate 
name of (insert old corporate name) was changed to (insert new corporate 
name) on ____, 19__, has been filed with the Government.
    (b) IN CONSIDERATION OF THESE FACTS, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT BY THIS 
AGREEMENT--
    (1) The Transferor confirms the transfer to the Transferee, and 
waives any claims and rights against the Government or the Federal 
Employees Health Benefits Fund that it now has or may have in the future 
in connection with the contract.

[[Page 127]]

    (2) The Transferee agrees to be bound by and to perform the contract 
in accordance with the conditions contained in the contract. The 
Transferee also assumes all obligations and liabilities of, and all 
claims against, the Transferor pertinent to the contract, as determined 
by OPM, as if the Transferee were the original party to the contract.
    (3) The Transferee ratifies all previous actions taken by the 
Transferor with respect to the contract, with the same force and effect 
as if the action had been taken by the Transferee.
    (4) The Government recognizes the Transferee as the Transferor's 
successor in interest in and to the contract. The Transferee by this

  Subpart 1642.70--Management Agreement (in Lieu of Novation Agreement)


<R05>
1642.7001  Management agreement.

    When it is in the best interest of FEHBP enrollees to continue a 
contract for an interim period after the carrier discontinues its 
operations and has entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (or other 
descriptive term), but before a successor in interest has been 
recognized by OPM, the carrier may submit for OPM approval a Management 
Agreement that enables it to continue a contract through an agreement 
with a third party to administer the day-to-day performance of the 
contract. Examples of situations in which a Management Agreement may be 
accepted by OPM are:
    (a) When a transfer of assets does not meet the criteria for a 
novation;
    (b) While a request for a novation is pending;
    (c) While awaiting a decision on a request for a novation;
    (d) As an interim measure, when the timing of a transfer of assets 
or the timing of a carrier's withdrawal make administration of the 
contract inconvenient;
    (e) When it is not in the interests of the Government to either 
recognize a successor in interest or to immediately

ensure that services acquired under the FEHBP contract conform to the 
contract's quality requirements.
    (b) OPM shall periodically evaluate the contractor's system of 
internal controls under the quality assurance program required by the 
contract and will acknowledge in writing whether or not the system is 
consistent with the requirements set forth in the contract. After the 
initial review, subsequent reviews may be limited to changes in the 
contractor's internal control guidelines. However, a limited review does 
not diminish the contractor's obligation to apply the full internal 
control system.
    (c) OPM will issue specific performance standards for the FEHBP 
contracts and will inform carriers of the applicable performance 
standards prior to negotiations for the contract year. OPM will 
benchmark its standards against standards generally accepted in the

its underwriter, if any, and other subcontractors directly involved in 
the preparation or distribution of such advertising material and shall 
substitute ``Contractor'' or other appropriate reference for the term 
``Carrier.''

accordance with the terms of the contract, or in excess of the 
limitations applicable under this contract; and (3) the Carrier is 
unable to recover such COB overpayments from the Member or the providers 
of services or supplies, the Contracting Officer may allow such amounts

Sec. 1652.204-72  Filing health benefit claims/court review of disputed claims.

    As prescribed in 1604.7101 of this chapter, the following clause 
must be inserted in all FEHB Program contracts.

 Filing Health Benefit Claims/Court Review of Disputed Claims (Mar 1995)

    (a) General. (1) The Carrier resolves claims filed under the Plan. 
All health benefit claims must be submitted initially to the Carrier. If 
the Carrier denies a claim (or a portion of a claim), the covered 
individual may ask the Carrier to reconsider its denial. If the Carrier 
affirms its denial or fails to respond as required by paragraph (b) of 
this clause, the covered individual may ask OPM to review the claim. A 
covered individual must exhaust both the Carrier and OPM review 
processes specified in this clause before seeking judicial review of the 
denied claim.
    (2) This clause applies to covered individuals and to other 
individuals or entities who are acting on the behalf of a covered 
individual and who have the covered individual's specific written 
consent to pursue payment of the disputed claim.
    (b) Time limits for reconsidering a claim. (1) The covered 
individual has 6 months from the date of the notice to the covered 
individual that a claim (or a portion of a claim) was denied by the 
Carrier in which to submit a written request for reconsideration to the 
Carrier. The time limit for requesting reconsideration may be extended 
when the covered individual shows that he or she was prevented by 
circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within 
the time limit.
    (2) The Carrier has 30 days after the date of receipt of a timely-
filed request for reconsideration to:
    (i) Affirm the denial in writing to the covered individual;
    (ii) Pay the bill or provide the service; or
    (iii) Request from the covered individual or provider additional 
information needed to make a decision on the claim. The Carrier must 
simultaneously notify the covered individual of the information 
requested if it requests additional information from a provider. The 
Carrier has 30 days after the date the information is received to affirm 
the denial in writing to the covered individual or pay the bill or 
provide the service. The Carrier must make its decision based on the 
evidence it has if the covered individual or provider does not respond 
within 60 days after the date of the Carrier's notice requesting 
additional information. The Carrier must then send written notice to the 
covered individual of its decision on the claim. The covered individual 
may request OPM review as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this clause if 
the Carrier fails to act within the time limit set forth in this 
paragraph.
    (3) The covered individual may write to OPM and request that OPM 
review the Carrier's decision if the Carrier either affirms its denial 
of a claim or fails to respond to a covered individual's written request 
for reconsideration within the time limit set forth

[[Page 135]]

in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause. The covered individual must submit 
the request for OPM review within the time limit specified in paragraph 
(e)(1) of this clause.
    (4) The Carrier may extend the time limit for a covered individual's 
submission of additional information to the Carrier when the covered 
individual shows he or she was not notified of the time limit or was 
prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from submitting the 
additional information.
    (c) Information required to process requests for reconsideration. 
(1) The covered individual must put the request to the Carrier to 
reconsider a claim in writing and give the reasons, in terms of 
applicable brochure provisions, that the denied claim should have been 
approved.
    (2) If the Carrier needs additional information from the covered 
individual to make a decision, it must:
    (i) Specifically identify the information needed;
    (ii) State the reason the information is required to make a decision 
on the claim;
    (iii) Specify the time limit (60 days after the date of the 
Carrier's request) for submitting the information; and
    (iv) State the consequences of failure to respond within the time 
limit specified, as set out in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (d) Carrier determinations. The Carrier must provide written notice 
to the covered individual of its determination. If the Carrier affirms 
the initial denial, the notice must inform the covered individual of:
    (1) The specific and detailed reasons for the denial;
    (2) The covered individual's right to request a review by OPM; and
    (3) The requirement that requests for OPM review must be received 
within 90 days after the date of the Carrier's denial notice and include 
a copy of the denial notice as well as documents to support the covered 
individual's position.
    (e) OPM review. (1) If the covered individual seeks further review 
of the denied claim, the covered individual must make a request to OPM 
to review the Carrier's decision. Such a request to OPM must be made:
    (i) Within 90 days after the date of the Carrier's notice to the 
covered individual that the denial was affirmed; or
    (ii) If the Carrier fails to respond to the covered individual as 
provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, within 120 days after the 
date of the covered individual's timely request for reconsideration by 
the Carrier; or
    (iii) Within 120 days after the date the Carrier requests additional 
information from the covered individual, or the date the covered 
individual is notified that the Carrier is requesting additional 
information from a provider. OPM may extend the time limit for a covered 
individual's request for OPM review when the covered individual shows he 
or she was not notified of the time limit or was prevented by 
circumstances beyond his or her control from submitting the request for 
OPM review within the time limit.
    (2) In reviewing a claim denied by the Carrier, OPM may:
    (i) Request that the covered individual submit additional 
information;
    (ii) Obtain an advisory opinion from an independent physician;
    (iii) Obtain any other information as may in its judgment be 
required to make a determination; or
    (iv) Make its decision based solely on the information the covered 
individual provided with his or her request for review.
    (3) When OPM requests information from the Carrier, the Carrier must 
release the information within 30 days after the date of OPM's written 
request unless a different time limit is specified by OPM in its 
request.
    (4) Within 90 days after receipt of the request for review, OPM will 
either:
    (i) Give a written notice of its decision to the covered individual 
and the Carrier; or
    (ii) Notify the individual of the status of the review. If OPM does 
not receive requested evidence within 15 days after expiration of the 
applicable time limit in paragraph (e)(3) of this clause, OPM may make 
its decision based solely on information available to it at that time 
and give a written notice of its decision to the covered individual and 
to the Carrier.
    (f) OPM, upon its own motion, may reopen its review if it receives 
evidence that was unavailable at the time of its original decision.
    (g) Court review. (1) A suit to compel enrollment under Sec. 890.102 
of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, must be brought against the 
employing office that made the enrollment decision.
    (2) A suit to review the legality of OPM's regulations under this 
part must be brought against the Office of Personnel Management.
    (3) Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) carriers resolve FEHB 
claims under authority of Federal statute (chapter 89, title 5, United 
States Code). A covered individual may seek judicial review of OPM's 
final action on the denial of a health benefits claim. A legal action to 
review final action by OPM involving such denial of health benefits must 
be brought against OPM and not against the Carrier or the Carrier's 
subcontractors. The recovery in such a suit shall be limited to a court 
order directing OPM to require the Carrier to pay the amount of benefits 
in dispute.
    (4) An action under paragraph (3) of this clause to recover on a 
claim for health benefits:
    (i) May not be brought prior to exhaustion of the administrative 
remedies provided in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this clause;

[[Page 136]]

    (ii) May not be brought later than December 31 of the 3rd year after 
the year in which the care or service was provided; and
    (iii) Will be limited to the record that was before OPM when it 
rendered its decision affirming the Carrier's denial of benefits.

<R05>
1652.215-70  Rate Reduction for Defective Pricing or Defective Cost or Pricing Data.

    As prescribed in 1615.804-72, the following clause shall be inserted 
in FEHBP contracts exceeding the threshold at FAR 15.804-2(a)(1) that 
are based on a combination of cost and price analysis (community rated):

 Rate Reduction for Defective Pricing or Defective Cost or Pricing Data 
                               (Jan 1998)

    (a) If any rate established in connection with this contract was 
increased because (1) the Carrier submitted, or kept in its files in 
support of the FEHBP rate, cost or pricing data that were not complete, 
accurate, or current as certified in the Certificate of Accurate Cost or 
Pricing Data (FEHBAR 1615.804-70); (2) the Carrier submitted, or kept in 
its files in support of the FEHBP rate, cost or pricing data that were 
not accurate as represented in the rate proposal documents; (3) the 
Carrier developed FEHBP rates with a rating methodology and structure 
inconsistent with that used to develop rates for similarly sized 
subscriber groups (see FEHBAR 1602.170-13) as certified in the 
Certificate of Accurate Cost or Pricing Data for Community Rated 
Carriers; or (4) the Carrier submitted or, or kept in its files in 
support of the FEHBP rate, data or information of any description that 
were not complete, accurate, and current--then, the rate shall be 
reduced in the amount by which the price was increased because of the 
defective data or information.
    (b)(1) If the Contracting Officer determines under paragraph (a) of 
this clause that a price or cost reduction should be made, the Carrier 
agrees not to raise the following matters as a defense:
    (i) The Carrier was a sole source supplier or otherwise was in a 
superior bargaining position and thus the price of the contract would 
not have been modified even if accurate, complete, and current cost or 
pricing data had been submitted or maintained and identified.
    (ii) The Contracting Officer should have known that the cost or 
pricing data in issue were defective even though the Carrier took no 
affirmative action to bring the character of the data to the attention 
of the Contracting Officer.
    (iii) The contract was based on an agreement about the total cost of 
the contract and there was no agreement about the cost of each item 
procured under the contract.
    (iv) The Carrier did not submit or keep in its files a Certificate 
of Current Cost or Pricing Data.
    (2)(i) Except as prohibited by subdivision (b)(2)(ii) of this 
clause, an offset in an amount determined appropriate by the Contracting 
Officer based upon the facts shall be allowed against the amount of a 
contract price reduction if--
    (A) The Carrier certifies to the Contracting Officer that, to the 
best of the Carrier's knowledge and belief, the Carrier is entitled to 
the offset in the amount requested; and
    (B) The Carrier proves that the cost or pricing data were available 
before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of 
the modification) and that the data were not submitted before such date.
    (ii) An offset shall not be allowed if--
    (A) The understated data was known by the Carrier to be understated 
when the Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data was signed; or
    (B) The Government proves that the facts demonstrate that the 
contract price would not have increased in the amount to be offset even 
if the available data had been submitted before the date of agreement on 
price.
    (c) When the Contracting Officer determines that the rates shall be 
reduced and the Government is thereby entitled to a refund, the Carrier 
shall be liable to and shall pay the FEHB Fund at the time the 
overpayment is repaid--
    (1) Simple interest on the amount of the overpayment from the date 
the overpayment was paid from the FEHB Fund to the Carrier until the 
date the overcharge is liquidated. In calculating the amount of interest 
due, the quarterly rate determinations by the Secretary of the Treasury 
under the authority of 26 U.S.C. 6621(a)(2) applicable to the periods 
the overcharge was retained by the Carrier shall be used; and,
    (2) A penalty equal to the amount of overpayment, if the Carrier 
knowingly submitted cost or pricing data which was incomplete, 
inaccurate, or noncurrent.

1652.215-70  Rate Reduction for Defective Pricing or Defective Cost or 
          Pricing Data.

    As prescribed in 1615.804-72, the following clause shall be inserted 
in contracts based on established market price:

 Rate Reduction for Defective Pricing or Defective Cost or Pricing Data 
                               (Oct 1994)

    If any rate established in connection with this contract was 
increased because (1) the Carrier furnished cost or pricing data that 
were not complete, accurate, or current as certified in the Certificate 
of Accurate Pricing for Community Rated Plans (FEHBAR 1615.804-70); (2) 
the Carrier furnished pricing data that were not accurate as represented 
on the Claim for Exemption from Submission of Certified Cost or Pricing 
Data (SF 1412); (3) the Carrier developed FEHBP rates with a rating 
methodology and structure inconsistent with that used to develop rates 
for similarly sized subscriber groups (see FEHBAR 1602.170-11) as 
certified in the Certificate of Accurate Pricing for Community Rated 
Plans or represented in the Supplemental Representation for SF 1412; or 
(4) the Carrier furnished data or information of any description that 
were not complete, accurate, and current--then, the rate shall be 
reduced in the amount by which the price was increased because of the 
defective data or information. When the Contracting Office determines 
that the Carrier did not charge a market price and the Government is 
entitled to a refund, the refund shall bear simple interest from the 
date the overcharge was paid by the Government to the Carrier until the 
date the overcharge is liquidated. In calculating the amount of interest 
due, the quarterly rate determinations by the Secretary of the Treasury 
under the authority of 26 U.S.C. 6621(a)(2) applicable to the periods 
the overcharge was retained by the Carrier shall be used.

1652.215-71  Investment Income.

    As prescribed in 1615.805-71, the following clause shall be inserted 
in all FEHBP contracts based on cost analysis:

                      Investment Income (Jan 1998)

    (a) The Carrier shall invest and reinvest all FEHB funds on hand 
that are in excess of the funds needed to promptly discharge the 
obligations incurred under this contract. The Carrier shall seek to 
maximize investment income with prudent consideration to the safety and 
liquidity of investments.
    (b) All investment income earned on FEHB funds shall be credited to 
the Special Reserve on behalf of the FEHBP.
    (c) When the Contracting Officer concludes that the Carrier failed 
to comply with paragraph (a) or (b) of this clause, the Carrier shall 
credit the Special Reserve with investment income that would have been 
earned, at the rate(s) specified in paragraph (f) of this clause, had it 
not been for the Carrier's noncompliance. ``Failed to comply with 
paragraph (a) or (b)'' means: (1) Making any charges against the 
contract which are not allowable, allocable, or reasonable; or (2) 
failing to credit any income due the contract and/or failing to place 
excess funds, including subscription income and payments from OPM not 
needed to discharge promptly the obligations incurred under the 
contract, refunds, credits, payments, deposits, investment income 
earned, uncashed checks, or other amounts owed the Special Reserve, in 
income producing investments and accounts.
    (d) Investment income lost as a result of unallowable, unallocable, 
or unreasonable charges against the contract shall be paid from the 1st 
day of the contract term following the contract term in which the 
unallowable charge was made and shall end on the earlier of: (1) The 
date the amounts are returned to the Special Reserve (or the Office of 
Personnel Management); (2) the date specified by the Contracting 
Officer; or, (3) the date of the Contracting Officer's Final Decision.
    (e) Investment income lost as a result of failure to credit income 
due the contract or failure to place excess funds in income producing 
investments and accounts shall be paid from the date the funds should 
have been invested or appropriate income was not credited and shall end 
on the earlier of: (1) The date the amounts are returned to the Special 
Reserve (or the Office of Personnel Management); (2) the date specified 
by the Contracting Officer; or, (3) the date of the Contracting 
Officer's Final Decision.
    (f) The Carrier shall credit the Special Reserve for income due in 
accordance with this clause. All lost investment income payable shall 
bear simple interest at the quarterly rate determined by the Secretary 
of the Treasury under the authority of 26 U.S.C. 6621(a)(2) applicable 
to the periods in which the amount becomes due, as provided in 
paragraphs (d) and (e) of this clause.
    (g) The Carrier shall incorporate this clause into agreements with

inserted in all FEHBP contracts based on a combination of cost and price 
analysis (community rated).

               Accounting and Price Adjustment (Jan 1998)

    (a) Annual Accounting Statement. The Carrier, not later than 90 days 
after the end of each contract period, shall furnish to OPM for that 
contract period an accounting of its operations under the contract. The 
accounting shall be in the form prescribed by OPM.
    (b) Adjustment. (1) This contract is community rated as defined in

    (2) The subscription rates agreed to in this contract shall be 
equivalent to the subscription rates given to the carrier's similarly

    (3) If, at the time of the rate reconciliation, the subscription 
rates are found to be lower than the equivalent rates for the lower of 
the two SSSGs, the carrier may include an adjustment to the Federal 
group's rates for the next contract period.
    (4) If, at the time of the rate reconciliation, the subscription 
rates are found to be higher than the equivalent rates for the lower of 
the two SSSGs, the Carrier shall reimburse the Fund, for example, by 
reducing the FEHB rates for the next contract term to reflect the 
difference between the estimated rates and the rates which are derived 
using the methodology of the lower rated SSSG.
    (5) No upward adjustment in the rate established for this contract 
will be allowed or considered by the Government or will be made by the 
Carrier in this or in any other contract period on the basis of actual 
costs incurred, actual benefits provided, or actual size or composition 
of the FEHBP group during this contract period.
    (6) In the event this contract is not renewed, neither the 
Government nor the Carrier shall be entitled to any adjustment or claim

1652.216-70  Accounting and price adjustment.

    As prescribed in 1616.270, the following clause shall be inserted in

               Accounting and Price Adjustment (Jan 1990)

    (a) Annual Accounting Statement. The Carrier, not later than 90 days 
after the end of each contract period, shall furnish to OPM for that

accounting shall be in the form prescribed by OPM.
    (b) Adjustment. (1) This contract is community rated as defined in

    (2) The subscription rates agreed to in this contract are derived

    (3) If, for the contract period, the Carrier establishes an actual 
market price higher than the market price established for this contract 
and the higher market price is actually paid by the similarly sized 
subscriber groups (see FEHBAR 1602.170-11), the Carrier may include an 
adjustment to the next contract period's FEHBP rates to recover the 
difference between the estimated market price and the actual market

market price lower than the market price established for this contract 
and the lower market price is actually paid by similarly sized

the next contract period's FEHB rates to reflect the difference between 
the estimated market price and the actual market price.

will be allowed or considered by the Government or will be made by the

costs incurred, actual benefits provided, or actual size or composition 
of the FEHBP group during this contract period.
    (6) In the event this contract is not renewed, neither the 
Government nor the Carrier shall be entitled to any adjustment or claim 
for the difference between the estimated and the actual market price, 
PMPM capitation or revenue requirement.

1652.216-71  Accounting and Allowable Cost.

    As prescribed in section 1616.7002, the following clause shall be 
inserted in all FEHBP contracts based on cost analysis (experience 
rated).

                Accounting and Allowable Cost (Jan 1991)

    (a) Annual Accounting Statement. (1) The Carrier, not later than the 
date specified by the contract, shall furnish to OPM for that contract 
period an accounting of its operations under the contract. The 
accounting shall be in the form prescribed by OPM and shall include, 
among other things, a Balance Sheet and a Summary Statement of FEHBP 
Financial Operations. The Summary Statement of FEHBP Financial 
Operations shall include the following items for each option provided by 
the contract:
    (i) Subscription income received and accrued (including amounts 
received from the Contingency Reserve);
    (ii) Health benefits charges paid and accrued;
    (iii) Administrative expenses and other charges paid and accrued;
    (iv) Income on investments;
    (v) Other adjustments;
    (vi) Sum of items (i) minus (ii) minus (iii) plus (iv) plus or minus 
(v).
    (2) The Carrier shall have its most recent financial statement and 
that of its underwriter, if any, audited by an accounting firm that 
ascribes to the standards of the American Institute of Certified Public 
Accountants. The report shall be submitted to OPM not later than 180 
days after the end of the contract period.
    (3) Based on the results of either the independent audit or a 
Government audit, the Carrier's annual accounting statements may be (i) 
adjusted by amounts found not to constitute allowable costs; or (ii) 
adjusted for prior overpayments or underpayments.
    (b) Definition of costs. (1) The allowable costs chargeable to the 
contract for a contract period shall be the actual, necessary and 
reasonable amounts incurred with proper justification and accounting 
support, determined in accordance with the terms of this contract, 
subpart 31.2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and subpart 
1631.2 of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Acquisition Regulation 
(FEHBAR) applicable on the first day of the contract period.
    (2) In the absence of specific contract terms to the contrary, 
contract costs shall be classified in accordance with the following 
criteria:
    (i) Benefits. Benefit costs consist of payments made and liabilities 
incurred for covered health care services on behalf of FEHBP 
subscribers, less any refunds, rebates, allowances or other credits 
received.
    (ii) Administrative expenses. Administrative expenses consist of all 
allocable, allowable and reasonable expenses incurred in the 
adjudication of subscriber benefit claims or incurred in the Carrier's 
overall operation of the business. Unless otherwise stated in the 
contract, administrative expenses include, in part: all taxes (excluding 
premium taxes, as provided in section 1631.205-41), insurance and 
reinsurance premiums, medical and dental consultants used in the 
adjudication process, concurrent or managed care review when not billed 
by a health care provider and other forms of utilization review, the 
cost of maintaining eligibility files, legal expenses incurred in the 
litigation of benefit payments and bank charges for letters of credit. 
Administrative expenses exclude the cost of carrier personnel, 
equipment, and facilities directly used in the delivery of health care 
services, which are benefit costs, and the expense of managing the FEHBP 
investment program which is a reduction of investment income earned.
    (iii) Investment income. The Carrier is required to invest and 
reinvest all funds on hand, including any in the Special Reserve or any 
attributable to the reserve for incurred but unpaid claims, which are in 
excess of the funds needed to discharge promptly the obligations 
incurred under the contract. Investment income represents the net amount 
earned by the Carrier after deducting investment expenses as a result of 
investing the FEHBP funds. The direct or allocable indirect expenses 
incurred in managing the investment program, such as consultant or 
management fees are chargeable against the investment income earned.
    (iv) Other charges--(A) Mandatory statutory reserves. Charges for 
mandatory statutory reserves are not allowable unless specifically 
provided for in the contract. When the term

[[Page 140]]

``mandatory statutory reserve'' is specifically identified as an 
allowable contract charge without further definition or explanation, it 
means a requirement imposed by State law upon the Carrier to set aside a 
specific amount or rate of funds into a restricted reserve that is 
accounted for separately from all other reserves and surpluses of the 
Carrier and which may be used only with the specific approval of the 
State official designated by law to make such approvals. The amount 
chargeable to the contract may not exceed an allocable portion of the 
amount actually set aside. If the statutory reserve is no longer 
required for the purpose for which it was created, and these funds 
become available for the general use of the Carrier, a pro rata share 
based upon FEHBP's contribution to the total Carrier's set aside shall 
be returned to the FEHBP in accordance with FAR 31.201-5.
    (B) Premium taxes. When the term premium taxes is used in this 
contract without further definition or explanation, it means a tax, fee, 
or other monetary payment directly or indirectly imposed on FEHB 
premiums by any State, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, or by any political subdivision or other governmental 
authority of those entities, with the sole exception of a tax on net 
income or profit, if that tax, fee, or payment is applicable to a broad 
range of business activity.
    (c) Certification of Accounting Statement Accuracy. (1) The Carrier 
shall certify the annual accounting statement in the form set forth in 
paragraph (c)(3) of this clause. The certificate shall be signed by the 
chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of the Carrier.
    (2) The Carrier shall require an authorized agent of its 
underwriter, if any, also to certify the annual accounting statement.
    (3) The certificate required shall be in the following form:

             Certification of Accounting Statement Accuracy

    This is to certify that I have reviewed this accounting statement 
and to the best of my knowledge and belief:
    1. The statement was prepared in conformity with the guidelines 
issued by the Office of Personnel Management and fairly presents the 
financial results of this contract period in conformity with those 
guidelines;
    2. The costs included in the statement are allowable and allocable 
in accordance with the terms of the contract and with the cost 
principles of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Acquisition 
Regulation and the Federal Acquisition Regulation;
    3. Income, rebates, allowances, refunds and other credits made or 
owed in accordance with the terms of the contract and applicable cost 
principles have been included in the statement;
    4. If applicable, the letter of credit account was managed in 
accordance with 5 CFR part 890, 48 CFR chapter 16, and OPM guidelines.

    (b) Upon learning of a Significant Event OPM may institute action,

clause, the OPM will notify the Carrier and offer an opportunity to

date of this contract or modification.
    ``Country concerned,'' as used in this clause, means any country, 
other than the United States, its possessions, and Puerto Rico, in which 
expenditures under this contract are made.
    ``Tax'' and ``taxes,'' as used in this clause, include fees and 
charges for doing business that are levied by the government of the

increased tax or duty, or tax that was exempted or excluded on the

the result of legislative, judicial, or administrative action taking 
effect after the contract date.
    ``After-relieved tax,'' as used in this clause, means any amount of 
tax or duty, other than an excepted tax, that would otherwise have been 
payable on the transactions covered by this contract, but which the 
Carrier is not required to pay or bear, or for which the Carrier obtains 
a refund, as the result of legislative, judicial, or administrative 
action taking effect after the contract date.
    ``Excepted tax,'' as used in this clause, means social security or 
other employment taxes, net income and franchise taxes, excess profits 
taxes, capital stock taxes, transportation taxes, unemployment

includes all applicable taxes and duties, except taxes and duties that 
the Government of the United States and the government of the country 
concerned have agreed shall not be applicable to expenditures in such

after-imposed tax or of any tax or duty specifically excluded from the 
contract price by a provision of this contract that the Carrier is 
required to pay or bear, including any interest or penalty, if the 
Carrier states in writing that the contract price does not include any 
contingency for such tax and if liability for such tax, interest, or 
penalty was not incurred through the Carrier's fault, negligence, or 
failure to follow instructions of the Contracting Officer or to comply

    (e) The contract price shall be decreased by the amount of any 
after-relieved tax, including any interest or penalty. The Government of 
the United States shall be entitled to interest received by the Carrier 
incident to a refund of taxes to the extent that such interest was 
earned after the Carrier was paid by the Government of the United States 
for such taxes. The Government of the United States shall be entitled to 
repayment of any penalty refunded to the Carrier to the extent that the 
penalty was paid by the Government.

payment of any tax or duty that either was included in the contract 
price or was the basis of an increase in the contract price, the amount 
of the reduction shall be paid or credited to the Government of the 
United States as the Contracting Officer directs.
    (i) The Carrier shall take all reasonable action to obtain exemption 
from or refund of any taxes or duties, including interest or penalty, 
from which the United States Government, the Carrier, any subcontractor, 
or the transactions covered by this contract are exempt under the laws 
of the country concerned or its political subdivisions or which the 
governments of the United States and of the country concerned have 
agreed shall not be applicable to expenditures in such country by or on 
behalf of the United States.
    (j) The Carrier shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of all 
matters relating to taxes or duties that reasonably may be expected to 
result in either an increase or decrease in the contract price and shall 
take appropriate action as the Contracting Officer directs. The contract 
price shall be equitably adjusted to cover the costs of action taken by 
the Carrier at the direction of the Contracting Officer, including any 
interest, penalty, and reasonable attorneys' fees.

the Carrier's accounting records.
    (b) In certain instances the physical separation of FEHBP funds may 
not be practical or desirable. In such cases, the Carrier may request a 
waiver from this requirement from the Contracting Officer. The waiver 
shall be requested in advance and the Carrier shall demonstrate that 
accounting techniques have been established that will clearly measure 
FEHBP cash and investment income (i.e., subsidiary ledgers). 
Reconciliations between amounts reported and actual amounts shown in 
accounting records shall be provided as supporting schedules to the

of, or the time required for, performance of any part of the work under 
this contract, whether or not changed by the order, the Contracting 
Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the contract price, the 
delivery schedule, or both, and shall modify the contract.
    (c) The Carrier must assert its right to an adjustment under this 
clause within 30 days from the date of receipt of the written order. 
However, if the Contracting Officer decides that the facts justify it, 
the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon a proposal submitted 
before final payment of the contract.
    (d) Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a dispute under the 
Disputes clause. However, nothing in this clause shall excuse the 
Carrier from proceeding with the contract as changed.

constitute a determination (1) of the acceptability of any subcontract

contract; or (3) to relieve the Carrier of any responsibility for 
performing this contract.
    (f) No subcontract placed under this contract shall provide for 
payment on a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost basis. Any fee payable under 
cost reimbursement type subcontracts shall not exceed the fee 
limitations in FAR 15.903(d). Any profit or fee payable under a

Service charge.

contract with respect to which the Carrier may be entitled to 
reimbursement from the Government.

    As prescribed in section 1645.303-70, the following clause shall be 
inserted in all FEHBP contracts.

     Government Property (Negotiated Benefits Contracts) (Jan 1998)

    (a) Government-furnished property. (1) The Government shall deliver 
to the Carrier, for use in connection with and under the terms of this 
contract, the Government-furnished property described in this contract 
together with any related data and information that the Carrier may 
request and is reasonably required for the intended use of the property 
(hereinafter referred to as ``Government-furnished property'').
    (2) The delivery or performance dates for this contract are based 
upon the expectation that Government-furnished property suitable for use 
(except for property furnished ``as-is'') will be delivered to the 
Carrier at the times stated in this contract or, if not so stated, in 
sufficient time to enable the Carrier to meet the contract's performance 
dates.
    (3) If Government-furnished property is received by the Carrier in a 
condition not suitable for the intended use, the Carrier shall, upon 
receipt of it, notify the Contracting Officer, detailing the facts, and, 
as directed by the Contracting Officer and at Government expense, either 
repair, modify, return, or otherwise dispose of the property. After 
completing the directed action and upon written request of the Carrier, 
the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment as provided 
in paragraph (h) of this clause.
    (b) Changes in Government-furnished property. (1) The Contracting 
Officer may, by written notice, (i) decrease the Government-furnished 
property provided or to be provided under this contract, or (ii) 
substitute other Government-furnished property for the property to be 
provided by the Government, or to be acquired by the Carrier for the 
Government, under this contract. The Carrier shall promptly take such 
action as the Contracting Officer may direct regarding the removal, 
shipment, or disposal of the property covered by such notice.
    (2) Upon the Carrier's written request, the Contracting Officer 
shall make an equitable adjustment to the contract in accordance with 
paragraph (h) of this clause, if the Government has agreed in this 
contract to make the property available for performing this contract and 
there is any--
    (i) Decrease or substitution in this property pursuant to 
subparagraph (b)(1) above; or
    (ii) Withdrawal of authority to use this property, if provided under 
any other contract or lease.
    (c) Title in Government property. (1) The Government shall retain 
title to all Government-furnished property.
    (2) All Government-furnished property and all property acquired by 
the Carrier, title to which vests in the Government under this paragraph 
(collectively referred to as ``Government property''), are subject to 
the provisions of this clause. Title to Government property shall not be 
affected by its incorporation into or attachment to any property not 
owned by the Government, nor shall Government property become a fixture 
or lose its identity as personal property by being attached to any real 
property.
    (d) Use of Government property. The Government property shall be 
used only for performing this contract, unless otherwise provided in 
this contract or approved by the Contracting Officer.
    (e) Property administration. (1) The Carrier shall be responsible 
and accountable for all Government property provided under this contract 
and shall comply with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 45.5, 
as in effect on the date of this contract.
    (2) The Carrier shall establish and maintain a program for the use, 
maintenance, repair, protection, and preservation of Government property 
in accordance with sound industrial practice and the applicable 
provisions of subpart 45.5 of the FAR.
    (3) If damage occurs to Government property, the risk of which has 
been assumed by the Government under this contract, the Government shall 
replace the items or the Carrier shall make such repairs as the 
Government directs. However, if the Carrier cannot effect such repairs 
within the time required, the Carrier shall dispose of the property as 
directed by the Contracting Officer. When any property for which the 
Government is responsible is replaced or repaired, the Contracting 
Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in accordance with paragraph 
(h) of this clause.
    (4) The Carrier represents that the contract price does not include 
any amount for repairs or replacement for which the Government is 
responsible. Repair or replacement

[[Page 147]]

of property for which the Carrier is responsible shall be accomplished 
by the Carrier at its own expense.
    (f) Access. The Government and all its designees shall have access 
at all reasonable times to the premises in which any Government property 
is located for the purpose of inspecting the Government property.
    (g) Risk of loss. Unless otherwise provided in this contract, the 
Carrier assumes the risk of, and shall be responsible for, any loss or 
destruction of, or damage to, Government property upon its delivery to 
the Carrier. However, the Carrier is not responsible for reasonable wear 
and tear to Government property or for Government property properly 
consumed in performing this contract.
    (h) Equitable adjustment. When this clause specifies an equitable 
adjustment, it shall be made to any affected contract provision in 
accordance with the procedures of the Changes clause. When appropriate, 
the Contracting Officer may initiate an equitable adjustment in favor of 
the Government. The right to an equitable adjustment shall be the 
Carrier's exclusive remedy. The Government shall not be liable to suit 
for breach of contract for--
    (1) Any delay in delivery of Government-furnished property;
    (2) Delivery of Government-furnished property in a condition not 
suitable for its intended use;
    (3) A decrease in or substitution of Government-furnished property; 
or
    (4) Failure to repair or replace Government property for which the 
Government is responsible.
    (i) Final accounting and disposition of Government property. Upon 
completing this contract, or at such earlier dates as may be fixed by 
the Contracting Officer, the Carrier shall submit, in a form acceptable 
to the Contracting Officer, inventory schedules covering all items of 
Government property (including any resulting scrap) not consumed in 
performing this contract or delivered to the Government. The Carrier 
shall prepare for shipment, deliver f.o.b. origin, or dispose of the 
Government property as may be directed or authorized by the Contracting 
Officer. The net proceeds of any such disposal shall be credited to the 
contract price or shall be paid to the Government as the Contracting 
Officer directs.
    (j) Abandonment and restoration of Carrier's premises. Unless 
otherwise provided herein, the Government--
    (1) May abandon any Government property in place, at which time all 
obligations of the Government regarding such abandoned property shall 
cease; and
    (2) Has no obligation to restore or rehabilitate the Carrier's 
premises under any circumstances (e.g., abandonment, disposition upon 
completion of need, or upon contract completion). However, if the 
Government-furnished property is withdrawn or is unsuitable for the 
intended use, or if other Government property is substituted, then the 
equitable adjustment under paragraph (h) of this clause may properly 
include restoration or rehabilitation costs.
    (k) Communications. All communications under this clause shall be in 
writing.
    (l) Overseas contracts. If this contract is to be performed outside 
of the United States of America, its territories, or possessions, the 
words ``Government'' and ``Government-furnished'' (wherever they appear 
in this clause) shall be construed as ``United States Government'' and 
``United States Government-furnished'', respectively.

inserted in all FEHBP contracts.

FEHBP Termination for Convenience of the Government--Negotiated Benefits 
                          Contracts (Jan 1998)

    (a) The Government may terminate performance of work under this 
contract in whole or, from time to time, in part if the Contracting 
Officer determines that a termination is in the Government's interest. 
The Contracting Officer shall terminate by delivering to the Carrier a 
Notice of Termination specifying the extent of terminating and the 
effective date.
    (b) After receipt of a Notice of Termination, and except as directed 
by the Contracting Officer, the Carrier shall immediately proceed with 
the following obligations, regardless of any delay in determining or 
adjusting any amounts due under this clause:
    (1) Stop work as specified in the notice.
    (2) Place no further subcontracts except as necessary to complete 
the continued portion of the contract.
    (3) Terminate all subcontracts to the extent they relate to the work 
terminated.
    (4) Assign to the Government, as directed by the Contracting 
Officer, all right, title, and interest of the Carrier under the

right to settle or to pay any termination settlement proposal arising 
out of those terminations.
    (5) With approval or ratification to the extent required by the 
Contracting Officer, settle all outstanding liabilities and termination 
settlement proposals arising from the termination of subcontracts; the 
approval or ratification will be final for purposes of this clause.
    (6) As directed by the Contracting Officer, deliver to the 
Government any data, reports, or studies that, if the contract had been 
completed, would be required to be furnished to the Government.
    (7) Complete performance of the work not terminated.
    (c) After termination, the Carrier shall submit a final termination 
settlement proposal to the Contracting Officer in the form and with the 
certification prescribed by the Contracting Officer. The Carrier shall 
submit the proposal promptly, but no later than 1 year from the 
effective date of termination, unless extended in writing by the 
Contracting Officer upon written request of the Carrier within this 1-
year period. However, if the Contracting Officer determines that the 
facts justify it, a termination settlement proposal may be received and 
acted on after 1 year or any extension. If the Carrier fails to submit 
the proposal within the time allowed, the Contracting Officer may 
determine, on the basis of information available, the amount, if any, 
due the Carrier because of the termination and shall pay the amount 
determined.
    (d) Subject to paragraph (c) of this clause, the Carrier and the 
Contracting Officer may agree upon the whole or any part of the amount 
to be paid or remaining to be paid because of the termination. The 
amount may include a reasonable allowance for profit on work done. 
However, the agreed amount, whether under this paragraph (d) or 
paragraph (e) of this clause, exclusive of costs shown in subparagraph 
(e)(3) of this clause, may not exceed the total contract price as 
reduced by (1) the amount of payments previously made and (2) the 
contract price of work not terminated. The contract shall be modified, 
and the Carrier paid the agreed amount. Paragraph (e) of this clause 
shall not limit, restrict, or affect the amount that may be agreed upon 
to be paid under this paragraph.
    (e) If the Carrier and the Contracting Officer fail to agree on the 
whole amount to be paid because of the termination of work, the 
Contracting Officer shall pay the Carrier the amounts determined by the 
Contracting Officer as follows, but without duplication of any amounts 
agreed on under paragraph (d) above:
    (1) The contract price for completed services accepted by the 
Government not previously paid for.

[[Page 149]]

    (2) The total of--
    (i) The costs incurred in the performance of the work terminated, 
including initial costs and preparatory expense allocable thereto, but 
excluding any costs attributable to services paid or to be paid under 
paragraph (e)(1) of this clause;
    (ii) The cost of settling and paying termination settlement 
proposals under terminated subcontracts that are properly chargeable to 
the terminated portion of the contract if not included in subdivision 
(e)(2)(i) of this clause; and
    (iii) A sum, as profit on subdivision (e)(2)(i) of this clause, 
determined by the Contracting Officer under 49.202 of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation, in effect on the date of this contract, to be 
fair and reasonable.
    (3) The reasonable costs of settlement of the work terminated, 
including--
    (i) Accounting, legal, clerical, and other expenses reasonably 
necessary for the preparation of termination settlement proposals and 
supporting data;
    (ii) The termination and settlement of subcontracts (excluding the 
amounts of such settlements); and
    (f) The cost principles and procedures of part 31 of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation, in effect on the date of this contract, shall 
govern all costs claimed, agreed to, or determined under this clause.
    (g) The Carrier shall have the right of appeal, under the Disputes 
clause, from any determination made by the Contracting Officer under 
paragraph (c), (e), or (i) of this clause, except that if the Carrier 
failed to submit the termination settlement proposal or request for 
equitable adjustment within the time provided in paragraph (c) or (i), 
respectively, and failed to request a time extension, there is no right 
of appeal.
    (h) In arriving at the amount due the Carrier under this clause, 
there shall be deducted--
    (1) All unliquidated advance or other payments to the Carrier under 
the terminated portion of this contract;
    (2) Any claim which the Government has against the Carrier under 
this contract; and
    (i) If the termination is partial, the Carrier may file a proposal 
with the Contracting Officer for an equitable adjustment of the price(s) 
of the continued portion of the contract. The Contracting Officer shall 
make any equitable adjustment agreed upon. Any proposal by the Carrier 
for an equitable adjustment under this clause shall be requested within 
90 days from the effective date of termination unless extended in 
writing by the Contracting Officer.
    (j)(1) The Government may, under the terms and conditions it 
prescribes, make partial payments and payments against costs incurred by 
the Carrier for the terminated portion of the contract, if the 
Contracting Officer believes the total of these payments will not exceed 
the amount to which the Carrier will be entitled.
    (2) If the total payments exceed the amount finally determined to be 
due, the Carrier shall repay the excess to the Government upon demand, 
together with interest computed at the rate established by the Secretary 
of the Treasury under 50 U.S.C. App. 1215(b)(2). Interest shall be 
computed for the period from the date the excess payment is received by 
the Carrier to the date the excess is repaid.
    (k) Unless otherwise provided in this contract or by statute, the 
Carrier shall maintain all records and documents relating to the 
terminated portion of this contract for 3 years after final settlement. 
This includes all books and other evidence bearing on the Carrier's 
costs and expenses under this contract. The Carrier shall make these 
records and documents available to the Government, at the Carrier's 
office, at all reasonable times, without any direct charge. If approved 
by the Contracting Officer, photographs, microphotographs, or other 
authentic reproductions may be maintained instead of original records 
and documents.

1652.249-72  FEHBP termination for default--negotiated benefits contracts.

    As prescribed in Sec. 1649.101-72, the following clause shall be 
inserted in all FEHBP contracts.

 FEHBP Termination for Default--Negotiated Benefits Contracts (Jan 1998)

    (a) (1) The Government may, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, 
by written notice of default to the Carrier, terminate this contract in 
whole or in part if the Carrier fails to--
    (i) Perform the services within the time specified in this contract 
or any extension;
    (ii) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract 
(but see subparagraph (a)(2) below); or
    (iii) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (but see 
subparagraph (a)(2) below).
    (2) The Government's right to terminate this contract under 
subdivisions (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) above, may be exercised if the Carrier 
does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if authorized in 
writing by the Contracting Officer) after receipt of the notice from the 
Contracting Officer specifying the failure.

[[Page 150]]

    (b) If the Government terminates this contract in whole or in part, 
it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the Contracting 
Officer considers appropriate, supplies or service similar to those 
terminated, and the Carrier will be liable to the Government for any 
excess costs for those supplies or services. However, the Carrier shall 
continue the work not terminated.
    (c) Except for defaults of subcontractors at any tier, the Carrier 
shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the 
contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or 
negligence of the Carrier. Examples of such causes include (1) acts of 
God or of the public enemy, (2) acts of the Government in either its 
sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, (4) floods, (5) epidemics, 
(6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and (9) 
unusually severe weather. In each instance the failure to perform must 
be beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the 
Carrier.
    (d) If the failure to perform is caused by the default of a 
subcontractor at any tier, and if the cause of the default is beyond the 
control of both the Carrier and subcontractor, and without the fault or 
negligence of either, the Carrier shall not be liable for any excess 
costs for failure to perform, unless the subcontracted supplies or 
services were obtainable from other sources in sufficient time for the 
Carrier to meet the required delivery schedule.
    (e) If this contract is terminated for default, the Government may 
require the Carrier to transfer title and deliver to the Government, as 
directed by the Contracting Officer, any completed or partially 
completed information and contract rights that the Carrier has 
specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this 
contract.
    (f) If, after termination, it is determined that the Carrier was not 
in default, or that the default was excusable, the rights and 
obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had 
been issued for the convenience of the Government.
    (g) The rights and remedies of the Government in this clause are in 
addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this 
contract.

                   Subpart 1652.3--FEHBP Clause Matrix


<R05>
1652.370  Use of the matrix.

    (a) The matrix in this section lists the FAR and FEHBAR clauses to 
be used with contracts based on cost analysis and contracts based on a 
combination of cost and price analysis. Carriers shall submit initial 
applications and requests for renewals on the basis that the new 
contract or contract renewal will include the clauses indicated.
    (b) Certain contract clauses are mandatory for FEHBP contracts. 
Other clauses are to be used only when made applicable by pertinent 
sections of the FAR or FEHBAR. An ``M'' in the ``Use Status'' column 
indicates that the clause is mandatory. An ``A'' indicates that the 
clause is to be used only when the applicable conditions are met.
    (c) Clauses are incorporated in the contract either in full text or 
by reference. If the full text is to be used, the matrix indicates a 
``T''. If the clause is incorporated by reference, the matrix indicates 
an ``R''.

<R05>
1801.000  Scope of part.

    This part sets forth general information about the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Federal Acquisition 
Regulations (FAR) Supplement, also referred to as the NFS.


<R04>
              Subpart 1801.1--Purpose, Authority, Issuance


<R05>
1801.103  Authority. (NASA supplements paragraph (a))

    (a) Under the following authorities, the Administrator has delegated 
to the Associate Administrator for Procurement authority to prepare, 
issue, and maintain the NFS:
    (i) The National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 (Public Law 85-
568; 42 U.S.C. 2451 et seq.).
    (ii) 10 U.S.C. chapter 137.
    (iii) Other statutory authority.
    (iv) FAR subpart 1.3.


<R05>
1801.104  Applicability.

    The NFS applies to all acquisitions as defined in FAR Part 2 except 
those expressly excluded by the FAR or this chapter.


<R05>
1801.105  Issuance.


<R05>
1801.105-1  Publication and code arrangement. (NASA supplements paragraphs (a) and (b))

    (a)(i) The NFS is published in the same publications and formats as 
the FAR.
    (ii) The NFS is published in ``editions'' and ``versions.'' An 
``edition'' is a loose-leaf publication of the entire regulation and is 
denoted by the calendar year of publication. A ``version'' is the basic 
loose-leaf edition NFS with all NFS Directive (NFSD) change pages filed 
up to and including the NFSD number that corresponds to the ``version'' 
number. For example, for the 1989 edition of the NFS, Version 89.3 
consists of pages from NFSD 89-0 (basic NFS), with change pages filed 
from NFSDs 89-1, 89-2, and 89-3.

[[Page 162]]

    (b) The NFS is issued as chapter 18 of title 48, Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR).


<R05>
1801.105-2  Arrangement of regulations. (NASA supplements paragraph (b))

    (b)(1)(A) Numbering of NFS text implementing the FAR shall be the 
same as that of the related FAR text, except when the NFS coverage 
exceeds one paragraph. In such case the NFS text is numbered by skipping 
a unit in the FAR 1.105-2(b)(2) prescribed numbering sequence. For 
example, two paragraphs implementing FAR 1.105-2(b)(1) are numbered 
1801.105-2(b)(1) (A) and (B), rather than (1) (i) and (ii). Further 
subdivision of the NFS implementing paragraphs would follow the 
prescribed sequence in FAR 1.105(b)(2).
    (B) NFS text that supplements the FAR is numbered the same as its 
FAR counterpart with the addition of a number 70 and up. For example, 
NFS supplement of FAR subsection 1.105-3 is numbered 1801.105-370. 
Supplemental text exceeding one paragraph is numbered using the FAR 
1.105-2(b)(2) prescribed numbering sequence without skipping a unit.
    (2) Subdivision numbering below the fourth level repeats the 
numbering sequence using italicized letters and numbers.


<R05>
1801.105-3  Copies (NASA paragraphs (1), (2) and (3)).

    (1) Subscriptions to the NFS may be obtained by writing to 
Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO), 
Washington, DC 20402, or by calling (202) 512-1800. All requests should 
cite the NFS GPO Subscription Stock No. 933-003-00000-1. A subscription 
consists of the basic edition, plus all changes issued for an indefinite 
period. The prices and periods of subscriptions are set by GPO.
    (2) The NFS is also available on the Internet (address: http://
www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/nfstoc.htm).
    (3) Copies of NASA Handbooks (NHBs), NASA Management Instructions 
(NMIs), NASA Policy Directives (NPDs), and NASA Procedures and 
Guidelines (NPGs) may be obtained from NASA Headquarters, Office of 
Management Systems and Facilities (Code JM).


<R05>
1801.105-370  Internal dissemination.

    The Headquarters Office of Procurement (Code HK), (202-358-1248), 
distributes the FAR, Federal Acquisition Circulars (FACs), the NFS, 
NFSDs, Procurement Notices (PNs), and Procurement Information Circulars 
(PICs) directly to NASA Headquarters offices and installation 
distribution points. NASA center personnel may be placed on the 
distribution list or may obtain extra copies by contacting the 
designated distribution point for their installation.


<R05>
1801.106  OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act. (NASA paragraphs (1) and (2))

    (1) NFS requirements. The following OMB control numbers apply:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Solicitations and contracts. Various requirements in a 
solicitation or contract, generally in the statement of work, are not 
tied to specific paragraphs cleared in paragraph (1) of this section, 
yet require information collection or recordkeeping. The following OMB 
control numbers apply to these requirements: 2700-0086 (acquisitions up 
to $25,000), 2700-0087 (solicitations that may result in bids or 
proposals not exceeding $500,000), 2700-0085 (solicitations that may 
result in bids or proposals exceeding $500,000), 2700-0088 (contracts 
not exceeding $500,000), and 2700-0089 (contracts exceeding $500,000).


<R04>
                      Subpart 1801.2--Aministration


<R05>
1801.270  Amendment of regulation.


<R05>
1801.270-1  Revisions.

    The NFS is amended by publishing amendments in the Federal Register 
and issuing NFSDs containing loose-

[[Page 163]]

leaf replacement pages revising various segments of it (also see 
1801.270-2). Each replacement page bears the NFSD number and page number 
at the top. A vertical bar at the side of a line indicates that a change 
has been made within that line.


<R05>
1801.270-2  Procurement Notices.

    (a) The NFS is amended by publishing amendments in the Federal 
Register and issuing Procurement Notices (PNs) when it is necessary or 
advisable to change the NFS in advance of an NFSD.
    (b) Unless otherwise indicated, each PN remains in effect until the 
effective date of the subsequent NFSD incorporating the PN or until 
specifically canceled.


<R05>
1801.270-3  Effective date.

    (a) Compliance with a revision to the NFS shall be in accordance 
with the NFSD or PN containing the revision.
    (b) Unless otherwise stated, solicitations that have been issued, 
and bilateral agreements for which negotiations have been completed, 
before the receipt of new or revised contract clauses need not be 
amended to include the new or revised clauses if including them would 
unduly delay the acquisition.


<R05>
1801.270-4  Numbering.

    NFSDs and PNs are numbered consecutively, prefixed by the last two

<R04>
             Subpart 1801.3--Agency Acquisition Regulations


<R05>
1801.301  Policy. (NASA supplements paragraphs (a) and (b))

    (a) (2) Heads of NASA field installations may prescribe policies and 
procedures that do not have a significant effect beyond the internal 
operating procedures of their installations. All other policies, 
procedures, and solicitation and contract provisions and clauses must be 
forwarded to the Headquarters Office of Procurement (Code HK) for 
approval in accordance with 1801.271(b).
    (b) (i) 41 U.S.C. 418b requires publication of NFS changes for 
public comment where there will be a significant effect beyond the 
internal operating procedures of the agency or a significant cost or 
administrative impact on contractors or offerors. However, it does not 
define ``significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures'' 
or ``significant cost or administrative impact.'' Examples of policies 
or procedures that fall in either of these categories are:
    (A) A contract clause requiring contractors to take precautions to 
avoid injury to Florida manatees, which have

[[Page 164]]

been designated as an endangered species, has a significant cost impact 
for contractors who must obtain protective devices for boat propellers 
and take other safety actions.
    (B) A contract clause requiring contractors to follow the 
Government's holiday schedule, thereby disallowing premium pay for work 
on contractor-designated holidays, will have an effect outside the 
internal operating procedures of the agency.
    (C) A contract clause requiring contractors to segregate costs by 
appropriations will affect the contractor's internal accounting system 
and have a significant impact.
    (D) Requiring contractor compliance with NASA's Space Transportation 
System Personnel Reliability Program will have an effect outside the 
internal operating procedures of the agency.
    (ii) In contrast, the following would not have to be publicized for 
public comment:
    (A) Security procedures for identifying and badging contractor 
personnel to obtain access at a NASA installation.
    (B) A one-time requirement in a construction contract for the 
contractor to develop a placement plan and for inspection prior to any 
concrete being placed. (This is a part of the specification or statement 
of work.)
    (C) A policy that requires the NASA installation to maintain copies 
of unsuccessful offers.


<R05>
1801.303  Publication and codification. (NASA supplements paragraph (a))

    (1) Identification of the FAR or the NFS requirement from which a 
deviation is sought;
    (2) A full description of the deviation, the circumstances in which 
it will be used, and the specific contract action(s) to which it 
applies;
    (3) A description of its intended effect;

previously and, if so, the circumstances of the previous request;
    (5) Identification of the contractor(s) and the contract(s) 
affected, including dollar value(s);
    (6) Detailed reasons supporting the request, including any pertinent 
background information; and
    (7) A copy of counsel's concurrence or comments.
    (c) In addition to the information required by 1801.471(b), requests 
for individual deviations from FAR cost principles under FAR 31.101 
should include a copy of the contractor's request for cost allowance.


<R04>
     Subpart 1801.6--Career Development, Contracting Authority, and 
                            Responsibilities


<R05>
1801.601  General.

    The authority to contract for authorized supplies and services is 
delegated to the Associate Administrator for Procurement and 
installation officials by NPD 5101.32.


<R05>
1801.602-3  Ratification of unauthorized commitments. (NASA supplements paragraphs (b) and (c))

    (b) Policy. Individuals making unauthorized commitments may be 
subject to disciplinary action, and the issue may be referred to the 
Office of Inspector General.
    (c)(7) The authority in FAR 1.602-3 may be exercised only when--
    (A) The Government employee who made the unauthorized commitment, or 
his/her supervisor, if appropriate, initiates a procurement request in 
accordance with 1804.7301.

[[Page 165]]

    (B) The procurement request and/or accompanying documentation 
identifies the individual who made the unauthorized commitment, and 
includes a statement signed by the individual that explains why normal 
acquisition procedures were not followed, explains why the firm was 
selected, lists other sources considered, describes the work, and 
estimates or states the agreed price. If the Government representative 
who made the unauthorized commitment is no longer available, appropriate 
program personnel shall provide the information described in this 
paragraph.
    (C) The procurement request is submitted through the director of the 
cognizant program office at the contracting activity, or comparable 
official. In the procurement request, the director shall describe 
measures taken to prevent the recurrence of the unauthorized commitment.


<R05>
1801.603  Selection, appointment, and termination of appointment.


<R05>
1801.603-2  Selection.

    Normally, only GS-1102 and -1105 personnel with the proper training 
and experience may be appointed contracting officers and only when a 
valid organizational need can be demonstrated.


<R05>
1801.670  Delegations to contracting officer's technical representatives (COTRs).

    A COTR delegation may be made only by the contracting officer 
cognizant of that contract at the time the delegation is made. If the 
cognizant contracting officer is absent, the delegation letter may be 
signed by a warranted contracting officer at any level above the 
cognizant contracting officer. An individual COTR may have only the 
duties specifically identified in a written delegation to him or her by 
name (i.e., COTR duties may not be delegated to a position) and has no 
authority to exceed them. COTRs should be informed that they may be 
personally liable for unauthorized commitments. Contracting officer 
authority to sign or authorize contractual instruments shall not be 
delegated through a COTR designation or by any means other than a 
contracting officer warrant.


<R04>
               Subpart 1801.7--Determinations and Findings


<R05>

specified in the FAR or the NFS text for the associated subject matter. 
The Administrator may make any of the D&Fs that may be made by the 
Associate Administrator for Procurement or by a contracting officer.


<R05>
1801.770  Legal review.

    Each D&F, including class D&Fs, shall be reviewed by counsel for 
form and legality before signature by the approving authority.

ceiling price value is the face value.
    (B) For indefinite delivery, time and material, labor hour, and 
similar contracts, the estimated amount of the basic contract is the 
face value. Individual orders up to the face value shall not be 
announced regardless of value. However, after the face value is reached, 
any subsequent modifications or orders of $25 million or greater must be 
announced.
    (ii) NASA Headquarters public announcement is also required for 
award of a contract action with a value of less than $25 million if the 
contracting officer believes it to have Agency public information 
implications.
    (iii) Contractual instruments requiring Headquarters public 
announcement shall not be distributed nor shall any source outside NASA 
be notified of their status until the public announcement procedures in 
1805.303-70 have been completed.

excluded and shall include the following information as applicable and 
any other relevant information:
    (i) The specific purpose to be served in excluding the source as 
enumerated in FAR 6.202(a).
    (ii) The acquisition history of the supplies or services, including 
sources, prices, quantities, and dates of award.
    (iii) The circumstances making it necessary to exclude a particular 
source from the contract action:

[[Page 181]]

    (A) Reasons for lack of sources; e.g., the technical complexity and 
criticality of the item.
    (B) Current annual requirement and prospective needs for the 
supplies and services.
    (C) Projected future requirements.
    (iv) Whether the existing source must be totally excluded from the

terms of any loss of capability to furnish the supplies or services in 
subsequent contract actions.
    (vi) When the authority of FAR 6.202(a)(1) is cited, the basis for--
    (A) Assumptions regarding future competition; and
    (B) The determination that exclusion of a particular source will 
likely result in reduced overall costs for anticipated future 
acquisitions, including (as a minimum) discussion of start-up costs, 
costs associated with facilities, duplicative administration costs (such 
as for additional inspection or testing), economic order quantities, and 
life-cycle-cost considerations.

    (v) Approval of an acquisition plan does not constitute approval of 
any special conditions, or special clauses that may be required unless 
the plan so specifies, and the individual having approval authority is a 
signatory of the plan. All required deviations shall be approved through 
the procedures described in FAR 1.4 and 1801.4.
    (vi) A single acquisition plan may be used for all phases of a 
phased acquisition provided the plan fully addresses each phase, and no 
significant changes occur after plan approval to invalidate the 
description of the phases. If such significant changes do occur, the 
plan shall be amended and approved at the same level as the original 
plan.
    (e) Acquisition plans should be prepared on a program or system 
basis when practical. In such cases, the plan should fully address all 
component acquisitions of the program or system.

<R04>
                    Subpart 1807.71--Master Buy Plan


<R05>
1807.7100  General.

    The Master Buy Plan provides information on planned acquisitions to 
enable management to focus its attention on a representative selection 
of high-dollar-value and otherwise sensitive acquisitions.


<R05>
1807.7101  Applicability.

    (a) The Master Buy Plan applies to each negotiated acquisition, 
including supplemental agreements, where the dollar value, including the 
aggregate amount of options, follow-on acquisitions, or later phases of 
multi-phase acquisitions, is expected to equal or exceed $50,000,000.
    (b) For initial annual Master Buy Plan submission only, each 
installation shall submit its three largest acquisitions regardless of 
dollar value and all acquisitions over $50,000,000.
    (c) The procedure also applies to:
    (1) Any supplemental agreement that contains either new work, a 
debit change order, or a credit change order (or any combination/
consolidation thereof), if the absolute value of the actions equals or 
exceeds $50,000,000 (e.g., the absolute value of a supplemental 
agreement adding $30,000,000 of new work and deleting $30,000,000 of 
work is $60,000,000, and is therefore subject to the Master Buy Plan).
    (2) Any supplement agreement that contains one or more elements (new 
work and/or individual change orders) of a sensitive nature that, in the 
judgment of the installation or Headquarters, warrants Headquarters 
consideration under the Master Buy Plan, even though the value does not 
equal or exceed $50,000,000.
    (d) The Master Buy Plan does not apply to incremental funding 
actions or termination settlement agreements.


<R05>
1807.7102  Submission, selection, and notification procedures.


<R05>
1807.7102-1  Submission of Master Buy Plan.

    (a) Prior to July 15th of every year, each installation shall submit 
to the Headquarters Office of Procurement (Code HS) a Master Buy Plan 
(electronically or original and eight copies) for the next fiscal year, 
listing every known acquisition that
    (1) Meets the criteria in 1807.7101,
    (2) Is expected to be initiated in that fiscal year, and
    (3) Has not been included in a previous Master Buy Plan or amendment 
to a Master Buy Plan.
    (b) The fiscal year Master Buy Plan shall list all uncompleted 
acquisitions selected for Headquarters review and approval from prior 
Master Buy Plans and amendments to Master Buy Plans. These acquisitions 
should be listed by the appropriate fiscal year Master Buy Plan and 
individual item numbers, and should indicate the current status of the 
individual acquisition documents previously selected for Headquarters 
review and approval.
    (c) Plans shall be prepared in accordance with 1807.7103 and shall 
identify the individual acquisition documents involved for every 
acquisition listed. Acquisition documents that may require Headquarters 
approval will be

[[Page 187]]

held in abeyance until receipt of the notification required by 
1807.7102-3. This is not to preclude the planning for or initiation of 
such documents up to that point where Headquarters approval may be 
required.


<R05>
1807.7102-2  Submission of amendments to the Master Buy Plan.

    (a) Acquisitions identified by installations after submission of 
their Master Buy Plan and meeting the criteria in 1807.7102-1(a) shall 
be submitted to Headquarters in accordance with 1807.7103 and identified 
as an amendment to the fiscal year Master Buy Plan submission.
    (b) Master Buy Plan submissions should not be accomplished after the 
fact. Amendments shall be submitted sufficiently in advance of contract 
award date to allow Headquarters to select those acquisition documents 
that will be subject to Headquarters review and approval without 
creating an unacceptable delay in contract placement.
    (c) When timely submittal is not possible, the installation shall 
provide with the amendment a narrative explaining the circumstances 
leading to the late submittal. A Master Buy Plan submission for a 
contract change order expected to meet the criteria in 1807.7101 shall 
be submitted to Headquarters immediately upon issuance of the change 
order.


<R05>
1807.7102-3  Selection and notification procedures.

    (a) The Headquarters Office of Procurement (Code HS) shall select 
acquisition documents from the Master Buy Plan and amendments to Master 
Buy Plans to receive Headquarters review and approval and shall 
designate source selection officials.
    (b) When, subsequent to document selection or delegation, an 
acquisition is changed (for example, increase or decrease in dollar 
amount, change in requirement), canceled, superseded, deferred, or 
becomes no longer subject to the Master Buy Plan procedures in 
accordance with the criteria in 1807.7101, the installation shall 
immediately notify Code HS, giving the reasons. Code HS shall notify the 
installation's procurement office in writing of any further action that 
may be required.
    (c) Acquisition documents not selected for Headquarters review will 
be subject to after-the-fact reviews by Headquarters during normal 
procurement management surveys or other special reviews. Acquisition 
delegations may subsequently be rescinded if a Headquarters review is 
deemed appropriate.


<R05>
1807.7103  Format of Master Buy Plan.

    In accordance with the requirements of 1807.7102-1 and 1807.7102-2, 
Master Buy Plans and amendments to Master Buy Plans shall be prepared in 
accordance with the format illustrated in Table 1807-1.

<R05>
1808.002-72  Acqusition of propellants.

    (a) General. NASA (and its contractors when authorized in accordance 
with 1851.1) may acquire the items listed in paragraph (j) of this 
section (except for liquid hydrogen; see 1808.002-71) on a reimbursable 
basis from the San Antonio Air Logistics Center (SA-ALC), Kelly Air 
Force Base, Texas, under the Air Force Missile Procurement Fund (MPF). 
The Air Force MPF shall be used as a supply source for propellants 
whenever there are economic or other advantages to the Government. Field 
installations and offices obtaining supplies from the MPF shall comply 
with the reporting requirements of paragraph (f) of this section.
    (b) Requests for acquisition. To obtain the materials listed in 
paragraph (j) of this section from the Air Force MPF, NASA contracting 
offices will

[[Page 191]]

execute a NASA-Defense Purchase Request (NASA Form 523) (see 1853.303-
523) and forward it to Headquarters, SA-ALC, Kelly Air Force Base, TX 
78241, Attention: SFS. The following additional information should be 
provided on the form:
    (1) Contract number (when material is required for use by a NASA 
contractor).
    (2) Delivery address.
    (3) Mode of transportation (rail, trailer, barge, etc.). When the 
procurement request covers requirements for materials not previously 
forecasted or covers significant changes to previously reported 
requirements, SA-ALC should be notified immediately of such 
requirements.
    (c) Delivery requests.
    (1) A delivery request is a call on the Air Force, made against a 
NASA-Defense Purchase Request (NASA Form 523), specifying the time and 
place of delivery. On the basis of the estimated requirements, the Air 
Force will notify NASA field installations and contractors of the name 
and address of the Air Force office or producing contractor's plant to 
which requests for delivery of materials shall be made. Delivery 
requests may be placed by any means of communication that time 
justifies; however, all verbal requests for delivery must be confirmed 
in writing within 24 hours. The delivery request, whether oral or 
written, must cite the NASA-Defense Purchase Request number under which 
the material is being ordered and contain the following information:
    (i) Nomenclature and National Stock Number.
    (ii) Quantity.
    (iii) Program, project, and task.
    (iv) Contract number (when material is required for use by a NASA 
contractor).
    (v) Delivery address.
    (vi) Dates of delivery.
    (vii) Mode of transportation.
    (viii) Location of weighting stations and scales (if weighing of the 
products before delivery is required).
    (2) Each delivery request shall be numbered as follows to simplify 
identification and control: the last two digits of the calendar year; a 
dash; and a consecutive number beginning with 1 to run through the year 
(e.g., 89-5, for the fifth request made in 1989). Changes to a request 
are identified by adding an alphabetical designator beginning with (A) 
to the number.
    (d) Receiving procedures.
    (1) Receiving documents. Receipt of materials shall be evidenced on 
the receiving document received with the shipment by the signature of an 
individual authorized by NASA to receive materials from the Air Force. 
Every effort should be made to ensure that the NASA-Defense Purchase 
Request number is recorded on the receiving document before signing.
    (2) Weighing facilities. Local weighing facilities (NASA-owned, 
contractor-owned, commercial, or State-operated) may be used to 
determine quantities of product received. If a discrepancy exists 
between the quantities shown on receiving documents and the quantities 
actually received--
    (i) A certified weighing ticket evidencing actual weight at 
destination shall be obtained; and
    (ii) A copy of the receiving document (AF Form 857 or DD Form 250) 
and the original weighting ticket shall be forwarded to Headquarters, 
SA-ALC, Kelly Air Force Base, TX 78241, Attention: ACFOM, identifying 
the discrepancy.
    (3) Distribution of receipts. Copies of all receiving documents 
except the AF Form 857 shall be transmitted to the Headquarters, SA-ALC, 
Kelly Air Force Base, TX 78241, Attention: SACAOM. Receiving documents 
may be accumulated and submitted on the 10th, 20th, and last day of each 
month.
    (e) Billing. The costs of materials obtained through the MPF are 
reimbursable. After delivery, a Standard Form 1080 (Voucher for 
Transfers Between Appropriations and/or Funds (Disbursement)), supported 
by documentary evidence of delivery, will be submitted by Headquarters, 
SA-ALC to the NASA installation designated in the NASA Form 523.
    (f) Reporting requirements.
    (1) Field installations shall submit periodic estimates of 
requirements for materials listed in paragraph (j) of this section for 
all programs under their

[[Page 192]]

cognizance, including in-house contractor requirements. Reports shall be 
submitted in duplicate on AF Form 858, Forecast of Propellant 
Requirements.
    (2) The reports shall be forwarded no later than June 1 and December 
1 to reach Headquarters, SA-ALC, Kelly AFB, TX 78241, Attn: SFS. 
Supplemental reports advising of additions to or significant changes in 
previous reports may be submitted at any time. The reports, covering all 
materials listed in paragraph (j) of this section, due in June and 
December, shall begin with requirements as of the following July 1 and 
January 1, respectively, and shall cover a 3-year period. Requirements 
shall be shown by month for the first 6 months, and by quarters for the 
remaining 2\1/2\-year period.
    (3) Estimated requirements and other pertinent data required from 
contractors shall be obtained on Air Force Form 858.
    (g) Report content. Reports shall be made using a separate report 
form for each material and shall provide, for each item of material, 
the--
    (1) Contract number;
    (2) Program and/or project;
    (3) Specific task within the project;
    (4) End use when not associated with the named program or project;
    (5) Contractor's name;
    (6) Specific location of use (shipping destination); and
    (7) Planned source of supply.
    (h) Basis for developing materials requirements. In computing 
requirements, consideration shall be given to such elements as lead 
time, waste factors, transfer, and storage losses so that phased 
requirements reflect the total gross quantities required to be delivered 
to the use or storage site. Since the requirements estimates are being 
used by other Government agencies acting as supply sources to contract 
for materials, estimates must be as accurate as possible.
    (i) NASA coordination. The Kennedy Space Center shall coordinate the 
review of all data and establish NASA policy and procedures. The data 
shall be used as the basis for NASA requirements reports to various 
Government agencies for planning and supply support.
    (j) Table of reportable materials.

           Subpart 1809.1--Responsible Prospective Contractors


<R05>
1809.104-4  Subcontractor responsibility.

    Generally, the Canadian Commercial Corporation's (CCC) proposal of a 
firm as its subcontractor is sufficient basis for an affirmative 
determination of responsibility. However, when the CCC determination of 
responsibility is not consistent with other information available to the 
contracting office, the contracting officer shall request from the CCC 
and any other sources whatever information is necessary to make the 
responsibility determination.
    Upon request, CCC shall be furnished the rationale for any 
subsequent determination of nonresponsibility.


<R05>
1809.106  Preaward surveys.


<R05>
1809.106-1  Conditions for preaward surveys. (NASA supplements paragraph (a)).

    (a)(i) Preaward surveys are used only to assist the contracting 
officer to make determinations of responsibility under FAR 9.104. They 
are not to be used to obtain information useful to proposal evaluation 
that does not directly relate to the responsibility determination. 
Accordingly, preaward surveys shall not be used except in rare 
circumstances when determination of responsibility cannot be made 
without the specific information that can be provided only in a preaward 
survey report and only after all other means of obtaining the required 
information have been explored.
    (ii) Surveys shall not be performed for companies of any size 
performing study or research contracts.
    (iii) The procurement officer shall approve all preaward survey 
requests.


<R05>
1809.106-2  Requests for preaward surveys. (NASA supplements paragraph (a))

    (a) The ``Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act'' block of Section I is 
for information purposes only. If information is needed for a 
determination on the offeror's eligibility under the Walsh-Healey Act, 
it must be specifically requested in block 20.H. of Section III.


<R05>
1809.106-3  Interagency preaward surveys. (NASA supplements paragraph (a))

    If the survey will be performed for NASA by a DOD agency, the SF 
1403 request is to be sent to the appropriate office shown in the DOD 
Directory of Contract Administration Services Components, DLAH 4105.4, 
Attn: Preaward Survey Monitor. DOD normally allows seven working days in 
which to conduct a full survey and submit the report to the requesting 
agency.
[61 FR 47075, Sept. 6, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 36705, July 9, 1997]


<R05>
1809.106-70  Preaward surveys performed by NASA installations.

    In discussions with representatives of the company being surveyed, 
NASA preaward survey team members shall not refer to or comment on the 
possibility of award to the prospective contractor. This does not 
preclude discussion with a prospective contractor of questionable areas 
that require clarification. Information obtained during the survey will 
be treated in strict confidence and divulged only to those Government 
representatives having a need to know.


<R04>
               Subpart 1809.2--Qualifications Requirements

<R05>
1809.203-71  Waiver of qualification requirements.

    When acquiring a product under a specification that includes 
qualification requirements either for the end item or for components of 
the end item, the NASA installation conducting the acquisition can waive 
the qualification requirements. Directing a waiver of the end item 
qualification requirement constitutes adequate authorization for waiver 
of product qualification requirements. When a waiver has been granted, 
the solicitation shall specifically indicate that the qualification 
requirement is inapplicable. Such information shall also be included in 
any synopsis of the acquisition (see FAR subpart 5.2).


<R05>
1809.206  Acquisitions subject to qualification requirements.


<R05>
1809.206-1  General. (NASA supplements paragraph (b) and (c))

    (b)(i) The authority to determine that an emergency exists is 
delegated to the installation's competition advocate. Requests for 
determination shall be prepared by the cognizant requirements office and 
submitted through the procurement officer.
    (ii) Requests not to enforce a qualification requirement in a 
nonemergency situation shall be prepared by the cognizant requirements 
office and approved by the Headquarters Office of Safety and Mission 
Assurance (Code Q).
    (c) If an offeror seeks to demonstrate its capability, both the 
product and the producer must meet the established standards.


<R05>
1809.206-70  Small businesses.

    If a small business otherwise eligible for award has been placed in 
a special status on a Qualified Products List (Mil-Bul-103) or the 
Qualified Manufacturers List (QML-38510) established as a part of the 
NASA Microelectronics Reliability Program and the contracting officer 
determines that the small business does not appear to have the capacity 
to perform, the certificate of competency procedures in FAR subpart 19.6 
are applicable.


<R05>
1809.206-71  Contract clause.

    When qualified products (end items or components of end items) are 
being procured, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 
1852.209-70, Product Removal from Qualified Products List, in the 
solicitation and in the resulting contract.

    If it is believed that a new contract or subcontract must be awarded 
to a firm on the List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and 
Nonprocurement Programs, the procurement officer shall prepare a request 
for a determination with all necessary supporting information and 
forward it to the Associate Administrator for Procurement (Code HS) for 
approval.


<R05>
1809.405-1  Continuation of current contracts. (NASA supplements paragraph (c))

    (c) Approval of contract renewals or extensions shall be requested 
in accordance with 1809.405.

Measurements in NASA Programs.


<R04>
     Subpart 1811.1--Selecting and Developing Requirements Documents


<R05>
1811.104  Items peculiar to one manufacturer.


<R05>
1811.104-70  Brand name or equal purchase descriptions.

    (a) Use of brand-name purchase descriptions is the least preferred 
method for describing Agency requirements. Purchase descriptions 
containing references to one or more brand-name products, or components 
of a product, followed by ``or equal'' may be used only in accordance 
with this part 1811.
    (b) The term ``or equal'' should not be added if it is determined 
under FAR 11.104 that only a particular product meets the essential 
requirements of the Government.
    (c) To the extent feasible, all acceptable brand-name products 
should be referenced. If ``brand-name-or-equal'' is used, offerors must 
be given the opportunity to offer products other than those referenced 
by brand-name if those products will meet the needs of the Government in 
essentially the same manner.
    (d) ``Brand-name-or-equal'' purchase descriptions should set forth 
the salient physical, functional, or other characteristics essential to 
the needs of the Government. Purchase descriptions should include the 
following items and any other information necessary to describe the 
item:
    (1) Complete common generic identification of the item.
    (2) Model, make, or catalog number for each brand name product, and 
identity of the commercial catalog in which it appears.
    (3) Name of manufacturer, producer, or distributor of each brand 
name product referenced (and address if company is not well known).
    (e) When it is needed to describe the item required, a commercial 
catalog description, or pertinent extracts, may be used if the 
description is identified in the solicitation as being that of the 
manufacturer, producer, or distributor. The contracting officer shall 
ensure that a copy of any catalog referenced (except parts catalogs) is 
available on request for review by offerors at the contracting office.
    (f) Offerors offering brand-name products shall not be required to 
furnish samples; however, solicitations may require the submission of 
samples from offerors proposing ``or equal'' products.
    (g) Proposals offering products differing from brand-name products 
referenced in a ``brand-name-or-equal'' purchase description shall be 
considered for award if the contracting officer determines that the 
offered products meet the salient characteristics required by the 
solicitation. Offers shall not be rejected because of minor differences 
in design, construction, or features that do not affect the suitability 
of the products for their intended use.
    (h) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, when a 
``brand-name-or-equal'' purchase description is included in a 
solicitation, the following shall be inserted after each item so 
described in the solicitation for completion by the offeror:

Offering:

 Manufacturer's Name____________________________________________________

 Brand__________________________________________________________________

 No.____________________________________________________________________

    (i) If the contracting officer determines that the provision at 
1852.211-70 should apply only to certain components, the requirements of 
paragraph (h) of this section shall apply to them, and a statement 
substantially as follows shall be included:

    The provision entitled Brand Name or Equal applies to the following 
components:

(List the components to which the provision applies.)


[[Page 200]]


    (j) Award documents for brand-name-or-equal acquisitions shall 
identify the specific products or components the contractor is to 
furnish. This identification shall include any brand name and make or 
model number, descriptive material, and any modifications of brand name 
products specified in the solicitation.


<R05>
1811.104-71  NASA solicitation provision.

    When a ``brand-name-or-equal'' purchase description is used, the 
contracting officer shall insert in the solicitation the provision at 
1852.211-70, Brand Name or Equal.


<R04>
            Subpart 1811.4--Delivery or Performance Schedules

    (d) Determinations shall be made by the procurement officer.


<R05>
1814.408  Award.


<R05>
1814.408-1  General.

    (1) A notice of award as a specific document is used when the 
contracting officer needs to inform a responsible bidder that its offer 
was determined to be the most advantageous to the Government 
(considering only price and price-related factors) and that the formal 
award will be made upon satisfaction of specified pre-performance 
conditions.

[[Page 206]]

    (2) The notice of award is not a contractual instrument. It does not 
authorize the successful bidder to perform and, in itself, does not 
obligate the Government to award a contractual document. Its limited 
purpose is to provide: evidence of the Government's selection of the 
successful bidder; instruction to that bidder to satisfy specified pre-
performance conditions; and a statement that the Government intends to 
award the contract to the successful bidder upon satisfaction of these 
conditions if a contract is awarded as a result of the invitation for 
bids.
    (3) Use of a notice of award is optional. The contracting officer 
may issue the award document itself without first issuing a notice of 
award. However, there are instances when a notice of award should be 
considered, for example, in construction contracts where performance or 
payment bonds are required. In such cases, the most cost effective 
technique is to require only the successful bidder to provide the 
necessary bonds. The notice of award advises the successful bidder to 
provide the bonds, and it also serves as formal evidence from the 
Government of the impending award if such evidence is required to secure 
the bonds.
    (4) The notice of award shall not be issued unless bids have been 
evaluated and a selection made, and a definitive contract document is 
ready for execution upon satisfaction of the conditions specified in the 
notice. Upon satisfaction of these conditions, the approved and executed 
contract instrument shall be provided to the successful bidder.
    (5) Since the notice of award is not a contractual document 
authorizing performance, the period of performance of the resultant 
contract shall not be based on the date of issuance or receipt of the 
notice of award. The period of performance specified in the contract 
shall be based on some other reference point, such as the date the 
contract is provided to the successful bidder, a mutually agreeable 
effective date of a later authorization to proceed date.
    (6) The notice of award can be issued by any formal written means 
such as a letter, telegram or electronic means. The notice should be 
substantially the same as the following format.

                                 Format

    Subject: Notice of Award--Invitation for Bids (IFB) (a). This notice 
is to advise you that your bid (b) in response to the subject IFB has 
been determined to be the most advantageous to the Government 
(considering only price and price-related factors). It is the 
Government's intention to award you a contract in the amount of (c) for 
this effort pending satisfaction of the following pre-performance 
conditions: (d)
    Evidence (e) of satisfaction of these conditions must be provided to 
the contracting officer by (f). In the event these conditions are not 
satisfied by this date, the Government reserves the right to award the 
contract to the bidder who submitted the next most advantageous bid.
    Please note that this notice of award is not a contractual document. 
It does not obligate the Government to award you, or any other bidder, a 
contract relative to the subject IFB, and it does not authorize you to 
proceed with contract performance or incur costs pursuant to such 
performance. Any costs incurred for contract performance prior to your 
receipt of a fully executed contract document are at your own risk and 
are not recoverable under any Government contract should the Government 
fail, for whatever reason, to award you a contract in response to the 
subject IFB.
    If a contract is awarded after evidence of satisfaction of the pre-
performance conditions listed above is provided to the contracting 
officer by the specified due date, the date of commencement of work will 
be provided with the formal award. This date will be based on (g).

    Notes.--The contracting officer shall insert, where shown, the 
following information:
    (a) Identification of the IFB by number and title.
    (b) Identification of the contractor's bid.
    (c) The award price.
    (d) The preperformance conditions (e.g., any required payment and 
performance bonds).
    (e) The evidence required to satisfy the pre-performance conditions 
(e.g., the actual payment and performance bonds).
    (f) The date by which the evidence must be provided to the 
contracting officer.
    (g) Identification of the date for commencement of performance. The 
period of performance of the contract shall not be based on the date of 
issuance or receipt of the notice of award. It shall be based on the 
date the contract is provided to the successful bidder, a mutually 
agreeable effective date, or a later authorization to proceed date.

<R04>
  Subpart 1815.4--Solicitation and Receipt of Proposals and Quotations


<R05>
1815.405  Solicitations for information or planning purposes.


<R05>
1815.405-70  Draft requests for proposals.

    (a) Except for acquisitions described in 1815.602(b), contracting 
officers shall issue draft requests for proposals (DRFPs) for all 
competitive negotiated acquisitions expected to exceed $1,000,000 
(including all options or later phases of the same project). DRFPs shall 
invite comments from potential offerors on all aspects of the draft 
solicitation, including the requirements, schedules, proposal 
instructions, and evaluation approaches. Potential offerors should be 
specifically requested to identify unnecessary or inefficient 
requirements. When considered appropriate, the statement of work or the 
specifications may be issued in advance of other solicitation sections.
    (b) Contracting officers shall plan the acquisition schedule to 
include adequate time for issuance of the DRFP, potential offeror review 
and comment, and NASA evaluation and disposition of the comments.
    (c) When issuing DRFPs, potential offerors should be advised that 
the DRFP is not a solicitation and NASA is not requesting proposals.
    (d) Whenever feasible, contracting officers should include a summary 
of the disposition of significant DRFP comments with the final RFP.
    (e) The procurement officer may waive the requirement for a DFRP 
upon written determination that the expected benefits will not be 
realized given the nature of the supply or service being acquired. The 
DRFP shall not be waived because of poor or inadequate planning.


<R05>
1815.406  Preparing requests for proposals (RFPs) and requests for quotations (RFQs).


<R05>
1815.406-2  Part I--The Schedule. (NASA supplements paragraph (c))

    (c) To the maximum extent practicable, requirements should be 
defined as performance based specifications/statements of work that 
focus on required outcomes or results, not methods of performance or 
processes.


<R05>
1815.406-5  Part IV--Representations and instructions. (NASA supplements paragraph (b))

    (b) The information required in proposals should be kept to the 
minimum necessary for the source selection decision. Although offerors 
should be provided the maximum flexibility in developing their 
proposals, contracting officers shall specify any information and 
standard formats required for the efficient and impartial evaluation of 
proposals.


<R05>
1815.406-70  Page limitations.

    (a) Technical and contracting personnel will mutually agree on page 
limitations for their respective portions of an RFP. Unless approved in 
writing by the procurement officer, the page limitation for the 
contracting portion of an RFP (all sections except Section C, 
Description/specifications/work statement) shall not exceed 150 pages, 
and the page limitation for the technical portion (Section C) shall not 
exceed 200 pages. Attachments to the RFP count as part of the section to 
which they relate. In determining page counts, a page is defined as one 
side of a sheet, 8\1/2\'' x 11'', with at least one inch margins on all 
sides, using not smaller than 12 characters per inch or equivalent type. 
Foldouts count as an equivalent number of 8\1/2\'' x 11'' pages. The 
metric standard format most closely approximating the described standard 
8\1/2\'' x 11'' size may also be used.
    (b) Page limitations shall also be established for proposals 
submitted in competitive acquisitions. Accordingly, technical and 
contracting personnel will mutually agree on page limitations for each 
portion of the proposal. Unless a different limitation is approved in 
writing by the procurement officer, the total initial proposal, 
excluding title pages, tables of contents, and cost/price information, 
shall not exceed 500 pages using the page definition of 1815.406-70(a). 
Firm page limitations shall also be established for Best and Final 
Offers (BAFOs), if requested. The appropriate BAFO page limitations 
should be determined by considering the complexity of the acquisition

[[Page 209]]

and the extent of any written or oral discussions. The same BAFO page 
limitations shall apply to all offerors. Pages submitted in excess of 
the specified limitations for the initial proposal and BAFO will not be 
evaluated by the Government and will be returned to the offeror.


<R05>
1815.406-71  Installation reviews.

    (a) Installations shall establish procedures to review all RFPs 
before release. When appropriate given the complexity of the acquisition 
or the number of offices involved in solicitation review, centers should 
consider use of a single review meeting, called a Solicitation Review 
Board (SRB), as a streamlined alternative to the serial or sequential 
coordination of the solicitation with reviewing offices. The SRB is a 
meeting in which all offices having review and approval responsibilities 
discuss the solicitation and their concerns. Actions assigned and 
changes required by the SRB shall be documented.
    (b) When source evaluation board (SEB) procedures are used in 
accordance with 1815.612-70, the SEB shall review and approve the RFP 
prior to issuance.


<R05>
1815.406-72  Headquarters reviews.

    For RFPs requiring Headquarters review and approval, the procurement 
officer shall submit ten copies of the RFP to the Associate 
Administrator for Procurement (Code HS). Any significant information 
relating to the RFP or the planned evaluation methodology that are not 
included in the RFP itself should also be provided.


<R05>
1815.407  Solicitation provisions. (NASA supplements paragraphs (c) and (d))

    (c)(6) The provision at FAR 52.215-10, Late Submissions, 
Modifications, and Withdrawals of Proposals shall not be used in 
solicitations for the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small 
Business Technology Transfer Programs, or for broad agency announcements 
listed in 1835.016. See instead 1815.407-70(a).
    (d)(4) The contracting officer shall insert FAR 52.215-16 Alternate 
II in all competitive negotiated solicitations.


<R05>
1815.407-70  NASA solicitation provisions.

    (a) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 1852.215-
73, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Proposals (AO, 
SBIR, and STTR Programs), in lieu of the provision at FAR 52.215-10 in 
Announcements of Opportunity and in Small Business Innovation Research 
(SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer solicitations. (See 
1815.412.)
    (b) The contracting officer shall insert a provision substantially 
as stated at 1852.215-74, Alternate Proposals, in competitive requests 
for proposals if receipt of alternate proposals would benefit the 
Government.
    (c) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 1852.215-
75, Expenses Related to Offeror Submissions, in all requests for 
proposals.
    (d) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 1852.215-
77, Pre-proposal/Pre-bid Conference, in competitive requests for 
proposals and invitations for bids where the Government intends to 
conduct a pre-proposal or pre-bid conference. Insert the appropriate 
specific information relating to the conference.
    (e) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.214-71, 
Grouping for Aggregate Award, in solicitations when it is in the 
Government's best interest not to make award for less than specified 
quantities solicited for certain items or groupings of items. Insert the 
item numbers and/or descriptions applicable for the particular 
acquisition.
    (f) The Contracting Officer shall insert the clause at 1852.214-72, 
Full Quantities, in solicitations when award will be made only on the 
full quantities solicited.
    (g) The Contracting Officer shall insert the provision at 1852.214-
81, Proposal Page Limitations, in all competitive requests for 
proposals.
    (h) The Contracting Officer shall insert the provision at 1852.215-
82, Offeror Oral Presentations, in competitive requests for proposals 
when the Government intends to allow offerors to make oral presentations 
prior to commencement of the Government's formal evaluation.

[[Page 210]]


<R05>
1815.408  Issuing solicitations.


<R05>
1815.408.70  Blackout notices.

    (a) Upon release of the formal RFP, the Contracting Officer shall 
direct all personnel associated with the acquisition to refrain from 
communicating with prospective offerors and to refer all inquiries to 
the Contracting Officer or other authorized representative. This 
procedure is commonly known as a ``blackout notice'' and shall not be 
imposed prior to release of the RFP. The notice may be issued in any 
format (e.g., letter or electronic) appropriate to the complexity of the 
acquisition.
    (b) Blackout notices are not intended to terminate all communication 
with offerors. Contracting officers should continue to provide 
information as long as it does not create an unfair competitive 
advantage or reveal offeror proprietary data.


<R05>
1815.412  Late proposals, modifications, and withdrawals of proposals.


<R05>
1815.412-70  Broad agency announcements (BAAs), Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR), and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) solicitations.

    For BAAs listed in 1835.016, SBIR Phase I and Phase II 
solicitations, and STTR solicitations--
    (a) Proposals, or modifications to them, received from qualified 
firms after the latest date specified for receipt may be considered if a 
significant reduction in cost to the Government is probable or if there 
are significant technical advantages, as compared with proposals 
previously received. In such cases, the project office shall investigate 
the circumstances surrounding the submission of the late proposal or 
modification, evaluate its content, and submit written recommendations 
and findings to the selection official or a designee as to whether there 
is an advantage to the Government in considering the proposal.
    (b) The selection official or a designee shall determine whether to 
consider the proposal.
    (c) Offerors may withdraw proposals any time before award, provided 
the conditions in paragraph (b) of the provision at 1852.215-73, Late 
Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Proposals (AO, SBIR, and 
STTR Programs), are satisfied.


<R05>
1815.413  Disclosure and use of information before award.


<R05>
1815.413-2  Alternate II. (NASA supplements paragraphs (a), (e), and (f))

    The alternate procedures at FAR 15.413-2 shall be used for NASA 
acquisitions in lieu of those prescribed at FAR 15.413-1. These 
procedures, as implemented by this section, apply both before and after 
award.
    (a) During evaluation proceedings, NASA personnel participating in 
any way in the evaluation may not reveal any information concerning the 
evaluation to anyone not also participating, and then only to the extent 
that the information is required in connection with the evaluation. When 
non-NASA personnel participate, they shall be instructed to observe 
these restrictions.
    (e) The notice at FAR 15.413-2(e) shall be placed on the cover sheet 
of all proposals, whether solicited or unsolicited. (See 1805.402 
regarding release of the names of firms submitting offers.)
    (f)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(ii) of this section, the 
procurement officer is the approval authority to disclose proposal 
information outside the Government. This authorization may be granted 
only after compliance with FAR 37.2 and 1837.204, except that the 
determination of nonavailability of Government personnel required by FAR 
37.2 is not required for disclosure of proposal information to JPL 
employees.
    (ii) Proposal information in the following classes of proposals may 
be disclosed with the prior written approval of a NASA official one 
level above the NASA program official responsible for overall conduct of 
the evaluation. The determination of nonavailability of Government 
personnel required by FAR 37.2 is not required for disclosure in these 
instances.
    (A) NASA Announcements of Opportunity proposals;
    (B) Unsolicited proposals;
    (C) NASA Research Announcement proposals;
    (D) SBIR and STTR proposals.

[[Page 211]]

    (iii) The written approvals required by paragraphs (f) (i) and (ii) 
of this section shall be provided to the contracting officer before the 
release of the proposal information. As a minimum, the approval shall:
    (A) Identify the precise proposal information being released;
    (B) Identify the person receiving the proposal information and 
evidence of their appointment as a special government employee or a 
statement of the applicable exception (see 1815.413-270);
    (C) Provide a justification of the need for disclosure of the 
proposal information to the non-Government evaluator(s); and
    (D) Provide a statement that a signed ``Agreement and Conditions for 
Evaluation of Proposals,'' in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this 
section, will be obtained prior to release of the proposal to the 
evaluator.
    (iv) If JPL personnel, in evaluating proposal information released 
to them by NASA, require assistance from non-JPL, non-Government 
evaluators, JPL must obtain written approval to release the information 
in accordance with paragraphs (f)(i) and (f)(ii) of this section.
    (f)(2) The NASA official approving the disclosure of any proposal 
information to a non-Government evaluator, including employees of JPL, 
shall, prior to such disclosure, require each non-Government evaluator 
to sign the following ``Agreement and Conditions for Evaluation of 
Proposals.''

   Agreement and Conditions for Evaluation of Proposals (October 1996)

    (1) The recipient agrees to use proposal information for NASA 
evaluation purposes only. This limitation does not apply to information 
that is otherwise available without restrictions to the Government, 
another competing contractor, or the public.
    (2) The recipient agrees that the NASA proposal cover sheet notice 
(FAR 15.413-2(e) and NFS 1815.413-2(e)), and any notice that may have 
been placed on the proposal by its originator, shall be applied to any 
reproduction or abstract of any proposal information furnished.
    (3) Upon completion of the evaluation, the recipient agrees to 
return all copies of proposal information or abstracts, if any, to the 
NASA office that initially furnished the proposal information for 
evaluation.
    (4) Unless authorized in writing by the NASA official releasing the 
proposal information, the recipient agrees not to contact either the 
business entities originating the proposals or any of their employees, 
representatives, or agents concerning any aspect of the proposal 
information or extracts covered by this agreement.
    (5) The recipient agrees to review his or her financial interests 
relative to the entities whose proposal information NASA furnishes for 
evaluation. At any time the recipient becomes aware that he or she or a 
person with a close personal relationship (household family members, 
business partners, or associates) has or acquires a financial interest 
in the entities whose proposal information is subject to this agreement, 
the recipient shall immediately advise the NASA official releasing the 
proposal information, protect the proposal information, and cease 
evaluation activities pending a NASA decision resolving the conflict of 
interest.

referred. The numbers shall be broken out by source (larger business, 
small business, university, or nonprofit institution).


<R05>
1815.506-70  Relationship of unsolicited proposals to NRAs.

    An unsolicited proposal for a new effort or a renewal, identified by 
an evaluating office as being within the scope of an open NRA, shall be 
evaluated as a response to that NRA (see 1835.016-70), provided that the 
evaluating office can either:
    (a) State that the proposal is not at a competitive disadvantage, or
    (b) Give the offeror an opportunity to amend the unsolicited 
proposal to ensure compliance with the applicable NRA proposal 
preparation instructions. If these conditions cannot be met, the 
proposal must be evaluated separately.

                    Subpart 1815.6--Source Selection


<R05>
1815.601  Definitions. (NASA supplements paragraphs (1) and (2))

    (1) The source selection authority (SSA) is the Agency official 
responsible for proper and efficient conduct of the source selection 
process and for making the final source selection decision. The SSA has 
the following responsibilities:
    (i) Approve the evaluation factors, subfactors, and elements, the 
weight of the evaluation factors and subfactors, and any special 
standards of responsibility (see FAR 9.104-2) prior to release of the 
RFP, or delegate this authority to appropriate management personnel;
    (ii) Appoint the source selection team. However, when the 
Administrator will serve as the SSA, the Official-in-Charge of the 
cognizant Headquarters Program Office will appoint the team; and
    (iii) Provide the source selection team with appropriate guidance 
and special instructions to conduct the evaluation and selection 
procedures.
    (2) The SSA shall be established at the lowest reasonable level for 
each acquisition. For acquisitions designated as Headquarters 
selections, the SSA will be identified as part of the Master Buy Plan 
process (see 1807.71).


<R05>
1815.602  Applicability. (NASA supplements paragraphs (a) and (b))

    (a)(i) Except as indicated in paragraph (b) of this section, NASA 
competitive negotiated acquisitions shall be conducted as follows:
    (A) Acquisitions of $50 million or more--in accordance with FAR 15.6 
and this subpart.
    (B) Other acquisitions--in accordance with FAR 15.6 and this subpart 
except section 1815.612-70.
    (ii) Estimated dollar values of acquisitions shall include the 
values of multiple awards, options, and later phases of the same 
project.
    (b) FAR 15.6 and this subpart are not applicable to acquisitions 
conducted under the following procedures:
    (i) MidRange (see part 1871).

[[Page 214]]

    (ii) Announcements of Opportunity (see part 1872).
    (iii) NASA Research Announcements (see 1835.016-70).
    (iv) The Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program and the 
Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) pilot program under the 
authority of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 638).
    (v) Architect and Engineering (A&E) services (see FAR 36.6 and 
1836.6).


<R05>
1815.605-70  Evaluation factors and subfactors.

    (a) Typically, NASA establishes three evaluation factors: Mission 
Suitability, Cost/Price, and Relevant Experience and Past Performance. 
Evaluation factors may be further defined by subfactors. Although 
discouraged, subfactors may be further defined by elements. Evaluation 
subfactors and any elements should be structured to identify significant 
discriminators, or ``key swingers''--the essential information required 
to support a source selection decision. Too many subfactors and elements 
undermine effective proposal evaluation. All evaluation subfactors and 
any elements should be clearly defined to avoid overlap and redundancy.
    (b) Mission Suitability factor. (1) This factor indicates the merit 
or excellence of the work to be performed or product to be delivered. It 
includes, as appropriate, both technical and management subfactors. 
Mission Suitability shall be numerically weighted and scored on a 1000-
point scale.
    (2) The Mission Suitability factor may identify evaluation 
subfactors to further define the content of the factor. Each Mission 
Suitability subfactor shall be weighted and scored. The adjectival 
rating percentages in 1815.608(a)(3)(A) shall be applied to the 
subfactor weight to determine the point score. The number of Mission 
Suitability subfactors is limited to four. The Mission Suitability 
evaluation subfactors and their weights shall be identified in the RFP.
    (3) Although discouraged, elements that further define the content 
of each subfactor may be identified. Elements, if used, shall not be 
numerically weighted and scored. The total number of elements is limited 
to eight. Any Mission Suitability elements shall be identified in the 
RFP.
    (4) For cost reimbursement acquisitions, the Mission Suitability 
evaluation shall also include the results of any cost realism analysis. 
The RFP shall notify offerors that the realism of proposed costs may 
significantly affect their Million Suitability scores.
    (c) Cost/Price factor. This factor evaluates the reasonableness and, 
if necessary, the cost realism, of proposed costs, prices. The Cost/
Price factor is not numerically weighted or scored.
    (d) Relevant Experience and Past Performance factor. (1) This factor 
indicates the relevant quantitative and qualitative aspects of each 
offeror's record of performing services or delivering products similar 
in size, content, and complexity to the requirements of the instant 
acquisition. The Relevant Experience and Past Performance factor is not 
numerically weighted or scored.
    (2) The RFP shall instruct offerors to submit data (including data 
from relevant Federal, State, and local governments and private 
contracts) that can be used to evaluate their relevant experience and 
past performance. Typically, the RFP will require:
    (i) A list of contracts similar in size, content and complexity to 
the instant acquisition, showing each contract number, the type of 
contract, a brief description of the work, and a point of contact from 
the organization placing the contract. Normally, the requested contracts 
are limited to those received in the last three years. However, in 
acquisitions that require longer periods to demonstrate performance 
quality, such as hardware development, the time period should be 
tailored accordingly.
    (ii) The identification and explanation of any cost overruns or 
underruns, completion delays, performance problems and terminations.
    (3) The Contracting Officer may start collecting past performance 
data prior to proposal receipt. One method for initiating the past 
performance evaluation early is to request offerors to submit their past 
performance information in advance of the proposal due date. The RFP 
could also include a past performance questionnaire for

[[Page 215]]

offerors to send their previous customers with instructions to return 
the completed questionnaire to the Government. Failure of the offeror to 
submit its past performance information early or of the customers to 
submit the completed questionnaires shall not be a cause for rejection 
of the proposal nor shall it be reflected in the Government's evaluation 
of the offeror's past performance.

1815.605-71  Source selection evaluation plan.

    (a) A source selection evaluation plan shall be prepared for each 
source selection. The plan shall include, as a minimum the general and 
specific evaluation guidelines (and special standards of responsibility, 
where applicable) established to assess each offeror's proposal against 
the RFP evaluation factors, subfactors, and elements. The evaluation 
guidelines are designed to focus the evaluators' assessment. They are 
not weighted and are not listed in the RFP. However, the substance of 
the guidelines may be included in a narrative description of the 
subfactors and elements. In addition, the plan includes the system used 
in conducting the evaluation (and scoring, if applicable) of each 
offeror's proposal.
    (b) The source selection evaluation plan shall be approved by the 
source selection authority or other personnel designated in accordance 
with installation procedures before the formal RFP is issued.
    (c) For formal source selections, see 1815.612(c).

<R05>
1815.608  Proposal evaluation. (NASA supplements paragraphs (a) and (b))

    (a) Each proposal shall be evaluated to identify and document:
    (i) Any failures to meet any terms and conditions of the RFP;
    (ii) All strengths and weaknesses, classified as major or minor to 
further underscore discriminators among proposals;
    (iii) The numerical score and/or adjectival rating of each Mission 
Suitability subfactor and for the Mission Suitability factor in total;
    (iv) Cost realism, if appropriate;
    (v) The adjectival rating of the Relevant Experience and Past 
Performance evaluation factor; and
    (vi) Any technical, schedule, and cost risk. Risks may result from 
the offeror's technical approach, manufacturing plan, selection of 
materials, processes, equipment, etc., or as a result of the cost, 
schedule and performance impacts associated with these approaches. Risk 
evaluations must consider the probability of success, the impact of 
failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. Risk 
assessments shall be considered in determining Mission Suitability 
strengths; weaknesses and numerical/adjectival ratings. Identified risk 
areas and the potential for cost impact shall be considered in the cost 
or price evaluation.
    (1) Cost or price evaluation.
    (A) In accordance with 1815.804-1, cost or pricing data shall not be 
requested in competitive acquisitions. Only the minimal information 
other than cost or pricing data necessary to ensure price reasonableness 
and assess cost realism should be requested.
    (B) When contracting on a firm fixed price basis, the contracting 
officer shall not request any cost information, unless proposed prices 
appear unreasonable or unrealistically low given the offeror's proposed 
approach and there are concerns that the contractor may default.
    (C) When contracting on a basis other than firm fixed price, the 
contracting officer shall perform price and cost realism analyses to 
assess the reasonableness and realism of the proposed costs. A cost 
realism analysis will determine if the costs in an offeror's proposal 
are realistic for the work to be performed, reflect a clear 
understanding of the requirements, and are consistent with the various 
elements of the offeror's technical proposal. The analysis should 
include:
    (a) The probable cost to the Government of each proposal, including 
any recommended additions or reductions in materials, equipment, labor 
hours, direct rates and indirect rates. The probable cost should reflect 
the best estimate of the cost of any contract which might result from 
the offeror's proposal.

[[Page 216]]

    (b) The differences in business methods, operating procedures, and 
practices as they impact cost.
    (c) A level of confidence in the probable cost assessment for each 
proposal.
    (D) The cost realism analysis may result in adjustments to Mission 
Suitability scores in accordance with the procedure described in 
1815.608(a)(3)(B).
    (E) The cost or price evaluation, specifically the cost realism 
analysis, often requires a technical evaluation of proposed costs. 
Contracting officers may provide technical evaluators a copy of the cost 
volume or relevant information from it to use in the analysis.
    (a)(2) Past performance evaluation.
    (A) The Relevant Experience and Past Performance evaluation assesses 
the contractor's performance under previously awarded contracts. It 
should evaluate the company, not the individuals, involved with contract 
performance. Relevant Experience and Past Performance is not numerically 
scored, but is assigned an adjectival rating.
    (B) The evaluation may be limited to specific areas of past 
performance considered most germane for the instant acquisition. It may 
include any or all of the items listed in FAR 42.1501, and/or any other 
aspects of past performance considered pertinent to the solicitation 
requirements or challenges. Regardless of the areas of past performance 
selected for evaluation, the same areas shall be evaluated for all 
offerors in that acquisition.
    (C) The evaluation may consider past performance data provided by 
offerors and data from other sources. Questionnaires and interviews may 
be used to solicit assessments of the offeror's performance, as either a 
prime or subcontractor, from the offeror's previous customers.
    (D) All pertinent information, including customer assessments and 
any offeror rebuttals, will be made part of the source selection records 
and included in the evaluation.
    (a)(2) (iii) Firms without relevant experience or a past performance 
record shall not be given a proposal deficiency or weakness (see 
1815.610) and shall be given a neutral rating. If the adjectival rating 
system of 1815.608(a)(3)(A) is used for the Relevant Experience and Past 
Performance factor, a rating of ``Good'' shall be assigned in such 
cases.
    (3) Technical Evaluation.
    (A) Mission Suitability subfactors and the total Mission Suitability 
factor shall be evaluated using the following adjectival ratings, 
definitions and percentile ranges.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                              significantly detract from the offeror's response.

                                              have been found that outbalance any strengths that                
                                              exist.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (B) When contracting on a cost reimbursement basis, the Mission 
Suitability evaluation shall reflect the results of any required cost 
realism analysis performed under the cost/price factor. A structured 
approach shall be used to adjust Mission Suitability scores based on the 
degree of assessed cost realism. An example of such an approach would:
    (a) Establish a threshold at which Mission Suitability adjustments 
would start. The threshold should reflect the acquisition's estimating 
uncertainty (i.e., the higher the degree of estimating uncertainty, the 
higher the threshold);
    (b) Use a graduated scale that proportionally adjusts a proposal's 
Mission Suitability score for its assessed cost realism;

[[Page 217]]

    (c) Affect a significant number of points in order to encourage 
realistic pricing.
    (d) Calculate a Mission Suitability point adjustment based on the 
percentage difference between proposed and probable cost as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 Point

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) The contracting officer is authorized to make the determination 
to reject all proposals received in response to a solicitation.


<R05>
Sec. 1815.608-70  Identification of unacceptable proposals.

    (a) The contracting officer shall not complete the initial 
evaluation of any proposal when it is determined that the proposal is 
unacceptable because:
    (1) It does not represent a reasonable initial effort to address 
itself to the essential requirements of the RFP or clearly demonstrates 
that the offeror does not understand the requirements;
    (2) In research and development acquisitions, a substantial design 
drawback is evident in the proposal, and sufficient correction or 
improvement to consider the proposal acceptable would require virtually 
an entirely new technical proposal; or
    (3) It contains major technical or business deficiencies or 
omissions or out-of-line costs which discussions with the offeror could 
not reasonably be expected to cure.
    (b) The contracting officer shall document the rationale for 
discontinuing the initial evaluation of a proposal in accordance with 
this section.


<R05>
1815.608-71  Evaluation of a single proposal.

    (a) If only one proposal is received in response to the 
solicitation, the contracting officer shall determine if the 
solicitation was flawed or unduly restrictive and determine if the 
single proposal is an acceptable proposal. Based on these findings, the 
Source Selection Authority shall direct the contracting officer to:
    (1) Award without discussions provided the contracting officer 
determines that adequate price competition exists (see FAR 15.804-
1(b)(1)(ii));
    (2) Award after negotiating a mutually acceptable contract. (The 
requirement for submission of cost or pricing data shall be determined 
in accordance with FAR 15.804-1); or
    (3) Reject the proposal and cancel the solicitation.
    (b) The procedure in 1815.608-71(a) also applies when the number of 
proposals equals the number of awards contemplated or when only one 
acceptable proposal is received.


<R05>
1815.609  Competitive range. (NASA supplements paragraphs (a))

    (a) Proposals shall not be included in the competitive range when 
they do not have a reasonable chance of selection. To reduce unnecessary 
expense to both offerors and NASA, a total of no more than three 
proposals shall be a working goal in establishing the competitive range. 
Field installations may establish procedures for approval of competitive 
range determinations commensurate with the complexity or dollar value of 
an acquisition.


<R05>
1815.610  Written or oral discussions. (NASA supplements paragraph (c))

    (c)(2)(A) The contracting officer shall identify, and give offerors 
a reasonable opportunity to address, all weaknesses that have an adverse 
impact on the evaluation. Weaknesses are defined as deficiencies (see 
FAR 15.601) and other proposal inadequacies. Weaknesses may include all 
proposal areas that are inadequate for evaluation, contain contradictory 
statements, or strain credibility. However, minor irregularities, 
informalities, or apparent clerical mistakes are not considered 
weaknesses. They may be identified to offerors through the clarification 
technique defined in FAR 15.601, rather than discussions as contemplated 
in this section.
    (B) The contracting officer shall advise an offeror if, during 
written or oral discussions, an offeror introduces

[[Page 218]]

a new weakness. The offeror can be advised during the course of the 
discussions or as part of the request for BAFO.
    (C)The contracting officer shall identify any cost/price elements 
that do not appear to be justified and encourage offerors to submit 
their most favorable and realistic cost/price proposals, but shall not 
discuss, disclose, or compare cost/price elements of any other offeror. 
The contracting officer should question inadequate, conflicting, 
unrealistic or unsupported cost information; differences between the 
offeror's proposal and most probable cost assessments; cost realism 
concerns; differences between audit findings and proposed costs; 
proposed rates that are too high/low; and labor mixes that do not appear 
responsive to the requirements. No agreement on cost/price elements or a 
``bottom line'' is necessary.
    (c)(3)(A) The contracting officer shall discuss contract terms and 
conditions so that a ``model'' contract can be sent to each offeror with 
the request for BAFO. Any proposed technical performance capabilities 
above those specified in the RFP that have value to the Government and 
are considered proposal strengths should be discussed with the offeror 
and proposed for inclusion in that offeror's ``model'' contract. These 
items are not to be discussed with, or proposed to, other offerors. If 
the offeror declines to include these strengths in its ``model'' 
contract, the Government evaluators should reconsider their 
characterization as strengths.
    (B) In no case shall the contracting officer relax or amend RFP 
requirements for any offeror, without amending the RFG and permitting 
the other offerors an opportunity to propose against the relaxed 
requirements.


<R05>
1815.611  Best and Final Offers. (NASA supplements paragraphs (b), (c) and (d))

    (b) The request for BAFOs shall also:
    (i) Identify for any remaining weaknesses.
    (ii) Instruct offerors to incorporate all changes to their offers 
resulting from discussions, and require clear traceability from initial 
proposals;
    (iii) Require offerors to complete and execute the ``model'' 
contract, which includes any special provisions or performance 
capabilities the offeror proposed above those specified in the RFP;
    (iv) Caution offerors against unsubstantiated changes to their 
proposals; and
    (v) Establish a page limit for BAFOs.
    (c)(i) Approval of the Associate Administrator for Procurement (Code 
HS) is required to reopen discussions for acquisitions of $50 million or 
more.
    (ii) Approval of the procurement officer is required for all other 
acquisitions.
    (d)(i) Proposals are rescored based on BAFO evaluations. Scoring 
changes between initial and BAFO proposals shall be clearly traceable.
    (ii) All significant evaluation findings shall be fully documented 
and considered in the source selection decision. A clear and logical 
audit trail shall be maintained for the rationale for ratings and 
scores, including a detailed account of the decisions leading to the 
selection. Selection is made on the basis of the evaluation criteria 
established in the RFP.
    (iii) Prior to award, the SSA shall sign a source selection 
statement that clearly and succinctly justifies the selection. Source 
selection statements must describe: The acquisition; the SEB evaluation 
procedures; the substance of the Mission Suitability evaluation; and the 
evaluation of the Cost/Price and Relevant Experience and Past 
Performance factors. The statement also addresses unacceptable 
proposals, the competitive range determination, late proposals, or any 
other considerations pertinent to the decision. The statement shall not 
reveal any confidential business information. Except for certain major 
system acquisition competitions (see 1815.1006-70), source selection 
statements shall be releasable to competing offerors and the general 
public upon request. The statement shall be available to the Debriefing 
Official to use in postaward debriefing of unsuccessful offerors and 
shall be provided to debriefed offerors upon request.
    (iv) Once the selection decision is made, the contracting officer 
shall,

[[Page 219]]

without post-selection negotiations, award the contract.

<R05>
1815.612  Formal source selection. (NASA supplements paragraph (c))

    (c) The requirement for a source selection evaluation plan may be 
satisfied by incorporating the information required by 1815.605-71 into 
the source selection plan. The consolidated plan shall be approved by 
the source selection authority.
[62 FR 14017, Mar. 25, 1997]


<R05>
1815.612-70  NASA formal source selection.

    (a) The source evaluation board (SEB) procedures shall be used for 
those acquisitions identified in 1815.602(a)(i)(A).
    (b) General. The SEB assists the SSA in decisionmaking by providing 
expert analyses of the offerors' proposals in relation to the evaluation 
factors, subfactors, and elements contained in the solicitation. The SEB 
will prepare and present its findings to the SSA, avoiding trade-off 
judgments among either the individual offerors or among the evaluation 
factors. The SEB will not make recommendations for selection to the SSA.
    (c) Designation. (1) The SEB shall be comprised of competent 
individuals fully qualified to identify the strengths, weaknesses, and 
risks associated with proposals submitted in response to the 
solicitation. The SEB shall be appointed as early as possible in the 
acquisition process, but not later than acquisition plan approval.
    (2) While SEB participants are normally drawn from the cognizant 
installation, personnel from other NASA installations or other 
Government agencies may participate. When it is necessary to disclose 
the proposal (in whole or in part) outside the Government, approval 
shall be obtained in accordance with NFS 1815.413-2.
    (3) When Headquarters retains SSA authority, the Headquarters Office 
of Procurement (Code HS) must concur on the SEB appointments. 
Qualifications of voting members, including functional title, grade 
level, and related SEB experience, shall be provided.
    (d) Organization. (1) The organization of an SEB is tailored to the 
requirements of the particular acquisition. This can range from the 
simplest situation, where the SEB conducts the evaluation and fact-
finding without the use of committees or panels/consultants (as 
described in 1815.612-70(d) (4) and (5)), to a highly complex situation 
involving a major acquisition where two or more committees are formed 
and these, in turn, are assisted by special panels or consultants in 
particular areas. The number of committees or panels/ consultants shall 
be kept to a minimum.
    (2) The SEB Chairperson is the principal operating executive of the 
SEB. The Chairperson is expected to manage the team efficiently without 
compromising the validity of the findings provided to the SSA as the 
basis for a sound selection decision.
    (3) The SEB Recorder functions as the principal administrative 
assistant to the SEB Chairperson and is principally responsible for 
logistical support and recordkeeping of SEB activities.
    (4) An SEB committee functions as a fact-finding arm of the SEB, 
usually in a broad grouping of related disciplines (e.g., technical or 
management). The committee evaluates in detail each proposal, or portion 
thereof, assigned by the SEB in accordance with the approved evaluation 
factors, subfactors, and elements, and summarizes its evaluation in a 
written report to the SEB. The committee will also respond to 
requirements assigned by the SEB, including further justification or 
reconsideration of its findings. Committee chairpersons shall manage the 
administrative and procedural matters of their committees.
    (5) An SEB panel or consultant functions as a fact-finding arm of 
the committee in a specialized area of the committee's responsibilities. 
Panels are established or consultants named when a particular area 
requires deeper analysis than the committee can provide.
    (6) The total of all such evaluators (committees, panels, 
consultants, etc. excluding SEB voting members and ex officio members) 
shall be limited to a

[[Page 220]]

maximum of 20 people, unless approved in writing by the procurement 
officer.
    (e) Voting members. (1) Voting members of the SEB shall include 
people who will have key assignments on the project to which the 
acquisition is directed. However, it is important that this should be 
tempered to ensure objectivity and to avoid an improper balance. It may 
even be appropriate to designate a management official from outside the 
project as SEB Chairperson.
    (2) Non-government personnel shall not serve as voting members of a 
NASA SEB.
    (3) The SEB shall review the findings of committees, panels or 
consultants and use its own collective judgment to develop the SEB 
evaluation findings reported to the SSA. All voting members of the SEB 
shall have equal status as rating officials.
    (4) SEB membership shall be limited to a maximum of 7 voting 
individuals. Wherever feasible, an assignment to SEB membership as a 
voting member shall be on a full-time basis. When not feasible, SEB 
membership shall take precedence over other duties.
    (5) The following people shall be voting members of all SEBs:
    (i) Chairperson.
    (ii) A senior, key technical representative for the project.
    (iii) An experienced procurement representative.
    (iv) A senior Safety & Mission Assurance (S&MA) representative, as 
appropriate.
    (v) Committee chairpersons (except where this imposes an undue 
workload).
    (f) Ex officio members.
    (1) The number of nonvoting ex officio (advisory) members shall be 
kept as small as possible. Ex officio members should be selected for the 
experience and expertise they can provide to the SEB. Since their 
advisory role may require access to highly sensitive SEB material and 
findings, ex officio membership for persons other than those identified 
in 1815.612-70(f)(3) is discouraged.
    (2) Nonvoting ex officio members may state their views and 
contribute to the discussions in SEB deliberations, but they may not 
participate in the actual rating process. However, the SEB recorder 
should be present during rating sessions.
    (3) For field installation selections, the following shall be 
nonvoting ex officio members on all SEBs:
    (i) Chairpersons of SEB committees, unless designated as voting 
members.
    (ii) The procurement officer of the installation, unless designated 
a voting member.
    (iii) The contracting officer responsible for the acquisition, 
unless designated a voting member.
    (iv) The Chief Counsel and/or designee of the installation.
    (v) The installation small business specialist.
    (vi) The SEB recorder.
    (g) Evaluation. (1) If committees are used, the SEB Chairperson 
shall send them the proposals or portions thereof to be evaluated, along 
with instructions regarding the expected function of each committee, and 
all data considered necessary or helpful.
    (2) While oral reports may be given to the SEB, each committee shall 
submit a written report which should include the following:
    (i) Copies of individual worksheets and supporting comments to the 
lowest level evaluated;
    (ii) An evaluation sheet summarized for the committee as a whole; 
and
    (iii) A statement for each proposal describing any strengths or 
weaknesses which significantly affected the evaluation and stating any 
reservations or concerns, together with supporting rationale, which the 
committee or any of its members want to bring to the attention of the 
SEB.
    (3) Clear traceability must exist at all levels of the SEB process. 
All reports submitted by committees or panels will be retained as part 
of the SEB records.
    (4) Each voting SEB member shall thoroughly review each proposal and 
any committee reports and findings. The SEB shall rate or score the 
proposals for each evaluation factor and subfactor according to its own 
collective judgment, consistent with the approved evaluation plan. SEB 
minutes shall reflect this evaluation process.
    (h) SEB presentation. (1) The SEB Chairperson shall brief the SSA on 
the

[[Page 221]]

results of the SEB deliberations to permit an informed and objective 
selection of the best source(s) for the particular acquisition.
    (2) The presentation shall focus on the major strengths and 
weaknesses found in the proposals, the probable cost of each proposal, 
and any significant issues and problems identified by the SEB. This 
presentation must explain any applicable special standards of 
responsibility; evaluation factors, subfactors, and elements; the major 
strengths and weaknesses of the offerors; the Government cost estimate, 
if applicable; the offerors' proposed cost/price; the probable cost; the 
proposed fee arrangements; and the final adjectival ratings and scores

1815.805-5  Field pricing support. (NASA supplements paragraph (a))

    (a)(1)(A) The threshold for obtaining a field pricing report for 
cost reimbursement contracts is $1,000,000.
    (B) A field pricing report consists of a technical report and an 
audit report by the cognizant contract audit activity. Contracting 
officers should request a technical report from the ACO only if NASA 
resources are not available.
    (C) When the required participation of the ACO or auditor involves 
merely a verification of information, contracting officers should obtain 
this verification from the cognizant office by telephone rather than 
formal request of field pricing support.
    (D) When the threshold for requiring field pricing support is met 
and the cost proposal is for a product of a follow-on nature, 
contracting officers shall ensure that the following items, at a minimum 
are considered: actuals incurred under the previous contract, learning 
experience, technical and production analysis, and subcontract proposal 
analysis. This information may be obtained through NASA resources or the 
cognizant DCMC ACO or DCAA.
    (E) Requests for field pricing assistance may be made on NASA Form 
1434, Letter of Request for Pricing-Audit-Technical Evaluation Services.

1815.807  Prenegotiation objectives. (NASA supplements paragraph (b))

    (b)(i) Before conducting negotiations requiring installation or 
Headquarters review, contracting officers or their representatives shall 
prepare a prenegotiation position memorandum setting forth the 
technical, business, contractual, pricing, and other aspects to be 
negotiated.
    (ii) A prenegotiation position memorandum is not required for 
contracts awarded under the competitive negotiated procedures of FAR 
15.6 and 1815.6.
[62 FR 3465, Jan. 23, 1997, as amended at 62 FR 4467, Jan. 30, 1997]


<R05>
1815.807-70  Content of the prenegotiation position memorandum.

    The prenegotiation position memorandum (PPM) should fully explain 
the contractor and Government positions. Since the PPM will ultimately 
become the basis for negotiation, it should be structured to track to 
the price negotiation memorandum (see FAR 15.808 and 1815.808). In 
addition to the information described in FAR 15.807 and, as appropriate, 
15.808(a), the PPM should address the following subjects, as applicable, 
in the order presented:
    (a) Introduction. Include a description of the acquisition and a 
history of prior acquisitions for the same or similar items. Address the 
extent of competition and its results. Identify the contractor and place 
of performance (if not evident from the description of the acquisition). 
Document compliance with law, regulations and policy, including JOFOC, 
synopsis, EEO compliance, and current status of contractor systems (see 
FAR 15.808(a)(4)). In addition, the negotiation schedule should be 
addressed and the Government negotiation team members identified by name 
and position.
    (b) Type of contract contemplated. Explain the type of contract 
contemplated and the reasons for its suitability.
    (c) Special features and requirements. In this area, discuss any 
special features (and related cost impact) of the acquisition, including 
such items as--
    (1) Letter contract or precontract costs authorized and incurred;

[[Page 224]]

    (2) Results of preaward survey;
    (3) Contract option requirements;
    (4) Government property to be furnished;
    (5) Contractor/Government investment in facilities and equipment 
(and any modernization to be provided by the contractor/Government); and
    (6) Any deviations, special clauses, or unusual conditions 
anticipated, for example, unusual financing, warranties, EPA clauses and 
when approvals were obtained, if required.
    (d) Cost analysis. For the basic requirement, and any option, 
include--
    (1) A parallel tabulation, by element of cost and profit/fee, of the 
contractor's proposal and the Government's negotiation objective. The 
negotiation objective represents the fair and reasonable price the 
Government is willing to pay for the supplies/services. For each element 
of cost, compare the contractor's proposal and the Government position, 
explain the differences and how the Government position was developed, 
including the estimating assumptions and projection techniques employed, 
and how the positions differ in approach. Include a discussion of 
excessive wages found (if applicable) and their planned resolution. 
Explain how historical costs, including costs incurred under a letter 
contract (if applicable), were used in developing the negotiation 
objective;
    (2) Significant differences between the field pricing report 
(including any audit reports) and the negotiation objectives and/or 
contractor's proposal shall be highlighted and explained. For each 
proposed subcontract meeting the requirement of FAR 15.806-2(a), there 
shall be a discussion of the price and, when appropriate, cost analyses 
performed by the contracting officer, including the negotiation 
objective for each such subcontract. The discussion of each major 
subcontract shall include the type of subcontract, the degree of 
competition achieved by the prime contractor, the price and, when 
appropriate, cost analyses performed on the subcontractor's proposal by 
the prime contractor, and unusual or special pricing or finance 
arrangements, and the current status of subcontract negotiations.
    (3) The rationale for the Government's profit/fee objectives and, if 
appropriate, a completed copy of the NASA Form 634, Structured 
Approach--Profit/Fee Objective, and DD form 1861, Contract Facilities 
Capital Cost of Money, should be included. For incentive and award fee 
contracts, describe the planned arrangement in terms of share lines, 
ceilings, cost risk, and so forth, as applicable.
    (e) Negotiation approval sought. The PPM represents the Government's 
realistic assessment of the fair and reasonable price for the supplies 
and services to be acquired. If negotiations subsequently demonstrate 
that a higher dollar amount (or significant term or condition) is 
reasonable, the contracting officer shall document the rationale for 
such a change and request approval to amend the PPM from the original 
approval authority.


<R05>
1815.807-71  Installation reviews.

    Each contracting activity shall establish a formal system for the 
review of prenegotiation position memoranda. The scope of coverage, 
exact procedures to be followed, levels of management review, and 
contract file documentation requirements should be directly related to 
the dollar value and complexity of the acquisition. The primary purpose 
of these reviews is to ensure that the negotiator, or negotiation team, 
is thoroughly prepared to enter into negotiations with a well-conceived, 
realistic, and fair plan.


<R05>
1815.807-72  Headquarters reviews.

    (a) When a prenegotiation position has been selected for 
Headquarters review and approval, the contracting activity shall submit 
to the Office of Procurement (Code HS) one copy each of the 
prenegotiation position memorandum, the contractor's proposal, the 
Government technical evaluation, and all pricing reports (including any 
audit reports).
    (b) The required information described in paragraph (a) of this 
section shall be furnished to Headquarters as soon as practicable and 
sufficiently in advance of the planned commencement of negotiations to 
allow a reasonable period of time for Headquarters review. Electronic 
submittal is acceptable.

[[Page 225]]


<R05>
1815.808  Price negotiation memorandum. (NASA supplements paragraphs (a) and (b))

    (a)(i) The price negotiation memorandum (PNM) serves as a detailed 
summary of: the technical, business, contractual, pricing (including 
price reasonableness), and other elements of the contract negotiated; 
and the methodology and rationale used in arriving at the final 
negotiated agreement.
    (ii) A PNM is not required for a contract awarded under competitive 
negotiated procedures. However, the information required by FAR 15.808 
shall be reflected in the evaluation and selection documentation to the 
extent applicable.
    (b) When the PNM is a ``stand-alone'' document, it shall contain the 
information required by the FAR and NFS for both PPMs and PNMs. However, 
when a PPM has been prepared under 1815.807, the subsequent PNM need 
only provide any information required by FAR 15.808 that was not 
provided in the PPM, as well as any changes in the status of factors 
affecting cost elements (e.g., use of different rates, hours, 
subcontractors; wage rate determinations; or the current status of the 
contractor's systems).


<R04>
                         Subpart 1815.9--Profit


<R05>
1815.902  Policy. (NASA supplements paragraph (a)).

    (a)(1) The NASA structured approach for determining profit or fee 
objectives, described in 1815.970, shall be used to determine profit or 
fee objectives for conducting negotiations in those acquisitions that 
require cost analysis, except as indicated in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section.
    (2) The use of the NASA structured approach for profit or fee is not 
required for:
    (A) Architect-engineer contractors;
    (B) Management contracts for operation and/or maintenance of 
Government facilities;
    (C) Construction contracts;
    (D) Contracts primarily requiring delivery of material supplied by 
subcontractors;
    (E) Termination settlements;
    (F) Cost-plus-award-fee contracts (however, contracting officers may 
find it advantageous to perform a structured profit/fee analysis as an 
aid in arriving at an appropriate fee arrangement); and
    (G) Contracts having unusual pricing situations when the procurement 
officer determines in writing that the structured approach is 
unsuitable.


<R05>
1815.903  Contracting officer responsibilities. (NASA supplements paragraph (d))

    (d)(1)(ii) In architect-engineer contracts, the price or estimated 
cost and fee for services other than the production and delivery of 
designs, plans, drawings, and specifications, are not subject to the 6 
percent limitation set forth in FAR 15.903(d)(1).


<R05>
1815.970  NASA structured approach for profit or fee objective.


<R05>
1815.970-1  General.

    (a) The NASA structured approach for determining profit or fee 
objectives is a system of assigning weights to cost elements and other 
factors to calculate the objective. Contracting officers shall use NASA 
Form 634 to develop the profit or fee objective and shall use the weight 
ranges listed after each category and factor on the form after 
considering the factors in 1815.970-2 through 1815.970-4. The rationale 
supporting the assigned weights shall be documented in the PPM in 
accordance with 1815.807-70(d)(3).
    (b)(1) The structured approach was designed for determining profit 
or fee objectives for commercial organizations. However, the structured 
approach shall be used as a basis for arriving at fee objectives for 
nonprofit organizations (FAR subpart 31.7), excluding educational 
institutions (FAR subpart 31.3), in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section. (It is NASA policy not to pay profit or fee on contracts 
with educational institutions.)
    (2) For contracts with nonprofit organizations under which profits 
or fees are involved, an adjustment of up to 3 percent shall be 
subtracted from the total profit/fee objective. In developing this 
adjustment, it will be necessary to consider the following factors:
    (i) Tax position benefits;
    (ii) Granting of financing through letters of credit;

[[Page 226]]

    (iii) Facility requirements of the nonprofit organization; and
    (iv) Other pertinent factors that may work to either the advantage 
or disadvantage of the contractor in its position as a nonprofit 
organization.


<R05>
1815.970-2  Contractor effort.

    (a) This factor takes into account what resources are necessary and 
what the contractor must do to meet the contract performance 
requirements. The suggested cost categories under this factor are for 
reference purposes only. The format of individual proposals will vary, 
but these broad categories provide a sample structure for the evaluation 
of all categories of cost. Elements of cost shall be separately listed 
under the appropriate category and assigned a weight from the category 
range.
    (b) Regardless of the categories of cost defined for a specific 
acquisition, neither the cost of facilities nor the amount calculated 
for the cost of money for facilities capital shall be included as part 
of the cost base in column 1. (a) in the computation of profit or fee.
    (c) Evaluation of this factor requires analyzing the cost content of 
the proposed contract as follows:
    (1) Material acquisition (subcontracted items, purchased parts, and 
other material). (i) Consider the managerial and technical efforts 
necessary for the prime contractor to select subcontractors and 
administer subcontracts, including efforts to introduce and maintain 
competition. These evaluations shall be performed for purchases of raw 
materials or basic commodities; purchases of processed material, 
including all types of components of standard of near-standard 
characteristics; and purchases of pieces, assemblies, subassemblies, 
special tooling, and other products special to the end item. In 
performing the evaluation, also consider whether the contractor's 
purchasing program makes a substantial contribution to the performance 
of a contract through the use of subcontracting programs involving many 
sources, new complex components and instrumentation, incomplete 
specifications, and close surveillance by the prime contractor.
    (ii) Recognized costs proposed as direct material costs, such as 
scrap charges, shall be treated as material for profit/fee evaluation. 
If intracompany transfers are accepted at price in accordance with FAR 
31.205-26(e), they shall be evaluated as a single element under the 
material acquisition category. For other intracompany transfers, the 
constituent elements of cost shall be identified and weighted under the 
appropriate cost category, i.e., material, labor, and overhead.
    (2) Direct labor (engineering, service, manufacturing, and other 
labor). (i) Analysis of the various items of cost should include 
evaluation of the comparative quality and level of the engineering 
talents, service contract labor, manufacturing skills, and experience to 
be employed. In evaluating engineering labor for the purpose of 
assigning profit/fee weights, consideration should be given to the 
amount of notable scientific talent or unusual or scarce engineering 
talent needed, in contrast to journeyman engineering effort or 
supporting personnel.
    (ii) Evaluate service contract labor in a like manner by assigning 
higher weights to engineering, professional, or highly technical skills 
and lower weights to semiprofessional or other skills required for 
contract performance.
    (iii) Similarly, the variety of engineering, manufacturing and other 
types of labor skills required and the contractor's manpower resources 
for meeting these requirements should be considered. For purposes of 
evaluation, subtypes of labor (for example, quality control, and 
receiving and inspection) proposed separately from engineering, service, 
or manufacturing labor should be included in the most appropriate labor 
type. However, the same evaluation considerations as outlined in this 
section will be applied.
    (3) Overhead and general management (G&A). (i) Analysis of overhead 
and G&A includes the evaluation of the makeup of these expenses, how 
much they contribute to contract performance, and the degree of 
substantiation provided for the rates proposed in future years.
    (ii) Contracting officers should also consider the historical 
accuracy of the

[[Page 227]]

contractor's proposed overheads as well as the ability to control 
overhead pool expenses.
    (iii) The contracting officer, in an evaluation of the overhead rate 
of a contractor using a single indirect cost rate, should break out the 
applicable sections of the composite rate which could be classified as 
engineering overhead, manufacturing overhead, other overhead pools, and 
G&A expenses, and apply the appropriate weight.
    (4) Other costs. Include all other direct costs associated with 
contractor performance under this item, for example, travel and 
relocation, direct support, and consultants. Analysis of these items of 
cost should include their nature and how much they contribute to 
contract performance.


<R05>
1815.970-3  Other factors.

    (a) Cost risk. The degree of risk assumed by the contractor should 
influence the amount of profit or fee a contractor is entitled to 
anticipate. For example, if a portion of the risk has been shifted to 
the Government through cost-reimbursement or price redetermination 
provisions, unusual contingency provisions, or other risk reducing 
measures, the amount of profit or fee should be less than for 
arrangements under which the contractor assumes all the risk. This 
factor is one of the most important in arriving at prenegotiation 
profit/fee objectives.
    (1) Other risks on the part of the contractor, such as loss of 
reputation, losing a commercial market, or losing potential profit/fee 
in other fields, shall not be considered in this factor. Similarly, any 
risk on the part of the contracting office, such as the risk of not 
acquiring an effective space vehicle, is not within the scope of this 
factor.
    (2) The degree of cost responsibility assumed by the contractor is 
related to the share of total contract cost risk assumed by the 
contractor through the selection of contract type. The weight for risk 
by contract type would usually fall within the 0-to-3 percent range for 
cost-reimbursement contracts and 3-to-7 percent range for fixed-price 
contracts.
    (i) Within the ranges set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, 
a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract normally would not justify a reward for 
risk in excess of 0 percent, unless the contract contains cost risk 
features such as ceilings on overheads, etc. In such cases, up to 0.5 
percent may be justified. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts fill the 
remaining portion of the range, with weightings directly related to such 
factors as confidence in target cost, share ratio of fees, etc.
    (ii) The range for fixed-price type contracts is wide enough to 
accommodate the various types of fixed-price arrangements. Weighting 
should be indicative of the price risk assumed and the end item 
required, with only firm-fixed-price contracts with requirements for 
prototypes or hardware reaching the top end of the range.
    (3) The cost risk arising from contract type is not the only form of 
cost risk to consider.
    (i) The contractor's subcontracting program may have a significant 
impact on the contractor's acceptance of risk under a particular 
contract type. This consideration should be a part of the contracting 
officer's overall evaluation in selecting a weight to apply for cost 
risk. It may be determined, for instance, that the prime contractor has 
effectively transferred real cost risk to a subcontractor, and the 
contract cost risk weight may, as a result, be below the range that 
would otherwise apply for the contract type proposed. The contract cost 
risk weigh should not be lowered, however, merely on the basis that a 
substantial portion of the contract costs represents subcontracts unless 
those subcontract costs represent a substantial transfer of the 
contractor's risk.
    (ii) In making a contract cost risk evaluation in an acquisition 
that involves definitization of a letter contract, unpriced change 
orders, or unpriced orders under BOAs, consideration should be given to 
the effect on total contract cost risk as a result of having partial 
performance before definitization. Under some circumstances it may be 
reasoned that the total amount of cost risk has been effectively 
reduced. Under other circumstances it may be apparent that the 
contractor's cost risk is substantially unchanged. To be equitable, 
determination of a profit/fee weight for

[[Page 228]]

application to the total of all recognized costs, both incurred and yet 
to be expended, must be made with consideration of all attendant 
circumstances and should not be based solely on the portion of costs 
incurred, or percentage of work completed, before definitization.
    (b) Investment. NASA encourages its contractors to perform their 
contracts with a minimum of financial, facilities, or other assistance 
from the Government. As such, it is the purpose of this factor to 
encourage the contractor to acquire and use its own resources to the 
maximum extent possible. Evaluation of this factor should include an 
analysis of the contractor's facilities and the frequency of payments.
    (1) To evaluate how facilities contribute to the profit/fee 
objective requires knowledge of the level of facilities utilization 
needed for contract performance, the source and financing of the 
required facilities, and the overall cost effectiveness of the 
facilities offered. Contractors furnishing their own facilities that 
significantly contribute to lower total contract costs should be 
provided additional profit/fee. On the other hand, contractors that rely 
on the Government to provide or finance needed facilities should receive 
a correspondingly lower profit/fee. Cases between the above examples 
should be evaluated on their merits, with either a positive or negative 
adjustment, as appropriate, in the profit/fee objective. However, where 
a highly facilitized contractor is to perform a contract that does not 
benefit from this facilitization, or when a contractor's use of its 
facilities has a minimum cost impact on the contract, profit/fee need 
not be adjusted.
    (2) In analyzing payments, consider the frequency of payments by the 
Government to the contractor and unusual payments. The key to this 
weighting is proper consideration of the impact the contract will have 
on the contractor's cash flow. Generally, negative consideration should 
be given for payments more frequent than monthly, with maximum reduction 
being given as the contractor's working capital approaches zero. 
Positive consideration should be given for payments less frequent than 
monthly.
    (c) Performance. The contractor's past and present performance 
should be evaluated in such areas as product quality, meeting 
performance schedules, efficiency in cost control (including the need 
for and reasonableness of costs incurred), accuracy and reliability of 
previous cost estimates, degree of cooperation by the contractor (both 
business and technical), timely processing of changes and compliance 
with other contractual provisions.
    (d) Subcontract program management. Subcontract program management 
includes evaluation of the contractor's commitment to its competition 
program and its past and present performance in competition in 
subcontracting. If a contractor has consistently achieved excellent 
results in these areas in comparison with other contractors in similar 
circumstances, such performance merits a proportionately greater 
opportunity for profit or fee. Conversely, a poor record in this regard 
should result in a lower profit or fee.
    (e) Federal socioeconomic programs. In addition to rewarding 
contractors for unusual initiative in supporting Government 
socioeconomic programs, failure or unwillingness on the part of the 
contractor to support these programs should be viewed as evidence of 
poor performance for the purpose of establishing this profit/fee 
objective factor.
    (f) Special situations. (1) Occasionally, unusual contract pricing 
arrangements are made with the contractor under which it agrees to 
accept a lower profit or fee for changes or modifications within a 
prescribed dollar value. In such circumstances, the contractor should 
receive favorable consideration in developing the profit/fee objective.
    (2) This factor need not be limited to situations that increase 
profit/fee levels. A negative consideration may be appropriate when the 
contractor is expected to obtain spin-off benefits as a direct result of 
the contract, for example, products with commercial application.

1815.970-4  Facilities capital cost of money.

    (a) When facilities capital cost of money is included as an item of 
cost in the contractor's proposal, it shall not

[[Page 229]]

be included in the cost base for calculating profit/fee. In addition, a 
reduction in the profit/fee objective shall be made in the amount equal 
to the facilities capital cost of money allowed in accordance with FAR 
31.205-10(a)(2).
    (b) CAS 417, Cost of money as an element of the cost of capital 
assets under construction, should not appear in contract proposals. 
These costs are included in the initial value of a facility for purposes 
of calculating depreciation under CAS 414.

1815.1004  Notification to successful offeror.

    The reference to notice of award in FAR 15.1004 on negotiated 
acquisitions is a generic one. It relates only to the formal 
establishment of a contractual document obligating both the Government 
and the offeror. The notice is effected by the transmittal of a fully 
approved and executed definitive contract document, such as the award 
portion of SF 33, SF 26, SF 1449, or SF 1447, or a letter contract when 
a definitized contract instrument is not available but the urgency of 
the requirement necessitates immediate performance. In this latter 
instance, the procedures in 1816.603 for approval and issuance of letter 
contracts shall be followed:

    (a) When an acquisition is conducted in accordance with the Major 
System acquisition procedures in part 1834 and multiple offerors are 
selected, the debriefing will be limited in such a manner that it does 
not prematurely disclose innovative concepts, designs, and approaches of 
the successful offerors that would result in a transfusion of ideas.
    (b) When Phase B awards are made for alternative system design 
concepts, the source selection statements shall not be released to 
competing offerors or the general public until the release of the source 
selection statement for Phase C/D without the approval of the Associate 
Administrator for Procurement (Code HS).

    (a) In addition to the approval requirements in the prescriptions at 
FAR 52.216-2 through 52.216-4, the contracting officer shall coordinate 
with the installation's Deputy Chief Financial Officer (Finance) before 
exceeding the ten-percent limit in paragraph (c)(1) of the clauses at 
FAR 52.216-2 through 52.216-4.
    (d)(2) Contracting officers shall contact the Office of Procurement,

<R04>
              Subpart 1816.3--Cost-Reimbursement Contracts


<R05>
1816.303-70  Cost-sharing contracts.

    (a) Cost-sharing with for-profit organizations. (1) Cost sharing by 
for-profit organizations is mandatory in any contract for basic or 
applied research resulting from an unsolicited proposal, and may be 
accepted in any other contract when offered by the proposing 
organization. The requirement for cost-sharing may be waived when the 
contracting officer determines in writing that the contractor has no 
commercial, production, education, or service activities that would 
benefit from the results of the research, and the contractor has no 
means of recovering its shared costs on such projects.
    (2) The contractor's cost-sharing may be any percentage of the 
project cost. In determining the amount of cost-sharing, the contracting 
officer shall consider the relative benefits to the contractor and the 
Government. Factors that should be considered include--
    (i) The potential for the contractor to recover its contribution 
from non-Federal sources;
    (ii) The extent to which the particular area of research requires 
special stimulus in the national interest; and
    (iii) The extent to which the research effort or result is likely to 
enhance the contractor's capability, expertise, or competitive 
advantage.
    (b) Cost-sharing with not-for-profit organizations. (1) Costs to 
perform research stemming from an unsolicited proposal by universities 
and other educational or not-for-profit institutions are usually fully 
reimbursed. When the contracting officer determines that

[[Page 231]]

there is a potential for significant benefit to the institution cost-
sharing will be considered.
    (2) The contracting officer will normally limit the institution's 
share to no more than 10 percent of the project's cost.
    (c) Implementation. Cost-sharing shall be stated as a minimum 
percentage of the total allowable costs of the project. The contractor's 
contributed costs may not be charged to the Government under any other 
contract or grant, including allocation to other contracts and grants as 
part of an independent research and development program.

1816.307  Contract clauses. (NASA supplements paragraphs (a), (b), (d), and (g)).

    (a) In paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(B) of the Allowable Cost and Payment 
clause at FAR 52.216-7, the period of years may be increased to 
correspond with any statutory period of limitation applicable to claims 
of third parties against the contractor; provided, that a corresponding 
increase is made in the period for retention of records required in 
paragraph (f) of the clause at FAR 52.215-2, Audit and Records--
Negotiation.
    (b) In solicitations and contracts containing the clause at FAR 
52.216-8, Fixed Fee, the Schedule shall include appropriate terms, if 
any, for provisional billing against fee.
    (d) In solicitations and contracts containing the clause at FAR 
52.216-10, Incentive Fee, the Schedule shall include appropriate terms, 
if any, for provisional billing against fee.
    (g) In paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of the Allowable Cost and Payment--
Facilities clause at FAR 52.216-13, the period of years may be increased 
to correspond with any statutory period of limitation applicable to 
claims of third parties against the contractor; provided, that a 
corresponding increase is made in the period for retention of records 
required in paragraph (f) of the clause at FAR 52.215-2, Audit and 
Records--Negotiation.


<R05>
1816.307-70  NASA contract clauses.

    (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.216-73, 
Estimated Cost and Cost Sharing, in each contract in which costs are 
shared by the contractor pursuant to 1816.303-70.
    (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause substantially as 
stated at 1852.216-74, Estimated Cost and Fixed Fee, in cost-plus-fixed-
fee contracts.
    (c) The contracting officer may insert the clause at 1852.216-75, 
Payment of Fixed Fee, in cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts. Modifications to 
the clause are authorized.
    (d) The contracting officer may insert the clause at 1852.216-81, 
Estimated Cost, in cost-no-fee contracts that are not cost sharing or 
facilities contracts.
    (e) The contracting officer may insert a clause substantially as 
stated at 1852.216-87, Submission of Vouchers for Payment, in cost-
reimbursement solicitations and contracts.
    (f) When either FAR clause 52.216-7, Allowable Cost and Payment, or 
FAR clause 52.216-13, Allowable Cost and Payment--Facilities, is 
included in the contract, as prescribed at FAR 16.307 (a) and (g), the 
contracting officer should include the clause at 1852.216-89, Assignment 
and Release Forms.


<R04>
                   Subpart 1816.4--Incentive Contracts


<R05>
1816.402  Application of pre-determined, formula-type incentives.


<R05>
1816.402-2  Technical performance incentives.


<R05>
1816.402-270  NASA technical performance incentives.

    (a) A performance incentive shall be included in all contracts where 
the primary deliverable(s) is (are) hardware and where total estimated 
cost and fee is greater than $25 million unless it is determined that 
the nature of the acquisition (for example, commercial off-

[[Page 232]]

the-shelf computers) would not effectively lend itself to a performance 
incentive. Any exception to this requirement shall be approved in 
writing by the Center Director. Performance incentives may be included 
in hardware contracts valued under $25 million at the discretion of the 
procurement officer. Performance incentives, which are objective and 
measure hardware performance after delivery and acceptance, are separate 
from other incentives, such as cost or delivery incentives.
    (b) When a performance incentive is used, it shall be structured to 
be both positive and negative based on hardware performance after 
delivery and acceptance. In doing so, the contract shall establish a 
standard level of performance based on the salient hardware performance 
requirement. This standard performance level is normally the contract's 
minimum performance requirement. No incentive amount is earned at this 
standard performance level. Discrete units of measurement based on the 
same performance parameter shall be identified for performance both 
above and below the standard. Specific incentive amounts shall be 
associated with each performance level from maximum beneficial 
performance (maximum positive incentive) to minimal beneficial 
performance or total failure (maximum negative incentive). The 
relationship between any given incentive, both positive and negative, 
and its associated unit of measurement should reflect the value to the 
Government of that level of hardware performance. The contractor should 
not be rewarded for above-standard performance levels that are of no 
benefit to the Government.
    (c) The final calculation of the performance incentive shall be done 
when hardware performance, as defined in the contract, ceases or when 
the maximum positive incentive is reached. When hardware performance 
ceases below the standard established in the contract, the Government 
shall calculate the amount due and the contractor shall pay the 
Government that amount. Once hardware performance exceeds the standard, 
the contractor may request payment of the incentive amount associated 
with a given level of performance, provided that such payments shall not 
be more frequent than monthly. When hardware performance ceases above 
the standard level of performance, or when the maximum positive 
incentive is reached, the Government shall calculate the final 
performance incentive earned and unpaid and promptly remit it to the 
contractor. The exclusion at FAR 16.405(e)(3) does not apply to 
decisions made as to the amount(s) of positive or negative incentive.
    (d) When the deliverable hardware lends itself to multiple, 
meaningful measures of performance, multiple performance incentives may 
be established. When the contract requires the sequential delivery of 
several hardware items (e.g.. multiple spacecraft), separate performance 
incentive structures may be established to parallel the sequential 
delivery and use of the deliverables.
    (e) In determining the value of the maximum performance incentives 
available, the contracting officer shall follow the following rules.
    (1) The sum of the maximum positive performance incentive and other 
fixed or earnable fees on the contract shall not exceed the limitations 
in FAR 15.903(c).
    (2) For an award fee contract.
    (i) The individual values of the maximum positive performance 
incentive and the total potential award fee (including any base fee) 
shall each be at least one-third of the total potential contract fee. 
The remaining one-third of the total potential contract fee may be 
divided between award fee and the maximum performance incentive at the 
discretion of the contracting officer.
    (ii) The maximum negative performance incentive for research and 
development hardware (e.g., the first and second units) shall be equal 
in amount to the total earned award fee (including any base fee). The 
maximum negative performance incentives for production hardware (e.g., 
the third and all subsequent units of any hardware items) shall be equal 
in amount to the total potential award fee (including any base fee). 
Where one contract contains both cases described above, any base fee

[[Page 233]]

shall be allocated reasonably among the items.
    (3) For cost reimbursement contracts other than award fee contracts, 
the maximum negative performance incentives shall not exceed the total 
earned fee under the contract.

1816.405-2  Cost-plus-award-fee (CPAF) contracts.

[62 FR 3478, Jan. 23, 1997. Redesignated at 62 FR 36706, July 9, 1997]


<R05>
1816.405-270  CPAF contracts.

    (a) For purposes of this subsection, ``performance based 
contracting'' means effort which can be contractually defined so that 
the results of the contractor's effort can be objectively measured in 
terms of technical and quality achievement, schedule progress or cost 
performance. ``Nonperformance based contracting'' means contractor 
effort that cannot be objectively measured but is evaluated based on 
subjective, qualitative assessments (e.g., controlling changes or 
interfacing with other agencies, contractors and international 
organizations).
    (b)(1) Normally, award fee incentives are not used when contract 
requirements can be defined in sufficient detail to allow for 
performance based contracting. If incentives are considered necessary, 
objectively measured incentives as described in FAR 16.402 are 
preferred.
    (2) Award fee incentives may be used as follows:
    (i) As a CPAF contract where a cost reimbursement contract is 
appropriate and none of the requirements can be defined to permit 
performance based contracting;
    (ii) As a CPAF line item for nonperformance based requirements in 
conjunction with a non-CPAF line item(s) for performance based 
requirements. In this instance, fees for the performance based and 
nonperformance based requirements shall be developed separately IAW FAR 
15-9 and 1815.9; and
    (iii) Under a performance-based contract when it is determined to be 
necessary to motivate the contractor toward exceptional performance (see 
FAR 16.405-2(b)(ii)) and the increased level of performance justifies 
the additional administrative expense. When an award fee incentive is 
used in this instance, the basic contract type shall be other than CPAF 
(e.g., CPIF or FPIF). The potential award fee shall not be used to 
incentivize cost performance.
    (3) Award fee incentives shall not be used with a cost-plus-fixed-
fee (CPFF) contract.
    (c) Use of an award fee incentive shall be approved in writing by 
the procurement officer. The procurement officer's approval shall 
include a discussion of the other types of contracts considered and 
shall indicate why an award fee incentive is the appropriate choice. 
Award fee incentives should be used on contracts with a total estimated 
cost and fee greater than $2 million per year. The procurement officer 
may authorize use of award fee for lower-valued acquisitions, but should 
do so only in exceptional situations, such as contract requirements 
having direct health or safety impacts, where the judgmental assessment 
of the quality of contractor performance is critical.
[62 FR 3478, Jan. 23, 1997. Redesignated and amended at 62 FR 36706, 
July 9, 1997]


<R05>
1816.405-271  Base fee.

    (a) A base fee shall not be used on CPAF contracts for which the 
periodic award fee evaluations are final (1816.405-273(a)). In these 
circumstances, contractor performance during any award fee period is 
independent of and has no effect on subsequent performance periods or 
the final product/results at contract completion. For other contracts, 
such as those for hardware or software development, the procurement 
officer may authorize the use of a base fee not to exceed 3 percent. 
Base fee shall not be used when an award fee incentive is used in 
conjunction with a performance based contract structure, such as an 
incentive fee arrangement.
    (b) When a base fee is authorized for use in a CPAF contract, it 
shall be paid only if the final award fee evaluation is

[[Page 234]]

``satisfactory'' or better. (See 1816.405-273 and 1816.405-275) Pending 
final evaluation, base fee may be paid during the life of the contract 
at defined intervals on a provisional basis. If the final award fee 
evaluation is ``poor/unsatisfactory'', all provisional base fee payments 
shall be refunded to the Government.
[62 FR 3478, Jan. 23, 1997. Redesignated and amended at 62 FR 36706, 
July 9, 1997]


<R05>
1816.405-272  Award fee evaluation periods.

    (a) Award fee evaluation periods should be at least 6 months in 
length. When appropriate, the procurement officer may authorize shorter 
evaluation periods after ensuring that the additional administrative 
costs associated with the shorter periods are offset by benefits 
accruing to the Government. Where practicable, such as developmental 
contracts with defined performance milestones (e.g., Preliminary Design 
Review, Critical Design Review, initial system test), establishing 
evaluation periods at conclusion of the milestones rather than calendar 
dates, or in combination with calendar dates should be considered. In no 
case shall an evaluation period be longer than 12 months.
    (b) A portion of the total available award fee contract shall be 
allocated to each of the evaluation periods. This allocation may result 
in an equal or unequal distribution of fee among the periods. The 
contracting officer should consider the nature of each contract and the 
incentive effects of fee distribution in determining the appropriate 
allocation structure.
[62 FR 3478, Jan. 23, 1997. Redesignated at 62 FR 36706, July 9, 1997]


<R05>
1816.405-273  Award fee evaluations.

    (a) Award fee evaluations are either interim or final. On contracts 
where the contract deliverable is the performance of a service over any 
given time period, contractor performance is often definitively 
measurable within each evaluation period. In these cases, all 
evaluations are final, and the contractor keeps the fee earned in any 
period regardless of the evaluations of subsequent periods. Unearned 
award fee in any given period in a service contract is lost and shall 
not be carried forward, or ``rolled-over,'' into subsequent periods.
    (b) On other contracts, such as those for end item deliverables 
where the true quality of contractor performance cannot be measured 
until the end of the contract, only the last evaluation is final. At 
that point, the total contract award fee pool is available, and the 
contractor's total performance is evaluated against the award fee plan 
to determine total earned award fee. In addition, interim evaluations 
are done to monitor performance prior to contract completion and provide 
feedback to the contractor on the Government's assessment of the quality 
of its performance. Interim evaluations are also used to establish the 
basis for making interim award fee payments. These interim payments are 
superseded by the fee determination made in the final evaluation at 
contract completion. The Government will then pay the contractor, or the 
contractor will refund to the Government, the difference between the 
final award fee determination and the cumulative interim fee payment.
    (c) Provisional award fee payments, i.e., payments made within 
evaluation periods, may be included in the contract and should be 
negotiated on a case-by-case basis. The amount of the provisional award 
fee payment is determined by applying the lesser of the prior period's 
interim evaluation score (see 1816.405-275) or 80 percent of the fee 
allocated to the current period. The provisional award fee payments are 
superseded by the fee determinations made at the conclusion of each 
award fee performance period.
    (d) The Fee Determination Official's rating for both interim and 
final evaluations will be provided to the contractor within 45 calendar 
days of the end of the period being evaluated. Any fee, interim or 
final, due to the contractor will be paid no later than 60 calendar days 
after the end of the period being evaluated.
    (e) Interim and final evaluations may be used to provide past 
performance information during the source selection

[[Page 235]]

process and should be marked and controlled as ``Source Selection 
Information.''
[62 FR 3478, Jan. 23, 1997. Redesignated and amended at 62 FR 36706, 
36707, July 9, 1997]


<R05>
1816.405-274  Award fee evaluation factors.

    (a) Explicit evaluation factors shall be established for each award 
fee period.
    (b) Evaluation factors will be developed by the contracting officer 
based upon the characteristics of an individual procurement. Normally, 
technical and schedule considerations will be included in all CPAF 
contracts as evaluation factors. Cost control shall be included as an 
evaluation factor in all CPAF contracts. When explicit evaluation factor 
weightings are used, cost control shall be no less than 25 percent of 
the total weighted evaluation factors. The predominant consideration of 
the cost control evaluation should be a measurement of the contractor's 
performance against the negotiated estimated cost of the contract. This 
estimated cost may include the value of undefinitized change orders when 
appropriate.
    (c) In rare circumstances, contract costs may increase for reasons 
outside the contractor's control and for which the contractor is not 
entitled to an equitable adjustment. One example is a weather-related 
launch delay on a launch support contract. The Government shall take 
such situations into consideration when evaluating contractor cost 
control.
    (d) Emphasis on cost control should be balanced against other 
performance requirement objectives. The contractor should not be 
incentivized to pursue cost control to the point that overall 
performance is significantly degraded. For example, incentivizing an 
underrun that results in direct negative impacts on technical 
performance, safety, or other critical contract objectives is both 
undesirable and counterproductive. Therefore, evaluation of cost control 
shall conform to the following guidelines:
    (1) Normally, the contractor should be given a score of 0 for cost 
control when there is a significant overrun within its control. However, 
the contractor may receive higher scores for cost control if the overrun 
is insignificant. Scores should decrease sharply as the size of the 
overrun increases. In any evaluation of contractor overrun performance, 
the Government shall consider the reasons for the overrun and assess the 
extent and effectiveness of the contractor's efforts to control or 
mitigate the overrun.
    (2) The contractor should normally be rewarded for an underrun 
within its control, up to the maximum score allocated for cost control, 
provided the average numerical rating for all other award fee evaluation 
factors is 81 or greater (see 1816.405-275). An underrun shall be 
rewarded as if the contractor has met the estimated cost of the contract 
(see 1816.405-274(d)(3)) when the average numerical rating for all other 
factors is less than 81 but greater than 60.
    (3) The contractor should be rewarded for meeting the estimated cost 
of the contract, but not to the maximum score allocated for cost 
control, to the degree that the contractor has prudently managed costs 
while meeting contract requirements. No award shall be given in this 
circumstance unless the average numerical rating for all other award fee 
evaluation factors is 61 or greater.
    (e) When an AF arrangement is used in conjunction with a performance 
based contract structure (see 1816.405-270(b)(2)(iii)), the award fee's 
cost control factor will only apply to a subjective assessment of the 
contractor's efforts to control costs and not the actual cost outcome 
incentivized under the basic contract type (e.g., CPIF, FPIF).
    (f) The contractor's performance against the subcontracting plan 
incorporated in the contract shall also be evaluated. Small 
disadvantaged business utilization may be an area of particular 
emphasis, including the contractor's achievements in subcontracting high 
technology efforts as well as the contractor's performance under the 
Mentor-Protege Program, if applicable. The evaluation weight given to 
subcontracting plan performance should be significant (up to 15 percent 
of

[[Page 236]]

available award fee). It should motivate the contractor to focus 
management attention to subcontracting with small, small disadvantaged, 
and women-owned small business concerns to the maximum extent 
practicable consistent with efficient contract performance.
    (g) Only the award fee performance evaluation factors set forth in 
the performance evaluation plan shall be used to determine award fee 
scores.
    (h) The Government may unilaterally modify the applicable award fee 
performance evaluation factors and performance evaluation areas prior to 
the start of an evaluation period. The contracting officer shall notify 
the contractor in writing of any such changes 30 days prior to the start 
of the relevant evaluation period.

<R05>
1816.405-275  Award fee evaluation scoring.

    (a) A scoring system of 0-100 shall be used for all award fee 
ratings. Award fee earned is determined by applying the numerical score 
to the award fee pool. For example, a score of 85 yields an award fee of 
85 percent of the award fee pool. No award fee shall be paid unless the 
total score is 61 or greater.
    (b) The following standard adjectival ratings and the associated 
numerical scores shall be used on all award fee contracts.
    (1) Excellent (100-91): Of exceptional merit; exemplary performance 
in a timely, efficient, and economical manner; very minor (if any) 
deficiencies with no adverse effect on overall performance.
    (2) Very good (90-81): Very effective performance, fully responsive 
to contract requirements accomplished in a timely, efficient, and 
economical manner for the most part; only minor deficiencies.
    (3) Good (80-71): Effective performance; fully responsive to 
contract requirements; reportable deficiencies, but with little 
identifiable effect on overall performance.
    (4) Satisfactory (70-61): Meets or slightly exceeds minimum 
acceptable standards; adequate results; reportable deficiencies with 
identifiable, but not substantial, effects on overall performance.
    (5) Poor/Unsatisfactory (less than 61): Does not meet minimum 
acceptable standards in one or more areas; remedial action required in 
one or more areas; deficiencies in one or more areas which adversely 
affect overall performance.
    (c) As a benchmark for evaluation, in order to be rated 
``Excellent,'' the contractor must be under cost, on or ahead of 
schedule, and have provided excellent technical performance.
    (d) A scoring system appropriate for the circumstances of the 
individual contract requirement should be developed. Weighted scoring is 
recommended. In this system, each evaluation factor (e.g., technical, 
schedule, cost control) is assigned a specific percentage weighting with 
the cumulative weightings of all factors totaling 100. During the award 
fee evaluation, each factor is scored from 0-100 according to the 
ratings defined in 1816.405-275(b). The numerical score for each factor 
is then multiplied by the weighting for that factor to determine the 
weighted score. For example, if the technical factor has a weighting of 
60 percent and the numerical score for that factor is 80, the weighted 
technical score is 48 (80 x 60 percent). The weighted scores for each 
evaluation factor are then added to determine the total award fee score.

<R05>
1817.7000  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart contains policies and procedures, developed jointly by 
NASA and DOD, for acquisition of supplies or

[[Page 240]]

services by NASA from or through the Military Departments.


<R05>
1817.70001  Authorization and policy.

    (a)(1) NASA is authorized by the National Aeronautics and Space Act 
of 1958 (42 U.S.C. 2451 et seq.) to use the acquisition services, 
personnel, equipment, and facilities of the Military Departments, with 
their consent and with or without reimbursement, and, on a similar 
basis, to cooperate with the Military Departments in the use of 
acquisition services, equipment, and facilities.
    (2) Although the Space Act provides interagency transaction 
authority nearly equivalent to the Economy Act, NASA has elected to 
conform its implementation of the Space Act to the requirements of the 
Economy Act. Therefore, unless exempt from the Economy Act for reasons 
other than the general authority of the Space Act, interagency 
acquisitions shall be supported by an Economy Act Determination and 
Finding (see FAR 17.503 and 1817.503). This requirement applies to all 
acquisitions from the Military Departments or other agencies.
    (b) The Military Departments have agreed to cooperate fully with 
NASA in making their acquisition services, equipment, personnel, and 
facilities available on the basis of mutual agreement.
    (c) The Military Departments have agreed not to claim reimbursement 
for administrative costs incident to acquisitions for NASA, except as 
may be otherwise agreed before the services are performed.
    (d) When procuring supplies or services for NASA or performing field 
service functions in support of NASA contracts, the Military Departments 
have agreed to use their own methods, except when otherwise required by 
the terms of the agreement involved.
    (e) The Military Departments normally will use their own funds when 
procuring supplies or services or performing services for NASA, and will 
not cite NASA funds on any Defense obligation or payment document.


<R05>
1817.7002  NASA-Defense Purchase Request and acceptance.

    (a) The NASA-Defense Purchase Request (NASA Form 523) shall be used 
by NASA contracting offices for requesting acquisition of supplies or 
services from all activities of the Military Departments. Individual 
NASA-Defense Purchase Requests shall be prepared in accordance with the 
instructions on the reverse of NASA Form 523 and shall be numbered in 
accordance with subpart 1804.71. The form shall not be used for 
requesting--
    (1) Block transfers of excess property between NASA and the Military 
Departments;
    (2) Performance by the Military Departments of field service 
functions related to NASA contracts; or
    (3) Items that the Military Departments normally purchase and stock 
for military use or in-house service, except when a DOD activity is 
willing to accept the form for these purposes. Supplies and services of 
this nature may be requisitioned using appropriate DOD forms when they 
are provided by and are acceptable to or preferred by the Military 
Department supplying activity or as otherwise mutually agreed upon by 
the parties.
    (b) The contracting officer shall include a provision in the order 
in accordance with 1817.504(b)(4).
    (c) To obtain materials from the Air Force Missile Procurement Fund, 
the contracting officer shall follow the procedures of 1808.002-72.


<R05>
1817.7002-1  Acceptance by Military Department.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the 
Military Department concerned will, within 30 days after receipt of a 
NASA-Defense Purchase Request, forward to the initiator of the request 
an Acceptance of MIPR, DD Form 448-2. Each DD Form 448-2 will show the 
action being taken to fill the requirement and the name and complete 
address of the DOD contracting activity.
    (b) To the extent feasible, all documents (including acceptances, 
contracts, correspondence, shipping documents, work or project orders, 
and Standard Form 1080 (Voucher for

[[Page 241]]

Transfer between Appropriations and/or Funds) billings) will reference 
the NASA-Defense Purchase Request number and the item number.
    (c) Acceptance by the Military Department is not required for NASA-
Defense Purchase Requests covering deliveries of common-use standard-
stock items that the supplying agency has on hand or on order for prompt 
delivery at published prices.


<R05>
1817.7002-2  Changes in estimated total prices.

    When a Military Department determines that the estimated total price 
(Block 7, NASA Form 523) of the items to be acquired for NASA is not 
sufficient to cover the required reimbursement or is in excess of the 
amount required, a request for an amendment will be forwarded to the 
NASA originating office. The request will indicate a specific dollar 
amount, rather than a percentage, and will include justification for any 
upward adjustment requested. Upon approval of the request, the cognizant 
NASA contracting office shall forward to the DOD contracting activity an 
amendment to the NASA Defense Purchase Request.


<R05>
1817.7002-3  Payments.

    Except when agreements provide that reimbursement is not required, 
payments to the Military Departments shall be made by that NASA office 
designated in block 9 of the NASA-Defense Purchase Request upon receipt 
of Standard Form 1080. Billings will be supported in the same manner as 
billings between Military Departments.


<R05>
1817.7002-4  Contract clause.

    The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.217-70, 
Property Administration and Reporting, in any NASA-Defense Purchase 
Request when property will be involved.


<R04>
         Subpart 1817.71--Exchange or Sale of Personal Property


<R05>
1817.7101  Policy.

    (a) Section 201(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative 
Services Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 384, as amended (40 U.S.C. 481(c)), 
authorizes the exchange or sale of Government personal property and the 
application of the exchange allowance or proceeds from the sale to the 
acquisition of similar property for replacement purposes. The 
transaction must be evidenced in writing.
    (b) NASA installations and contractors are authorized to conduct 
exchange/sale transactions as long as the requirements and restrictions 
of NHB 4300.1 and the Federal Property Management Regulations, 
Subchapter H, part 101-46, are followed. In conducting such exchanges/
sales, NASA contractors must obtain the contracting officer's prior 
written approval and must report the transactions to the cognizant NASA 
installation Property Disposal Officer (PDO).

1819.001  Definitions.

    High-Tech as used in this part means research and/or development 
efforts that are within or advance the state-of-the-art in a technology 
discipline and are performed primarily by professional engineers, 
scientists, and highly skilled and trained technicians or specialists.


<R04>
                        Subpart 1819.2--Policies


<R05>
1819.201  General policy. (NASA supplements paragraphs (a), (c), and (d)

    (a)(i) NASA is committed to providing to small, small disadvantaged, 
and women-owned small business concerns, maximum practicable 
opportunities to participate in Agency acquisitions at the prime 
contract level. The participation of NASA prime contractors in providing 
subcontracting opportunities to such entities is also an essential part 
of the Agency's commitment. The participation of these entities is 
particularly emphasized in high-technology areas where they have not 
traditionally dominated.
    (ii) Congress established an 8 percent goal for NASA as described in 
1819.7000. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 has made 
NASA subject to a 5 percent goal for prime and subcontract awards to 
small disadvantaged business concerns, Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities, and minority institutions. Unlike the NASA 8 percent goal, 
the 5 percent goal does not include prime and subcontract awards to 
women-owned small businesses. NASA also annually negotiates small, small 
disadvantaged, and women-owned small business prime and subcontracting 
goals with the Small Business Administration pursuant to section 15(g) 
of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644). These goals are Agencywide 
goals.
    (c) The Associate Administrator for Small and Disadvantaged Business 
Utilization (Code K) is the Agency official responsible for carrying out 
the duties in FAR 19.201(c).
    (d)(i) The center director shall designate a qualified individual in 
the contracting office as a small business specialist to provide a 
central point of contact to which small business concerns may direct 
inquiries concerning small business matters and participation in NASA 
acquisitions. The small business specialist shall also perform other 
functions specifically set forth in this section 1819.201 or that the 
procurement officer may prescribe, with the concurrence of the Associate 
Administrator for Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, for 
implementing the Small Business Program. When the center director 
considers that the volume of acquisitions or the functions relating to 
acquisitions at the center do not warrant a full-time small business 
specialist, these duties may be assigned to procurement personnel on a 
part-time basis.
    (ii) Small business specialists appointed under paragraph (d)(i) of 
this subsection shall perform the following duties, as the procurement 
officer determines appropriate to the installation:
    (A) Maintain a program designed to locate capable small business 
sources, including those located in labor surplus areas, for current and 
future acquisitions.
    (B) Coordinate inquiries and requests for advice from small business 
concerns on acquisition matters.
    (C) Before issuance of solicitations or contract modifications for 
additional supplies or services, determine that small business concerns 
will receive adequate consideration, including making recommendations 
for initiation of set-asides (see FAR 19.5 and 19.8) and for taking 
action in accordance with FAR 19.506(b) and 1819.502-70. Participate and 
provide input early in the acquisition planning phase of proposed 
acquisitions, including acquisition strategy meetings.
    (D) If small business concerns cannot be given an opportunity to 
compete because adequate specifications or drawings are not available, 
work with appropriate technical and contracting personnel to ensure that 
necessary specifications or drawings for current or future acquisitions 
will be available.
    (E) Review acquisitions for possible breakout of items suitable for 
acquisition from small business concerns.
    (F) Advise small business concerns regarding financial assistance 
available under laws and regulations, assist

[[Page 244]]

such concerns in applying for such assistance, and ensure that small 
business concerns' requests for financial assistance are not treated as 
a handicap in securing the award of contracts.
    (G) Participate in responsibility determinations (see FAR 9.103) 
when small business concerns are involved.
    (H) Participate in the evaluation of prime contractors' small 
business subcontracting programs (see FAR 19.705-4).
    (I) Review and make appropriate recommendations to the contracting 
officer on any proposal to furnish Government-owned facilities to a 
contractor if such action may hurt the Small Business Program.
    (J) Ensure that participation of small business concerns is 
accurately reported.
    (K) Make available to SBA copies of solicitations when requested.
    (L) Act as liaison between contracting officers and SBA area offices 
and representatives in connection with set-asides, certificates of 
competency, and any other matters in which the Small Business Program 
may be involved.
    (M) In cooperation with contracting officers and technical 
personnel, seek and develop information on the technical competence of 
small business concerns for research and development contracts. 
Regularly bring to the attention of contracting officers and technical 
personnel descriptive data, brochures, and other information regarding 
small business concerns that are apparently competent to perform 
research and development work in fields in which NASA is interested.
    (N) When a small business concern's offer has been rejected for 
nonresponsiveness or nonresponsibility, assist that concern, upon its 
request, in understanding such requirements for future awards.
    (O) Advise center personnel, as necessary, on new Governmentwide and 
Agency-approved small business programs and initiatives.

    Prior to effecting a contract consolidation valued at $5 million or 
more, including options, which will not be exclusively reserved for 
small or 8(a) firms, the contracting officer, with assistance from the 
small business specialist and the cognizant technical office, shall 
prepare an impact assessment of the effects of the consolidation on 
present and future contracting and subcontracting opportunities for 
small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business. The impact 
assessment shall address the reasons for the proposed consolidation 
(especially where apparently unrelated efforts are being combined), the 
expected benefits, and any actions planned to mitigate or eliminate the 
impact on small business entities. The impact assessment shall be 
forwarded to the Associate Administrator for Procurement (Code HS) for 
concurrence by cognizant Headquarters offices and approval by the 
Associate Deputy Administrator (Technical).

    (a) All cases involving the non-initiation of a set-aside, whether 
resulting

[[Page 245]]

from a joint decision of the small business specialist and the 
contracting officer or a decision by the contracting officer alone, 
require referral to the SBA representative (if one is assigned and 
available) for review.
    (b) If the small business specialist recommends that an individual 
acquisition or a class of acquisition, or a portion thereof, be set 
aside, the contracting officer shall promptly either concur in or 
disapprove the recommendation, stating in writing the reasons for 
disapproval.
    (c) When an SBA representative is assigned and available and the 
contracting officer disapproves the small business specialist's 
recommendation, the contracting officer shall promptly refer the case to 
the SBA representative for review. The small business specialist shall 
take no further appeal action. The SBA representative must either concur 
with the decision or appeal the case to the procurement officer under 
FAR 19.505. If the procurement officer approves the contracting 
officer's decision and the SBA appeals under FAR 19.505(c), the 
procurement officer shall forward the required written justification, 
including a history of discussions between the center and the SBA and 
rationale for the decision, to the Headquarters Office of Procurement 
(HS).
    (d) When an SBA representative is not assigned or available and the 
contracting officer disapproves the small business specialist's 
recommendation, the small business specialist may appeal in writing to 
the procurement officer. The procurement officer's decision shall be 
final. The contracting officer shall place a memorandum of the 
procurement officer's decision in the contract file. If the procurement 
officer's decision approves the contracting officer's action, the small 
business specialist shall forward complete documentation of the case to 
the Headquarters Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization 
(Code K).
    (e) The contracting officer shall prepare, sign, and retain in the 
contract file a memorandum of nonconcurrence in a recommended set-aside 
action.

    (b) If an SBA representative is not assigned or available, and the 
small business specialist disagrees with the contracting officer's 
written decision of withdrawal or modification of a set-aside 
determination, the small business specialist may appeal to the 
procurement officer in accordance with the procedures in 1819.502-70(d).

    (a) On proposed awards exceeding the simplified acquisition 
threshold, the contracting officer should consider requesting a preaward 
survey (see FAR 9.106) before determining that a responsive small 
business firm is not responsible. The scope of the preaward survey 
request should be limited to those elements of responsibility that are 
questioned.
    (2) The contracting officer shall forward a copy of the referral to 
SBA through the procurement officer to the Headquarters Office of Small 
and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (Code K).

    (a) When agreement cannot be reached between the contracting officer 
and the SBA Area Office, the contracting officer shall forward to the 
Headquarters Office of Procurement (Code HS) on an expedited basis, a 
complete case file with a request that the case be considered for appeal 
to SBA Headquarters. The contracting officer shall include the data 
already furnished to SBA, SBA's rationale for proposing to issue a COC, 
and the contracting officer's comments. The contracting officer shall 
suspend acquisition action until informed by Code HS of the final 
decision in the case.
    (b) If the Office of Procurement concludes that the referral to SBA 
should be withdrawn and a contract awarded without benefit of a COC, 
Code HS shall inform the contracting officer.
    (c) If the Office of Procurement agrees with the contracting 
officer's recommended appeal action, the Associate Administrator for 
Procurement shall forward the appeal through the Office of Small and 
Disadvantaged Business Utilization (Code K) to SBA Headquarters.

            Business and Women-Owned Small Business Concerns


<R05>
1819.705-2  Determining the need for a subcontracting plan. (NASA supplements paragraph (d))

    (d) Solicitations for competitive negotiated acquisitions shall 
require proposed subcontracting plans with initial proposals (see 
1819.708(b)(1)). For sole source negotiated acquisitions, the contractor 
shall be required to submit a proposed subcontracting plan with the 
proposal.


<R05>
1819.705-4  Reviewing the subcontracting plan.


<R05>
1819.705-470  Acquisition-specific subcontracting goals.

    Section 1819.201 addresses Agencywide goals at the combined prime 
and subcontract levels. Appropriate subcontracting goals for an 
individual acquisition, however, are to be independently determined on 
the basis of the specific circumstances of the acquisition, consistent 
with FAR 19.705-4 and 1819.7002(b), and not on the basis of an 
Agencywide or center goal. Acquisition-specific subcontracting goals 
should reflect maximum practicable opportunities for all categories of 
small business concerns to participate in NASA programs, consistent with 
efficient performance. The methods outlined in NASA Policy Directive 
(NPD) 5000.2, Uniform Methodology for Determination of Small 
Disadvantaged Subcontracting Goals, may also be useful in establishing 
reasonable subcontracting goals for small and women-owned small business 
concerns.


<R05>
1819.708  Solicitation provisions and contract clauses. (NASA supplements paragraph (b))

    (b)(1) The contracting officer shall use the clause at FAR 52.219-9 
with its Alternate II when contracting by negotiation.


<R05>
1819.708-70  NASA solicitation provision and contract clause.

    (a) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 1852.219-
73, Small, Small Disadvantaged, and Women-Owned Small Business 
Subcontracting Plan, in invitations for bids containing the clause at 
FAR 52.219-9 with its Alternate I. Insert in the last sentence the 
number of calendar days after request that the offeror must submit a 
complete plan.
    (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.219-75, 
Small, Small Disadvantaged, and Women-Owned Small Business 
Subcontracting Reporting, in solicitations and contracts containing the 
clause at FAR

<R04>
                  Subpart 1819.70--NASA 8 Percent Goal


<R05>
1819.7000  General.

    Public Laws 101-144, 101-507, and 102-389 require the NASA 
Administrator to ensure, to the fullest extent possible, that at least 
8% of Federal funding for prime and subcontracts awarded in support of 
authorized programs, including the space station by the time operational 
status is obtained, be made available to small disadvantaged business 
concerns, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, minority 
institutions, and women-owned small business concerns.


<R05>
1819.7001  Definitions.

    (a) Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) concern and Women-Owned Small 
Business (WOSB) concern are defined in FAR 19.001.
    (b) Historically Black College or University (HBCU) and Minority 
Institution (MI) are defined in FAR 26.301.


<R05>
1819.7002  Contracting officer responsibility.

    (a) Contracting officers must seek out as potential sources entities 
identified in 1819.7001 and give full consideration to these entities to 
satisfy NASA requirements. The participation of NASA prime contractors 
is also essential to meeting the Agency's 8 percent goal.
    (b) NASA Policy Directive (NPD) 5000.2, Uniform Methodology for 
Determination of Small Disadvantaged Subcontracting Goals, contains 
guidance on developing realistic goals. It is applicable to acquisitions 
expected to exceed $50 million, including options. The methodology may 
be used for lesser value acquisitions.


<R05>
1819.7003  Contract clause.

    The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.219-76, NASA 
8 Percent Goal, in all solicitations and contracts other than those 
below the simplified acquisition threshold or when the contract, 
together with all its subcontracts, is to be performed entirely outside 
of any State, territory, or possession of the United States, the 
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the Trust 
Territory of the Pacific Islands.


<R04>
          Subpart 1819.71--NASA Rural Area Small Business Plan


<R05>
1819.7101  Definition.

    Rural area means a county with a population of fewer than twenty 
thousand individuals.

[[Page 248]]


<R05>
1819.7102  General.

    Pursuant to Public Law 100-590, NASA established a Rural Area 
Business Enterprise Development Plan, including methods for encouraging 
prime and subcontractors to use small business concerns located in rural 
areas as subcontractors and suppliers. One method is to encourage the 
contractor to use its best efforts to comply with the intent of the 
statute.


<R05>
1819.7103  Solicitation provision and contract clause.

    The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.219-74, Use 
of Rural Area Small Businesses, in solicitations and contracts that 
offer subcontracting possibilities or that are expected to exceed 
$500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction of public facility) unless the 
contract, together with all its subcontracts, is to be performed 
entirely outside of any State, territory, or possession of the United 
States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and 
the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.


<R04>
              Subpart 1819.72--NASA Mentor-Protege Program


<R05>
1819.7201  Scope of subpart.

    The NASA Mentor-Protege Program is designed to incentivize NASA 
prime contractors to assist small disadvantaged business concerns, 
Historically Black colleges and Universities, minority institutions, and 
women-owned small business concerns, in enhancing their capabilities to 
perform NASA contracts and subcontracts, foster the establishment of 
long-term business relationships between these entities and NASA prime 
contractors, and increase the overall number of these entities that 
receive NASA contract and subcontract awards.


<R05>
1819.7202  Definitions.

    High-Tech is defined in 1819.001.


<R05>
1819.7203.  Non-affiliation.

    For purposes of the Small Business Act, a protege firm may not be 
considered an affiliate of a mentor firm solely on the basis that the 
protege firm is receiving developmental assistance referred to in 
1819.7214 from such mentor firm under the Program. In addition, NASA 
shall not consider partial ownership, up to 10 percent, of a Department 
of Defense (DOD)-sanctioned protege firm by its DOD mentor to constitute 
affiliation.


<R05>
1819.7204  Transportability of features from the Department of Defense (DOD) Mentor-Protege program to NASA contractors.

    (a) In accordance with the benefits authorized by the DOD Mentor-
Protege Program (Public Law 101-510, Section 831, as amended by Public 
Law 102-190, Section 814), a NASA contractor who is also an approved DOD 
mentor can transfer credit features to their NASA contracts.
    (b) NASA prime contractors, who are approved DOD mentors, can award 
subcontracts noncompetitively under their NASA contracts to the proteges 
which they are assisting under the DOD Program (Public Law 101-510, 
Section 831(f)(2)).
    (c) NASA prime contractors may count the costs of developmental 
assistance provided of proteges being assisted under the DOD Program 
toward meeting the goals in their subcontracting plans under their NASA 
prime contracts (Public Law 102-190, Section 814). Limitations which may 
reduce the value of this benefit include:
    (1) Credit toward attaining subcontracting goals is available only 
to the extent that the developmental assistance costs have not been 
reimbursed to the contractor by DOD as direct or indirect costs; or
    (2) The credit is available to meet the goals of a NASA 
subcontracting plan only to the extent that it has not been applied to a 
DOD subcontracting plan. The same unreimbursed developmental assistance 
costs cannot be counted toward meeting the subcontracting goals of more 
than one prime contract. These costs would accrue from credit for the 
multiples attributed to assistance provided by Small Business 
Development Centers, Historically Black Colleges and Universities and 
minority institutions.
    (d) The features identified in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this 
section point out the portability of features

[[Page 249]]

from the DOD Mentor-Protege Program to NASA prime contractors. NASA 
mentors will be held to show ``good faith'' by providing actual 
developmental assistance beyond transferring credit from activity in the 
DOD Program to NASA subcontracting plans.


<R05>
1819.7205  General policy.

    (a) Eligible large business prime contractors, not included on the 
``List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement 
Programs'', who have at least one active subcontracting plan, and who 
are approved as mentor firms may enter into agreements with eligible 
entities (as defined in 1819.7209) as proteges to provide appropriate 
developmental assistance to enhance the capabilities of proteges to 
perform as subcontractors and suppliers. Eligible small business prime 
contractors, not included on the ``List of Parties Excluded from Federal 
Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs'', and that are capable of 
providing developmental assistance to proteges, may also be approved as 
mentors. An active mentor-protege arrangement requires the protege to be 
a subcontractor under the mentor's prime contract with NASA.
    (b) The pilot Program has a duration of three years commencing from 
March 24, 1995. During this period, eligible mentor firms, which have 
received approval by NASA to participate in the Program pursuant to 
1819.7212, may enter into agreements with protege firms.
    (c) For the pilot phase of the Program, mentor-protege activity will 
be limited to cost-plus-award-fee contracts.
    (d) Costs incurred by a mentor to provide developmental assistance, 
technical or managerial assistance described in 1819.7214, are allowable


<R05>
1819.7206  Incentives for prime contractor participation.

    (a) During source selection Mentor-Protege will be evaluated as part 
of SDB utilization under the Mission Suitability factor. Under Mission 
Suitability, SDB utilization will be either a subfactor or an element 
under a subfactor.
    (b) Under cost-plus-award fee contracts, approved mentor firms shall 
be eligible to earn award fee associated with their performance as a 
mentor by performance evaluation period. For purposes of earning award 
fee, the mentor firm's performance shall be evaluated against the 
criteria described in the clause at 1852.219-79, Mentor Requirements and 
Evaluation.


<R05>
1819.7207  Measurement of Program success.

    The overall success of the NASA Mentor-Protege Program encompassing 
all participating mentors and proteges will be measured by the extent to 
which it results in:
    (a) An increase in the number, dollar value and percentage of 
subcontractors awarded to proteges by mentor firms under NASA contracts 
since the date of entry into the Program;
    (b) An increase in the number and dollar value of contract and 
subcontract awards to protege firms since the time of their entry into 
the Program (under NASA contracts, contracts awarded by other Federal 
agencies and under commercial contracts);
    (c) An increase in the number and dollar value of subcontracts 
awarded to a protege firm by its mentor firm; and
    (d) An increase in subcontracting with protege firms in industry 
categories where they have not traditionally participating within the 
mentor firm's activity.


<R05>
1819.7208  Mentor firms.

    (a) Eligibility:
    (1) Contractors eligible for receipt of government contracts;
    (2) Large prime contractors performing under contracts with at least 
one negotiated subcontracting plan as required by FAR 19.7; and
    (3) Small business prime contractors that can provide developmental 
assistance to enhance the capabilities of proteges to perform as 
subcontractors and suppliers.
    (b) Mentors will be encouraged to identify and select as proteges:
    (1) A broad base of firms including those defined as emerging firms 
(e.g., a protege whose size is no greater than 50 percent of the size 
standard applicable

[[Page 250]]

to the SIC code assigned to a contracting opportunity);
    (2) Firms in addition to those with whom they have established 
business relationships; and
    (3) High-tech firms.


<R05>
1819.7209  Protege firms.

    (a) For selection as a protege, a firm must be:
    (1) An SDB, HBCU, MI, or WOSB;
    (2) Certified as small in the SIC code for the services or suppliers 
to be provided by the protege under its subcontract to the mentor; and
    (3) Eligible for receipt of government contracts.
    (b) A protege firm may self-certify to a mentor firm that it meets 
the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. Mentors may 
rely in good faith on written representation by potential proteges that 
they meet the specified eligibility requirements.
    (c) Proteges may have multiple mentors. Proteges participating in 
mentor-protege programs in addition to the NASA Program should maintain 
a system for preparing separate reports of mentoring activity for each 
agency's program.


<R05>
1819.7210  Selection of protege firms.

    (a) Mentor firms will be solely responsible for selecting protege 
firms. The mentor is encouraged to identify and select the types of 
protege firms listed in 1819.7208(b).
    (b) Mentor firms may have more than one protege.
    (c) The selection of protege firms by mentor firms may not be 
protested, except as in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) A protest regarding the size of eligibility status of an entity 
selected by a mentor to be a protege shall be handled in accordance with 
FAR 19.703(b). The contracting officer shall notify the Headquarters 
Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) (Code K) 
of the protest.


<R05>
1819.7211  Application process for mentor firms to participate in the Program.

    (a) Prime contractors interested in becoming a mentor firm must 
submit a request to the NASA OSDBU to be approved under the Program. The

    (e) If OSDBU disapproves the application, then the mentor may 
provide additional information for reconsideration. The review of any 
supplemental material will be completed within 30 days after receipt by 
the OSDBU. Upon finding deficiencies that NASA considers correctable, 
the OSDBU will notify the mentor and request information to be provided 
within 30 days that may correct the deficiencies.


<R05>
1819.7213  Agreement contents.

    The contents of the agreement must contain:
    (a) Names and addresses of mentor and protege firms and a point of 
contact within both firms who will oversee the agreement;
    (b) Procedures for the mentor firm to notify the protege firm, 
OSDBU, and the contracting officer, in writing, at least 30 days in 
advance of the mentor firm's intent to voluntarily withdraw from the 
Program;
    (c) Procedures for a protege firm to notify the mentor firm in 
writing at least 30 days in advance of the protege firm's intent to 
voluntarily terminate the mentor-protege agreement. The mentor shall 
notify the OSDBU and the contracting officer immediately upon receipt of 
such notice from the protege;
    (d) A description of the type of developmental program that will be 
provided by the mentor firm to the protege firm, to include a 
description of the subcontract work, and a schedule for providing 
assistance and criteria for evaluation of the protege developmental 
success;
    (e) A listing of the number and types of subcontracts to be awarded 
to the protege firm;
    (f) Program participation term;
    (g) Termination procedures;

    (i) Other terms and conditions, as appropriate.


<R05>
1819.7214  Developmental assistance.

    The forms of developmental assistance a mentor can provide to a 
protege include:
    (a) Management guidance relating to--
    (1) Financial management,
    (2) Organizational management,
    (3) Overall business management/planning, and
    (4) Business development;
    (b) Engineering and other technical assistance;
    (c) Noncompetitive award of subcontracts under NASA contracts;
    (d) Progress payments based on costs. The customary progress payment 
rate for all NASA contracts with small disadvantaged businesses is 95 
percent. This customary progress payment rate for small disadvantaged 
businesses may be used by prime contractors;
    (e) Advance payments. While a mentor can make advance payments to 
its proteges who are performing as subcontractors, the mentor will only 
be reimbursed by NASA for these costs if

[[Page 252]]

advance payments have been authorized in accordance with statute and 
regulation;
    (f) Loans;
    (g) Rent-free use of facilities and/or equipment;
    (h) Property; and
    (i) Temporary assignment of personnel to the protege for purpose of 
training.


<R05>
1819.7215  Obligation.

    (a) The mentor or protege may voluntarily withdraw from the Program 
as mutually agreed by both mentor and protege.
    (b) Mentor and protege firms will submit a ``lessons learned'' 
evaluation to the NASA OSDBU at the conclusion of the pilot program 
period or the conclusion of their effort, whichever comes first.


<R05>
1819.7216  Internal controls.

    (a) The NASA OSDBU will manage the Program. Internal controls will 
be established by the OSDBU to achieve the stated program objectives (by 
serving as checks and balances against undesired actions or 
consequences) such as:
    (1) Reviewing and evaluating mentor applications for realism, 
validity and accuracy of provided information;
    (2) Reviewing semi-annual progress reports submitted by mentors and 
proteges, if any, on protege development to measure protege progress 
against the master plan contained in the approved agreement.
    (3) Site visits to NASA installation where mentor-protege activity 
is on-going.
    (b) NASA may terminate mentor-protege agreements if NASA determines 
that such actions are in NASA's interest. These actions shall be 
approved by the NASA OSDBU. NASA will terminate an agreement or exclude 
a particular entity by sending a written notice to the affected party 
specifying the action being taken and the effective date of that action. 
Termination of an agreement does not constitute a termination of the 
subcontract between the mentor and the protege. A plan for accomplishing 
the subcontract effort should the agreement be terminated shall be 
submitted with the agreement, as required in 1819.7213(h).


<R05>
1819.7217  Reports.

    (a) Semi-annual reports shall be submitted by the mentor to the NASA 
Mentor-Protege program manager, the NASA OSDBU, to include information 
as outlined in 1852.219-79(b).
    (b) Proteges are encouraged to submit semi-annual reports to the 
OSDBU on Program progress pertaining to their mentor-protege agreement. 
However, costs associated with the preparation of these reports are 
unallowable costs under Government contracts and will not be reimbursed 
by the Government.
    (c) The NASA technical program manager shall include an assessment 
of the prime contractor's (mentor's) performance in the Mentor-Protege 
Program in his quarterly `Strengths and Weaknesses' evaluation report. A 
copy of these comments, as pertains to the technical effort and protege 
development, will be provided to the OSDBU and the contracting officer.
    (d) The NASA Mentor-Protege program manager will submit semi-annual 
reports to the cognizant contracting officer regarding the participating 
prime contractor's performance in the Program for use in the award fee 
determination process.


<R05>
1819.7218  Program review.

    At the conclusion of each year in the Mentor-Protege Program, the 
prime contractor and protege, as appropriate, will formally brief the 
NASA OSDBU, the technical program manager, and the contracting officer 
regarding Program accomplishments pertaining to the approved agreement. 
This review will be incorporated into the normal program review, where 
applicable. A separate review will be scheduled for other contracts to 
be held at the NASA work site location.


<R05>
1819.7219  Solicitation provision and contract clauses.

    (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.219-77, 
NASA Mentor-Protege Program, in all cost-plus-award-fee solicitations 
and contracts with subcontracting plans or in the case of small business

[[Page 253]]

exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) that offer 
subcontracting opportunities.
    (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.219-79, 
Mentor Requirements and Evaluation, in contracts where the prime 
contractor is a participant in the NASA Mentor-Protege Program.

1823.570-1   Scope.

    Sections 1823.570 through 1823.570-4 set forth NASA requirements for 
mandatory drug and alcohol testing of certain contractor personnel under 
section 203, National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as amended, 42 
U.S.C. 2473, 72 Stat. 429; and Civil Space Employee Testing Act of 1991,

<R05>
1823.570-2   Definitions.

    As used in this subpart employee and controlled substance are as 
defined in FAR 23.503. The use of a controlled substance in accordance 
with the terms of a valid prescription, or other uses authorized by law 
shall not be subject to the requirements of 1823.570 through 1823.570-4 
and the clause at 1852.223-74.
    Employee in a sensitive position means a contractor or subcontractor 
employee who has been granted access to classified information; a 
contractor or subcontractor employee in other positions that the 
contractor or subcontractor determines could reasonably be expected to 
affect safety, security, National security, or functions other than the 
foregoing requiring a high degree of trust and confidence; and includes 
any employee performing in a position designated ``mission critical'' 
pursuant to the clause at 1852.246-70. The term also includes any 
applicant who is interviewed for a position described in this paragraph.
    Use, in violation of applicable law or Federal regulation, of 
alcohol includes having, while on duty or during a preemployment 
interview, an alcohol concentration of 0.04 percent by weight or more in 
the blood, as measured by chemical test of the individual's breath or 
blood. An individual's refusal to submit to such test is presumptive 
evidence of use, in violation of applicable law or Federal regulation, 
of alcohol.

containing the clause at 1852.246-70, ``Mission Critical Space Systems 
Personnel Reliability Program,'' and in other solicitations and 
contracts exceeding $5 million in which work is performed by an employee 
in a sensitive position. However, the contracting officer shall not 
insert the clause at 1852.223-74 in solicitations and contracts for 
commercial items (see FAR parts 2 and 12).


<R05>
1823.570-4   Suspension of payments, termination of contract, and debarment and suspension actions.

23.506 regarding the suspension of contract payments, the termination of 
the contract for default, and debarment and suspension of a contractor 
relative to failure to comply with the clause at 1852.223-74. Causes for 
suspension of contract payments, termination of the contract for 
default, and debarment and suspension of the contractor are the 
following:
    (a) The contractor fails to comply with paragraph (b), (c), or (d) 
of the clause at 1852.223-74; or
    (b) Such a number of contractor employees in sensitive positions 
having been convicted of violations of criminal drug statutes or 
substantial evidence of drug or alcohol abuse or misuse occurring in the 
workplace, as to indicate that the contractor has failed to make a good 
faith effort to provide a drug- and alcohol-free workforce.

excluded
    (1) From any contract subject to the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts 
Act (see FAR subpart 22.6) or the Service Contract Act of 1965 (see FAR 
subpart 22.10) in which the application of the act and its implementing 
regulations constitute adequate safety and health protection;
    (2) When the contracting officer makes a written determination that 
the clause is not necessary under the circumstances of the acquisition, 
and;
    (3) Exclusion of the clause is approved by the installation safety 
and health official.
    (c) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 1852.223-
73, Safety and Health Plan, in solicitations containing the clause at 
1852.223-70, when a Safety and Health Plan is to be submitted with the 
offeror's proposal. This clause may be modified to identify specific 
information that is to be included in the plan. The contracting officer 
shall include the approved plan in any resulting contract.
    (d) When the installation safety and health official recommends that

<R05>
1825.101-70  NASA definition.

    Canadian end product, or an item with an estimated value of $25,000 
or less, means an unmanufactured end product mined or produced in Canada 
or an end product manufactured in Canada, if the cost of its components 
mined, produced, or manufactured in Canada or the United States exceeds 
50 percent of the cost of all its components. The cost of components 
includes transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the end 
product. For an end product with an estimated value in excess of 
$25,000, the definition at FAR 25.401 applies.


<R05>
1825.102 Policy.  (NASA supplements paragraphs (a) and (b))

    (a)(3)(A) The procurement officer shall send proposed public 
interest determinations to the Associate Administrator for Procurement 
(Code HS) for approval.
    (B) See 1825.103-70(A) for a blanket determination regarding 
Canadian end products.
    (a)(4) The items listed in FAR 25.108(d)(1) are not mined, produced, 
or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably 
available commercial quantities or a satisfactory quality.
    (b)(1) Contracting officers may make determinations of 
nonavailability both before entering into contracts and in the course of 
contract administration; provided, however, that in the latter case the 
Government receives adequate consideration. The following is the format 
for nonavailability determinations:

                    Determination of Nonavailability

    Pursuant to the authority contained in the Buy American Act (41 
U.S.C. 10) and authority delegated to me by NFS 1825.102(b)(1), I hereby 
make the following findings:
    a. (Insert a description of the item or items to be acquired, 
including unit, quantity, and estimated cost inclusive of duty and 
transportation costs to destination.)
    b. (Enter the name and address of the proposed contractor or 
supplier and the country of origin of the items.)
    c. (Include a brief statement of the necessity for the acquisition.)
    d. (Include a statement of facts establishing the nonavailability of 
similar items of domestic origin. If there is no known domestic item 
that can be used as a reasonable substitute, make a statement to this 
effect.)
    On the basis of these findings, I determine that the item(s) 
described in paragraph a. above is/are not mined, produced, or 
manufactured (or the articles, materials, or supplies from which the 
item(s) is/are manufactured are not mined, produced, or manufactured) in 
the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities of a 
satisfactory quality.
    Accordingly, the Buy American Act requirement that acquisition be 
made from domestic sources and that the item(s) be of domestic origin is 
not applicable to this acquisition, since the acquisition is within the 
Buy American Act's nonavailability exception.
    Authority is granted to acquire the above-described item(s) of 
foreign origin (country

[[Page 261]]

or origin) at an estimated total cost of $________, including duty and 
transportation costs to destination.

<R05>
1825.103-70  Canadian end products.

    (a) The Associate Administrator for Procurement has determined that 
it is inconsistent with the public interest to apply restrictions of the 
Buy American Act to Canadian end products with estimated values of 
$25,000 or less as defined in 1825.101-70. Accordingly, contracting 
officers shall evaluate all offers for such Canadian end products on a 
parity with offers for domestic and products, except that applicable 
duty (whether or not a duty free entry certificate may be issued) shall 
be included in evaluating offers for Canadian end products.
    (b) See FAR 25.402(a)(3)(ii) for evaluation of Canadian end products 
with values in excess of 25,000 as defined in FAR 25.401.

    (a) To make the price comparison between domestic and foreign 
offers, the contracting officer shall increase the price of the foreign 
offer by 6- or 12-percent, as applicable. If the application of the 
differential results in a tie between the foreign and domestic offers, 
award shall be made to the domestic offeror.
    (c) The FAR requirement to apply both 6- and 12-percent factors 
pertains only when the lowest acceptable domestic offer is from a small 
business concern.


<R05>

activity when required, contracting officers may make determinations of 
nonavailability both before entering into contracts and in the course of 
contract administration; provided, however, that in the latter case the 
Government receives adequate consideration. See 1825.102(b)(1) for the

<R05>
1827.302  Policy. (NASA supplements paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), and (i)).

    (a) Introduction.
    (i) NASA policy with respect to any invention, discovery, 
improvement, or innovation made in the performance of

[[Page 266]]

work under any NASA contract or subcontract with other than a small 
business firm or a nonprofit organization and the allocation to related 
property rights is based upon Section 305 of the National Aeronautics 
and Space Act of 1958, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2457) (the Act); and, to 
the extent consistent with this statute, the Presidential Memorandum or 
Government Patent Policy to the Heads of Executive Departments and 
Agencies, dated February 18, 1983, and Section 1(d)(4) of Executive 
Order 12591. NASA policy with respect to any invention made in the 
performance of experimental, developmental, or research work with a 
small business firm or a nonprofit organization is based on 35 U.S.C. 
Chapter 18, as amended.
    (ii) NASA contracts subject to Section 305 of the Act shall ensure 
the prompt reporting of reportable items in other to protect the 
Government's interest and to provide widest practicable and appropriate 
dissemination, early utilization, expeditious development, and continued 
availability for the benefit of the scientific, industrial, and 
commercial communities and the general public.
    (b) Contractor right to elect title.
    (i) For NASA contracts, the contractor right to elect title only 
applies to contracts with small businesses and non-profit organizations. 
For other business entities, see subdivision (ii) of this paragraph.
    (ii) Contractor right to request a waiver of title. For NASA 
contracts with other than a small business firm or a nonprofit 
organization (contracts subject to Section 305 of the Act), it is the 
policy of NASA to waive the rights (to acquire title) of the United 
States (with the reservation of a Government license set forth in FAR 
27.302(c) and the march-in rights of FAR 27.302(f) and 1827.302(f)) in 
and to any subject invention if the Administrator determines that the 
interests of the United States will be served. This policy, as well as 
the procedures and instructions for such waiver of rights, is stated in 
the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR Section 1245, Subpart 1. 
Waiver may be requested in advance of contract award for any or all of 
the subject inventions, or for individually identified subject 
inventions reported under the contract. When waiver of rights is 
granted, the contractor's right to title, the rights reserved by the 
Government, and other conditions and obligations of the waiver shall be 
included in an Instrument of Waiver executed by NASA and the party 
receiving the waiver.
    (iii) It is also a policy of NASA to consider for a monetary award, 
when referred to the NASA Inventions and Contributions Board, any 
subject invention reported to NASA in accordance with this subpart, and 
for which an application for patent has been filed.
    (c) Government license. For each subject invention made in the 
performance of work under a NASA contract with other than a small 
business firm or nonprofit organization and for which waiver of rights 
has been granted in accordance with 14 CFR Section 1245, Subpart 1, the 
Administrator shall reserve an irrevocable, nonexclusive, 
nontransferable, royalty-free license for the practice of such invention 
throughout the world by or on behalf of the United States or any foreign 
Government in accordance with any treaty or agreement of the United 
States.
    (d) Government right to receive title. Under any NASA contract with 
other than a small business or nonprofit organization (i.e., those 
contracts subject to Section 305(a) of the Act), title to subject 
inventions vests in NASA when the determinations of Section 305(a)(1) or 
305(a)(2) have been made. The Administrator may grant a waiver of title 
in accordance with 14 CFR Section 1245.
    (e) Utilization reports. For any NASA contract with other than a 
small business firm or a nonprofit organization, the requirements for 
utilization reports shall be as set forth in the NASA Patent Waiver 
Regulations, 14 CFR Section 1245, Subpart 1, and any Instrument of 
Waiver executed under those Regulations.
    (f) March-in rights. For any NASA contract with other than a small 
business firm or a nonprofit organization, the march-in rights shall be 
as set forth in the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR Section 1245, 
Subpart 1, and any Instrument of Waiver executed under those 
Regulations.

[[Page 267]]

    (g) Preference for United States industry. Waiver of the requirement 
for the agreement for any NASA contract with other than a small business 
firm or a nonprofit organization shall be in accordance with the NASA 
Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR Section 1245, Subpart 1.
    (i) Minimum rights to contractor.
    (1) For NASA contracts with other than a small business firm or a 
nonprofit organization (i.e., those contracts subject to Section 305(a) 
of the Act), where title to any subject inventions vests in NASA, the 
contractor is normally granted, in accordance with 14 CFR 1245, a 
revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license in each patent application 
filed in any country and in any resulting patent. The license extends to 
any of the contractor's domestic subsidiaries and affiliates within the 
corporate structure, and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the 
same scope to the extent the contractor was legally obligated to do so 
at the time the contract was awarded. The license and right are 
transferable only with the approval of the Administrator, except when 
transferred to the successor of that part of the contractor's business 
to which the invention pertains.
    (2) The Administrator is the approval authority for revoking or 
modifying a license. The procedures for revocation or modification are 
described in 37 CFR 404.10 and 14 CFR 1245.108.

    (4) Forward to the Patent Representative all correspondence relating 
to inventions and waivers under the New Technology clause or election of 
title under the Patent Rights--Retention by the Contractor (Short Form) 
clause.
    (5) Upon receipt of any final report required by the clause, and 
upon determination that the contract work is complete, determine whether 
the contractor has complied with the clause's reporting requirements. If 
so, the New Technology Representative shall certify compliance, obtain 
the Patent Representative's concurrence, and forward the certification 
to the contracting officer.
    (c) The Patent Representative shall review each reportable item to 
ascertain whether it is to be considered a subject invention, obtain any 
determinations required by paragraph (b) of the clause at 1852.227-70, 
New Technology, and notify the contractor. As to any subject invention, 
the Patent Representative shall:
    (1) Ensure that the contractor has provided sufficient information

documents in accordance with paragraph (f) of the clause and take 
corrective action as appropriate. However, no action may be taken by 
either the New Technology Representative or the Patent Representative 
that would constitute a final decision under the Disputes clause, 
involve any change or increase in the work required to be performed 
under the contact that is inconsistent with any right of appeal provided 
in FAR 27.304-5 or 14 CFR 1245, Subpart 1, or otherwise be outside the 
scope of the contract.
    (e) The contracting officer shall not approve release of final 
payment under the contract and, if applicable, any reserve set aside 
under the withholding provisions of the clause for deficiencies and 
delinquent reporting not corrected as of the time of the submission of 
the final report by the contractor until receipt of the New Technology 
Representative's certification of compliance, and the Patent 
Representative's concurrence.

<R05>
1827.404  Basic rights in data clause. (NASA supplements paragraphs (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), and (i))

    (d) Protection of limited rights data specified for delivery. The 
contracting officer shall consult with the installation patent or 
intellectual property counsel regarding any questions concerning the 
delivery of limited rights data and/or the use of Alternate II that may 
arise from an offeror's response to the provision at FAR 52.227-15, 
Representation of Limited Rights Data and Restricted Computer Software, 
or during negotiations.
    (e) Protection of restricted computer software specified for 
delivery. The contracting officer shall consult with the installation

    (f) Copyrighted data.--(1)(ii) The contracting officer shall consult 
with the installation patent or intellectual property counsel before 
granting permission for a contractor to claim copyright subsisting in 
data, other than computer software, first produced under the contract.
    (iv) The contracting officer, with the concurrence of the 
installation intellectual property counsel, is the approval authority 
for obtaining a copyright license of a different scope than set forth in 
subparagraph (c)(1) of the clause at FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data--
General, for any contract or class of contracts.
    (2)(i) The procurement officer is the approval authority for 
obtaining a copyright license of a different scope than that set forth 
in subparagraph(c)(2) of the clause at FAR 52.227-14 for any contract or 
class of contracts.
    (g) Release, publication, and use of data.
    (3)(A) NASA's intent is to ensure the most expeditious dissemination 
of computer software developed by it or its contractor. Accordingly, 
when the clause at FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data-General, is modified by 
1852.227-14 (see 1827.409(a)), the contractor may not assert claim to 
copyright, publish, or release to others computer software first 
produced in the performance of a contract without the contracting 
officer's prior written permission.
    (B) The contracting officer may, in consultation with the 
installation patent or intellectual property counsel, grant the 
contractor permission to copyright, publish, or release to others 
computer software first produced in the performance of a contract if:
    (a) The contractor has identified an existing commercial computer 
software product line or proposes a new one and states a positive 
intention of incorporating any computer software first produced under 
the contract into that line, either directly itself or through a 
licensee;
    (b) The contractor has made, or will be required to make, 
significant contributions to the development of the computer software by 
co-funding or by cost-sharing, or by contributing resources (including 
but not limited to agreement to provide continuing maintenance and 
update of the software at no cost for Governmental use); or
    (c) The concurrence of the Headquarters Office of Aeronautics 
Commercial Technology Division (Code RW) is obtained.
    (C)(a) The contractor's request for permission in accordance with 
1827.404(g)(3)(A) may be made either before contract award or during 
contract performance.
    (b) Any permission granted in accordance with 1827.404(g)(3)(B) (a) 
or (b) shall be by express contract provision (or amendment) overriding 
subparagraph (d)(3) or FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data--General, (as 
modified by 1852.227-14), rather than by deleting it. The contract 
provision may contain appropriate assurances that the computer software 
will be incorporated into an existing or proposed new commercial 
computer software product line within a reasonable time and/or that the 
agreed contributions to the Government are fulfilled, with contingencies 
enabling the Government to

obtain the right to distribute the software for commercial use, 
including the right to obtain assignment of copyright where applicable, 
in order to prevent the computer software from being suppressed or 
abandoned by the contractor.
    (c) Any permission granted in accordance with 1827.404(g)(3)(B)(c) 
may be either by deleting subparagraph (d)(3) or by special contract 
provision, as appropriate.
    (d) When any permission to copyright is granted, any copyright 
license retained by the Government shall be of the same scope as set 
forth in subparagraph (c)(1) of the clause at FAR 52.227-14 and without 
any obligation of confidentiality on the part of the Government, unless 
in accordance with 1827.404(g)(3)(B)(b) the contributions of the 
Contractor may be considered ``substantial'' for the purposes of FAR 
27.408 (i.e., approximately 50 percent), in which case rights consistent 
with FAR 27.408 may be negotiated for the computer software in question.
    (D) If the contractor has not been granted permission to copyright, 
paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of the clause at FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data--
General (as modified by 1852.227-14) enables NASA to direct the 
contractor to assert claim to copyright in computer software first 
produced under the contract and to assign, or obtain the assignment of, 
such copyright to the Government or its designee. The contracting 
officer may, in consultation with the installation intellectual property 
counsel, so direct the contractor in situations where copyright 
protection is considered necessary in furtherance of Agency mission 
objectives, needed to support specific Agency programs, or necessary to 
meet statutory requirements.
    (h) Unauthorized marking of data. The contracting officer shall 
consult with the installation patent or intellectual property counsel 
before taking any action regarding unauthorized markings of data under 
paragraph (e) of the clause at FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data--General.
    (i) Omitted or incorrect notices. The contracting officer shall 
consult with the installation patent or intellectual property counsel 
before agreeing to add or correct any markings on data under paragraph 
(f) of the clause at FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data--General.


<R05>
Sec. 1827.405  Other data rights provisions. (NASA supplements paragraphs (b) and (c))

    (b)(2) Acquisition of existing computer software. See 1827.409(k) 
(i)-(ii) and 1827.409-70 for modifications and alternatives to the 
clause at 52.227-19.
    (c) Contracts awarded under the Small Business Innovative Research 
(SBIR) Program. If, during the performance of an SBIR contract (Phase I 
or Phase II), the need arises for NASA to obtain delivery of restricted 
computer software as defined in the clause at FAR 52.227-20, Rights in 
Data--SBIR Program, and the contractor agrees to such delivery, the 
restricted computer software may be required with restricted rights by 
modification of the contract or under an agreement incorporated in and 
made part of the contract, using the restricted rights set forth in FAR 
27.404(e) and the related restrictions as a guide.


<R05>
1827.406  Acquisition of data. (NASA supplements paragraph (a))

    (a) General. Requirements for delivering technical data relating to 
standard commercial items, components, or processes should be kept to 
the absolute minimum consistent with the purpose for which they are 
being procured. Normally, a vendor's manuals for installation, 
operation, or maintenance and repair and/or form, fit, and function data 
are adequate.


<R05>
1827.406-70  Reports of work.

    (a) When considered necessary for monitoring contract performance, 
contracting officers shall require contractors to furnish reports of 
work performed under research and development contracts (fixed-price and 
cost reimbursement) or in cost-reimbursement supply contracts. This 
purpose may be achieved by including the following general requirements, 
modified as needed to meet the particular requirements of the contract, 
in the section of the contract specifying data delivery requirements:
    (1) Monthly progress reports. Reports should be in narrative form, 
brief, and

[[Page 273]]

informal. They should include a quantitative description of progress, an 
indication of any current problems that may impede performance, proposed 
corrective action, and a discussion of the work to be performed during 
the next monthly reporting period. (Normally, this requirement should 
not be used in contracts with nonprofit organizations.)
    (2) Quarterly progress reports. In addition to factual data, these 
reports should include a separate analysis section interpreting the 
results obtained, recommending further action, and relating occurrences 
to the ultimate objectives of the contract. Sufficient diagrams, 
sketches, curves, photographs, and drawings should be included to convey 
the intended meaning.
    (3) Final report. This report should summarize the results of the 
entire contract, including recommendations and conclusions based on the 
experience and results obtained. The final report should include tables, 
graphs, diagrams, curves, sketches, photographs, and drawings in 
sufficient detail to explain comprehensively the results achieved under 
the contract.
    (4) Report Documentation Page. The contractor should include a 
completed Report Documentation Page (SF 298) as the final page of each 
report submitted.
    (b) The contracting officer shall consider the desirability of 
providing reports on the completion of significant units or phases of 
work, in addition to periodic reports and reports on the completion of 
the contract.
    (c) A reproducible copy and a printed, or reproduced, copy of the 
reports shall be sent to the NASA Center for AeroSpace Information 
(CASI), Attn: Accessioning Department, 800 Elkridge Landing Road, 
Linthicum Heights, MD 21090-2934 (see 1835.070(a)).


<R05>
1827.408  Cosponsored research and development activities.

    The contracting officer shall consult with the installation patent 
or intellectual property counsel before limiting the acquisition of or 
acquiring less than unlimited rights to any data developed under 
contracts involving cosponsored research and development activities.


<R05>
1827.409  Solicitation provisions and contract clauses. (NASA supplements paragraph (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (i), and (k))

    (a) The contracting officer shall add subparagraph (3) set forth in 
1852.277-14 to paragraph (d) of the clause at FAR 52.227-14, Rights in 
Data--General, except in solicitations and contracts for basic or 
applied research with universities or colleges.
    (b) The contracting officer, with the concurrence of the 
installation intellectual property counsel, is the approval authority 
for use of Alternate I. An example of its use is where the principal 
purpose of the contract (such as a contract for basic or applied 
research) does not involve the development, use, or delivery of items, 
components, or processes that are intended to be acquired for use by or 
for the Government (either under the contract in question or under any 
anticipated follow-on contracts relating to the same subject matter).
    (c) The contracting officer shall normally add the disclosure 
purposes listed in FAR 27.404(d)(1) (i)-(v) to subparagraph (g)(2). 
However, the contracting officer may, upon consultation with the 
installation patent or intellectual property counsel, make deletions 
from the specific purposes listed. If all are deleted, the word ``None'' 
must be inserted. Additions to those specific purposes listed may be 
made only with the approval of the procurement officer and concurrence 
of the installation patent or intellectual property counsel.
    (d) The contracting officer shall consult with the installation 
patent or intellectual property counsel regarding the acquisition of 
restricted computer software with greater or lesser rights than those 
set forth in Alternate III. Where it is impractical to actually modify 
the notice of Alternate III, this may be done by express reference in a 
separate clause in the contract or by a collateral agreement that 
addresses the change in the restricted rights.
    (e) The contracting officer, with the concurrence of the 
installation intellectual property counsel, is the approval authority 
for the use of Alternate IV in any contract other than a contract for 
basic or applied research to be performed solely by a college or

[[Page 274]]

university on campus (but not for the management or operation of 
Government facilities).
    (i) The contract officer shall modify the clause at FAR 52.227-17, 
Rights in Data--Special Works by adding paragraph (f) as set forth in 
1852.227-17.
    (k)(i) The contracting officer shall add paragraph (e) as set forth 
in 1852.227-19(a) to the clause at FAR 52.227-19, Commercial Computer 
Software--Restricted Rights, when it is contemplated that updates, 
correction notices, consultation information, and other similar items of 
information relating to commercial computer software delivered under a 
purchase order or contract are available and their receipt can be 
facilitated by signing a vendor supplied agreement, registration forms, 
or cards and returning them directly to the vendor.
    (ii) The contracting officer shall add paragraph (f) as set forth at 
1852.227-19(b) to the clause at FAR 52.227-19, Commercial Computer 
Software--Restricted Rights, when portions of a contractor's standard 
commercial license or lease agreement consistent with the clause, 
Federal laws, standard industry practices, and the FAR are to be 
incorporated into the purchase order or contract.
    (iii) See 1827.409-70.


<R05>
1827.409-70  NASA contract clause.

    The contracting officer shall use the clause at 1852.227-86, 
Commercial Computer Software--Licensing, in lieu of FAR 52.227-19, 
Commercial Computer Software--Restricted Rights, when it is considered 
appropriate for the acquisition of existing computer software in 
accordance with FAR 27.405(b)(2).

data to a foreign recipient will be in compliance with all applicable 
directives, including the NASA Export Control Program.


<R05>
1827.670-2  Contract clause.

    The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.227-87, 
Transfer of Technical Data Under Space Station International Agreements, 
in all solicitations, contracts, and purchase orders in support of Space 
Station program activities that may involve transfer of technical data 
subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, 22 CFR Parts 
120-130, or the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 
730-799 in accordance with the NASA Export Control Program.

<R05>
1828.311-2   Agency solicitation provisions and contract clauses.

    The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.228-71, 
Aircraft Flight Risks, in all cost-reimbursement contracts for the 
development, production, modification, maintenance, or overhaul of 
aircraft, or otherwise involving the furnishing of aircraft to the 
contractor, except when the aircraft are covered by a separate bailment.


<R05>
1828.370   Fixed-price contract clauses.

    (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.228-70, 
Aircraft Ground and Flight Risk, in all negotiated fixed-price contracts 
for the development, production, modification, maintenance, or overhaul 
of aircraft, or otherwise involving the furnishing of aircraft to the 
contractor, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, unless 
the aircraft are covered by a separate bailment. See the clause preface 
for directions for modifying the clause to accommodate various 
circumstances.
    (b) The Government need not assume the risk of aircraft damage, 
loss, or destruction as provided by the clause at 1852.228-70 if the 
best estimate of premium costs that would be included in the contract 
price for insurance coverage for such damage, loss, or destruction at 
any plant or facility is less than $500. If it is determined not to 
assume this risk, the clause at 1852.228-70 shall not be made a part of 
the contract, and the cost of necessary insurance to be obtained by the 
contractor to cover this risk shall be considered in establishing the 
contract price. In such cases, however, if performance of the contract 
is expected to involve the flight of Government-furnished aircraft, the 
substance of the clause at 1852.228-71, Aircraft Flight Risks, suitably 
adapted for use in a fixed-price contract, shall be used.
    (c) When the clause at 1852.228-70 is used, the term ``Contractor's 
premises'' shall be expressly defined in the contract Schedule and shall 
be limited to places where aircraft may be located during the 
performance of the contract. Contractor's premises may include, but are 
not limited to, those owned or leased by the contractor or those for 
which the contractor has a permit, license, or other right of use either 
exclusively or jointly with others, including Government airfields.

[[Page 277]]


<R05>
1828.371   Clauses for cross-waivers of liability for Space Shuttle services, Expendable Launch Vehicle (ELV) launches, and Space Station activities.

    (a) In agreements covering Space Shuttle services, certain ELV 
launches, and Space Station activities, NASA and other signatories (the 
parties) agree not to bring claims against each other for any damage to 
property or for injury or death of employees that occurs during the time 
such a cross-waiver is in effect. These agreements involving NASA and 
other parties include, but are not limited to, Memoranda of 
Understanding with foreign Governments, Launch Services Agreements, and 
other agreements for the use of NASA facilities. These agreements 
require the parties to flow down the cross-waiver provisions to their 
related entities so that contractors, subcontractors, customers, and 
other users of each party also waive their right to bring claims against 
other parties and their similarly related entities for damages arising 
out of activities conducted under the agreements. The purpose of the 
clauses prescribed in this section is to flow down the cross-waivers to 
NASA contractors and subcontractors.
    (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause 1852.228-72, 
Cross-waiver of Liability for Space Shuttle Services, in solicitations 
and contracts of $100,000 or more when the work to be performed involves 
``Protected Space Operations'' (applicable to the Space Shuttle) as that 
term is defined in the clause. If Space Shuttle services under the 
contract are being conducted in support of the Space Station program, 
the contracting officer shall insert the clause prescribed by paragraph 
(d) of this section and designate application of the clause to those 
particular activities.
    (c) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.228-78, 
Cross-Waiver of Liability for NASA Expendable Launch Vehicle (ELV) 
Launches, in solicitations and contracts of $100,000 or more for the 
acquisition of ELV launch services when the service is being acquired by 
NASA pursuant to an agreement described in paragraph (a) of this 
section. If, under a contract that covers multiple launches, only some 
of the launches are for payloads provided pursuant to such agreements, 
an additional clause shall be inserted in the contract to designate the 
particular launches to which this clause applies. If a payload is being 
launched by use of an ELV in support of the Space Station program, the 
contracting officer shall insert the clause prescribed by paragraph (d) 
of this section and designate application of the clause to that 
particular launch.
    (d) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.228-76, 
Cross-Waiver of Liability for Space Station Activities, in solicitations 
and contracts of $100,000 or more when the work is to be performed 
involves ``Protected Space Operations'' (relating to the Space Station) 
as that term is defined in the clause.
    (e) At the contracting officer's discretion, the clauses prescribed 
by paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section may be used in 
solicitations, contracts, new work modifications, or extensions, to 
existing contracts under $100,000 involving Space Shuttle activities, 
ELV launch services, or Space Station activities, respectively, in 
appropriate circumstances. Examples of such circumstances are when the 
value of contractor property on a Government installation used in 
performance of the contract is significant, or when it is likely that 
the contractor or subcontractor will have its valuable property exposed 
to risk or damage caused by other participants in the Space Shuttle 
services, ELV launches, or Space Station activities.


<R05>
1828.372  Clause for minimum insurance coverage.

    In accordance with FAR 28.306(b) and 28.307, the contracting officer 
may insert a clause substantially as stated at 1852.228-75, Minimum 
Insurance Coverage, in fixed-price solicitations and in cost-
reimbursement contracts. The contracting officer may modify the clause 
to require additional coverage, such as vessel liability, and higher 
limits if appropriate for a particular acquisition.

                Subpart 1830.2--CAS Program Requirements

1830.201-5   Waiver.

    The procurement officer shall forward all requests for waiver of CAS 
requirements to the Associate Administrator for Procurement (Code HC).


<R04>
 Subpart 1830.70--Facilities Capital Employed for Facilities in Use and 
                    for Facilities Under Construction


<R05>
1830.7001   Facilities capital employed for facilities in use.


<R05>
1830.7001-1   Contract facilities capital estimates.

    To estimate facilities capital cost of money (FCCOM), the 
contracting officer shall use DD Form 1861, Contract Facilities Capital 
Cost of Money, after evaluating the contractor's cost proposal, 
establishing cost of money factors, and developing a prenegotiation cost 
objective.


<R05>
1830.7001-2   DD For 1861 completion instructions.

    (a) List overhead pools and direct-charging services centers (if 
used) in the same structure as they appear on the contractor's cost 
proposal and Form CASB-CMF. The structure and allocation base units-of-
measure must be compatible on all three displays.
    (b) Extract appropriate contract overhead allocation base data, by 
year, from the evaluated cost breakdown or prenegotiation cost 
objective, and list them against each overhead pool and direct-charging 
service center.
    (c) Multiply each allocation base by its corresponding cost of money 
factor to compute the FCCOM estimated to be incurred each year. The sum 
of these products represents the estimated contract FCCOM for the year's 
effort.
    (d) Add the yearly estimates to calculate the total contract FCCOM.


<R05>
1830.7001-3   Preaward FCCOM applications.

    Apply FCCOM in establishing cost and price objectives as follows:
    (a) Cost objective. Us the FCCOM with normal, booked costs in 
establishing a cost objective or the target cost of an incentive type 
contract. Do not subsequently adjust these target costs when actual cost 
of money rates become available during the contract performance period.
    (b) Profit/fee objective. Do not include FCCOM in the cost base when 
establishing a prenegotiation profit/fee objective. Use only normal, 
booked costs in this cost base.


<R05>
1830.7001-4  Postaward FCCOM applications.

    (a) Interim billings based on costs incurred. (1) The contractor may 
include FCCOM in cost reimbursement and progress payment invoices. To 
determine the amount that qualifies as cost incurred, multiply the 
incurred portions of the overhead pool allocation bases by the latest 
available cost of money factors. These FCCOM calculations are interim 
estimates subject to adjustment.
    (2) As actual cost of money factors are finalized, use the new 
factors to calculate FCCOM for the next accounting period.
    (b) Final settlements. (1) Contract FCCOM for final cost 
determination or repricing is based on each year's final cost of money 
factors determined under CAS 414 and supported by separate Forms CASB-
CMF.
    (2) Separately compute contract FCCOM in a manner similar to yearly 
final overhead rates. As in overhead rates, include in the final 
settlement an adjustment from interim to final contract FCCOM. Do not 
adjust the contract estimated or target cost.


<R05>
1830.7002  Facilities capital employed for facilities under construction.


<R05>
1830.7002-1  Definitions.

    (a) Cost of money rate is either--
    (1) The interest rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury 
under Public Law 92-41 (85 Stat. 97); or
    (2) The time-weighted average of such rates for each cost accounting 
period during which the capital asset is being constructed, fabricated, 
or developed.
    (b) Representative investment is the calculated amount considered 
invested

[[Page 280]]

by the contractor during the cost accounting period to construct, 
fabricate, or develop the capital asset.


<R05>
1830.7002-2  Cost of money calculations.

    (a) The interest rate referenced in 1830.7002-1(a)(1) is established 
semi-annually and published in the Federal Register during the fourth 
week of December and June.
    (b) To calculate the time-weighted average interest rate referenced 
in 1830.7002-1(a)(2), multiply the rates in effect during the months of 
construction by the number of months each rate was in effect, and then 
divide the sum of the products by the total number of months.


<R05>
1830.7002-3  Representative investment calculations.

    (a) The calculation of the representative investment requires 
consideration of the rate or expenditure pattern of the costs to 
construct, fabricate, or develop a capital asset.
    (b) If the majority of the costs were incurred toward the beginning, 
middle, or end of the cost accounting period, the contractor shall 
either:
    (1) Determine a representative investment for the cost accounting 
period by calculating the average of the month-end balances for that 
cost accounting period; or
    (2) Treat month-end balances as individual representative 
investments.
    (c) If the costs were incurred in a fairly uniform expenditure 
pattern throughout the construction, fabrication, or development period, 
the contractor may either:
    (1) Determine a representative investment for the cost accounting 
period by averaging the beginning and ending balances of the 
construction, fabrication, or development cost account for the cost 
accounting period; or
    (2) Treat month-end balances as individual representative 
investments.
    (d) The method chosen by the contractor to determine the 
representative investment amount may be different for each capital asset 
being constructed, fabricated, or developed, provided the method fits 
the expenditure pattern of the costs incurred.


<R05>
1830.7002-4  Determining imputed cost of money.

    (a) Determine the imputed cost of money for an asset under 
construction, fabrication, or development by applying a cost of money 
rate (see 1830.7002-2) to the representative investment (see 1830.7002-
3).
    (1) When a representative investment is determined for a cost 
accounting period in accordance with 1830.7002-3(b)(1) or 1830.7002-
3(c)(1), the cost of money rate shall be the time-weighted average rate.
    (2) When a monthly representative investment is used in accordance 
with 1830.7002-3(b)(2) or 1830.7002-3(c)(2), the cost of money rate 
shall be that in effect each month. Under this method, the FCCOM is 
determined monthly, and the total for the cost accounting period is the 
sum of the monthly calculations.
    (b) The imputed cost of money will be capitalized only once in any 
cost accounting period, either at the end of the accounting period or 
the end of the construction, fabrication, or development period, 
whichever comes first.
    (c) When the construction, fabrication, or development of an asset 
takes more than one accounting period, the cost of money capitalized for 
the first accounting period will be included in determining the 
representative investment for any future cost accounting periods.

    (e)(1) The Director of the Headquarters Office of Procurement 
Analysis Division (Code HC) is the approval authority for all advance 
payments except the following:
    (A) The procurement officer is the approval authority for non-fee 
bearing contracts with domestic entities when the cumulative contract 
value is $25,000,000 or less, and for all increases to such contracts 
over $25,000,000 previously approved by Code HC as long as the advance 
payment amount outstanding at any time is not increased.
    (B) The contracting officer is the approval authority for the 
following actions. In these cases, a findings and determination (see FAR 
32.410) is not required.
    (a) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business 
Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I contracts. A class deviation has been 
signed, effective through September 30, 2000 (for SBIRs) and September 
30, 1997 (for STTRs), authorizing use of advance payments on these 
contracts. The contracting officer shall annotate the contract file that 
the deviation is on file at the NASA Headquarters Office of Procurement

<R05>
1832.410  Findings, determination, and authorization. (NASA supplements paragraph (b))

    (b) Generally, the format in FAR 32.410 should be used, tailored as 
follows:
    (i) In format subparagraph (a)(2), use the phrase ``Advance payments 
(In an amount not to exceed $* * * at any time outstanding)'' in all 
determinations and findings. The phrase means the maximum unliquidated 
dollar amount a contractor would need in advance payments at any point 
in time for the particular contract. The amount would not usually be the 
full contract value. The amount inserted should be based on an analysis 
of the

[[Page 284]]

contractor's financing needs (monthly or other appropriate period) for 
the specific contract involved.
    (ii) In the second sentence of format subparagraph (a)(4), delete 
the reference to a special bank account if no special bank account is 
required.
    (iii) Use format subparagraph (a)(6), and not (a)(7) or (a)(8).
    (iv) At the end of format paragraph (b), use ``is in the public 
interest.''
    (v) In format paragraph (c), use the phrase ``(the amount at any 
time outstanding)'' in all determinations and findings.


<R05>
1832.412  Contract clause. (NASA supplements paragraphs (a), (e) and (f))

    (a) When the clause at FAR 52.232-12, Advance Payments, is used, 
make the following modifications:
    (i) In the ``Maximum Payment'' paragraph (either paragraph (e) of 
the basic clause and Alternative II, or paragraph (d) of Alternative V), 
in the sentence that begins ``When the sum of'', change the word 
``When'' to lower case and insert before it: ``Unliquidated advance 
payments shall not exceed $. * * * at any time outstanding. In addition 
* * *''.
    (ii) In paragraph (m)(1) delete ``in the form prescribed by the 
administering office'' and substitute ``on Standard Form 272, Federal 
Cash Transactions Report, and, if appropriate, Standard Form 272-A, 
Federal Cash Transactions Report Continuation''.
    (iii) Annotate the clause ``as modified by NASA (October 1996)''.
    (e) See 1832.412(f).
    (f) The contracting officer shall use Alternates IV and V when 
advance payments are provided on Phase I contracts of the Small Business 
Innovation Research (SBIR or Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) 
programs. Annotate the clause ``as modified by NASA (October 1996)'', 
delete paragraph (a) of Alternate V, and substitute the following:

    (f) Requirements for payment. Advance payments will be made under 
this contract upon receipt of invoices from the Contractor. Invoices 
should be clearly marked ``Small Business Innovation Research Contract'' 
or ``Small Business Technology Transfer Contract,'' as appropriate, to 
expedite payment processing. One-third of the total contract price will 
be available to be advanced to the contractor immediately after award, 
another one-third will be advanced three months after award, and the 
final one-third will be paid upon acceptance by NASA of the Contractor's 
final report. By law, full payment must be made no later than 12 months 
after the date that contract requirements are completed. The Contractor 
shall flow down the terms of this clause to any subcontractor requiring 
advance payments.

<R05>
1832.702-70  NASA policy.

    (a) Cost-reimbursement contracts may be incrementally funded only if 
all the following conditions are met (except that, for cost-
reimbursement R&D contracts under which no supplies are deliverable, 
only the condition in paragraph (a)(3) of this section applies):
    (1) The total value of the contract (including options as defined in 
FAR subpart 17.2) is $1,000,000 or more.
    (2) The period of performance under the contract overlaps the 
succeeding fiscal year.
    (3) The funds are not available to fund the total contract value 
fully at award.
    (b) Fixed-price contracts, other than those for research and 
development, shall not be incrementally funded.
    (c)(1) Fixed-price contracts for research and development may be 
incrementally funded if the conditions in 1832.702-70(a) (1) through (3) 
are met and the initial funding of the contract is not less than 50 
percent of the total fixed price.
    (2) Incrementally funded fixed-price contracts shall be fully funded 
as soon as adequate funding becomes available.
    (d) The procurement officer, with the concurrence of the 
installation Comptroller, may waive any of the conditions set forth in 
paragraphs 1832.702-70 (a) through (c). The procurement officer shall 
maintain a record of all such approvals during the fiscal year.
    (e) A class deviation from the conditions set forth in paragraphs 
1832.702-70 (a) through (c) exists to permit incremental funding of 
contracts under Phase II of the Small Business Innovation Research 
(SBIR) Program (through September 30, 2000) and Phase II of the Small 
Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program (through September 30, 
1997). This deviation exists with the understanding that the contracts 
will be fully funded when funds become available.

                         Subpart 1834.0--General


<R05>
1834.003  Responsibilities. (NASA supplements paragraph (a))

    (a) NASA's implementation of OMB Circular No. A-109, Major Systems 
Acquisitions, and FAR part 34 is contained in this part and in NASA 
Policy Directive (NPD) 7120.4, ``Program/Project Management,'' and NASA 
Procedures and Guidance (NPG) 7120.5, ``Program/Project Management 
Guide''.


<R04>
              Subpart 1834.70--Acquisition of Major Systems


<R05>
1834.7001  Definitions.

    (a) Down-selection. In a phased acquisition, the process of 
selecting contractors for phases subsequent to the initial phase from 
among the preceding phase contractors.
    (b) Major system. For NASA, ``major system'' is a program fitting 
the criteria of FAR 34.003(c) in lieu of the definition provided in FAR 
2.101.
    (c) Phased acquisition. A program comprised of several distinct 
steps or phases where the realization of program objectives requires a 
planned, sequential acquisition of each step or phase. The phases may be 
acquired separately, in combination, or through a down-selection 
strategy.
    (d) Progressive competition. A type of down-selection strategy for a 
phased acquisition. In this method, a single solicitation is issued for 
all phases of this program. The initial phase contracts are awarded, and 
the contractors for subsequent phases are expected to be chosen through 
a down-selection from among the preceding phase contractors. In each 
phase, progressively fewer contracts are awarded until a single 
contractor is chosen for the final phase. Normally, all down-selections 
are accomplished without issuance of a new, formal solicitation.


<R05>
1834.7002  Phased acquisitions.

    (a) In acquisitions subject to the provisions of OMB Circular No. A-
109 and NPD 7120.4 and NPG 7120.5, or other similar phased acquisitions, 
it is NASA policy to ensure competition in the selection of contractors 
for award in each phase of the process not performed in-house.
    (b) There are five phases in the life cycle of a NASA major system 
acquisition:
    (1) Phase A, Preliminary Analysis, involves the analysis of 
alternate overall project concepts for accomplishing a proposed agency 
technical objective or mission.
    (2) Phase 3, Definition, involves the detailed study, comparative 
analysis, and preliminary system design of selected Phase A concepts.
    (3) Phase C, Design, involves the detailed system design (with mock-
ups and test articles of critical systems and subsystems) of the systems 
design concept determined to provide the best overall system for the 
Government.
    (4) Phase D, Development, involves final detailed design, 
fabrication, delivery of an operational system that meets program 
requirements.
    (5) Phase E, Operations, involves operation and use of the system in 
its intended environment, continuing until the system leaves the agency 
inventory. This phase includes any system modifications and upgrades.

[[Page 290]]

    (c) The preferred approach in NASA for the acquisition of the phases 
of a Major System is the following:
    (1) Phase A is accomplished primarily through in-house studies.
    (2) Phases B, C, and D are acquired through a phased acquisition 
process in which two or more Phase B contracts are awarded competitively 
and then a down-selection is made among these contractors to determine 
the single combined Phase C/D awardee.
    (3) Phase E is normally acquired separately.
    (d) Each phase of a major system acquisition not performed in-house 
must be synopsized in accordance with FAR 5.201 and must include all the 
information required by FAR 5.207.
    (e) Whether or not down-selection procedures are used, contracts 
awarded in phased acquisitions shall not include requirements for 
submission of subsequent phase proposals. Instead, proposals shall be 
requested through a solicitation or other appropriate mechanism (e.g., 
by letter when using the progressive competition technique). Priced 
options for preparation of subsequent phase proposals are prohibited.
    (f) Time gaps between phases should be minimized in all major system 
phased acquisitions. Accordingly, early synopsis of subsequent phase 
competition is encouraged. Also, when sufficient programmatic and 
technical information is available to all potential offerors, proposal 
evaluation and source selection activities need not be delayed until 
completion of a given phase. When appropriate, these activities should 
commence as early as practicable during the period of performance of a 
phase to ensure the expeditious award of the succeeding phase.


<R05>
1834.7003  Down-selections in phased acquisitions.


<R05>
1834.7003-1  Pre-solicitation planning.

    (a) The rationale for the use of the down-selection technique shall 
be thoroughly justified in the acquisition planning requirement. Because 
the Phase B solicitation will also lead to Phase C/D award, the decision 
to use a down-selection strategy must be made prior to initiation of the 
Phase B acquisition. Accordingly, both phases must be addressed in the 
initial acquisition strategy planning and documented in the acquisition 
plan or ASM minutes.
    (b) If there is no direct link between successful performance in the 
preceding phase and successful performance in the subsequent phase, 
down-selection is inappropriate. In this case, the major system 
acquisition phases should be contracted for separately without a down-
selection between phases.
    (c) With one exception, both the initial and subsequent phase(s) of 
a major system acquisition down-selection process are considered to be 
full and open competition if the procedures in 1834.7003-4 and 
1834.7003-5 (if using the progressive competition technique) are 
followed. If only one contractor successfully completed a given phase 
and no other offers are solicited for the subsequent phase, award of the 
subsequent phase may be made only if justified by one of the exceptions 
in FAR 6.302 or one of the exclusions in FAR 6.2, and only after 
compliance with the synopsis requirements of FAR 5.202 and 5.205, when 
appropriate.


<R05>
1834.7003-2  Evaluation factors.

    A separate set of evaluation factors must be developed for each 
phase in a down-selection competition. Since these competitive down-
selection strategies anticipate that one of the Phase B contractors will 
also be the Phase C/D contractor, the Phase B offerors must clearly 
demonstrate the ability to perform the subsequent phases. The evaluation 
factors for Phase B award must specifically include the evaluation of 
the Phase B offerors' abilities to perform Phase C/D as well as Phase B.


<R05>
1834.7003-3  Down-selection milestones.

    The Phase B contracts should be structured to allow for down-
selection at a discrete performance milestone such as a significant 
design review or at contract completion. This will avoid time gaps 
between phases and eliminate unnecessary duplication of effort and the 
need to terminate the remaining Phase B efforts of an unsuccessful

[[Page 291]]

Phase C/D offeror. However, the appropriate contract structure must 
reflect program technical objectives as well as schedule considerations. 
For example, if the acquisition strategy calls for formal completion of 
Phase B effort at Preliminary Design Review (PDR), but it is not 
financially practical or technically necessary for Phase C/D award and 
performance to carry all Phase B contractors through PDR, the Phase B 
contracts should be structured with a basic period of performance 
through a significant, discrete milestone before PDR with a priced 
option for effort from that milestone to PDR. The down-selection would 
occur at the earlier milestone, the PDR option exercised only for the 
down-selection winner, and Phase C/D performance begun at the completion 
of the PDR option. Any down-selection milestone must ensure that 
sufficient design maturity exists to allow for an informed selection 
decision leading to a successful completion of Phase C/D.


<R05>
1834.7003-4  Synopsis.

    (a) When the phased acquisition process identified in 
1834.7002(c)(2) is used, the synopsis for the initial competitive phase, 
normally Phase B, should also state the following:
    (1) The Government plans to conduct a phased acquisition involving a 
competitive down-selection process. (Include a description of the 
process and the phases involved).
    (2) Subsequent competitions for identified follow-on phases will 
build on the results of previous phases.
    (3) The award criteria for subsequent phases will include 
demonstrated completion of specified previous phase requirements.
    (4) The Government expects that only the initial phase contractors 
will be capable of successfully competing for the subsequent phase(s). 
Proposals for the subsequent phase(s) will be automatically requested 
from these contractors.
    (5) The Government intends to issue (or not issue) a new, formal 
solicitation(s) for subsequent phase(s). If new solicitations are not 
planned, the acquisition must be identified as a ``progressive 
competition'' (see 1834.7003-5), and the mechanism for providing 
pertinent subsequent phase proposal information (e.g., statements of 
work, specifications, proposal preparation instructions, and evaluation 
factors for award) must be described.
    (6) Each subsequent phase of the acquisition will be synopsized.
    (7) Notwithstanding the expectation that only the initial phase 
contractors will be capable of successfully competing for the subsequent 
phase(s), proposals from all responsible sources submitted by the 
specified due date will be considered by the agency. In order to contend 
for subsequent phase awards, however, such prospective offerors must 
demonstrate a design maturity equivalent to that of the prior phase 
contractors. Failure to fully and completely demonstrate the appropriate 
level of design maturity may render the proposal unacceptable with no 
further consideration for contract award.
    (b) In addition to the information in paragraph (a) of this section, 
the synopsis for the subsequent phases, normally a combined C/D, must 
identify the current phase contractors.


<R05>
1834.7003-5  Progressive competition.

    (a) To streamline the major system acquisition process, the 
preferred approach for NASA phased acquisitions is the ``progressive 
competition'' down-selection technique in which new, formal 
solicitations are not issued for phases subsequent to the initial phase. 
Subsequent phase proposals are requested by less formal means, normally 
by a letter accompanied by the appropriate proposal preparation and 
evaluation information.
    (b) When using the progressive competition technique, if a 
prospective offeror other than one of the preceding phase contractors 
responds to the synopsis for a subsequent phase and indicates an 
intention to submit a proposal, the contracting officer shall provide to 
that offeror all the material furnished to the preceding phase 
contractors necessary to submit a proposal. This information includes 
the preceding phase solicitation, contracts, and system performance and 
design requirements, as well as all proposal

[[Page 292]]

preparation instructions and evaluation factors. In addition, the 
prospective offerors must be advised of all requirements necessary for 
demonstration of a design maturity equivalent to that to the preceding 
phase contractors.
    (c) Although a key feature of the progressive competition technique 
is that a formal solicitation is issued for the initial phase only, a 
new, formal solicitation may nonetheless be required for subsequent 
phases. When the Government requirements or evaluation procedures change 
so significantly after release of the initial phase solicitation that a 
substantial portion of the information provided in the initial phase 
synopsis, solicitation, or contract is invalidated, a new solicitation 
shall be issued for the next phase.
    (d) Phase C/D proposals should be requested by a letter including 
the following:
    (1) A specified due date for the proposals along with a statement 
that FAR 52.215-10, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of 
Proposals, applies to this proposal due date.
    (2) Complete instructions for proposal preparation, including page 
limitations, if any.
    (3) Final evaluation factors.
    (4) Any statement of work, specifications, or other contract 
requirements that have changed since the Phase B solicitation.
    (5) All required clause changes applicable to new work effective 
since Phase B contract award.
    (6) Any representations or certifications, if required.
    (7) Any other required contract updates (e.g., Phase C/D small and 
small disadvantaged business goals).
    (e) Certain factors may clearly dictate that the progressive 
competition techniques should not be used. For example, if it is likely 
that NASA may introduce a design concept independent of those explored 
by the Phase B contractors, it is also likely that a new, formal 
solicitation is necessary for Phase C/D and all potential offerors 
should be solicited. In this circumstance, progressive competition is 
inappropriate.

<R05>
1835.016-70  NASA Research Announcements

    (a) Scope. An NRA is used to announce research interests in support 
of NASA's programs, and, after peer or scientific review using factors 
in the NRA, select proposals for funding. Unlike an RFP containing a 
statement of work or specification to which offerors are to respond, an 
NRA provides for the submission of competitive project ideas, conceived 
by the offerors, in one or more program areas of interest. An NRA shall 
not be used when the requirement is sufficiently defined to specify an 
end product or service.
    (b) Issuance. (1) Before issuance, each field-generated NRA shall be 
approved by the installation director or designee, with the concurrence 
of the procurement officer, and each Headquarters-generated NRA shall be 
approved by the cognizant Program Associate Administrator or designee, 
with the concurrence of the Headquarters Offices of General Counsel 
(Code GK) and Procurement (Code HS). The NRA approval authority shall 
designate the selection official.
    (2) The selecting official shall assure that the NRA is synopsized 
prior to issuance in accordance with FAR 5.201 and 1805.201. The 
synopsis shall be brief, and the technical section describing the area 
of interest should not exceed 50 words.
    (3) If a Headquarters-generated NRA may result in awards by a NASA 
field installation, the issuing office shall notify the installation 
procurement officer and provide a copy of the NRA.
    (4) The selecting official is responsible for the preparation and 
distribution of the NRA.
    (5) NRAs normally shall remain open for at least 90 days.
    (c) Content. The NRA shall consist of the following sections and 
items. The entire package shall be provided in response to requests.
    (1) Cover. The cover shall display:
    (i) ``OMB Approval Number 2700-0087'' in the upper right corner.
    (ii) Title.
    (iii) ``NASA Research Announcement Soliciting Research Proposals for 
the Period Ending

                               ________''.

    (iv) NRA number.
    (v) Official address for the office issuing the NRA.
    (2) Summary and Supplemental Information. (i) The Summary and 
Supplemental Information should not exceed two pages and shall include:
    (A) Title and NRA number.
    (B) Introductory paragraphs describing the purpose of the NRA and 
the period for receipt of proposals.
    (C) Address for submitting proposals.
    (D) Number of copies required.
    (E) Selecting official's title.
    (F) Names, addresses, and telephone numbers for the technical and 
contracting points of contact.
    (G) The following statement when the NRA is to be issued before 
funds are available:

    Funds are not currently available for awards under this NRA. The 
Government's obligation to make award(s) is contingent upon the 
availability of appropriated funds from which payment can be made and 
the receipt of proposals that NASA determines are acceptable for award 
under this NRA.

    (ii) The Summary and Supplemental Information may include estimates 
of the amount of funds that will be available and the number of 
anticipated

[[Page 294]]

awards. A breakdown of the estimates by research area may also be shown.
    (3) Technical Description. The first page shall contain the NRA 
number and title at the top. A brief description not exceeding two pages 
is preferable, but it should be detailed enough to enable ready 
comprehension of the research areas of interest. Specifications 
containing detailed statements of work should be avoided. Any program 
management information included must be limited to matters that are 
essential for proposal preparation.
    (4) Instructions for Responding to NASA Research Announcements. The 
NRA shall contain instructions as stated in 1852.235-72 (see 
1835.070(c)).
    (d) Receipt of proposals, evaluation, and selection. (1) Proposals 
shall be protected as provided in 1815.508-70 and 1815.509-70.
    (2) Late proposals and modifications shall be treated in accordance 
with 1815.412-70.
    (3) The selection decision shall be made following peer or 
scientific review of a proposal. Peer or scientific review shall involve 
evaluation by an in-house specialist, a specialist outside NASA, or 
both. Evaluation by specialists outside NASA shall be conducted subject 
to the conditions in FAR 15.413-2(f) and 1815.413-2. After receipt of a 
proposal and before selection, scientific or engineering personnel shall 
communicate with an offeror only for the purpose of clarification (as 
defined in FAR 15.601), or to understand the meaning of some aspect of 
the proposal that is not clear, or to obtain confirmation or 
substantiation of a proposed approach, solution, or cost estimate.
    (4) Competitive range determinations shall not be made, and best and 
final offers shall not be requested.
    (5) Part of a proposal may be selected unless the offeror requests 
otherwise. In addition, changes to a selected proposal may be sought if 
(i) the ideas or other aspects of the proposal on which selection is 
based are contained in the proposal as originally submitted, and are not 
introduced by the changes; and (ii) the changes sought would not involve 
a material alteration to the requirements stated in the NRA. Changes 
that would affect a proposal's selection shall not be sought. When 
changes are desired, the selecting official may request revisions from 
the offeror or request the contracting officer to implement them during 
negotiations with the successful offeror(s). The changes shall not 
transfer information from one offeror's proposal to another offeror (see 
FAR 15.610(e)(1)). When collaboration between offerors would improve 
proposed research programs, collaboration may be suggested to the 
offerors.
    (6) The basis for selection of a proposal shall be documented in a 
selection statement applying the evaluation factors in the NRA. The 
selection statement represents the conclusions of the selecting official 
and must be self-contained. It shall not incorporate by reference the 
evaluations of the reviewers.
    (7) The selecting official shall notify each offeror whose proposal 
was not selected for award and explain generally why the proposal was 
not selected. If requested, the selecting official shall arrange a 
debriefing under FAR 15.1004, with the participation of a contracting 
officer.
    (8) The selecting official shall forward to the contracting officer 
the following information:
    (i) A copy of the NRA;
    (ii) The results of the technical evaluation, including the total 
number of proposals received, the selection statement, and the 
proposal(s) selected for funding;
    (iii) A description of any changes desired in any offeror's 
statement of work, including the reasons for the changes and any effect 
on level of funding;
    (iv) If a contract will be used to fund the proposal, a description 
of deliverables, including technical reports, and delivery dates, 
consistent with the requirements of the NRA;
    (v) A procurement request;
    (vi) Comments on the offeror's cost proposal (either the selecting 
official's comments, which may be based on the reviewer's comments, or 
copies of the reviewers' comments with any different conclusions of the 
selecting official); these comments shall address the need for and 
reasonableness of travel, computer time, materials, equipment, 
subcontracted items, publication costs,

[[Page 295]]

labor hours, labor mix, and other costs; and
    (vii) A copy of the selected proposal as originally submitted, any 
revisions, and any correspondence from the successful offeror.
    (9) The selecting official may provide to the contracting officer 
copies of the reviewers' evaluations. Reviewers' names and institutions 
may be omitted.
    (10) The selecting official may provide each offeror whose proposal 
was selected for negotiation a notification stating:
    (i) The proposal has been selected for negotiation;
    (ii) The offeror's business office will be contacted by a 
contracting officer, who is the only official authorized to obligate the 
Government; and
    (iii) Any costs incurred by the offeror in anticipation of an award 
are at the offeror's risk.
    (e) Award. The contracting officer shall choose the appropriate 
award instrument. If a contract is selected, the contracting officer 
shall----
    (1) Advise the offeror that the Government contemplates entering 
into negotiations; the type of contract contemplated; and the estimated 
award date, anticipated effort, and delivery schedule;
    (2) Send the offeror a model contract, if necessary, including 
modifications contemplated in the offeror's statement of work, and 
request agreement or identification of any exceptions (the contract 
statement of work may summarize the proposed research, state that the 
research shall be conducted in accordance with certain technical 
sections of the proposal (which shall be identified by incorporating 
them into the contract by reference), and identify any changes to the 
proposed research);
    (3) Request the offeror to complete and return certifications and 
representations and Standard Form 33, Solicitation, Offer, and Award, or 
other appropriate forms;
    (4) Conduct negotiations in accordance with FAR subparts 15.8 and 
15.9, as applicable;
    (5) Award a contract; and
    (6) Comply with FAR subparts 4.6 and 5.3 on contract reporting and 
synopses of contract awards.
    (f) Cancellation of an NRA. when program changes, program funding,

1841.205-70  Authorization for acquisition of wellhead natural gas.

    (a) Acquisition of wellhead natural gas and interstate 
transportation of the natural gas to locally franchised distribution 
utility companies' receipt points (city gate) is considered the 
acquisition of supplies rather than the acquisition of public utility 
services described in FAR Part 41. Therefore, wellhead natural gas and 
interstate transportation of such gas should be obtained directly by 
NASA under applicable authorities and FAR procedures governing the 
acquisition of supplies. Redelivery of the gas from the city gate to the 
NASA facility is considered a utility service since it is provided only 
by the locally franchised utility. GSA is responsible for obtaining an 
appropriate contract for the redelivery service in accordance with FAR 
41.204.
    (b) GSA provides assistance to Federal agencies in the acquisition 
of natural gas wellhead supplies. Contracting officers may obtain 
assistance from GSA in the acquisition of wellhead natural gas by 
contacting GSA at the address specified in FAR 41.301(a).

<R04>
 Subpart 1842.1--Interagency Contract Administration and Audit Services


<R05>
1842.101  Policy. (NASA supplements paragraph (a))

    (a)(i) The Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) has been designated 
as the DOD agency responsible for the performance of audit functions for 
NASA contracts, except those awarded to educational institutions for 
which other agencies have audit cognizance under OMB Circular No. 88, 
those with Canadian contractors, and those for which NASA will perform 
audits.
    (ii) Cross-servicing arrangements are the responsibility of the 
Headquarters Office of External Relations (Code ID). Contracting 
officers should direct questions to the Headquarters Office of 
Procurement (Code HS).


<R05>
1842.102  Procedures.


<R05>
1842.102-70  Review of administration and audit services.

    (a) NASA installations shall assess their delegations to DOD 
semiannually to determine changes in delegation patterns that could (1) 
result in significant changes in DOD manpower requirements or (2) have 
other important impacts on DOD contract administration activities. 
Events such as major program cutbacks or expansions, changes in 
locations of major programs, and sizable new acquisitions should be 
considered in the assessment.
    (b) A summary of significant changes shall be submitted to the 
Headquarters

[[Page 303]]

Office of Procurement (Code HK). The summary shall include--
    (1) A description of the change in work requirements or delegation 
pattern;
    (2) The estimated duration of the impact;
    (3) The results of discussions with affected DOD contract 
administration offices including agreement and disagreements on the 
predicted impact on DOD in terms of changes in manpower requirements or 
other costs; and
    (4) Any other significant impact on DOD or NASA resources or 
contract performance risk.


<R05>
1842.170  Assignment of NASA personnel at contractor plants.

    (a)(1) NASA personnel normally shall not be assigned at or near a 
contractor's facility to perform any contract administration functions 
listed in FAR 42.302(a). Before such an assignment is made, a written 
request shall be forwarded to the cognizant program director for 
approval with the concurrence of the Associate Administrator for 
Procurement (Code HS). The following supporting information shall be 
forwarded with the request to make the assignment:
    (i) A statement of the special circumstances that necessitate the 
assignment.
    (ii) The contract administration serves to be performed.
    (iii) A summary of any discussions held with the cognizant contract 
administration organization.
    (iv) A staffing plan covering three years or such shorter period as 
may be appropriate.
    (2) The provisions of this paragraph (a) do not apply to NASA audit 
personnel assigned to the field installations, to NASA technical 
personnel covered by 1842.101 and paragraph (b) of this section, unless 
they are performing any contract administration functions listed in FAR 
42.302(a), or to personnel assigned to contractors' plants on NASA or 
other Federal installations.
    (b) NASA may assign technical personnel (such as quality assurance, 
reliability, or engineering representatives) to contractors' plants or 
laboratories to provide direct liaison with NASA and technical 
assistance and guidance to the contractor and DOD. The duties and 
responsibilities of these technical representatives shall be clearly 
defined and shall not conflict with, duplicate, or overlap with 
functions delegated to DOD personnel. NASA shall advise appropriate DOD 
and contractor organizations of the duties and responsibilities of NASA 
technical personnel.
    (c) When a NASA resident office, including any assigned technical 
personnel, and a DOD contract administration office are performing 
contract administration functions for NASA contracts at the same 
contractor's facility, the two offices shall execute a written agreement 
clearly establishing the relationship between the two organizations and 
the contractor. The agreement should eliminate duplication in the 
performance of contract administration functions and minimize procedural 
misunderstandings between the two organizations. Such agreements shall 
be consistent with existing delegations to the contract administration 
offices concerned and shall specify the relationship of NASA 
nonprocurement resident personnel to their DOD and contractor 
counterparts if such personnel will be involved in any aspect of 
contract administration.


<R04>
          Subpart 1842.2--Assignment of Contract Administration


<R05>
1842.202  Assignment of contract administration. (NASA supplements paragraphs (b) and (d))

    (b) Withholding normal functions. (1) The following functions are 
normally retained by the contracting office.
    (A) Approval of the final voucher (FAR 42.302(a)(7)).
    (B) Countersigning NASA Form 456, Notice of Contract Costs Suspended 
and/or Disapproved (FAR 42.302(a)(8)).
    (C) Issuance of decisions under the disputes clause (FAR 
42.302(a)(10)).
    (D) Contract payment (FAR 42.302(a)(13)).
    (E) Execution of supplement agreements involving spare parts or 
other items selected through provisioning procedures. However, 
delegation of the negotiation of supplemental agreements for spare parts 
and other items

[[Page 304]]

and forwarding for approval and signature of the NASA contracting 
officer is permitted (FAR 42.302(a)(22)).
    (F) Executive of supplemental agreements definitizing change orders 
(see FAR 42.302(b)(1)).
    (G) Issuing termination notices and executing supplemental 
agreements for settlement of termination for default or for convenience 
of the Government. However, delegation of the negotiation of termination 
settlements and forwarding for approval and signature of the NASA 
contracting officer is permitted using NASA Form 1432 (FAR 
42.302(a)(23)).
    (H) Consent to placement of subcontracts under FAR 42.302(a)(51). 
(See 1844.202-1(a)).
    (d) Transmittal and documentation. In addition to the instructions 
at FAR 42.202(d) (1) through (4), contracting officers shall--
    (i) Send delegations to DOD contract administration offices in 
accordance with the instructions in the DOD Directory of Contract 
Administration Services Components (DLAH 4105.4).
    (ii) At time of contract award, prepared and forward NASA Form 1430, 
Letter of Contract Administration Delegation, General, to the contract 
administration office. NASA Form 1430A, Letter of Contract 
Administration, Special Instructions, will supplement the NASA Form 
1430, to modify previously delegated functions and provide additional or 
particular information considered necessary to ensure clear 
understanding of all delegated functions.
    (iii) Forward NASA Form 1431, Letter of Acceptance of Contract 
Administration, with each NASA Form 1430 or 1430A. Contracting officers 
shall use the returned NASA Form 1431 as contract file documentation 
that the delegation has been accepted, modified or rejected by the 
contract administration office and as a reference for points of contract 
for each of the functional areas delegated.
    (iv) Use NASA Form 1433, Letter of Audit Delegation, to delegate the 
audit function and to amend previous delegations. Distribute copies of 
the contract and NASA Form 1433 as follows:
    (A) Audit office: One copy of the contract and three NASA Forms 
1433. When the Department of Health and Human Services is designated as 
the audit office, item 12 on NASA Form 1433 shall be marked ``Not 
applicable.''
    (B) Contractor: One NASA Form 1433.
    (C) Cognizant NASA fiscal or financial management office: One NASA 
Form 1433.
    (v) For contracts with the Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC), 
audits are automatically arranged by the Department of Defense 
Production (Canada) (DDP) in accordance with agreements between NASA and 
DDP. Upon advice from DDP, CCC will certify the invoice and forward it 
with Standard Form 1034, Public Voucher, to the contracting officer for 
further processing and transmittal to the fiscal or financial management 
officer.
    (vi) For contracts placed directly with Canadian firms, audits are 
requested by the contracting officer from the Audit Services Branch, 
Comptroller of the Treasury, Department of Finance, Ottawa, Ontario, 
Canada. Invoices are approved by the auditor on a provisional basis 
pending completion of the contract and final audit. These invoices, 
accompanied by SF 1034, are forwarded to the contracting officer for 
further processing and transmittal to the fiscal or financial management 
officer. Periodic advisory audit reports are furnished directly to the 
contracting officer.


<R05>
1842.203  Retention of contract administration. (NASA supplements paragraph (a))

    (a) The assignment of contract administration is optional for the 
following contracts:
    (i) Research and development study contracts not involving 
deliverable hardware or Government furnished property.
    (ii) Contracts with delivery schedules for 90 days or less.
    (iii) Purchase orders without Government source inspection 
requirements.
    (iv) Contracts requiring only on-site performance.
    (v) Contracts requiring work in the vicinity of the awarding center 
where DOD contract administration services are not reasonably available.

[[Page 305]]


<R05>
1842.270  Contracting officer technical representative (COTR) delegations.

    (a) Contracting officers may appoint a qualified Government employee 
to act as their technical representatives in managing the technical 
aspects of a particular contract. If necessary, the contracting officer 
may appoint an alternate COTR to act during short absences of the COTR. 
Technical organizations are responsible for ensuring that the individual 
they recommend to the contracting officer possesses training, 
qualifications and experience commensurate with the duties and 
responsibilities to be delegated and the nature of the contract.
    (b) NASA Form 1634, Contracting Officer Technical Representative 
(COTR) Delegation, shall be used to appoint COTRs. A COTR's duties and 
responsibilities may not be redelegated by the COTR and the COTR may be 
held personally liable for unauthorized acts. However, this does not 
prohibit the COTR from receiving assistance for the purpose of 
monitoring contractor progress and gathering information. When an 
individual is appointed as a COTR on more than one contract, separate 
delegations shall be issued for each contract. A separate NASA Form 1634 
will be used to appoint an alternate COTR.
    (c) A COTR delegation remains in effect throughout the life of the 
contract unless canceled in writing by the cognizant contracting officer 
or at any level above that contracting officer. The contracting officer 
may modify the delegation only by issuance of a new delegation canceling 
and superseding the existing delegation.
    (d) A COTR shall not be authorized to initiate procurement actions 
or in any way cause a change to the contract or increase the 
Government's financial obligations. However, delegations may be made to 
construction contract COTRs to sign emergency on-site change orders with 
an estimated value not to exceed the value specified in writing by the 
contracting officer in the NASA Form 1634 but in no event to exceed 
$25,000.
    (e) Each COTR shall acknowledge receipt and accept the delegation by 
signing the original delegation letter. The original of the COTR 
delegation letter shall be filed in the applicable contract file. Copies 
of the signed COTR delegation letter shall be distributed to the COTR, 
the contractor, and each cognizant contract administration office. 
Acknowledgment and distribution for terminations of COTR delegations and 
COTR delegations which revise authority, duties and responsibilities 
shall follow the same rules.
    (f) Mandatory training for COTRs and their alternates shall include 
the following core topic areas: contracting authority; procurement 
integrity; performance-based contracting; contract modifications; 
surveillance plans; contracting for inherently governmental functions, 
personal services, and NASA policy on the acquisition of services; the 
Service Contract Act; the Anti-Deficiency Act; contract financial 
management; the ``Changes'' clause; the ``Disputes'' clause; the 
``Inspection'' clause; Government property and policy procedures; and 
the ``Limitation of Funds'' and ``Limitation of Cost'' clauses. 
Procurement officers are responsible for assuring that the course(s) 
utilized by their installation address the mandatory core topics in 
sufficient detail for the purpose of COTR training.
    (g) The contracting officer shall verify that the COTR has received 
the mandatory training before signing NASA Form 1634. If an urgent need 
arises for the appointment of a COTR and no trained and otherwise 
qualified individual is available, then the procurement officer may make 
a temporary COTR appointment not to exceed six months. Temporary 
appointments must be so identified and clearly reflect the appointment 
expiration date.
    (h) No technical direction may be issued by a COTR relative to 
performance-based contract requirements or when serving under a 
temporary appointment.


<R05>
1842.271  NASA clause.

    Insert the clause at 1852.242-70, Technical Direction, when 
paragraph 3(m) of the NASA Form 1634 specifically authorizes a COTR to 
issue technical direction.

    (1) A postaward conference shall be held with representatives of the 
contract administration office when--
    (i) A contract is expected to exceed $10,000,000;
    (ii) Contract performance is required at or near a NASA installation 
or NASA-controlled launch site;
    (iii) The delegation will impose an abnormal demand on the resources 
of the contract administration office receiving the delegation; or
    (iv) Complex contract management problems are expected.
    (2) Procurement officer approval is required to waive a post-award 
planning conference for contracts meeting any of the criteria in 
paragraph (1) of this section. The request for procurement officer 
approval to waive a post-award conference shall address action taken and 
planned to ensure effective communication with the contract 
administration office during the performance of the contract.

1842.705  Final indirect cost rates.


<R05>
1842.705-1  Contracting officer determination procedure. (NASA supplements paragraph (a))

    (a) Applicability and responsibility. (i) Since many NASA 
contractors are under DOD's final overhead rate determination procedure, 
NASA's policy is to participate jointly with DOD for those companies 
where NASA has a major financial interest. The NASA participant shall be 
a representative from that installation having the predominance of NASA 
work.
    (ii) When NASA has been assigned the final indirect cost rate 
determination authority, settlement of indirect costs shall be conducted 
by the cognizant NASA contracting officer (normally from the 
installation providing the preponderance of NASA funding).


<R05>
1842.708  Quick-closeout procedure.

    (a)(2)(ii) The 15 percent parameter does not apply to NASA 
contracts. Instead, perform a risk analysis that takes into 
consideration the contractor systems identified in FAR 42.708(a)(2)(ii), 
as well as the concerns of the cognizant contract auditor, and any other 
pertinent information.
[62 FR 36228, July 7, 1997]


<R05>
1842.708-70  NASA quick-closeout procedures.

    After a decision is made that the use of quick closeout is 
appropriate, the contracting officer shall:
    (a) Obtain a written agreement from the contractor to participate in 
the quick-closeout process under FAR 42.708 for the selected 
contract(s).
    (b) Require the contractor to submit a final voucher and a summary 
of all costs by cost element and fiscal year for the contract(s) in 
question, as well as a copy of the contractor's final indirect cost rate 
proposal for each fiscal year quick closeout is involved.
    (c) Notify the cognizant audit activity in writing, identify the 
contract(s), and request: (1) the contractor's indirect cost history 
covering a sufficient number of fiscal years to see the trend of 
claimed, audit questioned, and disallowed costs; and (2) any other 
information that could impact the decision to use quick-closeout 
procedures. Indirect cost histories should be requested from the 
contractor only when the cognizant audit activity is unable to provide 
the information.
    (d) Review the contract(s) for indirect cost rate ceilings and any 
other contract limitations, as well as the rate history information.
    (e) Establish final indirect cost rates using one of the following 
rates:
    (1) The contract's ceiling indirect cost rates, if applicable, and 
if less than paragraphs (e)(2) through (e)(6) of this section.
    (2) The contractor's claimed actual rates adjusted based on the 
contractor's indirect cost history, if less than paragraphs (e)(3) 
through (e)(6) of this section.
    (3) Recommended rates from the cognizant audit agency, the local 
pricing

[[Page 307]]

office, another installation pricing office, or other recognized 
knowledgeable source.
    (4) The contractor's negotiated billing rates, if less than 
paragraphs (e)(5) or (e)(6) of this section.
    (5) The previous year's final rates.
    (6) Final rates for another fiscal year closest to the period for 
which quick-closeout rates are being established.
    (f) If an agreement is reached with the contractor, obtain a release 
of all claims and other applicable closing documents.
    (g) For those contracts where the indirect cost rate negotiation 
function was delegated or falls under the cognizance of another agency, 
send a copy of the agreement to that office.


<R04>
                  Subpart 1842.8--Disallowance of Costs


<R05>
1842.803  Disallowing costs after incurrance. (NASA supplements paragraph (b))

    (b) Auditor receipt of vouchers. (1) NASA has designated the 
contract auditor as the contracting officer's representative for--
    (A) Reviewing vouchers received directly from contractors;
    (B) Approving vouchers for provisional payment and sending them to 
the disbursing office;
    (C) Reviewing completion/final vouchers and sending them to the 
designated contracting officer for approval.
    (2)(A) When contract costs are questioned, the auditor shall prepare 
and send to the cognizant contracting officer NASA Form 456, Notice of 
Contract Costs Suspended and/or Disapproved.
    (B) After coordination with other NASA and Federal agency 
contracting officers administering contracts with the same contractor 
under which a NASA Form 456 or a DCAA Form 1 has been issued for the 
same items of cost, the NASA contracting officer shall take one of the 
following actions:
    (a) Assign a notice number and sign the NASA Form 456.
    (b) Issue a new NASA Form 456 suspending the costs rather than 
disapproving them pending resolution of the issues.
    (c) Return the unsigned NASA Form 456 to the auditor with a detailed 
explanation of why the suspension or disapproval is not being signed, 
and process the contractor's claim for payment.
    (C) When more than one NASA contract is affected by a notice, the 
NASA contracting officer with the largest amount of contract dollars 
affected is responsible for coordination of the NASA Form 456 with the 
other contracting officers, including those of other Federal agencies, 
listed in the notice.
    (D) An original and three copies (which includes two acknowledgment 
copies, one each for return to the contracting officer and the auditor) 
of the NASA Form 456 shall be sent to the contractor by certified mail, 
return receipt requested; one copy shall be attached to the Standard 
Form 1034 and each copy of the Standard Form 1034A on which the 
deduction for the suspension/disapproval is made.
    (E)(a) If the amount of the deduction is more than the amount of the 
public voucher, the installment method of deduction shall be applied to 
the current and subsequent public vouchers until the amount is fully 
liquidated. The deductions on any voucher may not exceed the voucher 
amount to avoid processing of a voucher in a credit amount. Public 
voucher(s) with zero amounts must be forwarded to the fiscal or 
financial management office for appropriate action.
    (b) If deductions are in excess of contractor claims, recovery may 
be made through a direct refund from the contractor, in the form of a 
check payable to NASA, or by a set-off deduction from the voucher(s) 
submitted by the contractor under any other contract unless those 
contracts contain a ``no set-off'' provision. If a set-off is affected, 
the voucher(s) from which the deduction is made should be annotated to 
identify the contract and appropriation affected and the applicable NASA 
Form 456.

have access to the installation during Government holidays. This 
alternate may be appropriately modified for fixed-price contracts.
    (c) The clause may be used with its Alternate II in cost-
reimbursement contracts when Alternate I is used and it is desired that 
administrative leave be granted contractor personnel in special 
circumstances, such as inclement weather or potentially hazardous 
conditions.


<R05>
1842.7002  Travel outside of the United States.

    The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.242-71,

[[Page 309]]

contractor after payment. This copy shall be transmitted quarterly by 
the contractor with the freight bills to the General Services 
Administration. When a voucher is identified as the ``Completion 
Voucher,'' an additional copy shall be submitted for transmittal to the 
NASA contracting officer.


<R04>
     Subpart 1842.72--NASA Contractor Financial Management Reporting


<R05>
1842.7201  General.

    (a) Contracting officer responsibilities. (1) Contracting officers 
must ensure contracts require cost reporting consistent with both policy 
requirements and project needs. Contracting Officers shall monitor 
contractor cost reports on a regular basis to ensure cost data reported 
is accurate and timely.
    Adverse trends or discrepancies discovered in cost reports should be 
pursued through discussions with financial and project team members.
    (2) Whenever cost performance threatens contract performance, 
contracting officers shall require corrective action plans from the 
contractors.
    (b) Reporting requirements. (1) Use of the NASA Contractor Financial 
Management Reports, the NASA form 533 series, is required on cost-type, 
price redetermination, and fixed-price incentive contracts when the 
following dollar, period of performance, and scope criteria are met:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Contract value/scope           Period of performance             533M                      533Q         
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$500K to $999K......................  1 year or more.........  Required................  Optional.              
$1,000,000 and over.................  Less than 1 year.......  Required................  Optional.              
$1,000,000 and over.................  1 year or more.........  Required................  Required.              
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) When it is probable that a contract will ultimately meet the 
criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of this section through change orders, 
supplemental agreements, etc., the reporting requirement must be 
implemented in the contract based on the estimated final contract value 
at the time of award.
    (3) NF 533Q reporting may be waived by the contracting officer, with 
the concurrence of the center chief financial officer and cognizant 
project manager, for support service or task order contracts, when NF 
533M reports and other data are sufficient to ensure accurate monthly 
cost accruals, evaluation of the contractor's cost performance, and 
forecasting of resource requirements.
    (4) Where a specific contractual requirement differs from the 
standard system set forth in NPG 9501.2, NASA Contractor Financial 
Management Reporting, but is determined to be in the best interests of 
the Government and does not eliminate any of the data elements required 
by the standard NF 533 formats, it may be approved by the contracting 
officer with the concurrence of the center chief financial officer and 
the project manager. Such approval shall be documented and retained, 
with the supporting rationale, in the contract file.
    (5) The contractor's internal automated printout reports may be 
substituted for the 533 reporting formats only if the substitute reports 
contain all the data elements that would be provided by the 
corresponding 533's. The contracting officer shall coordinate any 
proposed substitute with the installation financial management office.
    (c) Contract requirements. (1) Reporting requirements, including a 
description of reporting categories, shall be detailed in the 
procurement request, and reports shall be required by inclusion of the 
clause prescribed in 1842.7202. The contract schedule shall include 
report addressees and numbers of copies. Reporting categories shall be 
coordinated with the center financial management office to ensure that 
data required for agency cost accounting will be provided by the 
reports. Reporting dates shall be in accordance with NPG 9501.2, except 
that earlier submission is encouraged whenever feasible. No due date 
shall be permitted which is later than the date by which the center 
financial management office needs the

[[Page 310]]

data to enter an accurate monthly cost accrual in the accounting system.
    (2) The contractor shall be required to submit an initial report in 
the NF 533Q format, time phased for the expected life of the contract, 
within 30 days after authorization to proceed has been granted. NF 533M 
reporting will begin no later than 30 days after incurrence of cost. NF 
533Q reporting begins with the initial report.


<R05>
1842.7202  Contract clause.

    The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.242-73, NASA 
Contractor Financial Management Reporting, in solicitations and 
contracts when any of the NASA Form 533 series of reports is required 
from the contractor.

<R04>
             Subpart 1842.73--Audit Tracking and Resolution


<R05>
1842.7301  NASA external audit follow-up system.

    (a) This section implements OMB Circular No. A-50, NASA Management 
Instruction (NMI) 9970.1A, Audit Follow-up, and NASA Audit Follow-up 
Handbook 9970.2, which provide more detailed guidance. Recommendations 
for external audits (contracts and OMB Circulars No. A-128, Audits of 
State and Local Governments, and A-133, Audits of Institutions of Higher 
Learning and Other Non-Profit Institutions) shall be resolved by formal 
review and approval procedures analogous to those at 1815.807-71.
    (b) The external audit follow-up system tracks all contract and OMB 
Circular A-128 or A-123 audits where NASA has resolution and disposition 
authority. The objective of the tracking system is to ensure that audit 
recommendations are resolved as expeditiously as possible, but a 
maximum, within 6 months of the date of the audit report.
    (c) (1) The identification and tracking of contract audit reports 
under NASA cognizance are accomplished in cooperation with DCAA by means 
of the DCAA form, Contract Audit Follow-up Summary Sheet. The use of 
this form by DCAA and NASA is covered in Chapter 6 of the NASA Audit 
Follow-up Handbook.
    (2) Identification and tracking of A-128 and A-133 audit reports are 
accomplished in cooperation with the NASA Office of the Inspector 
General (OIG) by means of a transmittal memorandum. A transmittal 
memorandum is sent by the OIG to the procurement officer of each NASA 
field installation having an award (contract, grant, or other agreement) 
covered by the audit report. The transmittal memorandum will identify 
whether there were any audit findings.
    (d)(1) Chapter 6 of the NASA Audit Follow-up Handbook identifies 
which contract audit reports are reportable semiannually to the 
Headquarters Office of Procurement (Code HC).
    (2) Only trackable A-128 and A-133 audit reports involving the 
following shall be reported semiannually to Code HC--
    (i) A significant management control issue; or
    (ii) For an individual NASA award, either the lower of 10 percent or 
$10,000 of the costs incurred in the period covered by the audit are 
questioned; or for institution-wide issues, the lower of 10 percent or 
$10,000 of the total costs incurred involving Government funds for the 
period covered by the audit are questioned.
    (e)(1) The resolution and disposition of contract audits is covered 
by Chapter 6 of the NASA Audit Follow-up Handbook.
    (2) The resolution and disposition of A-128 and A-133 are handled as 
follows:
    (i) Audit findings pertaining to an individual NASA award are the 
responsibility of the procurement officer administering that award.
    (ii) Audit findings having an institution-wide impact are the 
responsibility of the cognizant Federal agency or the agency responsible 
for oversight. OMB's January 6, 1986, Federal Register Notice (51 FR 
552), titled ``Federal Agencies Responsible for Cost negotiation and 
Audit of State and Local Governments,'' provides cognizant agency 
assignments for OMB Circular A-128. For organizations subject to OMB 
Circular A-133, there is either a

[[Page 311]]

cognizant agency or an oversight agency. The cognizant agency is the 
Federal agency that provides the predominant amount of direct funding to 
the recipient organization unless OMB makes a specific agency cognizant, 
in which case a notice will be published in the Federal Register. To 
provide for the continuity of cognizance, the determination of the 
predominant amount of direct funding will be based on the direct Federal 
awards expended in the recipient's fiscal years ending in 1996, 2000, 
and every fifth year thereafter. If there is no cognizant Federal 
agency, there is an agency responsible for oversight. The oversight 
agency is that agency which provides the predominant amount of direct 
funding. When there is no direct funding, the Federal agency with the 
predominant indirect funding is to assume the oversight 
responsibilities. In cases where NASA is the cognizant or oversight 
Federal agency, audit resolution and disposition is the responsibility 
of the procurement officer for the field installation having the largest 
amount of direct funding, or, if there is no direct funding, the largest 
amount of indirect funding for the audited period. A copy of the 
memorandum disappointing the findings shall be provided by each field 
installation having resolution responsibility for the particular report 
to the OIG Center office within whose geographic area of responsibility 
the audited organization is located.

                      Subpart 1843.2--Change Orders


<R05>
1843.205  Contract clauses.

    As authorized in the prefaces of clauses FAR 52.243-1, Changes--
Fixed Price; FAR 52.243-2, Changes--Cost Reimbursement; FAR 52.243-3, 
Changes--Time-and-Material or Labor-Hours; and FAR 52.243-4, Changes, 
the period within which a contractor must assert its rights to an 
equitable adjustment may be varied not to exceed 60 calendar days.


<R05>
1843.205-70  NASA contract clause.

    (a) The contracting officer may insert in contracts a clause 
substantially the same as 1852.243-70, Engineering Change Proposals, 
when ECPs are expected. Paragraphs (c) and (d) of the basic clause and 
Alternate I of the clause shall be changed to reflect the specific type 
of contract. A local format may be substituted for the MIL-STD-973 
format.
    (b) If it is desirable to preclude a large number of small-dollar, 
contractor-initiated engineering changes and to reduce the 
administrative cost of reviewing them, the contracting officer shall use 
the clause with its Alternate I.
    (c) If the contract is a cost-reimbursement type, the contracting 
officer shall use the clause with its Alternate II.


<R04>
             Subpart 1843.70--Undefinitized Contract Actions


<R05>
1843.7001  Definitions.

    Undefinitized contract action (UCA) means a unilateral or bilateral 
contract modification or delivery/task order in which the final price or 
estimated cost and fee have not been negotiated and mutually agreed to 
by NASA and the contractor. (Issuance of letter contracts and their 
modifications are governed by subpart 1816.6.)


<R05>
1843.7002  Policy.

    Undefinitized contract actions shall be executed by contracting 
officers on

[[Page 312]]

an exception basis and shall be limited to the minimum urgent 
requirements. The contract file for all UCAs shall be documented to 
justify issuance and shall include a Government estimate for the changed 
requirements.


<R05>
1843.7003  Procedures.

    (a) Issuance of undefinitized contract actions with a Government 
estimated cost or price over $1,000,000 must be approved in writing by 
the Center Director. This approval authority is not delegable. Issuance 
of undefinitized contract actions with a Government estimated cost or 
price less than or equal to $1,000,000 shall also be minimized but may 
be approved on an exception basis in accordance with installation 
procedures.
    (b) (1) Undefinitized contract actions exceeding $1,000,000 approved 
by the Center Director shall be issued as bilateral agreements setting 
forth a ceiling price or ``not to exceed'' estimated cost figure for the 
changed contractual requirements. For fixed price contracts the 
negotiated price for the changed contract requirements shall not exceed 
the established ceiling price. In the case of cost type contracts any 
costs eventually negotiated for the changed requirements in excess of 
the ``not to exceed'' estimated cost figure shall be non-fee bearing. 
The ceiling price or ``not to exceed'' estimated cost figures shall be 
separately identified in the UCA instrument from the pricing structure 
of the basic contract.
    (2) The Center Director may waive the ceiling price or ``not to 
exceed'' estimated cost figure and bilateral agreement requirements 
prior to UCA issuance on the basis of urgency. This waiver authority is 
not delegable. Any waivers shall be documented in the contract file.
    (c) The changed contractual requirements set forth in the UCA shall 
be clearly defined and shall be limited to the minimum effort required 
to satisfy urgent program requirements while a cost proposal is 
prepared, analyzed and negotiated.
    (d) For undefinitized contract actions with a Government estimate 
greater than $1,000,000 and not excepted under subpart 1843.7004, a 180 
day funding profile shall be obtained from the contractor prior to 
execution of the undefinitized contract action.
    (e) Undefinitized contract actions with a Government estimated cost 
or price greater than $1,000,000 shall include a requirement that the 
change shall be separately accounted for by the contractor to the degree 
necessary to provide the contracting officer visibility into actual 
costs incurred pending definitization. The contracting officer may waive 
this requirement for individual actions if there is a documented finding 
that such accounting procedures would not be cost effective. Any such 
waiver shall not affect existing NASA Form 533 or other financial 
reporting requirements set forth in the contract.


<R05>
1843.7004  Exceptions.

    (a) Exceptions to the requirement for Center Director approval for 
issuance of undefinitized contract actions are--
    (1) Modifications to facilities contracts;
    (2) Modifications to construction contracts using Construction of 
Facilities funding;
    (3) Urgent modification resulting from Shuttle manifest changes or 
that involve immediate issues of safety or damage/loss of property;
    (4) Modifications to decrease the contract value; or
    (5) Modification to letter contracts.
    (b) The contract file for any of the modifications in paragraph (a) 
of this section shall cite the exception and include complete supporting 
rational for its applicability.


<R05>
1843.7005  Definitization.

    (a) Undefinitized contract actions should be sufficiently complete 
and detailed as to enable the contractor to begin immediate preparation 
of a cost proposal for the changed requirement. The NASA goal is to 
definitive UCAs within 180 from date of issuance.
    (b) Whenever possible, pre-change study efforts or engineering 
change proposals (ECPs) shall be utilized to negotiate and definitize 
changes prior to issuance.

<R04>
                     Subpart 1843.71--Shared Savings


<R05>
1843.7101  Shared Savings Program.

    This subpart establishes and describes the methods for implementing 
and administering a Shared Savings Program. This program provides an 
incentive for contractors to propose and implement, with NASA approval, 
significant cost reduction initiatives. NASA will benefit as the more 
efficient business practices that are implemented lead to reduced costs 
on current and follow-on contracts. In return, contractors are entitled 
to share in cost savings subject to limits established in the contract. 
The contracting officer may require the contractor to provide periodic 
reporting, or other justification, or to require other steps (e.g., cost 
segregation) to ensure projected cost savings are being realized.


<R05>
1843.7102  Solicitation provision and contract clause.

    The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.243-71, 
Shared Savings, in all solicitations and contracts expected to exceed 
$1,000,000, except those awarded under FAR part 12, NRA and AO 
procedures, or the SBIR and STTR programs.

                 Subpart 1844.2--Consent to Subcontracts


<R05>
1844.201  Consent requirements.


<R05>
1844.201-1  Fixed-price prime contracts. (NASA supplements paragraph (b))

    (b)(2) (A) In determining special surveillance consent requirements, 
the contracting officer should consider specific subcontract awards, as 
well as any individual systems, subsystems, components, technologies, 
and services that should have contracting officer consent prior to being 
subcontracted.
    (B) For each planned contract award expected to exceed $1 million in 
total estimated value (inclusive of options), the contracting officer 
should consider such factors as the following to determine whether 
certain subcontractors require special surveillance:
    (a) The degree of subcontract pricing uncertainties at the time of 
contract award;
    (b) The overall quality of the contractor's approach to pricing 
subcontractors;
    (c) The extent of competition achieved, or to be achieved, by the 
contractor in the award of subcontracts;
    (d) Technical complexity and the critically of specific supplies, 
services, and technologies on the successful performance of the 
contract; and
    (e) The potential impact of planned subcontracts on source selection 
or incentive arrangements.
    (C) The contracting officer shall document results of the review in 
the contract file. For contract modifications and change orders, the 
contracting officer shall make the determination required by paragraph 
(b)(2)(B) of this section whenever the value of any subcontract 
resulting from the change order or modification is proposed to exceed 
$100,000 or is one of the number of subcontracts with a single 
subcontractor for the same or related supplies or services that are 
expected cumulatively to exceed $100,000.

<R05>
1844.201-2  Cost reimbursement and letter prime contracts. (NASA supplements paragraph (c))

    (c)(2) The policy in 1844.201-1(b)(2) shall be followed to determine 
whether certain subcontracts require special surveillance. In addition, 
any subcontract under a cost type prime contract shall be identified for 
special surveillance if consent was not provided at the time of contract 
award and cost of pricing data would be required in accordance with FAR 
15.806-2(a) (1) or (2).

officer.


<R05>
1844.204  Contract clauses.


<R05>
1844.204-70  NASA contract clause.

    The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.244-70, 
Geographic Participation in the Aerospace Program, in all research and 
development solicitations and contracts of $500,000 or over that will be 
performed within the United States.

1844.302  Requirements.


<R05>
1844.302-70  DCMC-conducted contractor purchasing system reviews.

    For contracts within their cognizance, NASA contracting officers 
shall be aware of purchasing system approval status and should become 
actively involved with the Defense Contract Management Command (DCMC) in 
the Contractor Purchasing System Review (CPSR) process. Involvement 
should include the following:
    (a) Verifying that CPSRs are being conducted in accordance with FAR 
44.302.
    (b) Ensuring that purchasing system review specifically includes the 
business unit performing the NASA contract.
    (c) Actively participating as a team member, or arranging NASA 
representation, on DCMC CPSRs to review areas of NASA-specific interest. 
At a minimum, such participation or representation shall be arranged 
when the DCMC CPSR review involves--
    (1) Contractors with major NASA programs;
    (2) Contractors' business units where the total dollar value of NASA 
contracts is substantial; or
    (3) Any contractor system where the contracting officer has special 
concerns.
    (d) Ensuring that the selected CPSR sample to be reviewed reflects 
the level of NASA business in the contractor's purchasing organization.
    (e) Providing to the cognizant DCMC CPSR team leader any areas of 
special emphasis regarding the contractor's purchasing system to ensure 
that the review is tailored to address any NASA concerns.

1844.302-71  NASA-conducted contractor purchasing system reviews.

    If a NASA activity is the cognizant contract administration officer, 
or after coordination with the cognizant DCMC CPSR office it is 
determined that a CPSR is required but cannot be accomplished by DCMC, 
then a CPSR should be conducted by NASA personnel. The NASA CPSR team 
leader:
    (a) May use the DOD FAR Supplement, Contractor Purchasing System 
Review (CPSR) guidance, as a general guide to conducting the CPSR.
    (b) May vary the scope of review depending on the contractor and 
contracts involved.
    (c) Shall maintain close coordination with the cognizant ACO during 
CPSRs at contractors under DOD cognizance.


<R05>
1844.304  Surveillance.


<R05>
1844.304-70  Contracting officer surveillance.

    (a) In the period between complete CPSRs, NASA contracting officers

[[Page 315]]

shall maintain a sufficient level of surveillance to ensure contractor 
purchasing efforts in support of NASA contracts are accomplished in an 
appropriate manner and protect the interests of the Agency.
    (b) Surveillance shall be accomplished primarily through performance 
of subcontract consent reviews. Other methods of surveillance, including 
periodic reviews of contractor purchasing records, may also be 
conducted. Contracting officers shall document the results of 
subcontract consent reviews and periodic reviews, maintaining a record 
of contractor subcontract or purchase order award performance on NASA 
contracts. Contractor performance shall be summarized on an annual basis 
and provided to the ACO cognizant of the contractor's purchasing system. 
Annual reports should summarize the number of consent reviews and other 
reviews conducted during the year by NASA representatives, and summarize 
the types and quantity of deficiencies identified during reviews, the 
need for special reviews, and recommended areas of emphasis during 
future CPSRs.


<R05>
1844.305  Granting, withholding, or withdrawing approval.


<R05>
1844.305-70  Review of CPSR reports.

    ACO actions related to purchasing system approval have a potential 
impact on NASA contracting officer consent requirements. Accordingly, 
NASA contracting officers shall review system deficiencies documented in 
CPSR reports and when results of consent reviews and other sources 
conflict with CPSR or DOD surveillance conclusions, formally communicate 
such concerns to the ACO having cognizance of purchasing system 
approval. Significant issues or significant conflicts with DOD CPSR 
results should be formally referred to the Office of Procurement (Code 
HS).

                         Subpart 1845.1--General


<R05>
1845.102   Policy.


<R05>
1845.102-70   NASA policy.

    Government property shall not be provided to contractors unless all 
other alternatives are not feasible. The decision to provide Government 
property to contractors (whether Government-furnished or contractor-
acquired) shall be made only after careful consideration of all relevant 
factors. Among these factors are the following:
    (a) Providing Government property to contractors increases the 
Government's administrative burden and requires recordkeeping and 
personnel.
    (b) Providing property may dilute the contractor's overall 
responsibility and weaken guarantees, end-item delivery requirements, 
and other contract terms.
    (c) Providing property may make NASA responsible for delays in that 
the Agency assumes responsibility for scheduling delivery of the 
property.


<R05>
1845.102-71   Solicitation and review procedures.

    (a) Each solicitation, as applicable, shall include the following:
    (1) A list of any Government property available to be furnished, 
quantities, locations, conditions, and any related information.
    (2) A requirement that offerors identify any Government property in 
their possession proposed for use during contract performance. The 
items, quantities, locations, acquisition costs, and proposed rental 
terms must be provided, along with identification of the Government 
contract under which the property is accountable.
    (3) A requirement that requested Government provided facilities be 
described and identified by the classifications in 1845.7101-1.
    (4) A requirement that offerors provide, if applicable, the date of 
the last Government property control system review, a summary of the 
findings and recommendations, and contractor corrective actions taken.
    (b) The contracting officer shall provide a copy of the solicitation 
(or contract if no solicitation is used) to the

[[Page 317]]

center supply and equipment management officer (SEMO) for review for 
acquisitions with an estimated cost greater than $1,000,000, or for 
acquisitions over $50,000 when work is to be performed at the center, 
existing Government property is being furnished, or contract acquisition 
of Government property is required or permitted.


<R05>
1845.104  Review and correction of contractors' property control systems. (NASA supplements paragraph (a))

    (a) Property administration is normally delegated to DOD. When 
property administration is not delegated to DOD, NASA shall conduct the 
review of the contractor's property administration system in accordance 
with DOD 4161.2-M, Manual for the Performance of Contract Property 
Administration.


<R05>
1845.106  Government property clauses. (NASA supplements paragraph (b))

    (b) If NASA contemplates taking title to contractor acquired 
property under paragraph (c) of the clause at FAR 52.245-2, Government 
Property (Fixed-Price Contracts), the contracting officer shall list the 
applicable property in the contract as deliverable items.


<R05>
1845.106-70  NASA contract clauses and solicitation provision.

    (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.245-70, 
Contractor Requests for Government-Owned Equipment, in all solicitations 
and contracts that have the potential for contractor acquisition of 
equipment for the account of the Government that is not listed as a 
specific contract deliverable. See 1845.7102 for instructions on 
preparing DD Form 1419.
    (b)(1) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.245-
71, Installation-Accountable Government Property, in solicitations and 
contracts when Government property is to be made available to a 
contractor working on a NASA installation, and the Government will 
maintain accountability for the property. The contracting officer shall 
list in the clause the applicable property user responsibilities. For 
purposes of this clause, NASA installations include local off-site 
buildings owned or directly leased by NASA when the contractor does not 
have authority to acquire property for the account of the Government.
    (2) Use of this clause is subject to the SEMO's concurrence that 
adequate installation property management resources are available for 
oversight of the property in accordance with all applicable NASA 
installation property management directives.
    (3) The contracting officer shall identify in the contract the 
nature, quantity, and acquisition cost of such property and make the 
property available on a no-charge basis.
    (4) The contracting officer shall use the clause with its Alternate 
I if the SEMO requests that the contractor be restricted from use of the 
center central receiving facility for the purposes of receiving 
contractor-acquired property.
    (5) Contracting officers shall list separately in the contract any 
property provided under a FAR 52.245 Government property clause that 
remains accountable to the contractor during its use on the contract 
(such as property used at the contractor's or a subcontractor's off-site 
facility) and which is not also subject to the clause at 1852.245-71. 
The contracting officer shall address any specific maintenance 
considerations (e.g., requiring or precluding use of an installation 
calibration or repair facility) elsewhere in the contract.
    (6) See 1845.106-70(e).
    (c) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.245-72, 
Liability for Government Property Furnished for Repair and Services, in 
fixed-price solicitations and contracts (except for experimental, 
developmental, or research work with educational or nonprofit 
institutions, where no profit is contemplated) for repair, modification, 
rehabilitation, or other servicing of Government property, if such 
property is to be furnished to a contractor for that purpose and no 
other Government property is to be furnished. The contracting officer 
shall not require additional insurance under the clause unless the 
circumstances clearly indicate advantages to the Government.
    (d) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.245-73, 
Financial

[[Page 318]]

Reporting of NASA Property in the Custody of Contractors, in cost 
reimbursement contracts unless all property to be provided is subject to 
the clause at 1852.245-71, Installation-Accountable Government Property. 
The clause shall also be included in other types of contracts when it is 
known at award that property will be provided to the contractor or that 
the contractor will acquire property title to which will vest in the 
Government prior to delivery.
    (e) When approved by the Logistics Management Office of the 
Headquarters Office of Management Systems and Facilities (Code JLG), the 
contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.245-74, Contractor 
Accountable On-Site Government Property, in lieu of the clause at 
1852.245-71, in solicitations and contracts when accountability rests 
with an on-site contractor. The contracting officer's written request 
for approval shall include a determination of costs that will be (1) 
avoided (e.g., additional costs to the installation's property 
management systems and staffing) and (2) incurred (e.g., reimbursable 
costs of the contractor to implement, staff, and operate separate 
property management systems on-site, and resources needed for 
performance of, or reimbursement for, property administration) under 
contractor accountability.
    (f) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.245-75, 
Title to Equipment, in solicitations and contracts where the clause at 
FAR 52.245-2 with its Alternate II or 52.245-5, with its Alternate I is 
used.
    (g) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.245-76, 
List of Government-Furnished Property, in solicitations and contracts if 
the contractor is to be accountable under the contract for Government 
property.
    (h) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.245-77, 
List of Installation-Accountable Property and Services, in solicitations 
and contracts that require performance at the center and authorize 
contractor use of property within the physical borders of the center.
    (1) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 1852.245-
79, Use of Government-Owned Property, in all solicitations when 
Government property may be used by the contractor.
    (j) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.245-80, 
Use of Government Production and Research Property on a No-Charge Basis, 
in solicitations and contracts when government property (real property, 
commercially available equipment, special test equipment, or special 
tooling) accountable under another contract(s) is authorized for use.


<R05>
1845.106-71  Plant reconversion and plant clearance.

    The Associate Administrator for Procurement (Code HS) is the 
approval authority for any solicitation provision or contract clause 
that would defer negotiation of costs for plant reconversion plant 
clearance until after award.


<R04>
      Subpart 1845.3--Providing Government Property to Contractors


<R05>
1845.301  Definitions.

    Facilities, as defined in the FAR, also include real property and 
commercially available equipment, whether owned or leased by NASA or 
reimbursed as a cost under the contract.
    Provide, as used in this subpart in such phrases as ``Government 
property provided to the contractor'' and ``Government-provided 
property,'' means either to furnish, as in ``Government-furnished 
property,'' or to permit to be acquired, as in ``contractor-acquired 
property.'' See FAR 45.101 for definitions of ``contractor-acquired 
property'' and ``Government-furnished property.''


<R05>
1845.302  Providing facilities.


<R05>
1845.302-1  Policy. (NASA supplements paragraph (a))

    (a) In addition to the exceptions listed in FAR 45.302-1(a), 
existing NASA-owned facilities (whether contractor acquired or 
government furnished) being used by a contractor may be retained for the 
remainder of the contract period and furnished under any follow-on 
contract for the same effort if the contracting officer determines

[[Page 319]]

that to do so would be in the best interest of the Government, provided 
that:
    (i) The facilities are required to accomplish the purpose of the 
contract;
    (ii) The contract contains a provision requiring the contractor to 
replace any of the facilities that reach the end of their useful life 
during the contract period, or which are beyond economical repair, if 
the facilities are still needed for contract performance. Such 
replacements shall be made with contractor-owned facilities. The 
contract provision shall also expressly prohibit contractor acquisitions 
of facility items for the Government, unless specifically authorized by 
the contract or consent has been obtained in writing from the 
contracting officer pursuant to FAR 45.302-1(a);
    (iii) Consideration has been given to any alternative uses by 
Government personnel within the agency, in consultation with the center 
industrial property officer; and
    (iv) The contracting officer documents the file with a detailed 
explanation of why continued furnishing of the facilities is in the best 
interest of the Government.
    (a)(4)(A) The procurement officer is designated to make the 
determinations and findings (D&F) authorizing the use of Government 
facilities. See 1845.302-71 for D&F format.
    (B) The requirements for a D&F and a prospective contractor's 
written statement asserting inability to obtain facilities are not 
applicable in the circumstances listed under FAR 45.302-1(d). In these 
cases, the contracting officer shall document the contract file with the 
rationale for providing the facilities, including the reason for not 
requiring the contractor to provide them.


<R05>
1845.302-2  Facilities contracts.

    Unless termination would be detrimental to the Government's 
interests, contracting officers shall terminate facilities contracts 
when the Government property is no longer required for the performance 
of Government contracts or subcontracts. Contracting officers shall not 
grant the contractor the unilateral right to extend the time during 
which it is entitled to use the property provided under the facilities 
contract.


<R05>
1845.302-70  Securing approval of facilities projects.

    (a) Pursuant to NMI 7330.1, Delegation of Authority--Approval 
Authorities for Facility Projects, the contracting officer must approve 
facilities projects involving leasing, construction, expansion, 
modification, rehabilitation, repair, or replacement of real property.
    (b) The contracting officer's written authorization is required 
before any change is made in the scope or estimated cost of any 
facilities project.


<R05>
1845.302-71  Determination and findings.

    (a) Procedure. Determination and findings (D&F) required under FAR 
45.302-1(a)(4) and 1845.302-1(a)(4) shall be prepared by the contracting 
officer and approved by the procurement officer. Prior to approval, 
concurrence must be obtained from the SEMO to ensure agreement on the 
use of the government facilities by the contractor. D&Fs shall address 
individual types of facilities to be provided to the contractor. 
Reference to specific variations in quantities of items to be provided 
should be included in the D&F if additional requirements are 
anticipated. A separate D&F is required before adding new types of items 
or significant changes in quantity or before adding any new work to the 
contract that requires additional Government facilities.
    (b) Format. A sample format follows:

   National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, DC 20546

                       Determination and Findings

                Decision To Provide Government Facilities

    On the basis of the following findings and determinations, 
Government-owned facilities may be provided to [insert the name of the 
contractor] pursuant to the authority of FAR 45.302-1(a)(4).

                                Findings

    1. The [insert the name of the contracting activity] and the 
contractor (have entered)/(proposed to enter) into Contract No. [Insert 
the contract number]. (Include the following information: Type of 
contract, contract

[[Page 320]]

value, and a brief description of the scope of work performed under the 
contract.)
    2. (Justify that Government facilities are needed for performance 
under the contract. The justification shall demonstrate either (i) that 
the contract cannot be fulfilled by any other means, or (ii) that it is 
in the public interest to provide the facilities. It is imperative that 
the justification be fully substantiated by evidence.)
    3. (If the contract effort cannot be fulfilled by any other means, 
indicate why the contractor cannot provide the facilities. For example, 
due to financial constraints, the contractor will replace the Government 
facilities with contractor-owned facilities. Address leadtime, validate 
the contractor's claims, and state that private financing was sought and 
either not available or not advantageous to the Government. If private 
financing was not advantageous to the Government, provide justification. 
Indicate other alternatives considered and reasons for rejection.)
    4. (Describe the types of facilities to be provided and any 
variation in quantities of items based on functional requirements. 
Explain how these facilities pertain to the scope of work to be 
completed. State that the contract cannot be accomplished without the 
specified facility items being provided. Include an estimate of the 
value of the facilities and a statement that no facilities items under 
$10,000 unit cost will be provided unless the contractor is a nonprofit, 
on-site, or the facilities are only available from the Government.
    5. (Indicate whether the property will be accountable under this 
contract or a separate facilities contract.)

                              Determination

    For the reasons set forth above, it is hereby determined that the 
Government-owned facilities identified herein will be provided to the 
contractor.

    Subpart 1845.4--Contractor Use and Rental of Government Property


<R05>
1845.402  Authorizing use of Government production and research property. (NASA supplements paragraph (a))

    (a)(i) A NASA contracting officer desiring to authorize use of 
Government property under the cognizance of another contracting officer 
shall obtain that contracting officer's concurrence.
    (ii) NASA contracting officers having cognizance over NASA property 
may authorize its use on contracts of other agencies if such use will 
not interfere with NASA's primary purpose for the property and will not 
extend beyond the expected expiration or completion date of the NASA 
contract.


<R05>
1845.403  Rental--Use and Charges clause. (NASA supplements paragraph (a))

    (a) The Center Director is designated as the authority to make the 
determinations on modified rental rates.


<R05>
1845.405  Contracts with foreign governments or international organizations.


<R05>
1845.405-70  NASA procedures.

    (a) NASA policy is to recover a fair share of the cost of Government 
production and research property if such property is used in performing 
services or manufacturing articles for foreign countries or for 
international organizations.
    (b) The prior written approval of the Associate Administrator for 
Procurement (Code H) is required for the use of Government production 
and research property on work for foreign countries or for international 
organizations. The Logistics Management Office of the Headquarters 
Offices of Management Systems and Facilities (Code JLG), the Office of 
General Counsel (Code G), and the International Planning and Programs 
Branch of the Headquarters Office of External Relations (Code IRD) are 
required concurrences.
    (c) Contracting officers shall forward requests for approval to Code 
HS, along with a summary of the circumstances involved, including as a 
minimum--
    (1) The name of the requesting contractor;
    (2) The number of the contract under which the equipment is 
controlled;
    (3) A description of the equipment;
    (4) The name of the foreign contractor and the relationship of the 
foreign contractor to its government or to any international 
organization;
    (5) A description of the articles to be manufactured or services to 
be performed;
    (6) A statement that the intended use will not interfere with the 
current or foreseeable requirements of the United States or require use 
of the equipment

[[Page 321]]

beyond the expected expiration or completion date of the NASA contract;
    (7) A statement that the use of Government property is consistent 
with the best interests of the United States;
    (8) A statement that such use is legally authorized; and
    (9) Any evidence of endorsement by another agency of the U.S. 
Government based on national security or foreign policy of the United 
States.
    (d) Use, if approved, shall be subject to rent in accordance with 
FAR 45.403.


<R05>
1845.407  Use of Government production and research property on independent research and development programs.


<R05>
1845.406-70  NASA policy.

    The contracting officer should not authorize contractor use of 
Government property for independent research and development on a rent-
free basis except in unusual circumstances when it has been determined 
by the contracting officer that--
    (a) Such use is clearly in the best interests of the Government (for 
example, the project can reasonably be expected to be of value in 
specific Government programs); and
    (b) No competitive advantage will accrue to the contractor through 
such use (see FAR 45.201).


<R05>
1845.406  Non-Government use of plant equipment. (NASA supplements paragraph (a)).

    For NASA, the coverage in FAR 45.407, applies to all equipment, not 
just plant equipment.
    (a)(i) The Associate Administrator for Procurement (Code HS) is the 
approval authority for non-Government use of equipment exceeding 25 
percent.
    (ii) The percentage of Government and non-Government use shall be 
computed on the basis of time available for use. For this purpose, the 
contractor's normal work schedule, as represented by scheduled 
production shift hours, shall be used. All equipment having a unit 
acquisition cost of less than $25,000 at any single location may be 
averaged over a quarterly period. Equipment having a unit acquisition 
cost of $25,000 or more shall be considered on an item-by-item basis.
    (iii) Approval for non-Government use of less than 25 percent shall 
be for a period not exceeding 1 year. Approval for non-Government use in 
excess of 25 percent shall not be for less than 3 months.
    (iv) Requests for the approval shall be submitted to Code HS at 
least 6 weeks in advance of the projected use and shall include--
    (A) The number of equipment items involved and their total

property may be routinely disposed of in

[[Page 323]]

accordance with that procedure and not processed under this section.
    (b) The center property administrator is authorized to approve the 
contractor's scrap procedure. Before approval, the plant clearance 
officer shall review the procedure, particularly regarding sales. The 
plant clearance officer shall ensure that the procedure contains 
adequate requirements for inspecting and examining items to be disposed 
of as scrap. When the contractor's procedure does not require physical 
segregation of Government-owned scrap from contractor-owned scrap and 
separate disposal, care shall be exercised to ensure that a contract 
change that generates a large quantity of property does not result in an 
inequitable return to the Government. In such a case, the property 
administrator shall make a determination as to whether separate 
disposition of Government scrap would be appropriate.
    (c) A plant clearance case shall not be established for property 
disposed of through the contractor's approved scrap procedure.
    (d) Property in scrap condition, other than that disposed of through 
the contractor's approved scrap procedure, shall be reported on

                   Subpart 1845.71--Forms Preparation


<R05>
1845.7101  Instructions for preparing NASA Form 1018.

    NASA Form 1018 (see 1853.3) provides information for NASA financial 
statements and property management. Accuracy and timeliness of the 
report are, therefore, very important. Contractors shall retain 
documents which support the data reported on NF 1018 in accordance with 
FAR subpart 4.7, Contractor Records Retention. Classifications of 
property, related costs to be reported,

[[Page 324]]

and reporting requirements are set forth in this subpart.


<R05>
1845.7101-1  Property classification.

    (a) Contractors shall report costs in the classifications required 
on NF 1018, as described in this section. For Land, Buildings, Other 
Structures and Facilities, and Leasehold Improvements, contractors shall 
report the amount for all items with a unit cost of $5,000 or more and a 
useful life of 2 years or more. For Plant Equipment, Special Tooling, 
Special Test Equipment and Agency-Peculiar Property, contractors shall 
separately report:
    (1) the amount for all items with a unit cost of $5,000 or more and 
a useful life of 2 years or more, and
    (2) all items under $5,000, regardless of useful life.
    (b) Contractors shall report the amount for all Materials, 
regardless of unit costs.
    (c) Land. Includes costs of land, improvements to land, and 
associated costs incidental to acquiring and preparing land for use. 
(for example; appraisal fees, clearing costs, drainage, grading, 
landscaping, plats and surveys, removal and relocation of the property 
of others as part of a land purchase, removal or destruction of 
structures or facilities purchased but not used, and legal expenses).
    (d) Buildings. Includes costs of buildings, improvements to 
buildings, and fixed equipment required for the operation of a building 
which is permanently attached to and a part of the building and cannot 
be removed without cutting into the walls, ceilings, or floors. Examples 
of fixed equipment required for the functioning of a building include 
plumbing, heating and lighting equipment, elevators, central air 
conditioning systems, and built-in safes and vaults.
    (e) Other structures and facilities. Includes costs of acquisitions 
and improvements of structures and facilities other than buildings; for 
example, airfield pavements, harbor and port facilities, power 
production facilities and distribution systems, reclamation and 
irrigation facilities, flood control and navigation aids, utility 
systems (heating, sewage, water and electrical) when they serve several 
buildings or structures, communication systems, traffic aids, roads and 
bridges, railroads, monuments and memorials, and nonstructural 
improvements, such as sidewalks, parking areas, and fences.
    (f) Leasehold improvements. Includes costs of improvements to leased 
buildings, structures, and facilities, as well as easements and right-
of-way, where NASA is the lessee or the cost is charged to a NASA

    (g) Equipment. Includes cost of commercially available personal 
property for use in manufacturing supplies, performing services, or any 
general or administrative purpose (for example, machine tools, 
furniture, vehicles, computers, accessory or auxiliary items, and test 
equipment).
    (h) Construction in Progress. Includes costs for work in process for 
the construction of Buildings, Other Structures and Facilities, and 
Leasehold Improvements to which NASA has title.
    (i) Special Tooling. Includes costs of equipment and manufacturing 
aids (and components and replacements of these items) that are of such a 
specialized nature that, without substantial modification or alteration, 
their use is limited to the development or production of particular 
supplies or parts, or to the performance of particular services. 
Examples include jigs, dies, fixtures, molds, patterns, taps and gauges.
    (j) Special Test Equipment. Includes costs of equipment used to 
accomplish special purpose testing in performing a contract, and items 
or assemblies of equipment.
    (k) Material. Includes costs of NASA owned property held in 
inventory that may become a part of an end item or be expended in 
performing a contract. Examples include raw and processed material, 
parts, assemblies, small tools and supplies. Does not include material 
that is part of work in process.
    (l) Agency-Peculiar Property. Includes actual or estimated costs of 
completed items, systems and subsystems, spare parts and components 
unique to NASA aeronautical and space programs. Examples include 
aircraft, engines, satellites, instruments, rockets, prototypes and

as a result of progress

[[Page 325]]

payments to fixed price subcontractors, shall be included to reflect the 
pro rata cost of undelivered agency-peculiar property.
    (m) Contract Work-in-Process. Includes the costs of all work-in-
process and excludes the costs of completed items reported in other 
categories.


<R05>
1845.7101-2  Transfers of property.

    A transfer is a change in accountability between and among prime 
contracts, centers, and other Government agencies (e.g., between 
contracts of the same installation, contracts of different installation, 
a contract of one installation to that of another installation, an 
installation to a contract of another installation, and a contract to 
another Government agency or its contract). So that NASA may properly 
control and account for transfers, they shall be adequately documented. 
Therefore, procurement, property, and financial organizations at NASA 
Centers must effect all transfers of accountability, although physical 
shipment and receipt of property may be made directly by contractors. 
The procedures described in this section shall be followed in all cases, 
to provide an administrative and audit trail, even if property is 
physically shipped directly from one contractor to another. Property 
shipped between September 1 and September 30, inclusively, shall be 
reported by the shipping contractor, regardless of the method of 
shipment, unless written evidence of receipt at destination has been 
received. Repairables provided under fixed price repair contracts that 
include the clause at 1852.245-72, Liability for Government Property 
Furnished for Repair or Other Services, remain accountable to the 
cognizant center and are not reportable on NF 1018; repairables provided 
under a cost-reimbursement contract, however, are accountable to the 
contractor and reportable on NF 1018. All materials provided or conduct 
repairs are reportable, regardless of contract type.
    (a) Approval and Notification. The contractor must obtain the 
approval of the contracting officer or designee for transfers of 
property before shipment. Each shipping document must contain contract 
numbers, shipping references, property classifications in which the 
items are recorded, unit prices, and any other appropriate identifying 
or descriptive data. Unit prices shall be obtained from records 
maintained pursuant to FAR part 45 and 1845. Shipping contractors shall 
furnish a copy of the shipping document to the cognizant property 
administrator. Shipping and receiving contractors shall promptly notify 
the financial management office of the NASA center responsible for their 
respective contracts when accountability for Government property is 
transferred to, or received from, other contracts, contractors, NASA 
centers or Government agencies. Copies of shipping or receiving 
documents will suffice as notification in most instances.
    (b) Reclassification. If property is transferred to another contract 
or contractor, the receiving contractor shall record the property in the 
same property classification and amount appearing on the shipping 
document. For example, when a contractor receives an item from another 
contractor that is identified on the shipping document as equipment, but 
that the recipient intendes to incorporate into special test equipment, 
the recipient shall first record the item in the equipment account and 
subsequently reclassify it as special test equipment. Reclassification 
of equipment, special tooling, special test equipment, or agency-
peculiar property requires prior approval of the contracting officer or 
a designee.
    (c) Incomplete documentation. If contractors receive transfer 
documents having insufficient detail to properly record the transfer 
(e.g., omission of property classification, unit prices, etc.) they 
shall request the omitted data directly from the shipping contractor or 
through the property administrator as provided in FAR 45.505-2.


<R05>
1845.7101-3  Computing costs of fabricated special tooling, special test equipment, agency-peculiar property and contract work in process

    (a) Costs of fabricated special tooling, special test equipment, 
agency-peculiar property and contract work in process shall be computed 
in accordance with accepted accounting principles, be reasonably 
accurate, and be

[[Page 326]]

the product of any one or a combination of, the following:
    (1) Abstracts of cost data from contractor property or financial 
records.
    (2) Computations based on engineering and financial data.
    (3) Estimates based on NASA Form 533 reports.
    (4) Formula procedures (e.g., using a 50 percent factor for work in 
process items, on the basis of updated Standard Form 1411 estimates or 
the contractor's approved estimating and pricing system).
    (5) Other approved methods.
    (b) Contractors shall report costs using records that are part of 
the prescribed property or financial control system as provided in this 
section. Fabrication costs shall be based on approved systems or 
procedures and shall include all direct and indirect costs of 
fabricating Government property.
    (c) The contractor shall redetermine the costs of items returned for 
modification or rehabilitation.
    (d) The computation of work in process shall include the costs of 
associated systems, subsystems, and spare parts and components furnished 
or acquired and charged to work in process pending incorporation into a 
finished item. These types of items make up what is sometimes called 
production inventory and include programmed extra units to cover 
replacement during the fabrication process (production spares). Also 
included are deliverable items on which the contractor or a 
subcontractor has begun work, and materials that have been issued from 
inventory.


<R05>
1845.7101-4  Type of deletions from contractor property records.

    Contractors shall report the types of deletions from contract 
property records as described in this section.
    (a) Adjusted. Changes in the deletion amounts, if any, that result 
from mathematical errors in the previous report.
    (b) Lost, Damaged or Destroyed. Deletion amounts as a result of 
relief from responsibility under FAR 45.503 granted during the reporting 
period.
    (c) Transferred in Place. Deletion amounts that result from a 
transfer of property to a follow-up contract with same contractor.
    (d) Transferred to Center Accountability. Deletion amounts that 
result from transfer of accountability to the center responsible for the 
contract, whether or not the items are physically moved.
    (e) Transferred to Another NASA Center. Deletion amounts caused by 
transfer of accountability to a center other than the one responsible 
for the contract, whether or not the items are physically moved.
    (f) Transferred to Another Government Agency. Deletion amounts that 
result from transfer of property to another Government agency.
    (g) Purchased at Cost/Returned for Credit. Deletion amounts due to 
contractor purchase or retention of contractor acquired property as 
provided in FAR 45.605-1; or to contractor returns to suppliers under 
FAR 45.605-2.
    (h) Disposal Through Plant Clearance Process. Deletions other than 
transfers; e.g., donations to eligible recipients, sold at less than 
cost, or abandoned/directed destruction.


<R05>
1845.7101-5  Contractor's privileged financial and business information.

    If a transfer of property between contractors will involve 
disclosing costs of a proprietary nature, the contractor shall furnish 
unit prices only on those copies of the shipping documents that are sent 
to the shipping and receiving NASA installations. Transfer of the 
property to the receiving contractor shall be on a no-cost basis.


<R05>
1845.7102  Instructions for preparing DD Form 1419.

    (a) The contractor shall enter the essential information covering 
Sections I and II before submission of DD Form 1419, DOD Industrial 
Plant Equipment Requisition, to the Industrial Property Officer (IPO). 
The IPO shall review each submission for completeness and authenticity. 
Incomplete or invalid requests shall be returned for correction.
    (b) When a suitable item is allocated in Section IV, inspection of 
the equipment is recommended. Notification of acceptance or rejection of 
the item offered must reach NASA within 30 days after allocation. A copy 
of the DD Form 1419, or equivalent format, will serve as the clearance 
document to inspect the equipment at the storage

[[Page 327]]

site. Note acceptance or rejection of the item, without inspection or 
after inspection in Section VI. If the item is acceptable, execute 
Section VII. Cite the NASA appropriation symbol where applicable in 
Section VII.
    (c) The IPO shall assign a requisition number to each DD Form 1419, 
or equivalent format request.
    (d) Next will be a four-digit entry comprised of the last digit of 
the current calendar year and the Julian date of the year. For example, 
April 15, 1997, would be written as 7095 (April 15 being the 95th day of 
the year). The last entry will be a four-digit number from 0001 to 9999 
to sequentially number requisition forms prepared on the same date. For 
example, the ninth requisition prepared on April 15, 1997, would be 
7095-0009, preceded by the FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP Activity Address Code. When 
submitting subsequent DD Forms 1419, or equivalent format, related to 
the item requested, the IPO shall use the same requisition number and 
add the alpha code to the end of the requisition number to indicate a 
second or third action on the basic request. Alpha ``A'' would indicate 
a second request, ``B'' a third, etc. In this manner, all actions, 
correspondence, etc., relative to a given request can be identified at 
all levels of processing by the use of the requisition number.
    (e) Detailed directions for completing the DD Form 1419 follow. The 
contractor may elect to provide the required data in an equivalent 
format, which complies with these directions.

preservation of, accounting for, and control of property from its 
acquisition through disposition.


<R05>
1845.7202  General.

    This subpart describes major elements of the NASA Contract Property 
Management Program. It provides guidance to NASA installation personnel 
responsible for NASA contract property (NASA personal property in

[[Page 329]]

the possession of contractors). It applies to all NASA installation 
personnel charged with this responsibility, including industrial 
property officers and specialists, property administrators, and plant 
clearance officers. It also provides detailed procedures for property 
administration. The NASA Contract Property Management Program includes 
the following three major elements:
    (a) Performance of property administration and plant clearance by 
DOD under delegations from NASA, pursuant to 1842.101.
    (b) Performance of property administration and plant clearance by 
NASA under certain situations, pursuant to 1842.203.
    (c) Maintenance of property administration and plant clearance 
functional oversight, regardless of delegations.


<R05>
1845.7203  Delegations of property administration and plant clearance.

    When delegated to DOD, property administration and plant clearance 
are performed in accordance with DOD's regulations and procedures, as 
amended by the NASA Letter of Contract Administration Delegation, 
Special Instructions on Property Administration and Plant Clearance. 
These Special Instructions are developed by the Headquarters Office of 
Management Systems and Facilities Logistics Management Office (Code 
JLG), and are available from that office upon request. The contracting 
officer shall issue the Special Instructions with delegations whenever 
Government property will be involved. Additional or more tailored 
property instructions are not proscribed but must be coordinated with 
Code JLG before issuance.


<R05>
1845.7204  Retention of property administration and plant clearance.

    NASA may occasionally retain the property administration and plant 
clearance function, such as for contract work performed at the 
installation awarding the contract and not subject to the clause at 
1852.245-71, Installation-Accountable Government Property. In these 
cases, property administration shall be performed in accordance with 
1845.3 through 1845.6, and plant clearance shall be performed in 
accordance with FAR Subpart 45.6 and 1845.6. Under the clause at 
1852.245-71, property administration and plant clearance are neither 
delegated nor retained; they are simply not required because the 
property is treated as installation rather than contract property.


<R05>
1845.7205  Functional oversight of property administration and plant clearance.

    NASA contracting officers retain functional management 
responsibility for their contracts. Utilization of the contract 
administration services of another Government agency in no way relieves 
NASA contracting officers of their ultimate responsibility for the 
proper and effective management of contracts. The functional management 
responsibility for contract property is described in this section. 
Beyond individual contracting officers, each NASA installation has 
designated an industrial property officer to manage and coordinate 
property matters among the various contracting officers, technical 
officials, contractor officials, and delegated property administrators 
and plant clearance officers. Generally, that individual is responsible 
for the entire contract property management function outlined below; the 
installation is responsible for the entire function regardless of how it 
is organized and distributed. The responsibilities are:
    (a) Provide a focal point for all management of contract property, 
including Government property (Government-furnished and contractor-
acquired) provided to universities as well as to industry.
    (b) Provide guidance to contracting and other personnel on the NASA 
property provisions.
    (c) To the extent feasible, review property provisions of 
acquisition plans, solicitations, contracts, and modifications for 
potential problems. Propose changes as necessary.
    (d) To the extent feasible, participate in pre-award surveys/post-
award orientations when significant amounts of Government property will 
be involved.
    (e) Ensure that vesting-of-title determinations are made and 
documented pursuant to FAR 35.014(b).

[[Page 330]]

    (f) Maintain effective communications with delegated property 
administrators and plant clearance officers to keep fully informed about 
contractor performance and progress on any property control problems.
    (1) Obtain and review property control system survey summaries for 
all contracts for which property administration has been delegated. 
Advise Code JLG of any severe or continuing problems.
    (2) Provide property administrators copies of all pertinent contract 
property documentation.
    (g) Review and analyze NASA Form 1018, NASA Property in the Custody 
of Contractors.
    (h) Negotiate, or ensure the negotiation of, facilities contracts 
when required by FAR 45.302 and 1845.302. Advise Code JLG annually of 
new and completed facilities contracts.
    (i) Review property administrators' approvals of relief of 
responsibility for lost, damaged, and destroyed property and question 
any excessive or repetitive approvals.
    (j) When appropriate, make recommendations to source and performance 
evaluation boards regarding property management and award fee criteria 
and evaluations regarding property management.
    (k) Monitor plant clearance status to preclude delays in contract 
closeout.
    (l) Maintain contract property files for all transactions and 
correspondence associated with each contract. Upon receipt of Standard 
Form 1424, Inventory Disposal Report, and DD Form 1593, Contract 
Administration Completion Record, or equivalents, merge all property 
records for the contract and forward for inclusion with the official 
completed file.
    (m) Perform on-site property administration and plant clearance when 
they are not delegated to DOD and the property is not subject to the 
clause at 1852.245-71.


<R05>
1845.7206  Responsibilities of property administrators and plant clearance officers.


<R05>
1845.7206-1  Property administrators.

    (a) When property administration is not delegated to DOD, the 
property administrator shall evaluate the contractor's management and 
control of Government property and ascertain whether the contractor is 
effectively complying with the contract provisions. The property 
administrator's responsibilities include--
    (1) Developing and applying a system survey program for each 
contractor under the property administrator's cognizance;
    (2) Evaluating the contractor's property control system and 
approving or recommending disapproval;
    (3) Advising the contracting officer of any (i) contractor 
noncompliance with approved procedures and (ii) other significant 
problems the property administrator cannot resolve, and recommending 
appropriate action, which may include disapproval of the contractor's 
property control system;
    (4) Resolving property administration matters as necessary with the 
contractor's management, personnel from Government procurement and 
logistics activities, and representatives of the NASA Headquarters 
Office of the Inspector General, the Defense Contract Audit Agency 
(DCAA), and other Government agencies; and
    (5) Recognizing the functions of other Government personnel having 
cognizance of Government property and obtaining their assistance when 
required. (These functions include, but are not limited to, contract 
audit, quality assurance, engineering, pricing, and other technical 
areas. Assistance and advice on matters involving analyses of the 
contractor's books and accounting records and on any other audit matters 
deemed appropriate shall be obtained from the cognizant auditor.)
    (b) The participation of property administrators (or other 
Government industrial property personnel) in pre-award surveys/post-
award orientations is required whenever significant amounts of 
Government property will be involved, in order to reveal and resolve 
property management problems early in the acquisition cycle.


<R05>
1845.7206-2  Plant clearance officers.

    When plant clearance is not delegated to DOD, NASA plant clearance 
officers shall be responsible for--

[[Page 331]]

    (a) Providing the contractor with instructions and advice regarding 
the proper preparation of inventory schedules;
    (b) Accepting or rejecting inventory schedules;
    (c) Conducting or arranging for inventory verification;
    (d) Initiating prescribed screening and effecting resulting actions;
    (e) Final plant clearance of contractor inventory;
    (f) Pre-inventory scrap determinations, as appropriate;
    (g) Evaluating the adequacy of the contractor's procedures for 
property disposal;
    (h) Determining the method of disposal;
    (i) Surveillance of any contractor-conducted sales;
    (j) Accounting for all contractor inventory reported by the 
contractor;
    (k) Advising and assisting, as appropriate, the contractor, the 
Supply and Equipment Management Officer (SEMO) and other Federal 
agencies in all actions relating to the proper and timely disposal of 
contractor inventory;
    (l) Approving the method of sale, evaluating bids, and approving 
sale prices for any contractor-conducted sales;
    (m) Recommending the reasonableness of selling expenses related to 
any contractor-conducted sales;
    (n) Securing antitrust clearance, as required; and
    (o) Advising the contracting officer on all property disposal 
matters.


<R05>
1845.7207  Declaration of excess property.

    A problem often disclosed by system analysis is the failure of a 
contractor to report Government property not needed in performance of 
the contract (excess). The property administrator shall fully document 
and report any such finding to the administrative contracting officer. 
After a report of excess received from a contractor has been referred to 
the plant clearance officer for screening and ultimate disposition, the 
property administrator shall ensure prompt disposition. For centrally 
reportable plant equipment, the property administrator shall--
    (a) Assure the preparation and submission of individual reports 
required of the contractor;
    (b) Verify the permit certifications required by the forms; and
    (c) Transmit the report to the NASA Industrial Property Officer.


<R05>
1845.7208  Closure of contracts.


<R05>
1845.7208-1  Completion or termination.

    Upon completion or termination of a contract, the property 
administrator shall--
    (a) Monitor the actions of the contractor in returning excess 
Government property not referred to the plant clearance officer; and
    (b) Advise the cognizant plant clearance officer as to the existence 
at a contractor's plant of residual property requiring disposal.


<R05>
1845.7208-2  Final review and closing of contracts.

    (a) When informed that disposition of Government property under a 
contract has been completed, the property administrator shall perform a 
final review and sign a determination that--
    (1) Disposition of Government property has been properly 
accomplished and documented;
    (2) Adjustment documents, including any request of the contractor 
for relief from responsibility, have been processed to completion;
    (3) Proceeds from disposals or other property transactions, 
including adjustments, have been properly credited to the contract or 
paid to the Government as directed by the contracting officer;
    (4) All questions regarding title to property fabricated or acquired 
under the contract have been resolved and appropriately documented; and
    (5) The contract property control record file is complete and ready 
for retirement.
    (b) When final review pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section 
reveals that such action is proper, the property administrator shall 
accomplish and sign a DD Form 1593, Contract Administration Completion 
Record, or equivalent.
    (c) The executed DD Form 1593 shall be forwarded to the contracting 
officer,

[[Page 332]]

the Property Summary Data Record shall be so annotated, and the 
contracting officer shall include it in the contract file.


<R05>
1845.7209  Special subjects.


<R05>
1845.7209-1  Government property at alternate locations of the prime contractor and subcontractor plants.

    (a) Government property provided to a prime contractor may be 
located at other plants of the prime contractor or at subcontractor 
locations. The prime contractor is accountable and responsible to the 
Government for this property.
    (b) A Government property administrator cognizant of the location of 
the property shall normally be designated to (1) perform required 
surveys of the property control system and (2) exercise surveillance 
over the property as a supporting responsibility.
    (c) If the property administrator determines that supporting 
property administration is required, he or she shall write the cognizant 
contract administration office asking that a property administrator be 
assigned. The request for supporting property administration shall 
include--
    (1) The name and address of the prime contractor;
    (2) The prime contract number;
    (3) The name and address of the alternate location of the prime 
contractor, or of the subcontractor where the property will be located;
    (4) A listing of the property being furnished, or, if property is 
being acquired locally, a statement to this effect; and
    (5) A copy of the subcontract or other document under which the 
property will be furnished or acquired.
    (d) Concurrent with the action cited in paragraph (c) of this 
section, the property administrator shall ascertain whether the prime 
contractor will perform the necessary reviews and surveillance with the 
contractor's own personnel, or elect to rely upon the system approval 
and continuing surveillance by a supporting property administrator of 
the property control system at the alternate location or subcontractor 
plant. If the prime contractor advises that it will accept the findings 
of a supporting property administrator, a statement in writing to that 
effect shall be obtained. If the prime contractor does not so elect, it 
will be required to perform the requisite reviews and surveillance and 
document its actions and findings.
    (e) If a single item or limited quantities of property will be 
located at an alternate location or subcontractor plant, the property 
administrator may determine that supporting property administration is 
unnecessary, provided--
    (1) The prime contractor's records adequately reflect the location 
and use of the property;
    (2) The nature of the property is such that the possibility of its 
use for unauthorized purposes is unlikely; and
    (3) The nature of the property is such that a program of preventive 
maintenance is not required.
    (f) When supporting property administration will not be requested, 
the services of a property administrator in the contract administration 
office cognizant of the site where the property is located may be 
requested on an occasional basis of special reviews or such other 
support as may be necessary. Repeated requests for assistance indicate a 
requirement for requesting supporting property administration.


<R05>
1845.7209-2  Loss, damage, or destruction of Government property.

    (a) Normally, contract provisions provide for assumption of risk of 
loss, damage, or destruction of Government property as described by the 
following:
    (1) Sealed-bid and certain negotiated fixed-price contracts provide 
that the contractor assumes the risk for all Government property 
provided under the contract (see the clause at FAR 52.245-2, Government 
Property (Fixed-Price Contracts)).
    (2) Other negotiated fixed-price contracts provide that the 
contractor assumes the risk for all Government property provided under 
the contract, with the exceptions set forth in the clause at FAR 52.245-
2, Alternate I and Alternate II.
    (3) Cost-reimbursement contracts (see the clause at FAR 52.245-5, 
Government Property (Cost-Reimbursement, Time-and-Material, or Labor-
Hour

[[Page 333]]

Contracts)) provide that the Government assumes the risk for all 
Government property provided under the contract when there is no willful 
misconduct or lack of good faith of any of the contractor's managerial 
personnel as defined in the contract.
    (4) There are certain events for which the Government does not 
assume the risk of loss, damage, or destruction of Government property, 
such as risks the contract expressly requires the contractor to insure 
against. Therefore, before reaching a conclusion or making a 
determination, the contracting officer shall obtain property 
administrator review of the contract clause and shall obtain advice from 
appropriate legal counsel on questions of legal meaning or intent.
    (5) ``Willful misconduct'' may involve any intentional or deliberate 
act or failure to act causing, or resulting in, loss, damage, or 
destruction of Government property.
    (6) ``Lack of good faith'' may involve gross neglect or disregard of 
the terms of the contract or of appropriate directions of the 
contracting officer or the contracting officer's authorized 
representatives. Examples of lack of good faith may be demonstrated by 
the failure of the contractor's managerial personnel to establish and 
maintain proper training and supervision of employees and proper 
application of controls in compliance with instructions issued by 
authorized Government personnel.
    (b) If part of the contractor's system is found to be 
unsatisfactory, the property administrator shall increase surveillance 
of that part to prevent, to the extent possible, any loss, damage, or 
destruction of Government property. The property administrator shall 
give special attention to reasonably ensuring that any loss, damage, or 
destruction occurring during a period when a contractor's system is not 
approved is identified before approval or reinstatement of approval.


<R05>
1845.7209-3  Loss, damage, or destruction of Government property while in contractor's possession or control.

    (a) The property administrator shall require the contractor to 
report any loss, damage, or destruction of Government property in its 
possession or control (including property in the possession or control 
of subcontractors) as soon as it becomes known.
    (b) When physical inventories, consumption analyses, or other 
actions disclose consumption of Government property considered 
unreasonable by the property administrator or loss, damage, or 
destruction of Government property not reported by the contractor, the 
property administrator shall prepare a statement of the items and amount 
involved. This statement shall be furnished to the contractor for 
investigation and submission of a written report to the property 
administrator relative to the incidents reported.
    (c) The contractor's reports referenced in paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section shall contain factual data as to the circumstances 
surrounding the loss, damage, destruction, or excessive consumption, 
including--
    (1) The contractor's name and the contract number;
    (2) A description of items lost, damaged, destroyed, or unreasonably 
consumed;
    (3) The cost of property lost, damaged, destroyed, or unreasonably 
consumed and cost of repairs in instances of damage (in event actual 
cost is not known, use a reasonable estimate);
    (4) The date, time (if pertinent), and cause or origin of the loss, 
damage, destruction, or consumption;
    (5) Known interests in any commingled property of which the 
Government property lost, damaged, destroyed, or unreasonably consumed 
is (or was) a part;
    (6) Insurance, if any, covering the Government property or any part 
or interest in any commingled property;
    (7) Actions taken by the contractor to prevent further loss, damage, 
destruction, or unreasonable consumption and to prevent repetition of 
similar incidents; and
    (8) Other facts or circumstances relevant to determining liability 
and responsibility for repair or replacement.
    (d) The property administrator shall investigate the incident to the 
degree required to reach a valid and supportable conclusion as to the 
contractor's

[[Page 334]]

liability for the loss, damage, destruction, or unreasonable consumption 
under the terms of the contract, and the course of action required to 
conclude the adjustment action. When required, the assistance of the 
quality assurance representative, industrial specialist, insurance 
officer, legal counsel, or other technician will be secured. When the 
contractor acknowledges liability, the property administrator shall 
forward a copy of the credit memorandum or other adjusting document to 
the administrative contracting officer and auditor, if appropriate, to 
assure proper credit. If analysis of contract provisions and 
circumstances establishes that the loss, damage, destruction, or 
consumption constitutes a risk assumed by the Government, the property 
administrator shall so advise the contractor in writing, thereby 
relieving the contractor of responsibility for the property. A copy of 
the documentation and notification to the contractor shall be retained 
in the Contract Property Control Data File for the contract.
    (e)(1) If the property administrator concludes that the contractor 
is liable for the loss, damage, destruction, or unreasonable consumption 
of Government property, he or she shall forward the complete file with 
conclusions and recommendations to the contracting officer for review 
and determination. The file shall contain--
    (i) A statement of facts as supported by investigation;
    (ii) Recommendations as to the contractor's liability and its 
amount;
    (iii) Recommendations as to action to be taken with regard to third 
party liability, if appropriate;
    (iv) Requirements for disposition, repair, or replacement of damaged 
property; and
    (v) Other pertinent comments.
    (2) A copy of the contracting officer's determination shall be 
furnished to the contractor and the property administrator, and a copy 
shall be retained in the contracting officer's files. The property 
administrator's copy shall be filed in the Contract Property Control 
Data File for the contract when all pertinent actions, such as 
compensation to the Government or repair or replacement of the property, 
have been completed.


<R05>
1845.7209-4  Financial reports.

    The property administrator is responsible for obtaining financial 
reports as prescribed in 1845.505-14 for all assigned contracts. Reports 
shall be accumulated, reviewed and distributed as required. Contractors 
are required to submit separate reports on each contract that contains 
the property reporting clause (see 1852.245-73) except as noted in 
1845.7101-4(c).


<R05>
1845.7210  Contractor utilization of Government property.


<R05>
1845.7210-1  Utilization surveys.

    (a) The property administrator is responsible for ensuring that the 
contractor has effective procedures for evaluating Government property 
utilization. However, when necessary, the contract administration office 
shall provide specialists qualified to perform the technical portion of 
utilization surveys to assist the property administrator in determining 
the adequacy of these procedures.
    (b) Upon assignment of an initial contract under which Government-
owned plant equipment in particular will be provided to a contractor, 
the property administrator shall ensure that the contractor has 
established effective procedures and techniques for controlling its 
utilization. The property administrator, with the assistance of 
technical specialists, if necessary, shall evaluate these procedures. A 
record of the evaluation shall be prepared and become a part of the 
property administration file. If the procedures are determined 
inadequate, the record shall identify the deficiencies and the 
corrective actions necessary. If the deficiencies are not corrected by 
the contractor, the property administrator shall promptly refer the 
matter to the contracting officer.
    (c) The property administrator shall perform annual surveys of the 
contractor's procedures related to utilization of Government-owned plant 
equipment. At contractor facilities having a substantial quantity of 
plant equipment, the surveys should normally be conducted on a continual 
basis, reviewing

[[Page 335]]

equipment utilization records and physically observing a group of 
preselected items during each portion of the survey. Surveys shall be 
conducted to the degree determined necessary, considering the findings 
of prior surveys and the contractor's performance history in identifying 
and declaring equipment excess to authorized requirements. The 
contractor shall be required to justify, by specific Government 
programs, the retention of all Government-owned plant equipment. The 
property administrator shall make maximum use of contractor's machine 
loading data, order boards, production planning records, machine time 
records, and other production control methods.
    (d) The property administrator shall conduct a special survey when a 
significant change occurs in the contractor's production schedules, such 
as a termination, completion of a contract, or a major adjustment in a 
program. Special surveys may be limited to a given department, activity, 
or division of a contractor's operation.
    (e) In the absence of adequate justification for retention, the 
contractor shall identify and report Government-owned plant equipment in 
accordance with FAR 45.502(g) and 45.509-2(b)(4). Items that are part of 
approved inactive package plants or standby lines are exempted from 
utilization surveys. The contracting officer shall ascertain 
periodically whether existing authorizations for standby or lay-away 
requirements are current.


<R05>
1845.7210-2  Records of surveys.

    The property administrator shall prepare a record incorporating 
written findings, conclusions, and recommendations at the conclusion of 
each survey. If appropriate, the property administrator's record may be 
limited to a statement expressing concurrence with the reports of other 
specialists. The property administrator shall retain one copy of each 
record in the property administration file.

       Subpart 1846.6--Material Inspection and Receiving Reports.


<R05>
1846.670  Introduction.


<R05>
1846.670-1  General.

    (a) This Subpart contains procedures and instructions for use of the 
Material Inspection and Receiving Report (MIRR) (DD Form 250 series) and 
commercial shipping/packing lists used to evidence Government contract 
quality assurance (CQA).
    (b) MIRRs are used to document CQA, acceptance of supplies and 
services, and shipments. MIRRs are not used for--
    (1) Shipments by subcontractors not made to the Government;
    (2) Shipment of contractor inventory (see FAR 45.601); or
    (3) Movement of Government property unless for original acquisition.


<R05>
1846.670-2  Applicability.

    (a) This subpart applies to all deliveries of supplies or services 
acquired by or for NASA except:
    (1) Acquisitions under FAR part 13;
    (2) Negotiated subsistence acquisitions; or
    (3) Contracts for which the end item is a technical or scientific 
report.
    (b) The DD Form 250 may be used for imprest fund purchases, purchase 
orders, delivery orders placed against Federal Supply Schedule 
contracts, delivery orders placed against indefinite-delivery contracts, 
or delivery orders placed against blanket purchase agreements, or when 
the purchasing, requisitioning, or ordering document provides for 
inspection and/or acceptance.
    (c) When NASA provides CQA and/or acceptance services for non-NASA 
activities, the MIRR shall be prepared in accordance with the 
instructions of this subpart unless the contract specifies otherwise.


<R05>
1846.670-3  Use.

    The DD Form 250 is a multipurpose report used for--
    (a) Providing evidence of CQA at origin or destination;
    (b) Providing evidence of acceptance at origin or destination;
    (c) Packing list documentation;
    (d) Receiving;
    (e) Shipping;
    (f) Contractor invoice; and
    (g) Contractor invoice support.


<R05>
1846.670-4  Multiple shipments.

    (a) If the ``shipped to,'' ``marked for,'' ``shipped from,'' 
``CQA,'' and ``acceptance'' data are the same for more than one shipment 
made on the same day under the same contract in a single car, truck, or 
other vehicle, one MIRR shall be prepared to cover all such shipments.
    (b) If the volume of the shipments precludes the use of a single 
car, truck, or other vehicle, a separate MIRR shall be provided for each

it to the technical officer responsible for the contract with the 
following information:
    (i) Date of VECP receipt;
    (ii) Date for notifying the contractor of VECP acceptance or 
rejection;
    (iii) Notification of the potential for awarding concurrent, future, 
or collateral savings to the contractor if the VECP is accepted;
    (iv) Request for a technical evaluation, with complete rationale for 
recommended acceptance or rejection, to include if acceptance is 
recommended:
    (A) An estimate of the type of savings, Government costs, etc., that 
can be expected from its acceptance;
    (B) A procurement request setting forth the specification changes to 
be used in any contract modification accepting the VECP in whole or in 
part; and
    (C) Additional funds if acceptance of the VECP results in negative 
instant contract savings.
    (v) Technical evaluation due date.

    (a)(6) The Associate Administrator for Procurement (Code HS) is the 
approval authority for exemptions.
    (b) The contracting officer shall not insert the clause at FAR 
52.248-1, Value Engineering, either with or without its Alternates, in 
an R&D contract where the statement of work is essentially an 
incorporation by reference of the prospective contractor's proposal. If 
any other part of the statement of work in such a contract reflects a 
Government specification that might benefit from application of VE 
techniques, the contracting officer shall consider inserting the VE 
incentive clause at FAR 52.248-1 with any applicable Alternate(s), and 
establish the applicability of the clause to that part.
    (c) Except as prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section, the 
contracting officer shall insert the clause at FAR 52.248-1 with its 
Alternate I in initial production contracts for major systems, and major 
systems R&D contracts for full-scale development, unless the contracting 
officer determines in writing that its use is inappropriate. Use of 
Alternate I is appropriate for an R&D major systems contract only if the 
contract specifications contain detailed requirements that lend 
themselves to VE.
    (d) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at FAR 52.248-1 
with its Alternate II under the conditions prescribed in paragraph (c) 
of this section

1852.000  Scope of part.

    This part, in conjunction with FAR Part 52--
    (a) Sets forth the provisions and clauses prescribed in the NFS,
    (b) Gives instructions for their use, and
    (c) Presents a matrix listing the provisions and clauses applicable 
to each principal contract type and/or purpose (e.g., fixed-price 
supply, cost-reimbursement research and development).

<R04>
     Subpart 1852.1--Instructions for Using Provisions and Contracts

    Source: 61 FR 40547, Aug. 5, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
1852.101  Using FAR part 52. (NASA supplements paragraphs (b) and (e))

    (b)(2)(i)(B) NASA contracting offices prescribing or developing 
clauses shall ensure that the requirements of subpart 1801.3 are met.
    (e)(1) The NFS matrix in subpart 1852.3 is formatted similarly to 
that in the FAR. The first page of the NFS matrix contains a key to 
column headings, a dollar threshold chart, and requirement symbols. To 
fully determine the applicability of a provision or clause in the 
``required-when-applicable'' and ``optional'' categories, Contracting 
Officers shall refer to the NFS text (cited in the matrix) that 
prescribes its use.

[[Page 353]]

    (4) The NFS matrix may be reproduced by field installations for the 
purpose of supplementing it with installation-developed provisions and 
clauses.


<R05>
1852.103  Identification of provisions and clauses. (NASA supplements paragraphs (b) and (c))

    (b) Provisions and clauses prescribed by a field installation to 
satisfy its needs shall be identified as stated in paragraphs (b) (i) 
and (ii) of this section. Articles, formats, and similar language shall 
be treated as provisions and clauses for purposes of this section 
1852.103.
    (i) A provision or clause shall be numbered using a prefix, a base, 
and a suffix. The prefix shall be an alphabetical abbreviation of the 
installation name (e.g., ARC, DFRC, GSFC, CW, JSC, KSC, LARC, LERC, 
MSFC, SSC, or SSPO). The base shall be a numeric value beginning with 
``52.2,'' with the next two digits corresponding to the number of the 
FAR or NFS subject part to which the provision or clause relates. The 
suffix shall be a hyphen and sequential number assigned within each 
part. NASA installations shall use suffix numbers from -90 to -199. For 
example, the first Johnson Space Center (JSC) provision or clause 
relating to part 36 of the FAR or NFS shall be JSC 52.236-90, the second 
JSC 52.236-91, and so forth. Provisions and clauses shall be dated in 
accordance with FAR 52.101(f).
    (ii) Contracting officers shall identify provisions and clauses as 
in the following examples:
    (A) I.2 BID ENVELOPES (GSFC 52.214-90) (AUGUST 1987) This example is 
applicable when identifying the title of provisions and clauses in 
solicitations and contracts using the uniform contract format (UCF). The 
first number (``I.2'') designates the UCF section and the sequential 
clause within that section ``GSFC 52.214-90'' specifies the clause 
number.
    (B) GSFC 52.214-90--Bid Envelopes (AUGUST 1987) This example is 
applicable in all instances in which the provision or clause citation is 
not associated with the UCF number.
    (C) Contracting officers shall not number provisions and clauses 
developed for individual acquisitions only. For example, ``F.3 Delivery 
Procedures for Special Hardware'' cites the third clause in Section F of 
a contract using the UCF, but has no clause number or date identified 
with it, indicating that the clause was developed for the particular 
contract it appears in.


<R05>
1852.103-70  Identification of modified provisions and clauses.

    When a FAR clause or provision is included in a solicitation or 
contract and the NFS prescribes a modification, the title line shall 
identify the modification as shown in this subsection. This format shall 
be used both for incorporation by reference and when using full text.

    ``52.232-28 Electronic Funds Transfer Payment Methods (APR 1989)--as 
modified by NASA FAR Supplement 1832.908(a)''


<R05>
1852.104  Procedures for modifying and completing provisions and clauses.

    NFS provisions and clauses shall not be modified unless authorized 
by the NFS. When authorized, contracting officers must comply with the 
procedures in FAR 52.104.

1852.204-76  Security requirements for unclassified automated information resources.

    As prescribed in 1804.470-4, insert the following clause:

 Security Requirements for Unclassified Automated Information Resources 
                               (Sep 1993)

    (a) In addition to complying with any functional and technical 
security requirements set forth in the schedule and the clauses of this 
contract, the Contractor shall initiate personnel screening checks and 
obtain user responsibility agreements, as required by this clause, for 
each contractor employee requiring unescorted or unsupervised physical 
access or electronic access to the following limited or controlled 
areas, systems, programs and data: [List areas, systems, programs and 
data].
    (1) The Contractor shall submit a personnel security questionnaire 
(NASA Form 531, Name Check Request, for National Agency Check (NAC) 
investigations and Standard Form 85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust 
Positions, for specified sensitive positions) and a Fingerprint Card 
(FD-258 with NASA overprint in Origin Block) to the installation 
Security Officer for each Contractor employee who requires access. The 
required forms may be obtained from the installation security office. 
Employees may have fingerprints taken at the [Insert office name and 
location], or at any police department.
    (i) Several months may be required for completion of complex 
personnel screening investigations. Background screening may not be 
required for employees with recent or current Federal Government 
investigations.
    (ii) When employee access is necessary prior to completion of 
personnel screening, each contractor employee requiring access may be 
considered for escorted access. The installation Security Officer will 
establish the eligibility of proposed escorts.
    (2) The Contractor shall ensure that each contractor employee 
requiring access executes any user responsibility agreements required by 
the Government prior to access. The Contractor shall provide signed 
copies of the agreements to the installation Security Officer for 
inclusion in the employee's security file. Unauthorized access is a 
violation of law and punishable under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 1029, 
18 U.S.C. 1030 and other applicable statutes.
    (3) The Contractor shall notify the installation AIS Manager no 
later than the end of the day of the termination for cause of an 
authorized employee's access. The Contractor shall notify the COTR no 
later than ten days after an authorized employee no longer requires 
access for any other type of termination. Verbal notifications shall be 
confirmed in writing within thirty days.
    (b) The Contractor shall incorporate this clause in all subcontracts 
where the requirements identified in paragraph (a) are applicable to 
performance of the subcontract.

                             (End of clause)

1852.208-81  Restrictions on Printing and Duplicating.

    As prescribed in 1801.870, insert the following clause:

           Restrictions on Printing and Duplicating (Aug 1993)

    (a) The Contractor shall reproduce any documentation required by 
this contract in accordance with the provisions of the Government 
Printing and Binding Regulations, No. 26, S. Pub 101-9, U.S. Government 
Printing Office, Washington, DC, 20402, published by the Joint Committee 
on Printing, U.S. Congress.
    (b) The Contractor shall not perform, or procure from any commercial 
source, any printing in connection with the performance of work under 
this contract. The term ``printing'' includes the processes of 
composition, platemaking, presswork, silk screen processes, binding, 
microform, and the end items of such processes and equipment.
    (c) ``Duplicating/copying'' is not considered to be printing. It is 
material produced by duplicating equipment employing the lithographic 
process and automatic copy-processing or copier-duplicating machines 
employing electrostatic, thermal, or other copying processes not 
requiring the use of negatives or metal plates. The Contractor is 
authorized to duplicate production unites provided the requirement does 
not exceed 5,000 production units of any one page or 25,000 units in the 
aggregate of multiple pages. Such plates may not exceed a maximum image 
size of 10\3/4\ by 14\1/4\ inches. A ``production unit'' is one sheet, 
size 8\1/2\  x  11 inches (215  x  280 mm), one side only, and one color 
ink.
    (d) This clause does not preclude writing, editing, preparation of 
manuscript copy, or preparation of related illustrative material as a 
part of this contract, or administrative duplicating/copying (for 
example, necessary forms and instructional materials used by the 
Contractor to respond to the terms of the contract).
    (e) Costs associated with printing or duplicating/copying in excess 
of the limits set forth above are unallowable without prior written 
approval of the Contracting Officer. If the contractor has reason to 
believe that any activity required in fulfillment of the contract will 
necessitate any printing or

[[Page 355]]

substantial duplicating/copying, it immediately shall provide written 
notice to the Contracting Officer and request approval prior to 
proceeding with the activity. Requests will be processed by the 
Contracting Officer in accordance with the provisions of the Government 
Printing and Binding Regulations and NFS 1808.802.
    (f) The Contractor shall include in each subcontract which may 
involve a requirement for any printing and/or any duplicating/copying in 
excess of the limits specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, a 
provision substantially the same as this clause, including this 
paragraph (f).

the Government may terminate the contract for Default pursuant to the 
default clause of the contract.

    As prescribed in 1809.507-2, the contracting officer may insert a 
clause substantially as follows in solicitations and contracts, in 
compliance with FAR 9.507-2:

               Limitation of Future Contracting (Dec 1988)

    (a) The Contracting Officer has determined that this acquisition may 
give rise to a potential organizational conflict of interest. 
Accordingly, the attention of prospective offerors is invited to FAR 
Subpart 9.5--Organizational Conflicts of Interest.
    (b) The nature of this conflict is [describe the conflict].
    (c) The restrictions upon future contracting are as follows:
    (1) If the Contractor, under the terms of this contract, or through 
the performance of tasks pursuant to this contract, is required to 
develop specifications or statements or work that are to be incorporated 
into a solicitation, the Contractor shall be ineligible to perform the 
work described in that solicitation as a prime of first-tier 
subcontractor under an ensuing NASA contract. This restriction shall 
remain in effect for a reasonable time, as agreed to by the Contracting 
Officer and the Contractor, sufficient to avoid unfair competitive 
advantage or potential bias (this time shall in no case be less than the 
duration of the initial production contract). NASA shall not 
unilaterally require the Contractor to prepare such specifications or 
statements of work under this contract.
    (2) To the extent that the work under this contract requires access 
to proprietary, business confidential, or financial data of other 
companies, and as long as these data remain proprietary or confidential, 
the Contractor shall protect these data from unauthorized use and 
disclosure and agrees not to use them to complete with those other 
companies.

1852.210-70  Brand name or equal.

    As prescribed in 1810.011-70(a), insert the following provision:

                     Brand Name or Equal (Dec 1988)

    (a) As used in this provision, ``brand name'' means identification 
of products by make and model. The term ``bid'' means ``offer'' if this 
is a negotiated acquisition.
    (b) If items called for by this solicitation are identified in the 
Schedule by a ``brand name or equal'' description, that identification 
is intended to be descriptive, not restrictive, and is to indicate the 
quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids 
offering ``equal'' products, including products of the brand name 
manufacturer other than the one described by brand name, will be 
considered for award if the products are clearly identified in the bids 
and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient 
characteristics requirements referenced in the solicitation.

[[Page 356]]

    (c) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in the bid that it is 
offering an ``equal'' product, the bid shall be considered as offering a 
brand-name product referenced in the solicitation.
    (d)(1) If the offeror proposes to furnish an ``equal'' product, the 
brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in 
the space provided in the solicitation, or that product shall be 
otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the 
determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the 
responsibility of the Government and will be based on information 
furnished by the offeror or identified in its bid, as well as on other 
information reasonably available to the contracting activity.
    (2) Caution to Offerors: The contracting office is not responsible 
for locating or securing any information not identified in the bid and 
reasonably available to the contracting office. Accordingly, to ensure 
that sufficient information is available, the offeror must furnish as a 
part of its bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, 
drawings, or other information) necessary for the contracting office to 
(i) determine whether the product offered meets the salient 
characteristics requirements of the solicitation and (ii) establish 
exactly what the offeror proposes to furnish and what the Government 
would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information 
furnished may include specific references to information previously 
furnished or to information otherwise available to the contracting 
office.
    (3) If the offeror proposes to modify a product so as to make it 
conform to the requirements of the solicitation, it shall (i) include in 
the bid a clear description of the proposed modifications and (ii) 
clearly mark any descriptive material to show them.
    (4) If this is a sealed-bid acquisition, modifications proposed 
after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product 
referenced in the solicitation will not be considered.

    (a) As used in this provision, ``brand name'' means identification 
of products by make and model. The term ``bid'' means ``offer'' if this 
is a negotiated acquisition.
    (b) If items called for by this solicitation are identified in the 
Schedule by a ``brand name or equal'' description, that identification 
is intended to be descriptive, not restrictive, and is to indicate the 
quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids 
offering ``equal'' products, including products of the brand name 
manufacturer other than the one described by model designation, will be 
considered for award if the products are clearly identified in the bids 
and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient 
characteristics requirements referenced in the solicitation.
    (c) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in the bid that it is 
offering an ``equal'' product, the bid shall be considered as offering a 
brand-name product referenced in the solicitation.
    (d) (1) If the offeror proposes to furnish an ``equal'' product, the

otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the 
determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the 
responsibility of the Government and will be based on information 
furnished by the offeror or identified in its bid, as well as on other 
information reasonably available to the contracting activity.
    (2) CAUTION TO OFFERORS: The contracting office is not responsible 
for locating or securing any information not identified in the bid and 
reasonably available to the contracting office. Accordingly, to ensure 
that sufficient information is available, the offeror must furnish as a

                               (Dec 1988)

    Bidders are cautioned against furnishing as a part of their bids 
descriptive literature that includes language reserving to the bidder 
the right to deviate from the requirements of the invitation for bids. 
Statements that ``Data are subject to change without notice,'' ``Prices 
subject to change without notice,'' or words having a similar effect are 
examples of such reservation. The Government will reject as 
nonresponsive any bid that incorporates literature containing such 
language or any bid that must be evaluated by using literature 
containing such language. Bidders should clearly label any submissions 
of descriptive literature not intended to form a part of a bid as such 
in order to preclude any need for the Government to interpret the 
bidder's intent in submitting descriptive literature. [See FAR 14.202-

                             (November 1993)

    (a) Offerors are invited to give an oral presentation to the 
Government on the structure and general content of their proposals. 
These presentations are intended to assist Government evaluation by 
providing a ``roadmap'' to understanding proposals, i.e., an overview of 
the proposal organization and layout, and where required information and 
elements are located. Although the offeror's basic approach to 
satisfying solicitation requirements may be explained, it is to be done 
so only in general terms and only to expedite the Government's formal 
evaluation.
    (b) The Government will not engage in any discussions during the 
oral presentation, and no proposal revisions will be accepted as part of 
the presentation. The Government's evaluation of offeror proposals will 
be based on the contents of the initial proposal, and any information 
not included in the initial proposal that is provided at the oral 
presentation will not be evaluated.
    (c) Offerors should indicate in their proposals if they wish to give 
an oral presentation. These presentations are not mandatory, and 
electing not to give a presentation will not, in itself, affect proposal 
evaluation.

[[Page 360]]

    (d) Because the presentations are intended to assist the 
Government's evaluation, they will be scheduled to take place prior to 
commencement of the formal initial evaluation, normally within three 
days after proposal receipt. Offerors unable to accommodate this 
schedule forfeit their opportunity to provide a presentation.
    (e) The presentations will consist of an offeror briefing not to 
exceed [insert 1 or 2] hours to be followed by a question and answer 
period. The order of offeror presentations will be determined at random. 
The exact time and place of the presentation, along with any other 
guidance, will be provided to the offeror by the contracting officer or 
his/her representative.
    (f) Presentation materials are not required, but if used, the 
Government will retain one copy in its official file as a historical 
record of the presentation even though these materials will not be used 
in the Government's evaluation process.

cannot be made by the contracting officer, interested parties may

on each interim evaluation. The amount of the interim award fee payment 
is limited to the lesser of the interim evaluation score or 80 percent 
of the fee allocation to that period less any provisional payments made 
during the period. All interim award fee payments will be superseded by 
the final award fee determination.
    (3) Provisional award fee payments will [insert ``not'' if 
applicable] be made under this contract pending each interim evaluation. 
If applicable, provisional award fee payments will be made to the 
Contractor on a [insert the frequency of provisional payments (not more 
often than monthly)] basis. The amount of award fee which will be 
provisionally paid in each evaluation period is limited to [Insert a 
percent not to exceed 80 percent] of the prior interim evaluation score 
(see [insert applicable cite]). Provisional award fee payments made each 
evaluation period will be superseded by the interim award fee evaluation 
for that period. If provisional payments made exceed the interim 
evaluation score, the Contractor will either credit the next payment 
voucher for the amount of such overpayment or refund the difference to 
the Government, as directed by the Contracting Officer. If the 
Government determines that (i) the total amount of provisional fee 
payments will apparently substantially exceed the anticipated final 
evaluation score, or (ii) the prior interim evaluation is ``poor/
unsatisfactory,'' the Contracting Officer will direct the suspension or 
reduction of the future payments and/or request a prompt refund of 
excess payments as appropriate. Written notification of the 
determination will be provided to the Contractor with a copy to the 
Deputy Chief Financial Officer (Finance). This determination is not 
subject to the Disputes clause.
    (4) All interim (and provisional, if applicable) fee payments will 
be superseded by the fee determination made in the final award fee 
evaluation. The Government will then pay the Contractor, or the 
Contractor will refund to the Government the difference between the 
final award fee determination and the cumulative interim (and 
provisional, if applicable) fee payments. If the final award fee 
evaluation is ``poor/unsatisfactory'', any base fee paid will be 
refunded to the Government.
    (5) Payment of base fee, if applicable, will be made based on 
submission of an invoice by the Contractor. Payment of award fee will be 
made by the [insert payment office] based on [Insert method of making 
award fee payment, e.g., issuance of a unilateral modification by the 
Contracting Officer].
    (d) Award fee determinations made by the Government under this 
contract are not subject to the Disputes clause.

                             (January 1997)

    (a) A performance incentive applies to the following hardware 
item(s) delivered under this contract: (1).
    The performance incentive will measure the performance of those 
items against the salient hardware performance requirement, called 
``unit(s) of measurement,'' e.g., months in service or amount of data 
transmitted, identified below. The performance incentive becomes 
effective when the hardware is put into service. It includes a standard 
performance level, a positive incentive, and a negative incentive, which 
are described in this clause.
    (b) Standard performance level. At the standard performance level, 
the Contractor has met the contract requirement for the unit of 
measurement. Neither positive nor negative incentives apply when this 
level is achieved but not exceeded. The standard performance level for 
(1) ____ is established as follows: (2).
    (c) Positive incentive. The Contractor earns a separate positive 
incentive amount for each hardware item listed in paragraph (a) of this 
clause when the standard performance level for that item is exceeded. 
The amount earned for each item varies with the units of measurement 
achieved, up to a maximum positive performance incentive amount of $ (3) 
____ per item. The units of measurement and the incentive amounts 
associated with achieving each unit are shown below: (4).
    (d) Negative incentive. The Contractor will pay to the Government a 
negative incentive amount for each hardware item that fails to achieve 
the standard performance level. The amount to be paid for each item 
varies with the units of measurement achieved, up to the maximum 
negative incentive amount of $ (5) ____. The units of measurement and 
the incentive amounts associated with achieving each unit are shown 
below: (6).
    (e) The final calculation of positive or negative performance 
incentive amounts shall be done when performance (as defined by the unit 
of measurement) ceases or when the maximum positive incentive is 
reached.
    (1) When the Contracting Officer determines that the performance 
level achieved fell below the standard performance level, the Contractor 
will either pay the amount due the Government or credit the next payment 
voucher for the amount due, as directed by the Contracting Officer.
    (2) When the performance level exceeds the standard level, the 
Contractor may request payment of the incentive amount associated with a 
given level of performance, provided that such payments shall not be 
more frequent than monthly. When performance ceases or the maximum 
positive incentive is reached, the Government shall calculate the final 
performance incentive earned and unpaid and promptly remit it to the 
contractor.
    (f) If performance cannot be demonstrated, through no fault of the 
Contractor, within [insert number of months or years] after the date of 
hardware acceptance by the Government, the Contractor will be paid 
[insert percentage] of the maximum performance incentive.
    (g) The decisions made as to the amount(s) of positive or negative 
incentives are subject to the Disputes clause.
    (1) Insert applicable item number(s) and/or nomenclature.
    (2) Insert a specific unit of measurement for each hardware item 
listed in (1) and each salient characteristic, if more than one.

    As prescribed in 1819.7219(b), insert the following clause:

                   Mentor Requirements and Evaluation

                               (JUL 1997)

    (a) The purpose of the NASA Mentor-Protege Program is for a NASA 
prime contractor to provide developmental assistance to certain 
subcontractors qualifying as

[[Page 368]]

proteges. Eligible proteges include small disadvantaged business 
concerns, women-owned small business concerns, Historically Black 
Colleges and Universities, and minority institutions meeting the 
qualifications specified in NASA FAR Supplement (NFS) 1819.7209.
    (b) NASA will evaluate the contractor's performance through the 
Performance Evaluation process. The evaluation will consider the 
following:
    (1) Specific actions taken by the contractor, during the evaluation 
period, to increase the participation of proteges as subcontractors and 
suppliers;
    (2) Specific actions taken by the contractor during this evaluation 
period to develop the technical and corporate administrative expertise 
of a protege as defined in the agreement;
    (3) To what extent the protege has met the developmental objectives 
in the agreement; and
    (4) To what extent the firm's participation in the Mentor-Protege 
Program resulted in the protege receiving competitive contract(s) and 
subcontract(s) from private firms and agencies other than the mentor.
    (c) Semi-annual reports shall be submitted by the mentor to the NASA 
Mentor-Protege program manager, NASA Headquarters OSDBU, to include 
information as outlined in paragraph (b).
    (d) The mentor will notify the OSDBU and the contracting officer, in 
writing, as least 30 days in advance of the mentor firm's intent to 
voluntarily withdraw from the program or upon receipt of a protege's 
notice to withdraw from the Program;
    (e) Mentor and protege firms will submit a ``lessons learned'' 
evaluation to the NASA OSDBU at the conclusion of the pilot Program 
period or the conclusion of their effort whichever comes first. At the 
conclusion of each year in the Mentor-Protege Program, the mentor and 
protege, as appropriate, will formally brief the NASA Mentor-Protege 
program manager, the technical program manager, and the contracting 
officer during a formal program review regarding Program accomplishments 
as pertains to the approved agreement.
    (f) NASA may terminate mentor-protege agreements and exclude mentor 
or protege firms from participating in the NASA program if NASA 
determines that such actions are in NASA's interest. These actions shall 
be approved by the NASA OSDBU. NASA shall terminate an agreement by 
delivering to the contractor a Notice specifying the reason for 
termination and the effective date. Termination of an agreement does not 
constitute a termination of the subcontract between the mentor and the 
protege. A plan for accomplishing the subcontract effort should the 
agreement be terminated shall be submitted with the agreement as 
required in NFS 1819.7213(h).

and health measures the Contracting Officer may reasonably direct. To 
the extent that the Contractor may be entitled to an equitable 
adjustment for those measures under the terms and conditions of this 
contract, the equitable adjustment shall be determined pursuant to the 
procedures of the changes clause of this contract; provided, that no 
adjustment shall be made under this Safety and Health clause for any 
change for which an equitable adjustment is expressly provided under any 
other provision of the contract.
    (c) The Contractor shall immediately notify and promptly report to 
the Contracting Officer or a designee any accident, incident, or

substance of this clause, including this paragraph (e) and any 
applicable Schedule provisions, with appropriate changes of designations 
of the parties, in subcontracts of every tier that (1) amount to 
$1,000,000 or more (unless the Contracting Officer makes a written 
determination that this is not required), (2) require construction, 
repair, or alteration in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold, 
or (3) regardless of dollar amount, involve the use of hazardous 
materials or operations.
    (f) Authorized Government representatives of the Contracting Officer 
shall have access to and the right to examine the sites or areas where 
work under this contract is being performed in order to determine the 
adequacy of the Contractor's safety and health measures under this 
clause.
    (g) As a part of the Contractor's safety plan (and health plan, when

               Drug- and Alcohol-Free Workforce (Mar 1996)

    (a) Definitions. As used in this clause the terms ``employee,'' 
``controlled substance,'' ``employee in a sensitive position,'' and 
``use,

[[Page 370]]

in violation of applicable law or Federal regulation, of alcohol'' are 
as defined in 48 CFR 1823.570-2.
    (b) (1) The Contractor shall institute and maintain a program for 
achieving a drug- and alcohol-free workforce. As a minimum, the program 
shall provide for preemployment, reasonable suspicion, random, post-
accident, and periodic recurring (follow-up) testing of contractor 
employees in sensitive positions for use, in violation of applicable law 
or Federal regulation, of alcohol or a controlled substance. The 
Contractor may establish its testing or rehabilitation program in 
cooperation with other contractors or organizations.
    (2) This clause neither prohibits nor requires the Contractor to 
test employees in a foreign country. If the Contractor chooses to 
conduct such testing, this does not authorize the Contractor to violate 
foreign law in conducting such testing.
    (3) The Contractor's program shall test for the use of marijuana and 
cocaine. The Contractor's program may test for the use of other 
controlled substances.
    (4) The Contractor's program shall conform to the ``Mandatory 
Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs'' published by 
the Department of Health and Human Services (59 FR 29908, June 9, 1994) 
and the procedures in 49 CFR part 40, ``Procedures for Transportation 
Workplace Drug Testing Programs,'' in which references to ``DOT'' shall 
be read as ``NASA'', and the split sample method of collection shall be 
used.
    (c) (1) The Contractor's program shall provide, where appropriate, 
for the suspension, disqualification, or dismissal of any employee in a 
sensitive position in any instance where a test conducted and confirmed 
under the Contractor's program indicates that such individual has used, 
in violation of applicable law or Federal regulation, alcohol or a 
controlled substance.
    (2) The Contractor's program shall further prohibit any such 
individual from working in a sensitive position on a NASA contract, 
unless such individual has completed a program of rehabilitation 
described in paragraph (d) of this clause.
    (3) The Contractor's program shall further prohibit any such 
individual from working in any sensitive position on a NASA contract if 
the individual is determined under the Contractor's program to have 
used, in violation of applicable law or Federal regulation, alcohol or a 
controlled substance and the individual meets any of the following 
criteria:
    (i) The individual had undertaken or completed a rehabilitation 
program described in paragraph (d) of this clause prior to such use;
    (ii) Following such determination, the individual refuses to 
undertake such a rehabilitation program;
    (iii) Following such determination, the individual fails to complete 
such a rehabilitation program; or
    (iv) The individual used a controlled substance or alcohol while on 
duty.
    (d) The Contractor shall institute and maintain an appropriate 
rehabilitation program which shall, as a minimum, provide for the 
identification and opportunity for treatment of employees whose duties 
include responsibility for safety-sensitive, security, or National 
security functions who are in need of assistance in resolving problems 
with the use of alcohol or controlled substances.
    (e) The requirements of this clause shall take precedence over any 
state or local Government laws, rules, regulations, ordinances, 
standards, or orders that are inconsistent with the requirements of this 
clause.
    (f) For any collective bargaining agreement, the Contractor will 
negotiate the terms of its program with employee representatives, as 
appropriate, under labor relations laws or negotiated agreements. Such 
negotiation, however, cannot change the requirements of this clause. 
Employees covered under collective bargaining agreements will not be 
subject to the requirements of this clause until those agreements have 
been modified, as necessary; provided, however, that if one year after 
commencement of negotiation the parties have failed to reach agreement, 
an impasse will be determined to have been reached and the Contractor 
will unilaterally implement the requirements of this clause.
    (g) The Contractor shall insert a clause containing all the terms of 
this clause, including this paragraph (g), in all subcontracts in which 
work is performed by an employee in a sensitive position, except 
subcontracts for commercial items (see FAR parts 2 and 12).

Contractor whether the Administrator has determined that the subject 
invention was made in the manner specified in paragraph (1) or (2) of 
section 305(a) of the Act.
    (2) Property rights in subject inventions. Each subject invention 
for which the presumption

[[Page 373]]

of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this clause is conclusive or for which there 
has been a determination that it was made in the manner specified in 
paragraph (1) or (2) of section 305(a) of the Act shall be the exclusive 
property of the United States as represented by NASA unless the 
Administrator waives all or any part of the rights of the United States, 
as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this clause.
    (3) Waiver of rights. (i) Section 305(f) of the Act provides for the 
promulgation of regulations by which the Administrator may waive the 
rights of the United States with respect to any invention or class of 
inventions made or that may be made under conditions specified in 
paragraph (1) or (2) of section 305(a) of the Act. The promulgated NASA 
Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1, have adopted the 
Presidential Memorandum on Government Patent Policy of February 18, 
1983, as a guide in acting on petitions (requests) for such waiver of 
rights.
    (ii) As provided in 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1, Contractors may 
petition, either prior to execution of the contract or within 30 days 
after execution of the contract, for advance waiver of rights to any or 
all of the inventions that may be made under a contract. If such a 
petition is not submitted, or if after submission it is denied, the 
Contractor (or an employee inventor of the Contractor) may petition for 
waiver of rights to an identified subject invention within eight months 
of first disclosure of invention in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of 
this clause, or within such longer period as may be authorized in 
accordance with 14 CFR 1245.105.
    (c) Minimum rights reserved by the Government. (1) With respect to 
each subject invention for which a waiver of rights is applicable in 
accordance with 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1, the Government reserves--
    (i) An irrevocable, nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free 
license for the practice of such invention throughout the world by or on 
behalf of the United States or any foreign government in accordance with 
any treaty or agreement with the United States; and
    (ii) Such other rights as stated in 14 CFR 1245.107.
    (2) Nothing contained in this paragraph (c) shall be considered to 
grant to the Government any rights with respect to any invention other 
than a subject invention.
    (d) Minimum rights to the Contractor. (1) The Contractor is hereby 
granted a revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license in each patent 
application filed in any country on a subject invention and any 
resulting patent in which the Government acquires title, unless the 
Contractor fails to disclose the subject invention within the times 
specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this clause. The Contractor's license 
extends to its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the 
corporate structure of which the Contractor is a party and includes the 
right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the 
Contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was 
awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of the 
Administrator except when transferred to the successor of that part of 
the Contractor's business to which the invention pertains.
    (2) The Contractor's domestic license may be revoked or modified by 
the Administrator to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious 
practical application of the subject invention pursuant to an 
application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with 37 CFR 
part 404, Licensing of Government Owned Inventions. This license will 
not be revoked in that field of use or the geographical areas in which 
the Contractor has achieved practical application and continues to make 
the benefits of the invention reasonably accessible to the public. The 
license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at the 
discretion of the Administrator to the extent the Contractor, its 
licensees, or its domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to 
achieve practical application in that foreign country.
    (3) Before revocation or modification of the license, the Contractor 
will be provided a written notice of the Administrator's intention to 
revoke or modify the license, and the Contractor will be allowed 30 days 
(or such other time as may be authorized by the Administrator for good 
cause shown by the Contractor) after the notice to show cause why the 
license should not be revoked or modified. The Contractor has the right 
to appeal to the Administrator any decision concerning the revocation or 
modification of its license.
    (e) Invention identification, disclosures, and reports. (1) The 
Contractor shall establish and maintain active and effective procedures 
to assure that reportable items are promptly identified and disclosed to 
Contractor personnel responsible for the administration of this New 
Technology clause within six months of conception and/or first actual 
reduction to practice, whichever occurs first in the performance of work 
under this contract. These procedures shall include the maintenance of 
laboratory notebooks or equivalent records and other records as are 
reasonably necessary to document the conception and/or the first actual 
reduction to practice of the reportable items, and records that show 
that the procedures for identifying and disclosing reportable items are 
followed. Upon request, the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting 
Officer a description of such procedures for evaluation and for 
determination as to their effectiveness.
    (2) The Contractor will disclose each reportable item to the 
Contracting Officer within two months after the inventor discloses it in 
writing to Contractor personnel

[[Page 374]]

responsible for the administration of this New Technology clause or, if 
earlier, within six months after the Contractor becomes aware that a 
reportable item has been made, but in any event for subject inventions 
before any on sale, public use, or publication of such invention known 
to the Contractor. The disclosure to the agency shall be in the form of 
a written report and shall identify the contract under which the 
reportable item was made and the inventor(s) or innovator(s). It shall 
be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear 
understanding, to the extent known at the time of the disclosure, of the 
nature, purpose, operation, and physical, chemical, biological, or 
electrical characteristics of the reportable item. The disclosure shall 
also identify any publication, on sale, or public use of any subject 
invention and whether a manuscript describing such invention has been 
submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for 
publication at the time of disclosure. In addition, after disclosure to 
the agency, the Contractor will promptly notify the agency of the 
acceptance of any manuscript describing a subject invention for 
publication or of any on sale or public use planned by the Contractor 
for such invention.
    (3) The Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer the 
following:
    (i) Interim reports every 12 months (or such longer period as may be 
specified by the Contracting Officer) from the date of the contract, 
listing reportable items during that period, and certifying that all 
reportable items have been disclosed (or that there are no such 
inventions) and that the procedures required by paragraph (e)(1) of this 
clause have been followed.
    (ii) A final report, within 3 months after completion of the 
contracted work, listing all reportable items or certifying that there 
were no such reportable items, and listing all subcontracts at any tier 
containing a patent rights clause or certifying that there were no such 
subcontracts.
    (4) The Contractor agrees, upon written request of the Contracting 
Officer, to furnish additional technical and other information available 
to the Contractor as is necessary for the preparation of a patent 
application on a subject invention and for the prosecution of the patent 
application, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent 
applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government's 
rights in the subject inventions.
    (5) The Contractor agrees, subject to section 27.302(i), of the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), that the Government may duplicate 
and disclose subject invention disclosures and all other reports and 
papers furnished or required to be furnished pursuant to this clause.
    (f) Examination of records relating to inventions. (1) The 
Contracting Officer or any authorized representative shall, until 3 
years after final payment under this contract, have the right to examine 
any books (including laboratory notebooks), records, and documents of 
the Contractor relating to the conception or first actual reduction to 
practice of inventions in the same field of technology as the work under 
this contract to determine whether--
    (i) Any such inventions are subject inventions;
    (ii) The Contractor has established and maintained the procedures 
required by paragraph (e)(1) of this clause; and
    (iii) The Contractor and its inventors have complied with the 
procedures.
    (2) If the Contracting Officer learns of an unreported Contractor 
invention that the Contracting Officer believes may be a subject 
invention, the Contractor may be required to disclose the invention to 
the agency for a determination of ownership rights.
    (3) Any examination of records under this paragraph will be subject 
to appropriate conditions to protect the confidentiality of the 
information involved.
    (g) Withholding of payment (this paragraph does not apply to 
subcontracts). (1) Any time before final payment under this contract, 
the Contracting Officer may, in the Government's interest, withhold 
payment until a reserve not exceeding $50,000 or 5 percent of the amount 
of this contract, whichever is less, shall have been set aside if, in 
the Contracting Officer's opinion, the Contractor fails to--
    (i) Establish, maintain, and follow effective procedures for 
identifying and disclosing reportable items pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) 
of this clause;
    (ii) Disclose any reportable items pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of 
this clause;
    (iii) Deliver acceptable interim reports pursuant to paragraph 
(e)(3)(i) of this clause; or
    (iv) Provide the information regarding subcontracts pursuant to 
paragraph (h)(4) of this clause.
    (2) Such reserve or balance shall be withheld until the Contracting 
Officer has determined that the Contractor has rectified whatever 
deficiencies exist and has delivered all reports, disclosures, and other 
information required by this clause.
    (3) Final payment under this contract shall not be made before the 
Contractor delivers to the Contracting Officer all disclosures of 
reportable items required by paragraph (e)(2) of this clause, and an 
acceptable final report pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this clause.
    (4) The Contracting Officer may decrease or increase the sums 
withheld up to the maximum authorized above. No amount shall be withheld 
under this paragraph while the

[[Page 375]]

amount specified by this paragraph is being withheld under other 
provisions of the contract. The withholding of any amount or the 
subsequent payment thereof shall not be construed as a waiver of any 
Government rights.
    (h) Subcontracts. (1) Unless otherwise authorized or directed by the 
Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall--
    (i) Include this clause (suitably modified to identify the parties) 
in any subcontract hereunder (regardless of tier) with other than a 
small business firm or nonprofit organization for the performance of 
experimental, developmental, or research work; and
    (ii) Include the clause at FAR 52.227-11 (suitably modified to 
identify the parties) in any subcontract hereunder (regardless of tier) 
with a small business firm or nonprofit organization for the performance 
of experimental, developmental, or research work.
    (2) In the event of a refusal by a prospective subcontractor to 
accept such a clause the Contractor--
    (i) Shall promptly submit a written notice to the Contracting 
Officer setting forth the subcontractor's reasons for such refusal and 
other pertinent information that may expedite disposition of the matter; 
and
    (ii) Shall not proceed with such subcontract without the written 
authorization of the Contracting Officer.
    (3) In the case of subcontracts at any tier, the agency, 
subcontractor, and Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the 
parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the 
subcontractor and NASA with respect to those matters covered by this 
clause.
    (4) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in 
writing upon the award of any subcontract at any tier containing a 
patent rights clause by identifying the subcontractor, the applicable 
patent rights clause, the work to be performed under the subcontract, 
and the dates of award and estimated completion. Upon request of the 
Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall furnish a copy of such 
subcontract, and, no more frequently than annually, a listing of the 
subcontracts that have been awarded.
    (5) The subcontractor will retain all rights provided for the 
Contractor in the clause of paragraph (h)(1)(i) or (ii) of this clause, 
whichever is included in the subcontract, and the Contractor will not, 
as part of the consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights 
in the subcontractor's subject inventions.
    (i) Preference for United States industry. Unless provided 
otherwise, no Contractor that receives title to any subject invention 
and no assignee of any such Contractor shall grant to any person the 
exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United 
States unless such person agrees that any products embodying the subject 
invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. 
However, in individual cases, the requirement may be waived by the 
Administrator upon a showing by the Contractor or assignee that 
reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on 
similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture 
substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances 
domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.

1852.227-71  Requests for waiver of rights to inventions.

    As prescribed in 1827.30-70(c), insert the following provision in 
all solicitations that include the clause at 1852.227-70, New 
Technology:

         Requests for Waiver of Rights to Inventions (Apr 1984)

    (a) In accordance with the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR 
part 1245, subpart 1, waiver of rights to any or all inventions made or 
that may be made under a NASA contract or subcontract with other than a 
small business firm or a domestic nonprofit organization may be 
requested at different time periods. Advance waiver of rights to any or 
all inventions that may be made under a contract or subcontract may be 
requested prior to the execution of the contract or subcontract, or 
within 30 days after execution by the selected contractor. In addition, 
waiver of rights to an identified invention made and reported under a 
contract or subcontract may be requested, even though a request for an 
advance waiver was not made or, if made, was not granted.
    (b) Each request for waiver of rights shall be by petition to the 
Administrator and shall include an identification of the petitioner; 
place of business and address; if petitioner is represented by counsel, 
the name, address and telephone number of the counsel; the signature of 
the petitioner or authorized representative; and the date of signature. 
No specific forms need be used, but the request should contain a 
positive statement that waiver of rights is being requested under the 
NASA Patent Waiver Regulations; a clear indication of whether the 
request is for an advance waiver or for a waiver of rights for an 
individual identified invention; whether foreign rights are also 
requested and, if so, the countries, and a citation of the specific 
section or sections of the regulations under which such rights are 
requested; and the

[[Page 376]]

name, address, and telephone number of the party with whom to 
communicate when the request is acted upon. Requests for advance waiver 
of rights should, preferably, be included with the proposal, but in any 
event in advance of negotiations.
    (c) Petitions for advance waiver, prior to contract execution, must 
be submitted to the Contracting Officer. All other petitions will be 
submitted to the Patent Representative designated in the contract.
    (d) Petitions submitted with proposals selected for negotiation of a 
contract will be forwarded by the Contracting Officer to the 
installation Patent Counsel for processing and then to the Inventions 
and Contributions Board. The Board will consider these petitions and 
where the Board makes the findings to support the waiver, the Board will 
recommend to the Administrator that waiver be granted, and will notify 
the petitioner and the Contracting Officer of the Administrator's 
determination. The Contracting Officer will be informed by the Board 
whenever there is insufficient time or information or other reasons to 
permit a decision to be made without unduly delaying the execution of 
the contract. In the latter event, the petitioner will be so notified by 
the Contracting Officer. All other petitions will be processed by 
installation Patent Counsel and forwarded to the Board. The Board shall 
notify the petitioner of its action and if waiver is granted, the 
conditions, reservations, and obligations thereof will be included in 
the Instrument of Waiver. Whenever the Board notifies a petitioner of a 
recommendation adverse to, or different from, the waiver requested, the 
petitioner may request reconsideration under procedures set forth in the 
Regulations.

1852.227-86  Commercial computer software--licensing.

    As prescribed in 1827.409-70, insert the following clause:

           Commercial Computer Software--Licensing (Dec 1987)

    (a) Any delivered commercial computer software (including 
documentation thereof) developed at private expense and claimed as 
proprietary shall be subject to the restricted rights in paragraph (d) 
of this clause. Where the vendor/contractor proposes its standard 
commercial software license, those applicable portions thereof 
consistent with Federal laws, standard industry practices, the Federal 
Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and the NASA FAR Supplement, including the 
restricted rights in paragraph (d) of this clause, are incorporated into 
and made a part of this purchase order/contract.
    (b) Although the vendor/contractor may not propose its standard 
commercial software license until after this purchase order/contract has 
been issued, or at or after the time the computer software is delivered, 
such license shall nevertheless be deemed incorporated into and made a 
part of this purchase order/contract under the same terms and conditions 
as in paragraph (a) of this clause. For purposes of receiving updates, 
correction notices, consultation, and similar activities on the computer 
software, the NASA Contracting Officer or the NASA Contracting Officer's 
Technical Representative/User may sign any agreement, license, or 
registration form or card and return it directly to the vendor/
contractor; however, such signing shall not alter any of the terms and 
conditions of this clause.
    (c) The vendor's/contractor's acceptance is expressly limited to the 
terms and conditions of this purchase order/contract. If the specified 
computer software is shipped or delivered to NASA, it shall be 
understood that the vendor/contractor has unconditionally accepted the 
terms and conditions set forth in this clause, and that such terms and 
conditions (including the incorporated license) constitute the entire 
agreement between the parties concerning rights in the computer 
software.
    (d) The following restricted rights shall apply:
    (1) The commercial computer software may not be used, reproduced, or 
disclosed by the Government except as provided below or

[[Page 378]]

otherwise expressly stated in the purchase order/contract.
    (2) The commercial computer software may be--
    (i) Used, or copied for use, in or with any computer owned or leased 
by, or on behalf of, the Government; provided, the software is not used, 
nor copied for use, in or with more than one computer simultaneously, 
unless otherwise permitted by the license incorporated under paragraph 
(a) or (b) of this clause;
    (ii) Reproduced for safekeeping (archives) or backup purposes;
    (iii) Modified, adapted, or combined with other computer software, 
provided that the modified, combined, or adapted portions of the 
derivative software incorporating restricted computer software shall be 
subject to the same restricted rights; and
    (iv) Disclosed and reproduced for use by Government contractors or 
their subcontractors in accordance with the restricted rights in 
paragraphs (d)(2) (i), (ii), and (iii) of this clause; provided they 
have the Government's permission to use the computer software and have 
also agreed to protect the computer software from unauthorized use and 
disclosure.
    (3) If the incorporated vendor's/contractor's software license 
contains provisions or rights that are less restrictive than the 
restricted rights in paragraph (d)(2) of this clause, then the less 
restrictive provisions or rights shall prevail.
    (4) If the computer software is published, copyrighted computer 
software, it is licensed to the Government, without disclosure 
prohibitions, with the rights in paragraphs (d) (2) and (3) of this 
clause.
    (5) The computer software may be marked with any appropriate 
proprietary notice that is consistent with the rights in paragraphs (d) 
(2), (3), and (4) of this clause.

1852.227-87  Transfer of Technical Data Under Space Station International Agreements.

    As prescribed at 1827.670-2, insert the following clause:

 Transfer of Technical Data Under Space Station International Agreement 
                               (Apr 1989)

    1. In the cooperative Space Station Freedom program, NASA has the 
authority to provide to the international partners all information 
necessary to implement the multilateral Space Station Intergovernmental 
Agreement and the Space Station Memoranda of Understanding. NASA is 
committed under these Space Station agreements to provide its 
international Space Station partners with certain technical data which 
are subject to the U.S. export control laws and regulations. NASA will 
have obtained any necessary approvals from the Department of State for 
the transfer of any such technical data. Space Station contractors, 
acting as agents of NASA under the specific written direction of the 
Contracting Officer, or designated representative, require no other 
separate approval under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations 
(ITAR) to transfer such data.
    2. The Contractor agrees, when specifically directed in writing by 
the Contracting Officer, or designated representative, to transfer 
identified technical data to a named foreign recipient, in the manner 
directed. No export control marking should be affixed to the data unless 
so directed. If directed, the text of the marking to be affixed will be 
furnished by the Contracting Officer or designated representative.
    3. It should be emphasized that the transfer is limited solely to 
those technical data which NASA specifically identifies and directs the 
Contractor to transfer in accordance with paragraph 2 of this clause, 
and that all other transfers of technical data to foreign entities are 
subject to the requirements of the U.S. export control laws and 
regulations.
    4. Nothing contained in this clause affects the allocation of 
technical data rights between NASA and the Contractor or any 
subcontractors as set forth in the Rights in Data clause of this 
Contract, nor the protection of any proprietary technical data which may 
be available to the Contractor or any subcontractor under that clause.
    5. The Contractor agrees to include this clause, including this 
paragraph 5, in all subcontracts hereunder, appropriately modified to 
reflect the relationship of the parties.

1852.228-70   Aircraft ground and flight risk.

    As prescribed in 1828.370(a), insert the following clause. The 
purpose of this clause is to have the Government assume risks that 
generally entail unusually high insurance premiums and are not covered 
by the contractor's contents, work-in-process, and similar insurance. 
Since the definitions in the clause may not cover every situation that 
should be covered to achieve this purpose, the clause may be modified as

[[Page 379]]

follows: If the contract covers helicopters, vertical take-off aircraft, 
lighter-than-air airships, or other nonconventional types of aircraft, 
the definition of ``aircraft'' should be modified to specify that the 
aircraft has reached a point of manufacture comparable to that specified 
in the standard definition, which is written for conventional winged 
aircraft. The definition of ``in the open'' may be modified to include 
``hush houses,'' test hangars, comparable structures, and other 
designated areas. In addition, clause paragraph (d)(3) may be modified 
to provide for Government assumption of risk of transportation by

              Aircraft Ground and Flight Risk October 1996

    (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract, except as 
may be specifically provided in the Schedule as an exception to this 
clause, the Government, subject to the definitions and limitations of 
this clause, assumes the risk of damage to, or loss or destruction of, 
aircraft in the open, during operation, or in flight and agrees that the 
Contractor shall not be liable to the Government for any such damage, 
loss, or destruction.
    (b) For the purposes of this clause, the following definitions 
apply:
    (1) Unless otherwise specifically provided in the Schedule, 
``aircraft'' includes--
    (i) Aircraft (including both complete aircraft and aircraft in the 
course of being manufactured, disassembled, or reassembled; provided 
that an engine, wing, or a portion of a wing is attached to the 
fuselage) to be furnished to the Government under this contract (whether 
before or after Government acceptance); and
    (ii) Aircraft (regardless of whether in a state of disassembly or 
reassembly) furnished by the Government to the Contractor under this 
contract, including all property installed in, being installed in, or 
temporarily removed from them, unless the aircraft and property are 
covered by a separate bailment agreement.
    (2) ``In the open'' means located wholly outside of buildings on the 
Contractor's premises, or at such other places as may be described in 
the Schedule as being in the open for the purposes of this clause, 
except that aircraft furnished by the Government are considered to be in 
the open at all times while in the Contractor's possession, care, 
custody, or control.
    (3) ``Flight'' includes any flight demonstration, flight test, taxi 
test, or other flight made in the performance of this contract, or for 
the purpose of safeguarding the aircraft, or previously approved in 
writing by the Contracting Officer.
    (i) With respect to land-based aircraft, flight commences with the 
taxi roll from a flight line on the Contractor's premises and continues 
until the aircraft has completed the taxi roll in returning to a flight 
line on the Contractor's premises.
    (ii) With respect to seaplanes, flight commences with the launching 
from a ramp on the Contractor's premises and continues until the 
aircraft has completed its landing run upon return and is beached at a 
ramp on the Contractor's premises.
    (iii) With respect to helicopters, flight commences upon engagement 
of the rotors for the purpose of take-off from the Contractor's premises 
and continues until the aircraft has returned to the ground on the 
Contractor's premises and the rotors are disengaged.
    (iv) With respect to vertical take-off aircraft, flight commences 
upon disengagement from any launching platform or device on the 
Contractor's premises and continues until the aircraft has been re-
engaged to any launching platform or device on the Contractor's 
premises; provided, however, that aircraft off the Contractor's premises 
shall be deemed to be in flight when on the ground or water only during 
periods of reasonable duration following emergency landing, other 
landings made in the performance of this contract, or landings approved 
by the Contracting Officer in writing.
    (4) ``Contractor's premises'' means those premises designated as 
such in the Schedule or in writing by the Contracting Officer, and any 
other place to which aircraft are moved for the purpose of safeguarding 
the aircraft.
    (5) ``Operation'' means operations and tests, other than on any 
production line, of aircraft not in flight, whether or not the aircraft 
is in the open or in motion. It includes operations and tests of 
equipment, accessories, and power plants only when installed in 
aircraft.
    (6) ``Flight crew members'' means the pilot, copilot, and, unless 
otherwise specifically provided in the Schedule, the flight engineer and 
navigator when requirement or assigned to their respective crew 
positions to conduct any flight on behalf of the Contractor.
    (7) ``Contractor's managerial personnel'' means the Contractor's 
directors, officers, and any managers, superintendents, or equivalent 
representatives who have supervision or direction of all or 
substantially all

[[Page 380]]

of the Contractor's business or of the Contractor's operations at any 
one plant, a separate location at which this contract is performed, or a 
separate and complete major industrial operation in connection with the 
performance of this contract.
    (c)(1) The Government's assumption of risk under this clause, as to 
aircraft in the open, shall continue in effect unless terminated 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this clause. If the Contracting Officer 
finds that an aircraft is in the open under unreasonable conditions, the 
Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor in writing of the 
conditions found to be unreasonable and require the Contractor to 
correct them within a reasonable time.
    (2) Upon receipt of this notice, the Contractor shall act promptly 
to correct these conditions, regardless of whether it agrees that they 
are in fact unreasonable. To the extent that the Contracting Officer may 
later determine that they were not in fact unreasonable, an equitable 
adjustment shall be made in the contract price to compensate the 
Contractor for any additional costs incurred in correcting them, and the 
contract shall be modified in writing accordingly.
    (3)(i) If the Contracting Officer finds that the Contractor has 
failed to act promptly to correct unreasonable conditions or has failed 
to correct them within a reasonable time, the Contracting Officer may by 
written notice terminate the Government's assumption of risk under this 
clause for any aircraft which is in the open under those conditions. 
This termination shall be effective at 12:01 A.M. on the 15th day 
following the day of receipt by the Contractor of the notice.
    (ii) If the Contracting Officer later determines that the Contractor 
acted promptly to correct the conditions or that the time taken by the 
Contractor was not in fact unreasonable, an equitable adjustment shall, 
notwithstanding paragraph (g) of this clause, be made to compensate the 
Contractor for any additional costs incurred as a result of the 
termination, and the contract shall be modified in writing accordingly.
    (4) If the Government's assumption of risk under this clause is 
terminated in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this clause, the risk 
of loss with respect to Government-furnished property shall be 
determined in accordance with the Government property clause of this 
contract, if any, until the Government's assumption of risk is 
reinstated in accordance with paragraph (c)(5) of this clause.
    (5)(i) When unreasonable conditions have been corrected, the 
Contractor shall promptly notify the Government. The Government may or 
may not elect to reassume the risks and relieve the Contractor of 
liabilities as provided in this clause, and the Contracting Officer 
shall notify the Contractor of the Government's election.
    (ii) If, after correction of the conditions, the Government elects 
to reassume the risks and relieve the Contractor of liabilities, the 
Contractor shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment for any costs of 
insurance extending from the end of the third working day after the 
Contractor notifies the Government of the correction until the 
Government notifies the Contractor of that election.
    (iii) If the Government elects not to reassume the risks and the 
conditions have in fact been corrected, the Contractor shall be entitled 
to an equitable adjustment for any costs of insurance extending after 
the third working day referred to in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this 
clause.
    (d) The Government's assumption of risk shall not extend to damage 
to, or loss or destruction of aircraft--
    (1) Resulting from failure of the Contractor, due to willful 
misconduct or lack of good faith of any of the Contractor's managerial 
personnel, to maintain and administer a program for protecting and 
preserving aircraft in the open and during operation, in accordance with 
sound industrial practice;
    (2) Sustained during flight if the flight crew members conducting 
the flight have not been approved in writing by the Contracting Officer;
    (3) While in the course of transportation by rail or by conveyance 
on public streets, highways, or waterways, except for Government-
furnished property;
    (4) The extent that the damage, loss, or destruction is in fact 
covered by insurance;
    (5) Consisting of wear and tear, deterioration (including rust and 
corrosion), freezing, or mechanical, structural, or electrical breakdown 
or failure, unless this damage is the result of other loss, damage, or 
destruction covered by this clause (except that, in the case of 
Government-furnished property, if the damage consists of reasonable wear 
and tear or deterioration or results from an inherent defect in such 
property, this exclusion shall not apply); or
    (6) Sustained while the aircraft is being worked upon and directly 
resulting from the work, including but not limited to any repairing, 
adjusting, servicing, or maintenance operation, unless the damage, loss, 
or destruction is of a type that would be covered by insurance that 
would customarily have been maintained by the Contractor at the time of 
the damage, loss, or destruction, but for the Government's assumption of 
risk under this clause.
    (e)(1) With the exception of damage to, or loss or destruction of, 
aircraft in flight, the Government's assumption of risk under this 
clause shall not extend to the first $1,000 of loss or damage resulting 
from each separately occurring event. The Contractor assumes the risk of 
and shall be responsible for

[[Page 381]]

the first $1,000 of loss of or damage to aircraft in the open or during 
operation resulting from each separately occurring event, except for 
reasonable wear and tear and except to the extent the loss or damage is 
caused by negligence of Government personnel.
    (2) If the Government elects to require that the aircraft be 
replaced or restored by the Contractor to its condition immediately 
prior to the damage, the equitable adjustment in the price authorized by 
paragraph (i) of this clause shall not include the dollar amount of the 
risk assumed by the Contractor under this paragraph (e). If the 
Government does not elect repair or replacement, the Contractor agrees 
to credit the contract price or pay the Government $1,000 (or the amount 
of the loss if smaller) as directed by the Contracting Officer.
    (f) No subcontractor may be relieved from liability for damage to, 
or loss or destruction of, aircraft while in its possession or control, 
except to the extent that the subcontract, with the Contracting 
Officer's prior written approval, provides for relief of the 
subcontractor from that liability. In the absence of such approval, the 
subcontract shall require the return of the aircraft in as good 
condition as when received, except for reasonable wear and tear or for 
the utilization of the property in accordance with the provisions of 
this contract. If a subcontractor has not been relieved from liability 
and any damage, loss, or destruction occurs, the Contractor shall 
enforce the liability of the subcontractor for that damage to, or loss 
or destruction of, the aircraft for the benefit of the Government.
    (g) The Contractor warrants that the contract price does not and 
will not include, except as this clause may otherwise authorize, any 
charge or contingency reserve for insurance (including self-insurance 
funds or reserves) covering any damage to, or loss or destruction of, 
aircraft while in the open, during operation, or in flight, the risk of 
which has been assumed by the Government under this clause, whether or 
not such assumption may be terminated as to aircraft in the open.
    (h)(1) In the event of damage to, or loss or destruction of, 
aircraft in the open, during operation, or in flight, the Contractor 
shall take all reasonable steps to protect the aircraft from further 
damage, separate damaged and undamaged aircraft, and put all aircraft in 
the best possible order. Further, except in cases covered by paragraph 
(e) of this clause, the Contractor should furnish to the Contracting 
Officer a statement of--
    (i) The damaged, lost, or destroyed aircraft;
    (ii) The time and origin of the damage, loss, or destruction;
    (iii) All known interests in commingled property of which aircraft 
are a part; and
    (iv) Any insurance covering any part of the interest in the 
commingled property.
    (2) Except in cases covered by paragraph (e) of this clause, an 
equitable adjustment shall be made in the amount due under this contract 
for expenditures made by the Contractor in performing its obligations 
under this paragraph (h), and this contract shall be modified in writing 
accordingly.
    (i)(1) If, before delivery and acceptance by the Government, any 
aircraft is damaged, lost, or destroyed and the Government has under 
this clause assumed the risk of that damage, loss, or destruction, the 
Government shall either
    (i) Require that the aircraft be replaced or restored by the 
Contractor to its condition immediately prior to the damage or
    (ii) Terminate this contract with respect to that aircraft.
    (2) If the Government requires that the aircraft be replaced or 
restored, an equitable adjustment shall be made in the amount due under 
this contract and in the time required for its performance, and the 
contract shall be modified in writing accordingly.
    (3) If this contract is terminated under this paragraph (i)(1)(ii) 
with respect to the aircraft, and under this clause the Government has 
assumed the risk of the damage, loss, or destruction, the Contractor 
shall be paid the contract price for the aircraft (or, if applicable, 
any work to be performed on the aircraft) less any amounts the 
Contracting Officer determines (i) that it would have cost the 
Contractor to complete the aircraft (or any work to be performed on it), 
together with any anticipated profit on the uncompleted work and (ii) to 
be the value, if any, of the damaged aircraft or any remaining portion 
of it retained by the Contractor. The Contracting Officer shall have the 
right to prescribe the manner of disposition of the damaged, lost, or 
destroyed aircraft or any remaining parts of it, and, if the Contractor 
incurs additional costs as a result of such disposition, a further 
equitable adjustment shall be made in the amount due to the Contractor.
    (j)(1) If the Contractor is at any time reimbursed or compensated by 
any third person for any damage, loss, or destruction of any aircraft, 
the risk of which has been assumed by the Government under this clause 
and for which the Contractor has been compensated by the Government, it 
shall equitably reimburse the Government.
    (2) The Contractor shall do nothing to prejudice the Government's 
rights to recover against third parties for any such damage, loss, or 
destruction and, upon the request of the Contracting Officer, shall at 
the Government's expense furnish to the Government all reasonable 
assistance and cooperation (including the prosecution of suits and the 
execution of instruments of assignment or

[[Page 382]]

subrogation in favor of the Government) in obtaining recovery.

damage, loss, or destruction under the Government Property (Cost-
Reimbursement, Time-and-Materials, or Labor-Hour Contracts) clause of 
this contract or under paragraph (a) of this clause, an equitable 
adjustment for any resulting repair, restoration, or replacement 
required under this contract shall be made: (i) In the estimated cost, 
the delivery schedule, or both and (ii) in the amount of any fee to be 
paid to the Contractor, and the contract shall be modified in writing 
accordingly.
    (2) In determining the amount of adjustment in the fee that is 
equitable, any fault of the Contractor, its employees, or any

1852.228-72  Cross-Waiver of liability for space shuttle services.

    As prescribed in 1828.371 (b) and (e), insert the following clause:

    Cross-Waiver of Liability for Space Shuttle Services (Sept 1993)

    (a) As prescribed by regulation (14 CFR part 1266), NASA agreements 
involving Space Shuttle flights are required to contain broad cross-
waivers of liability among the parties and the parties related entities 
to encourage participation in space exploration, use, and investment. 
The purpose of this clause is to extend this cross-waiver requirement to 
Contractors and related entities under their contracts. This cross-
waiver of liability shall be broadly construed to achieve the objective 
of encouraging participation in space activities.
    (b) As used in this clause, the term:
    (1) Contractors and Subcontractors include suppliers of any kind.
    (2) Damage means:
    (i) Bodily injury to, or other impairment of health of, or death of, 
any person;
    (ii) Damage to, loss of, or loss of use of any property;
    (iii) Loss of revenue or profits; or
    (iv) Other direct, indirect, or consequential damage;
    (3) Party means a person or entity that signs an agreement involving 
a Space Shuttle service;

[[Page 383]]

    (4) Payload means all property to be flown or used on or in the 
Space Shuttle; and
    (5) Protected Space Operations means all Space Shuttle and payload 
activities on Earth, in outer space, or in transit between Earth and 
outer space performed in furtherance of an agreement involving Space 
Shuttle services or performed under this contract. ``Protected Space 
Operations'' excludes activities on Earth which are conducted on return 
from space to develop further a payload's product or process except when 
such development is for Space Shuttle-related activities necessary to 
implement an agreement involving Space Shuttle services or to perform 
this contract. It includes, but is not limited to:
    (i) Research, design, development, test, manufacture, assembly, 
integration, operation, or use of the Space Shuttle, transfer vehicles, 
payloads, related support equipment, and facilities and services;
    (ii) All activities related to ground support, test, training, 
simulation, or guidance and control equipment and related facilities or

    (i) A party's Contractors or subcontractors at any tier;
    (ii) A party's users or customers at any tier; or
    (iii) A Contractor or subcontractor of a party's user or customer at 
any tier.
    (c) (1) The Contractor agrees to a waiver of liability pursuant to 
which the Contractor waives all claims against any of the entities or 
persons listed in paragraph (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iii) of this clause 
based on damage arising out of Protected Space Operations. This waiver 
shall apply only if the person, entity, or property causing the damage 
is involved in Protected Space Operations and the person, entity, or 
property damaged is damaged by virtue of its involvement in Protected 
Space Operations. This waiver shall apply to any claims for damage, 
whatever the legal basis for such claims, including but not limited to 
delict (a term used in civil law countries to denote a class of cases 
similar to tort) and tort (including negligence of every degree and 
kind) and contract, against:
    (i) Any party other than the Government;
    (ii) A related entity of any party other than the Government; and
    (iii) The employees of any of the entities identified in (c)(1)(i) 
and (c)(1)(ii) of this clause.
    (2) The Contractor agrees to extend the waiver of liability as set 
forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause to subcontractors at any tier 
by requiring them, by contract or otherwise, to agree to waive all 
claims against the entities or persons identified in paragraphs 
(c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iii) of this clause.
    (3) For avoidance of doubt, this cross-waiver includes a cross-
waiver of liability arising from the Convention on International 
Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, (March 29, 1972, 24 United 
States Treaties and other International Agreements (U.S.T.) 2389,

between the Government's related entities (e.g., claims between the 
Government and the Contractor are included within this exception);
    (ii) Claims made by a natural person, his/her estate, survivors, or 
subrogees for injury or death of such natural person;
    (iii) Claims for damage caused by willful misconduct; and
    (iv) Intellectual property claims.
    (5) Nothing in this clause shall be construed to create the basis 
for a claim or suit where none would otherwise exist.

    The Contractor shall obtain and maintain insurance coverage as 
follows for the performance of this contract:
    (a) Worker's compensation and employer's liability insurance as 
required by applicable Federal and state workers' compensation and 
occupational disease statutes. If occupational diseases are not 
compensable under

[[Page 384]]

those statutes, they shall be covered under the employer's liability 
section of the insurance policy, except when contract operations are so 
commingled with the Contractor's commercial operations that it would not 
be practical. The employer's liability coverage shall be at least 
$100,000, except in States with exclusive or monopolistic funds that do 
not permit workers' compensation to be written by private carriers.
    (b) Comprehensive general (bodily injury) liability insurance of at 
least $500,000 per occurrence.
    (c) Motor vehicle liability insurance written on the comprehensive

vehicles operated in the United States shall provide coverage of at 
least $200,000 per person and $500,000 per occurrence for bodily injury 
liability and $20,000 per occurrence for property damage. The amount of 
liability coverage on other policies shall be commensurate with any 
legal requirements of the locality and sufficient to meet normal and 
customary claims.
    (d) Comprehensive general and motor vehicle liability policies shall 
contain a provision worded as follows:
    ``The insurance company waives any right of subrogation against the 
United States of America which may arise by reason of any payment under 
the policy.''
    (e) When aircraft are used in connection with performing the 
contract, aircraft public and passenger liability insurance of at least 
$200,000 per person and $500,000 per occurrence for bodily injury, other 
than passenger liability, and $200,000 per occurrence for property 
damage. Coverage for passenger liability bodily injury shall be at least 
$200,000 multiplied by the number of seats or passengers, whichever is 
greater.

Operations. This waiver shall apply only if the person, entity, or 
property causing the damage is involved in Protected Space Operations 
and the person, entity, or property damaged is damaged by virtue of its 
involvement in Protected Space Operations. The cross-waiver shall apply 
to any claims for damage, whatever the legal basis for such claims,

Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, (March 29, 1972, 24 United 
States Treaties and other International Agreements (U.S.T.) 2389,

claims between the related entities of any Partner State (e.g., claims 
between the Government and the Contractor are included within this 
exception);

Date        Amounts

    (b) The Contractor agrees to perform or have performed work on the 
items specified in paragraph (a) of this clause up to the point at 
which, if this contract is terminated pursuant to the Termination for 
Convenience of the Government clause of this contract, the total amount 
payable by the Government (including amounts payable for subcontracts 
and settlement costs) pursuant to paragraphs (f) and (g) of that clause 
would, in the exercise of reasonable judgment by the Contractor, 
approximate the total amount at the time allotted to the contract. The 
Contractor is not obligated to continue performance of the work beyond 
that point. The Government is not obligated in any event to pay or 
reimburse the Contractor more than the amount from time to time allotted 
to the contract, anything to the contrary in the Termination for 
Convenience of the Government clause notwithstanding.
    (c) (1) It is contemplated that funds presently allotted to this 
contract will cover the work to be performed until ____.
    (2) If funds allotted are considered by the Contractor to be 
inadequate to cover the work to be performed until that date, or an 
agreed date substituted for it, the Contractor shall notify the 
Contracting Officer in writing when within the next 60 days the work 
will reach a point at which, if the contract is terminated pursuant to 
the Termination for Convenience of the Government clause of this 
contract, the total amount payable by the Government (including amounts 
payable for subcontracts and settlement costs) pursuant to paragraphs 
(f) and (g) of that clause will approximate 75 percent of the total 
amount then allotted to the contract.

referred to in paragraph (c)(2) of this clause will be reached and the 
estimated amount of additional funds required to continue performance to

substituted for it.
    (ii) The Contractor shall, 60 days in advance of the date specified 
in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause, or an agreed date substituted for 
it, advise the Contracting Officer in writing as to the estimated amount 
of additional funds required for the timely performance of the contract 
for a further period as may be specified in the contract or otherwise 
agreed to by the parties.
    (4) If, after the notification referred to in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) 
of this clause, additional funds are not allotted by the date specified 
in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause, or an agreed date substituted for 
it, the Contracting Officer shall, upon the Contractor's written 
request, terminate this contract on that date or on the date set forth 
in the request, whichever is later, pursuant to the Termination for 
Convenience of the Government clause.

continued performance of the work under this contract, the parties shall 
agree on the applicable period of contract performance to be covered by 
these funds. The provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this clause 
shall apply to these additional allotted funds and the substituted date 
pertaining to them, and the contract shall be modified accordingly.
    (e) If, solely by reason of the Government's failure to allot 
additional funds in amounts sufficient for the timely performance of 
this contract, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in 
the performance of the work under this contract, and if additional funds 
are allotted, an equitable adjustment

consent of the Contractor, after notice of termination, allot additional 
funds for this contract.
    (g) The provisions of this clause with respect to termination shall 
in no way be deemed to limit the rights of the Government under the 
default clause of this contract. The provisions of this Limitation of 
Funds clause are limited to the work on and allotment of funds for the 
items set forth in paragraph (a). This clause shall become inoperative 
upon the allotment of funds for the total price of said work except for

Contractor, neither CASI nor NASA is obligated to search for or change 
the format of the information. A failure to furnish information shall 
not entitle the Contractor to an equitable adjustment under the terms 
and conditions of this contract.
    (c) When the contract otherwise requires the submission of monthly 
progress, quarterly progress, or final reports, as defined at 
1827.406(b), the last page of such reports shall be a completed Standard 
Form (SF) 298, Report Documentation Page.
    (d) When the contract requires the delivery of reports or data to 
CASI, a reproducible copy and a printed or reproduced copy of such 
reports or data shall be concurrently submitted to: Center for AeroSpace 
Information (CASI), Attn: Accessioning Department, 800 Elkridge Landing 
Road, Linthicum Heights, MD 21090-2934.

1852.235-72  Instructions for responding to NASA Research Announcements.

    As prescribed in 1835.070(c), insert the following provision:

  Instructions for Responding to NASA Research Announcements (January 
                                  1997)

    (a) General.
    (1) Proposals received in response to a NASA Research Announcement 
(NRA) will be used only for evaluation purposes. NASA does not allow a 
proposal, the contents of which are not available without restriction 
from another source, or any unique ideas submitted in response to an NRA 
to be used as the basis of a solicitation or in negotiation with other 
organizations, nor is a pre-award synopsis published for individual 
proposals.
    (2) A solicited proposal that results in a NASA award becomes part 
of the record of that transaction and may be available to the public on 
specific request; however, information or material that NASA and the 
awardee mutually agree to be of a privileged nature will be held in 
confidence to the extent permitted by law, including the Freedom of 
Information Act.
    (3) NRAs contain programmatic information and certain requirements 
which apply only to proposals prepared in response to that particular 
announcement. These instructions contain the general proposal 
preparation information which applies to responses to all NRAs.
    (4) A contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other agreement may 
be used to accomplish an effort funded in response to an NRA. NASA will 
determine the appropriate instrument. Contracts resulting from NRAs are 
subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the NASA FAR 
Supplement. Any resultant grants or cooperative agreements will be 
awarded and administered in accordance with the NASA Grant and 
Cooperative Agreement Handbook (NPG 5800.1).
    (5) NASA does not have mandatory forms or formats for responses to 
NRAs; however, it is requested that proposals conform to the guidelines 
in these instructions. NASA may accept proposals without discussion; 
hence, proposals should initially be as complete as possible and be 
submitted on the proposers' most favorable terms.
    (6) To be considered for award, a submission must, at a minimum, 
present a specific project within the areas delineated by the NRA; 
contain sufficient technical and cost information to permit a meaningful 
evaluation; be signed by an official authorized to legally bind the 
submitting organization; not merely offer to perform standard services 
or to just provide computer facilities or services; and not 
significantly duplicate a more specific current or pending NASA 
solicitation.
    (b) NRA-Specific Items. Several proposal submission items appear in 
the NRA itself: the unique NRA identifier; when to submit proposals; 
where to send proposals; number of copies required; and sources for more 
information. Items included in these instructions may be supplemented by 
the NRA.
    (c) The following information is needed to permit consideration in 
an objective manner. NRAs will generally specify topics for which 
additional information or greater detail is desirable. Each proposal 
copy shall contain all submitted material, including a copy of the 
transmittal letter if it contains substantive information.
    (1) Transmittal Letter or Prefatory Material.
    (i) The legal name and address of the organization and specific 
division or campus identification if part of a larger organization;
    (ii) A brief, scientifically valid project title intelligible to a 
scientifically literate reader and suitable for use in the public press;
    (iii) Type of organization: e.g., profit, nonprofit, educational, 
small business, minority, women-owned, etc;
    (iv) Name and telephone number of the principal investigator and 
business personnel who may be contacted during evaluation or 
negotiation;
    (v) Identification of other organizations that are currently 
evaluating a proposal for the same efforts;
    (vi) Identification of the NRA, by number and title, to which the 
proposal is responding;
    (vii) Dollar amount requested, desired starting date, and duration 
of project;
    (viii) Date of submission; and

[[Page 392]]

    (ix) Signature of a responsible official or authorized 
representative of the organization, or any other person authorized to 
legally bind the organization (unless the signature appears on the 
proposal itself).
    (2) Restriction on Use and Disclosure of Proposal Information. 
Information contained in proposals is used for evaluation purposes only. 
Offerors or quoters should, in order to maximize protection of trade 
secrets or other information that is confidential or privileged, place 
the following notice on the title page of the proposal and specify the 
information subject to the notice by inserting an appropriate 
identification in the notice. In any event, information contained in 
proposals will be protected to the extent permitted by law, but NASA 
assumes no liability for use and disclosure of information not made 
subject to the notice.

    Notice--Restriction on Use and Disclosure of Proposal Information

    The information (data) contained in [insert page numbers or other 
identification] of this proposal constitutes a trade secret and/or 
information that is commercial or financial and confidential or 
privileged. It is furnished to the Government in confidence with the 
understanding that it will not, without permission of the offeror, be 
used or disclosed other than for evaluation purposes; provided, however, 
that in the event a contract (or other agreement) is awarded on the 
basis of this proposal the Government shall have the right to use and 
disclose this information (data) to the extent provided in the contract 
(or other agreement). This restriction does not limit the Government's 
right to use or disclose this information (data0 if obtained from 
another source without restriction.
    (3) Abstract. Include a concise (200-300 word if not otherwise 
specified in the NRA) abstract describing the objective and the method 
of approach.
    (4) Project Description.
    (i) The main body of the proposal shall be a detailed statement of 
the work to be undertaken and should include objectives and expected 
significance; relation to the present state of knowledge; and relation 
to previous work done on the project and to related work in progress 
elsewhere. The statement should outline the plan of work, including the 
broad design of experiments to be undertaken and a description of 
experimental methods and procedures. The project description should 
address the evaluation factors in these instructions and any specific 
factors in the NRA. Any substantial collaboration with individuals not 
referred to in the budget or use of consultants should be described. 
Subcontracting significant portions of a research project is 
discouraged.
    (ii) When it is expected that the effort will require more than one 
year, the proposal should cover the complete project to the extent that 
it can be reasonably anticipated. Principal emphasis should be on the 
first year of work, and the description should distinguish clearly 
between the first year's work and work planned for subsequent years.
    (5) Management Approach. For large or complex efforts involving 
interactions among numerous individuals or other organizations, plans 
for distribution of responsibilities and arrangements for ensuring a 
coordinated effort should be described.
    (6) Personnel. The principal investigator is responsible for 
supervision of the work and participates in the conduct of the research 
regardless of whether or not compensated under the award. A short 
biographical sketch of the principal investigator, a list of principal 
publications and any exceptional qualifications should be included. Omit 
social security number and other personal items which do not merit 
consideration in evaluation of the proposal. Give similar biographical 
information on other senior professional personnel who will be directly 
associated with the project. Give the names and titles of any other 
scientists and technical personnel associated substantially with the 
project in an advisory capacity. Universities should list the 
approximate number of students or other assistants, together with 
information as to their level of academic attainment. Any special 
industry-university cooperative arrangements should be described.
    (7) Facilities and Equipment.
    (i) Describe available facilities and major items of equipment 
especially adapted or suited to the proposed project, and any additional 
major equipment that will be required. Identify any Government-owned 
facilities, industrial plant equipment, or special tooling that are 
proposed for use. Include evidence of its availability and the cognizant 
Government points of contact.
    (ii) Before requesting a major item of capital equipment, the 
proposer should determine if sharing or loan of equipment already within 
the organization is a feasible alternative. Where such arrangements 
cannot be made, the proposal should so state. The need for items that 
typically can be used for research and non-research purposes should be 
explained.
    (8) Proposed Costs
    (i) Proposals should contain cost and technical parts in one volume: 
do not use separate ``confidential'' salary pages. As applicable, 
include separate cost estimates for salaries and wages; fringe benefits; 
equipment; expendable materials and supplies; services; domestic and 
foreign travel; ADP expenses; publication or page charges; consultants;

[[Page 393]]

subcontracts; other miscellaneous identifiable direct costs; and 
indirect costs. List salaries and wages in appropriate organizational 
categories (e.g., principal investigator, other scientific and 
engineering professionals, graduate students, research assistants, and 
technicians and other non-professional personnel). Estimate all staffing 
data in terms of staff-months or fractions of full-time.
    (ii) Explanatory notes should accompany the cost proposal to provide 
identification and estimated cost of major capital equipment items to be 
acquired; purpose and estimated number and lengths of trips planned; 
basis for indirect cost computation (including date of most recent 
negotiation and cognizant agency); and clarification of other items in 
the cost proposal that are not self-evident. List estimated expenses as 
yearly requirements by major work phases.
    (iii) Allowable costs are governed by FAR Part 31 and the NASA FAR 
Supplement Part 1831 (and OMB Circulars A-21 for educational 
institutions and A-122 for nonprofit organizations).
    (9) Security. Proposals should not contain security classified 
material. If the research requires access to or may generate security 
classified information, the submitter will be required to comply with 
Government security regulations.
    (10) Current Support. For other current projects being conducted by 
the principal investigator, provide title of project, sponsoring agency, 
and ending date.
    (11) Special Matters.
    (i) Include any required statements of environmental impact of the 
research, human subject or animal care provisions, conflict of interest, 
or on such other topics as may be required by the nature of the effort 
and current statutes, executive orders, or other current Government-wide 
guidelines.
    (ii) Proposers should include a brief description of the 
organization, its facilities, and previous work experience in the field 
of the proposal. Identify the cognizant Government audit agency, 
inspection agency, and administrative contracting officer, when 
applicable.
    (d) Renewal Proposals.
    (1) Renewal proposals for existing awards will be considered in the 
same manner as proposals for new endeavors. A renewal proposal should 
not repeat all of the information that was in the original proposal. The 
renewal proposal should refer to its predecessor, update the parts that 
are no longer current, and indicate what elements of the research are 
expected to be covered during the period for which support is desired. A 
description of any significant findings since the most recent progress 
report should be included. The renewal proposal should treat, in 
reasonable detail, the plans for the next period, contain a cost 
estimate, and otherwise adhere to these instructions.
    (2) NASA may renew an effort either through amendment of an existing 
contract or by a new award.
    (e) Length. Unless otherwise specified in the NRA, effort should be 
made to keep proposals as brief as possible, concentrating on 
substantive material. Few proposals need exceed 15-20 pages. Necessary 
detailed information, such as reprints, should be included as 
attachments. A complete set of attachments is necessary for each copy of 
the proposal. As proposals are not returned, avoid use of ``one-of-a-
kind'' attachments.
    (f) Joint Proposals.
    (1) Where multiple organizations are involved, the proposal may be 
submitted by only one of them. It should clearly describe the role to be 
played by the other organizations and indicate the legal and managerial 
arrangements contemplated. In other instances, simultaneous submission 
of related proposals from each organization might be appropriate, in 
which case parallel awards would be made.
    (2) Where a project of a cooperative nature with NASA is 
contemplated, describe the contributions expected from any participating 
NASA investigator and agency facilities or equipment which may be 
required. The proposal must be confined only to that which the proposing 
organization can commit itself. ``Joint'' proposals which specify the 
internal arrangements NASA will actually make are not acceptable as a 
means of establishing an agency commitment.
    (g) Late Proposals. A proposal or modification received after the 
date or dates specified in an NRA may be considered if doing so is in 
the best interests of the Government.
    (h) Withdrawal. Proposals may be withdrawn by the proposer at any 
time before award. Offerors are requested to notify NASA if the proposal 
is funded by another organization or of other changed circumstances 
which dictate termination of evaluation.
    (i) Evaluation Factors
    (1) Unless otherwise specified in the NRA, the principal elements 
(of approximately equal weight) considered in evaluating a proposal are 
its relevance to NASA's objectives, intrinsic merit, and cost.
    (2) Evaluation of a proposal's relevance to NASA's objectives 
includes the consideration of the potential contribution of the effort 
to NASA's mission.
    (3) Evaluation of its intrinsic merit includes the consideration of 
the following factors of equal importance:
    (i) Overall scientific or technical merit of the proposal or unique 
and innovative methods, approaches, or concepts demonstrated by the 
proposal.

[[Page 394]]

    (ii) Offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, 
techniques, or unique combinations of these which are integral factors 
for achieving the proposal objectives.
    (iii) The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the 
proposed principal investigator, team leader, or key personnel critical 
in achieving the proposal objectives.
    (iv) Overall standing among similar proposals and/or evaluation 
against the state-of-the-art.
    (4) Evaluation of the cost of a proposed effort may include the 
realism and reasonableness of the proposed cost and available funds.
    (j) Evaluation Techniques. Selection decisions will be made 
following peer and/or scientific review of the proposals. Several 
evaluation techniques are regularly used within NASA. In all cases 
proposals are subject to scientific review by discipline specialists in 
the area of the proposal. Some proposals are reviewed entirely in-house, 
others are evaluated by a combination of in-house and selected external 
reviewers, while yet others are subject to the full external peer review 
technique (with due regard for conflict-of-interest and protection of 
proposal information), such as by mail or through assembled panels. The 
final decisions are made by a NASA selecting official. A proposal which 
is scientifically and programmatically meritorious, but not selected for 
award during its initial review, may be included in subsequent reviews 
unless the proposer requests otherwise.
    (k) Selection for Award.
    (1) When a proposal is not selected for award, the proposer will be 
notified. NASA will explain generally why the proposal was not selected. 
Proposers desiring additional information may contact the selecting 
official who will arrange a debriefing.
    (2) When a proposal is selected for award, negotiation and award 
will be handled by the procurement office in the funding installation. 
The proposal is used as the basis for negotiation. The contracting 
officer may request certain business data and may forward a model award 
instrument and other information pertinent to negotiation.
    (l) Cancellation of NRA. NASA reserves the right to make no awards 
under this NRA and to cancel this NRA. NASA assumes no liability for 
canceling the NRA or for anyone's failure to receive actual notice of 
cancellation.

1852.236-71  Additive or deductive items.

    As prescribed in 1836.570(a), insert the following provision:

                 Additive or Deductive Items (Mar 1989)

    (a) The low bidder for purposes of award shall be the conforming 
responsible bidder offering the low aggregate amount for the first or 
base bid item, plus or minus (in order of priority listed in the 
Schedule) those additive or deductive bid items providing the most 
features of the work within the funds determined by the Government to be 
available before bids are opened. If addition of another bid item in the 
listed order of priority would make the award exceed those funds for all 
bidders, it shall be skipped and the next subsequent additive bid item 
in a lower amount shall be added for each bid if award on it can be made 
within the funds.
    (b) An example for one bid is an amount available of $100,000, a 
bidder's base bid of $85,000, and four successive additives of $10,000, 
$8,000, $6,000, and $4,000. In this example, the aggregate amount of the 
bid for purposes of award would be $99,000 for the base bid plus the 
first and fourth additives, the second and third additives being skipped 
because either of them would cause the aggregate bid to exceed $100,000.
    (c) All bids shall be evaluated on the basis of the same additive or 
deductive bid items. The listed order of priority must be followed only 
for determining the low bidder. After determination of the low bidder, 
award in the best interests of the Government may be made to that bidder 
on its base bid and any combination of its additive or deductive bid 
items for which funds are determined to be available at the time of the 
award, provided that award of the combination of bid items does not 
exceed the amount offered by any other conforming responsible bidder for 
the same combination of bid items.

    (a) All extensions of the unit prices bid will be subject to 
verification by the Government. If there is variation between the unit 
price and any extended amounts, the unit price will be considered to be 
the bid.
    (b) If a modification to a bid based on unit prices that provides 
for a lump-sum adjustment to the total estimated cost is submitted, the 
application of the lump sum adjustment to each unit price in the bid 
must be stated. If it is not stated, the lump-sum adjustment shall be 
applied on a pro rata basis to every unit price in the bid.

1852.237-72  Identification of uncompensated overtime.

    As prescribed in 1837.110-70(c), insert the following provision:

         Identification of Uncompensated Overtime, January 1997

    The use of uncompensated overtime is neither encouraged nor 
discouraged. When the proposed uncompensated overtime is consistent with 
an officer's written policies and practices, NASA will consider it in 
proposal evaluation, including the evaluation of cost and of 
professional compensation.
    (a) Definitions. As used in this provision:
    ``Uncompensated overtime'' means the hours worked in excess of an 
average of 40 hours per week, by direct charge employees who are exempt 
from the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) without additional 
compensation. Compensated personal absences, such as holidays, 
vacations, and sick leave shall be included in the normal work week for 
purposes of computing uncompensated overtime hours.
    ``Effective hourly rate'' is the rate that results from multiplying 
the hourly rate for a 40-hour work week by 40, and then dividing by the 
proposed hours per week. For example, 45 hours proposed on a 40-hour 
work seek basis at $20.00 per hour would be converted to an effective 
hourly rate of $17.78 per hour [($20.00 x 40) divided by 45=$17.78].
    (b) For any hours proposed against which an effective hourly rate is 
applied, the Offeror shall identify in its proposal the hours in excess 
of an average of 40 hours per week, at the same level of detail as 
compensated hours, and the effective hourly rate, whether at the prime 
or subcontract level. This includes uncompensated overtime hours that 
are in indirect cost pools for personnel whose regular hours are 
normally charged direct. The proposal shall include the rationale and 
methodology used to estimate the proposed amount of uncompensated 
overtime.
    (c) The Offeror's accounting practices used to estimate 
uncompensated overtime must be consistent with its cost accounting 
practices used to accumulate and report uncompensated overtime hours.
    (d) The Offeror shall include with its proposal a copy of its policy 
addressing uncompensated overtime, a description of the timekeeping and 
accounting systems used to record all hours worked by FLSA-exempt 
employees, and the historical basis for the uncompensated overtime hours 
proposed.

                  Alternate Delivery Points (Nov 1993)

    (a) The first priority of this contract is to satisfy the 
anticipated requirements of ____ (identify contracting activity). 
However, should the actual requirements of ____ (contracting activity) 
be less than the maximum quantities/values specified in section B of 
this contract, ____ (contracting activity) may order the remaining 
available quantities/values to satisfy the requirements of other 
installations. The other installations at which delivery may be required 
are:

(List installations and their locations)

    (b) The prices of the deliverables in section B are F.O.B.

    (a) Performance of the work under this contract is subject to the 
written technical direction of the Contracting Officer Technical 
Representative (COTR), who shall be specifically appointed by the 
Contracting Officer in writing in accordance with NASA FAR Supplement 
1842.270. ``Technical direction'' means a directive to the Contractor 
that approves approaches, solutions, designs, or refinements; fills in 
details or otherwise completes the general description of work or 
documentation items; shifts emphasis among work areas or tasks; or 
furnishes similar instruction to the Contractor. Technical direction 
includes requiring studies and pursuit of certain lines of inquiry 
regarding matters within the general tasks and requirements in Section C 
of this contract.
    (b) The COTR does not have the authority to, and shall not, issue 
any instruction purporting to be technical direction that--
    (1) Constitutes an assignment of additional work outside the 
statement of work;
    (2) Constitutes a change as defined in the changes clause;
    (3) Constitutes a basis for any increase or decrease in the total 
estimated contract cost, the fixed fee (if any), or the time required 
for contract performance;
    (4) Changes any of the expressed terms, conditions, or 
specifications of the contract; or
    (5) Interferes with the contractor's rights to perform the terms and 
conditions of the contract.
    (c) All technical direction shall be issued in writing by the COTR.
    (d) The Contractor shall proceed promptly with the performance of 
technical direction duly issued by the COTR in the manner prescribed by 
this clause and within the COTR's authority. If, in the Contractor's 
opinion, any instruction or direction by the COTR falls within any of 
the categories defined in paragraph (b) of this clause, the Contractor 
shall not proceed but shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing 
within 5 working days after receiving it and shall request the 
Contracting Officer to take action as described in this clause. Upon 
receiving this notification, the Contracting Officer shall either issue 
an appropriate contract modification within a reasonable time or advise 
the Contractor in writing within 30 days that the instruction or 
direction is--
    (1) Rescinded in its entirety; or
    (2) Within the requirements of the contract and does not constitute 
a change under the Changes clause of the contract, and that the 
Contractor should proceed promptly with its performance.
    (e) A failure of the Contractor and the Contracting Officer to agree 
that the instruction or direction is both within the requirements of the 
contract and does not constitute a change under the Changes clause, or a 
failure to agree upon the contract action to be taken with respect to 
the instruction or direction, shall be subject to the Disputes clause of 
this contract.
    (f) Any action(s) taken by the contractor in response to any 
direction given by any person other than the Contracting Officer or the 
COTR shall be at the Contractor's risk.

site personnel to perform round-the-clock requirements of critical work 
already in process, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting 
Officer or authorized representative. If the Contractor's on-site 
personnel work during a holiday other than those in paragraph (a) of the 
clause, no form of holiday or other premium compensation shall be 
reimbursed as either a direct or indirect cost. However, this does not 
preclude reimbursement for authorized overtime work that would have been 
overtime regardless of the status of the day as a holiday.
    (d) The Contractor shall place identical requirements, including 
this paragraph, in all subcontracts that require performance of work on-
site, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

(f):
    (e) When the NASA installation grants administrative leave to its 
Government employees (e.g., as a result of inclement weather, 
potentially hazardous conditions, or other special circumstances), 
Contractor personnel working on-site should also be dismissed. However, 
the contractor shall provide sufficient onsite personnel to perform 
round-the-clock requirements of critical work already in process, unless 
otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer or authorized 
representative.
    (f) Whenever administrative leave is granted to Contractor personnel 
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this clause, it shall be without loss to 
the Contractor. The cost of salaries and wages to the Contractor for the 
period of any such excused absence shall be a reimbursable item of cost 
under this contract for employees in accordance with the Contractor's 
established accounting policy.

modified to suit contract type:

                 ENGINEERING CHANGE PROPOSALS (MAR 1997)

    (a) Definitions.
    ECP means an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) which is a proposed 
engineering change and the documentation by which the change is 
described, justified, and submitted to the procuring activity for 
approval or disapproval.
    MIL-STD-973 means a DOD publication entitled, Military Standard 
Configuration Control--Egnineering Changes, Deviations and Waivers, 15 
July 1988.
    (b) Either party to the contract may originate ECPs. The originator 
shall forward proposed ECPs to the Contracting Officer. Unless another 
process has been approved by the Government or specified by the 
Contracting Officer, the ECP formats, forms and controls specified in 
MIL-STD-973 shall be used. Implementation of an approved ECP may occur 
by either a supplemental agreement or, if appropriate, as a written 
change order to the contract.
    (c) Any ECP submitted to the Contracting Officer shall include a 
``not-to-exceed'' ______ [price or estimated cost] increase or decrease 
adjustment amount, if any, and the required [time of delivery or period 
of performance] adjustment, if any, acceptable to the originator of the 
ECP. If the change is originated within the Government, the Contracting 
Officer shall obtain a written agreement with the Contractor regarding 
the ``not-to-exceed'' ______ [price or estimated cost] and [delivery or 
period of performance] adjustments, if any, prior to issuing an order 
for implementation of the change.
    (d) After submission of a Contractor initiated ECP, the Contracting 
Officer may require the Contractor to submit the following information:
    (1) Cost or pricing data in accordance with FAR 15.804-6 if the 
proposed change meets the criteria for its submission under FAR 15.804-
2; or
    (2) Information other than cost or pricing data adequate for 
Contracting Officer determination of price reasonableness or cost 
realism. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to request 
additional information if that provided by the Contractor is considered 
inadequate for that purpose. If the Contractor claims applicability of 
one of the exceptions to submission of cost or pricing data, it shall 
cite the exception and provide rationale for its applicability.
    (e) If the ECP is initiated by NASA, the Contracting Officer shall 
specify the cost information requirements, if any.

1852.243-71  Shared savings.

    As prescribed in 1843.7102, insert the following clause:

                        SHARED SAVINGS (MAR 1997)

    (a) The Contractor is entitled, under the provisions of this clause, 
to share in cost savings resulting from the implementation of cost 
reduction projects which are presented to the Government in the form of 
Cost Reduction Proposals (CRP) and approved by the Contracting Officer. 
These cost reduction projects may require changes to the terms, 
conditions or statement of work of this contract. Any cost reduction 
projects must not change the essential function of any products to be 
delivered or the essential purpose of services to be provided under the 
contract.
    (b) Definitions:

[[Page 400]]

    (1) Cost savings, as contemplated by this clause mean savings that 
result from instituting changes to the covered contract, as identified 
in an approved Cost Reduction Proposal.
    (2) Cost Reduction Proposal--For the purposes of this clause, a Cost 
Reduction Proposal means a proposal that recommends alternatives to the 
established procedures and/or organizational support of a contract or 
group of contracts. These alternatives must result in a net reduction of 
contract cost and price to NASA. The proposal will include technical and 
cost information sufficient to enable the Contracting Officer to 
evaluate the CRP and approve or disapprove it.
    (3) Covered contract--As used in this provision, covered contract 
means the contract, including unexercised options but excluding future 
contracts, whether contemplated or not, against which the CRP is 
submitted.
    (4) Contractor implementation costs--As used in this provision, 
Contractor implementation costs, or ``implementation costs'', shall mean 
those costs which the Contractor incurs on covered contracts 
specifically in developing, preparing, submitting, and negotiating a 
CRP, as well as those costs the Contractor will incur on covered 
contracts to make any structural or organizational changes in order to 
implement an approved CRP.
    (5) Government costs--As used in this provision, the term Government 
costs means internal costs of NASA, or any other Government agency, 
which result directly from development and implementation of the CRP. 
These may include, but are not limited to, costs associated with the 
administration of the contract or with such contractually related 
functions such as testing, operations, maintenance and logistics 
support. These costs also include costs associated with other Agency 
contracts (including changes in contract price or cost and fee) that may 
be affected as a result of the implementation of a CRP. They do not 
include the normal administrative costs of reviewing and processing the 
Cost Reduction Proposal.
    (c) General. The Contractor will develop, prepare and submit CRP's 
with supporting information as detailed in paragraph (e) of this clause, 
to the Contracting Officer. The CRP will describe the proposed cost 
reduction activity in sufficient detail to enable the Contracting 
Officer to evaluate it and to approve or disapprove it. The Contractor 
shall share in any net cost savings realized from approved and 
implemented CRPs in accordance with the terms of this clause. The 
Contractor's actual percentage share of the cost savings shall be a 
matter for negotiation with the Contracting Officer, but shall not, in 
any event, exceed 50 percent of the total cost savings recognized by the 
Contracting Officer. The Contractor may propose changes in other 
activities that impact performance on its contract, including Government 
and other Contractor operations, if such changes will optimize cost 
savings. A Contractor shall not be entitled to share, however, in any 
cost savings that are internal to the Government, or which result from 
changes made to any contracts to which it is not a party even if those 
changes were proposed as a part of its CRP. Early communication between 
the Contractor and Government is encouraged. The communication may be in 
the form of a concept paper or preliminary proposal. The Government is 
not committed to accepting any proposal as a result of these early 
discussions.
    (d) Computation of cost savings. The cost savings to be shared 
between the Government and the Contractor will be computed by the 
Contracting Officer by comparing a current estimate to complete (ETC) 
for the covered contract, as structured before implementation of the 
proposed CRP, to a revised ETC which takes into account the 
implementation of that CRP. The cost savings to be shared shall be 
reduced by any cost overrun, whether experienced or projected, that is 
identified on the covered contract before implementation of the CRP. 
Although a CRP may result in cost savings that extend far into the 
future, the period in which the Contractor may share in those savings 
will be limited to no more than five years. Implementation costs of the 
Contractor must be considered and specifically identified in the revised 
ETC. The Contracting Officer shall offset Contractor cost savings by any 
increased costs (whether implementing or recurring) to the Government 
when computing the total cost savings to be shared. The Contractor shall 
not be entitled, under the provisions of this clause, to share in any 
cost reductions to the contract that are the result of changes stemming 
from any action other than an approved CRP. However, this clause does 
not limit recovery of any such reimbursements that are allowed as a 
result of other contract provisions.
    (e) Supporting Information. As a minimum, the Contractor shall 
provide the following supporting information with each CRP:
    (1) Identification of the current contract requirements or 
established procedures and/or organizational support which are proposed 
to be changed.
    (2) A description of the difference between the current process or 
procedure and the proposed change. This description shall address how 
proposed changes will meet NASA requirements and discuss the advantages 
and disadvantages of the existing practice and the proposed changes.
    (3) A list of contract requirements which must be revised, if any, 
if the CRP is approved, along with proposed revisions. Any changes to 
NASA or delegated contract management processes should also be 
addressed.

[[Page 401]]

    (4) Detailed cost estimates which reflect the implementation costs 
of the CRP.
    (5) An updated ETC for the covered contract, unchanged, and a 
revised ETC for the covered contract which reflects changes resulting 
from implementing the CRP. If the CRP proposes changes to only a limited 
number of elements of the contract, the ETCs need only address those 
portions of the contract that have been impacted. Each ETC shall depict 
the level of costs incurred or to be incurred by year, or to the level 
of detail required by the Contracting Officer. If other CRPs have been 
proposed or approved on a contract, the impact of these CRPs must be 
addressed in the computation of the cost savings to ensure that the cost 
savings identified are attributable only to the CRP under consideration 
in the instant case.
    (6) Identification of any other previous submissions of the CRP, 
including the dates submitted, the agencies and contracts involved, and 
the disposition of those submittals.
    (f) Administration.
    (1) The Contractor shall submit proposed CRPs to the Contracting 
Officer who shall be responsible for the review, evaluation and 
approval. Normally, CRP's should not be entertained for the first year 
of performance to allow the Contracting Officer to assess performance 
against the basic requirements. If a cost reduction project impacts more 
than a single contract, the Contractor may, upon concurrence of the 
Contracting Officers responsible for the affected contracts, submit a 
single CRP which addresses fully the cost savings projected on all 
affected contracts that contain this Shared Savings Clause. In the case 
of multiple contracts affected, responsibility for the review and 
approval of the CRP will be a matter to be decided by the affected 
Contracting Officers.
    (2) Within 60 days of receipt, the Contracting Officer shall 
complete an initial evaluation of any proposed cost reduction plan to 
determine its feasibility. Failure of the Contracting Officer to provide 
a response within 60 days shall not be construed as approval of the CRP. 
The Government shall promptly notify the Contractor of the results of 
its initial evaluation and indicate what, if any, further action will be 
taken. If the Government determines that the proposed CRP has merit, it 
will open discussions with the Contractor to establish the cost savings 
to be recognized, the Contractor's share of the cost savings, and a 
payment schedule. The Contractor shall continue to perform in accordance 
with the terms and conditions of the existing contract until a contract 
modification is executed by the Contracting Officer. The modification 
shall constitute approval of the CRP and shall incorporate the changes 
identified by the CRP, adjust the contract cost and/or price, establish 
the Contractor's share of cost savings, and incorporate the agreed to 
payment schedule.
    (3) The Contractor will receive payment by submitting invoices to 
the Contracting Officer for approval. The amount and timing of 
individual payments will be made in accordance with the schedule to be 
established with the Contracting Officer. Notwithstanding the overall 
savings recognized by the Contracting Officer as a result of an approved 
CRP, payment of any portion of the Contractor's share of savings shall 
not be made until NASA begins to realize a net cost savings on the 
contract (i.e., implementation, startup and other increased costs 
resulting from the change have been offset by cumulative cost savings). 
Savings associated with unexercised options will not be paid unless and 
until the contract options are exercised. It shall be the responsibility 
of the Contractor to provide such justification as the Contracting 
Officer deems necessary to substantiate that cost savings are being 
achieved.
    (4) Any future activity, including a merger or acquisition 
undertaken by the Contractor (or to which the Contractor becomes an 
involved party), which has the effect of reducing or reversing the cost 
savings realized from an approved CRP for which the Contractor has 
received payment may be cause for recomputing the net cost savings 
associated with any approved CRP. The Government reserves the right to 
make an adjustment to the Contractor's share of cost savings and to 
receive a refund of moneys paid if necessary. Such adjustment shall not 
be made without notifying the Contractor in advance of the intended 
action and affording the Contractor an opportunity for discussion.
    (g) Limitations. Contract requirements that are imposed by statute 
shall not be targeted for cost reduction exercises. The Contractor is 
precluded from receiving reimbursements under both this clause and other 
incentive provisions of the contract, if any, for the same cost 
reductions.
    (h) Disapproval of, or failure to approve, any proposed cost 
reduction proposal shall not be considered a dispute subject to remedies 
under the Disputes clause.
    (i) Cost savings paid to the Contractor in accordance with the 
provisions of this clause do not constitute profit or fee within the 
limitations imposed by 10 U.S.C. 2306(d) and 41 U.S.C. 254(b).

      Contractor Requests for Government-Owned Equipment (JUL 1997)

    (a) ``Equipment,'' as used in this clause, means commercially 
available items capable of stand-alone use, including those to be 
acquired for incorporation into special test equipment or special 
tooling.
    (b)(1) Upon determination of need for any Government-owned equipment 
item for performance of this contract, the contractor shall provide to 
the contracting officer a written request justifying the need for the 
equipment and the reasons why contractor-owned property cannot be used, 
citing the applicable FAR or contract authority for use of Government-
owned equipment. Equipment being acquired as a deliverable end item 
listed in the contract or as a component for incorporation into a 
deliverable end item listed in the contract is exempt from this 
requirement.
    (2) The contractor's request shall include a description of the item 
in sufficient detail to enable the Government to screen its inventories 
for available equipment or to purchase equipment. For this purpose, the 
contractor shall (i) prepare a separate DD Form 1419, DOD Industrial 
Plant Equipment Requisition, or equivalent format, for each item 
requested and (ii) forward it through the contracting officer to the 
Industrial Property Officer at the cognizant NASA installation at least 
30 days in advance of the date the contractor intends to acquire the

due. Such reserve shall be withheld until the Contracting Officer has 
determined that the required reports have been received by the

the determination, the Contractor agrees not to appoint the employee to 
the position, or if already appointed, to promptly remove the employee.

of which is greater than the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT) (FAR 
part 13) and not more than $2,000,000 in basic value (not more than 
$10,000,000 with options) and for commercial items (FAR part 12) not 
more than $25,000,000 including options. This part may be used for 
commercial item contracts above $25,000,000 at the installation's 
discretion.

[[Page 414]]

    (c) For other than commercial items, if the Government estimate for 
the basic award amount or any option amount, if any, exceeds the limits 
of 1871.103(b), the procurement will be processed under FAR and NFS 
procurement procedures applicable to large procurements (see FAR parts 
14 and 15). When the estimate is within the range of 1871.103(b) and the 
procurement was started using these procedures but the offered prices/
costs exceed the MidRange ceiling, the procurement may continue under 
MidRange procedures, provided that:
    (1) The price/cost can be determined to be fair and reasonable,
    (2) The successful offeror accepts incorporation of required FAR and 
NFS clauses applicable to large procurements, and
    (3) The procurement does not exceed $3,000,000 for the basic 
requirement or $15,000,000 for the total requirement.

<R04>
            Subpart 1871.2--Planning and Requirements Process


<R05>
1871.201  Use of buying team.

    MidRange procedures are based on the use of a buying team to conduct 
the procurement. The concept is to designate individuals who are 
competent in their respective functional areas, provide those 
individuals with the basic authority to conduct the procurement and hold 
them accountable for the results. The buying team will normally consist 
of one technical member and one procurement member, but may be augmented 
with additional members

[[Page 415]]

as necessary, Personnel providing normal functional assistance to the 
team (e.g., legal, financial) will not be considered a part of the team 
unless so designated. To function properly, the team should be given the 
maximum decision authority in matters related to the procurement. When 
higher level management approvals remain essential, it will be incumbent 
upon the functional team member to obtain such approvals.


<R05>
1871.202  Organizatonal responsibilities.


<R05>
1871.202-1  Requiring organization.

    The requirements organization shall appoint, by name, the technical 
member of the buying team. This individual will normally be an end user 
or the one most familiar with the technical aspects of the requirement. 
The individual appointed, whatever the relationship with the procured 
item, is expected to totally fulfill the responsibilities to the buying 
team.


<R05>
1871.202-2  Procurement organization.

    The procurement organization shall appoint the procurement member of 
the buying team. This individual shall be a warranted contracting 
officer or a contract specialist with broad latitude to act for the 
contracting officer. The procurement member shall be the team leader 
with the ultimate responsibility to conduct the procurement.


<R05>
1871.202-3  Supporting organizations.

    Buying team members may require additional team members to perform 
specialized functions or to assist in the evaluation of offers. Requests 
for supporting members shall be made by the organization identifying the 
need for the support and directed to the appropriate management level in 
the supporting organization. Supporting team members, once designated 
for the team, shall fulfill all applicable responsibilities to the team 
as other members.


<R05>
1871.202-4  Center management.

    Center managers shall, to the maximum extent practical and 
consistent with their responsibilities to manage the Center mission, 
convey sufficient authority to members of the buying team to conduct the 
procurement. Administrative or technical approvals should be minimized, 
and where deemed essential, facilitated to the maximum extent 
practicable. Center managers should lend their full support to the 
buying team should problems arise from the procurement.


<R05>
1871.203  Buying team responsibilities.

    (a) The buying team shall conduct the procurement in a manner that 
best satisfies the user requirements and meets the norms expected of a 
Government procurement. Team members should develop open communications, 
rely on decisions of other responsible functional team members and meet 
their obligations to the team. The team will typically--
    (1) Refine the final specifications for the solicitation;
    (2) Decide the most appropriate solicitation method;
    (3) Establish milestones for the procurement;
    (4) Finalize the evaluation criteria;
    (5) Develop the RFO and model contract; and
    (6) Evaluate offers and determine the awardee.
    (b) The procurement member of the buying team shall lead 
clarifications, discussions, and negotiations; shall be the source 
selection official; and shall conduct debriefings.


<R05>
1871.204  Small business set-asides.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this 
section, each MidRange acquisition shall be reserved exclusively for 
small business concerns.
    (b) The requirment for small business MidRange set-asides does not 
relieve the buying office of its responsibility to procure from required 
sources of supply, such as Federal Prison Industries, Industries for the 
Blind and Other Severely handicapped, and multiple award Federal Supply 
Schedule contracts.
    (c) Procurements not conducted as small business set-asides and 
under less than full and open competition require a Justification for 
Other than Full and Open Competition pursuant to FAR part 6.

[[Page 416]]

    (d) If the buying team procurement member determines there is no 
reasonable expectation of obtaining offers from two or more responsible 
small business concerns that will be competitive in terms of market 
price, quality, and delivery, the buying team need not proceed with the 
small business set-aside and may purchase on an unrestricted basis 
utilizing MidRange procedures. The buying team procurement member shall 
document the contract file with the reason for the unrestricted 
procurement.
    (e) If the buying team proceeds with the small business MidRange 
set-aside and receives an offer from only one responsible small business 
concern at a reasonable price, the contracting officer will normally 
make an award to that concern. However, if the buying team does not 
receive a reasonable offer from a responsible small business concern, 
the buying team procurement member may cancel the small business set-
aside and complete the procurement on an unrestricted basis utilizing 
MidRange procedures. The buying team procurement members shall document 
in the file the reason for the unrestricted purchase.
    (f) Each model contract under a small business MidRange set-aside 
shall contain the clause at FAR 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business 
Set-Aside.


<R04>
               Subpart 1871.3--Publicizing of Solicitation


<R05>
1871.301   Publicizing policy.

    (a) Use of the MidRange procedure is intended to streamline and 
expedite the acquisition process. Publication requirements for synopses 
are streamlined; however, it is in the Government's interest to provide 
as much advance notice as possible of a pending acquisition in order for 
the Government to obtain maximum competition.
    (b) The dollar thresholds stated in 1871.302 are lower than the 
MidRange thresholds in 1871.103. They are based on Section 5062 of the 
Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act.


<R05>
1871.302   Publicizing procedure.

    (a) Synopses are not to be sent to or published in the Commerce 
Business Daily except if the basic award is expected to exceed $500,000, 
the total amount of the basic award plus options is expected to exceed 
$2,500,000, or annual obligations are expected to exceed $500,000 in any 
one year. For those acquisitions published both in the CBD and on the 
NAIS, the CBD publication date is the basis upon which the time frames 
specified in FAR 5.203 are calculated.
    (b) A synopsis for each requirement shall be published on the NAIS 
prior to or simultaneously with the actual release of the solicitation.
    (c) The synopsis shall comply with the requirements set forth in FAR 
5.207(b) and shall:
    (1) Include a statement that the competitive solicitation will be 
released via the NAIS, that potential offerors will be responsible for 
downloading their own copy of the solicitation, and that hard copies of 
the solicitation will not be mailed, and
    (2) State the projected solicitation release date if the synopsis is 
published prior to solicitation release, provide notice that it is the 
offeror's responsibility to monitor the NAIS for solicitation release as 
the solicitation will be released as soon as practicable whether prior 
or subsequent to the projected date, and identify the name, telephone 
number, fax number, and e-mail address of a point of contact. The 
synopsis shall be updated to reflect significant changes to the original 
notice.
    (d) For commercial item purchases, the streamlined solicitation 
(combined presolicitation notice and solicitation described in FAR part 
12) may be used.


<R05>
1871.303   Special situations.

    Notices for special situations as described in FAR 5.205 involving 
MidRange Procurements must be published in the Commerce Business Daily. 
Such special situations include R&D sources sought, intent to sponsor or 
change the mission of a Federally Funded Research and Development 
Center, effort to locate commercial sources under OMB Circular No. A-76, 
and Section 8(a) competitive national buy acquisitions.

[[Page 417]]


<R04>
                 Subpart 1871.4--Request for Offer (RFO)


<R05>
1871.400  General.

    In MidRange procedures, solicitation of sources shall be 
accomplished by use of an RFO. The RFO will be solely a solicitation 
document incorporating only those elements of information required to 
solicit the offer. Offers will be provided on a model contract furnished 
with the RFO.


<R05>
1871.401  Types of RFO'S.

    The RFO may be used for all types of procurements to which MidRange 
is applicable. The distinguishing difference will be the evaluation and 
award criteria specified in the RFO. This, in turn, will be driven by 
the buying team's decisions on the extent of discussion required, the 
amount of non-price factors that will influence the award and the amount 
of competition available. If the conditions in FAR 6.401(a) are met, the 
RFO's described in 1871.401-1 and 1871.401-2 shall be used; otherwise, 
RFO's described in 1871.401-3, 1871.401-4, 1871.401-5, or 1871.401-6 may 
be used. Once the evaluation and award criteria have been specified in 
the RFO, the procurement must conform to the procedures applicable to 
these criteria, unless changed by formal amendment to the RFO.


<R05>
1871.401-1  Sealed offers.

    (a) Policy. RFO's may specify that award will be made to the low, 
responsive, responsible offeror providing the most advantageous offer 
considering only price and price-related factors. This method shall be 
used when (1) time permits the solicitation, submission, and evaluation 
of sealed offers; (2) award will be made on the basis of price and other 
price-related factors; (3) conducting discussions with the offerors is 
not necessary; and (4) a reasonable expectation of receiving more than 
one offer exists. The RFO shall be in compliance with the requirements 
of FAR part 14 relating to Sealed Bidding.
    (b) Procedures. (1) The RFO shall request offerors to provide a 
complete offer by the closing date specified.
    (2) In accordance with FAR part 14, offers (whether received by 
facsimile or sealed envelope delivery) shall be publicly opened at the 
designated time and place. Interested members of the public will be 
permitted to attend the opening. Offers shall be abstracted pursuant to 
FAR part 14 and be available for public inspection. The abstract shall 
be included in the contract file.
    (3) All offers shall be examined for mistakes in accordance with FAR 
14.406. The buying team shall determine that a prospective contractor is 
responsible and that the prices offered are reasonable (see FAR 14.407-
2).
    (4) The Government will award a contract to the low, responsive, 
responsible offeror, whose offer conforms to the RFO and will be most 
advantageous to the Government, considering only price and the price-
related factors included in the solicitation.


<R05>
1871.401-2  Two-step competitive procurement.

    (a) Policy. (1) RFO's may specify that evaluation and award may be 
conducted in two distinct steps, similar in concept to ``Two Step Sealed 
Bidding.'' The MidRange Two Step process should be used when it is 
desirable to award to the lowest, responsive, responsible offeror after 
determining that the initial technical offer, or the revised technical 
offer, is acceptable.
    (2) The procedures of FAR 14.503-2(a) shall be used once Step Two of 
this process begins.
    (b) Procedures. (1) The RFO shall request offerors to provide both a 
technical and a price offer by the closing date specified. Price offers 
are requested to ensure that they are accomplished in a timely manner 
and to reduce the time required for Step Two.
    (2) Step One. The technical offer will be evaluated to determine if 
the product or service offered is acceptable. The buying team may 
proceed directly to Step Two if there are sufficient acceptable offers 
to ensure adequate price competition, and if further time, effort and 
delay to make additional offers acceptable and thereby increase 
competition would not be in the Government's interest. If this is not 
the case, the buying team procurement member shall enter into 
discussions and request offeror(s) whose offer(s) is susceptible to 
being made acceptable to submit additional clarifying or

[[Page 418]]

supplementing information to make it acceptable (see FAR 14.503-1). It 
is expected that these discussions will be conducted on an informal 
basis. After completion of discussions, the buying team shall proceed to 
Step Two.
    (3) Step Two. If discussions were held, the buying team shall afford 
all offerors who have submitted acceptable offers and those offers with 
whom discussions were conducted, an opportunity, by a common date, to 
revise their price offers. No changes to technical offers will be 
permitted during this process. A reasonable amount of time (normally 
less than 5 working days) will be afforded for the revision. The amount 
of time given shall be the same for each offeror. The procedures at 
1871.401-1(b) (2) and (3) shall then be followed.
    (4) The Government will award a contract to the low, responsive, 
responsible offeror, whose offer conforms to the RFO and will be most 
advantageous to the Government, considering only price and the price-
related factors included in the solicitation.


<R05>
1871.401-3  Competitive negotiated procurement not using qualitative criteria.

    (a) Policy. (1) RFO's may provide for discussion of all aspects of 
the offer but award is based on the technically acceptable offer having 
the lowest price (if fixed price) or the lowest most probable cost (if 
cost reimbursable). This method should be used when qualitative factors 
are not material in the award decision, but it is important to assure 
that technical offers and contract terms are fully compliant with the 
Government's needs. This method also permits direct discussion of price 
with offerors and is particularly appropriate when different approaches 
can be offered to satisfy the Government's need.
    (2) The RFO should reserve the right to award without discussion 
based on the initial offers submitted. FAR 52.215-16, Alternate II, will 
be included in all RFO's for competitive negotiated procurements not 
using qualitative criteria except for solicitations for commercial item 
acquisitions.
    (b) Procedures. (1) The RFO shall request offerors to provide both a 
technical and a price offer by the closing date specified.
    (2) Initial evaluation. The buying team shall review each offer to 
determine if all required information has been provided. No further 
evaluation shall be made of any offer that is deemed unacceptable 
because it does not meet the technical requirements of the RFO and is 
not reasonably susceptible to being made so. Offerors may be contacted 
for clarification purposes only during the initial evaluation. Offerors 
determined not to be acceptable shall be notified of their rejection and 
the reasons therefore and excluded from further consideration. 
Documentation for such rejection should consist of one or more succinct 
statements of fact that show the offer is not acceptable. No 
documentation is required if all offers are deemed to be acceptable or 
reasonably susceptible to being made so.
    (3) Determination of finalists. From among the acceptable offers and 
those susceptible to being made acceptable, the buying team shall rank 
the offers based on price (or most probable cost) and exclude any whose 
price/most probable cost precludes any reasonable chance of being 
selected for final award. The remaining offers constitute the 
``finalists'' for the contract. Only in exceptional cases will this 
number be less than two offers. The procurement buying team member shall 
succinctly record the basis for the decision.
    (4) Discussions. The procurement buying team member shall lead 
discussions with each finalist. The discussions are intended to assist 
the buying team in fully understanding each finalist's offer and to 
assure that all finalists are competing equally on the basis intended. 
Care must be exercised to ensure these discussions adhere, to the extent 
applicable, to the guidelines set forth in FAR 15.610. It is expected 
that discussions will be conducted on an informal basis with each 
finalist. After completion of discussions, each finalist shall be 
afforded an opportunity to revise its offer to support and clarify its 
offer. A reasonable amount of time (Normally less than 5 working days) 
will be afforded for the revision. The amount of time given shall be the 
same for each

[[Page 419]]

finalist. Such discussions are not required if there are sufficient 
acceptable offers to ensure adequate price competition, and if further 
time, effort and delay to make additional proposals acceptable and 
thereby increase competition, would not be in the Government's interest.
    (5) Selection. The procurement team member shall be the source 
selection official. The source selection official may elect to make 
selection in lieu of determining finalists provided that it can be 
demonstrated that (i) selection of an initial offer(s) will result in 
the lowest price/cost to the Government and (ii) discussions with other 
acceptable offerors are not anticipated to change the outcome of the 
initial evaluation relative to evaluated price/cost. It is expected that 
the source selection statement will not ordinarily exceed one page and 
that the basis for the decision will be apparent upon review of the 
informal worksheets used in the evaluation process. These informal 
worksheets shall be included in the contract file.
    (6) The names of offerors determined to be finalists or the name of 
the offeror selected for contract award will be electronically 
transmitted to all offerors. This will serve as notification to those 
offers that were not selected for further evaluation (see 1871.505).


<R05>
1871.401-4   Competitive negotiations using qualitative criteria (Best Value Selection).

    (a) Policy. (1) MidRange procurements shall normally use the BVS 
source selection method, prescribed in part 1871, subpart 1871.6, when 
it is desirable to base evaluation and award on a combination of price 
and non-price qualitative criteria.
    (2) The RFO should reserve the right to award without discussion 
based on the initial offers submitted. FAR 52.215-16, Alternate II, will 
be included in all RFO's for competitive negotiated procurements using 
qualitative criteria except for solicitations for commercial item 
acquisitions.
    (3) In exceptionally complex procurements, a source selection method 
other than MidRange Best Value Selection may be more appropriate. This 
may be appropriate in cases in which the following factors cannot be 
accommodated within the MidRange/BVS selection methodology:
    (i) The ability to predefine the value characteristics that will 
constitute the discriminators among the offers;
    (ii) The complexity of the interrelationships that must be 
evaluated;
    (iii) The number of evaluators required to address the disciplines 
that will be involved in the offers; or
    (iv) The impact that the procurement may have on higher level 
mission management (level of selection official) or future procurements.
    (b) Procedures. (1) The buying team will determine which of the 
source selection methodologies is most appropriate to the specific 
procurement.
    (2) The team shall record its rationale for selecting a methodology 
rather than BVS. Once this decision is made, the team shall no longer 
function as a MidRange buying team, but shall follow the instructions 
prescribed in the local procedures for the source selection method.


<R05>
1871.401-5  Noncompetitive negotiations.

    (a) Policy. (1) The RFO may be used as the solicitation method for 
noncompetitive procurements.
    (2) MidRange procedures may be used in noncompetitive acquisitions 
to the extent they are applicable.
    (b) Procedures. (1) Within the dollar thresholds specified in 
1871.302(a), posting a synopsis on the NAIS meets the requirement of FAR 
5.201 and complies with the notice required by the Competition in 
Contracting Act. A synopsis is not required if one of the exceptions of 
FAR 5.202 is met.
    (2) The buying team shall require submission of certified cost and 
pricing data in accordance with FAR 15.804-2.
    (3) The technical member of the buying team shall provide technical 
assistance to the procurement member during evaluation and negotiation 
of the contractor's offer.


<R05>
1871.401-6  Commercial items.

    (a) Policy. (1) MidRange procedures are considered consistent with 
the requirements of FAR part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. In the 
event of a

[[Page 420]]

conflict, however, FAR part 12 takes precedence.
    (2) MidRange Procedures shall be used for commercial item 
procurements except that type of contract is limited by FAR 12.207.
    (b) Procedures. The offices will be evaluated in accordance with 
applicable procedures, and shall include consideration of technical, 
past performance, and price.


<R05>
1871.402  Preparation of the RFO.

    (a) The RFO shall provide all standard information required for the 
offeror to submit an offer.
    (b) The RFO shall contain space for all necessary additional 
instructions to offerors. As a minimum, the RFO shall contain the 
following:
    (1) Incorporation by reference of all required standard provisions.
    (2) A provision notifying offerors that standard Representations and 
Certifications will be required.
    (3) Evaluation and award criteria.
    (4) A provision requiring offerors to submit offers on an attached 
model contract.
    (c) Requirements for the content and format of the offer should be 
the minimum required to provide for proper evaluation. Offerors' formats 
should be allowed to the maximum extent possible.
    (d) Facsimile offers, defined by FAR 14.202-7 and 15.402(i), are 
authorized for MidRange procurements.


<R05>
1871.403  Offer preparation period and limitations.

    For procurements which are synopsized solely on the NAIS, the buying 
team should establish deadlines for receipt of offers based on an 
assessment of the minimum amount of time required to respond to the 
solicitation. The time required will depend on the complexity of the 
requirement and amount of cost and technical information required to be 
submitted. The information required shall be limited to the amount 
required to conduct a proper evaluation. The offer preparation period 
established in the RFO shall not be less than 15 calendar days unless 
the procurement in urgent. For procurements which are synopsized on the 
NAIS and published in the CBD, FAR requirements for waiting times and 
deadlines for the receipt of offers apply.


<R05>
1870.404  Protection of offers.

    A facsimile machine(s) shall be dedicated for receipt of offers and 
placed in a secure location where offers received on it can be 
safeguarded. All offers submitted shall be recorded, sealed in an 
envelope marked with the RFO number and taken to the buying team 
procurement member. Facsimile attendants shall make a good faith effort 
to inspect the document for completeness and legibility. If the 
attendant believes there are missing or illegible pages, the document 
will be promptly referred to the buying team procurement member for 
notification to the offeror that it should resubmit the offer. The 
Government shall not assume responsibility for proper transmission.


<R05>
1871.405  RFO by NAIS (applicable to procurement meeting the thresholds in 1871.302(a)).

    (a) Competitive solicitations for MidRange Procurements shall be 
made available on the NAIS. Solicitations available on the NAIS are 
exempt from the requirement in FAR 14.203-1 that delivery of the 
solicitations be made pursuant to FAR 14.205.
    (b) For the purposes of FAR 15.402(a), a solicitation posted on the 
NAIS is a written solicitation.
    (c) Solicitations posted on the NAIS in accordance with the 
regulations in this part are exempt from the requirement in FAR 
15.408(a) to issue solicitations using the procedures in FAR part 5.


<R04>
                          Subpart 1871.5--Award


<R05>
1871.501  Representations and certifications.

    Upon determination of the successful offeror, the buying team 
procurement member will determine if the offeror has on file valid 
Representations and Certifications. If the offeror has not completed the 
required forms, or they have expired, the offeror will be requested to 
provide the forms promptly. Should the offeror refuse to provide the

[[Page 421]]

required Representations and Certifications or fail to meet a required 
condition, the buying team shall reject the offer and proceed to the 
next highest ranked offeror who is responsive and responsible.


<R05>
1871.502  Determination of responsible contractor.

    Contractor responsibility shall be determined in accordance with FAR 
part 9.


<R05>
1871.503  Negotiation documentation.

    The prenegotiation memorandum, if required, and the results of 
negotiation will be in abbreviated form and will be approved by the 
buying team.


<R05>
1871.504  Award documents.

    Contract award shall be accomplished by contracting officer 
execution of the contract document and providing a paper copy to the 
successful offeror. If facsimile documents were used in the evaluation 
process, the successful offeror may be required to execute original 
copies of the contract to facilitate legibility during the 
administration phase of the contract.


<R05>
1871.505  Notifications to unsuccessful offerors.

    For solicitations that were posted on the NAIS, a preaward notice 
shall be electronically transmitted to the offerors. This notice meets 
the requirements of FAR 15.1001. However, the preaward notice in a small 
business set-aside must allow unsuccessful offerors 5 working days to 
challenge the small business status of the successful offeror.


<R05>
1871.506  Publication of award.

    An award notice shall be posted on the NAIS for 7 calendar days 
after posting, if the contract offers subcontracting opportunities or if 
it is subject to the Trade Agreements Act. The information required by 
FAR 5.207 shall be included in the award notice in abbreviated form.


<R05>
1871.507  Debreifing of unsuccessful offerors.

    The procurement buying team member shall conduct debriefings if 
requested.


<R04>
                Subpart 1871.6--``Best Value Selection''


<R05>
1871.601  General.

    (a) Best Value Selection (BVS) seeks to select an offer based on the 
best combination of price and qualitative merit of the offers submitted 
and reduce the administrative burden on the offerors and the Government.
    (b) BVS takes advantage of the lower complexity of MidRange 
procurements and predefines the value characteristics which will serve 
as the discriminators among offers. It eliminates the use of area 
evaluation factors and the highly structured scoring.


<R05>
1871.602  Specifications for MidRange procurements.

    BVS refines the traditional approach to preparing specifications. 
BVS envisions that the requirement will focus on the end result that is 
to be achieved and will serve as a statement of the Government's 
baseline requirements. The offeror will be guided in meeting the 
Government's needs by a separate set of value characteristics which 
establish what the Government considers to be valuable in an offer. 
These value characteristics will be performance based and will permit 
the selection of the offer which provides better results for a 
reasonable marginal increase in price.


<R05>
1871.603  Establishment of evaluation criteria.

    (a) The requiring organization will provide, along with the 
requirement, a list of value characteristics against which the offers 
will be judged. There is no limit to the number or the type of 
characteristics that may be specified. The only standard will be whether 
the characteristic is rationally related to the need specified in the 
specification. Characteristics may include such factors as improved 
reliability, innovativeness of ideas, speed of service, demonstrated 
delivery performance, higher speeds, ease of use, qualifications of 
personnel, solutions to operating problems, level of service provided on 
previous similar contracts, or any of numerous other characteristics 
that may be of value to the Government in satisfying its needs.

[[Page 422]]

    (b) Cost and technical will be considered equal in importance. The 
value characteristics will not be assigned weights.
    (c) All subsequent evaluations will consider these characteristics 
when determining the finalists or making the final selection for award.


<R05>
1871.604  Evaluation phases.


<R05>
1871.604-1  Initial evaluation.

    (a) Offers will be reviewed to determine if all required information 
has been provided and the offeror has made a reasonable attempt to 
present an acceptable offer. Offerors may be contacted only for 
clarification purposes during the initial evaluation. No further 
evaluation shall be made of any offer that is deemed unacceptable 
because:
    (1) It does not represent a reasonable effort to address itself to 
the essential requirements of the RFO or clearly demonstrates that the 
offeror does not understand the requirements of the RFO;
    (2) It contains major technical or business deficiencies or 
omissions or out-of-line costs which discussions with the offeror could 
not reasonably be expected to cure; or
    (3) In R&D procurement, a substantial design drawback is evident in 
the offer and sufficient correction or improvement to consider the offer 
acceptable would require virtually an entirely new offer.
    (b) Offerors determined not to be acceptable shall be notified of 
their rejection and the reasons therefor and excluded from further 
consideration.
    (c) Documentation. If it is concluded that all offers are 
acceptable, then no documentation is required and evaluation proceeds. 
If one or more offers are not acceptable, the procurement member of the 
team will notify the offeror of the rejection and the reasons therefor. 
The documentation should consist of one or more succinct statements of 
fact that show the offer is not acceptable.


<R05>
1871.604-2  Determination of ``Finalists''.

    (a) All acceptable offers will be evaluated against the requirement 
and the value characteristics. Based on this evaluation, the team will 
identify the finalists from among the offers submitted. Finalists will 
include all offers having a reasonable chance of being selected for 
award, as prescribed in FAR 15.609 for competitive range. Generally, 
finalists will include the offer having the best price (or lowest most 
probable cost) and the offer having the highest qualitative merit, plus 
those determined to have the best combination of price and merit. Offers 
not qualifying as finalists will be excluded from the balance of the 
evaluation process.
    (b) The selection official may elect to make selection in lieu of 
determining finalists, provided it can be clearly demonstrated that
    (1) Selection of an initial offer(s) will result in the best value 
for the Government, considering both price and non-price qualitative 
criteria;
    (2) Discussions with other acceptable offerors are not anticipated 
to change the outcome of the initial evaluation relative to the best 
value offer(s), and
    (3) The solicitation contains a provision permitting award without 
discussions.
    (c) Documentation. If finalists are identified as discussed in 
paragraph (a) of this section, the documentation expected and required 
to result from this phase of evaluation is approximately one-quarter of 
a page for each finalist. The documentation shall succinctly describe 
how the value characteristics in the RFO were provided by the offeror 
and cost/price considerations that caused the offer to qualify as a 
finalist. The evaluator(s) shall not be required to justify why other 
offers provided less qualitative merit. It is expected that, should the 
decision be challenged, the documented reason for selection, when 
compared with the non-selected offer, shall clearly demonstrate the 
difference that resulted in non-selection. It is expected and 
recommended that all informal worksheets used in the evaluation process 
be included in the contract file. When selection of the successful 
offeror(s) is made, the buying team shall document the selection in 
accordance with 1871.604-4(c).
    (d) The names of offerors determined to be finalists or selected for 
contract

[[Page 423]]

award will be electronically transmitted to all offerors. This will 
serve as notification to those offerors that were not selected for 
further evaluation (see 1871.505).


<R05>
1871.604-3  Discussions with ``Finalists''.

    (a) The procurement team member shall lead discussions with each 
finalist. Care must be exercised to ensure these discussions adhere, to 
the extent applicable, to the guidelines set forth in FAR 15.610. It is 
expected that these discussions will be conducted on an informal basis 
with each finalist.
    (b) After completion of discussions, each finalist shall be afforded 
an opportunity to revise its offer. A reasonable amount of time 
(normally less than 5 working days) will be afforded for the revision. 
The amount of time given shall be the same for each finalist.


<R05>
1871.604-4  Selection of ``Best Value'' Offer.

    (a) The procurement team member shall be the source selection 
official.
    (b) The BVS source selection is based on the premise that, if all 
offers are of approximately equal qualitative merit, award will be made 
to the offer with the lowest evaluated price (fixed-price contracts) or 
the lowest most probable cost (cost type contracts). However, the 
Government will consider awarding to an offeror with higher qualitative 
merit if the difference in price is commensurate with added value. 
Conversely, the Government will consider making award to an offeror 
whose offer has lower qualitative merit if the price (or cost) 
differential between it and other offers warrant doing so.
    (c) Documentation. Rationale for selection of the successful offeror 
shall be recorded in a selection statement which succinctly records the 
value characteristics upon which selection was made. The statement need 
not and should not reveal details of the successful offer that are 
proprietary or business sensitive. Since the value characteristics are 
expressed in performance terms, the reasons for selection can focus on 
results to be achieved, rather than the detailed approach the offeror 
will use. The statement shall also comment on the rationale used to 
equate cost and qualitative merit. Little or no additional analysis is 
required when the selected offeror possessed the highest merit and 
lowest price. When a marginal analysis is made between value 
characteristics and price (or cost)--in most cases this will be a 
subjective, integrated assessment of all pertinent factors--specific 
rationale should be provided to the extent possible. It is expected that 
the statement will not ordinarily exceed one page. Where the procurement 
is closely contested, it would be prudent to expand on the rationale 
provided in the statement.
    (d) The name of the offeror(s) selected for award shall be 
electronically transmitted to the offerors which will serve as a 
notification to those offerors that were not selected (see 1871.505). 
The selection statement may be made available at the buying team's 
discretion.

<R05>
1872.000  Scope of part.

    This part prescribes policies and procedures for the acquisition of 
investigations.


<R04>
          Subpart 1872.1--The Investigation Acquisition System


<R05>
1872.101  General.

    The investigation acquisition system encourages the participation of 
investigators and the selection of investigations which contribute most 
effectively to the advancement of NASA's scientific and technological 
objectives. It is a system separate from the acquisition process, but 
requiring the same management and discipline to assure compliance with 
statutory requirements and considerations of equity.


<R05>
1872.102  Key features of the system.

    (a)(1) Use of the system commences with a Program Associate 
Administrator's determination that the investigation acquisition process 
is appropriate for a program. An Announcement of Opportunity (AO) is 
disseminated to the interested scientific and technical communities. 
This solicitation does not specify the investigations to be proposed but 
solicits investigative ideas which contribute to broad objectives. In 
order to determine which of the proposals should be selected, a formal 
competitive evaluation process is utilized. The evaluation for merit is 
normally made by experts in the fields represented by the proposals. 
Care should be taken to avoid conflicts of interest. These evaluators 
may be from NASA, other Government agencies, universities, or the 
commercial sector. Along with or subsequent to the evaluation for merit, 
the other factors of the proposals, such as engineering, cost, and 
integration aspects, are reviewed by specialists in those areas. The 
evaluation conclusions as well as considerations of budget and other 
factors are used to formulate a complement of recommended 
investigations. A steering committee serving as staff to the Program 
Associate Administrator (Program AA), or designee when source selection 
authority is delegated, reviews the proposed payload or program of 
investigation, the iterative process, and the selection recommendations. 
The steering committee serves as a forum where different interests, such 
as flight program, discipline management, and administration, can be 
weighed.
    (2) The Program AA, or designee, selects the proposals that will 
participate in the program. Once selected, an investigator is assigned 
appropriate responsibilities relating to the investigation through a 
contract with the institution. For foreign investigators, these 
responsibilities will usually be outlined in an agreement between NASA 
and the sponsoring governmental agency in the investigator's country.

[[Page 425]]

    (b) The AO process provides a disciplined approach to investigation 
acquisition. The following major steps must be followed in each case:
    (1) The AO shall be signed by the Program AA and shall be widely 
distributed to the scientific, technological, and applications user 
communities, as appropriate.
    (2) An evaluation team shall be formed including recognized peers of 
the investigators.
    (3) A project office will be assigned to assess the engineering, 
cost, integration, and management aspects of the proposals.
    (4) A program office will be responsible to formulate a complement 
of investigations consistent with the objectives stated in the AO, cost, 
and schedule constraints.
    (5) A steering committee appointed by the appropriate Program AA 
shall review the proposed investigations for relevance and merit, will 
assure compliance with the system as described in this Handbook, and 
make selection recommendations.
    (6) The Source Selection Official shall be the Program AA or the 
Program AA's designee.
    (c) Payloads will be formulated consisting of investigations 
selected through the AO process and/or other authorized methods.


<R05>
1872.103  Management responsibilities.

    (a) Program AAs are responsible for overseeing the process and for 
making key decisions essential to the process including:
    (1) Determination to use the investigation acquisition system.
    (2) Appointment of the steering committee members.
    (3) Designation of a staff to assure uniformity in the issuance of 
the AO and conformity with the required procedures in the evaluation and 
selection.
    (4) Reuse, to the maximum extent practicable, of space hardware and 
support equipment.
    (5) Determination to use advisory subcommittees, contractor, or 
full-time Government employees only in the evaluation process.
    (6) Issuance of the AO.
    (7) Selection of investigations and investigators, determination of 
need of a definition phase, determination of the role of the 
investigator with regard to providing essential investigation hardware 
and services, and determination of the need for payload specialists.
    (8) Assure consideration is given to minorities in the establishment 
of peer groups, distribution of the AO and in the selection of 
investigations.
    (9) Provide a framework for cooperative foreign participation in 
Space Shuttle, Spacelab, and Space Station missions.
    (b) The Program AA should call upon any required experts throughout 
the process.


<R04>
              Subpart 1872.2--Applicability of the Process


<R05>
1872.201  General.

    The system used for acquisition of investigations is separate from 
the agency procedures for acquisition of known requirements. A decision 
to use this special acquisition process will be based on a determination 
that it is the most suitable to meet program needs. The decision-making 
official will consider the criteria for use of the system. The project 
plan or other documentation should discuss the proposed mode of 
investigations selection.


<R05>
1872.202  Criteria for determining applicability.

    (a) The decision to use the investigations acquisition process as an 
alternative to the normal planning and acquisition process can only be 
made after consideration of the conditions which require its use. All of 
the following conditions should exist before deciding that the system is 
applicable:
    (1) NASA has a general objective which can be furthered through 
novel experimental approaches. To develop such approaches, NASA wishes 
to draw upon the broadest possible reservoir of ideas.
    (2) Choices must be made among competing ideas in expanding 
knowledge.
    (3) Individual participation of an investigator is essential to 
exploitation of the opportunity.

[[Page 426]]

    (b) The investigations acquisition process shall not be used when 
any of the following characteristics are present:
    (1) The requiring office can define a requirement sufficiently to 
allow for normal acquisition.
    (2) The program is extremely complex, requiring specialized 
integration, coordination, or other special handling, or extending over 
a lengthy period wherein individual participation is not essential.


<R05>
1872.203  Applicable programs and activities.

    The investigation acquisition process is most suitable for 
investigations aimed at exploration requiring several unique sensors or 
instruments, but it has been used successfully in the following types of 
activities:
    (a) Exploration and space research flights. (1) Examples include 
Space Transportation System (STS) flights with attached payloads, 
generally Spacelab payloads; and free-flying spacecraft, such as 
Explorers, Pioneers, Space Telescope, Landsats, and Long Duration 
Exposure Facilities.
    (2) Types of opportunity include:
    (i) Participation as a Principal Investigator (PI) responsible for 
conceiving and conducting a space investigation (This may involve a 
major piece of instrumentation. In the case of a ``facility'' or 
``multiuser'' payload, each PI's responsibilities would ordinarily 
involve a relatively minor portion of the total instrument.);
    (ii) An opportunity to serve on a PI's team as a member or Co-
Investigator;
    (iii) An opportunity that generally involves the use of data from 
another investigator's instrument as a guest investigator or guest 
observer (Guest investigators usually participate after the primary 
objectives have been satisfied for the investigations involved.); and
    (iv) A team formed from selected investigators to assist in defining 
planned mission objectives and/or to determine, in a general manner, the 
most meaningful instruments to accomplish the mission objectives.
    (3) The investigation acquisition process may be applicable to all 
types of opportunities. The supposition common in these opportunities is 
that the best ideas and approaches are likely to result from the 
broadest possible involvement of the scientific, technological or 
applications user communities.
    (b) Minor missions. (1) Examples include research aircraft, sounding 
rockets, balloons, and minor missions that are generally of short 
duration, small in size, often single purpose, and subject to 
repetition. Many investigations are follow-on to past-flight 
investigations.
    (2) Types of opportunity include:
    (i) PIs responsible for investigation; and
    (ii) Data use or analysis.
    (3) Opportunities for participation on minor missions are generally 
suitable for normal acquisition procedures. The use of an announcement 
describing the general nature and schedule of flights may be appropriate 
when considered necessary to broaden participation by requesting 
investigator-initiated research proposals. Normal acquisition procedures 
shall be used for follow-on repeat flights. Although NASA seeks unique, 
innovative ideas for these missions, the prospect of reflight and the 
latitude in determining number and schedule of flights argue against the 
need for the use of the investigations acquisition process to force 
dissimilar proposals into an annual or periodic competitive structure. 
On the other hand, there are some minor missions addressed to specific 
limited opportunities; for example, a solar eclipse. When such 
limitations indicate that the special competitive structure is needed, 
it should be authorized.
    (c) Operational and operational prototype spacecraft. (1) Examples 
include spacecraft built for NASA and other agencys' missions.
    (2) The user agency can be expected to specify performance 
parameters. Payload definition will be the responsibility of the user 
agency and NASA. Specifications sufficient for normal acquisition 
procedures can be produced. Use of data from the mission is the 
responsibility of the user agency. Thus, the investigation acquisition 
process is not required.
    (d) Supporting Research and Technology (SR&T). (1) Examples include

[[Page 427]]

studies, minor developments, instrument conceptualization, ground-based 
observations, laboratory and theoretical supporting research, and data 
reduction and analysis which is unconstrained by a specific opportunity.
    (2) Programs in these areas tend to go forward on a continuing 
basis, rather than exploiting unique opportunities. Normal acquisition 
procedures should be used. A general announcement of area of interest 
could be made when greater participation is deemed advisable.


<R05>
1872.204  Approval.

    The Program AA is responsible for determining whether or not to use 
the investigations acquisition process. Normally on major projects, or 
when a project plan is required, use of the investigation acquisition 
system will be justified and recommended in the project planning 
documentation and will be coordinated with staff offices and discussed 
in the planning presentation to the Deputy Administrator or designee.


<R04>
             Subpart 1872.3--The Announcement of Opportunity


<R05>
1872.301  General.

    An announcement of opportunity (AO) is characterized by its 
generality. However, it is essential that the AO contains sufficient 
data in order to obtain meaningful proposals. To a considerable extent, 
the detail and depth of the AO will depend on the objective. The purpose 
is to get adequate information to assess the relevance, merit, cost, and 
management requirements without overburdening the proposer.


<R05>
1872.302  Preparatory effort.

    (a) Headquarters offices and the responsible project installation 
must consult prior to release of the AO.
    (b) The program office shall:
    (1) Synopsize the AO in the Commerce Business Daily prior to the 
time of release;
    (2) Determine if there is instrumentation or support equipment 
available which may be appropriate to the AO with all necessary 
background data considered essential for use by a proposer;
    (3) Determine mailing lists, including the mailing list maintained 
by the International Affairs Division, Office of External Relations, for 
broad dissemination of the AO; and
    (4) Assure mandatory provisions are contained in the AO.
    (c) Other methods of dissemination of the AO may also be used, such 
as the use of press releases, etc. When possible, the AO should be 
widely publicized through publications of appropriate professional 
societies; however, NASA policy does not allow payment for the placement 
of advertisements.


<R05>
1872.303  Responsibilities.

    (a) The program office originator is responsible for the content of 
the AO and coordination with concerned Headquarters offices and field 
installations. All personnel involved in the evaluation of proposals are 
responsible for familiarizing themselves and complying with this part 
and other applicable regulations. To this end, they are expected to seek 
the advice and guidance of appropriate Headquarters program and staff 
offices, and Project Installation management.
    (b) The Program Office is also responsible for coordinating the AO 
with the International Affairs, Educational Affairs, Management Support 
Divisions, Office of External Relations, Office of General Counsel, and 
Office of Acquisition prior to issuance (see NMI 1362.1, Initiation and 
Development of International Cooperation in Space and Aeronautical 
Programs).
    (c) Concurrence of the Office of Acquisition is required before 
issuance of an AO.


<R05>
1872.304  Proposal opportunity period.

    (a) The AO must accommodate to the maximum extent practicable 
opportunities afforded by the Shuttle/Spacelab flights. The following 
methods may be used to enable an AO to be open for an extended period of 
time and/or to cover a series or range of flight possibilities or 
disciplines:
    (1) The AO may be issued establishing a number of proposal 
submission dates. Normally, no more than three proposal submission dates 
should be established. The submittal dates may be spread over the number 
of months

[[Page 428]]

most compatible with the possible flight opportunities and the 
availability of resources necessary to evaluate and fund the proposals.
    (2) The AO may be issued establishing a single proposal submission 
date. However, the AO could provide that NASA amend the AO to provide 
for subsequent dates for submission of proposals, if additional 
investigations are desired within the AO objectives.
    (3) The AO may provide for an initial submission date with the AO to 
remain open for submission of additional proposals up to a final cutoff 
date. This final date should be related to the availability of resources 
necessary to evaluate the continuous flow of proposals, the time 
remaining prior to the flight opportunity(s) contemplated by the AO, and 
payload funding and availability.
    (b) Generally, a core payload of investigations would be selected 
from the initial submission of proposals under the above methods of 
open-ended AOs. These selections could be final or tentative recognizing 
the need for further definition. Proposals received by subsequent 
submission dates would be considered in the scope of the original AO but 
would be subject to the opportunities and resources remaining available 
or the progress being made by prior selected investigations.
    (c) Any proposal, whether received on the initial submission or 
subsequent submission, requires notification to the investigator and the 
investigator's institution of the proposal disposition. Some of the 
proposals will be rejected completely and the investigators immediately 
notified. The remaining unselected proposals may, if agreeable with the 
proposers, be held for later consideration and funding and the 
investigator so notified. However, if an investigator's proposal is 
considered at a later date, the investigator must be given an 
opportunity to validate the proposal with the investigator's institution 
and for updating the cost and other data contained in the original 
submission prior to a final selection. In summary, NASA may retain 
proposals, receiving Category I, II, or III classifications (see 
1872.403-1(e)), for possible later sponsorship until no longer feasible 
to consider the proposal. When this final stage is reached, the 
investigator must be promptly notified. Proposing investigators not 
desiring their proposals be held for later consideration should be given 
the opportunity to so indicate in their original submissions.


<R05>
1872.305  Guidelines for Announcement of Opportunity.

    (a) The AO should be tailored to the particular needs of the 
contemplated investigations and be complete in itself. Each AO will 
identify the originating program office and be numbered consecutively by 
calendar year, e.g., OA-1-95, OA-2-95; OLMSA-1-95; OSS-1-95; etc. The 
required format and detailed instructions regarding the contents of the 
AO are contained in 1872.705.
    (b) The General Instructions and Provisions, Appendix A (see 
1872.705-1) are necessary to accommodate the unique aspects of the AO 
process. Therefore, they must be appended to each AO.
    (c) At the time of issuance, copies of the AO must be furnished to 
Headquarters, Office of Acquisition (Code HS) and Office of General 
Counsel (Code GK).
    (d) Proposers should be informed of significant departures from 
scheduled dates for activities related in the AO.


<R05>
1872.306  Announcement of Opportunity soliciting foreign participation.

    Proposals for participation by individuals outside the U.S. shall be 
submitted in the same format (excluding cost plans) as U.S. proposals, 
typewritten in English, and reviewed and endorsed by the appropriate 
foreign governmental agency. If letters of ``Notice of Intent'' are 
required, the AO should indicate that they be sent to Headquarters, 
Office of External Relations, International Relations Division (Code 
IR). Should a foreign proposal be selected, NASA will arrange with the 
sponsoring foreign agency for the proposed participation on a no-
exchange-of-funds basis, in which NASA and the sponsoring agency will 
each bear the cost of discharging its respective responsibilities. Note 
that additional guidelines applicable to foreign proposers are contained 
in the Management

[[Page 429]]

Plan Section of Appendix B (see 1872.705-and must be included in any 
Guidelines for Proposal Preparation or otherwise furnished to foreign 
proposers.


<R05>
1872.307  Guidelines for proposal preparation.

    While not all of the guidelines outlined in Appendix B will be 
applicable in response to every AO, the investigator should be informed 
of the relevant information required. The proposal may be submitted on a 
form supplied by the Program Office. However, the proposal should be 
submitted in at least two sections:
    (a) Investigation and Technical Section; and (b) Management and Cost 
Section as described in Appendix B.


<R04>
                 Subpart 1872.4--Evaluation of Proposals


<R05>
1872.401  General.

    (a) The evaluation process considers the aspects of each proposal by 
the following progressive sorting:
    (1) A review resulting in a categorization is performed by using one 
of the methods or combination of the methods outlined in 1872.403. The 
purpose of this initial review is to determine the scientific and/or 
technological merit of the proposals in the context of the AO 
objectives.
    (2) Those proposals which are considered to have the greatest 
scientific or technological merit are then reviewed in detail for the 
engineering, management, and cost aspects, usually by the project office 
at the installation responsible for the project.
    (3) Final reviews are performed by the program office and the 
steering committee and are aimed at developing a group of investigations 
which represent an integrated payload or a well-balanced program of 
investigation which has the best possibility for meeting the AO's 
objectives within programmatic constraints.
    (b) The importance of considering the interrelationship of the 
several aspects of the proposals to be reviewed in the process and the 
need for carefully planning their treatment should not be overlooked. An 
evaluation plan should be developed before issuance of the AO. It should 
cover the recommended staffing for any subcommittee or contractor 
support, review guidelines as well as the procedural flow and schedule 
of the evaluation. While not mandatory, such a plan should be considered 
for each AO. A fuller discussion of the evaluation and selection process 
is included in the following sections of this subpart.


<R05>
1872.402  Criteria for evaluation.

    (a) Each AO must indicate those criteria which the evaluators will 
apply in evaluating a proposal. The relative importance of each 
criterion must also be stated. This information will allow investigators 
to make informed judgments in formulating proposals that best meet the 
stated objectives.
    (b) Following is a list of general evaluation criteria appropriate 
for inclusion in most AOs:
    (1) The scientific, applications, and/or technological merit of the 
investigation.
    (2) The relevance of the proposed investigation to the AO's stated 
scientific, applications, and/or technological objectives.
    (3) The competence and experience of the investigator and any 
investigative team.
    (4) Adequacy of whatever apparatus may be proposed with particular 
regard to its ability to supply the data needed for the investigation.
    (5) The reputation and interest of the investigator's institution, 
as measured by the willingness of the institution to provide the support 
necessary to ensure that the investigation can be completed 
satisfactorily.
    (6) Cost and management aspects will be considered in all 
selections.
    (7) Other or additional criteria may be used, but the evaluation 
criteria must be germane to the accomplishment of the stated objectives.
    (c) Once the AO is issued, it is essential that the evaluation 
criteria be applied in a uniform manner. If it becomes apparent, before 
the date set for receipt of proposals, that the criteria or their 
relative importance should be changed, the AO will be amended, and all 
known recipients will be informed of the change and given an adequate

[[Page 430]]

opportunity to consider it in submission of their proposals. Evaluation 
criteria and/or their relative importance will not be changed after the 
date set for receipt of proposals.


<R05>
1872.403  Methods of evaluation.

    Alternative methods are available to initiate the evaluation of 
proposals received in response to an AO. These are referred to as the 
Advisory Subcommittee Evaluation Process, the Contractor Evaluation 
Process, and the Government Evaluation Process. In all processes, a 
subcommittee of the appropriate Program Office Steering Committee will 
be formed to categorize the proposals. Following categorization, those 
proposals still in consideration will be processed to the selection 
official.


<R05>
1872.403-1  Advisory subcommittee evaluation process.

    (a) Evaluation of scientific and/or technological merit of proposed 
investigations is the responsibility of an advisory subcommittee of the 
Steering Committee. The subcommittee constitutes a peer group qualified 
to judge the scientific and technological aspects of all investigation 
proposals. One or more subcommittees may be established depending on the 
breadth of the technical or scientific disciplines inherent in the AO's 
objectives. Each subcommittee represents a discipline or grouping of 
closely related disciplines. To maximize the quality of the subcommittee 
evaluation and categorization, the following conditions of selection and 
appointment should be considered.
    (1) The subcommittee normally should be established on an ad hoc 
basis.
    (2) Qualifications and acknowledgment of the professional abilities 
of the subcommittee members are of primary importance. Institutional 
affiliations are not sufficient qualifications.
    (3) The executive secretary of the subcommittee must be a full-time 
NASA employee.
    (4) Subcommittee members should normally be appointed as early as 
possible and prior to receipt of proposals.
    (5) Care must be taken to avoid conflicts of interest. These include 
financial interests, institutional affiliations, professional biases and 
associations, as well as familiar relationships. Conflicts could further 
occur as a result of imbalance between Government and non-Government 
appointees or membership from institutions representing a singular 
school of thought in discipline areas involving competitive theories in 
approach to an investigation.
    (6) The subcommittee should convene as a group in closed sessions 
for proposal evaluation to protect the proposer's proprietary ideas and 
to allow frank discussion of the proposer's qualifications and the merit 
of the proposer's ideas. Lead review responsibility for each proposal 
may be assigned to members most qualified in the involved discipline. It 
is important that each proposal be considered by the entire 
subcommittee.
    (b) It may not be possible to select a subcommittee fully satisfying 
all of the conditions described in paragraph (a) of this section. It is 
the responsibility of the nominating and appointing officials to make 
trade-offs, where necessary, among the criteria in paragraph (a) of this 
section. This latitude permits flexibility in making decisions in accord 
with circumstances of each application. In so doing, however, it is 
emphasized that recognized expertise in evaluating dissimilar proposals 
is essential to the continued workability of the investigation 
acquisition process.
    (c) Candidate subcommittee members should be nominated by the office 
having responsibility for the evaluation. Nominations should be approved 
in accordance with NMI 1150.2, ``Establishment, Operation, and Duration 
of NASA Advisory Committees.'' The notification of appointment should 
specify the duration of assignment on the subcommittee, provisions 
concerning conflicts of interest, and arrangements regarding honoraria, 
per diem, and travel when actually employed.
    (d) It is important that members of the subcommittee be formally 
instructed as to their responsibilities with respect to the 
investigation acquisition process, even where several or

[[Page 431]]

all of the members have served previously. This briefing of subcommittee 
members should include:
    (1) Instruction of subcommittee members on agency policies and 
procedures pertinent to acquisition of investigations.
    (2) Review of the program goals, AO objectives, and evaluation 
criteria, including relative importance, which provide the basis for 
evaluation.
    (3) Instruction on the use of preliminary proposal evaluation data 
furnished by the Installation Project Office. The subcommittee should 
examine these data to gain a better understanding of the proposed 
investigations, any associated problems, and to consider cost in 
relation to the value of the investigations' objectives.
    (4) Definition of responsibility of the subcommittee for evaluation 
and categorization with respect to scientific and/or technical merit in 
accordance with the evaluation criteria.
    (5) Instruction for documentation of deliberations and 
categorizations of the subcommittee.
    (6) Inform the chairperson of the subcommittee and all members that 
they should familiarize themselves with the provisions of the Standards 
of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, 5 CFR part 
2635, and the Supplemental Standards of Ethical Conduct for employees of 
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 5 CFR part 6901, 
regarding conflicts of interest. Members should inform the appointing 
authority if their participation presents a real or apparent conflict of 
interest situation. In addition, all participants should inform the 
selection official in the event they are subjected to pressure or 
improper contacts.
    (7) Inform members that prior to the selection and announcement of 
the successful investigators and investigations, subcommittee members 
and NASA personnel shall not reveal any information concerning the 
evaluation to anyone who is not also participating in the same 
evaluation proceedings, and then only to the extent that such 
information is required in connection with such proceedings. Also, 
inform members that subsequent to selection of an investigation and 
announcement of negotiations with the investigator's institution, 
information concerning the proceedings of the subcommittee and data 
developed by the subcommittee will be made available to others within 
NASA only when the requestor demonstrates a need to know for a NASA 
purpose. Such information will be made available to persons outside NASA 
including other Government agencies, only when such disclosure is 
concurred in by the Office of General Counsel. In this connection, 
reference is made to 18 U.S.C. 1905 which provides criminal sanctions if 
any officer or employee (including special employees) of the United 
States discloses or divulges certain kinds of business confidential and 
trade secret information unless authorized by law.
    (e) The product of an advisory subcommittee is the classification of 
proposals into four categories. The categories are:
    (1) Category I--Well conceived and scientifically and technically 
sound investigations pertinent to the goals of the program and the AO's 
objectives and offered by a competent investigator from an institution 
capable of supplying the necessary support to ensure that any essential 
flight hardware or other support can be delivered on time and that data 
can be properly reduced, analyzed, interpreted, and published in a 
reasonable time. Investigations in Category I are recommended for 
acceptance and normally will be displaced only by other Category I 
investigations.
    (2) Category II--Well conceived and scientifically or technically 
sound investigations which are recommended for acceptance, but at a 
lower priority than Category I.
    (3) Category III--Scientifically and technically sound 
investigations which require further development. Category III 
investigations may be funded for development and may be reconsidered at 
a later time for the same or other opportunities.
    (4) Category IV--Proposed investigations which are recommended for 
rejection for the particular opportunity under consideration, whatever 
the reason.
    (f) A record of the deliberations of the subcommittee shall be 
prepared by

[[Page 432]]

the assigned executive secretary and shall be signed by the Chairperson. 
The minutes shall contain the categorizations with basic rationale for 
such ratings and the significant strengths and weaknesses of the 
proposals evaluated.


<R05>
1872.403-2  Contractor evaluation process.

    (a) The use of the contractor method for obtaining support for 
evaluation purposes of proposals received in response to an AO requires 
the approval of the Program AA. Prior to the use of this method, 
discussion should be held with the Office of Acquisition.
    (b) It is NASA policy to avoid situations in the acquisition process 
where, by virtue of the work or services performed for NASA, or as a 
result of data acquired from NASA or from other entities, a particular 
company:
    (1) Is given an unfair competitive advantage over other companies 
with respect to future NASA business;
    (2) Is placed in position to affect Government actions under 
circumstances in which there is potential that the company's judgment 
may be biased; or
    (3) Otherwise finds that a conflict exists between the performance 
of work or services for the Government in an impartial manner and the 
company's own self-interest.
    (c) To reduce the possibility of an organizational conflict of 
interest problem arising, the following minimum restrictions will be 
incorporated into the contract:
    (1) No employee of the contractor will be permitted to propose in 
response to the AO;
    (2) The ``Limitation on Future Contracting'' clause contained in 
1852.209-71 and the conditions set forth in 1815.413-2 Alternate II will 
be included in all such contracts; and
    (3) Unless authorized by the NASA contracting officer, the 
contractor shall not contact the originator of any proposal concerning 
its contents.
    (d) The scope of work for the selected contractor will provide for 
an identification of strengths and weaknesses and a summary of the 
proposals. The contractor will not make selections nor recommend 
investigations.
    (e) The steps to be taken in establishing evaluation panels and the 
responsibilities of NASA and the contractor in relation to the panels 
will be as follows:
    (1) The contractor will be required to establish and provide support 
to panels of experts for review of proposals to evaluate their 
scientific and technical merit;
    (2) These panels will be composed of scientists and specialists 
qualified to evaluate the proposals;
    (3) The agency may provide to the contractor lists of scientist(s) 
and specialist(s) in the various disciplines it believes are qualified 
to serve on the panels;
    (4) The contractor will report each panel's membership to NASA for 
approval; and
    (5) The contractor must make all the necessary arrangements with the 
panel members.
    (f) The evaluation support by the contractor's panels of experts 
will be accomplished as follows:
    (1) The panels will review the scientific and technical merit of the 
proposals in accordance with the evaluation criteria in the AO and will 
record their strengths and weaknesses;
    (2) The contractor will make records of each panel's deliberations 
which will form the basis for a report summarizing the results of the 
evaluations. Upon request, the contractor shall provide all such records 
to NASA;
    (3) The chairperson of each panel shall certify that the evaluation 
report correctly represents the findings of the review panel; and
    (4) A final report will be submitted as provided in the contract.
    (g) A subcommittee of the Program Office Steering Committee will be 
established on an ad hoc basis. Utilizing furnished data, the 
subcommittee will classify the proposals into the four categories 
enumerated in 1872.403-1(e)(1), Advisory Subcommittee Evaluation 
Process. A record of the deliberations of the subcommittee should be 
prepared by an assigned executive secretary and signed by the 
chairperson. The minutes should contain the categorizations with the 
basic rationale for such ratings and the significant strengths and 
weaknesses of the proposals evaluated.

[[Page 433]]


<R05>
1872.403-3  Government evaluation process.

    (a) The Program AA may, in accordance with NMI 1150.2, appoint one 
or more full-time Government employees as subcommittee members of the 
Program Office Steering Committee to evaluate and categorize the 
proposals.
    (b) Each subcommittee member should be qualified and competent to 
evaluate the proposals in accordance with the AO evaluation criteria. It 
is important that a subcommittee's evaluation not be influenced by 
others either within or outside of NASA.
    (c) The subcommittee members will not contact the proposers for 
additional information.
    (d) The subcommittee members will classify the proposals in 
accordance with the four categories indicated in 1872.403-1(e)(1). Each 
categorization will be supported by an appropriate rationale including a 
narrative of each proposal's strengths and weaknesses.


<R05>
1872.404  Engineering, integration, and management evaluation.

    (a) The subcommittee responsible for categorization of each proposal 
in terms of its scientific applications, or technical merit should 
receive information on probable cost, technical status, developmental 
risk, integration and safety problems, and management arrangements in 
time for their deliberations.
    (b) This information should be provided at the discretion of the 
Headquarters Program Office by the Project Office at the installation. 
This information can be in general terms and should reflect what 
insights the Project Office can provide without requesting additional 
details from the proposers. This limited Project Office review will not 
normally give the subcommittees information of significant precision. 
The purpose is to give the subcommittee sufficient information so it can 
review the proposals in conjunction with available cost, integration, 
and management considerations to gain an impression of each 
investigator's understanding of the problems of the experiment and to 
permit gross trade-offs of cost versus value of the investigation 
objective.
    (c) Following categorization, the Project Office shall evaluate 
proposals in contention, in depth, including a thorough review of each 
proposal's engineering, integration, management, and cost aspects. This 
review should be accomplished by qualified engineering, cost, and 
business analysts at the project center.
    (d) In assessing proposed costs, the evaluation must consider:
    (1) The investigation objective.
    (2) Comparable, similar or related investigations.
    (3) Whether NASA or the investigator should procure the necessary 
supporting instrumentation or services and the relative cost of each 
mode.
    (4) Total overall or probable costs to the Government including 
integration and data reduction and analysis. In the case of 
investigations proposed by Government investigators, this includes all 
associated direct and indirect cost. With respect to cooperative 
investigations, integration, and other applicable costs should be 
considered.
    (e) The Project Office, as part of the in-depth evaluation of 
proposals that require instrumentation or support equipment, will survey 
all potential sources for Government-owned instrumentation or support 
equipment that may be made available, with or without modifications, to 
the potential investigator. Such items contributed by foreign 
cooperating groups which are still available under cooperative project 
agreements will also be considered for use under the terms and 
conditions specified in the agreements. As part of the evaluation report 
to the Program Office, the availability or nonavailability of 
instrumentation or support equipment will be indicated.
    (f) Proposals which require instrumentation should be evaluated by 
project personnel. This evaluation should cover the inter-faces and the 
assessment of development risks. This evaluation should furnish the 
selection official with sufficient data to contribute to the instrument 
determinations. Important among these are:
    (1) Whether the instrument requires further definition;
    (2) Whether studies and designs are necessary to provide a 
reasonably accurate appreciation of the cost;

[[Page 434]]

    (3) Whether the investigation can be carried out without incurring 
undue cost, schedule, or risk of failure penalties; and
    (4) Whether integration of the instrument is feasible.
    (g) In reviewing an investigator's management plan, the Project 
Office should evaluate the investigator's approach for efficiently 
managing the work, the recognition of essential management functions, 
and the effective overall integration of these functions. Evaluation of 
the proposals under final consideration should include, but not be 
limited to: workload--present and future related to capacity and 
capability; past experience; management approach and organization; e.g.:
    (1) With respect to workload and its relationship to capacity and 
capability, it is important to ascertain the extent to which the 
investigator is capable of providing facilities and personnel skills 
necessary to perform the required effort on a timely basis. This review 
should reveal the need for additional facilities or people, and provide 
some indication of the Government support the investigator will require.
    (2) A review should be made of the investigator, the investigator's 
institution, and any supporting contractor's performance on prior 
investigations. This should assist in arriving at an assessment of the 
investigator and the institution's ability to perform the effort within 
the proposed cost and time constraints.
    (3) The proposed investigator's management arrangements should be 
reviewed, including make or buy choices, support of any co-investigator, 
and preselected subcontractors or other instrument fabricators to 
determine whether such arrangements are justified. The review should 
determine if the proposed management arrangements enhance the 
investigator's ability to devote more time to the proposed experiment 
objectives and still effectively employ the technical and administrative 
support required for a successful investigation. In making these 
evaluations, the Project Office should draw on the installation's 
engineering, business, legal, and other staff resources, as necessary, 
as well as its scientific resources. If further information is needed 
from the proposers, it should be obtained through the proper contacts.


<R05>
1872.405  Program office evaluation.

    (a) A Program Office responsible for the project or program at 
Headquarters will receive the evaluation of the proposals, and weigh the 
evaluative data to determine an optimum payload or program of 
investigation. This determination will involve recommendations 
concerning individual investigations; but, more importantly, should 
result in a payload or program which is judged to optimize total mission 
return within schedule, engineering, and budgetary constraints. The 
recommendations should facilitate sound selection decisions by the 
Program AA. Three sets of recommendations result from the Program Office 
evaluation:
    (1) Optimum payload or program of investigations, or options for 
alternative payloads or programs.
    (2) Recommendation for final or tentative selection based on a 
determination of the degree of uncertainty associated with individual 
investigations. A tentative selection may be considered step one of a 
two-step selection technique.
    (3) Upon consideration of the guidelines contained in 
1872.502(a)(3), recommending responsibility for instrument development.
    (b) The Installation Project Office evaluation is principally 
concerned with ensuring that the proposed investigation can be managed, 
developed, integrated, and executed with an appropriate probability of 
technical success within the estimated probable cost. The Headquarters 
Program Director, drawing upon these inputs, should be mainly concerned 
with determining a payload or program from the point of view of 
programmatic goals and budgetary constraints. Discipline and cost trade-
offs are considered at this level. The Headquarters Program Office 
should focus on the potential contribution to program objectives that 
can be achieved under alternative feasible payload integration options.
    (c) It may be to NASA's advantage to consider certain investigations 
for tentative selection pending resolution of uncertainties in their 
development.

[[Page 435]]

Tentative selections should be reconsidered after a period of time for 
final selection in a payload or program of investigations. This two-step 
selection process should be considered when:
    (1) The potential return from the investigation is sufficient, 
relative to that of the other investigations under consideration, and 
that its further development appears to be warranted before final 
selection.
    (2) The investigation potential is of such high priority to the 
program that the investigation should be developed for flight if at all 
possible.
    (3) The investigative area is critical to the program and 
competitive approaches need to be developed further to allow selection 
of the optimum course.
    (d) Based on evaluation of these considerations associated with the 
investigations requiring further development of hardware, the following 
information should be provided to the Steering Committee and the Program 
AA responsible for selection:
    (1) The expected gain in potential return associated with the 
eventual incorporation of tentatively recommended investigations in the 
payload(s) or program.
    (2) The expected costs required to develop instrumentation to the 
point of ``demonstrated capability.''
    (3) The risk involved in added cost, probability of successfully 
developing the required instrument capability, and the possibility of 
schedule impact.
    (4) Identification of opportunities, if any, for inclusion of such 
investigations in later missions.
    (e) In those cases where investigations are tentatively selected, an 
explicit statement should be made of the process to be followed in 
determining the final payload or program of investigations and the 
proposers so informed. The two-phase selection approach provides the 
opportunity for additional assurance of development potential and 
probable cost prior to a final commitment to the investigation.
    (f) As instruments used in investigations become increasingly 
complex and costly, the need for greater control of their development by 
the responsible Headquarters Program Office also grows. Accordingly, as 
an integral part of the evaluation process, a deliberate decision should 
be made regarding the role of the Principal Investigator with respect to 
the provision of the major hardware associated with that person's 
investigation. The guidelines for the hardware acquisition determination 
are discussed in 1872.502(a)(3).
    (g) The range of options for responsibility for the instrumentation 
consists of:
    (1) Assignment of full responsibility to the Principal Investigator. 
The responsibility includes all in-house or contracted activity to 
provide the instrumentation for integration.
    (2) Retention of developmental responsibility by the Government with 
participation by the Principal Investigator in key events defined for 
the program. In all cases the right of the Principal Investigator to 
counsel and recommend is paramount. Such involvement of the Principal 
Investigator may include:
    (i) Provision of instrument specifications.
    (ii) Approval of specifications.
    (iii) Independent monitorship of the development and advice to the 
Government on optimization of the instrumentation for the investigation.
    (iv) Participation in design reviews and other appropriate reviews.
    (v) Review and concurrence in changes resulting from design reviews.
    (vi) Participation in configuration control board actions.
    (vii) Advice in definition of test program.
    (viii) Review and approval of test program and changes thereto.
    (ix) Participation in conduct of the test program.
    (x) Participation in calibration of instrument.
    (xi) Participation in final inspection and acceptance of the 
instrument.
    (xii) Participation in subsequent test and evaluation processes 
incident to integration and flight preparation.
    (xiii) Participation in the development and support of the 
operations plan.
    (xiv) Analysis and interpretation of data.
    (h) The Principal Investigator should as a minimum:

[[Page 436]]

    (1) Approve the instrument specification.
    (2) Advise the project manager in development and fabrication.
    (3) Participate in final calibration.
    (4) Develop and support the operations plan.
    (5) Analyze and interpret the data.
    (i) The Project Installation is responsible for implementing the 
program or project and should make recommendations concerning the role 
for the Principal Investigators. The Program AA will determine the role, 
acting upon the advice of the Headquarters Program Office and the 
Steering Committee. The Principal Investigator's desires will be 
respected in the negotiation of the person's role allowing an appeal to 
the Program AA and the right to withdraw from participation.
    (j) The Program Office should make a presentation to the Steering 
Committee with supporting documentation on the decisions to be made by 
the responsible Program AA.


<R05>
1872.406  Steering committee review.

    (a) The most important role of the Steering Committee is to provide 
a substantive review of a potential payload or program of investigations 
and to recommend a selection to the Program AA. The Steering Committee 
applies the collective experience of representatives from the program 
and discipline communities and offers a forum for discussing the 
selection from those points of view. In addition to this mission-
specific evaluation function, the Steering Committee provides guidance 
to subcommittee chairpersons and serves as a clearinghouse for problems 
and complaints regarding the process. The Steering Committee is 
responsible for assuring adherence to required procedures. Lastly, it is 
the forum where discipline objectives are weighed against program 
objectives and constraints.
    (b) The Steering Committee represents the means for exercising three 
responsibilities in the process of selecting investigations to:
    (1) Review compliance with procedures governing application of the 
AO process.
    (2) Ensure that adequate documentation has been made of the steps in 
the evaluation process.
    (3) Review the results of the evaluation by the subcommittee, 
Project, and Program Offices and prepare an assessment or endorsement of 
a recommended payload or program of investigations to the Program AA.
    (c) The Purpose in exercising the first of the responsibilities in 
paragraph (b) of this section is to ensure equity and consistency in the 
application of the process. The Steering Committee is intended to 
provide the necessary reviews and coordination inherent in conventional 
acquisition practices.
    (d) The second and third responsibilities of the Steering Committee 
in paragraph (b) are technical. They require that the Steering Committee 
review the evaluations by subcommittee, the Project Office, and the 
Program Office for completeness and appropriateness before forwarding to 
the Program AA. Most important in this review are:
    (1) Degree to which results of evaluations and recommendations 
follow logically from the criteria in the AO.
    (2) Consistency with objectives and policies generally beyond the 
scope of Project/Program Offices.
    (3) Sufficiency of reasons stated for tentative recommendations of 
those investigations requiring further instrument research and 
development.
    (4) Sufficiency of reasons stated for determining responsibilities 
for instrument development.
    (5) Sufficiency of consideration of reusable space flight hardware 
and support equipment for the recommended investigations.
    (6) Sufficiency of reasons for classifying proposed investigations 
in their respective categories.
    (7) Fair treatment of all proposals.
    (e) The Steering Committee makes recommendations to the selection 
official on the payload or program of investigations and notes caveats 
or provisions important for consideration of the selection official.


<R05>
1872.407  Principles to apply.

    (a) 1872.406 contains a description of the evaluation function 
appropriate for a major payload or very significant program of 
investigation. The levels of

[[Page 437]]

review, evaluation, and refinement described should be applied in those 
selections where warranted but could be varied for less significant 
selection situations. It is essential to consider the principles of the 
several evaluative steps, but it may not be essential to consider the 
principles of the several evaluative steps, but it may not be essential 
to maintain strict adherence to the sequence and structure of the 
evaluation system described. The selection official is responsible for 
determining the evaluation process most appropriate for the selection 
situation using this subpart 1872.4 as a guide.
    (b) Significant deviations from the provisions of this part 1872 
must be fully documented and be approved by the Program AA after 
concurrence by the Office of General Counsel and Office of Acquisition.


<R04>
                  Subpart 1872.5--The Selection Process


<R05>
1872.501  General.

    The Program AA is responsible for selecting investigations for 
contract negotiation. This decision culminates the evaluations and

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
1872.502  Decisions to be made.

    (a) The selection decisions by the Program AA constitute management 
judgments balancing individual and aggregate scientific or technological 
merit, the contribution of the recommended investigations to the AO's 
objectives, and their consonance with budget constraints to make the 
following decisions:
    (1) Determination of the adequacy of scientific/technical analysis 
supporting the recommended selections. This supporting rationale should 
involve considerations including:
    (i) Assurance that the expected return contributes substantially to 
program objectives and is likely to be realized.
    (ii) Assurance that the evaluation criteria were applied 
consistently to all proposed investigations.
    (iii) Assurance that the set of recommended investigations 
constitutes the optimum program or payload considering potential value 
and constraints.
    (iv) Assurance that only one investigator is assigned as the 
Principal Investigator to each investigation and that the Principal 
Investigator will assume the associated responsibilities and be the 
single point of contact and leader of any other investigators selected 
for the same investigation.
    (2) Determination as to whether available returned space hardware or 
support equipment, with or without modification, would be adequate to 
meet or support investigation objectives.
    (3) Determination as to whether the proposed instrument fabricator 
qualifies and should be accepted as a sole source or whether the 
requirement should be competitively procured. The following guidelines 
apply:
    (i) The hardware required should be subjected to competitive 
solicitation where it is clear that the capability is not sufficiently 
unique to justify sole source acquisition.
    (ii) The hardware requirement should be purchased from the 
fabricator proposed by the investigator, which may be the investigator's 
own institution,
    (A) When the fabricator's proposal contains technical data that are 
not

[[Page 438]]

available from another source, and it is not feasible or practicable to 
define the fabrication requirement in such a way as to avoid the 
necessity of using the technical data contained in the proposal;
    (B) When the fabricator offers unique capabilities that are not 
available from another source;
    (C) When the selection official determines that the proposed 
hardware contributes so significantly to the value of the investigator's 
proposal as to be an integral part of it.
    (iii) If a producer other than the one proposed by the investigator 
offers unique capabilities to produce the hardware requirement, NASA may 
buy the hardware from the qualified fabricator.
    (iv) If a NASA employee submits a proposal as a principal 
investigator, any requirement for hardware necessary to perform the 
investigation must either be competed by the installation acquisition 
office or a justification must be written, synopsized, and approved in 
accordance with the requirements of FAR and the NASA FAR Supplement.
    (4) Determination of the desirability for tentative selection of 
investigations. This determination involves considerations including:
    (i) Assessment of the state of development of the investigative 
hardware, the cost and schedule for development in relation to the gain 
in potential benefits at the time of final selection.
    (ii) Assurance that there is adequate definition of investigation 
hardware to allow parallel design of other project hardware.
    (iii) Assurance that appropriate management procedures are contained 
in the project plan for reevaluation and final selection (or rejection) 
on an appropriate time scale.
    (5) Determination of the acceptability of the proposer's management 
plan, including the proposed hardware development plan, and the 
necessity, if any, of negotiating modifications to that plan.
    (b) In the process of making the determinations described in 
paragraph (a) (1) of this section, the Program AA may request additional 
information or evaluations. In most instances, this information can be 
provided by the Program Office responsible for the mission, project, or 
program. However, the Program AA may reconvene the subcommittee or poll 
the members individually or provide for additional analysis or require 
additional data from evaluators or proposers as considered necessary to 
facilitate the Program AA's decision.


<R05>
1872.503  The selection statement.

    Upon completion of deliberations, the responsible Program AA shall 
issue a selection statement. Ordinarily this statement will, upon 
request, be releasable to the public. As a minimum, the selection 
statement should include:
    (a) The general and specific evaluation criteria and relative 
importance used for the selection.
    (b) The categorizations provided by the subcommittee and the 
rationale for accepting or not accepting each Category I proposal and a 
succinct statement concerning the nonacceptance of all other proposals.
    (c) A concise description of each investigation accepted including 
an indication as to whether the selection is a partial acceptance of a 
proposal and/or a combination with other investigators.
    (d) The role of the Principal Investigator with regard to hardware 
essential to the investigation and whether the Principal Investigator 
will be responsible for hardware acquisition and the basis therefor.
    (e) An indication of the plan and acquisition using the regular 
acquisition processes, if the Principal Investigator is not to acquire 
the hardware.
    (f) A statement indicating whether the selection is final or 
tentative, recognizing the need for better definition of the 
investigation and its cost.
    (g) A statement indicating use of Government-owned space flight 
hardware and/or support equipment.


<R05>
1872.504  Notification of proposers.

    (a) It is essential that investigators whose proposals have no 
reasonable chance for selection be so apprised as soon as practicable. 
The responsible Program Office will, upon such determination, notify 
investigators of that fact with the major reason(s) why the

[[Page 439]]

proposals were so considered. The notification letter should also inform 
such investigators that they may obtain a detailed oral debriefing 
provided they request it in writing.
    (b) Letters of notification will be sent to those Principal 
Investigators selected to participate. This letter should not commit the 
agency to more than negotiations for the selected investigation, but it 
should indicate the decision made and contain:
    (1) A concise description of the Principal Investigator's 
investigation as selected, noting substantive changes, if any, from the 
investigation originally proposed by the Principal Investigator.
    (2) The nature of the selection, i.e., whether it should be 
considered final or tentative requiring additional hardware or cost 
definition.
    (3) A description of the role of the Principal Investigator 
including the responsibility for the provision of instruments for flight 
experiments.
    (3) Identification of the principal technical and management points 
to be treated in subsequent negotiations.
    (5) Any rights to be granted on use of data, publishing of data, and 
duration of use of the data.
    (6) Where applicable, indication that a foreign selectee's 
participation in the program will be arranged between the International 
Affairs Division, Office of External Relations, and the foreign 
government agency which endorsed the proposal.
    (c) In conjunction with the notification of successful foreign 
proposers, the Program Office shall forward a letter to the responsible 
International Affairs Division, Office of External Relations, addressing 
the following:
    (1) The scientific technological objective of the effort.
    (2) The period of time for the effort.
    (3) The responsibilities of NASA and of the sponsoring governmental 
agency; these may include:
    (i) Provision and disposition of hardware and software.
    (ii) Responsibilities for reporting, reduction and dissemination of 
data.
    (iii) Responsibilities for transportation of hardware.
    (4) Any additional information pertinent to the conduct of the 
experiment.
    (d) Using the information provided above, the International Affairs 
Division, Office of External Relations will negotiate an agreement with 
the sponsoring foreign agency.
    (e) Notices shall also be sent to those proposers not notified 
pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, and, as 
applicable, a copy to the sponsoring foreign government agency. It is 
important that these remaining proposers be informed at the same time as 
those selected. Other agency notifications and press release procedures 
will apply, as appropriate.


<R05>
1872.505  Debriefing.

    It is the policy to debrief, if requested, unsuccessful proposers of 
investigations in accordance with FAR 15.1004. The following shall be 
considered in arranging and conducting debriefings:
    (a) Debriefing shall be done by an official designated by the 
responsible Program AA. Any other personnel receiving requests for 
information concerning the rejection of a proposal shall refer to the 
designated official.
    (b) Debriefing of unsuccessful offerors shall be made at the 
earliest possible time; debriefing will generally be scheduled 
subsequent to selection but prior to award of contracts to the 
successful proposers.
    (c) Material discussed in debriefing shall be factual and consonant 
with the documented findings of several stages of the evaluation process 
and the selection statement.
    (d) The debriefing official shall advise of weak or deficient areas 
in the proposal, indicate whether those weaknesses were factors in the 
selection, and advise of the major considerations in selecting the 
competing successful proposer where appropriate.
    (e) The debriefing official shall not discuss other unsuccessful 
proposals, rankings, votes of members, or attempt to make a point-by-
point comparison with successful proposals.
    (f) A memorandum of record of the debriefing shall be provided the 
Chairperson of the Steering Committee.

<R04>
                   Subpart 1872.6--Payload Formulation


<R05>
1872.601  Payroll formulation.

    (a) Payload elements for Space Transportation System (STS) missions 
can come from many sources. These include those selected through AOs, 
those generated by in-house research, unsolicited proposals and those 
derived from agreements between NASA and external entities. However, it 
is anticipated that the primary source of NASA payload elements will be 
the AO process. Generally, proposals for payload elements submitted 
outside the AO process will not be selected if they would have been 
responsive to an AO objective.
    (b) Payload elements for STS flights fall into two major categories. 
``NASA or NASA-related'' payload elements are those which are developed 
by a NASA Program Office or by another party with which NASA has a 
shared interest. ``Non-NASA'' payload elements are those which require 
only STS operation services from NASA and interface with NASA through 
the Office of Space Flight.
    (c) In general, a Program Office will be designated responsibility 
for formulating the ``NASA or NASA-related'' portion of an STS payload. 
The Office of Space Flight will be responsible for formulating the 
``non-NASA'' portion of an STS payload. Flights may, of course, consist 
wholly of payload elements of either type. Resource allocation for mixed 
missions will be determined by the Program Office and the Office of 
Space Flight.


<R04>
          Subpart 1872.7--Acquisition and Other Considerations


<R05>
1872.701  Early involvement essential.

    (a) The distinctive feature of the AO process is that it is both a 
program planning system and an acquisition system in one procedure. The 
choice of what aeronautical and space phenomena to investigate is 
program planning. Acquisition is involved with the purchase of property 
and services to carry out the selected investigations.
    (b) Because of both the programmatic and multi-functional aspects of 
the AO process, early involvement of external program office elements is 
essential. Success of the process requires that it proceed in a manner 
that meets program goals and complies with statutory requirements and 
acquisition policy.
    (c) The planning, preparation and selection schedule for the 
investigation should commence early enough to meet statutory and 
regulatory requirements. Chief of these are the requirements for 
soliciting maximum feasible competition and for conducting discussions 
with offerors within the competitive range by the Project Office and/or 
any other evaluation group or office authorized by the selection 
official.


<R05>
1872.702  Negotiation, discussions, and contract award.

    (a) The AO shall be synopsized in the Commerce Business Daily. 
Responses to the synopsis must be added to the AO mailing list. Every 
effort should be made to publish opportunities far enough in advance to 
encourage a broad response. (In no case less than 45 days before the 
date set for receipt of proposals).
    (b) Significant items for consideration after receipt of proposals:
    (1) Late proposals--The policy on late proposals contained in 
1815.412 is applicable. Potential investigators should be informed of 
this policy. In the AO context, the selection official or designee will 
determine whether a late proposal will be considered.
    (2) Competitive considerations. (i) The proposals submitted in 
response to the AOs are not necessarily fully comparable. However, all 
proposals within the scope of an opportunity must be evaluated in 
accordance with the criteria in the AO.
    (ii) Cost must be considered in the evaluation if costs are involved 
in the investigation. General cost information should be given to the 
subcommittee by the Installation Project Office for use in determining 
the categories into which the subcommittee places proposals.
    (iii) Further information should be obtained, as necessary, by the 
Installation Project Office and/or any other

[[Page 441]]

evaluation group authorized by the selection official and from the 
investigators whose proposals are being considered. This is similar to 
the acquisition procedure for conducting written and oral discussions. A 
major consideration during discussions is to avoid unfairness and 
unequal treatment. Good judgment is required by in the extent and 
content of the discussions. There should be no reluctance in obtaining 
the advice and guidance of management and staff offices during the 
discussion phase. A summary should be prepared of the primary points 
covered in the written and oral discussions and show the effect of the 
discussions on the evaluation of proposals. This summary should also 
contain general information about the questions submitted to the 
investigators, the amount of time spent in oral discussion, and 
revisions in proposals, if any, resulting from the discussions.
    (iv) During the conduct of discussions, all proposers being 
considered shall be offered an equitable opportunity to submit cost, 
technical, or other revisions in their proposals as may result from the 
discussions. All proposers shall be informed that any revisions to their 
proposals must be submitted by a common cut-off date in order to be 
considered. The record should note compliance of the investigators with 
that cut-off date.
    (c) Significant items for consideration before award:
    (1) Issuance of a Request for Proposal (RFP)--A formal RFP should 
not be issued to obtain additional information on proposals accepted 
under the AO process. Additional technical, cost, or other data received 
should be considered as a supplement to the original proposal.
    (2) Selection of Investigator/Contractor--The selection decision of 
the Program AA approves the selected investigators and their 
institutions as the only satisfactory sources for the investigations. 
The selection of the investigator does not constitute the selection of 
that person's proposed supporting hardware fabricator unless the 
selection official specifically incorporates the fabricator in the 
selection decision.


<R05>
1872.703  Application of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the NASA FAR Supplement.

    The AO process supplants normal acquisition procedures only to the 
extent necessary to meet the distinctive features of the process. This 
process is not intended to conflict with any established statutory 
requirements.


<R05>
1872.704  Other administrative and functional requirements.

    After selection, all other applicable administrative and functional 
requirements will be complied with or incorporated in any resultant 
contract.


<R05>
1872.705  Format of Announcement of Opportunity (AO).

    Use the following format instructions when drafting AOs:

                      OMB Approval Number 2700-0085

              National Aeronautics and Space Administration

                          Washington, DC 20546

                       Announcement of Opportunity

AO No. ________________ (Issuance Date)


(Descriptive Heading)

                    I. Description of the Opportunity

    This section should set forth the basic purpose of the AO and 
describe the opportunity in terms of NASA's desire to obtain proposals 
which will meet the stated scientific, applications and/or technological 
objectives. These objectives may be directed to the generation of 
proposals for investigations and/or they may pertain to the acquisition 
of dissimilar ideas leading to selection of investigators, guest 
observers, guest investigators, or theorists. In those instances where 
proposals for investigations are sought, this section should describe 
the requirement, if any, for selected investigators to serve on advisory 
or working groups. In those instances where the project or program has 
not yet been approved, a qualifying statement should be included to 
indicate that this AO does not constitute an obligation for the 
Government to carry the effort to completion.

[[Page 442]]

                            II. AO Objectives

    This section will give a succinct statement of the specific 
scientific, applications, and/or technological objective(s) for the 
opportunity(s) for which proposals are sought.

                             III. Background

    This section should provide an explanation of the context of the 
opportunity, i.e., information which will help the reader understand the 
relevance of the opportunity.

                     IV. Proposal Opportunity Period

    This section should provide the proposal opportunity period(s). The 
following methods may be used individually or in conjunction for 
establishing the proposal opportunity period(s):
    (a) The AO may be issued establishing a single date by which 
proposals may be received. However, the AO could provide that the agency 
may amend the AO to provide for subsequent dates for submission of 
proposals, if additional investigations are desired.
    (b) The AO may be issued to provide for an initial submission date 
with the AO to remain open for submission of additional proposals up to 
a final cutoff date. This final date should be related to the 
availability of resources necessary to evaluate the continuous flow of 
proposals and the time remaining prior to the flight opportunities 
contemplated by the AO.
    (c) The AO may be issued establishing a number of dates by which 
proposals may be received. Normally no more than three proposal 
submission dates should be established. The submittal dates may be 
spread over the number of months most compatible with the possible 
flight opportunities and the availability of resources necessary to 
evaluate and fund the proposal. If desired, this section should further 
inform the reader that if a proposal receives a Category I, II, or III 
rating but is not selected for immediate support, the proposal may, if 
desired by the proposer, be held by NASA for later consideration within 
the ground rules set forth in paragraphs 1 and 2. The section should 
inform the reader that if the person wishes the proposal to be so 
treated, it should be indicated in the proposal. This section should 
further indicate that offerors whose proposals are to be considered at a 
later time will be given the opportunity to revalidate their proposals 
with their institution and update cost data.

                     V. Requirements and Constraints

    (a) This section will include technical, programmatic, cost, and 
schedule requirements or constraints, as applicable, and will specify 
performance limits such as lifetime, flight environment, safety, 
reliability, and quality assurance provisions for flight-worthiness. It 
will specify the requirements and constraints related to the flight crew 
and the ground support. It will also include requirements for data 
analysis, estimated schedule of data shipment to user for observer, need 
for preliminary or raw data analysis and interim reports. It will 
specify the planned period (time) for data analysis to be used for 
budgeting. It will provide any additional information necessary for a 
meaningful proposal.
    (b) When NASA determines that instrumentation, ground support 
equipment, or NASA supporting effort will be required or may be expected 
to be required by the contemplated investigations, the AO should 
indicate to the potential investigators that they must submit specific 
information regarding this requirement to allow an in-depth evaluation 
of the technical aspects, cost, management, and other factors by the 
Installation Project Office.

                   VI. Proposal Submission Information

    (a) Preproposal Activities--In this section, the AO will indicate 
requiremets and activities such as the following:
    (1) Submittal of ``Notice of Intent'' to propose (if desired), date 
for submission, and any additional required data to be submitted. 
Indicate whether there are information packages which will only be sent 
to those who submit ``Notice of Intent.''
    (2) Attendance at the preproposal conference (if held). Information 
should be provided as to time, place, whether attendance will be 
restricted in number from each institution, and

[[Page 443]]

whether prior notice of intention to attend is required. If desired, a 
request may be included that questions be submitted in writing several 
days before the conference in order to prepare replies.
    (3) The name and address of the scientific or technical contact for 
questions or inquiries.
    (4) Any other preproposal data considered necessary.
    (b) Format of Proposals--This section should provide the 
investigator with the information necessary to enable an effective 
evaluation of the proposal. The information is as follows:
    (1) Proposal--The AO should indicate how the proposal should be 
submitted to facilitate evaluation. The proposal should be submitted in 
at least two sections; (i) Investigation and Technical Section; and (ii) 
Management and Cost Section.
    (2) Signatory--The proposal must be signed by an institutional 
official authorized to ensure institutional support, sponsorship of the 
investigation, management, and financial aspects of the proposal.
    (3) Quantity--The number of copies of the proposal should be 
specified. One copy should be clear black and white, and on white paper 
of quality suitable for reproduction.
    (4) Submittal Address--Proposals from domestic sources should be 
mailed to arrive not later than the time indicated for receipt of 
proposals to:

   National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Office of (Program)

 Code___________________________________________________________________

 AO No._________________________________________________________________

Washington, DC 20546

    (5) Format--To aid in proposal evaluation, and to facilitate 
comparative analysis, a uniform proposal format will be required for 
each AO. The number of pages, page size, and restriction on photo 
reduction, etc., may be included. The format contained in Appendix C can 
be used as a guide. Proposers may be requested to respond to all of the 
items or the AO may indicate that only selected items need be addressed. 
Using the Appendix format as a guide, specific guidelines may be 
prepared for the AO or an appropriate form developed.
    (c) Additional Information--This section may be used to request or 
furnish data necessary to obtain clear proposals that should not require 
further discussions with the proposer by the evaluators. Other pertinent 
data could also be included, such as significant milestones.
    (d) Foreign Proposals--The procedures for submission of proposals 
from outside the U.S. are contained in Appendix B, ``General 
Instructions and Provisions.'' This section will describe any additional 
requirements, for example, if information copies of proposals are 
required to be furnished by the proposer to other organizations at the 
same time the proposal is submitted.
    (e) Cost Proposals (U.S. Investigators Only)--This section defines 
any special requirements regarding cost proposals of domestic 
investigators. Reference than should be made to the cost proposal 
certifications indicated in Appendix B, ``General Instructions and 
Provisions.''

         VII. Proposal Evaluation, Selection, and Implementation

    (a) Evaluation and Selection Procedure.
    (1) This section should notify the proposers of the evaluation 
process.
    (2) For example, a statement similar to the following should be 
included:
    ``Proposals received in response to this AO will be reviewed by a 
subcommittee appointed by the (appropriate Program AA). The purpose of 
the review is to determine the scientific/technical merit of the 
proposals in the context of this AO and so categorize the proposals. 
Those proposals with are considered to have the greatest scientific/
technical merit are further reviewed for engineering, integration, 
management, and cost aspects by the Project Office at the installation 
responsible for the project. On the basis of these reviews, and the 
reviews of the responsible Program Office and the Steering Committee, 
the (appropriate Program Associate Administrator) will appoint/select 
the investigators/investigations.''
    (b) Evaluation Criteria.

[[Page 444]]

    (1) This section should indicate that the selection proposals which 
best meet the specific scientific, applications, and/or technological 
objectives, stated in the AO, is the aim of the solicitation. This 
section should list the criteria to be used in the evaluation of 
proposals and indicate their relative importance. See NASA FAR 
Supplement 1872.402 for a listing of criteria generally appropriate.
    (2) This section will also inform the proposers that cost and 
management factors, e.g., proposed small business participation in 
instrumentation fabrication or investigation support, will be separately 
considered.

                             VIII. Schedule

    This section should include the following, as applicable:

1872.705-1 Appendix A:   General Instructions and Provisions

    Include the following in all Announcements of Opportunity:

               I. Instrumentation and/or Ground Equipment

    By submitting a proposal, the investigator and institution agree 
that NASA has the option to accept all or part of the offeror's plan to 
provide the instrumentation or ground support equipment required for the 
investigation or NASA may furnish or obtain such instrumentation or 
equipment from any other source as determined by the selecting official. 
In addition, NASA reserves the right to require use, by the selected 
investigator, of Government instrumentation or property that becomes 
available, with or without modification, that will meet the 
investigative objectives.

 II. Tentative Selections, Phased Development, Partial Selections, and 
                        Participation With Others

    By submitting a proposal, the investigator and the organization 
agree that NASA has the option to make a tentative selection pending a 
successful feasibility or definition effort. NASA has the option to 
contract in phases for a proposed experiment, and to discontinue the 
investigative effort at the completion of any phase. The investigator 
should also understand that NASA may desire to select only a portion of 
the proposed investigation and/or that NASA may desire the individual's 
participation with other investigators in a joint investigation, in 
which case the investigator will be given the opportunity to accept or 
decline such partial acceptance or participation with other 
investigators prior to a selection. Where participation with other 
investigators as a team is agreed to, one of the team members will 
normally be designated as its team leader or contact point.

                    III. Selection Without Discussion

    The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals 
received in response to this AO when such action shall be considered in 
the best interest of the Government. Notice is also given of the 
possibility that any selection may be made without discussion (other 
than discussions conducted for the purpose of minor clarification). It 
is therefore emphasized that all proposals should be submitted initially 
on the most favorable terms that the offeror can submit.

                          IV. Foreign Proposals

    See Appendix B, Management Plan and Cost Plan, paragraph (a)(3).

                      V. Treatment of Proposal Data

    It is NASA policy to use information contained in proposals and 
quotations for evaluation purposes only. While this policy does not 
require that the proposal or quotation bear a restrictive notice, 
offerors or quoters should place the following notice on the title page

[[Page 445]]

of the proposal or quotation and specify the information, subject to the 
notice by inserting appropriate identification, such as page numbers, in 
the notice. Information (data) contained in proposals and quotations 
will be protected to the extent permitted by law, but NASA assumes no 
liability for use and disclosure of information not made subject to the 
notice. To prevent inadvertent disclosure, proposal data shall not be 
included in submissions (e.g. final reports) that are routinely released 
to the public.

Restriction on Use and Disclosure of Proposal and Quotation Information 
                                 (Data)

    The information (data) contained in [insert page numbers or other 
identification] of this proposal or quotation constitutes a trade secret 
and/or information that is commercial or financial and confidential or 
privileged. It is furnished to the Government in confidence with the 
understanding that it will not, without permission of the offeror, be 
used or disclosed for other than evaluation purposes; provided, however, 
that in the event a contract is awarded on the basis of this proposal or 
quotation the Government shall have the right to use and disclose this 
information (data) to the extent provided in the contract. This 
restriction does not limit the Government's right to use or disclose 
this information (data) if obtained from another source without 
restriction.

           VI. Status of Cost Proposals (U.S. Proposals Only)

    The investigator's institution agrees that the cost proposal is for 
proposal evaluation and selection purposes, and that following selection 
and during negotiations leading to a definitive contract, the 
institution may be required to resubmit cost information in accordance 
with FAR 15.8.

                           VII. Late Proposals

    The Government reserves the right to consider proposals or 
modifications thereof received after the date indicated, should such 
action be in the interest of the Government.

       VIII. Source of Space Transportation System Investigations

    Investigators are advised that candidate investigations for Space 
Transportation System (STS) missions can come from many sources.

             IX. Disclosure of Proposals Outside Government

    NASA may find it necessary to obtain proposal evaluation assistance 
outside the Government. Where NASA determines it is necessary to 
disclose a proposal outside the Government for evaluation purposes, 
arrangements will be made with the evaluator for appropriate handling of 
the proposal information. Therefore, by submitting a proposal the 
investigator and institution agree that NASA may have the proposal 
evaluated outside the Government. If the investigator or institution 
desire to preclude NASA from using an outside evaluation, the 
investigator or institution should so indicate on the cover. However, 
notice is given that if NASA is precluded from using outside evaluation, 
it may be unable to consider the proposal.

               X. Equal Opportunity (U.S. Proposals Only)

    By submitting a proposal, the investigator and institution agree to 
accept the following clause in any resulting contract:

                            Equal Opportunity

    During the performance of this contract, the Contractor agrees as 
follows:
    (a) The Contractor will not discriminate against any employee or 
applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, sex, or 
national origin.
    (b) The Contractor will take affirmative action to ensure that 
applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during

accounts by the contracting agency or the Office of Federal Contract 
Compliance Programs (OFCCP) for the purposes of investigation to 
ascertain the Contractor's compliance with the applicable rules, 
regulations, and orders.
    (i) If the OFCCP determines that the Contractor is not in compliance 
with this clause or any rule, regulation, or order of the Secretary of 
Labor, the contract may be canceled, terminated, or suspended in whole 
or in part, and the Contractor may be declared ineligible for further 
Government contracts, under the procedures authorized in Executive Order 
11246, as amended. In addition, sanctions may be imposed and remedies 
invoked against the Contractor as provided in Executive Order 11246, as 
amended, the rules, regulations, and orders of the Secretary of Labor, 
or as otherwise provided by law.
    (j) The Contractor shall include the terms and conditions of 
subparagraph 1 through 9 of this clause in every subcontract or purchase 
order that is not exempted by the rules, regulations, or orders of the 
Secretary of Labor issued under Executive Order 11246, as amended, so 
that these terms and conditions will be binding upon each subcontractor 
or vendor.
    (k) The Contractor shall take such action with respect to any 
subcontract or purchase order as the contracting agency may direct as a 
means of enforcing these terms and conditions, including sanctions for 
non-compliance; provided, that if the Contractor becomes involved in, or

NASA's AO. Unless otherwise indicated in a specific announcement, these 
guidelines indicate the appropriate measures to be taken by foreign 
proposers, prospective foreign sponsoring agencies, and NASA leading to 
the selection of a proposal and execution of appropriate arrangements. 
They include the following:
    (i) Where a ``Notice of Intent'' to propose is requested, 
prospective foreign proposers should write directly to the NASA official 
designated in the AO and

[[Page 449]]

send a copy of this letter to the International Relations Division, 
Office of External Relations, Code IR, NASA, Washington, DC 20546, 
U.S.A.
    (ii) Unless otherwise indicated in the AO, proposals will be 
submitted in accordance with this Appendix excluding cost plans. 
Proposals should be typewritten and written in English.
    (iii) Persons planning to submit a proposal should arrange with an 
appropriate foreign governmental agency for a review and endorsement of 
the proposed activity. Such endorsement by a foreign organization 
indicates that the proposal merits careful consideration by NASA and 
that, if the proposal is selected, sufficient funds will be available to 
undertake the activity envisioned.
    (iv) Proposals including the requested number of copies and letters 
of endorsement from the foreign governmental agency must be forwarded to 
NASA in time to arrive before the deadline established for each AO.

    (v) Those proposals received after the closing date will be treated 
in accordance with NASA's provisions for late proposals. Sponsoring 
foreign government agencies may, in exceptional situations, forward a 
proposal directly to the above address if review and endorsement is not 
possible before the announced closing date. In such cases, NASA should 
be advised when a decision on endorsement can be expected.
    (vi) Shortly after the deadline for each AO, NASA's International 
Relations Division will be advised the appropriate sponsoring agency 
which proposals have been received and when the selection process should 
be completed. A copy of this acknowledgment will be provided to each 
proposer.
    (vii) Successful and unsuccessful proposers will be contacted 
directly by the NASA Program Officer coordinating the AO. Copies of 
these letters will be sent to the sponsoring Government agency.
    (viii) NASA's International Relations Division will then begin 
making the arrangements to provide for the selectee's participation in 
the appropriate NASA program. Depending on the nature and extent of the 
proposed cooperation, these arrangements may entail:
    (A) A letter of notification by NASA.
    (B) An exchange of letters between NASA and the sponsoring foreign 
governmental agency.
    (C) An agreement or Memorandum of Understanding between NASA and the 
sponsoring foreign governmental agency.

                (b) Cost Plan (U.S. Investigations Only)

    The cost plan should summarize the total investigation cost by major 
categories of cost as well as by function.
    (1) The categories of cost should include the following:
    (i) Director Labor--List by labor category, with labor hours and 
rates for each. Provide actual salaries of all personnel and the 
percentage of time each individual will devote to the effort.
    (ii) Overhead--Include indirect costs. Usually this is in the form 
of a percentage of the direct labor costs.
    (iii) Materials--This should give the total cost of the bill of 
materials including estimated cost of each major item. Include lead time 
of critical items.
    (iv) Subcontracts--List those over $25,000, specify the vendor and

<R05>
1901.000  Scope of part.

<R04>
              Subpart 1901.1--Purpose, Authority, Issuance


<R05>
1901.101  Purpose.

    This subpart establishes the United States Information Agency 
Acquisition Regulation (IAAR) as Chapter 19 of the Federal Acquisition 
Regulations System (48 CFR chapter 19) and states the relationship of 
the IAAR to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 CFR chapter 1.


<R05>
1901.102  Authority.

    The USIA Acquisition Regulation is prescribed by the Director of the 
United States Information Agency pursuant to the authority of the 
Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1977 and the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, and other applicable 
law.


<R05>
1901.103  Applicability.

    Except where a deviation is specifically authorized in accordance 
with subpart 1901.4 or otherwise authorized by law, the FAR and the IAAR 
govern all USIA acquisitions within the United States.


<R05>
1901.104  Issuance.


<R05>
1901.104-1  Publication and code arrangement.

    (b) The IAAR is issued as chapter 19 of title 48, CFR.


<R05>
1901.104-2  Arrangement of regulations.

    The IAAR uses the same numbering system and arrangement used in the 
FAR. Where the IAAR implements the FAR, it is numbered and captioned to 
correspond to the FAR. Where there is no corresponding material in the 
FAR, numbers beginning with 70 or higher are assigned to the IAAR 
supplementing part. Where the subject matter is the FAR requires no 
implementation, the IAAR contains no corresponding part.


<R04>
                 Subpart 1901.4--Deviations From the FAR


<R05>

<R05>
1901.601  General.

                       Owned or Controlled by Them


<R05>
1903.602  Exceptions.

    To avoid potential conflicts of interest or the appearance of 
preferential treatment, it is USIA policy not to award contracts, 
purchase orders, grants or cooperative agreements to Government 
employees or their family members or business concerns owned or 
controlled by Government employees or their family members. Exceptions 
to this policy must be approved by the Agency Director or Agency 
Procurement Executive and supported by written Findings and 
Determination. A contract with an employee for services may result in 
violation of the dual salary compensation statutes (5 U.S.C. 5533). 
Nothing in this paragraph is intended to render inapplicable the 
conflict of interest prohibition set out in 18 U.S.C. 208.


<R05>
1903.670  Contracts between USIA and former employees.

    To avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance of preferential 
treatment, purchase orders, contracts, grants or cooperative agreements 
with former employees of USIA, or with firms in which former employees 
or their family members are known to have controlling interest, may be 
entered into within two years following separation from employment only 
with the written approval of the Agency Director. A written 
justification shall be made a part of the file. The justification must 
address the issue of conflict of interest and conclude that it does not 
exist; or that in spite of its existence, the Agency's ability to meet 
its mission would be seriously harmed without the award.

<R05>
1904.7001  General.

    (a) Procurement requests will be prepared and submitted to the 
contracting office in accordance with Agency procedures.
    (b) Except in unusual circumstances, the contracting office will not 
issue solicitations until an approved procurement request, containing a 
certification that funds are available, has been received. However, the 
contracting office may take all necessary actions up to the point of 
contract award prior to the receipt of the approved procurement request 
certifying that funds are available when:
    (1) Such action is necessary to meet critical program schedules;
    (2) It has been established that program authority has been issued 
and that funds to cover the acquisition will be available prior to the 
date set for contract award or contract modification;
    (3) A person at a level above the contracting officer authorizes 
such action prior to the issuance of the solicitation, and the contract 
file is properly documented; and
    (4) The solicitation document clearly indicates that the award is 
subject to the availability of funds.
    (c) The procurement request shall be assigned within the contracting 
office to an individual who, if not the contracting officer, will be 
responsible to the contracting officer for conducting the business 
aspects of the transaction. This individual shall review the request to 
ensure that it complies with the FAR and this Regulation and that the 
information contained in the request is in sufficient detail to prepare 
presolicitation and solicitation documents. The contracting officer, or 
other designated individual in the contracting office, shall discuss 
uncertain requirements or inconsistencies in the procurement request 
with the initiator of the request and obtain clarification prior to 
taking any further action.

<R04>
        Subpart 1909.4--Debarment, Suspension, and Ineligibility


<R05>
1909.403  Definitions.

    The Agency Procurement Executive, is designated the ``debarring 
official'' and the ``suspending official'' as defined in FAR 9.403 and 
is designated as the agency official authorized to make the decisions 
required in FAR 9.405(a), 9.405-1(b), 9.405-2, 9.406-1(c), and 9.407-
1(d).

    (a) The Policy and Procedures Staff, Office of Contracts, shall be 
responsible for the maintenance and distribution of the GSA Consolidated 
List of Debarred, Suspended, and Ineligible Contractors. It will be 
coordinated with the Solicitation Mailing List and appropriate notations 
will be made on both lists, when additions or deletions are necessary. 
Contracting Officers shall notify the Policy and Procedures Staff, 
Office of Contracts, of their distribution needs and shall ensure the 
list is used effectively.
    (b) The Agency Procurement Executive (or designee) is responsible 
for notifying GSA of the information required by FAR 9.404(b).


<R05>
1909.406  Debarment, suspension, and ineligibility.


<R05>
1909.406-3  Procedures.

    (a) Investigation and referral. Any officer of the Agency who 
becomes aware of circumstances which may serve as a basis for a 
debarment, suspension, or ineligibility shall report the circumstances 
by memorandum to the Agency Procurement Executive for consideration of 
debarment, suspension or ineligibility action.
    (b) Decision-making process. (1) Contractors shall be given the 
opportunity to submit, in person, in writing, or through a 
representative, information and arguments in opposition to a proposed 
debarment or suspension. All rebuttals shall be addressed to the Agency 
Procurement Executive. However, if a response to the proposed debarment 
or suspension is not received by the Agency Procurement Executive within 
30 calendar days of receipt of the notice, the debarment or suspension 
shall become final.
    (2) If a contractor, or a representative, desires to present 
information and arguments in person to the Agency Procurement Executive, 
an oral presentation will be held within 20 calendar days of receipt of 
the request, unless a longer period of time is requested by the 
contractor. Hearings will be held before a three-person fact-finding 
board composed of one member each from the Office of General Counsel and 
Congressional Liaison, the Bureau of Management, and the Office of 
Contracts, other than the initiating officer. The fact-finding board 
shall deliver written findings to the Agency Procurement Executive 
(together with a transcription of the proceedings, if made) within 10 
calendar days after the hearing. The findings shall resolve any facts in 
dispute based on a preponderance of the evidence presented and determine 
whether a cause for debarment or suspension exists.
    (c) Debarring/suspending official's decision. The debarring/
suspending official's final decision shall be made in

[[Page 458]]

writing in accordance with FAR 9.406-3 and notice of the decision will

<R05>
1910.004-70  Brand name products or equal.

    (a) General. Consistent with the policy stated in FAR 10.004(a)(2), 
USIA acquisitions will generally not be based on a specifically 
identified product or feature(s) thereof. However, under unusual 
circumstances such an approach may be used as described below.
    (b) Citing brand name products. Brand name or equal purchase 
descriptions shall cite all brand name products known to be acceptable 
and of current manufacture. If the use of a brand name or equal purchase 
description results in the purchase of an acceptable brand name product 
which was not listed as an ``equal'' product, a reference to that brand 
name product should be included in the purchase description for later 
acquisitions. If a brand name product is no longer applicable, the 
reference thereto shall be deleted from subsequent purchase description.
    (c) Specifying essential characteristics. (1) It is imperative that 
brand name or equal purchase descriptions specify each physical or 
functional characteristic of the product that is essential to the 
intended use. Failure to do so may result in a defective solicitation 
and the necessity to resolicit the requirements. (See 1910.004-73.) Care 
must be taken to avoid specifying characteristics that cannot be shown 
to materially affect the intended end use and which unnecessarily 
restrict competition.
    (2) When describing essential characteristics, permissible 
tolerances should be indicated. Avoid specifying a characteristic (e.g., 
a specific dimension) of a brand name product unless it is essential to 
the Government's need. The contracting officer must be able to justify 
the requirement.


<R05>
1910.004-71  Limits on the use of brand name or equal purchase descriptions.

    (a) General. The use of brand name or equal purchase descriptions in 
solicitations is intended to promote competition by encouraging the 
offering of products that are equal in all material respects to brand 
name products cited in such descriptions. Identification by brand name 
does not indicate a preference for the products mentioned but indicates 
the quality and characteristics of products that will meet the 
Government's needs. Where a component of an item is described in the 
solicitation by a brand name or equal purchase description and the 
contracting officer determines that application of the provision of 
1952.210-70 would be impracticable, the requirement to include the entry 
described in 1910.004-72(a) shall not apply. If the provision is 
included in the solicitation for other reasons, there also shall be 
included in the solicitation a statement to identify either the 
component parts (described by brand name or equal descriptions) to which 
the provision applies or those to which it does not apply. This also 
applies to accessories related to an end item where a brand name or 
equal purchase description of the accessories is a part of the 
description of an end item. Brand name or equal descriptions shall not 
be used to acquire a particular product under the guise of competitive 
acquisition to the exclusion of other products that would meet the 
actual needs.
    (b) In small purchases within the open market limitations, brand 
name policies and procedures shall be applicable to the extent 
practicable.

[[Page 459]]

    (c) Approval required. A brand name or equal purchase description 
shall not be used unless it has been approved at one level above the 
contracting officer.


<R05>
1910.004-72  Solicitations, brand name or equal descriptions.

    (a) An entry substantially as follows shall be prominently inserted 
in the item listing after each item or component part of an end item to 
which a brand name or equal purchase description applies.

    Bidding on:

 Manufacturer's Name:___________________________________________________
 Brand:_________________________________________________________________
 No.:___________________________________________________________________

    (b) Because bidders frequently overlook the requirements of the 
clause at 1952.210-70 ``Brand Name or Equal,'' the following note shall 
be inserted in the item listing after each brand name or equal item (or 
component part), or at the bottom of each page, listing several such 
items, or in a manner that may otherwise direct the offeror's attention 
to this clause.

    Offerors offering other than brand name items identified herein 
should furnish with their offers adequate information to ensure that a 
determination can be made as to equality of the product(s) offered (see 
the provision ``Brand Name or Equal'' set forth in 1952.210-70 of the 
solicitation).

    (c) If offeror samples are requested for brand name or equal 
acquisitions, the above notice shall not be included in the 
solicitation.


<R05>
1910.004-73  Offer evaluation and award, brand name or equal descriptions.

    An offer may not be rejected for failure of the offered product to 
equal a characteristic of a brand name product if it was not specified 
in the brand name or equal description. However, if it is clearly 
established that the unspecified characteristic is essential to the 
intended end use, the solicitation is defective and no award may be 
made. In such cases, the contracting officer should resolicit the 
requirements, using a purchase description that sets forth the essential 
characteristics.


<R05>
1910.004-74  Procedure for negotiated procurements and small purchases.

    (a) The policies and procedures prescribed for sealed bid 
procurements shall be generally applicable to negotiated procurements.
    (b) The clause set forth at 1952.210-70 may be adapted for use in 
negotiated procurements. If use of the clause is not practicable (as may 
be the case in unusual and compelling urgency purchases), suppliers 
shall be suitably informed that proposals offering products different 
from the products referenced by brand name will be considered if the 
contracting officer determines that the offered products meet fully the 
salient characteristics requirements of the solicitation.
    (c) In small purchases within open-market limitations, such policies 
and procedures shall be applicable to the extent practicable.


<R05>
1910.011  Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.

    The Contracting Officer shall include the provision at 1952.210-70, 
Brand Name or Equal, in solicitations for which brand name or equal 
purchase is used.

contract, must be in writing, and shall define the scope and limitations 
of the AR/CO's authority. The instrument designating an AR/CO shall not 
contain authority to sign or agree to any contract or major modification 
to a contract. Contractual commitments shall be made only by a duly

<R04>
              Subpart 2001.1--Purpose, Authority, Issuance


<R05>
2001.101  Purpose.

    This subpart establishes chapter 20, the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission Acquisition Regulation (NRCAR), and provides for the 
codification and publication of uniform policies and procedures for 
acquisitions by the NRC. The NRCAR is not, by itself, a complete 
document. It must be used in conjunction with the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR Chapter 1).


<R05>
2001.102  Authority.

    The NRCAR and the amendments to it are issued by the Director, 
Office of Administration, under a delegation from the Executive Director 
for Operations in accordance with the authority of the Atomic Energy Act 
of 1954, as amended (42. U.S.C. 161), the Energy Reorganization Act of 
1974 (42 U.S.C. 5841, 5872), the Federal Property and Administrative 
Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 486(c)), as amended, FAR Subpart 1.3, 
and other applicable law.


<R05>
2001.103  Applicability.

    The FAR and NRCAR apply to all NRC acquisitions of supplies and 
services which obligate appropriated funds, except as exempted by 
Sections 31 and 161 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 as amended, and 
Section 205 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 as amended. For 
procurements made from nonappropriated funds, the Director, Division of 
Contracts and Property Management, shall determine the rules and 
procedures that apply.


<R05>
2001.104  Issuance.


<R05>
2001.104-1  Publication and code arrangement.

    (a) The NRCAR and its subsequent changes are:
    (1) Published in the daily issue of the Federal Register; and
    (2) Codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).
    (b) The NRCAR is issued as 48 CFR Chapter 20.


<R05>
2001.104-2  Arrangement of the regulations.

    (a) General. Chapter 20 is divided into parts, subparts, sections, 
subsections, paragraphs, and further subdivisions as necessary.
    (b) Numbering. The numbering system and part, subpart and section 
titles used in this chapter 20 conform with those used in the FAR as 
follows:
    (1) Where chapter 20 implements the FAR or supplements a parallel 
part,

[[Page 468]]

subpart, section, or paragraph of the FAR, that implementation or 
supplementation is numbered and captioned to the FAR part, subpart, 
section, or subsection being implemented or supplemented, except that 
the implementation or supplementation is preceded with a 20 or 200 so 
that there will always be four numbers to the left of the decimal. For 
example, NRC's implementation of FAR 1.104-1 is shown as 2001.104-1 and 
the NRC's implementation of FAR 24.1 is shown as 2024.1.
    (2) When NRC supplements material contained in the FAR, it is given 
a unique number containing the numerals ``70'' or higher. The rest of 
the number parallels the FAR part, subpart, section, subsection, or 
paragraph it is supplementing. For example, Section 170A of the Atomic 
Energy Act of 1954, as amended, requires a more comprehensive 
organizational conflict of interest review for NRC than is contemplated 
by FAR 9.5. This supplementary material is identified as 2009.570.
    (3) Where material in the FAR requires no implementation or 
supplementation, there is no corresponding numbering in the NRCAR. 
Therefore, there may be gaps in the NRCAR sequence of numbers where the 
FAR requires no further implementation.
    (c) Citation. The NRCAR will be cited in accordance with Federal 
Register Standards approved for the FAR. Thus, this section when 
referred to in the NRCAR is cited as 2001.104-2(c). When this section is 
referred to formally in official documents, such as legal briefs, it 
should be cited as ``48 CFR 2001.104-2(c).'' Any section of the NRCAR 
may be formally identified by the section number, e.g., ``NRCAR 
2001.104-2.'' In the NRCAR, any reference to the FAR will be indicated 
by ``FAR'' followed by the section number, for example FAR 1-104.


<R05>
2001.104-3  Copies.

    Copies of the NRCAR in Federal Register and CFR form may be 
purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing 
Office, Washington, DC 20402.


<R05>
2001.105  Information collection requirements: OMB approval.

    (a) The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has submitted the information 
collection requirements contained in this part to the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) for approval as required by the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.).
    (b) The information collection requirements contained in this part 
appear in 2009.570-3(b)(1)&(2), 2009.570-3(c), 2009.570-3(c)(4)(ii),

<R04>
             Subpart 2001.3--Agency Acquisition Regulations


<R05>
2001.301  Policy.

    Policy, procedures, and guidance of an internal nature will be 
promulgated through internal NRC issuances such as Management 
Directives, or Division of Contracts and Property Management 
Instructions.


<R05>
2001.303  Public participation.

    FAR 1.301 and Section 22 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy 
Act, as amended (41 U.S.C. 418b) require rulemaking for substantive 
acquisition rules, but allow discretion in the matter for other than 
significant issues meeting the stated criteria. Accordingly, the NRCAR 
has been promulgated and may be revised from time to time in accordance 
with FAR 1.301. This procedure for significant subject matter generally 
involves issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking, inviting public 
comment, review and analysis of comments received, and publication of a 
final rule. The final rule includes a discussion of the public comments 
received and describes any changes made as a result of the comments.

[[Page 469]]


<R04>
          Subpart 2001.4--Deviations From the FAR and the NRCAR


<R05>
2001.402  Policy.

    (a) Requests for authority to deviate from the provisions of the FAR 
or the NRCAR must be signed by the requesting office and submitting to 
the Director, Division of Contracts and Property Management, in writing 
as far in advance as possible. Each request for deviation must contain 
the following:
    (1) A statement of the deviation desired, including identification 
of the specific paragraph number(s) of the FAR or NRCAR from which a 
deviation is requested;
    (2) The reason why the deviation is considered necessary or would be 
in the best interest of the Government;
    (3) If applicable, the name of the contractor and identification of 
the contract affected;
    (4) A statement as to whether the deviation has been requested 
previously and, if so, circumstances of the previous request (including 
the result of that request);
    (5) A description of the intended effect of the deviation;
    (6) A statement of the period of time for which the deviation is 
needed; and
    (7) Any pertinent background information which will contribute to a 
full understanding of the desired deviation.


<R05>
2001.403  Individual deviations.

    In individual cases, deviations from either the FAR or the NRCAR 
will be authorized only when essential to effect a necessary acquisition 
or where special circumstances make the deviations clearly in the best 
interest of the Government. Individual deviations must be authorized in 
advance by the Director, Division of Contracts and Property Management.


<R05>
2001.404  Class deviations.

    Where deviations from the FAR or NRCAR are considered necessary for 
classes of contracts, requests for authority to deviate must be 
submitted in writing to the Director, Division of Contracts and Property 
Management, who will consider the submission jointly with the 
Chairperson of the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council, as appropriate.


<R04>
       Subpart 2001.6--Contracting Authority and Responsibilities


<R05>
2001.600-70  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart deals with the placement of contracting authority and 
responsibility within the agency, the selection and designation of 
contracting officers, and the authority of contracting officers.


<R05>
2001.601  General.

    (a) Contracting authority vests in the Chairman. The Chairman has 
delegated this authority to the Executive Director for Operations (EDO). 
The EDO has delegated this authority to the Director, Office of 
Administration (ADM). The Director, ADM, has delegated the authority to 
the Director, Division of Contracts and Property Management, who, in 
turn, makes contracting officer appointments within the Headquarters and 
Regional Offices. All of the above delegations are formal written 
delegations containing dollar limitations and conditions.
    (b) The Director, Division of Contracts and Property Management, 
establishes contracting policy throughout the agency; monitors the 
overall effectiveness and efficiency of the agency's contracting office; 
establishes controls to assure compliance with laws, regulations, and 
procedures; and delegates contracting officer authority.


<R05>
2001.602-3  Ratification of unauthorized commitments.

    (a) The Government is not bound by agreements or contractual 
commitments made to prospective contractors by persons to whom 
contracting authority has not been delegated. Any unauthorized 
commitment may be in violation of the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act, other Federal laws, the FAR, the NRCAR, and 
good acquisition practice. Certain requirements of law and regulation 
necessary for the proper establishment of a contractual obligation may 
not be met under an unauthorized commitment; for example, the 
certification of the availability of funds, justification for other than 
full and open competition, competition of sources, determination of 
contractor responsibility,

[[Page 470]]

certification of current pricing data, price/cost analysis, 
administrative approvals, and negotiation of appropriate contract 
clauses.
    (b) The execution of otherwise proper contracts made by individuals 
without contracting authority, or by contracting officers in excess of 
the limits of their delegated authority, may later be ratified. To be 
effective, the ratification must be in the form of a written procurement 
document clearly stating that ratification of a previously unauthorized 
commitment is intended. All ratifications must be approved by the 
Competition Advocate except that ratifications of procurement actions 
valued at $2,500 or less may be approved by the appropriate Regional 
Administrator or at a level above the appropriate Headquarters 
Contracting Officer. For any such action approved by the Regional

concerning the commitment and a complete written statement of facts, 
including, but not limited to:
    (i) A statement as to why the contracting office was not used 
including the name of the employee who made the commitment:
    (ii) A statement as to why the proposed contractor was selected;
    (iii) A list of other sources considered;
    (iv) A description of work to be performed or products to be

    (v) The estimated or agreed upon contract price;
    (vi) A certification of the appropriated funds available;
    (vii) A statement of whether the contractor has commenced 
performance; and
    (viii) A description of how unauthorized commitments in similar 
circumstances will be avoided in the future.
    (2) The contracting officer shall review and forward the written 
statement of facts for a determination of approval to the Competition 
Advocate DCPM, with any comments or information which should be 
considered in evaluating the request for ratification.
    (3) The NRC legal advisor may be asked for an opinion, advice, or 
concurrence if there is concern regarding the propriety of the funding 
source, appropriateness of the expense, or when some other legal issue 
is involved.

<R04>
           Subpart 2009.1--Responsible Prospective Contractors


<R05>
2009.101  NRC policy.

    (a) It is NRC policy that contracts will not normally be placed on a 
noncompetitive basis with an individual who was employed by the NRC 
within two years of the date of the request for procurement action. This 
policy also pertains to any firm in which a former NRC employee is a 
partner, principal officer, majority stockholder, or which is otherwise 
controlled or predominantly staffed by former NRC employees and for 
granting consent of subcontracts. An exception to this policy will be 
made if it is determined by the agency Procurement Executive to be in 
the best interest of the Government to do so. This restriction also 
applies to former NRC employees acting as a principal under a task order 
type contract or as a principal under a contract awarded non-
competitively under the Small Business Administration's 8(a) Program. 
This policy is also applied when reviewing subcontracts for the purpose 
of granting consent under NRC prime contracts.

[[Page 473]]

    (b) The term NRC employee includes special Government employees 
performing services for NRC as experts, advisors, consultants, or 
members of advisory committees, if--
    (1) The contract arises directly out of the individual's activity as 
a special employee;
    (2) The individual is in a position to influence the award of the 
contract; or
    (3) The Contracting Officer determines that another conflict of 
interest exists.
    (c) A justification explaining why it is in the best interest of the 
Government to contract with an individual or firm described in paragraph 
(a) of this section on a noncompetitive basis may be approved by the 
Procurement Executive after consulting with the Executive Director for 
Operations or his designee. This is in addition to any justification and 
approvals which may be required by the FAR for use of other than full 
and open competition.
    (d) Nothing in this policy statement shall be construed as relieving 
former employees from obligations prescribed by law, such as 18 U.S.C. 
207, Disqualification of Former Officers and Employees.


<R05>
2009.105-70  Contract provisions.

    The contracting officer shall insert the following provisions in all 
solicitations:
    (a) Section 2052.209-70, Qualifications of Contract Employees.
    (b) Section 2052.209-71 , Current/Former Agency Employee 
Involvement.


<R04>
        Subpart 2009.4--Debarment, Suspension, and Ineligibility


<R05>
2009.403  Definitions.

    As used in 2009.4:
    Debarring official means the Procurement Executive.
    Initiating official means the contracting officer, the Head of the 
Contracting Activity (HCA), the Procurement Executive, or the Inspector 
General.
    Suspending official means the Procurement Executive.


<R05>
2009.404  Consolidated list of parties excluded from Federal procurement or non-procurement programs.

    The contracting officer responsible for the contract affected by the 
debarment or suspension shall perform the actions required by FAR 
9.404(c)(1)-(3).


<R05>
2009.405  Effect of listing.

    Compelling reasons are considered to be present where failure to 
contract with the debarred or suspended contractor would seriously harm 
the agency's programs and prevent accomplishment of mission 
requirements. The Procurement Executive is authorized to make the 
determinations under FAR 9.405. Requests for these determinations must 
be submitted through the HCA to the Procurement Executive.


<R05>
2009.405-1  Continuation of current contracts.

    The HCA is authorized to make the determinations under FAR 9.405-1.


<R05>
2009.405-2  Restrictions on subcontracting.

    The HCA is authorized to approve subcontracts with debarred or 
suspended subcontractors under FAR 9.405-2.


<R05>
2009.406  Debarment.


<R05>
2009.406-3  Procedures.

    (a) Investigation and referral. When a contracting officer becomes 
aware of possible irregularities or any information which may be 
sufficient cause for debarment, the case must be referred through the 
HCA to the Procurement Executive immediately. The case must be 
accompanied by a complete statement of the facts (including a copy of 
any criminal indictments, if applicable) along with a recommendation for 
action. Where the statement of facts indicates the irregularities to be 
possible criminal offenses, or for any other reason further 
investigation is considered necessary, the matter must first be referred 
to the HCA who will consult with the Office of the Inspector General to 
determine if further investigation is required prior to referring to the 
debarring official.
    (b) Decision-making process. If, after reviewing the recommendations 
and

[[Page 474]]

consulting with the Office of the General Counsel and, if appropriate, 
the Office of the Inspector General, the debarring official determines 
debarment is justified, the debarring official shall initiate the 
proposed debarment in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) and notify the HCA 
of the action taken. If the contractor fails to submit a timely written 
response within 30 days after receipt of the notice, the debarring 
official may notify the contractor in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(d) 
that the contractor is debarred.
    (c) Fact-finding proceedings. For actions listed under FAR 9.406-
3(b)(2), the contractor shall be given the opportunity to appear at an 
informal hearing. The hearing should be held at a location and time that 
is convenient to the parties concerned, and no later than 30 days after 
the contractor received the notice, if at all possible. The contractor 
and any specifically named affiliates may be represented by counsel or 
any duly authorized representative. Witnesses may be called by either 
party. The proceedings must be conducted expeditiously and in such a 
manner that each party will have an opportunity to present all 
information considered pertinent to the proposed debarment.


<R05>
2009.407  Suspension.


<R05>
2009.407-3  Procedures.

    (a) Investigation and referral. When a contracting officer becomes 
aware of possible irregularities or any information which may be 
sufficient cause for suspension, the case must be referred through the 
HCA to the Procurement Executive immediately. The case must be 
accompanied by a complete statement of the facts along with a 
recommendation for action. Where the statement of facts indicates the 
irregularities to be possible criminal offenses, or for any other reason 
further investigation is considered necessary, the matter must first be 
referred to the HCA who will consult with the Office of the Inspector 
General to determine if further investigation is required prior to 
referring the matter to the suspending official.
    (b) Decision-making process. If, after reviewing the recommendations 
and consulting with the Office of the General Counsel, and if 
appropriate, the Office of the Inspector General, the suspending 
official determines suspension is justified, the suspending official 
shall initiate the proposed suspension in accordance with FAR 9.407-
3(b)(2). The contractor shall be given the opportunity to appear at an 
informal hearing, similar in nature to the hearing for debarments as 
discussed in FAR 9.406-3(b)(2). If the contractor fails to submit a 
timely written response within 30 days after receipt of the notice, the 
suspending official may notify the contractor in accordance with 9.407-
3(d) that the contractor is suspended.


<R05>
2009.470  Appeals.

    A debarred or suspended contractor may appeal the debarring/
suspending official's decision by mailing or otherwise furnishing a 
written notice within 90 days from the date of the decision to the 
Executive Director for Operations. A copy of the notice of appeal must 
be furnished to the debarring/suspending official from whose decision 
the appeal is taken.


<R04>
          Subpart 2009.5--Organizational Conflicts of Interest


<R05>
2009.500  Scope of subpart.

    In accordance with 42 U.S.C. 2210a., NRC acquisitions are processed 
in accordance with 2009.570, which takes precedence over FAR 9.5 with 
respect to organizational conflicts of interest. Where non-conflicting 
guidance appears in FAR 9.5, that guidance must be followed.


<R05>
2009.570  NRC organizational conflicts of interest.


<R05>
2009.570-1  Scope of policy.

    (a) It is the policy of NRC to avoid, eliminate, or neutralize 
contractor organizational conflicts of interest. The NRC achieves this 
objective by requiring all prospective contractors to submit information 
describing relationships, if any, with organizations or persons 
(including those regulated by the NRC) which may give rise to actual or 
potential conflicts of interest in the event of contract award.

[[Page 475]]

    (b) Contractor conflict of interest determinations cannot be made 
automatically or routinely. The application of sound judgment on 
virtually a case-by-case basis is necessary if the policy is to be 
applied to satisfy the overall public interest. It is not possible to 
prescribe in advance a specific method or set of criteria which would 
serve to identify and resolve all of the contractor conflict of interest 
situations which might arise. However, examples are provided in these 
regulations to guide application of this policy guidance. The ultimate 
test is as follows: Might the contractor, if awarded the contract, be 
placed in a position where its judgment may be biased, or where it may 
have an unfair competitive advantage?
    (c) The conflict of interest rule contained in this subpart applies 
to contractors and offerors only. Individuals or firms who have other 
relationships with the NRC (e.g., parties to a licensing proceeding) are 
not covered by this regulation. This rule does not apply to the 
acquisition of consulting services through the personnel appointment 
process, NRC agreements with other government agencies, international 
organizations, or state, local, or foreign governments. Separate 
procedures for avoiding conflicts of interest will be employed in these 
agreements, as appropriate.


<R05>
2009.570-2  Definitions.

    As used in 2009.570:
    Affiliates means business concerns which are affiliates of each 
other when either directly or indirectly one concern or individual 
controls or has the power to control another, or when a third party 
controls or has the power to control both.
    Contract means any contractual agreement or other arrangement with 
the NRC except as provided in 2009.570-1(c).
    Contractor means any person, firm, unincorporated association, joint 
venture, co-sponsor, partnership, corporation, affiliates thereof, or 
their successors in interest, including their chief executives, 
directors, key personnel (identified in the contract), proposed 
consultants or subcontractors, which are a party to a contract with the 
NRC.
    Evaluation activities means any effort involving the appraisal of a 
technology, process, product, or policy.
    Offeror or prospective contractor means any person, firm, 
unincorporated association, joint venture, co-sponsor, partnership, 
corporation, or their affiliates or successors in interest, including 
their chief executives, directors, key personnel, proposed consultants, 
or subcontractors, submitting a bid or proposal, solicited or 
unsolicited, to the NRC to obtain a contract.
    Organizational conflicts of interest means that a relationship 
exists whereby a contractor or prospective contractor has present or 
planned interests related to the work to be performed under an NRC 
contract which:
    (1) May diminish its capacity to give impartial, technically sound, 
objective assistance and advice, or may otherwise result in a biased 
work product; or
    (2) May result in its being given an unfair competitive advantage.
    Potential conflict of interest means that a factual situation exists 
that suggests that an actual conflict of interest may arise from award 
of a proposed contract. The term potential conflict of interest is used 
to signify those situations that--
    (1) Merit investigation before contract award to ascertain whether 
award would give rise to an actual conflict; or
    (2) Must be reported to the contracting officer for investigation if 
they arise during contract performance.
    Research means any scientific or technical work involving 
theoretical analysis, exploration, or experimentation.
    Subcontractor means any subcontractor of any tier who performs work 
under a contract with the NRC except subcontracts for supplies and 
subcontracts in amounts not exceeding the small purchase threshold.
    Technical consulting and management support services means internal 
assistance to a component of the NRC in the formulation or 
administration of its programs, projects, or policies which normally 
require that the contractor be given access to proprietary information 
or to information that has not been made available to the public.

[[Page 476]]

These services typically include assistance in the preparation of 
program plans, preliminary designs, specifications, or statements of 
work.

<R05>
2009.570-3  Criteria for recognizing contractor organizational conflicts of interest.

    (a) General.
    (1) Two questions will be asked in determining whether actual or 
potential organizational conflicts of interest exist:
    (i) Are there conflicting roles which might bias an offeror's or 
contractor's judgment in relation to its work for the NRC?
    (ii) May the offeror or contractor be given an unfair competitive 
advantage based on the performance of the contract?
    (2) NRC's ultimate determination that organizational conflicts of 
interest exist will be made in light of common sense and good business 
judgment based upon the relevant facts. While it is difficult to 
identify and to prescribe in advance a specific method for avoiding all 
of the various situations or relationships that might involve potential 
organizational conflicts of interest, NRC personnel will pay particular 
attention to proposed contractual requirements that call for the 
rendering of advice, consultation or evaluation activities, or similar 
activities that directly lay the groundwork for the NRC's decisions on 
regulatory activities, future procurements, and research programs. Any 
work performed at an applicant or licensee site will also be closely 
scrutinized by the NRC staff.
    (b) Situations or relationships. The following situations or 
relationships may give rise to organizational conflicts of interest:
    (1) The offeror or contractor shall disclose information, that may 
give rise to organizational conflicts of interest under the following 
circumstances. The information may include the scope of work or 
specification for the requirement, being performed, the period of 
performance, and the name and telephone number for a point of contact at 
the organization knowledgeable about the commercial contract.
    (i) Where the offeror or contractor provides advice and 
recommendation to the NRC in the same technical area where it is also 
providing consulting assistance to any organization regulated by the 
NRC.
    (ii) Where the offeror or contractor provides advice to the NRC on 
the same or similar matter on which it is also providing assistance to 
any organization regulated by the NRC.
    (iii) Where the offeror or contractor evaluates its own products or 
services, or has been substantially involved in the development or 
marketing of the products or services of another entity.
    (iv) Where the award of a contract would result in placing the 
offeror or contractor in a conflicting role in which its judgment may be 
biased in relation to its work for the NRC, or would result in an unfair 
competitive advantage for the offeror or contractor.
    (v) Where the offeror or contractor solicits or performs work at an 
applicant or licensee site while performing work in the same technical 
area for the NRC at the same site.
    (2) The contracting officer may request specific information from an 
offeror or contractor or may require special contract clauses such as 
provided in 2009.570-5(b) in the following circumstances:
    (i) Where the offeror or contractor prepares specifications that are 
to be used in competitive procurements of products or services covered 
by the specifications.
    (ii) Where the offeror or contractor prepares plans for specific 
approaches or methodologies that are to be incorporated into competitive 
procurements using the approaches or methodologies.
    (iii) Where the offeror or contractor is granted access to 
information not available to the public concerning NRC plans, policies, 
or programs that could form the basis for a later procurement action.
    (iv) Where the offeror or contractor is granted access to 
proprietary information of its competitors.
    (v) Where the award of a contract might result in placing the 
offeror or contractor in a conflicting role in which its judgment may be 
biased in

[[Page 477]]

relation to its work for the NRC or might result in an unfair 
competitive advantage for the offeror or contractor.
    (c) Policy application guidance. The following examples are 
illustrative only and are not intended to identify and resolve all 
contractor organizational conflict of interest situations.
    (1)(i) Example. The ABC Corp., in response to a Request for Proposal 
(RFP), proposes to undertake certain analyses of a reactor component as 
called for in the RFP. The ABC Corp. is one of several companies 
considered to be technically well qualified. In response to the inquiry 
in the RFP, the ABC Corp. advises that it is currently performing 
similar analyses for the reactor manufacturer.
    (ii) Guidance. An NRC contract for that particular work normally 
would not be awarded to the ABC Corp. because the company would be 
placed in a position in which its judgment could be biased in 
relationship to its work for the NRC. Because there are other well-
qualified companies available, there would be no reason for considering 
a waiver of the policy.
    (2)(i) Example. The ABC Corp., in response to an RFP, proposes to 
perform certain analyses of a reactor component that is unique to one 
type of advanced reactor. As is the case with other technically 
qualified companies responding to the RFP, the ABC Corp. is performing 
various projects for several different utility clients. None of the ABC 
Corp. projects have any relationship to the work called for in the RFP. 
Based on the NRC evaluation, the ABC Corp. is considered to be the best 
qualified company to perform the work outlined in the RFP.
    (ii) Guidance. An NRC contract normally could be awarded to the ABC 
Corp. because no conflict of interest exists which could motivate bias 
with respect to the work. An appropriate clause would be included in the 
contract to preclude the ABC Corp. from subsequently contracting for 
work with the private sector that could create a conflict during the 
performance of the NRC contract. For example, ABC Corp. would be 
precluded from the performance of similar work for the company 
developing the advanced reactor mentioned in the example.
    (3)(i) Example. The ABC Corp., in response to a competitive RFP, 
submits a proposal to assist the NRC in revising NRC's guidance 
documents on the respiratory protection requirements of 10 CFR part 20. 
ABC Corp. is the only firm determined to be technically acceptable. ABC 
Corp. has performed substantial work for regulated utilities in the past 
and is expected to continue similar efforts in the future. The work has 
and will cover the writing, implementation, and administration of 
compliance respiratory protection programs for nuclear power plants.
    (ii) Guidance. This situation would place the firm in a role where 
its judgment could be biased in relationship to its work for the NRC. 
Because the nature of the required work is vitally important in terms of 
the NRC's responsibilities and no reasonable alternative exists, a 
waiver of the policy, in accordance with 2009.570-9 may be warranted. 
Any waiver must be fully documented in accordance with the waiver 
provisions of this policy with particular attention to the establishment 
of protective mechanisms to guard against bias.
    (4)(i) Example. The ABC Corp. submits a proposal for a new system to 
evaluate a specific reactor component's performance for the purpose of 
developing standards that are important to the NRC program. The ABC 
Corp. has advised the NRC that it intends to sell the new system to 
industry once its practicability has been demonstrated. Other companies 
in this business are using older systems for evaluation of the specific 
reactor component.
    (ii) Guidance. A contract could be awarded to the ABC Corp. if the 
contract stipulates that no information produced under the contract will 
be used in the contractor's private activities unless this information 
has been reported to the NRC. Data on how the reactor component 
performs, which is reported to the NRC by contractors, will normally be 
disseminated by the NRC to others to preclude an unfair competitive 
advantage. When the NRC furnishes information about the reactor 
component to the contractor for the performance of contracted work, the 
information may not be used in the contractor's private activities 
unless

[[Page 478]]

the information is generally available to others. Further, the contract 
will stipulate that the contractor will inform the NRC contracting 
officer of all situations in which the information, developed about the 
performance of the reactor component under the contract, is proposed to 
be used.
    (5)(i) Example. The ABC Corp., in response to a RFP, proposes to 
assemble a map showing certain seismological features of the Appalachian 
fold belt. In accordance with the representation in the RFP and 
2009.570-3(b)(1)(i), ABC Corp. informs the NRC that it is presently 
doing seismological studies for several utilities in the eastern United 
States, but none of the sites are within the geographic area 
contemplated by the NRC study.
    (ii) Guidance. The contracting officer would normally conclude that 
award of a contract would not place ABC Corp. in a conflicting role 
where its judgment might be biased. Section 2052.209-73(c) Work for 
Others, would preclude ABC Corp. from accepting work which could create 
a conflict of interest during the term of the NRC contract.
    (6)(i) Example. AD Division of ABC Corp., in response to a RFP, 
submits a proposal to assist the NRC in the safety an environmental 
review of applications for licenses for the construction, operation, and 
decommissioning of fuel cycle facilities. ABC Corp. is divided into two 
separate and distinct divisions, AD and BC. The BC Division performs the 
same or similar services for industry. The BC Division is currently 
providing the same or similar services required under the NRC's contract 
for an applicant or licensee.
    (ii) Guidance. An NRC contract for that particular work would not be 
awarded to the ABC Corp. The AD Division could be placed in a position 
to pass judgment on work performed by the BC Division, which could bias 
its work for NRC. Further, the Conflict of Interest provisions apply to 
ABC Corp. and not to separate or distinct divisions within the company. 
If no reasonable alternative exists, a waiver of the policy could be 
sought in accordance with 2009.570-9.
    (7)(i) Example. The ABC Corp. completes an analysis for NRC of steam 
generator tube leaks at one of a utility's six sites. Three months 
later, ABC Corp. is asked by this utility to perform the same analysis 
at another of its sites.
    (ii) Guidance. 2052.290-73(c)(3) would prohibit the contractor from 
beginning this work for the utility until one year after completion of 
the NRC work at the first site.
    (8)(i) Example. ABC Corp. is assisting NRC in a major on-site 
analysis of a utility's redesign of the common areas between its twin 
reactors. The contract is for two years with an estimated value of $5 
million. Near the completion of the NRC work, ABC Corp. requests 
authority to solicit for a $100K contract with the same utility to 
transport spent fuel to a disposal site. ABC Corp. is performing no 
other work for the utility.
    (ii) Guidance. The Contracting Officer, would allow the contractor 
to proceed with the solicitation because (A) it is not in the same 
technical area as the NRC work and (B) the potential for technical bias 
by the contractor because of financial ties to the utility is slight due 
to the relative value of the two contracts.
    (9)(i) Example. The ABC Corp. is constructing a turbine building and 
installing new turbines at a reactor site. The contract with the utility 
is for five years and has a total value of $100 million. ABC Corp. has 
responded to an NRC Request for Proposal requiring the contractor to 
participate in a major team inspection unrelated to the turbine work at 
the same site. The estimated value of the contract is $75K.
    (ii) Guidance. An NRC contract would not normally be awarded to ABC 
Corp. since these factors create the potential for financial loyalty to 
the utility that may bias the technical judgment of the contractor.
    (d) Other considerations.
    (1) The fact that the NRC can identify and later avoid, eliminate, 
or neutralize any potential organizational conflicts arising from the 
performance of a contract is not relevant to a determination of the 
existence of conflicts prior to the award of a contract.
    (2) It is not relevant that the contractor has the professional 
reputation of being able to resist temptations

[[Page 479]]

which arise from organizational conflicts of interest, or that a follow-
on procurement is not involved, or that a contract is awarded on a 
competitive or a sole source basis.


<R05>
2009.570-4  Representation.

    (a) The following procedures are designed to assist the NRC 
contracting officer in determining whether situations or relationships 
exist which may constitute organizational conflicts of interest with 
respect to a particular offeror or contractor. The procedures apply to 
small purchases meeting the criteria stated in the following paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (b) The organizational conflict of interest representation provision 
at 2052.209-72 must be included in solicitations and unsolicited 
proposals, (including those for task orders and modifications for new 
work) for:
    (1) Evaluation services or activities;
    (2) Technical consulting and management support services;
    (3) Research; and
    (4) Other contractual situations where special organizational 
conflicts of interest provisions are noted in the solicitation and would 
be included in the resulting contract. This representation requirement 
also applies to all modifications for additional effort under the 
contract except those issued under the ``Changes'' clause. Where, 
however, a statement of the type required by the organizational 
conflicts of interest representation provisions has previously been 
submitted with regard to the contract being modified, only an updating 
of the statement is required.
    (c) The offeror may, because of actual or potential organizational 
conflicts of interest, propose to exclude specific kinds of work 
contained in a RFP unless the RFP specifically prohibits the exclusion. 
Any such proposed exclusion by an offeror will be considered by the NRC 
in the evaluation of proposals. If the NRC considers the proposed 
excluded work to be an essential or integral part of the required work 
and its exclusion would be to the detriment of the competitive posture 
of the other offerors, the NRC shall reject the proposal as 
unacceptable.
    (d) The offeror's failure to execute the representation required by 
paragraph (b) of this section with respect to an invitation for bids is 
considered to be a minor informality. The offeror will be permitted to 
correct the omission.


<R05>
2009.570-5  Contract clauses.

    (a) General contract clause. All contracts and small purchases of 
the types set forth in 2009.570-4(b) must include the clause entitled, 
``Contractor Organizational Conflicts of Interest,'' set forth in 
2052.209-73.
    (b) Other special contract clauses. If it is determined from the 
nature of the proposed contract that an organizational conflict of 
interest exists, the contracting officer may determine that the conflict 
can be avoided, or, after obtaining a waiver in accordance with 
2009.570-9, neutralized through the use of an appropriate special 
contract clause. If appropriate, the offeror may negotiate the terms and 
conditions of these clauses, including the extent and time period of any 
restriction. These clauses include but are not limited to:
    (1) Hardware exclusion clauses which prohibit the acceptance of 
production contracts following a related non-production contract 
previously performed by the contractor;
    (2) Software exclusion clauses;
    (3) Clauses which require the contractor (and certain of its key 
personnel) to avoid certain organizational conflicts of interest; and
    (4) Clauses which provide for protection of confidential data and 
guard against its unauthorized use.


<R05>
2009.570-6  Evaluation, findings, and contract award.

    The contracting officer shall evaluate all relevant facts submitted 
by an offeror and other relevant information. After evaluating this 
information against the criteria of 2009.570-3, the contracting officer 
shall make a findings of whether organizational conflicts of interest 
exist with respect to a particular offeror. If it has been determined 
that real or potential conflicts of interest exist, the contracting 
officer shall:
    (a) Disqualify the offeror from award;

[[Page 480]]

    (b) Avoid or eliminate such conflicts by appropriate measures; or
    (c) Award the contract under the waiver provision of 2009.570-9.


<R05>
2009.570-7  Conflicts identified after award.

    If potential organizational conflicts of interest are identified 
after award with respect to a particular contractor, and the contracting 
officer determines that conflicts do exist and that it would not be in 
the best interest of the government to terminate the contract, as 
provided in the clauses required by 2009.570-5, the contracting officer 
shall take every reasonable action to avoid, eliminate, or, after 
obtaining a waiver in accordance with 2009.570-9, neutralize the effects 
of the identified conflict.


<R05>
2009.570-8  Subcontracts.

    The contracting officer shall require offerors and contractors to 
submit a representative statement from all subcontractors (other than a 
supply subcontractor) and consultants performing services in excess of 
$10,000 in accordance with 2009.570-4(b). The contracting officer shall 
require the contractor to include contract clauses in accordance with 
2009.570-5 in consultant agreements or subcontracts involving 
performance of work under a prime contract.


<R05>
2009.570-9  Waiver.

    (a) The contracting officer determines the need to seek a waiver for 
specific contract awards, with the advice and concurrence of the program 
office director and legal counsel. Upon the recommendation of the 
Procurement Executive, and after consultation with legal counsel, the 
Executive Director for Operations may waive the policy in specific cases 
if he determines that it is in the best interest of the United States to 
do so.
    (b) Waiver action is strictly limited to those situations in which:
    (1) The work to be performed under contract is vital to the NRC 
program.
    (2) The work cannot be satisfactorily performed except by a 
contractor whose interests give rise to question of conflict of 
interest.
    (3) Contractual and/or technical review and surveillance methods can 
be employed by the NRC to neutralize the conflict.
    (c) For any waivers, the justification and approval documents must 
be placed in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower 
Level), Washington, DC.


<R05>
2009.570-10  Remedies.

    In addition to other remedies permitted by law or contract for a 
breach of the restrictions in this subpart or for any intentional 
misrepresentation or intentional nondisclosure of any relevant interest 
required to be provided for this section, the NRC may debar the 
contractor from subsequent NRC contracts.

2010.004  Brand name products or equal.
2010.011  Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.

    Authority: Sec. 161, 68 Stat. 948, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2201); Sec. 
201, 88 Stat. 1242, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5841; 41 U.S.C. 418(b).


<R05>
2010.004  Brand name products or equal.

    (a) Acquisitions will generally not be based on a specifically 
identified product or feature(s) thereof. However, under unusual 
circumstances this type of approach may be used as described below.
    (b) Brand name or equal purchase descriptions must cite all brand 
name products known to be acceptable and of current manufacture. If the 
use of a brand name or equal purchase description results in the 
purchase of an acceptable brand name product which was not listed as an 
``equal'' product, a reference to that brand name product should be 
included in the purchase description for later acquisition. If a brand 
name product is no longer applicable, the reference to that brand name 
must be deleted from any subsequent purchase description.
    (1) It is imperative that brand name or equal purchase descriptions 
specify each physical or functional characteristic of the product that 
is essential to the intended use. Failure to do

[[Page 481]]

so may result in a defective solicitation and the necessity to resolicit 
the requirement. Care must be taken to avoid specifying characteristics 
that cannot be shown to materially affect the intended end use and which 
unnecessarily restrict competition.
    (2) When describing essential characteristics, permissible 
tolerances should be indicated. A characteristic (e.g., a specific 
dimension) of a brand name product may not be specified unless it is 
essential to the Government's need. The contracting officer shall be 
able to justify the requirement.
    (c) The clause found at 2052.210-70 must be inserted in all 
solicitations citing a brand name or equal, except when samples are 
requested.
    (d) An offer may not be rejected for failure of the offered product 
to equal a characteristic of a brand name product if it was not 
specified in the brand name or equal description. However, if it is 
clearly established that the unspecified characteristic is essential to 
the intended end use, the solicitation is defective and no award may be 
made. In these cases, the contracting officer should resolicit the 
requirements, using a purchase description that sets forth the essential 
characteristics.
    (e) In small purchases within the open market limitations, brand 
name policies and procedures are applicable to the extent practicable.

Drawings, Designs, Specifications, and Data, in all contracts in which 
drawings, designs, specifications, or other data will be developed and 
the NRC must retain full rights to them (except for the contractor's 
right to retain a copy for its own use). When any of the clauses 
prescribed at FAR 27.409, Solicitation Provisions and Contract Clauses, 
are included in the solicitation/contract, this clause will not be used.

    (d) The contracting officer may alter these clauses prior to 
issuance of the solicitation or during competition by solicitation 
amendment. Reporting requirements should be set at a meaningful and 
productive frequency. Insignificant changes may also be made by the 
contracting officer on a case-by-case basis during negotiations, without 
solicitation amendment.

Business Administration under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act.


<R05>
2015.604  Responsibilities.

    (a) All persons participating in the evaluation process may not 
discuss or reveal information concerning the evaluations except to an 
individual participating in the same evaluation proceeding, and then 
only to the extent that the information is required in connection with 
the proceeding. Divulging information during evaluation, selection, and 
negotiation phases of the acquisition to offerors or to other persons 
not having a need to know could jeopardize the resultant award and 
violates the information-disclosure provisions of FAR 3.104, Procurement 
Integrity. These provisions carry criminal as well as civil and 
administrative penalties. Only the contracting officer (or authorized 
representative within the Division of Contracts and Property Management) 
may release source selection information to others during the selection 
process. The contracting officer (or authorized representative) shall 
instruct all participants in the evaluations to observe the prohibitions 
of the Procurement Integrity Act. A procurement official certification 
must be signed for each agency employee personally and substantially 
involved in preparing or approving the advance procurement plans, 
statement of work and participating in the source evaluation process 
[i.e. serving as a member of the Source Evaluation Panel (SEP)].
    (b) All persons participating in the evaluation process shall 
declare any financial or other relationships which may create conflict 
of interest problems with their evaluation duties. A form for this 
purpose must be signed prior to receipt of any proposals or 
participation in discussion of proposals.
    (c) Only the contracting officer (or authorized representative 
within the Division of Contracts and Property Management) may conduct 
discussions with offerors relative to any aspect of the acquisition. The 
contracting officer may include other personnel in discussions, as 
necessary.

<R05>
2015.605  Evaluation factors.

    The evaluation criteria included in the solicitation serve as the 
standard against which all proposals are evaluated, and are the basis 
for the development of proposal preparation instructions, in accordance 
with 2015.407-70(b). Indication in the solicitation of the relative 
importance of evaluation factors and subfactors is accomplished by

[[Page 485]]

the assignment of a numerical weight to each. For those factors that 
will not be numerically weighted, only their relative importance will be 
stated in the solicitation. Examples of factors which may not be 
numerically weighted are conflict of interest, estimated cost, and 
business evaluations, and ``go/no go'' evaluation factors.
[57 FR 61166, Dec. 23, 1992; 58 FR 8450, Feb. 12, 1993]


<R05>
2015.607  Disclosure of mistakes before award.

    (a) The contracting officer shall require that the offeror's 
clarification(s) provided in accordance with FAR 15.607 be in writing.
    (b) A correction of a mistake in a proposal may be made only after a 
written determination to permit it has been made by the contracting 
officer.


<R05>
2015.608  Proposal evaluation.

    (a) A Source Evaluation Panel (SEP) shall evaluate technical 
proposals in accordance with the solicitation technical evaluation 
criteria. The SEP prepares and signs the Competitive Range Report with 
the SEP's findings and scoring for each technical proposal together with 
its analysis of cost and other factors and forwards the report for the 
review and approval of the Designating Official. The contracting officer 
uses this technical evaluation and analysis of costs and other factors 
in determining the competitive range.
    (b) The Designating Official (Office Director or designee) is 
responsible for appointing the SEP and is responsible for conducting an 
independent review and evaluation of the SEP's two primary products 
after proposal evaluation: the Competitive Range Report and the Final 
Evaluation Report. Any cancellation of solicitations and subsequent 
rejection of all proposals must be approved by the Head of the 
Contracting Activity.


<R05>
2015.610  Written or oral discussions.

    The contracting officer shall point out to each offeror within the 
competitive range any deficiencies including ambiguities or 
uncertainties in its proposal. The discussions are intended to assist 
the SEP in understanding the proposals and their strengths and 
weaknesses based upon the individual efforts of each offeror to ensure 
that the meaning and emphasis of solicitation provisions have been 
adequately conveyed to the offerors so that all offerors are competing 
equally on the basis intended by the Government.


<R05>
2015.611  Best and final offers.

    The SEP evaluates the technical proposal portion of the best and 
final offers. Technical proposals will be recorded and rescored by the 
SEP, as appropriate, and a Final Evaluation Report of the SEP's findings 
and scoring for each technical proposal will be prepared and forwarded 
to the Designating Official for review and approval prior to submission 
to the contracting officer for final approval. The report will include a 
summary of the technical analysis of costs as a part of the analysis of 
the technical proposals. The SEP's individual evaluation worksheets and 
summary score sheet must accompany the Final Evaluation Report and will 
become part of the official file.
[57 FR 61166, Dec. 23, 1992; 58 FR 8450, Feb. 12, 1993]


<R05>
2015.612  Source Evaluation Panel structure.

    (a) For all proposed contracts with total estimated values in excess 
of $25,000 and expected to result from competitive technical and price/
cost negotiations, the cooperative review efforts of technical, 
contracting, and other administrative personnel are formalized through 
the establishment of a SEP.
    (b)(1) The SEP includes:
    (i) At least three technical members (one of whom serves as the 
chairperson) who participate in the scoring of proposals using weighted 
evaluation criteria and evaluating proposals using other unweighted 
factors; and
    (ii) A contract negotiator who ensures that procurement rules and 
regulations are followed, ensures that the integrity of the process is 
maintained, and negotiates the contract on behalf of the NRC.
    (2) Except in unusual cases, the SEP should not exceed five members 
including the Chairperson. The technical members are usually employees 
of the

[[Page 486]]

NRC program office initiating the request or other NRC employees with 
expertise in areas related to the solicitation Statement of Work. 
Appointment of a technical member from other than the office initiating 
the request is encouraged. Employees of other agencies with expertise in 
a specific area may also serve as SEP technical members not withstanding 
the fact that they are not employees of the NRC. Evaluators need not be 
Federal employees, but the potential for conflict of interest must be 
carefully considered in these cases and the solicitation should notify 
offerors of the NRC's intent to use non-Federal evaluators. The CO will 
make a determination whether or not a non-federal evaluator will be a 
voting SEP member. For proposed procurements with a total estimated cost 
of less than $500,000 over a performance period of three years or less, 
a single technical member may be appointed to evaluate proposals with 
the contracting officer's approval. Designation of SEP members is 
accomplished by memorandum initiated by the director of the program 
office or the director's designee. This official is referred to as the 
Designating Official (DO).
    (c) The SEP chairperson may obtain the services of advisors (e.g., 
legal, financial, etc.) to assist the SEP. Advisors who serve on 
technical evaluation committees are appointed in writing by the DO. 
Advisors are not SEP members, and therefore do not score proposals. 
Advisors need not be Federal employees, but the potential for conflict 
of interest must be carefully considered in these cases, and the 
solicitation should notify offerors of the NRC's intent to use non-
Federal advisors.
    (d) The contracting officer shall establish the competitive range on 
all acquisitions. This is accomplished by approval of the SEP's written 
recommendation transmitted by the DO.
    (e) The source selection official is the contracting officer. 
Selection is made based on review of the SEP's recommendations as 
endorsed by the DO, together with all supporting data to ensure that 
award is in accordance with sound procurement principles and directly 
related to the evaluation criteria as set forth in the solicitation. Any 
proposed selection not endorsed by the DO will be concurred in by the 
Head of the Contracting Activity.


<R05>
2015.670  Contract provisions.

    (a) The contracting officer shall include the provision found at 
2052.215-84, Contract Award and Evaluation of Proposals, in all 
solicitations where technical is more important than cost:
    (1) The contracting officer shall substitute the paragraph found at 
2052.215-85 for paragraph (b) in all solicitations for negotiated 
competitive procurements where cost is more important than technical 
merit.
    (2) The contracting officer shall substitute the paragraph found at 
2052.215-86 for paragraph (b) in all solicitations for negotiated 
competitive procurements where cost and technical merit are of equal 
significance.
    (b) The contracting officer may make appropriate changes to the 
provision to accurately reflect other evaluation procedures, such as 
evaluation of proposals against mandatory criteria and benchmarking 
criteria for ADP procurements.

    (a) Vouchers and invoices submitted to NRC must be submitted to the 
contracting officer or designee for review and approval for payment. If 
the examination of a voucher or invoice raises a question regarding the 
allowability of a cost submitted, the contracting officer or designee 
shall:
    (1) Hold informal discussions with the contractor as appropriate.
    (2) If the discussions do not resolve the matter, the contracting 
officer shall issue a notice advising the contractor of costs 
disallowed. The notice must advise the contractor that it may:
    (i) If in disagreement with the disallowance, submit a written claim 
to the contracting officer for payment of the disallowed cost and 
explain why the cost should be reimbursed; or
    (ii) If the disagreement(s) cannot be settled, file a claim under 
the disputes clause which will be processed in accordance with disputes 
procedures found at FAR subpart 33.2; and
    (3) Process the voucher or invoice for payment and advise the NRC 
Division of Accounting and Finance to deduct the disallowed costs when 
scheduling the voucher for payment.
    (b) When audit reports or other notifications question costs or 
consider them unallowable, the contracting officer shall resolve all 
cost issues through discussions with the contractor and/or auditor, 
whenever possible, within six months of receipt of the audit report.
    (1) One of the following courses of action must be pursued:
    (i) Accept and implement audit recommendations as submitted;
    (ii) Accept the principle of the audit recommendation but adjust the 
amount of the questioned costs;
    (iii) Reject audit findings and recommendations.
    (2) When implementing the chosen course of action, the contracting 
officer shall:
    (i) Hold discussions with the auditor and contractor, as 
appropriate;
    (ii) If the contracting officer agrees with the auditor concerning 
the questioned costs, attempt to negotiate a mutual settlement of 
questioned costs;
    (iii) Issue a final decision, including any disallowance of 
questioned costs; inform the contractor of his/her right to appeal the 
decision under the disputes procedures found at FAR subpart 33.2; and 
provide a copy of the final decision of the Office of the Inspector 
General; and
    (iv) Initiate immediate recoupment actions for all disallowed costs 
owed the government by one or more of the following methods:
    (A) Request that the contractor provide a credit adjustment (offset) 
against amounts billed the government on the next or other future 
invoice(s) submitted under the contract for which the disallowed costs 
apply;
    (B) Deduct the disallowed costs from the next invoice submitted 
under the contract;
    (C) Deduct the disallowed costs on a schedule determined by the 
contracting officer after discussion with the contractor (if the 
contracting officer determines that an immediate and complete deduction 
is inappropriate); and
    (D) Advise the contractor that a refund is immediately payable to 
the government (in situations where there are insufficient payments owed 
by the government to effect recovery from the contract).

    (a) Unless otherwise provided for in FAR 45.302-1(d), applicable to 
Government facilities with a unit cost of less than $10,000, a 
contractor may be provided Government property or allowed to purchase 
the property at Government expense upon determination made by the 
contracting officer with the advice of the agency property official 
that:
    (1) No practicable or economical alternative exists; e.g., 
acquisition from other sources, utilization of subcontractors, rental of 
property, or modification of program project requirements;
    (2) Furnishing Government property is likely to result in 
substantially lower costs to the Government for the items produced or 
services rendered when all costs involved (e.g., transportation, 
installation, modification, maintenance, etc.) are compared with the 
costs to the Government of the contractor's use of privately-owned 
property; and
    (3) The Government receives adequate consideration for providing the 
property.
    (b) If the program office is aware before the submission of the RFPA 
that it will be necessary to provide prospective contractors with 
Government property, a written justification must accompany the RFPA to 
the Division of Contracts and Property Management.

             Subpart 2052.2--Text of Provisions and Clauses


<R05>
2052.200  Authority.


<R05>
2052.204-70  Security.

    As prescribed at 2004.404(a), insert the following clause in 
applicable solicitations and contracts:

                                Security

    (a) Security/Classification Requirements Form. The attached NRC Form 
187 (See Section J for List of Attachments) furnishes the basis for 
providing security and classification requirements to prime contractors, 
subcontractors, or others (e.g., bidders) who have or may have an NRC 
contractual relationship that requires access to classified information 
or matter, access on a continuing basis (in excess of 90 or more days) 
to NRC Headquarters controlled buildings, or otherwise requires NRC 
photo identification or card-key badges.
    (b) It is the contractor's duty to safeguard National Security 
Information, Restricted Data, and Formerly Restricted Data. The 
contractor shall, in accordance with the Commission's security 
regulations and requirements, be responsible for safeguarding National 
Security Information, Restricted Data, and Formerly Restricted Data, and 
for protecting against sabotage, espionage, loss, and theft, the 
classified documents and material in the contractor's possession in 
connection with the performance of work under this contract. Except as 
otherwise expressly

[[Page 496]]

provided in this contract, the contractor shall, upon completion or 
termination of this contract, transmit to the Commission any classified 
matter in the possession of the contractor or any person under the 
contractor's control in connection with performance of this contract. If 
retention by the contractor of any classified matter is required after 
the completion or termination of the contract and the retention is 
approved by the contracting officer, the contractor shall complete a 
certificate of possession to be furnished to the Commission specifying 
the classified matter to be retained. The certification must identify 
the items and types or categories of matter retained, the conditions 
governing the retention of the matter and their period of retention, if 
known. If the retention is approved by the contracting officer, the 
security provisions of the contract continue to be applicable to the 
matter retained.
    (c) In connection with the performance of the work under this 
contract, the contractor may be furnished, or may develop or acquire, 
proprietary data (trade secrets) or confidential or privileged 
technical, business, or financial information, including Commission 
plans, policies, reports, financial plans, internal data protected by 
the Privacy Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-579), or other information which has 
not been released to the public or has been determined by the Commission 
to be otherwise exempt from disclosure to the public. The contractor 
agrees to hold the information in confidence and not to directly or 
indirectly duplicate, disseminate, or disclose the information in whole 
or in part to any other person or organization except as may be 
necessary to perform the work under this contract. The contractor agrees 
to return the information to the Commission or otherwise dispose of it 
at the direction of the contracting officer. Failure to comply with this 
clause is grounds for termination of this contract.
    (d) Regulations. The contractor agrees to conform to all security 
regulations and requirements of the Commission which are subject to 
change as directed by the NRC Division of Security and the Contracting 
Officer. These changes will be under the authority of the changes 
clause.
    (e) Definition of National Security Information. The term National 
Security Information, as used in this clause, means information that has 
been determined pursuant to Executive Order 12356 or any predecessor 
order to require protection against unauthorized disclosure and that is 
so designated.
    (f) Definition of Restricted Data. The term Restricted Data, as used 
in this clause, means all data concerning:
    (1) design, manufacture, or utilization of atomic weapons;
    (2) the production of special nuclear material; or
    (3) the use of special nuclear material in the production of energy, 
but does not include data declassified or removed from the Restricted 
Data category pursuant to section 142 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 
as amended.
    (g) Definition of Formerly Restricted Data. The term Formerly 
Restricted Data, as used in this clause, means all data removed from the 
Restricted Data category under section 142-d of the Atomic Energy Act of 
1954, as amended.
    (h) Security clearance personnel. The contractor may not permit any 
individual to have access to Restricted Data, Formerly Restricted Data, 
or other classified information, except in accordance with the Atomic 
Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations or 
requirements applicable to the particular type or category of classified 
information to which access is required. The contractor shall also 
execute a Standard Form 312, Classified Information Nondisclosure 
Agreement, when access to classified information is required.
    (i) Criminal liabilities. It is understood that disclosure of 
National Security Information, Restricted Data, and Formerly Restricted 
Data, relating to the work or services ordered hereunder to any person 
not entitled to receive it, or failure to safeguard any Restricted Data, 
Formerly Restricted Data, or any other classified matter that may come 
to the contractor or any person under the contractor's control in 
connection with work under this contract, may subject the contractor, 
its agents, employees, or subcontractors to criminal liability under the 
laws of the United States. (See the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended, 42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.; 18 U.S.C. 793 and 794; and Executive 
Order 12356.)
    (j) Subcontracts and purchase orders. Except as otherwise authorized 
in writing by the contracting officer, the contractor shall insert 
provisions similar to the foregoing in all subcontracts and purchase 
orders under this contract.
    (k) In performing the contract work, the contractor shall classify 
all documents, material, and equipment originated or generated by the 
contractor in accordance with guidance issued by the Commission. Every 
subcontract and purchase order issued hereunder involving the 
origination or generation of classified documents, material, and 
equipment must provide that the subcontractor or supplier assign 
classification to all documents, material, and equipment in accordance 
with guidance furnished by the contractor.

<R05>
2052.204-71  Site access badge requirements.

    As prescribed at 2004.404(b), insert the following clause in 
applicable solicitations and contracts:

                      Site Access Badge Requirement

    During the life of this contract, the rights of ingress and egress 
for contractor personnel must be made available as required. In this 
regard, all contractor personnel whose duties under this contract 
require their presence on-site shall be clearly identifiable by a 
distinctive badge furnished by the Government. The Project Officer shall 
assist the contractor in obtaining the badges for the contractor 
personnel. It is the sole responsibility of the contractor to ensure 
that each employee has proper identification at all times. All 
prescribed identification must be immediately delivered to the Security 
Office for cancellation or disposition upon the termination of 
employment of any contractor personnel. Contractor personnel must have 
this identification in their possession during on-site performance under 
this contract. It is the contractor's duty to assure that contractor 
personnel enter only those work areas necessary for performance of 
contract work, and to assure the safeguarding of any Government records 
or data that contractor personnel may come into contact with.

                             (End of Clause)


<R05>
2052.209-70  Qualifications of contract employees.

    As prescribed at 2009.105-70, insert the following provision in 
applicable solicitations:

                  Qualifications of Contract Employees

    The offeror hereby certifies by submission of this offer that all 
representations made regarding its employees, proposed subcontractor 
personnel, and consultants are accurate.

                           (End of Provision)


<R05>
2052.209-71  Current/former agency employee involvement.

    As prescribed at 2009.105-70, insert the following provision in 
applicable solicitations:

               Current/Former Agency Employee Involvement

    (a) The following representation is required by the NRC Acquisition 
Regulation 2009.105-70(b). It is not NRC policy to encourage offerors 
and contractors to propose current/former agency employees to perform 
work under NRC contracts, and as set forth in the above cited provision, 
the use of such employees may, under certain conditions, adversely 
affect NRC's consideration of non-competitive proposals and task orders.
    (b) The offeror hereby certifies that there (  ) are (  ) are no 
current/former NRC employees (including special Government employees 
performing services as experts, advisors, consultants, or members of 
advisory committees) who have been or will be involved, directly or 
indirectly, in developing the offer, or in negotiating on behalf of the 
offeror, or in managing, administering, or performing any contract, 
consultant agreement, or subcontract resulting from this offer. For each 
individual so identified, the Technical and Management proposal must 
contain, as a separate attachment, the name of the individual, the 
individual's title while employed by the NRC, the date individual left 
NRC, and brief description of the individual's role under this proposal.

                           (End of Provision)


<R05>
2052.209-72  Contractor organizational conflicts of interest (representation).

    As prescribed at 2009.570-4(b) and 2009.570-8, insert the following 
provision in applicable solicitations:

     Contractor Organizational Conflicts of Interest Representation

    I represent to the best of my knowledge and belief that:
    The award to ____________________ of a contract or the modification 
of an existing contract does /  / does not /  / involve situations or 
relationships of the type set forth in 48 CFR 2009.570-3(b).
    (a) If the representation, as completed, indicates that situations 
or relationships of the type set forth in 48 CFR 2009.570-3(b) are 
involved, or the contracting officer otherwise determines that potential 
organizational conflicts of interest exist, the offeror shall provide a 
statement in writing which describes in a concise manner all relevant 
factors bearing on his representation to the contracting officer. If the 
contracting officer determines that organizational conflicts exist, the 
following actions may be taken:
    (1) Impose appropriate conditions which avoid such conflicts,
    (2) Disqualify the offeror, or
    (3) Determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the 
United States to seek award of the contract under the waiver provisions 
of 48 CFR 2009-570-9.
    (b) The refusal to provide the representation required by 48 CFR 
2009.570-4(b), or upon request of the contracting officer, the facts 
required by 48 CFR 2009.570-3(b), must result in disqualification of the 
offeror for award.

                           (End of Provision)


<R05>
2052.209-73  Contractor organizational conflicts of interest.

    As prescribed at 2009.570-5(a) and 2009-570-8, insert the following 
clause in all applicable solicitations and contracts:

             Contractor Organizational Conflicts of Interest

    (a) Purpose. The primary purpose of this clause is to aid in 
ensuring that the contractor:
    (1) Is not placed in a conflicting role because of current or 
planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) 
which relate to the work under this contract; and
    (2) Does not obtain an unfair competitive advantage over other 
parties by virtue of its performance of this contract.
    (b) Scope. The restrictions described apply to performance or 
participation by the contractor, as defined in 48 CFR 2009.570-2 in the 
activities covered by this clause.
    (c) Work for others.
    (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this contract, during the 
term of this contract the contractor agrees to forgo entering into 
consulting or other contractual arrangements with any firm or 
organization, the result of which may give rise to a conflict of 
interest with respect to the work being performed under this contract. 
The contractor shall ensure that all employees under this contract abide 
by the provision of this clause. If the contractor has reason to believe 
with respect to itself or any employee that any proposed consultant or 
other contractual arrangement with any firm or organization may involve 
a potential conflict of interest, the contractor shall obtain the 
written approval of the contracting officer before the execution of such 
contractual arrangement.
    (2) The contractor may not represent, assist, or otherwise support 
an NRC licensee or applicant undergoing an NRC audit, inspection, or 
review where the activities that are the subject of the audit, 
inspection or review are the same as or substantially similar to the 
services within the scope of this contract (or task order as 
appropriate), except where the NRC licensee or applicant requires the 
contractor's support to explain or defend the contractor's prior work 
for the utility or other entity which NRC questions.
    (3) When the contractor performs work for the NRC under this 
contract at any NRC licensee or applicant site, the contractor shall 
neither solicit nor perform work in the same or similar technical area 
for that licensee or applicant organization for a period commencing with 
the award of the task order or beginning of work on the site (if not a 
task order contract) and ending one year after completion of all work 
under the associated task order, or last time at the site (if not a task 
order contract).
    (4) When the contractor performs work for the NRC under this 
contract at any NRC licensee or applicant site,
    (i) The contractor may not solicit work at that site for that 
licensee or applicant during the period of performance of the task order 
or the contract, as appropriate.
    (ii) The contractor may not perform work at that site for that 
licensee or applicant during the period of performance of the task order 
or the contract, as appropriate, and for one year thereafter.
    (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the contracting officer may 
authorize the contractor to solicit or perform this type of work (except 
work in the same or similar technical area) if the contracting officer 
determines that the situation will not pose a potential for technical 
bias or unfair competitive advantage.
    (d) Disclosure after award.
    (1) The contractor warrants that to the best of its knowledge and 
belief, and except as otherwise set forth in this contract, it does not 
have any organizational conflicts of interest as defined in 48 CFR 
2009.570-2.
    (2) The contractor agrees that, if after award, it discovers 
organizational conflicts of interest with respect to this contract, it 
shall make an immediate and full disclosure in writing to the 
contracting officer. This statement must include a description of the 
action which the contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid or 
mitigate such conflicts. The NRC may, however, terminate the contract if 
termination is in the best interest of the government.
    (3) It is recognized that the scope of work of a task-order-type 
contract necessarily encompasses a broad spectrum of activities. 
Consequently, if this is a task-order-type contract, the contractor 
agrees that it will disclose all proposed new work involving NRC 
licensees or applicants which comes within the scope of work of the 
underlying contract. Further, if this contract involves work at a 
licensee or applicant site, the contractor agrees to exercise diligence 
to discover and disclose any new work at that licensee or applicant 
site. This disclosure must be made before the submission of a bid or 
proposal to the utility or other regulated entity and must be received 
by the NRC at least 15 days before the proposed award date in any event, 
unless a written justification demonstrating urgency and due diligence 
to discover and disclose is provided by the contractor and approved by 
the contracting officer. The disclosure must include the statement of 
work, the dollar value of the proposed contract, and any other documents 
that are needed to fully describe the proposed work for the regulated 
utility or other

[[Page 499]]

regulated entity. NRC may deny approval of the disclosed work only when 
the NRC has issued a task order which includes the technical area and, 
if site-specific, the site, or has plans to issue a task order which 
includes the technical area and, if site-specific, the site, or when the 
work violates paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3) or (c)(4) of this section.
    (e) Access to and use of information.

    As prescribed at 2014.201-670(b), insert the following provision in 
applicable solicitations:

                             Bid Evaluation

    (a) Award will be made to that responsive, responsible bidder within 
the meaning of FAR subpart 9.1 whose total bid amount, as set forth by 
the bidder in Section B of this Invitation for Bid, constitutes the 
lowest overall evaluated final contract price to the Government based 
upon the requirements as set forth in the schedule. Bids will be 
evaluated for purposes of award by first ascertaining the sum of the 
total amount for each of the items specified in Section B of this 
solicitation. This will constitute the bidder's ``Total Bid Amount.''
    (b) Bidders shall insert a definite price or indicate ``no charge'' 
in the blank space provided for each item and/or sub-item listed in 
Section B. Unless expressly provided for herein, no additional charge 
will be allowed for work performed under the contract other than the 
unit prices stipulated for each such item and/or sub-item.
    (c) Any bid which is materially unbalanced as to price for the 
separate items specified in Section B of this IFB may be rejected as 
nonresponsive. An unbalanced bid is defined as one which is based on 
prices which, in the opinion of the NRC, are significantly less than 
cost for some work and/or prices that may be significantly overstated 
for other work.
    (d) Separation charges, in any form, are not solicited. Bids 
containing charges for discontinuance, termination, failure to exercise 
an option, or for any other purpose will cause the bid to be rejected as 
nonresponsive.
    (e) A preaward on-site survey of the bidder's facilities, equipment, 
etc., in accordance with FAR 9.105 and 9.106 may be made by 
representatives of the Commission for the purpose of determining whether 
the bidder is responsible within the meaning of FAR 9.1, and whether the 
bidder possesses qualifications that are conducive to the production of 
work that will meet the requirements, specifications, and provisions of 
this contract. Also, if requested by the Commission, the prospective 
contractor may be required to submit statements within * hours after 
receiving the request:
    (1) Concerning their ability to meet any of the minimum standards 
set forth in FAR 9.104,
    (2) Samples of work, and
    (3) Names and addresses of additional clients, Government agencies 
and/or commercial firms which the bidder is now doing or had done 
business with.
    (f) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, the award of any 
contract resulting from this solicitation will be made on an ``all or 
none'' basis. Thus, bids submitted on fewer than the items listed in 
Section B of this IFB, or on fewer than the estimated quantity, will 
cause the bid to be rejected as nonresponsive.

    (a) The following individuals are considered to be essential to the 
successful performance of the work hereunder:
    * * *
    The contractor agrees that personnel may not be removed from the 
contract work or replaced without compliance with paragraphs (b) and (c) 
of this section.
    (b) If one or more of the key personnel, for whatever reason, 
becomes, or is expected to become, unavailable for work under this 
contract for a continuous period exceeding 30 work days, or is expected 
to devote substantially less effort to the work than indicated in the 
proposal or initially anticipated, the contractor shall immediately 
notify the contracting officer and shall, subject to the concurrence of 
the contracting officer, promptly replace the personnel with personnel 
of at least substantially equal ability and qualifications.
    (c) Each request for approval of substitutions must be in writing 
and contain a detailed explanation of the circumstances necessitating 
the proposed substitutions. The request must also contain a complete 
resume for the proposed substitute and other information requested or 
needed by the contracting officer to evaluate the proposed substitution. 
The contracting officer or his/her authorized representative shall 
evaluate the request and promptly notify the contractor of his or her 
approval or disapproval in writing.
    (d) If the contracting officer determines that suitable and timely 
replacement of key personnel who have been reassigned, terminated, or 
have otherwise become unavailable for the contract work is not 
reasonably forthcoming, or that the resultant reduction of productive 
effort would be so substantial as to impair the successful completion of 
the contract or the service order, the contract may be terminated by the 
contracting officer for default or for the convenience of the 
Government, as appropriate. If the contracting officer finds the 
contractor at fault for the condition, the contract price or fixed fee 
may be equitably adjusted downward to compensate the Government for any 
resultant delay, loss, or damage.

officer may result in an unnecessary delay in the contractor's 
performance and may even result in the contractor expending funds for 
unallowable costs under the contract.

instruction or direction or upon the contract action to be taken with 
respect thereto is subject to 52.233-1--Disputes.

[[Page 505]]

            Award Notification and Commitment of Public Funds

    (a) All offerors will be notified of their selection or nonselection 
as soon as possible. Formal notification of nonselection for 
unrestricted awards may not be made until a contract has been awarded. 
Pursuant to requirements of FAR 15.1001(b)(2), preliminary notification 
will be provided before the award for small business set-aside 
procurements on negotiated procurements.
    (b) It is also brought to your attention that the contracting

expenditure of public funds in connection with this procurement. This 
means that unless provided in a contract document or specifically 
authorized by the contracting officer, NRC technical personnel may not 
issue contract modifications, give informal contractual commitments, or 
otherwise bind, commit, or obligate the NRC contractually. Informal 
contractual commitments include:
    (1) Encouraging a potential contractor to incur costs prior to 
receiving a contract;
    (2) Requesting or requiring a contractor to make changes under a 
contract without formal contract modifications;
    (3) Encouraging a contractor to incur costs under a cost-
reimbursable contract in excess of those costs contractually allowable; 
and
    (4) Committing the Government to a course of action with regard to a 
potential contract, contract change, claim, or dispute.

    As prescribed in 2015.670(a), insert the following provision in 
applicable solicitations:

               Contract Award and Evaluation of Proposals

    (a) By use of numerical and narrative scoring techniques, proposals 
are evaluated against the evaluation factors specified in paragraph * 
below. These factors are listed in their relative order of importance. 
Award is made to the offeror:
    (1) Whose proposal is technically acceptable;
    (2) Whose technical/cost relationship is most advantageous to the 
Government; and
    (3) Who is considered to be responsbile within the meaning of 
Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 9.1.
    (b) Although cost is a factor in the evaluation of proposals, 
technical merit in the evaluation criteria set forth below is a more 
significant factor in the selection of a contractor. Further, to be 
selected for an award, the proposed cost must be realistic and 
reasonable.
    (c) The Government may:
    (1) Reject any or all offers if the action is in the public 
interest;
    (2) Accept other than the lowest offer; and
    (3) Waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

offers received, without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer 
should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and 
technical standpoints.
    (e) A separate cost analysis is performed on each cost proposal. To 
provide a common base for evaluation of cost proposals, the level of 
effort data must be expressed in staff hours. Where a Contractor 
Spending Plan (CSP) is required by other provisions of this 
solicitation, consideration is given to the Plan for completeness, 
reasonableness, and as a measure of effective management of the effort.
    (f) In making the above determination, an analysis is performed by 
the Government that takes into consideration the results of the 
technical evaluation and cost analysis.

<R04>
              Subpart 2101.1--Purpose, Authority, Issuance


<R05>
2101.101  Purpose.

    (a) This subpart establishes Chapter 21, Office of Personnel 
Management Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance Federal Acquisition 
Regulation, within title 48, the Federal Acquisition Regulations System, 
of the Code of Federal Regulations. The short title of this regulation 
shall be LIFAR.
    (b) The purpose of the LIFAR is to implement and supplement the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) specifically for acquiring and 
administering a contract, or contracts, for life insurance under the 
Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) Program.


<R05>
2101.102  Authority.

    (a) The LIFAR is issued by the Director of the Office of Personnel 
Management in accordance with the authority of 5 U.S.C. Chapter 87 and 
other applicable laws and regulations.
    (b) The LIFAR does not replace or incorporate regulations found at 5 
CFR Parts 870 through 874, which provide the substantive policy guidance 
for administration of the FEGLI program under 5 U.S.C. chapter 87. The 
following is the order of precedence in interpreting a contract 
provision under the FEGLI Program:
    (1) 5 U.S.C. chapter 87.
    (2) 5 CFR parts 870 through 874.
    (3) 48 CFR chapters 1 and 21.
    (4) The FEGLI Program contract.


<R05>
2101.103  Applicability.

    The FAR is generally applicable to contracts negotiated in the FEGLI 
Program pursuant to 5 U.S.C. chapter 87. The LIFAR implements and 
supplements the FAR where necessary to identify basic and significant 
acquisition policies unique to the FEGLI Program.


<R05>
2101.104  Issuance.


<R05>
2101.104-1  Publication and code arrangement.

    (a) The LIFAR and its subsequent changes are published in:
    (1) Daily issues of the Federal Register; and
    (2) The Code of Federal Regulations, in cumulative form.
    (b) The LIFAR is issued as chapter 21 of title 48 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations.


<R05>
2101.104-2  Arrangement of regulations.

    (a) General. The LIFAR conforms with the arrangement and numbering 
system prescribed by FAR 1.104 and 1.303. However, when a FAR part or 
subpart is adequate for use without further OPM implementation or 
supplementation, there will be no corresponding LIFAR part, subpart, 
etc. The LIFAR is to be used in conjunction with the FAR and the order 
for use is:
    (1) FAR;
    (2) LIFAR.
    (b) Citation. (1) In formal documents, such as legal briefs, 
citation of Chapter 21 material that has been published in the Federal 
Register will be to title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
    (2) In informal documents, any section of chapter 21 may be 
identified as

[[Page 516]]

``LIFAR'' followed by the section number.


<R04>
             Subpart 2101.3--Agency Acquisition Regulations


<R05>
2101.301  Policy.

    (a) Procedures, contract clauses, and other aspects of the 
acquisition process for contracts in the FEGLI Program shall be 
consistent with the principles of the FAR. Changes to the FAR that are 
otherwise authorized by statute or applicable regulation, dictated by 
the practical realities associated with certain unique aspects of life 
insurance, or necessary to satisfy specific needs of the Office of 
Personnel Management, to the extent not otherwise regulated in the FAR, 
shall be implemented as amendments to the LIFAR and published in the 
Federal Register, or as deviations to the FAR in accordance with FAR 
subpart 1.4.
    (b) Internal procedures, instructions, and guides which are 
necessary to clarify or implement the LIFAR within OPM may be issued by 
agency officials designated by the Director, OPM. Normally, such 
designations will be specified in the OPM Administrative Manual, which 
is routinely available to agency employees and will be made available to 
interested outside parties upon request. Clarifying or implementing 
procedures, instructions, and guides issued pursuant to this section of 
the LIFAR must:
    (1) Be consistent with the policies and procedures contained in this 
regulation as implemented and supplemented from time to time; and
    (2) Follow the format, arrangement, and numbering system of this 
regulation to the extent practicable.


<R05>
2101.370  Effective date of LIFAR amendments.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, an 
amendment to the LIFAR is effective when promulgated or as provided in 
the amendment.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, if 
the LIFAR is amended in a manner which would increase the 
contractor's(s') costs or liabilities under the contract(s), the 
amendment will be made effective the October 1 subsequent to the 
amendment's promulgation, unless the contractor(s) agree(s) in writing 
to an earlier date.
    (c) Except as provided for in paragraph (d) of this section, if the 
LIFAR is amended between July 31 and October 1 in a manner which would 
increase the contractor's(s') costs or liabilities under the 
contract(s), the amendment will not be effective until the October 1 in 
the year following the amendment's promulgation, unless the 
contractor(s) agree(s) in writing to an earlier date.
    (d) Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are not applicable to 
amendments that are necessary to implement new or existing legislation.

    (a) OPM prepares and makes available to enrolled Federal employees a 
booklet describing the provisions of the FEGLI Program which includes 
information about eligibility, enrollment, and general procedures. The 
booklet also operates as a certification of the employee's enrollment in 
the FEGLI Program. Because all necessary information is made available 
by OPM, advertising directed specifically at Federal employees and life 
insurance agent contacts with Federal employees for the purpose of 
selling FEGLI Program coverage are prohibited.

comparisons or using disparaging or minimizing techniques to compare its 
other products or services to the benefits of the FEGLI Program. The 
contractor agrees that any advertising material authorized and released 
by the contractor which mentions the FEGLI Program shall be truthful and 
not misleading, and shall present an accurate statement of FEGLI Program 
benefits. The contractor will use its best efforts to assure that its 
life insurance agents are aware of and abide by this prohibition.
    (c) The contractor's failure to conform to the requirements of this 
subpart shall be considered by OPM in the determination of the service 
charge prenegotiation objective.

    FAR part 5 has no practical application to the FEGLO Program because

        Subpart 2109.4--Debarment, Suspension, and Ineligibility


<R05>
2109.408  Certification regarding debarment, suspension, proposed debarment and other responsibility matters.

    FAR subpart 9.4 is implemented by changing the FAR offeror's 
certification at FAR 52.209-5 (which is part of a solicitation) to a 
pre-contract certificate and a contract clause. These provisions reflect 
the FEGLI Program's statutory exemption from competitive bidding (5 
U.S.C. 8709), which obviates the issuance of solicitations.


<R05>
2109.409  Certification and contract clause.

    (a) The contracting officer may require the precontract certificate 
in 2152.209-70 to be filed prior to or during negotiations.
    (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 2152.209-71 
in all FEGLI Program contracts.


<R04>
    Subpart 2109.70--Minimum Standards for FEGLI Program Contractors


<R05>
2109.7001  Minimum standards for FEGLI Program contractors.

    (a) The contractor must meet the requirements of chapter 87 of title 
5, United States Code; parts 870, 871, 872, 873, and 874 of title 5, 
Code of Federal Regulations; chapter 1 of title 48, Code of Federal 
Regulations, and the standards in this subpart. The contractor shall 
continue to meet these and the following statutory and regulatory 
requirements while under contract with OPM. Failure to meet these 
requirements and standards is cause for OPM's termination of the 
contract in accordance with part 2149 of this chapter.
    (b) The contractor must actually be engaged in the life insurance 
business and must be licensed to transact life and accidental death and 
dismemberment insurance under the laws of all the States and the

2110.7000  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes mandatory specifications for performance 
under FEGLI Program contracts.


<R05>
2110.7001  Definitions.

    Investment income, as used in this subpart, means the net amount on 
an investment of FEGLI Program funds earned by the contractor after 
deducting reasonable, necessary, and properly allocated investment 
expenses.
    Significant event, as used in this subpart, means any occurrence or 
anticipated occurrence that might reasonably be expected to have a 
material effect upon the contractor's ability to meet its obligations 
under the LIFAR.


<R05>
2110.7002  Contractor investment of FEGLI Program funds.

    (a) The contractor is required to invest and reinvest all FEGLI 
Program funds on hand, including any attributable to the special 
contingency reserve (as used in 5 U.S.C. 8712), until needed to 
discharge promptly the obligations incurred under the contract. Within 
the constraints of safety and liquidity of investments, the contractor 
shall seek to maximize investment income.
    (b) The contractor is required to credit income earned from its 
investment of FEGLI Program funds to the FEGLI Program. Thus, the 
contractor must be able to allocate investment income to the FEGLI 
Program in an appropriate manner. If the contractor fails to invest 
funds on hand, properly allocate investment income, or credit any income 
due to the contract, for whatever reason, it shall return or credit any 
investment income lost to OPM or the FEGLI Program, retroactive to the 
date that such funds should have been originally invested in accordance 
with 2152.210-70.

<R04>
                    Subpart 2115.6--Source Selection


<R05>
2115.602  Applicability.

    FAR Subpart 15.6 has no practical application to the FEGLI Program 
because prospective contractors (insurance companies) are considered for 
inclusion in the FEGLI Program in accordance with criteria provided in 5 
U.S.C. chapter 87, LIFAR 2109.7001, and the following:
    (a) Applications must be signed by an individual with legal 
authority to enter into a contract on behalf of the company for the 
dollar level of claims and expenses anticipated.
    (b) Applications will be reviewed for evidence of substantial 
compliance in the following areas:
    (1) Management: Stable management with experience pertinent to the 
life insurance industry and, in particular, large group management; 
sufficient operating experience to enable OPM to evaluate past and 
expected future performance.
    (2) Marketing: Past ability to attract and retain large group 
contracts; steady or increasing amount of group life insurance in force.
    (3) Legal expertise: Demonstrated competence in researching, 
compiling, and implementing various Federal and State laws that may 
impact payment of benefits; ability to defend legal challenges to 
payment of benefits.
    (4) Financial condition: Establishment of firm budget projections 
and demonstrated success in keeping costs at or below those projections 
on a regular basis; evidence of the ability to sustain operations in the 
future and to meet obligations under the contract OPM might enter into 
with the company; adequate reserve levels; assets exceeding liabilities.
    (5) Establishment of office: Ability to establish an administrative 
office capable of assessing, tracking, and paying claims.
    (6) Internal controls: Ability to establish and maintain a system of 
internal control that provides reasonable assurance that the payment of 
claims and other expenses will be in compliance with legal, regulatory, 
and contractual guidelines; funds, property, and other FEGLI Program 
assets will be safeguarded against waste, loss, unauthorized use, or 
misappropriation; and revenues and expenditures applicable to FEGLI 
Program operations will be properly recorded and accounted for to permit 
the preparation of timely and accurate financial reporting and to 
maintain accountability over assets.


<R04>
                    Subpart 2115.8--Price Negotiation


<R05>
2115.802  Policy.

    Pricing of FEGLI Program premium rates is governed by 5 U.S.C. 8707, 
8708, 8711, 8714a, 8714b, and 8714c. FAR Subpart 15.8 shall be 
implemented by applying cost analysis policies and procedures. To the 
extent that reasonable or good faith actuarial estimates are used for 
pricing, such estimates will be deemed acceptable and, if inaccurate, 
will not constitute defective pricing.


<R04>
                         Subpart 2115.9--Profit


<R05>
2115.902  Policy.

    (a) Risk charge. (1) Section 8711(d) of title 5, United States Code, 
provides for payment of a risk charge to FEGLI Program contractors as 
compensation for the risk assumed under the FEGLI Program. It is 
appropriate to pay such a charge when substantial risk is borne by the 
contractor; that is, when the balance in the Employees' Life Insurance 
Fund is no larger than five times annual claims.
    (2) The risk charge is determined by agreement between the 
contractor and OPM. The amount of risk charge shall be specified in the 
contract.
    (b) Waiver of the risk charge. (1) When the Fund balance is greater 
than five times annual claims, OPM and the contractor may agree that the 
contractor will relinquish the risk charge in favor of a profit 
opportunity in the form of a service charge for the contractor. The 
service charge so determined shall be the total service charge that may 
be negotiated for the contract and shall encompass any service charge 
(whether entitled service charge, profit, fee, contribution to 
surpluses, etc.) that may have been negotiated by the prime contractor 
with any subcontractor. At no time may both a risk charge and a service 
charge be paid for the same portion of a policy year.

[[Page 524]]

    (2) Once agreement to relinquish the risk charge is made, the 
agreement may not be cancelled unless OPM and the contractor mutually 
agree to reinstitute payment of a risk charge; or unless the Fund 
balance falls below the level defined in 2115.902(a) and 30 days notice 
of cancellation is provided; or unless the contractor or OPM provide 
notice of cancellation for any reason 1 year prior to the date 
cancellation is sought.
    (c) Any profit prenegotiation objective (service charge) will be 
determined on the basis of a weighted guidelines structured approach.


<R05>
2115.905  Profit analysis factors.

    (a) The OPM contracting officer will apply a weighted guidelines 
method when developing the prenegotiation objective (service charge) for 
the FEGLI Program contract. In accordance with the factors defined in 
FAR 15.905-1, OPM will apply the appropriate weights derived from the 
ranges specified in paragraph (b) of this section and will determine the 
prenegotiation objective based on the contractor's Basic and Family 
Optional insurance claims paid in the previous contract year.
    (1) Contractor performance. OPM will consider such elements as the 
accurate and timely processing of benefit claims, the volume and 
validity of complaints received by OPM, effectiveness of internal 
controls systems in place, the timeliness and adequacy of reports on 
operations, and responsiveness to OPM offices, enrollees, beneficiaries, 
and Congress as measures of economical and efficient contract 
performance. This factor will be judged apart from the contractor's 
basic responsibility for contract compliance and will be a measure of 
the extent and nature of the contractor's contribution to the FEGLI 
Program through the application of managerial expertise and effort. 
Evidence of effective contract performance will receive a plus weight, 
and poor performance or failure to comply with contract terms and 
conditions a zero weight. Innovations of benefit to the FEGLI Program 
will generally receive a plus weight; documented inattention or 
indifference to effective operations, a zero weight.
    (2) Contract cost risk. OPM will evaluate the contractor's risk 
annually in relation to the amount in the Employees' Life Insurance Fund 
and will evaluate this factor accordingly.
    (3) Federal socioeconomic programs. OPM will consider documented 
evidence of successful, contractor-initiated efforts to support such 
Federal socioeconomic programs as drug and substance abuse deterrents, 
and other concerns of the type enumerated in FAR 15.905-1(c) as a factor 
in negotiating profit. This factor will be related to the quality of the 
contractor's policies and procedures and the extent of unusual effort or 
achievement demonstrated. Evidence of effective support of Federal 
socioeconomic programs will result in a plus weight; indifference to 
Federal socioeconomic programs will result in a zero weight; and only 
deliberate failure to provide opportunities to persons and organizations 
that would benefit from these programs will result in a negative weight.
    (4) Capital investments. This factor is generally not applicable to 
FEGLI Program contracts because facilities capital cost of money may be 
an allowable administrative expense. Generally, this factor shall be 
given a weight of zero. However, special purpose facilities or 
investment costs of direct benefit to the FEGLI Program that are not 
recoverable as allowable or allocable administrative expenses may be 
taken into account in assigning a plus weight.
    (5) Cost Control. This factor is based on the contractor's 
previously demonstrated ability to perform effectively and economically. 
In addition, consideration will be given to measures taken by the 
contractor that result in productivity improvements and other cost 
containment accomplishments that will be of future benefit to the FEGLI 
Program. Examples are containment of costs associated with processing 
claims; success at preventing waste, loss, unauthorized use, or 
misappropriation of FEGLI Program assets; and success at limiting and 
recovering erroneous benefit payments.
    (6) Independent Development. Consideration will be given to 
independent contractor-initiated efforts, such as the development of a 
unique and enhanced customer support system, that

[[Page 525]]

are of demonstrated value to the FEGLI Program and for which 
developmental costs have not been recovered directly or indirectly 
through allowable or allocable administrative expenses. This factor will 
be used to provide additional profit opportunities based upon an 
assessment of the contractor's investment and risk in developing 
techniques, methods, practices, etc., having viability to the Program at 
large. Improvements and innovations recognized and rewarded under any 
other profit factor cannot be considered.
    (b) The weight ranges for each factor to be used in the weighted 
guidelines approach are set forth below:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Profit factor                        Weight ranges     
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Contractor performance......................              0 to +.0005

<R04>
                  Subpart 2116.2--Fixed-Price Contracts


<R05>
2116.270  FEGLI Program contracts.

    FEGLI Program contracts will be fixed price with limited cost 
redetermination plus fixed fee. The premium to the contractor will be 
based on an estimate of benefits and administrative costs, plus the 
fixed service or risk charge, and will be determined annually. Claims 
costs, including benefits and administrative expenses, in excess of 
premiums will be paid up to the amount in the Employees' Life Insurance 
Fund. Payment for costs exceeding the amount in the Fund are the 
responsibility of the contractor and reinsurers. The fee is fixed at the 
inception of each contract year. The fee does not vary with the actual 
costs, but may be adjusted as a result of changes in the work to be 
performed under the contract. The fee will be in the form of either a 
risk charge or a service charge.
    (a) Risk charge. The risk charge will be determined as prescribed in 
5 U.S.C. 8711(d) and paragraph 2115.902(a)(2) of this subchapter. It 
will consist of a negotiated amount which will reflect the risk assumed 
by the contractor and the reinsurers and may be adjusted as a result of 
increased or decreased risk under the contract. When the applicable fee 
is a risk charge, no service charge shall be payable for the same period 
of time.
    (b) Service charge. The amount of the service charge will be 
determined using a weighted guidelines structured approach in accordance 
with 2115.905 and negotiated with the contractor at the beginning of the 
contract term. When the applicable fee is a service charge, no risk 
charge will be paid for the same portion of a policy year in which a 
service charge is paid.


<R05>
2116.270-1  Contract clauses.

    (a) The clause at 2152.216-70 shall be inserted in all FEGLI Program 
contracts when a risk charge is negotiated.

contracts when a service charge is negotiated.

implemented by changing the word ``offeror'' to ``Contractor'' and the 
word ``solicitation'' to ``contract'' wherever they appear in the text 
to reflect the FEGLI Program's statutory exemption from competitive 
bidding (5 U.S.C. 8709), which obviates the issuance of solicitations.

    Records retained by FEGLI Program contractors on Federal insureds

function of paying FEGLI Program claims and are not maintained to 
accomplish an agency function of OPM. Consequently, the records do not 
fall within the provisions of the Privacy Act. Nevertheless, OPM

    (b) For purposes of the limited cost redetermination of a FEGLI

    (a) 5 U.S.C. 8714(c)(1) prohibits the imposition of taxes, fees, or 
other monetary payment on FEGLI Program premiums by any State, the 
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any political 
subdivision or governmental authority of those entities.
    (b) Paragraph (a) of this section shall not be construed to exempt 
the contractor from the imposition, payment, or collection of a tax, 
fee, or other monetary payment on the net income or profit accruing to 
or realized by it from business conducted under the FEGLI Program if the 
tax, fee, or payment is applicable to a broad range of business

<R04>
                      Subpart 2131.1--Applicability


<R05>
2131.103  Contracts with Commercial Organizations.

    The contracting officer shall incorporate the cost principles and 
procedures of FAR subpart 31.2 and this part by reference in all FEGLI 
Program contracts because of the nature of a fixed price with limited 
cost redetermination plus fixed fee contract.


<R05>
2131.109  Advance agreements.

    FAR 31.109 is applicable to FEGLI Program contracts, except that 
precontract costs and nonrecurring costs that exceed $25,000 shall not 
be allowed in the absence of an advance agreement.


<R04>
         Subpart 2131.2--Contracts With Commercial Organizations


<R05>
2131.201  General.


<R05>
2131.201-5  Credits.

    The provisions of FAR 31.201-5 shall apply to income, rebates and 
other credits resulting from benefit payments that include, but are not 
limited to--
    (a) Uncashed and returned checks.
    (b) Refunds attributable to litigation with regard to payments of 
FEGLI Program life insurance monies.
    (c) Erroneous benefit payment, refunds, overpayment, and duplicate 
payment recoveries.
    (d) Escheatments.


<R05>
2131.203  Indirect costs.

    The provisions of FAR 31.203 apply to the allocation of indirect 
costs by means of a ``dividend or retention formula.''


<R05>
2131.205  Selected costs.


<R05>
2131.205-1  Public relations and advertising costs.

    The provisions of FAR 31.205-1 shall be modified to include the 
following:
    (a) Costs of media messages are allowable if approved by the 
contracting officer and all of the following criteria are met:
    (1) The primary objective of the message is to disseminate 
information on general health and fitness or encouraging healthful 
lifestyles;
    (2) The costs of the contractor's messages are allocated to all 
underwritten and non-underwritten lines of business; and
    (3) The contracting officer approves the total dollar amount of the 
contractor's messages to be charged to the FEGLI Program in advance of 
the policy year.
    (b) Costs of media messages that inform enrollees about the FEGLI 
Program are allowable if approved by the contracting officer.
    (c) In those instances where contracting officer approval of the 
total dollar amount is not solicited in advance, it is incumbent upon 
the contractor to

[[Page 529]]

show the contracting officer, for subsequent approval, that the costs 
are reasonable and do not unduly burden the administrative cost to the 
contract.
    (d) Costs of messages that are intended to, or which have the 
primary effect of, calling favorable attention to the contractor or 
subcontractor for the purpose of enhancing its overall image or selling 
its product or services are not allowable.


<R05>
2131.205-3  Bad debts.

    Erroneous benefit payments. If the contractor or OPM determines that 
a FEGLI Program benefit has been paid in error for any reason, the 
contractor shall make a diligent effort to recover such erroneous 
payment from the recipient. The contracting officer shall allow an 
unrecovered erroneous payment to be charged to the contract provided the 
contractor demonstrates that the recovery of the erroneous payment was 
attempted in accordance with a system that is approved under 2146.270(b) 
and that either a diligent effort was made to recover the erroneous 
overpayment or it would not be cost effective to recover the erroneous 
overpayment. The contractor's compliance with a system that is approved 
under 2146.270(b) will be deemed to be a diligent effort to recover the 
erroneous overpayment.


<R05>
2131.205-6  Compensation for personal services.

    FAR 31.205-6 is supplemented as follows: Overtime on a FEGLI Program 
contract normally would meet the conditions specified in FAR 22.103. 
Advance approval of the contracting officer is not required for 
overtime, extra-pay shifts, and multi-shifts.


<R05>
2131.205-32  Precontract costs.

    Precontract costs shall be allowable in accordance with FAR Part 31, 
but precontract costs that exceed $25,000 shall not be allowable except 
to the extent allowable under an advance agreement negotiated in 
accordance with 2131.109.


<R05>
2131.205-38  Selling costs.

    Selling costs are not allowable costs to FEGLI contracts except to 
the extent that they are attributable to conducting contract 
negotiations with the Government and for liaison activities involving 
ongoing contract administration, including the conduct of informational 
and enrollment activities as directed by the contracting officer.


<R05>
2131.205-41  Taxes.

    (a) FAR 31.205-41, as modified in paragraphs (b) through (e), is 
applicable to contracts in the FEGLI Program.
    (b) As long as 5 U.S.C. 8714(c) or other Federal law prohibits the 
imposition of taxes, fees, or other monetary payments on FEGLI Program 
premiums by any State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, or any other political subdivision or governmental 
authority of those entities, payment of such preempted tax is an 
unallowable expense under FAR 31.205-41(b)(3).
    (c) Paragraph (b)(1) of FAR 31.205-41 is not applicable to the FEGLI 
Program.
    (d) Notwithstanding any other provision in FAR 31.205-41, the 
portion of the contractor's income or excess profits taxes allocated to 
the FEGLI Program, except those allocated to the risk charge or the 
service charge, are allowable costs under the FEGLI Program, including 
any income or excess profit taxes that arise from the operation of this 
paragraph. Income or excess profits taxes allocated to the risk charge 
or the service charge are not allowable costs.
    (e) Notwithstanding any other provision in FAR 31.205-41, an amount 
equal to the ``DAC Tax'' is an allowable tax expense under FAR 31.205-
41. ``DAC Tax'' means an amount equal to: (1) the amount of the 
contractor's Federal, state, and local income tax allocated to payments 
under the FEGLI Program, less (2) the amount of the contractor's 
Federal, state, and local income tax allocated to payments under the 
FEGLI Program computed without regard to the operation of 26 U.S.C. 848, 
which requires that certain policy acquisition expenses be capitalized 
over a 60- or 120-month period, plus (3) the amount of the increase, if 
any, in the contractor's Federal, state, and local income tax that 
results from the operation of this section 2131.205-41(e).

[[Page 530]]


<R05>
2131.205-43  Trade, business, technical and professional activity costs.

    (a) FEGLI Program contractors shall seek the advance written 
approval of the contracting officer for allowability of all or part of 
the costs associated with trade, business, technical, and professional 
activities when the allocable costs of such participation to the FEGLI 
Program will exceed $2,500 annually and the contractor allocates more 
than 50 percent of the membership cost of a trade, business, technical, 
or professional organization to the FEGLI Program.
    (b) When approval of costs for membership in an organization is 
required, the contractor must demonstrate conclusively that membership 
in such an organization and participation in its activities extend 
beyond the contractual relationship with OPM, have a reasonable 
relationship to providing services to FEGLI Program insureds, and that 
the organization is not engaged in activities such as those cited in FAR 
31.205-22 (lobbying costs) for which costs are not allowable.


<R05>
2131.205-70  Major subcontractor service charge.

    In a subcontract for enrollment and eligibility determinations, 
administration of claims and payment of benefits and any other 
subcontract for which prior approval is necessary, when costs are 
determined on the basis of actual costs incurred, any amount that 
exceeds the allowable cost of a major subcontract (whether entitled 
service charge, incentive fee, profit, fee, surplus, or any other title) 
is not allowable under the contract. Amounts which exceed allowable 
costs may be paid to a major subcontractor only from the risk charge or 
service charge negotiated between OPM and the contractor.


<R05>
2131.205-71  Reinsurer administrative expense costs.

    A charge of $500 per policy year per reinsurer of the FEGLI Program 
as set forth in the contract is an allowable cost when documented 
through an internal accounting entry of the contractor and actually 
paid. This amount is deemed to be sufficient to reimburse reinsurers for 
the minor administrative expenses incurred in reinsuring the FEGLI 
Program.


<R05>
2131.270  Contract clauses.

2132.170  Recurring premium payments to contractors.

    OPM and the contractor will concur on an estimate of benefits and 
administrative costs plus the fixed service or risk charge for the 
forthcoming contract year, as specified in the contract. The annual 
premium to the contractor will be determined based on this estimate. The 
premium will be determined annually and will be provided to the 
contractor in 12 equal monthly installments due on the first day of each 
month. Following the close of the contract year, a reconciliation of 
premiums, benefits, and other costs will be performed as a limited cost 
redetermination.

<R05>
2132.607  Tax credit.

    FAR 32.607 has no practical application to FEGLI Program contracts. 
The statutory provisions at 5 U.S.C. 8707 and 8708 authorize joint 
enrollee and Government contributions to the Employees' Life Insurance 
Fund. Because the Fund is comprised of contributions by enrollees as 
well as the Government, contractors may not offset debts to the Fund by 
a tax credit that is solely a Government obligation.


<R05>
2132.617  Contract clause.

    The clause at FAR 52.232-17 is modified in FEGLI Program contracts 
to exclude the parenthetical phrase ``(net of any applicable tax credit 
under the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 1481)).''

    Insurance premium payments and a special contingency reserve are 
made available to FEGLI Program contractors in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 
8712 and 8714.


<R05>
2132.771  Non-commingling of FEGLI Program funds.

    (a) FEGLI Program funds shall be maintained in such a manner as to 
be separately identifiable from other assets of the contractor. Cash and 
investment balances reported on the FEGLI Program Annual Accounting 
Statement must be supported by the contractor's books and records.
    (b) This requirement may be modified by the contracting officer in 
accordance with the clause at 2152.232-71 when adequate accounting and 
other controls are in effect. If the requirement is modified, such 
modification will remain in effect until rescinded by OPM.

operations). The contractor also shall receive a risk or service charge 
for the full period after contract termination during which services are 
continued, not to exceed a pro rata portion of the risk or service 
charge for the final contract year. The amount of risk or service charge 
shall be based upon the accurate and timely processing of benefit 
claims, the volume and validity of complaints received by OPM, the 
timeliness and adequacy of reports on operations, and responsiveness to 
OPM offices, enrollees, beneficiaries, and Congress.

<R05>
2146.201  General.

    (a) This part prescribes policies and procedures to ensure that 
services acquired under the FEGLI Program contract conform to the 
contract's quality requirements.
    (b) OPM shall evaluate the contractor's system of internal controls 
under the quality assurance program required by 2146.270 prior to each 
contract year and will acknowledge in writing whether or not the system 
is consistent with the requirements set forth in this Subpart. After the 
initial review, each annual review may be limited to changes in the 
contractor's internal control guidelines. However, a limited review does 
not diminish the contractor's obligation to apply the full internal 
control system.

[[Page 534]]


<R05>
2146.270  FEGLI Program quality assurance requirements.

    (a) The contractor shall develop and apply a quality assurance 
program specifying procedures for assuring contract quality, as directed 
by the contracting officer. At a minimum, the program should include 
procedures to address:
    (1) Accuracy of payments and recovery of overpayments;
    (2) Timeliness of payments to beneficiaries;
    (3) Quality of services and responsiveness to beneficiaries;
    (4) Quality of service and responsiveness to OPM; and
    (5) Detection and recovery of fraudulent claims.
    (b) The contractor shall prepare overpayment recovery guidelines to 
include a system of internal control for approval annually by the 
contracting officer. The contracting officer may withdraw such approval 
with 90 days' notice of prospective withdrawal.
    (c) The contracting officer may order the correction of a deficiency 
or a modification in the contractor's services and/or quality assurance 
program. The contractor shall take the necessary action promptly to 
implement the contracting officer's order. If the contracting officer 
orders the correction of a deficiency or a modification of the 
contractor's services and/or quality assurance program pursuant to this 
paragraph after the contract year has begun, the costs incurred in 
correcting the deficiency or making the modification will not be 
considered to the contractor's detriment in the cost control factor of 
the service charge [if applicable] for the following contract year. 
However, if there is a deficiency, the deficiency itself may be taken 
into consideration.

<R05>
2149.002  Applicability.

    (a) Termination. (1) Termination of FEGLI Program contracts is 
controlled by 5 U.S.C. 8709(c) and this chapter. The procedures for 
termination of FEGLI Program contracts shall be those contained in FAR 
part 49. For the purpose of this part, terminate means to 
``discontinue'' as used in 5 U.S.C. 8709(c).
    (2) A life insurance contract entered into by OPM may be terminated 
by OPM at any time for default by the contractor. A life insurance 
contract entered into by OPM may be terminated at the end of the 31st 
day after default for nonpayment by OPM [see 2152.232-70, Payments].
    (3) A life insurance contract entered into by OPM may be terminated 
for convenience of the Government 60 days after the contractor's receipt 
of OPM's notice to terminate.
    (4) The contractor may terminate its contract with OPM at the end of 
any policy year when notice of intent to terminate is given to OPM in 
writing at least 60 days prior to the end of the policy year (i.e., no 
later than July 31).
    (b) Continuation of services. The services under this contract are 
of vital interest to the Government and must be continued without 
interruption in the event the contract is terminated. Consequently, the 
contract termination procedures contained in this paragraph must be used 
in conjunction with 2137.102, 2137.110, and the provisions of the 
``Continuity of Services'' clause at 2152.237-70.
    (c) Settlement. The procedures for settlement of contracts after 
they are terminated shall be those contained in FAR Part 49.

    As prescribed in 2109.409(a), the contracting officer may require a 
potential contractor to provide the following certification:

 Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Proposed Debarment, and 
                 Other Responsibility Matters (Oct 1993)

    (a)(1) The undersigned certifies, to the best of its knowledge and 
belief, that--
    (i) The undersigned and/or any of its Principals--
    (A) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed 
for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any 
Federal agency;
    (B) Have (  ) have not (  ), within a 3-year period preceding this 
certification, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered 
against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in 
connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public 
(Federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal 
or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or 
commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or 
destruction of records, making false statements, or receiving stolen 
property; and
    (C) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently indicted for, or otherwise 
criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission 
of any of the offenses enumerated in subdivision (a)(2) of this clause.
    (ii) The undersigned has (  ) has not (  ), within a 3-year period 
preceding this certification, had one or more contracts terminated for 
default by any Federal agency.
    (2) ``Principals,'' for the purposes of this certification, means 
officers; directors; owners; partners; and persons having primary 
management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity 
(e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, 
or business segment, and similar positions).
    This certification concerns a matter within the jurisdiction of an 
agency of the United States and the making of a false, fictitious, or 
fraudulent certification may render the undersigned subject to 
prosecution under section 1001, title 18, United States Code.
    (b) The undersigned shall provide immediate written notice to the 
Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to the contract award, the 
undersigned learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted 
or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
    (c) A certification that any of the actions mentioned in paragraph 
(a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in the 
withholding of an award under a contract under the FEGLI Program. 
However, the certification, or the undersigned's failure to provide such 
additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer will be 
considered in connection with a determination of the undersigned's 
responsibility under LIFAR subpart 2109.70, Minimum Standards for FEGLI 
Program Contractors.

[[Page 538]]

    (d) Nothing contained in this certification shall be construed to 
require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good 
faith, the certification required by paragraph (a). The knowledge and 
information of the undersigned is not required to exceed that which is 
normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of 
business dealings.
    (e) The certification in (a) is a material representation of fact 
upon which reliance is placed during negotiation of a FEGLI Program 
contract. If it is later determined that the undersigned knowingly 
rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies 
available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the 
contract resulting from this certification for default.

Officer will be considered in connection with a determination of the 
Contractor's responsibility under LIFAR subpart 2109.70, Minimum 
Standards for FEGLI Program Contractors.

require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good

    As prescribed in 2131.270, insert the following clause:

                Accounting and Allowable Cost (Oct 1993)

    (a) Annual Accounting Statement. (1) The Contractor shall prepare 
annually an accounting statement summarizing the financial results of 
the FEGLI Program for the previous contract year. This statement shall 
be prepared in accordance with the requirements issued annually by OPM 
and shall be due to OPM in accordance with a date established by those 
requirements.

[[Page 541]]

    (2) The Contractor shall have the most recent financial statement 
for the FEGLI Program audited by an accounting firm that ascribes to the 
standards of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The 
report shall be submitted to OPM along with the annual accounting 
statement.
    (3) Based on the results of either the independent audit or a 
Government audit, the annual accounting statements for the FEGLI Program 
may be (i) adjusted by amounts found not to constitute properly 
allocable or allowable costs; or (ii) adjusted for prior overpayments or 
underpayments.
    (b) Definition of costs. (1) The allowable costs chargeable to the 
contract for a policy year shall be the actual, necessary, reasonable, 
and allocable amounts incurred with proper justification and accounting 
support, determined in accordance with Subpart 31.2 of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Subpart 2131.2 of the Federal Employees 
Group Life Insurance Program Acquisition Regulation (LIFAR) applicable 
on October 1 of each year, and the terms of this contract.
    (2) In the absence of specific contract terms to the contrary, 
contract costs shall be classified in accordance with the following 
criteria:
    (i) Benefits. Claims costs consist of payments made and costs 
incurred for life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment 
insurance on behalf of FEGLI Program subscribers, including interest 
paid on delayed claims, less any overpayments (subject to the terms of 
2131.205-3), refunds, or other credits received.
    (ii) Administrative expenses. Administrative expenses consist of all 
allocable, allowable, and reasonable expenses incurred in the 
adjudication of beneficiary claims or incurred in the Contractor's 
overall operation of the business. Unless otherwise provided in the 
contract, FAR, or LIFAR, administrative expenses include, but are not 
limited to, taxes, insurance and reinsurance premiums, the cost of 
investigation and settlement of policy claims, the cost of maintaining 
files regarding payment of claims, and legal expenses incurred in the 
litigation of benefit payments. Administrative expenses exclude the 
expenses related to investment income in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this 
clause.
    (iii) Investment income. Investment income represents the amount 
earned by the Contractor after deducting reasonable, necessary, and 
properly allocable investment expenses as a result of investing of FEGLI 
Program funds. The direct or allocable indirect expenses incurred with 
respect to the investment of Program funds, such as brokerage fees, are 
netted against investment income earned rather than as part of 
administrative expenses.
    (c) Certification of Annual Accounting Statement. (1) The Contractor 
shall certify the annual accounting statement in the form set forth in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this clause. The certificate shall be signed by the 
chief executive officer for the Contractor's FEGLI Program operations 
and the chief financial officer for the Contractor's FEGLI Program 
operations and shall be returned with the annual accounting statement.
    (2) The certification required shall be in the following form:

              Certification of Annual Accounting Statement

    This is to certify that I have reviewed this accounting statement 
and, to the best of my knowledge and belief, attest that:
    1. The statement was prepared in conformity with the guidelines 
issued by the Office of Personnel Management and fairly presents the 
financial results of this policy year in conformity with those 
guidelines;
    2. The costs included in the statement are allowable and allocable 
in accordance with the terms of the contract and with the cost 
principles of the Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance Program 
Acquisition Regulation (LIFAR) and the Federal Acquisition Regulation 
(FAR);
    3. Income, overpayments, refunds, and other credits made or owed in 
accordance with the terms of the contract and applicable cost principles 
have been included in the statement.

and additional payment by OPM or reimbursement by the Contractor will be

    (b) If OPM fails to provide the premium in full by the due date, a 
grace period of 31 days shall be granted to OPM for providing any 
premium due, unless OPM has previously given written notice to the 
Contractor that the contract is to be discontinued on the premium due 
date. The contract shall continue in force during the grace period.
    (c) If OPM fails to provide any premiums within the grace period, 
the contract shall be discontinued at the end of the 31st day of the 
grace period, unless the Contractor and OPM agree to continue the 
contract. OPM shall be liable to the Contractor for all premiums then 
due and unpaid. If during the grace period OPM presents written notice 
to the Contractor that the contract is to be discontinued before the 
expiration of the grace period, the contract shall be discontinued the 
later of the date of receipt of such written notice by the Contractor or 
the date specified by OPM for discontinuance. OPM shall be liable to the

    (f) In the event this contract is terminated in accordance with 
LIFAR Part 2149, the special contingency reserve held by the Contractor

investment balances reported on the FEGLI Program Annual Accounting 
Statement must be supported by the Contractor's books and records.
    (b) The Contractor may request a modification of this requirement 
from the Contracting Officer. The modification shall be requested in 
advance and the Contractor shall demonstrate that accounting techniques 
have been established that will clearly measure FEGLI Program cash and 
investment income (i.e., subsidiary ledgers). Reconciliations between 
amounts reported and actual amounts shown in accounting records shall be 
provided as supporting schedules to the Annual Accounting Statements.

Officer's written approval, an assignment of FEGLI Program funds shall 
be in force only for a period of 1 year from the date of the Contracting 
Officer's approval. However, assignments may be renewed upon their

    As prescribed in 2137.110, insert the following clause:

                    Continuity of Service (Oct 1993)

    (a) The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract 
are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption 
and that, upon contract expiration or termination, including termination 
by the Contractor, a successor, either the Government or another 
contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to (1) furnish 
phase-in training and (2) exercise its best efforts and cooperation to 
effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor.
    (b) The Contractor shall, upon the Contracting Officer's written 
notice, (1) furnish phase-in and phase-out services for up to 10 months 
after this contract expires and (2) negotiate in good faith a plan with 
a successor to determine the nature and extent of phase-in and phase-out 
services required. The plan shall specify a training program and a date 
for transferring responsibilities for each division of work described in 
the plan, and shall be subject to the Contracting Officer's approval. 
The Contractor shall provide sufficient experienced personnel during the 
phase-in and phase-out period to ensure that the services called for by 
this contract are maintained at the required level of proficiency.
    (c) The Contractor shall allow as many personnel as practicable to 
remain on the job to help the successor maintain the continuity and 
consistency of the services required by this contract. The Contractor 
also shall disclose necessary personnel records and

[[Page 543]]

allow the successor to conduct onsite interviews with these employees. 
If selected employees are agreeable to the change, the Contractor shall 
release them at a mutually agreeable date and negotiate transfer of 
their earned fringe benefits to the successor.
    (d) The Contractor shall be reimbursed for all reasonable phase-in, 
phase-out costs (i.e., costs incurred within the agreed period after 
contract termination that result from phase-in and phase-out operations) 
and a risk or service charge not to exceed a pro rata portion of the 
risk or service charge under this contract. The amount of profit shall 
be based upon the accurate and timely processing of benefit claims, the 
volume and validity of complaints received by OPM, the timeliness and 
adequacy of reports on operations, and responsiveness to OPM offices, 
enrollees, beneficiaries, and Congress. In setting the final profit 
figure, obstacles overcome by the Contractor during the phase-in and 
phase-out period will be taken into consideration.

Contracting Officer may at any time, by written order, and without 
notice to the sureties, if any, make changes within the general scope of 
this contract in any one or more of the following:

    (2) Time of performance (i.e.: hours of the day, days of the week, 
etc.).
    (3) Place of performance of the services.
    (b) If any such change causes an increase or decrease in the cost 
of, or the time required for, performance of any part of the work under 
this contract, or the Contractor's liability under this contract, 
whether or not changed by the order, the Contracting Officer shall make 
an equitable adjustment in the contract price, the delivery schedule, or 
both, and shall modify the contract.
    (c) The Contractor must assert its right to an adjustment under this 
clause with 30 days from the date of receipt of the written order. 
However, if the Contracting Officer decides that the facts justify it, 
the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon a proposal submitted 
before final payment of the contract.
    (d) If the Contractor's proposal includes the cost of property made 
obsolete or excess by the change, the Contracting Officer shall have the 
right to prescribe the manner of the disposition of the property.
    (e) Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a dispute under the 
Disputes clause. However, nothing in this clause shall excuse the 
Contractor from proceeding with the contract as changed.
    (f) The Contracting Officer shall not make any changes pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this clause to conform this contract to any amendment 
in the LIFAR before the effective date of the amendment as provided for

in advance of entering into any subcontract or subcontract modification, 
or as otherwise specified by this contract, when the cost of that

trade-off possibilities considered.
    (c) The Contractor shall obtain the Contracting Officer's written 
consent before placing any subcontract for which advance notification is 
required under paragraph (a) of this clause. However, the Contracting

constitute the consent of the Contracting Officer.

notification and consent required by paragraph (a), (b), and (c) of this 
clause where the Contractor and subcontractor submit an application or 
renewal as a contractor team arrangement as defined in FAR subpart 9.6

    (1) The Contracting Officer evaluated the arrangement during 
negotiation of the contract or contract renewal; and

plan's rates that were reviewed and approved by the Contracting Officer

    (e) Unless the consent or approval specifically provides otherwise, 
consent by the Contracting Office to any subcontract shall not 
constitute a determination (1) of the acceptability of any subcontract 
terms or conditions; (2) of the allowability of any cost under this 
contract; or (3) to relieve the Contractor of any responsibility for 
performing this contract.
    (f) No subcontract placed under this contract shall provide for 
payment on a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost basis. Any fee payable under 
cost reimbursement type subcontracts shall not exceed the fee 
limitations in FAR 15.903(d). Any profit or fee payable under a 
subcontract shall be in accordance with the provisions of Section

entitled to reimbursement from the Government.

exercise the clause rights, shall not affect the Contracting Officer's 
right to require the

termination of the subcontract; or increase the obligation of the 
Government beyond what it would have been if the subcontract had 
contained an appropriate clause.

              Subpart 2301.1--Purpose, Authority, Issuance


<R05>
2301.101  Purpose.

    (a) The Social Security Acquisition Regulation (SSAR) is issued to 
establish uniform acquisition policies and procedures for the Social 
Security Administration (SSA) which conform to the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) System.
    (b) The SSAR implements and supplements the FAR. (Implementing 
material expands upon or indicates the manner of compliance with related 
FAR material. Supplementing material refers to policies or procedures 
which have no corresponding counterpart in the FAR.)
    (c) The SSAR contains only formal agency policies and procedures 
which have a significant effect beyond SSA's internal operating 
procedures or which have a significant cost or administrative impact on 
contractors or offerors.


<R05>
2301.103  Authority.

    The SSAR is prescribed under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 301 and 
section 205(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act 
of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 486(c)).


<R05>
2301.104  Applicability.

    The FAR and SSAR apply to all SSA acquisitions as stated in FAR 
1.104. Unless specified otherwise, the FAR and SSAR apply to 
acquisitions within and outside the United States.


<R05>
  2301.105  Issuance.


<R05>
2301.105-1  Publication and code arrangement.

    (a) The SSAR is also published in the same forms as indicated in FAR 
1.105-1(a).
    (b) The SSAR is issued in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) as 
Chapter 23 of Title 48, Social Security Acquisition Regulation (SSAR). 
It may be referenced as ``48 CFR chapter 23.''


<R05>
2301.105-2  Arrangement of regulations.

    (a) General. The SSAR conforms to the FAR with respect to divisional 
arrangements; i.e., subchapters, parts, subparts, sections, subsections, 
and paragraphs.
    (b) Numbering. The FAR System of numbering permits the keying of the 
same or similar subject matter throughout Chapters 1 (FAR) and 23 (SSAR) 
of Title 48, CFR. However, SSA's system varies somewhat from that of the 
FAR numbering scheme, in the numbering to the left of the decimal point. 
Whereas the FAR only identifies the part number of 48 CFR to the left of 
the decimal point, our corresponding reference identifies the chapter as 
well. For example, the FAR paragraph corresponding to this SSAR 
paragraph is numbered 1.105-2(b) where ``1'' is the part number (may be 
one or two digits and is followed by a decimal point), ``1'' (to the 
right of the decimal point) is the subpart number, ``05'' (always two 
digits) is the section number, ``2'' is the subsection number (always 
hyphenated), and ``(b)'' is the paragraph reference. This SSAR reference 
is 2301.105-2(b) where the ``23'' is the chapter number assigned to SSA 
and the ``01'' represents the part number (part numbers will always be 
two digits for agencies implementing the FAR). The remaining numbers to 
the right of the decimal point are identical to and reflect the same 
divisions as in the FAR numbering scheme.

[[Page 549]]

    (c) References and citations. (1) Unless otherwise stated, 
references indicate parts, subparts, sections, subsections, etc., of 
this regulation, the SSAR.
    (2) This regulation shall be referred to as the Social Security 
Acquisition Regulation (SSAR). Any reference may be cited as ``SSAR'' 
followed by the appropriate number. Within the SSAR, the number alone 
will be used.
    (3) Citations of authority shall be incorporated where necessary. 
All FAR reference numbers shall be preceded by ``FAR.''

<R05>
2401.000  Scope of part.

    This part describes the method by which the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development (HUD) implements, supplements and deviates from 
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) through the establishment of 
the HUD Acquisition Regulation (HUDAR), which prescribes the 
Department's procurement policies and procedures under the FAR System.


<R04>
              Subpart 2401.1--Purpose, Authority, Issuance


<R05>
2401.100  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart describes the HUDAR and states its relationship to the 
FAR System. This subpart also provides the explanation of the purpose 
and the authorities under which the HUDAR is issued.


<R05>
2401.101  Purpose.

    The Department of Housing and Urban Development Acquisition 
Regulation is hereby established as chapter 24 of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation System (48 CFR chapter 24). It is issued to 
provide uniform Departmental policies and procedures for the acquisition 
of supplies, personal property and non-personal services by the 
Department's contracting activities and to make these policies and 
procedures readily available to Departmental personnel and to the 
public.


<R05>
2401.103  Authority.

    The HUDAR is prescribed by the Assistant Secretary for 
Administration under section 7(d) of the Department of HUD Act (42 
U.S.C. 3535(d)), section 205(c) of the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 486(c)), the Secretary's 
delegation effective January 19, 1976, 41 FR 2665, and the general 
authorization in FAR 1.301.
[49 FR 7697, Mar. 1, 1984. Redesignated at 61 FR 19470, May 1, 1996]


<R05>
2401.104  Applicability.

    All acquisition of personal property and non-personal services 
(including construction) by HUD, except as may be otherwise authorized 
by law, must be accomplished in accordance with the HUDAR and the FAR.
[49 FR 7697, Mar. 1, 1984. Redesignated at 61 FR 19470, May 1, 1996]

[[Page 554]]


<R05>
2401.105  Issuance.


<R05>
2401.105-2  Arrangement of regulations.

    (a) General. Chapter 24 is divided into parts, subparts, sections, 
subsections, paragraphs and further subdivisions as necessary.
    (b) Numbering. Generally, the numbering system and part, subpart, 
and section titles used in the HUDAR conform with those used in the FAR 
or as follows:
    (1) When the HUDAR implements or deviates from a parallel part, 
subpart, section, subsection, or paragraph of the FAR, that 
implementation or deviation will be numbered and captioned where 
possible to correspond to the FAR part, subpart, section, subsection, or 
paragraph. For example, FAR subpart 1.4, Deviations, is implemented in 
HUD's acquisition regulations at subpart 2401.4, Deviations. (The ``24'' 
in the number indicates what chapter of title 48 contains the HUDAR.)
    (2) When HUD supplements material contained in the FAR, it is given 
a unique number containing the numerals ``70'' or higher. The rest of 
the number will parallel the FAR part, subpart, section, subsection, or 
paragraph it is supplementing. For example, FAR 14.407, Award, does not 
contain a provision for the steps to be taken when only one bid is 
received. The HUDAR provides this information. Since the subject matter 
supplements what is contained in FAR 14.407, the HUDAR section 
supplementing the FAR is numbered 2414.407-70.
    (3) Where material in the FAR requires no implementation or 
deviation, there is no corresponding numbering in the HUDAR. Therefore, 
there may be gaps in the HUDAR sequence of numbers where the FAR, as 
written, is applicable to the HUDAR and requires no further 
implementation.
    (c) Citation. The HUDAR will be cited in accordance with Federal 
Register standards approved for the FAR. Thus, this section when 
referred to in the HUDAR is cited as 2401.104-2(c). When this section is 
referred to formally in official documents, such as legal briefs, it 
should be cited as ``48 CFR 2401.104-2(c).'' Any section of the HUDAR 
may be formally identified by the section number, e.g., ``HUDAR 
2401.104-2.'' In the HUDAR, any reference to the FAR will be indicated 
by ``FAR'' followed by the section number, for example FAR 37.108.
[49 FR 7697, Mar. 1, 1984, as amended at 58 FR 49437, Sept. 23, 1993. 
Redesignated at 61 FR 19470, May 1, 1996]


<R05>
2401.106  OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act.

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520) requires 
that Federal agencies obtain approval from the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) before collecting information from 10 or more persons. HUD 
has received approval from OMB to collect information under the 
provisions of its Acquisition Regulation. The OMB Approval Number is 
2535-0091.
[50 FR 46575, Nov. 8, 1985. Redesignated at 61 FR 19470, May 1, 1996]


<R04>
             Subpart 2401.3--Agency Acquisition Regulations


<R05>
2401.301  Policy.

    (a)(1) Implementation. The HUDAR implements and supplements the FAR. 
Implementation material is that which expands upon related FAR material. 
Supplementing material is that for which there is no counterpart in the 
FAR.


<R05>
2401.302  Limitations.

    (c) Exclusions. Certain HUD policies and procedures which come 
within the scope of this chapter are not included in the HUDAR. Not 
included is a policy or procedure of an internal nature or which is 
expected to be effective for a period of less than six months.


<R04>
                       Subpart 2401.4--Deviations


<R05>
2401.403  Individual deviations.

    In individual cases, proposed deviations from the FAR or HUDAR shall 
be submitted to the Senior Procurement Executive (see 2401.601-70) for 
approval or other necessary or appropriate action. A supporting 
statement shall be submitted with the proposed deviation indicating 
briefly the nature of the deviation and the reasons for granting the 
deviation, consistent with

[[Page 555]]

FAR 1.402. The contract file shall include a copy of the request 
submitted and the approval. In emergency situations involving individual 
cases, deviation approvals may be processed by telephone and later 
confirmed in writing.
[49 FR 7697, Mar. 1, 1984, as amended at 51 FR 7948, Mar. 7, 1986; 53 FR 
46533, Nov. 17, 1988]


<R05>
2401.404  Class deviations.

    For deviations which affect more than one contracting action, 
proposed deviations from the FAR or HUDAR shall be submitted to the 
Senior Procurement Executive for approval or other necessary or 
appropriate action. Requests for deviations shall be supported by 
statements which fully disclose the nature of the deviation and the need 
there of. The Senior Procurement Executive will consider the proposal on 
an expedited basis and in the case of a proposed FAR deviation will 
comply with FAR 1.404.
[49 FR 7697, Mar. 1, 1984, as amended at 51 FR 7948, Mar. 7, 1986]


<R04>
     Subpart 2401.6--Career Development, Contracting Authority, and 
                            Responsibilities


<R05>
2401.601  General.


<R05>
2401.601-70  Senior Procurement Executive.

    The Assistant Secretary for Administration is the Department's 
Senior Procurement Executive and is responsible for all Departmental 
procurement policy, regulations, and procedures, except for internal 
procedures related to procurement transactions conducted by the 
Government National Mortgage Association. The Senior Procurement 
Executive is also responsible for the development of HUD's procurement 
system standards, evaluation of the system in accordance with approved 
criteria, enhancement of career management of the procurement work 
force, and certification to the Secretary that the Department's 
procurement system meets approved criteria.
[57 FR 59787, Dec. 15, 1992]


<R05>
2401.601-71  Office of Procurement and Contracts.

    Except as provided otherwise is this chapter, the Office of 
Procurement and Contracts, in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for 
Administration, is responsible for all Departmental procurement.
[57 FR 59787, Dec. 15, 1992]


<R05>
2401.601-72  Government National Mortgage Association.

    (a) The President, GNMA, may exercise authority under section 306(g) 
of the National Housing Act and 24 CFR part 390 to enter into agreements 
with the issuers of mortgage-backed securities. The FAR and the HUDAR do 
not apply to these transactions, including the assignation of servicing 
requirements to a substitute servicer or issuer in the event of a 
default by, or other termination of, an issuer.
    (b) Sales or guarantees of securities by GNMA are outside the scope 
of this part.
    (c) All contracts that are not within the scope of paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section, and that are for the acquisition of supplies 
and services, shall be awarded in conformance with the FAR and HUDAR 
and, as appropriate, the FIRMR.
[57 FR 59787, Dec. 15, 1992]


<R05>
2401.601-73  Administrative Service Centers.

    Procurement of supplies and services for HUD field components is 
accomplished at the three Administrative Service Centers, each of which 
has a Contracting Division. The ASC Contracting Division Director may 
redelegate contracting authority to qualified personnel within their 
service area jurisdiction, consistent with the Department's published 
delegations of procurement authority and 2401.603.
[60 FR 46154, Sept. 5, 1995]


<R05>
2401.602  Contracting Officers.


<R05>
2401.602-3  Ratification of unauthorized commitments.

    (b)(1) Policy. A request for ratification shall be sent to the 
Contracting Officer through the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA). 
The request

[[Page 556]]

will include an explanation as to the need for the service, the reason 
why normal procurement procedures were not followed, to what extent 
price competition was received or the price otherwise justified, and, 
corrective management actions to avoid ratifications in the future. If 
the justification is adequate, the ratification will be signed by the 
Contracting Officer and forwarded to the HCA or designee for approval.
    (b)(3) The HCA may delegate authority to approve ratifications below 
the simplified acquisition threshold to:
    (i) Contracting division directors (Headquarters); or,
    (ii) Contracting branch chiefs (Field).
    (c)(5) Legal concurrence may be requested if there is a legal issue 
involved, e.g. the propriety of the funding source, appropriateness of 
the expense, etc.

<R05>
2401.603  Selection, appointment and termination of appointment.


<R05>
2401.603-2  Selection.

    In selecting Contracting Officers, the appointing authorities shall 
consider experience, education, training, business acumen, judgment, 
character, reputation and ethics. In the area of experience, education 
and training, the following shall be required unless contracting 
authority is limited to simplified small purchase procedures:
    (a) Experience, for appointment of an individual to a position 
having Contracting Officer authority, shall consist of a minimum of two 
years experience performing contracting, procurement or purchasing 
operations in a government or commercial procurement office. 
Alternatively, where appointment of a Contracting Officer involves a 
specialized procurement field, experience in that field may be 
considered as a criterion for the appointment.
    (b) Educational requirements for an individual in a position having 
Contracting Officer authority shall be, as a minimum, the equivalent of 
a Bachelor's Degree from an accredited college or institution preferably 
with major studies in Business Administration, Law, Accounting or 
related fields. Experience related to the field of procurement involved 
(e.g., supply construction, etc.), gained in a government or 
nongovernment contracting office, may be substituted for educational 
requirements when it is determined in writing and made a part of the 
appointment files (as stipulated in 2401.603-3(b)) that a potential 
appointee is otherwise qualified by virtue of extensive contract-related 
experience or training.
    (c) Training courses as prescribed by the Senior Procurement 
Executive.
    (d) The selection requirements specified in paragraphs (a) through 
(c) of this section are applicable to all full-time permanent (FTP) 
personnel whose primary duties are performed as a Contracting Officer as 
opposed to the individuals who supervise Contracting Officers, or to 
individuals who normally spend less than 10 percent of their time in the 
capacity of a Contracting Officer.
[49 FR 7697, Mar. 1, 1984; 49 FR 10930, Mar. 23, 1984, as amended at 57 
FR 59787, Dec. 15, 1992]


<R05>
2401.603-3  Appointment.

    (a) Appointments below the level of Assistant Secretary shall be 
made in writing by the Head of the Contracting Activity on a 
``Certificate of Appointment,'' SF 1402. Limitations on the scope of the 
authority to be exercised by the Contracting Officer, other than those 
contained in applicable laws and regulations shall be entered on the 
face of the appointment notification.
    (b) Appointing officials will execute a written affirmative 
statement that the individual, placed in the position to commit the 
Government as Contracting Officer, meets the selection criteria of the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation and HUDAR. If a temporary waiver (see 
2401.603-2) is to be granted concerning the training requirements, the 
written statement should include the waiver and the statement that the 
training requirements must be met within 24 months. This statement shall 
be made part of the official personnel file of the Contracting Officer 
or the individual so selected or designated. The designation and 
statement shall be based on the size and complexity of contracts the 
individual will be required to execute and administer, and also shall 
consider any

[[Page 557]]

limitations on the scope of the authority to be exercised.

<R05>
2402.101  Definitions.

    Accounting Office means the Office of Finance and Accounting in 
headquarters or the Field Accounting Divisions in the field.
    Best Value is an approach to source selection that considers the 
appropriate balance of technical merit, management capability, and cost/
price factors in deciding which proposal offers the overall ``best 
value'' to the Government. A best value procurement permits the 
government to award a contract to an offeror with a higher price in 
order to obtain a better technical product or service with a lower risk 
that performance will be unsuccessful. The selection decision may be 
based on a determination of whether to tradeoff paying a higher price to 
obtain the added value of a particular proposal.
    Department--means The Department of Housing and Urban Development, 
which may also be designated as ``HUD''.
    Head of Contracting Activity (HCA) is defined in accordance with the 
FAR. The following HUD officials are designated HCAs:
    (1) Director, Office of Procurement and Contracts, for HUD 
Headquarters procurement;
    (2) The Directors, Administrative Service Center Contracting 
Divisions for field procurement;
    (3) The President, Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), 
for procurement transactions that are conducted by GNMA in accordance 
with 2401.601-72(c).
    Legal Counsel means the Office of General Counsel in Headquarters, 
or the cognizant Assistant General Counsel in the field.
    Lowest-Priced Technically Acceptable Proposal is an approach to 
source selection under which all evaluation factors, except price, are 
evaluated on a ``Pass-Fail'' basis. It is used when price will be the 
deciding factor once the technical acceptability of proposals has been 
determined.
    Primary Organization Heads are those officials of the Department who 
are responsible for the major organizational components of HUD and who 
report directly to the Secretary or Deputy Secretary. The Primary 
Organization Heads of HUD include: the Assistant Secretaries, the 
Inspector General, and the General Counsel.
    Secretary--means the Secretary of the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development, or his or her designee.
    Senior Procurement Executive--means the Assistant Secretary for 
Administration. The Senior Procurement Executive's responsibilities are 
stated in HUDAR 2401.601-70.
    Source Selection Official means the head of the office initiating 
and providing funding for the procurement, or his/her designee. This 
role may also be delegated to the contracting officer.

<R05>
2409.500  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes responsibilities, general rules, and 
procedures for identifying, evaluating, and resolving organizational 
conflicts of interest.


<R05>
2409.502  Applicability.

    The procedures described in this section shall be used for all 
advisory and assistance services contracts and for any other procurement 
involving the acquisition of services when the Contracting Officer 
determines that the nature of the procurement presents a potential for 
an organizational conflict of interest.
[49 FR 7701, Mar. 1, 1984, as amended at 57 FR 59788, Dec. 15, 1992]


<R05>
2409.503  Waiver.

    The Senior Procurement Executive is authorized to waive any general 
rule or procedure in FAR Subpart 9.5 by determining that its application 
to a particular situation would not be in the Government's interest.
[57 FR 59788, Dec. 15, 1992]


<R05>
2409.504  Contracting officer responsibilities.

    The following actions are required for all contract actions covered 
by 2409.502:
    (a) Disclosure or Representation. (1) Each solicitation shall 
contain a provision which requires a potential offeror to provide a 
statement which describes in a concise manner all relevant facts 
concerning any present or current planned interest (financial, 
contractual, organizational, or otherwise) relating to the work to be 
performed under this section and bearing on whether the offeror and any 
proposed subcontractor or consultant has a possible organizational 
conflict of interest with respect to:
    (i) Being able to render impartial, technically sound, and objective 
assistance or advice; or
    (ii) Being given an unfair competitive advantage.

The offeror also may provide relevant facts that show how its 
organizational structure or management systems limit its knowledge of 
possible organizational conflicts of interest relating to other 
divisions or sections of the organizations and how that structure or 
system would eliminate or neutralize such organizational conflict.
    (2) In the absence of any interest referred to above, the offeror 
shall submit a statement certifying that to the best of its knowledge 
and belief no such interest exists.
    (3) The Contracting Officer will review the statement submitted and 
may

[[Page 562]]

require additional relevant information from the offeror. All such 
information and any other relevant information known to the Contracting 
Officer will be used to determine whether an award to the offeror may 
create any organizational conflict of interest. If such organizational 
conflict of interest is found to exist, the Contracting Officer may:
    (i) Impose appropriate conditions which eliminate or neutralize such 
conflict;
    (ii) Disqualify the offeror; or,
    (iii) Determine that it is otherwise in the best interests of the 
United States to contract with the offeror by including appropriate 
conditions mitigating such conflict in the contract awarded.
    (4) Failure to provide the disclosure or execute the representation 
will be deemed to be a minor infraction and the offeror or contractor 
will be permitted to correct the omission within a time frame 
established by the Contracting Officer.
    (5) Refusal to provide the disclosure or representation and any 
additional information as required, or the willful nondisclosure or 
misrepresentation of any relevant interest shall disqualify the offeror 
or contractor for award or provide the rationale for post-award default 
action if the exercise of due diligence would have disclosed an apparent 
conflict. This provision applies equally to post-award disclosure 
requirements contained in the clause required by HUDAR 2409.508-2.
    (b) Administrative requirements. (1) The disclosure or certification 
required by HUDAR 2409.508-1 and 2409.508-2 is designed to alert the 
Contracting Officer to situations or relationships which may constitute 
either present or anticipated organizational conflicts of interest with 
respect to a particular offeror or contractor. However, this disclosure 
or representation may not identify a potential organizational conflict 
of interest involving a successful offeror that could affect his or her 
participation in subsequent procurements arising out of or related to 
work performed under a contract that results from the solicitation 
currently under consideration. Accordingly, whenever such potential 
conflicts are foreseeable, a special notice also shall be included in 
the solicitation informing offerors of the fact that such a potential 
conflict is foreseen and that a special contract clause designed to 
eliminate or neutralize such conflict will be included in any resultant 
contract. Such notice shall specify the proposed extent and duration of 
restrictions to be imposed with respect to participation in subsequent 
procurements. A fixed term of reasonable duration is measured by the 
time required to eliminate what otherwise would constitute an unfair 
competitive advantage. This is a variable. However, in no event shall an 
exclusion be stated which is not related to a specific expiration date 
or a certain event. The Government shall not determine without notice on 
an after-the-fact basis that performance of a contract created an 
organizational conflict of interest with respect to procurements arising 
out of or related to work performed under that contract.
    (2) Whenever an organizational conflict of interest is found to 
exist, it shall be adequately eliminated, or neutralized through the use 
of an appropriate special contract clause. Examples of the types of 
clauses which may be employed include, but are not limited, to the 
following:
    (i) Hardware exclusion clauses which prohibit the acceptance of 
production contracts following a related nonproduction contract 
previously performed by the Contractor.
    (ii) Software exclusion clauses which:
    (A) Require the contractor, members of his or her Board of 
Directors, or his or her chief executives to eliminate, or neutralize an 
organizational conflict of interest:
    (B) Provide for the protection of the confidentiality of data and 
guard against its unauthorized use; or
    (C) Prohibit other segments or divisions of the contractor from 
becoming involved in the performance of the contract work or being in a 
position to influence such work.
    (iii) The prospective contractor shall be given the opportunity to 
negotiate the terms and conditions of the clause and its application. 
The extent and time period of any restrictions shall be specified in the 
clause.

[[Page 563]]

    (c) Contract award when an organizational conflict of interest is 
present. (1) No contract or modification award shall be made to an 
offeror or contractor having an organizational conflict of interest with 
respect to that contract or modifications unless:
    (i) The conflict has been eliminated or neutralized; or
    (ii) The Contracting Officer determines that the award of the 
contract would be otherwise in the best interests of the Government. 
Where such a determination is made, an appropriate written finding and 
determination shall be placed in the contract file.
    (2) Examples of circumstances justifying such a determination 
include but are not necessarily limited to:
    (i) Situations where the public exigency will not otherwise permit; 
or,
    (ii) Situations where the requirement cannot otherwise be obtained.
    (3) The Contracting Officer's determination shall be approved by the 
Head of the Contracting Activity before award.
    (d) Action in Lieu of Termination. If the Contracting Officer 
determines that it would not be in the best interest of the Government 
to terminate a contract as provided in the clause cited at HUDAR 
2409.508-2, the Contracting Officer shall take every reasonable action 
to eliminate, or otherwise neutralize the organizational conflict of 
interest.

2415.407  Solicitation provisions.

    (a) The Contracting Officer shall insert a provision substantially 
the same as the provision at 48 CFR 2452.215-70, Proposal Content, in 
all solicitations for negotiated procurements using the best value 
approach selection method

[[Page 566]]

expected to exceed the simplified acquisition limit. The Contracting 
officer shall adapt paragraph (c) of the provision (i.e., include, 
delete, and provide additional detail to subparagraphs) to address the 
particular requirements of the immediate solicitation. The provision may 
be used in simplified acquisitions when it is necessary to obtain 
technical and management information in making the award selection. When 
award selection will be made through the lowest-priced technically 
acceptable proposal method, the provision shall be used with its 
Alternate I. If the proposed contract requires work on, or access to, 
sensitive automated systems as required by the clause at 48 CFR 
2452.237-76, the provision shall be used with its Alternate II.

<R05>
2415.413  Disclosure and use of information before award.


<R05>
2415.413-1  Alternate I.

    It is HUD's policy to have proposals evaluated by the most competent 
technical and management sources available. The Department's preferred 
procedure for evaluation of proposals is not to disclose the proposals 
outside the Government for evaluation purposes. If external parties will 
not be used to evaluate proposals, the procedures in FAR 15.413-1 
Alternate I, shall be used.
[61 FR 19471, May 1, 1996]


<R05>
2415.413-2  Alternate II.

    When it is necessary to disclose proposals outside the Government to 
meet the Department's evaluation needs, the procedures in FAR 15.413-2 
Alternate II, shall be used.
    (f)(1) The HCA is authorized to make decisions regarding the release 
of proposals outside the Government.
    (2) The written agreement shall be obtained prior to releasing 
proposals to the evaluator.
    (3) The HCA shall make the written determination, which shall be 
retained permanently in the official contract file.

<R05>
2415.505  Content of unsolicited proposals.


<R05>
2415.505-70  Unsolicited research proposals.

    FAR subpart 15.5 outlines the policies and procedures relating to 
unsolicited proposals. In addition to these requirements, the Department 
requires that each award made as the result of an unsolicited proposal 
for research contain a commitment to provide actual cost-sharing. This 
provision will be included in the award whether or not cost-sharing was 
part of the unsolicited proposal.


<R05>
2415.506  Agency procedures.

    (a) The contact points shall ensure that unsolicited proposals are 
controlled, evaluated, safeguarded, and disposed of in accordance with 
FAR subpart 15.5.
    (b) Unless otherwise specified in a Federal Register announcement 
unsolicited proposals should be submitted to the following contact 
points:
    (1) For research-- Department of Housing and Urban Development, 
Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research, Office of 
Management and Program Control, 451 7th Street SW., Washington, DC 
20410.
    (2) For funding under the Secretary's Discretionary Fund Program--
Department of Housing and Urban Development, Assistant Secretary for 
Community Planning and Development, Office of Program Policy 
Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410.
    (3) For all others-- Department of Housing and Urban Development, 
Director, Office of Procurement and Contracts, 451 7th Street SW.,

[[Page 567]]


<R05>
2415.604  Responsibilities.

    (b) The technical requirements related to source selection shall be 
performed by a Technical Evaluation Panel (TEP). Generally, a TEP will 
consist of three to five voting members, with one member serving as the 
chairperson. For more complex procurements, the TEP may add advisors 
and/or a committee structure to focus on specific technical issues or 
concerns. For inexpensive or routine acquisitions of equipment, supplies 
or services, the TEP may consist of one technical representative. The 
TEP is responsible for documenting the evaluation of all proposals as 
appropriate to the source selection approach in use, and for making the 
source selection recommendation(s).
    (c)(4) The selection of the source(s) for contract award shall be 
made by:
    (i) The contracting officer for awards using the ``lowest-priced 
technically-acceptable proposal'' approach; or,
    (ii) The Source Selection Official (SSO) for awards based on the 
``best value'' approach.
[60 FR 46156, Sept. 5, 1995]


<R05>
2415.605  Evaluation factors.

    (d)(1) The solicitation shall state the basis for the source 
selection decision as either ``lowest-priced technically-acceptable 
proposal'' (LPTAP) or ``best value'' (see 2402.1, Definitions).
    (2) When using the best value approach, each technical evaluation 
factor and subfactor shall be assigned a numerical weight (except for 
pass-fail factors) which shall appear in the RFP. When using LPTAP, each 
evaluation factor is applied on a ``pass-fail'' basis; numerical scores 
are not assigned. ``Pass-Fail'' evaluation factors define a standard of 
comparison for solicitation/contract requirements which proposals either 
completely satisfy or fail to meet.
[60 FR 46156, Sept. 5, 1989, as amended at 61 FR 19471, May 1, 1996]


<R05>
2415.608  Proposal evaluation.

    (a) After receipt of proposals, the Contracting Officer will forward 
copies of the technical portion of each proposal to the TEP Chairperson 
or his or her designee. The cost/price portion of each proposal shall be 
retained by the Contracting Officer pending initial technical evaluation 
by the TEP.
    (3) Technical evaluation. The TEP shall rate each proposal based on 
the evaluation factors specified in the solicitation. The TEP shall 
identify each proposal as being either acceptable, unacceptable but 
capable of being made acceptable, or unacceptable. A proposal shall be 
considered unacceptable if it is so clearly deficient that it cannot be 
corrected through written or oral discussions. Under the best value 
approach, predetermined cut-off scores designed to determine a threshold 
level of acceptability of proposals shall not be employed. A technical 
evaluation report, which complies with FAR 15.608(a)(3), shall be 
prepared and signed by the technical evaluator(s), furnished to the 
contracting officer, and maintained as a permanent record in the 
official procurement file.
    (b) The HCA may reject all proposals received in response to a 
solicitation. His or her written determination shall follow FAR 
15.608(b).
[50 FR 46577, Nov. 8, 1985, as amended at 57 FR 59789, Dec. 15, 1992; 60

<R05>
2415.610  Written or oral discussion.

    (b) Except as provided in FAR 15.610(a), the Contracting Officer (or 
his or her designee) and the TEP shall conduct written or oral 
discussions with all responsible offerors who submit proposals within 
the competitive range.


<R05>
2415.611  Best and final offers.

    (d) After receipt and evaluation of best and final offers, the TEP 
shall document its selection recommendation(s) in a final written 
report. The final report shall include sufficient information to support 
the recommendation(s) made, appropriate to the source selection approach 
and type and complexity of the acquisition.
[60 FR 46156, Sept. 5, 1995]


<R05>
2415.613  Alternative source selection procedures.

    (a) The Department of Housing and Urban Development uses procedures 
authorized by FAR 15.613 for all research and development contracts and

[[Page 568]]

other contracts where the contractor's proposed methodology of carrying 
out the work is a significant selection factor and the award decision 
will follow the best value approach.
    (b) These procedures allow for limited oral or written discussions 
to avoid technical leveling, a request for best and final offers, and 
selection of source(s) for negotiation of a final contract.

received in accordance with 2415.608.
[60 FR 46156, Sept. 5, 1995]


<R05>
2415.613-71  Limited written or oral discussions.

    Limited written or oral discussions shall be conducted with each 
offeror considered to be within the competitive range. These discussions 
should address technical weaknesses of the particular offer, as well as 
cost issues, to the fullest extent practicable while avoiding technical 
leveling.
[57 FR 59789, Dec. 15, 1992]


<R05>
2415.613-72  Selection and final negotiation.

    (a) Selection. After the close of discussions and receipt of best 
and final offers, the TEP shall perform a final evaluation and prepare 
its selection recommendation for the SSO. Based on this evaluation, the 
SSO shall select for final contract negotiation the offeror(s) whose 
proposal is most advantageous to the Government in terms of price/cost, 
technical and other relevant factors included in the solicitation.
    (b) Final negotiation. This includes reaching agreement with the 
selected source on any remaining cost/price, technical, socioeconomic, 
or other issues that will condition performance of the contract and 
setting forth those terms and conditions in a mutually acceptable 
contract document. No factor or condition that could have had any effect 
on the selection process may be changed at this point. These 
negotiations are led by the contracting officer and may include any 
technical, audit, or support personnel he/she deems necessary.

    It is the policy of the Department to foster and promote Minority 
Business Enterprise (MBE) participation in its procurement program, to 
the extent permitted by law and consistent with its primary mission. A 
``minority business enterprise'' is a business which is at least 51 
percent owned by one or more minority group members; or, in the case of 
a publicly-owned business, one in which at least 51 percent of its 
voting stock is owned by one or more minority group members, and whose 
management and daily business operations are controlled by one or more 
such individuals. For this purpose, minority group members are those 
groups of U.S. citizens found to be disadvantaged by the Small Business 
Administration pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act.

any tax. When a problem exists, the Contracting Officer shall request, 
in writing, the assistance of legal counsel. The request shall detail 
the problem and be accompanied by appropriate backup data. Counsel shall 
report to the Contracting Officer as to the necessary disposition of the 
tax problem. The Contracting Officer will notify the contractor of the 
outcome of the tax problem. Counsel is responsible for communications 
with the Department of Justice for representation or intervention in 
proceedings concerning taxes.

    (a) It is the Department of Housing and Urban Development's policy 
to avoid situations which place an offeror in a position where its 
judgment may be biased because of any past, present, or currently 
planned interest, financial or otherwise, that the offeror may have 
which relates to the work to be performed pursuant to this solicitation 
or where the offeror's performance of such work may provide it with an 
unfair competitive advantage.
    (b) Offerors shall provide a statement which describes in a concise 
manner all relevant facts concerning any past, present, or currently 
planned interest (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) 
relating to the work to be performed hereunder and bearing on whether 
the offeror has a possible organizational conflict of interest with 
respect to (1) being able to render impartial, technically sound, and 
objective assistance or advice, or (2) being given an unfair competitive 
advantage. The offeror may also provide relevant facts that show how its 
organizational structure and/or management systems limit its knowledge 
of possible organizational conflicts of interest relating to other 
divisions or sections of the organization and how that structure or 
system would avoid or mitigate such organizational conflict. (Offerors 
should refer to FAR subpart 9.5 and HUDAR subpart 2409.5 for policies 
and procedures for avoiding, neutralizing, or mitigating organizational 
conflicts of interest).
    (c) In the absence of any relevant interests referred to above, the 
offeror shall complete the certification at 2452.209-71, Organizational 
Conflicts of Interest Certification.
    (d) No award shall be made until the disclosure or certification has 
been evaluated by the Contracting Officer. Failure to provide the 
disclosure or certification will be deemed to be a minor infraction and 
the offeror will be permitted to correct the omission within a time 
frame established by the Contracting Officer.
    (e) Refusal to provide the disclosure or certification and any 
additional information as required, or the willful nondisclosure or 
misrepresentation of any relevant information shall disqualify the 
offeror.
    (f) If the Contracting Officer determines that a potential conflict 
exists, the selected offeror shall not receive an award unless the 
conflict can be avoided or otherwise resolved through the inclusion of a 
special contract clause or other appropriate means. The terms of any 
special clause are subject to negotiation.

    As prescribed in 2424.202-70, insert the following provision in all 
solicitations.

           Freedom of Information Act Notification (Apr 1984)

    Proposals submitted in response to this solicitation are subject to 
disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). To assist the 
Department in determining whether or not to release information 
contained in a proposal in the event a FOIA request is received, 
offerors may, through clear earmarking or otherwise, indicate those 
portions of their proposals which they believe should not be disclosed. 
While an offeror's advice will be considered by the Department in its 
determination whether to release requested

[[Page 586]]

information or not, it must be emphasized that the Department is 
required by the FOIA to make an independent evaluation as to the 
information, notwithstanding the offeror's views. It is suggested that 
if an offeror believes that confidential treatment is appropriate, the 
basis for this view should be provided, where possible, because general 
assertions or blanket requests for confidentiality, without more 
information, are not particularly helpful to the Department in making 
determinations concerning the release of information under the Act. It 
should also be noted that the Department is required to segregate 
disclosable information from non-disclosable items, so particular care 
should be taken in the identification of each portion of which 
confidential treatment is requested. Offeror's views concerning 
confidentiality will be used to aid the Department in preparing its 
response to FOIA requests. Further, offerors should note that the 
presence or absence of such comments or earmarking regarding 
confidential information will have no bearing whatsoever on the 
evaluation of proposals submitted pursuant to this solicitation, nor 
will the absence of this earmarking automatically result in greater 
disclosure.

employee has received a timely appropriate background investigation.
    Upon completion of the investigation process, the Contracting 
Officer, after conferring with the appropriate HUD offices, shall notify 
the contractor in writing of the individual's eligibility or 
ineligibility to work on this contract. The contractor is responsible

this contract sign a pledge of nondisclosure of information. These 
pledges shall be signed by the employees before they are assigned to 
this contract and shall be maintained by the contractor for a period of 
three years after final payment under the contract.
    (e) Nondisclosure of information. Neither the contractor nor any of 
its employees shall divulge or release data or information developed or 
obtained during performance of this contract, except to authorized 
Government personnel with an established need to know or upon written 
approval of the Contracting Officer. Information contained in all source 
documents and other media provided by HUD are the sole property of HUD.
    (f) Contract performance. If HUD receives disqualifying information 
on a contractor employee, the contractor, upon written notice, will 
immediately remove the employee

[[Page 590]]

from work on this contract. Contractor employees may be barred from 
working on this contract for failing to meet or maintain the suitability 
standards prescribed in FPM Chapter 731, as applicable. Failure to 
comply with the terms of this clause may result in termination for 
default.
    (g) Notification. The contractor shall notify the Government 
Technical Representative (GTR) in writing (with a copy to the 
contracting officer) whenever a cleared employee terminates employment 
or is no longer working on this contract, and the GTR shall notify the 
HUD ADP Security Staff, who will notify the OIG Security Staff. The 
contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer of any 
breach or suspected breach of security or any unauthorized disclosure of 
the information contained in the automated system specified in this 
contract.

cause for additional period of performance or entitlement to 
compensation except as set forth in the contract. If the contractor's 
personnel work on a holiday, no form of holiday or other premium 
compensation will be reimbursed either as a direct or indirect cost, 
unless authorized pursuant to an overtime clause elsewhere in this 
contract.
    (c) When HUD grants administrative leave to its Government 
employees, assigned contractor personnel in Government facilities shall 
also be dismissed. However, the contractor agrees to continue to provide 
sufficient personnel to perform round-the-clock requirements of critical 
tasks already in operation or scheduled, and shall be guided by the 
instructions issued by the Contracting Officer or his/her duly 
authorized representative.
    (d) For fixed-price contracts, if services are not required or 
provided because the building is closed due to inclement weather, 
unanticipated holidays declared by the President, failure of the 
Congress to appropriate funds, or similar reasons, deductions will be 
computed as follows:
    (1) The deduction rate in dollars per day will be equal to the per 
month contract price divided by 21 days per month.
    (2) The deduction rate in dollars per day will be multiplied by the 
number of days services are not required or provided.
    If services are provided for portions of days, appropriate 
adjustment will be made by the Contracting Officer to ensure that the 
contractor is compensated for services provided.
    (e) If administrative leave is granted to contractor personnel as a 
result of conditions stipulated in any ``Excusable Delays'' clause of 
this contract, it will be without loss to the contractor. The cost of 
salaries and wages to the contractor for the period of any such excused 
absence shall be a reimbursable item of direct cost hereunder for 
employees whose regular time is normally charged, and a reimbursable 
item of indirect cost for employees whose time is normally charged 
indirectly in accordance with the contractor's accounting policy.

    The Contractor shall provide to the GTR and Contracting Officer a 
project management system workplan and regular status reports showing 
actual progress against the workplan. The project management system 
utilizes two reporting forms (the HUD 441.1 Baseline Plan and the HUD

the workplan and progress reports shall consist of the following:

                                Workplan

    The workplan shall consist of a narrative description and a graphic 
summary (HUD 441.1) of the schedule and financial elements of the 
contract. The narrative shall: (1) describe the planned schedule; (2) 
identify each step in the work process required for completing the 
contract work and the period of time needed to accomplish each step, 
expressed in terms of calendar dates; (3) provide the staff, financial, 
and other resources allocated to each task; and, (4) provide the 
rationale for project organization, staff utilization, and other 
resources allocated to each task or activity. The HUD 441.1 shall show: 
(1) cumulative planned or budgeted costs of work scheduled for each 
reporting period over the life of the contract; and (2) the planned 
project schedule that traces, by reporting period, the task or sub-task 
start dates, periods of work in progress, and completion dates.

                            Progress Reports

    Progress reports shall consist of a narrative report and the HUD 
661.1 which depicts actual progress against planned progress. The 
narrative report shall: (1) provide a brief, factual summary description 
of technical progress made and costs incurred for each task (or group of 
tasks) during the reporting period; and, (2) identify significant 
problems and their impacts, causes, proposed corrective actions, and the 
effect that such corrective actions will have on the accomplishment of 
the contract objectives. The HUD 661.1 reproduces the Baseline Plan (HUD 
441.1) and shall show: (1) the schedule status or the degree of 
completion of tasks/activities by time intervals; and, (2) cost status 
or the actual costs of work performed in accomplishing the tasks.
    Specific and detailed guidance on preparing the forms and the 
narratives may be obtained from the GTR.

Contractor shall, to the maximum extent practical, utilize the travel 
discounts offered to Federal travelers, through use of contracted 
airline discount air fares, hotel and motel lodging rates, and car 
rental companies, which are available to contractor employees performing

which are determined by the NSF contracting officer to be ``necessary to 
carry out the purposes of the NSF Act,'' then 41 U.S.C. 252(c)(15) is 
applicable and the contract may be entered into through negotiation 
rather than formal advertising. The Foundation's contracting officer 
may, in lieu of reliance on 42 U.S.C. 1870(c) and 41 U.S.C. 252(c)(15), 
utilize other applicable negotiating authorities at his or her 
discretion. 42 U.S.C. 1870(c) and 41 U.S.C. 252(c)(15) may also be used 
to authorize negotiation if the Foundation is carrying out, ``at the 
request of the Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense, specific 
scientific activities in connection with matters relating to 
international cooperation or national security.'' Contracts or their 
modifications entered into under this authority may be done so without 
legal consideration and without performance or other bonds.

governing allocation of rights to inventions made under NSF contracts, 
grants, and cooperative agreements are codified as part 650 of title 45 
of the Code of Federal Regulations.

2527.7002  NSF patent policy.

    As authorized by the National Science Board at its 230th meeting, 
October 15-16, 1981, the Director of the National Science Foundation has 
adopted the following statement of NSF patent policy.
    (a) In accordance with by the Bayh-Dole Act and the Presidential 
Memorandum entitled ``Government Patent Policy'' issued February 18, 
1983, the Foundation will use the Patent Rights clause prescribed by the 
Department of Commerce in all its funding agreements for the performance 
of experimental, developmental, or research work, including awards made 
to foreign entities, unless the Foundation determines that some other 
provision would better serve the purposes of that Act or the interests 
of the United States and the general public.
    (b) In funding agreements covered by a treaty or agreement that 
provides that an international organization or foreign government, 
research institute, or inventor will own or share patent rights, the 
Foundation will acquire such patent rights as are necessary to comply 
with the applicable treaty or agreement.
    (c) If an awardee elects not to retain rights to an invention, the 
Foundation will allow the inventor to retain the principal patent rights 
unless the awardee, or the inventor's employer if other than the 
awardee, shows that it would be harmed by that action.
    (d) The Foundation will normally allow any patent rights not wanted 
by the awardee or inventor to be dedicated to the public through 
publication in scientific journals or as a statutory invention 
registration. However, if another Federal agency is known to be 
interested in the relevant technology, the Foundation may give it an 
opportunity to review and patent the invention so long as that does not 
inhibit the dissemination of the research results to the scientific 
community.

payments, and (b) such advance payment is appropriate in order to 
contract for the required work.

              Subpart 2801.1--Purpose, Authority, Issuance


<R05>
2801.101  Purpose.

    The JAR is established to provide procurement regulations that 
supplement the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR), chapter 1). As such, the regulations contained in the 
JAR will include coverage of only those areas where agency 
implementation is required by the FAR, or where Department of Justice 
policies and procedures exist that supplement FAR coverage and directly 
affect the contractual relationship between the Department and potential 
or existing contractors. The JAR will not repeat or supplement FAR 
coverage where considered unnecessary. The JAR is not a complete system 
of regulations and must be used in conjunction with the FAR.

    Source: 57 FR 24555, June 10, 1992, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
2801.270  Amendment of regulation.

    This Regulation will be amended from time to time to set forth 
improved procedures which reduce contract preparation time, simplify and 
standardize contract forms, improve the contracting process and reflect 
changes in statutes, Executive Orders, the FAR and other policies. 
Acquisition personnel are encouraged to submit suggestions, based on 
operating experience, for improving and simplifying the procedures set 
forth in this Regulation. Such suggestions should be submitted through 
the Bureau Chief of Procurement to the Office of the Procurement 
Executive.


<R05>
2801.270-1  Revisions.

    This Regulation will be amended by issuance of Justice Acquisition 
Circulars (JACs) containing loose-leaf replacement pages which revise 
parts, subparts, paragraphs or subparagraphs.

[[Page 606]]

A vertical bar (edit bar) at the beginning or end of a line indicates 
that a change has been made within that line.


<R05>
2801.270-3  Effective date.

    (a) Statements in Justice Acquisition Circulars and Policy 
Directives to the effect that the material published therein is 
``effective upon receipt,'' or upon a specified date, or that changes 
set forth in the Circulars or Directives are ``to be used upon 
receipt,'' mean that any new or revised clauses or forms included in the 
Circulars or Directives shall be included in invitations for bids and 
requests for proposals issued thereafter.
    (b) Procurements initiated after receipt of new or revised clauses 
should include such clauses.
    (c) Unless otherwise stated, invitations for bids which have been 
issued and bilateral agreements, upon which negotiations have been 
completed prior to the receipt of new or revised contract clauses, need 
not be amended to include the new or revised clauses, if such amendment 
would unduly delay the procurement action.


<R05>
2801.270-4  Numbering.

    Justice Acquisition Circulars will be consecutively numbered 
beginning with the number 1, after each rewrite and publication of the 
Justice Acquisition Regulations.

<R04>
             Subpart 2801.3--Agency Acquisition Regulations


<R05>
2801.301  Policy.

    (a) In accordance with FAR 1.301(b) and paragraph (c) of this 
section, the Department may issue acquisition regulations that 
supplement or implement the FAR.
    (b) Subject to the authority in paragraph (c) of this section, the 
Department may also issue internal policies and procedures for the 
efficient administration of its procurement programs and to meet the 
specific needs of the agency.
    (c) Regulations and internal policies and procedures under the JAR 
are issued in accordance with the lawful authority vested in the 
Attorney General. Authority to issue department wide acquisition 
regulations has been delegated by Attorney General Order 1085-85 to the 
Office of the Procurement Executive, subject to the review of the 
Assistant Attorney General of Administration (AAG/A).
    (d) The JAR consists of: (1) Department wide regulations which 
supplement or implement the FAR and which directly affect the 
contractual relationship between the Department's existing or potential 
contractors;
    (2) Published and codified bureau regulations which supplement and 
implement the FAR and directly affect the contractual relationship;
    (3) Published internally but not codified department wide policies 
and procedures which provide administrative guidance in the acquisition 
process in accordance with FAR 1.301(b); and
    (4) Published internally but not codified bureau internal policies 
and procedures which provide administrative guidance in the acquisition 
process in accordance with FAR 1.301(b).

FR 49665, Dec. 9, 1988]


<R05>
2801.303  Codification and public participation.

    (a) Implementing and supplemental regulations issued under the JAR 
are codified under chapter 28 of title 48 of the CFR and conform to the 
numbering system specified in FAR 1.303.
    (b) Department wide regulations (see 2801.301(d)(1)) for which there 
is a FAR counterpart or assigned part, subpart, section, or subsection 
numbers 2801 through 2869. Department wide material for which there is 
no FAR counterpart shall be codified using part, subpart, section, or 
subsection numbers 70 through 79. For example, the Department of Justice 
(DOJ) assigned chapter number in title 48 is 28, part 2870, subpart 
2801.70, section 2801.370, or subsection 2801.370-70.
    (c) Bureauwide regulations (see 2801.301(d)(2)) are assigned parts 
2880 through 2899 under 48 CFR as follows:

2880--2881 Justice Management Division
2882--2883 Drug Enforcement Administration
2884--2885 Federal Bureau of Investigation
2886--2887 Federal Prison Industries
2888--2889 Office of Justice Programs

[[Page 607]]

2890--2891 U.S. Marshals Service
2892--2893 Immigration and Naturalization Service
2894--2895 Bureau of Prisons
2896--2899 [Reserved]

    (d) Public participation in the development of the JAR, including 
subsequent significant amendments or revision, shall be provided by a 
notice in the Federal Register. Normally, at least 60 days will be 
provided for comments. In the event of urgency, regulations may be 
published in final form without an initial comment period. Such 
instances will be fully justified in the Federal Register notice and 
give invitation and consideration to comments received after publication 
within the time period specified in the notice.


<R05>
2801.304  Agency control and compliance procedures.

    (a) The AAG/A shall review and approve all department wide and 
bureauwide acquisition regulations prior to publication in the Federal 
Register to insure compliance with departmental policy and consistency 
with the FAR.
    (b) The Procurement Executive will review all bureau unpublished 
internal acquisition policies and provide comments prior to their 
implementation.

                   the Justice Acquisition Regulations


<R05>
2801.403  Individual deviations.

    Individual deviations from the FAR or the JAR shall be approved by 
the head of the contracting activity (HCA). A copy of the deviation 
shall be included in the contract file. Copies of all deviations will be 
provided to the Procurement Executive.
[60 FR 40108, Aug. 7, 1995]


<R05>
2801.404  Class deviations.

    Requests for class deviations from the FAR or the JAR shall be 
submitted to the Procurement Executive. The Procurement Executive will 
consult with the chairperson of the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council, 
as appropriate, and send his recommendations to the Assistant Attorney 
General for Administration. The Assistant Attorney General for 
Administration will grant or deny requests for such deviations. For the 
purposes of this regulation, requests for deviations involving basic 
ordering agreements, master type contracts or situations where multiple 
awards are made on one solicitation are considered to involve more than 
one contract and are therefore considered to be class deviation 
requests.
[54 FR 40877, Oct. 4, 1989]


<R05>
2801.470  Requests for class deviations.

    Requests for approval of class deviations to the FAR of the JAR 
shall be forwarded to the Procurement Executive. Such requests will be 
signed by the bureau procurement chief. Requests for class deviations 
shall be submitted as far in advance as the exigencies of the situation 
permit and shall contain sufficient written justification to evaluate 
the request.

vested in the Attorney General with respect to acquisition by lease or 
purchase of any interest in real property has been redelegated to the

whether it carries the power of redelegation and the limits, if any, of 
the redelegation of authority.
    (d) The redelegation of contracting authority directly to specific 
persons without regard for intermediate organizational levels only 
establishes authority to represent the Government in its commercial 
business dealings. It is not intended to affect the organizational 
relationship between the contracting officers and higher administrative 
and supervisory levels in the performance of their duties.
    (e) When exercising delegated contracting officer authority, a 
designated employee shall be identified as the contracting officer and

    (2) For the purposes of this section contractual actions include all 
pre-award, award, and post-award contractual actions above the 
thresholds in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) through (iii) including, but not 
limited to modifications, ratifications, and options, but excluding 
orders from Federal Supply Schedules and orders from Basic Ordering 
Agreements. Review by the Office of the Procurement Executive is 
applicable to all organization elements in the Department, with the 
exception of the FBI as noted in this section. It is the responsibility 
of the FBI's Contract Review Board to ensure that procurement actions 
for goods and services are awarded in conformity with applicable 
statutes, regulations, and procedures. This exemption, however, does not 
exempt the FBI from the review by the Office of the Procurement 
Executive of all real property procurement actions above the thresholds 
cited in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section, or from 
other oversight responsibilities of the Office of the Procurement 
Executive, including Procurement Executive review and approval of 
justifications for other than full and open competition on contracts 
over $10 million.
    (b) Prior to submission to the Procurement Executive, the legal 
officer for each Bureau procurement activity is responsible for 
reviewing and approving all such procurement actions for legal 
sufficiency.
    (c) The AAG/A and/or the Procurement Executive may waive any 
requirements for preaward contract review, except those imposed by 
statute. Requests for waivers shall be submitted to the Procurement 
Executive in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) A request for a waiver must be submitted in writing by the head 
of the contracting activity and include a detailed explanation as to why 
a waiver is required, as well as information explaining reasons why a 
contract or class of contracts cannot be reviewed on a preaward basis. 
Oral waivers may be requested and granted under circumstances of 
compelling urgency, but written documentation of the waiver shall be 
made as soon as time permits. All contract documents that are available 
at the time a waiver request is made must accompany the request for 
review. All available documents will be reviewed to assure that the 
award is legally sufficient prior to the granting of a waiver. A 
postaward review of the completed contract file is required. Waivers 
will not be granted near the end of a fiscal year for the purpose of 
obligating year end funds.
    (e) In accordance with Attorney General Orders 1687-93 and 1688-93, 
the head of a Bureau may appeal a decision of the Procurement Executive 
to the Contract Appeals Panel (Panel), in writing, within 15 calendar 
days after receipt of the decision of the Procurement Executive. The 
Panel shall be composed of the Deputy Attorney General who shall serve 
as chairperson, the Associate Attorney General and the Assistant 
Attorney General for Administration. The Panel shall meet on an ad hoc 
basis as necessary and determined by the chairperson. When appealing a 
decision of the Procurement Executive, the head of the Bureau shall 
follow the procedures described in paragraphs (e) (1) through (4) of 
this section.
    (1) The appeal file shall be submitted through the Office of the 
Procurement Executive (OPE) to the Deputy Attorney General as 
Chairperson of the Contract Appeals Panel. Submission of the appeal 
through the OPE is required so that the Procurement Executive may 
provide a written response to the issues raised in the appeal and, due 
to the ad hoc nature of the Contract Appeals Panel, provide a location 
for the collection and maintenance of appeal documents and files. The 
Procurement Executive shall forward the appeal file to the Chairperson 
within five working days of receipt.
    (2) Content of the appeal file. The appeal file must be complete in 
that it fully addresses the issue(s) being appealed. The file shall 
include a copy of the proposed contract or other award action, documents 
relied upon by the contracting officer in taking the action

[[Page 610]]

under dispute, the Procurement Executive's decision and a statement of 
facts setting forth the basis on which the appeal is made. The statement 
of facts shall cite, where applicable, procurement regulations, 
statutes, or decisions by other authorities, such as GAO decisions, that 
support or form the basis of the appeal. A summary shall be provided 
stating the resolution requested by the Bureau. An original and three 
copies of the appeal file shall be submitted.
    (3) The head of the Bureau shall also submit to the OPE, with the 
appeal file, the original contract file as submitted to the OPE for 
review.
    (4) The Contract Appeals Panel, following review and consideration 
of the appeal shall issue its decision in writing to the head of the 
Bureau through the Office of the Procurement Executive and return, with 
the decision, all documents submitted by the Bureau. Unless the Attorney 
General directs that the matter be referred to him/her, the decision of 
the Panel will be the final Department of Justice position as to whether 
a particular procurement action complies with the applicable statute, 
regulation, policy or procedure.

2801.670  Department of Justice Procurement Career Management Program.

    (a) Each Bureau Procurement Chief shall develop a procurement career 
management program for contracting personnel in his or her component.
    (b) The program shall cover all contracting personnel with less than 
seven year experience in the categories described below:
    (1) Occupational series 1102;
    (2) Contracting officers with contracting authority above the 
simplified acquisition threshold;
    (3) Occupational series 1105, other individuals performing 
purchasing duties and individuals with contracting authority at or under 
the simplified acquisition threshold.
    (c)(1) The program shall include:
    (i) An individual assessment by a supervisor of each covered 
employee's state of competence to perform the full range of potential 
duties of his or his job; and
    (ii) An individual development plan to schedule classroom, on-the-
job training, or other training to develop the employee's skill level to 
an appropriate level in each area of competence necessary to perform his 
or her job.
    (2) Individual assessments and development plans should be designed 
to fit the needs of the component, but they should build upon the units 
of competence and instruction prepared by the Federal Acquisition 
Institute wherever feasible. Individual development plans should attempt 
to bring the employee to an appropriate level of skill in all necessary 
competencies by the time the employee has obtained seven years of 
experience in the field of procurement. In general, a proficiency skill 
level of 3, as defined in Attachment 1 to OFPP Policy Letter 92-3, shall 
be attained for any contracting duty that is actually required to be 
performed on the job.
    (3) Employees who perform only purchasing duties, regardless of 
occupational series, shall be required to obtain the requisite level of 
skill only in competencies involving small purchases. If the employee's 
duties are expanded to include contracting duties, then skill in 
procurement competencies must be assessed and developed.
    (4) Individual assessments of covered employee skills shall be 
completed by June 27, 1995, or within 90 days of the employee's entry on 
duty.

<R05>
2801.7001-702  Selection, appointment, limitation of authority.

    (a) COTR Standards Program. This subpart sets forth policies and 
procedures for establishing standards for COTR's in DOJ. The program 
sets forth minimum standards for individuals to be eligible for an 
appointment as a COTR.
    (b) Applicability. The eligibility requirements of this subpart 
apply to all individuals who are designated by the contracting officer 
as COTR's.
    (c) Eligibility standards. To be determined eligible for an 
appointment as a DOJ COTR, the following standards must be met:
    (1) The candidate must attend and successfully complete a minimum of 
a 16-hour basic COTR course;

    (d) Certification and appointment. (1) In accordance with bureau 
procedures, the individual must provide the contracting activity with 
evidence of completion of the COTR course, procurement ethics training, 
and with the certification required by the Procurement Integrity Act. 
Upon determination that the required standards have been met, the chief 
of the contracting office will issue a one-time Certificate of COTR 
Appointment.
    (2) Once the COTR standards have been met and a Certificate of 
Appointment has been issued, an individual may be designated and 
appointed by a contracting officer to serve as a COTR for a particular 
contract. The individual shall be designated in the contract schedule as 
the COTR and shall be notified in writing by the contracting officer of 
the scope and limitations of the COTR's authority as it pertains to the 
particular contract the individual will administer.
    (e) Limitations. Each appointment of a COTR made by the contracting 
officer shall clearly state that the representative is not an authorized 
contracting officer and does not have the authority under any 
circumstances to:
    (1) Award, agree to award, or execute any contract, contract 
modification, notice of intent, or other form of binding agreement;
    (2) Obligate, in any manner, the payment of money by the Government;
    (3) Make a final decision on any contract matter which is subject to 
the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes; or,
    (4) Terminate, suspend, or otherwise interfere with the contractor's 
right to proceed, or direct any changes in the contractor's performance 
that are inconsistent with or materially change the contract 
specifications.
    (f) Termination. Termination of the COTR's appointment shall be made 
in writing by the contracting officer and shall give the effective date 
of the termination. The contracting officer shall promptly modify the 
contract once a COTR termination notice has been issued. A termination 
notice is not required when the COTR's appointment terminates upon 
expiration of the contract.
    (g) Implementation schedule and waivers. No individual may serve as 
a COTR on any contract without the requisite training and signed COTR 
certificate for the file. In the rare event that there is an urgent 
requirement for a specific individual to serve as a COTR and the 
individual has not successfully completed the required training, the 
bureau procurement chief may waive the training requirements and 
authorize the individual to perform the COTR duties, for a period of 
time not to exceed

[[Page 612]]

120 days. The waiver may be granted in accordance with bureau 
procedures.

    (a) If any certification received by, or signed by, the contracting 
officer contains any information of a violation, or possible violation 
of the procurement integrity section of the OFPP Act, the contracting 
officer shall determine whether the reported violation, or possible 
violation has any impact on the pending award, or selection of the 
source thereof. If the contracting officer concludes that there is no 
impact, the contracting officer shall report the violation, accompanied 
by the appropriate documentation supporting that conclusion, to the head 
of the procurement office. With the concurrence of the head of the 
procurement office, the contracting officer may immediately proceed with 
award, and the head of the procurement office shall notify the head of 
the bureau, or his or her designee, of a violation, or possible 
violation.

that the prohibitions of section 27 of the Act have been violated, he/
she shall submit the file to the Procurement Executive with an 
explanation of his/her intentions to remedy the situation. If the 
Procurement Executive concurs in the intended actions, a written 
concurrence will be sent to the head of the bureau or designee. The 
contracting officer will then be advised, or directed by the head of the 
bureau, or designee, as to the action to be taken. The types of actions 
that would normally be taken when a violation has occurred that affected 
the outcome of a procurement are listed in FAR 3.104-11(d).
    (d) If the head of the bureau, or his or her designee, receiving the 
certification of a violation, or possible violation, determines that 
award is justified by urgent and compelling circumstances, or is 
otherwise in the interest of the Government, then he or she may 
authorize the contracting officer to award the contract after 
notification to the Procurement Executive.


<R05>

Policy Letter 81-1, Executive Order 12352, and in compliance with FAR 
7.102, procurement activities of DOJ shall coordinate planning of 
resource utilization in conducting procurement programs. Such planning 
shall accomplish the following objectives:
    (1) Provide for early planning of procurement actions to allow ample 
time for conducting competitive solicitations and to avoid unnecessary 
urgent requirements that generally restrict competition.
    (2) Provide for a more even flow of procurement requests to 
procurement operations throughout a fiscal year, better using personnel 
resources and avoiding wasteful and hasty year-end spending.
    (3) Identify identical or like requirements that can be combined 
under one solicitation, thereby saving manpower resources and financial 
resources through quantity discounts.
    (b) Acquisition planning shall be accomplished in accordance with 
the Department's Advance Procurement Planning Program Order. Approval 
for alterations of programs or DOJ forms must be obtained from the 
Office of the Procurement Executive.

provides that heads of components (Offices, Boards, Divisions and 
Bureaus) shall appoint an acquisition planner for all programs and 
activities requiring contract actions estimated at $500,000 or more in 
any given contract year. Acquisition planners shall be responsible for 
developing and maintaining written advance procurement plans. The 
acquisition planner shall work with the component procurement 
representative in developing advance procurement plans.
    (b) The heads of the contracting activities shall ensure that, 
during the acquisition planning phase, requirements personnel consider 
the use of the metric system of measurement consistent with 15 U.S.C. 
2205 et seq. Use of the metric system must be coordinated with the 
contracting office and be consistent with security, operational, 
economic, technical, training, and safety requirements.

<R05>
2807.7001  Lead times and cut-off dates.

    (a) DOJ procurement activities shall establish lead times and cut-
off dates for acceptance and processing of procurement requests that 
require use of expiring current year funds. Procedures implemented by 
the procurement activities shall include:
    (1) Lead times required to process procurement requests according to 
the method of contracting (sealed bid or competitive proposals, etc.) 
and type of action (new award, modification, or option). Procurement 
activities may further refine the lead times in accordance with their 
experience and types of requirements;
    (2) Firm cut-off dates beyond which a procurement request will not 
be accepted if the requirement is to use expiring current year funds. 
Cut-off dates will be issued consistent with the lead times established 
in paragraph (a)(1) of this section; and
    (3) A statement that failure to submit a requisition prior to the 
cut-off date applicable to processing a fully competitive procurement 
does not, in itself, establish justification for contracting by other 
than full and open competition.
    (b) Fourth quarter procurements.
    (1) Instructions provided to Federal agencies by the Office of 
Management and Budget state that fourth quarter obligations should not 
exceed the average obligations for the first three quarters, except 
where seasonal requirements, essential program objectives, or lead times 
justify a higher level. Excessive and wasteful year-end spending can be 
prevented by firmly enforcing the procurement cut-off dates, the 
Department's Advance Procurement Planning Program Order, reviewing 
questioned procurements with procurement supervisors and appropriate 
program personnel and giving particular attention to fourth quarter 
procurement requests in areas that are particularly vulnerable to 
wasteful spending. In addition, chiefs of the contracting offices shall 
ensure that their staffs are aware of OFPP Policy Letter 81-1 and the 
OFPP checklist for use in detecting and preventing wasteful year-end 
spending.

shown as listed under FAR 9.406-2 (debarment) and FAR 9.407-2 
(suspension).
    (b) Consult the GSA Consolidated List of Debarred, Suspended, or 
Ineligible Contractors prior to soliciting offers from, awarding 
contracts to, renewing or extending contracts, or consenting to 
subcontracts with contractors on the GSA Consolidated List. Exceptions 
will be granted only for compelling reasons and in accordance with FAR 
9.405(a).


<R05>
2809.405  Effects of listing.


<R05>
2809.405-1  Continuation of current contracts.

    In accordance with FAR 9.405-1, contracting activities may continue 
contracts or subcontracts in existence at the time a contractor is 
suspended or debarred unless it is determined that termination of the 
contract is in the best interest of the Government. In making this 
determination contracting activities shall consider the seriousness of 
the act or omission leading to the debarment or suspension, the effect 
of debarment or suspension on the contractor's ability to continue 
operations, and the Department's ability to safeguard its interests and 
receive satisfactory performance and for compelling reasons and in 
accordance with FAR 9.405(a).


<R05>
2809.470  Responsibilities.

    (a) Contracting activities in the OBDBs shall:
    (1) Be familiar with the policies and procedures concerning 
debarment, suspension, and ineligibility as set forth in FAR subpart 9.4 
and this subpart.

[[Page 624]]

    (2) Provide an effective system within their activity to ensure that 
contracting staff consult the GSA Consolidated List of Debarred, 
Suspended, or Ineligible Contractors prior to soliciting offers from, 
awarding or extending contracts to, or consenting to subcontracts with 
contractors on the list.
    (3) Consider recommending debarment or suspension of a contractor 
when cause exists under FAR 9.406-2 (debarment) and FAR 9.407-2 
(suspension). Existence of cause for debarment or suspension does not 
necessarily require that the contractor be debarred or suspended. 
Contracting activities must consider the seriousness of the contractor's 
acts or omissions and any mitigating circumstances. Contracting staffs 
should consult with their appropriate legal counsel prior to making a 
decision to initiate debarment or suspension proceedings. If a 
determination is made that available facts do not justify beginning 
debarment or suspension proceedings, the file should be documented 
accordingly. This determination should be subject to reconsiderations if 
new information or additional fact-finding so justifies.
    (4) Immediately prepare a notice in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(a) 
(debarment) or FAR 9.407-3(c) (suspension) if a decision is made to 
initiate debarment and/or suspension of a contractor. The draft notice 
along with the administrative file containing all relevant facts and 
analysis shall be forwarded to the Procurement Executive, as the 
debarring and suspending official, following review by the activity's 
legal counsel and procurement head.
    (b) The DOJ Procurement Executive, as the debarring and suspending 
official, shall:
    (1) Review the notice and administrative file for sufficiency and 
provide for review by other DOJ officials as considered appropriate.
    (2) Give the contractor prompt notice of the proposed debarment or 
suspension if he or she so decides, in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) 
(debarment) or FAR 9.407-3(c) (suspension).
    (3) Direct additional fact-finding as necessary when material facts 
are in dispute. Fact-finding over disputed issues of fact in debarment 
and suspension proceedings may be conducted by the General Services 
Administration Board of Contract Appeals (GSBCA) in accordance with the 
signed agreement between the Department and GSBCA if requested by either 
the government or the contractor.
    (4) Notify the contractor of the final decision to debar or suspend, 
including a decision not to debar or suspend, in accordance with FAR 
9.406-3(c) (debarment) and FAR 9.407-3(c) (suspension).
    (c) Other responsibilities of the DOJ Procurement Executive.
    (1) Provide notification to GSA within five working days after 
debarring or suspending a contractor or modifying or rescinding such an 
action of the information set forth in FAR 9.404(c).
    (2) Maintain agencywide records of debarred or suspended contractors 
in accordance with FAR 9.404(c)(4).
    (3) In accordance with FAR 9.405(a), approve determinations 
submitted by contracting activities establishing compelling reasons to 
contract or consent to a subcontractor with a contractor on a current 
debarred or suspended list. (DOJ officials do not have the authority to 
make exceptions for contractors declared ineligible.)
    (4) Provide interim notification to the OBDBs of contractors 
debarred or suspended pending inclusion into the GSA Consolidated List 
and coordinate among the OBDBs annual subscriptions to the GSA list.

2810.001  Definitions.

    Dual systems means the use of both inch-pound and metric systems. 
For example, an item is designed, produced, and described in inch-pound 
values with soft metric values also shown for information or comparison 
purposes.
    Hybrid systems means the use of both inch-pound and hard metric 
values in specifications, standards, supplies, and services; e.g., an 
engine with internal parts in metric dimensions and external fittings or 
attachments in inch-pound dimensions.
    Metric system means the International System of Units established by 
the General Conference of Weights and Measures in 1960.
    Soft metric means the result of mathematical conversion of inch-
pound measurements to metric equivalents in specifications, standards, 
supplies, and services. The physical dimensions are not changed.
[57 FR 24558, June 10, 1992]


<R05>
2810.002  Metric Policy.

    Consistent with the policy expressed in FAR 10.002(c), solicitations 
must include specifications and purchase descriptions stated in metric 
units of measurement whenever metric is the accepted industry system. 
Whenever possible, commercially developed metric specifications and 
internationally, or domestically developed voluntary standards, using 
metric measurements, must be adopted. While an industry is in transition 
to metric specifications, solicitations must include specifications and 
purchase descriptions stated in soft metric, hybrid, or dual systems 
except when impractical or inefficient.

<R05>
2810.004-70  ``Brand name or equal'' purchase description.

    (a) A ``brand name or equal'' purchase description shall be used 
only under the conditions listed below and in FAR 10.004(b)(3) and in 
accordance with the policies and procedures in this subpart.
    (1) When a suitable formal Government specification, standard, or 
industry standard approved for agency use is not available and a 
purchase description meeting the general requirements of FAR 10.004 
cannot be prepared because:
    (i) Construction or composition of the product to be procured is too 
technically involved;
    (ii) Public exigency precludes timely development; or,
    (iii) It is impractical or uneconomical to prepare a purchase 
description.
    (2) When purchasing items for authorized resale.
    (b) The term ``brand name product'' means a commercial product 
described by a brand name and make or model number or other appropriate 
nomenclature by which that product is offered for sale to the public by 
the particular manufacturer, producer, or distributor. When using a 
``brand name or equal'' purchase description all known acceptable brand 
name products should be listed in the solicitation. When a ``brand name 
or equal'' purchase description is used to describe a primary item or 
major component, prospective offerors must be given the opportunity to 
offer products other than those specifically referenced by brand name, 
if those other products will meet the needs of the Government in 
essentially the same manner as those referenced as brand name in the 
solicitation. If modifications to standard products are anticipated to 
meet the purchase description requirements, a minimum of 30 calendar 
days shall be allowed between the issuance of the solicitation and the 
opening of bids or receipt of proposals, provided that periods of less 
than 30

[[Page 626]]

calendar days may be set only in cases where one of the statutory 
exceptions to publicizing the procurement in the Commerce Business Daily 
applies and when the contracting officer has reason to believe that 
bidders can bid effectively on the basis of a shorter period.
    (c) ``Brand name or equal'' purchase descriptions should set forth 
those salient physical, functional, or other characteristics of the 
products referenced as brand name which are essential to the Government, 
and should contain the following information to the extent available, 
and include such other information as is necessary to describe the item 
required:
    (1) Complete common generic identification of the required item;
    (2) Applicable make, model, or catalog number for each brand name 
product referenced and identification of the commercial catalog in which 
it appears; and,
    (3) Name of manufacturer, producer, or distributor of each brand 
name product referenced (and address if possible).
    (d) In ``brand name or equal'' solicitations the product referenced 
as ``brand name'' must be regularly offered for sale to the public.
    (e) When a ``brand name or equal'' purchase description is used the 
contracting officer shall note in the contract file the reasons for 
using this purchase description.
    (f)(1) When a ``brand name or equal'' purchase description is used 
in a solicitation, except for component parts or accessories of an end 
item for which the contracting officer determined that the application 
of the following clause would be impractical, the following clause shall 
be inserted after each item so described in the solicitation for 
completion by the offeror.

    Bidding On:
 Manufacturer's Name:___________________________________________________
 Brand:_________________________________________________________________
 No.:___________________________________________________________________

    (2) In addition, the clause set forth in section 2852.210-70 
entitled ``Brand Name or Equal'' shall be inserted into all 
solicitations for which this type of purchase description is used.


<R05>
2810.007  Deviations.

    Heads of contracting activities are authorized to approve deviations 
and exceptions to specifications or standards listed in the Index of 
Federal Specifications and Standards when the exceptions listed in FAR 
10.006 do not apply, in accordance with the reporting and other 
requirements of FAR 10.007. The Office of the Procurement Executive 
shall be notified, in writing, within 30 days of the approval of each 
deviation or exception approved.

<R05>
2812.170  Policy.

    It is the policy of DOJ to ensure that contract delivery schedules 
are reasonable, realistic and meet the requirements of the acquisition. 
However, in some instances when the contractor fails to deliver in a 
timely manner, it may be necessary for the Government to allow the 
contractor to continue performance. Under these circumstances, if the 
delay is caused by conditions which would not be considered ``excusable 
delays'' (as defined in FAR clause 52.249-14, Excusable Delays) the 
contracting officer should secure consideration for the Government's 
forbearance in extending the delivery schedule.

    (a) The Procurement Executive, in accordance with paragraph 1.e., of 
the Procurement Executive Charter, issued with Attorney General Order 
1085-85, is the agency official delegated authority to exercise priority

requested and comply with the requirements of the Defense Priorities and 
Allocations System (OPAS) (15 CFR part 350).
    (2) Upon receipt the Office of the Procurement Executive shall 
review the request for completeness and establish appropriate liaison 
with the Department of Commerce (DOC), the administering agency. 
Depending on the nature of the requirement, the OPE may schedule a 
meeting with DOC officials to present the proposal. In such cases, a 
representative from the requiring activity may be requested to attend.
    (3) DOJ activities requesting rated orders that concern classified 
material shall call the Procurement Executive before submitting their 
request to ensure appropriate transmission and handling between the 
requesting activity and the Office of the Procurement Executive.

    Under limited circumstances as described in this subpart, supplies 
or services directly related to mission accomplishment, may be acquired 
on the open market from local suppliers at the site of the work or use 
point, using vendor's invoices under the certified invoice procedure, 
instead of issuing purchase orders. Certified invoice procedures may not 
be used to place orders under established contracts, unless, specific 
authorization for their use is included in the contract document.

[[Page 629]]


<R05>
2813.7002  Procedure.

    (a) Purchases utilizing the certified invoice procedure shall be 
effected only in accordance with FAR part 13 and JAR 2813, subject to 
the following:
    (1) The amount of any one purchase does not exceed 10 percent of the 
small purchase limitation;
    (2) A purchase order is not required by either the supplier or the 
Government;
    (3) Appropriate invoices can be obtained from the supplier; and
    (4) The items to be purchased shall be domestic source end products, 
except as provided in FAR subpart 25.1.
    (b) Use of the certified invoice procedures does not eliminate the 
requirements in FAR part 13 or JAR part 2813 to:
    (1) Reserve small purchases for small business in accordance with 
the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended (15 U.S.C. 661, et 
seq.), or document the file as to why a small business was not selected;
    (2) Certify that the quality and quantity of item/services furnished 
are in accordance with the verbal agreement made with the vendor; and
    (3) Obtain competitive quotes as is reasonable for the item being 
purchased.
    (c) The Chief of the Contracting Office, as defined in (JAR) 48 CFR 
2802.102(g), shall delegate the authority to the use the certified 
invoice procedure. Each delegation must specify any limitation placed on 
the individual's use of these procedures, such as limits on the amount 
of each purchase, or limits on the commodities, or services which can be 
procured.
    (d) Each individual using this purchasing technique shall require 
the supplier to immediately submit properly prepared invoices which 
itemize property or services furnished. Upon receiving the invoice, the 
individual making the purchase shall annotate the invoice with the date 
of receipt, verify the arithmetic accuracy of the invoiced amount and 
verify on the invoice that the supplies and/or services have been 
received and accepted. If the invoice is correct, the individual making 
the purchase shall sign the invoice indicating acceptance and 
immediately forward it to his/her Executive Office. The invoice shall be 
approved by his/her appropriate administrative office and be forwarded 
to the Finance Office for payment within 5 workdays after receipt of the 
invoice, or acceptance of supplies or services, whichever is later. 
Before forwarding the invoice to Finance, the administrative office 
shall place the following statement on the invoice, along with the 
accounting and appropriation data:

    I certify that these goods and/or services were received on 
____________ (date) and accepted on ____________ (date). Oral purchase

<R05>
2829.303-70  Application of State and local taxes to government contractors and subcontractors.

    (a) It is DOJ policy that DOJ contracts shall not contain clauses 
expressly designating prime contractors as agents of the Government for 
the purpose of avoiding State and local taxes.
    (b) Although circumstances may exist under which a contractor is an 
agent of the Government, even in the absence of a contract clause 
expressly designating a contractor as such, these circumstances should 
be extremely rare. Before any DOJ procuring activity may contend that 
any of its contractors are agents of the Government for the purpose of 
claiming immunity from State and local sales and use taxes, the matter 
will be referred to the AAG/A for review, and approval to ensure that 
DOJ policy is complied with and that the procuring activity's contention 
is fully in accordance with the pertinent legal principles and 
precedents. Each case forwarded will be reviewed by the head of the 
contracting activity before referral to the AAG/A. The referral will 
include all pertinent data on which the procuring activity's contention 
is based, together with a thorough analysis of all relevant legal 
precedents.
    (c) Whenever clauses, procedures, and business practices are cited 
by DOJ procurring activities to support the contention that a contractor 
is an agent of the Government for the purpose of immunity from a State 
or local sales or use tax, contracting activities should whenever 
possible, devise alternative clauses, procedures, and practices for 
future use which will accomplish their intended purpose without 
providing the basis for contention that the contractor is an agent of 
the Government for the purpose of immunity from State and local sales or 
use taxes. Any referral to the AAG/A for approval under this subpart 
shall include comments on the extent to which alternative clauses, 
procedures, or practices may be utilized to accomplish the intended 
purpose without providing the basis for the contention that the 
contractor is an agent of the Government for the purpose of immunity 
from State and local sales or use taxes.

are not authorized to agree to a treatment of costs which would be 
inconsistent with FAR part 31.
    (b) Prior to negotiating an advance agreement, contracting officers 
shall make a written determination setting forth the reasons and 
rationale for entering into such advance agreement. In addition, the 
determination will set forth the nature, the duration, and which 
contract or contracts are covered by the proposed agreement. All 
determinations required by this subpart will be reviewed and approved at 
a level above the contracting officer prior to negotiation of the 
proposed agreement. The approved determination will be placed in the 
contract file.
    (c) All advance agreements shall be in writing and shall set forth 
the nature, duration, and contract or contracts covered by the 
agreements. Advance agreements will be signed by both the contractor and 
the contracting officer, and made a part of the contract file. Copies of 
executed advance agreements will be distributed to the cognizant audit 
office when applicable.
    (d) All advance agreements will be incorporated in full in the 
subsequent contract(s) to which they pertain, prior to award.

<R05>
2834.002-70  Policy.

    In accordance with Pub. L. 98-577, the Small Business and Federal 
Procurement Competition Enhancement Act of 1984, an executive agency may 
establish dollar thresholds for the designation of a major system. 
Accordingly, dollar thresholds for a major system under Office of 
Management and Budget Circular A-109 are designated below.
    (a) Major Automated Information System. Within the Department of 
Justice, a major automated information system is one whose life cycle 
cost is in excess of $40 million.
    (b) Major Real Property System. (1) By purchase, when the assessed 
value of the property exceeds $60 million.
    (2) By lease, when the annual rental charges, including basic 
services (e.g., cleaning, guards, maintenance), exceed $1.5 million.
    (3) By transfer from another agency at no cost when the assessed 
value of the property exceeds $12 million.
    (c) Research and Development (R&D) System. Any R&D activity expected 
to exceed $0.5 million for the R&D phase is subject to OMB Circular A-
109, unless exempted by the head of the contracting activity.
    (d) Any Other System or Activity. The head of the contracting 
activity responsible for the system may designate any system or activity 
as a Major System under OMB Circular A-109 as a result of Departmental 
review, e.g., selected systems designed to support more than one 
principal organizational unit.
    (e) Exemption. The Assistant Attorney General for Administration, 
upon recommendation by the head of the contracting activity responsible 
for the system, may determine that, because of the routine nature of the 
acquisition, the system (e.g., an information system utilizing only off-
the-shelf

[[Page 641]]

hardware or software) will be exempt from the OMB Circular A-109 
process, although by virtue of its life cycle costs, it would otherwise 
be identified as ``major'' in response to OMB Circular A-11.

<R05>
2835.001-70  Definitions.

    (a) Research is a systematic, intensive, scientific study including 
experimentation directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding 
of those fields of the sciences related to the solution of mission 
related problems.
    (b) Development as used in the JAR, is the systematic use of the 
knowledge and understanding derived from research efforts directed 
toward the solution of specific problems or the formulation of specific 
projects or processes, and the subsequent production of useful 
materials, devices, systems, methods, or prototypes.
    (c) Research and development activities are those activities which 
include: Strategic planning and analysis leading to the performance of 
research or development; research or development leading to the creation 
of prototype equipment or processes; as well as operational testing; 
experimentation; field implementation; and evaluation of such equipment 
or processes. The following are illustrative of research and development 
activities: Theoretical analyses; exploratory studies and experiments in 
any field of science and technology; developmental efforts requiring the 
practical application of investigative findings and theories of a 
scientific or technical nature; the use of such quantities and kinds of 
equipment, supplies, parts, accessories, or patent rights thereto and 
drawings or designs thereof as well as services, tests, and reports 
necessary for, or incidental to the performance of experimental, 
developmental or research work. The term research and development 
activities, as used in this part, ordinarily encompasses those 
activities listed above. However, in an exceptional case, depending upon 
the particular facts, some kinds of efforts not set forth above could be 
categorized as research and development activities within this part. 
These activities do not ordinarily include: Routine product testing; 
quality control; mapping; collection of general purpose statistics; 
experimental production; routine evaluation of an experimental program 
or an operational program; activities concerned primarily with the 
dissemination of scientific information or the training of scientific 
and technical personnel. However, in an exceptional case, depending upon 
the particular facts and circumstances, some kinds of efforts excluded 
in the preceding sentence could be research and development activities 
within this supplemental regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 2835.003-70  Policy and procedures.

    Requiring activities and contracting offices shall adhere to the 
policies and procedures in this Section in acquiring R&D services.
    (a) Acquisition approvals. All requirements for R&D activities of 
more than $25,000 shall be submitted to the Assistant Attorney General 
for Administration (AAG/A) for approval prior to solicitation and award 
by the contracting office. Requirements for R&D will be submitted for 
approval via the Systems Policy Staff, OIT, and the Office of the 
Procurement Executive, who will review the submission and recommend to 
the AAG/A the appropriate action. The proposed R&D project shall be 
reviewed for the following elements.
    (1) The requirement is not duplicative of any R&D activity 
previously conducted or in progress.
    (2) The statement of work clearly and adequately describes the 
objectives of the R&D project.
    (b) Contracting for R&D requirements. Approval of the requirement by 
the AAG/A does not constitute approval of the method of procurement or 
contract type. Such decisions will be made by the contracting officer in 
accordance with applicable regulations.

[[Page 643]]

    (c) R&D requirements of $25,000 or less shall be approved by the 
heads of the contracting activity as defined in 2802.102(c) following 
review by the Systems Policy Staff and Office of the Procurement 
Executive.
[51 FR 759, Jan. 8, 1986]


<R05>
2835.005-70  Work statement.

    (a) The preparation of a clear, concise, and complete statement of 
work is essential to sound contracting for R&D activities. Work 
statements must be individually tailored by technical and contracting 
personnel to attain the desired degree of flexibility for contractor 
creativity, both in submitting proposals and in contract performance. 
Distinction must be made between level of effort (term) work statements 
which generally require the furnishing of technical effort and a report 
on the results thereof, and task (completion) work statements which 
generally require development of tangible end items designed to meet 
specific functional requirements.
    (b) In preparing statements of work for R&D activities the following 
elements shall be considered:
    (1) A general description of the required objectives and the desired 
results;
    (2) All background information helpful to a clear understanding of 
the requirements and how they evolved;
    (3) Technical considerations which affect the requirements such as 
known specific phenomena or techniques;
    (4) A detailed description of the technical requirements and 
subordinate or associated tasks;
    (5) A description of the reporting requirements and any other 
deliverable items such as data, experimental hardware, prototypes, etc.; 
and,
    (6) Other special considerations.

provision or clause to accommodate equipment peculiar to an individual 
acquisition; provided that the variations include the salient features 
of the JAR provision or clause and are not inconsistent with the intent, 
principle, and substance of the JAR provision or clause or related 
coverage of the subject matter.

<R05>
2852.201-70  Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR).

    The following clause is recommended for use in solicitations and 
contracts to delineate COTR responsibility and authority is accordance 
with 2801.70.

             Contracting Officer's Technical Representative

    (a) Mr./Ms. (Name) of (Organization) (Room No.), (Building), 
(Address), (Area Code & Telephone No.), is hereby designated to act as 
Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) under this 
contract.
    (b) The COTR is responsible for: receiving all deliverables; 
inspecting and accepting the supplies or services provided hereunder in 
accordance with the terms and conditions of this contract; providing 
direction to the contractor which clarifies the contract effort, fills 
in details or otherwise serves to accomplish the contractual Scope of 
Work; evaluating performance; and certifying all invoices/vouchers for 
acceptance of the supplies or services furnished for payment prior to 
forwarding the original invoice to the payment office and a conformed 
copy to the Contracting Officer.
    (c) The COTR does not have the authority to alter the contractor's 
obligations under the contract, direct changes that fall within the 
purview of the General Provisions clause entitled ``Changes,'' and/or 
modify any of the expressed terms, conditions, specification, or cost of 
the agreement. If as a result of technical discussions it is desirable 
to alter/change contractual obligations or the Scope of Work, the 
Contracting Officer shall issue such changes in writing and signed.

                             (End of clause)


<R05>
2852.210-70  Brand name or equal.

    This clause shall be used in accordance with 2810.004-70. (As used 
in this clause, the term ``brand name'' includes identification of 
products by make and model.) When this clause is used, the salient 
features of the ``brand name'' item must be set forth in the 
solicitation in order to permit offerors of ``equal products'' to bid.

                           Brand Name or Equal

    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been 
identified in the schedule by a ``brand name or equal'' description, 
such identification is intended to be descriptive but not restrictive, 
and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will 
be satisfactory. Bids offering ``equal'' products (including products of 
the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) 
will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in 
the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient 
characteristics and requirements listed in the invitation.
    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in his bid that he is 
offering an ``equal'' product, his bid shall be considered as offering a 
brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.
    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an ``equal'' product, the 
brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in 
the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be 
otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the 
determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the 
responsibility of the Government and will be based on information 
furnished by the bidder or identified in his bid as well as other 
information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Caution to 
Bidders: The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or 
securing any information which is not identified in the bid and 
reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to ensure 
that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a 
part of his bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, 
drawings, or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity 
to; (i) determine whether the product offered meets the salient 
characteristics requirement of the invitation for bids, and (ii) 
establish exactly what the bidder proposed to furnish and what the 
Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The 
information furnished may include specific references to information 
previously furnished or information otherwise available to the 
purchasing activity.
    (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it

<R05>
2870.101  Definitions.

    Throughout this regulation the following words and terms are used as 
defined in this subpart unless the context in which they appear clearly 
requires a different meaning.
    (a) Acquisition means the acquiring, by lease with appropriated 
funds, of an interest in improved real property for use by the Federal 
Government whether the space is already in existence or must be 
constructed.

    Acquisition begins at the point when agency needs are established 
and includes the description of requirements to satisfy agency needs, 
market survey, solicitation, award of lease, lease performance, lease 
administration, and those technical and management functions directly 
related to the process of fulfilling agency space needs by contract.
    (b) Contract means lease.
    (c) Contractor means lessor.
    (d) Landlord or lessor means any individual, firm, partnership, 
trust, association, State or local government, or other legal entity 
that leases real property to the Government.
    (e) Lease or leasehold interest in real property means a conveyance 
to the Government of the right of exclusive possession of real property 
for a definite period of time by a landlord. It may include services 
provided by the landlord such as heating, ventilation, air conditioning, 
utilities, custodial services, and other related services furnished by 
the landlord.

2870.201  Authority to lease.

    The authority for Federal agencies to enter leases is found in 41 
CFR 101-18.104. Contracting officers exercising leases on behalf of the 
Department or of a bureau must assure that all necessary delegations 
have been obtained from the General Services Administration (GSA) and 
are within the authority of the Justice Property Management Regulations 
(JPMR), subpart 128-1.60.


<R05>
2870.202  Review by the Office of the Procurement Executive.

    Leases are subject to the same review requirements as other types of 
acquisitions, in accordance with the JAR 2801.602-70. These leases which 
exceed the minimum dollar thresholds for contract review must be 
submitted to the Office of the Procurement Executive for review and 
approval prior to the signing of the lease agreement on behalf of the 
Government.


<R05>
2870.203  Competition.

    The competition requirements of FAR part 6 apply to the acquisition 
of leasehold interests in real property. The acquisition of space 
through other than full and open competition must be held to the 
smallest number practicable and be justified in writing and approved in 
accordance with FAR 6.303 and 6.304.


<R05>
2870.204  Procedures for executing a lease.

    (a) Pursuant to the requirements of the delegations issued by GSA, 
all lease acquisitions shall be performed in accordance with the
