                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 2006), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of textual material 
appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

        Subpart 1501.6_Contracting Authority and Responsibilities


<R05>
Sec. 1501.602-3  Ratification of unauthorized commitments.

    (a) Applicability. The provisions of this section apply to all 
unauthorized commitments, whether oral or written and without regard to 
dollar value. Examples of unauthorized commitments are;
    (1) Ordering supplies or services by an individual without 
contracting authority;
    (2) Unauthorized direction of work through assignment of orders or 
tasks;
    (3) Unauthorized addition of new work;
    (4) Unauthorized direction of contractors to subcontract with 
particular firms; or
    (5) Any other unauthorized direction which changed the terms and 
conditions of the contract.
    (b)(1) Ratification Approval. The Chief of the Contracting Office 
(CCO) is delegated authority to be the ratifying official. In order to 
act as the ratifying official, a CCO must have delegated contracting 
officer authority. A CCO cannot approve a ratification if he/she acted 
as a contracting officer in preparing the determination and findings

[[Page 7]]

required under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    (2) The CCOs defined in 1502.100 for purposes of ratification 
authority only must meet the following criteria:
    (i) Must possess a contracting officer's warrant and be in the 1102 
job series;
    (ii) Are prohibited from re-delegating their ratification authority;
    (iii) Must submit copies of ratification actions to the cognizant 
Office of Acquisition Management Division Director at Headquarters; and
    (iv) As with other ratifying officials, must abide by the other 
limitations on ratification of unauthorized commitments set forth in FAR 
1.602-3(c) and the EPAAR.
    (c) Procedures. (1) The program office shall notify the cognizant 
contracting office by memorandum of the circumstances surrounding an 
unauthorized commitment. The notification shall include:
    (i) All relevant documents and records;
    (ii) Documentation of the necessity for the work and benefit derived 
by the Government;
    (iii) A statement of the delivery status of the supplies or services 
associated with the unauthorized commitment;
    (iv) A list of the procurement sources solicited (if any) and the 
rationale for the source selected;
    (v) If only one source was solicited, a justification for other than 
full and open competition (JOFOC) as required by FAR 6.302, FAR 6.303, 
and 1506.303, or for simplified acquisition procedures exceeding the 
competition threshold in FAR 13.106, a sole source justification as 
required by 1513.170;
    (vi) A statement of steps taken or proposed to prevent reoccurrence 
of any unauthorized commitment.
    (2) The Division Director (or equivalent) of the responsible office 
shall approve the memorandum. If expenditure of funds is involved, the 
program office shall include a Procurement Request/Order, EPA Form 1900-
8, with funding sufficient to cover the action. The appropriation data 
cited on the 1900-8 shall be valid for the period in which the 
unauthorized commitment was made.
    (3) Upon receiving the notification, the Contracting Officer shall 
prepare a determination and findings regarding ratification of the 
unauthorized commitment for the ratifying official. The determination 
and findings shall include sufficient detail to support the recommended 
action. If ratification of the unauthorized commitment is recommended, 
the determination and findings shall include a determination that the 
price is fair and reasonable. To document the determination, additional 
information may be required from the Contractor. Concurrence by the 
Office of General Counsel is not mandatory, but shall be sought in 
difficult or unusual cases.
    (4) The ratifying official may inform the Inspector General (IG) of 
the action by memorandum through the Head of the Contracting Activity 
(HCA). For ratification actions exceeding the small purchase limitation, 
the ratifying official shall submit a memorandum to the Assistant 
Administrator for Administration and Resources Management through the 
HCA for transmittal to the Assistant, Associate, or Regional 
Administrator (or equivalent level) of the person responsible for the 
unauthorized commitment. This memorandum should contain a brief 
description of the circumstances surrounding the unauthorized 
commitment, recommend corrective action, and include a copy of any 
memorandum sent to the IG. Submission of a memorandum to the appropriate 
Assistant, Associate, or Regional Administrator for unauthorized 
commitments at or below the small purchase limitation is optional and 
may be accomplished at the discretion of the ratifying official.
    (d) Paid Advertisements. (1) EPA is generally not authorized to 
ratify improperly ordered paid advertisements. The ratifying official, 
however, may determine payment is proper subject to the limitations in 
FAR 1.602-3(c) if the individual responsible for the unauthorized 
commitment acted in good faith to comply with Agency acquisition 
policies and procedures.
    (2) The paying office shall forward invoice claims received in its 
office for improper paid advertisements to the

[[Page 8]]

cognizant ratifying official for a determination regarding ratification 
of the action.
    (3) If the ratifying official determines that an unauthorized 
commitment cannot be ratified by the Agency, the ratifying official 
shall instruct the submitter to present its claim to the General 
Accounting Office in accordance with the instructions contained in 4 CFR 
part 31, Claims Against the United States, General Procedures.
    (e) Payment of Properly Ratified Claims. After the unauthorized 
commitment is ratified, the Contractor must submit an invoice (or 
resubmit an invoice if one was previously submitted) citing the 
appropriate contract or purchase order number.

submitted to the cost advisory group at the contracting office for 
review by the Office of Audit as prescribed by FAR 49.107. All such 
audits will be coordinated through the cost advisory group in the

    (a) Authority. Section 109(e) of the Superfund Amendments and 
Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) is cited as authority.
    (b) Application. (1) The contracting officer may use other than full 
and open competition to acquire the services of experts for use in 
preparing or prosecuting a civil or criminal action under SARA whether 
or not the expert is expected to testify at trial. The contracting 
officer need not prepare the written justification under FAR 6.303 when 
acquiring expert services under the authority of section 109(e) of SARA. 
The contracting officer shall document the official contract file when 
using this authority.
    (2) The contracting officer shall give notice to the Agency's 
Competition Advocate whenever a contract award is made using other than 
full and open competitition under this authority. The notice shall 
contain a copy of the contract and the summary of negotiations.

[53 FR 31872, Aug. 22, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 1506.303-2  Content.

    The documentation requirements in this section apply only to 
acquisitions processed using other than small purchase procedures. 
(Refer to 1513.170 for documentation for small purchase acquisitions).
    (a) The initiating office shall prepare a written justification for 
other than full and open competition (JOFOC) that documents the facts 
and circumstances substantiating the infeasibility of full and open 
competition for each recommended limited sources or sole source 
acquisition when required by FAR 6.302.
    (b) The recommendation shall be entitled ``Justification for Other 
Than Full and Open Competition'' and shall be signed at the programmatic 
Division Director or comparable office level prior to submission with 
the procurement request. The JOFOC shall contain the information 
prescribed in FAR 6.303-2 (a) and (b).
    (c) If unusual and compelling urgency (see FAR 6.303-2) is a basis 
for the JOFOC, then the following applies. Explain the circumstances 
that led to the need for an urgent contractual action. Explain why the 
requirement could not have been processed in sufficient time to permit 
full and open competition. It should be noted that the existence of 
legislation, court order, or Presidential mandate is not, of itself, a 
sufficient basis for a JOFOC. However, the circumstances necessitating 
legislation, court order, or Presidential mandate may justify 
contractual action on an other than full and open competition basis.
    (d) If the proposed acquisition has been synopsized in accordance 
with the applicable requirements in FAR subpart 5.2, the Contracting 
Officer must incorporate the evaluation of responses to the synopsis in 
the JOFOC. (See 1506.371(d) for contents of the evaluation document).

    This subpart establishes EPA policy and procedures for evaluation of 
contractor performance. Contracting officers shall insert the contract 
clause at 1552.209-76 in all solicitations and contracts with an 
estimated dollar value in excess of $100,000. For acquisitions involving 
options, the total estimated value of the acquisition shall include the 
estimated base amount plus the option(s) amount(s).

<R05>
Sec. 1509.170-2  Purpose.

    This subpart provides guidance to program and contracting personnel 
regarding the evaluation of contractor performance. It establishes a 
uniform method for determining and recording the effectiveness of 
contractors in meeting contractual obligations. Additionally, this 
subpart details a systematic approach for identifying and maintaining 
records of contractors' performance histories.

[64 FR 20203, Apr. 26, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 1509.170-3  Applicability.

    (a) This subpart applies to all EPA acquisitions in excess of 
$100,000, except for architect-engineer acquisitions, acquisitions 
awarded under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 8.6, 
Acquisitions from Federal Prison Industries, Incorporated, FAR Subpart 
8.7, Acquisitions from Nonprofit Agencies Employing People Who Are Blind 
or Severely Disabled, and FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial 
Items. FAR 36.604 provides detailed instructions for architect-engineer 
contractor performance evaluations.
    (b) The acquisition of commercial items in accordance with FAR 
13.106 is not applicable to this subpart because simplified acquisition 
procedures do not require the creation or existence of

[[Page 15]]

a formal database for past performance evaluations. In cases where 
simplified acquisition procedures are not used to acquire commercial 
items (see FAR 12.203), this subpart is applicable to acquiring 
commercial items in excess of $100,000.
    (c) EPA Form 1900-26, Contracting Officer's Evaluation of Contractor 
Performance, and EPA Form 1900-27, Project Officer's Evaluation of 
Contractor Performance, applies to all performance evaluations completed 
prior to May 26, 1999. Thereafter, EPA Forms 1900-26 and 1900-27 are 
obsolete, and contracting officers shall complete all contractor 
performance evaluations by use of the National Institutes of Health's 
Contractor Performance System in accordance with EPAAR paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (d) Construction acquisitions shall be completed by use of the NIH 
construction module. Performance evaluations for construction 
acquisitions shall be completed in accordance with EPAAR 1509.170-5.

[64 FR 20203, Apr. 26, 1999, as amended at 67 FR 66344, Oct. 31, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 1509.170-4  Definitions.

    (a) Contractor Performance Report is an evaluation of a contractor's 
performance for a specified period of time.
    (b) Interim Report refers to a Contractor Performance Report that 
covers each 12 month period after the effective date of contract.
    (c) Final Report refers to a Contractor Performance Report that 
covers the last 12 months (or less) of contract performance.
    (d) Ratings refer to the numerical scores for each performance 
category. Ratings are defined as follows: 0 = unsatisfactory, 1 = poor, 
2 = fair, 3 = good, 4 = excellent, and 5 = outstanding.
    (e) Summary ratings refer to the ratings determined by one level 
above the contracting officer regarding disagreements between the 
contractor and the contracting officer. Summary ratings reflect the 
Agency's ultimate conclusion for the performance period being evaluated.
    (f) Performance Categories refer to the measures used to evaluate a 
contractor's performance. Performance categories include quality, cost 
control, timeliness of performance, business relations, compliance with 
labor standards, compliance with safety standards, and meeting Small 
Disadvantaged Business subcontracting requirements.

67 FR 66344, Oct. 31, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 1509.170-5  Policy.

    (a) Contracting officers are responsible for the timely completion 
of contractors' performance evaluations. The National Institutes of 
Health Contractor Performance System shall be used to record individual 
contractor performance histories on EPA contracts and to obtain 
contractor past performance information for use in EPA's source 
selection process.
    (b) For service type acquisitions, contracting officers shall use 
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Contractor Performance System to 
record evaluations for all contract performance periods expiring after 
May 26, 1999. For construction type acquisitions, contracting officers 
shall use the NIH system to record evaluations for all contract 
performance periods expiring after December 2, 2002.
    (c) Contractor evaluation information shall be recorded in 
Contractor Performance Reports (Report) which are generated by the 
National Institutes of Health system. Reports shall cover individual 
contractor evaluations at the contract level, which includes all work 
assignments, task orders, or delivery orders associated with the 12 
month period being evaluated (interim Report) or the last 12 months (or 
less) of contract performance (final Report).
    (d) The contracting officer must complete interim Reports covering 
each 12 month period after the effective date of contract for all 
contracts in excess of $100,000, except those acquisitions identified in 
1509.170-3, Applicability. In addition to interim Reports, the 
contracting officer must complete a final Report which covers the last 
12 months (or less) of contract performance.
    (e) The contracting officer shall initiate the process for 
completing interim Reports within five (5) business days after the end 
of each 12 months of contract performance. The contracting

[[Page 16]]

officer shall initiate the process for completing a final Report within 
five (5) business days after the end of the last 12 months (or less) of 
contract performance. Final Reports must be completed prior to contract 
closeout.
    (f) The contracting officer must complete interim and final Reports, 
including the project officer's evaluation of contractor performance, 
receipt of any contractor input, and resolution of summary ratings (if 
any) within 90 business days from the date the contracting officer 
initiates the evaluation.
    (g) Reports shall be used to inform other agencies and departments 
(upon request) about a contractor's performance on an EPA contract, and 
to assist the contracting officer and the Technical Evaluation Panel 
with evaluating past performance for future EPA acquisitions.
    (h) When evaluating proposals, contracting officers shall use the 
National Institutes of Health system to access Reports from other 
agencies or departments that are available in the National Institutes of 
Health database. Contracting Officers may need to access past 
performance information from other than the National Institutes of 
Health system if the National Institutes of Health system does not 
include applicable information.
    (i) In accordance with FAR 42.1503(b), the ultimate conclusion on 
the performance evaluation is the decision of the Agency. The 
contracting officer must ensure the accuracy of ratings for each 
performance category by verifying that information in the contract file 
corresponds with the project officer's designated ratings. A 
contractor's performance evaluation should closely parallel award fee 
determinations made under the contract.
    (j) In cases of novations involving successors-in-interest, a final 
evaluation of the predecessor contractor must be completed within five 
(5) business days after the end of the predecessor contractor's 
performance, and an interim evaluation of the successor contractor must 
be completed within five (5) business days after the end of each 12 
months of contract performance after the successor began performing. In 
cases of change-of-name agreements, the system shall be changed to 
reflect the new contractor's name.
    (k) Contracting officers must inform the Office of Debarment and 
Suspension of any repetitive unsatisfactory or poor (a score of 0 or 1) 
ratings encountered by the contractor.

<R05>
Sec. 1509.170-6  Filing of forms.

    The original copy of completed Contractor Performance Reports 
(interim and final) shall be filed in each individual contractor's 
official contract file. The National Institutes of Health Contractor 
Performance System will retain all reports for three (3) years after 
contract completion.

[64 FR 20204, Apr. 26, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 1509.170-7  Release of ratings.

    (a) Agencies and departments who subscribe to the National 
Institutes of Health's Contractor Performance System will have direct 
access to all Reports, including those of EPA, in the National 
Institutes of Health's database. Information on EPA contractors' 
performance ratings may also be obtained by contacting the EPA 
contracting officer responsible for the evaluation.
    (b) Contractors' performance ratings may be released to other 
Federal, State, and local Governments upon written request. The release 
to other Federal, State, and local Governments must stipulate that the 
information provided shall not be released outside of the requesting 
Government agency. In cases where the Federal agency is part of the 
National Institutes of Health Contract Performance System, a written 
request is not applicable.
    (c) Freedom of Information Act requests shall be processed by the 
EPA Freedom of Information Act office where the contract is located. 
Requests for past performance evaluations during the period the 
information may be used to provide source selection information shall be 
rejected if the requests are made by other than the Government personnel 
and the contractor whose performance is being evaluated.

<R05>
Sec. 1509.170-8  Contractor Performance Report.

    (a) Contractor Performance Reports (interim and final) must be 
prepared electronically by use of the National Institutes of Health's 
Contractor Performance System. Hard copy preparation of Reports shall 
not be used unless specifically instructed by the National Institutes of 
Health. The National Institutes of Health will provide EPA's Office of 
Acquisition Management Internal Oversight Service Center with specific 
instructions if hard copy use becomes necessary.
    (b) The performance categories and ratings used in the evaluation of 
contractor performance are described in the clause at 1552.209-76. The 
NIH system provides instructions to assist contracting officers and 
project officers with completing evaluations.

    Source: 65 FR 37291, June 14, 2000, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1509.403  Definitions.

    The ``Debarring Official'' and the ``Suspending Official'' as 
defined in FAR 9.403 is a designated individual located in the Office of 
Grants and Debarment. This Agency official is authorized to make the 
determinations and provide the notifications required under FAR subpart 
9.4 or this subpart, except for the determinations required by FAR 
9.405-1(a) which are to be made by the Head of the Contracting Activity. 
All compelling reason determinations to be made by the Debarring or 
Suspending Official under FAR subpart 9.4 or this subpart will be made 
only after coordination and consultation with the Head of the 
Contracting Activity. See also 40 CFR part 32.


<R05>
Sec. 1509.406  Debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 1509.406-3  Procedures.

    (a) Investigation and referral--(1) Contracting officer 
responsibility. (i) When contracting personnel discover information 
which indicates that a cause for debarment may exist, they shall 
promptly report such information to the cognizant Chief of the 
Contracting Office (CCO). Purchasing agents in simplified acquisition 
activities which do not come under the direct cognizance of a CCO shall 
report such information by memorandum, through their immediate 
supervisor, and addressed to the cognizant CCO responsible for their 
office's contract acquisitions.
    (ii) Contracting officers shall review ``The List of Parties 
Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs'' to 
ensure that the Agency does not solicit offers from, award contracts to, 
or consent to subcontracts with listed contractors.
    (2) Chief of the Contracting Office responsibility. When the Chief 
of the Contracting Office determines that sufficient information is 
available to indicate that a cause for debarment may exist, such 
information shall be promptly reported by memorandum to the HCA. The 
memorandum provides the Chief of the Contracting Office's assessment of 
the information, any investigative report or audit, and any additional 
information he/she has discovered.
    (3) HCA responsibility. Upon receipt of a report of a suspected 
debarment situation, the HCA shall take the following actions:
    (i) Notify the Director, Suspension and Debarment Division, that 
investigation of a potential debarment has been initiated.
    (ii) Review the reported information.
    (iii) Investigate as necessary to verify or develop additional 
information.
    (iv) Refer the matter through the Suspension and Debarment Division 
to the Debarring Official for consideration of debarment; request that 
the Suspension and Debarment Division evaluate the information and, if 
appropriate, refer the matter to the Debarring Official for 
consideration of debarment; or recommend to the Suspension and Debarment 
Division that the matter be closed without further action because the 
facts do not warrant debarment.
    (v) Obtain legal counsel's opinion on referrals or recommendations 
made to the Debarring Official.

[[Page 18]]

    (vi) Notify EPA Contracting Officers of those Contractors who are 
ineligible for solicitation, award, or subcontracting but who do not 
appear on the GSA Consolidated List; e.g., those who are ineligible 
based on a settlement reached by the Debarring Official under which the 
Contractor has agreed to voluntarily exclude itself from participation 
in Government contracting/subcontracting for a specified period or 
because of a Notice of Proposal to Debar.
    (4) Any official. When information is discovered which may indicate 
potential criminal or civil fraud activity, such information must be 
referred promptly to the EPA Office of Inspector General.
    (5) Debarring Official's responsibility. The Debarring Official 
shall:
    (i) Review referrals from the HCA together with the HCA's 
recommendations, if any, and determine whether further consideration by 
the Debarring Official is warranted and take such actions as are 
required by FAR subpart 9.4;
    (ii) Obtain the HCA's recommendation prior to reaching a voluntary 
exclusion settlement with a Contractor in lieu of debarment;
    (iii) Promptly notify the HCA of Contractors with whom a settlement 
in lieu of debarment has been reached under which the Contractor 
voluntarily excludes itself from or restricts its participation in 
Government contracting/subcontracting for a specified period; and of 
Contractors who have received a Notice of Proposal to Debar.

          Subpart 1509.5_Organizational Conflicts of Interests


<R05>
Sec. 1509.500  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart establishes EPA policy and procedures for identifying, 
evaluating, and resolving organizational conflicts of interest. EPA's 
policy is to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate organizational conflicts of 
interest. If EPA is unable to neutralize or mitigate the effects of a 
potential conflict of interest, EPA will disqualify the prospective 
contractor or will terminate the contract when potential or actual 
conflicts are identified after award.

Sec. 1509.502  Applicability.

    This subpart applies to all EPA contracts except agreements with 
other Federal agencies. However, this subpart applies to contracts with 
the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the 8(a) program.


<R05>
Sec. 1509.503  Waiver.

    The Head of the Contracting Activity may waive any general rule or 
procedure of this subpart by determining that its application in a 
particular situation would not be in the Government's interest. Any 
request for waiver must be in accordance with FAR 9.503. The Assistant 
General Counsel for Contracts and Information Law shall be consulted on 
such waiver requests.

<R05>
Sec. 1509.505-4  Obtaining access to proprietary information.

    Contractors gaining access to confidential business information of 
other companies in performing advisory services for EPA shall comply 
with the special requirements of 40 CFR part 2 and the provisions of 
their contracts relating to the treatment of confidential business 
information.


<R05>
Sec. 1509.505-70  Information sources.

    (a) Disclosure. Prospective EPA Contractors responding to 
solicitations or submitting unsolicited proposals shall provide 
information to the Contracting Officer for use in identifying, 
evaluating, or resolving potential organizational conflicts of interest. 
The submittal may be a certification or a disclosure, pursuant to 
paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section.
    (1) If the prospective contractor is not aware of any information 
bearing on the existence of any organizational conflict of interest, it 
may so certify.

[[Page 19]]

    (2) Prospective contractors not certifying in accordance with 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section must provide a disclosure statement 
which describes concisely all relevant facts concerning any past, 
present, or planned interests relating to the work to be performed and 
bearing on whether they, including their chief executives, directors, or 
any proposed consultant or subcontractor, may have a potential 
organizational conflict of interest.
    (b) Failure to disclose information. Any prospective contractor 
failing to provide full disclosure, certification, or other required 
information will not be eligible for award. Nondisclosure or 
misrepresentation of any relevant information may also result in 
disqualification from award, termination of the contract for default, or 
debarment from Government contracts, as well as other legal action or 
prosecution. In response to solicitations, EPA will consider any 
inadvertent failure to provide disclosure certification as a ``minor 
informality'' (as explained in FAR 14.405); however, the prospective 
contractor must correct the omission promptly.
    (c) Exception. Where the Contractor has previously submitted a

Response Action Contract (RAC) solicitations and contracts, except Site 
Specific solicitations and contracts. The term ``RAC'' in the Limitation 
of Future Contracting clauses includes not only RAC solicitations and 
contracts but other long term response action solicitations and 
contracts that provide professional architect/engineer, technical, and 
management services to EPA to support remedial response, enforcement 
oversight and non-time critical removal activities under the 
Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and

Liability Act of 1980, as amended by the Superfund Amendments 
Reauthorization Act of 1986; and the Robert T. Stafford Natural Disaster 
Act pursuant to the Federal Response Plan and other laws to help address 
and/or mitigate endangerment to the public health, welfare or 
environment during emergencies and natural disasters, and to support 
States and communities in preparing for the responses to releases of 
hazardous substances.
    (1) Alternate I shall be used in all Emergency and Rapid Response 
Services (ERRS) solicitations and contracts, except site specific 
solicitations and contracts. The term ``ERRS'' in the Limitation of 
Future Contracting clauses includes not only ERRS solicitations and 
contracts but other emergency response type solicitations and contracts 
that provide fast responsive environmental cleanup services for 
hazardous substances/wastes/contaminants/material and petroleum

included in the term ``treatability studies.''
    (2) Alternate II shall be used in all Superfund Technical Assistance 
and Removal Team (START) solicitations and contracts. The term ``START'' 
in the Limitation of Future Contracting clauses include not only START 
solicitations and contracts but other site removal and technical support 
solicitations and contracts that include activities related to technical 
analyses in determining the nature and extent of contamination at a site 
and making recommendations regarding response technologies.
    (3) Alternate III shall be used in all Environmental Services 
Assistance Team (ESAT) solicitations and contracts.
    (4) Alternate IV shall be used in all Enforcement Support Services 
(ESS) solicitations and contracts. The term ``ESS'' in the Limitation of 
Future Contracting clauses not only includes ESS solicitation and 
contracts but other enforcement support type solicitations and contracts 
that involve removal actions, mandatory notices to Potentially 
Responsible Parties (PRPs), penalty assessments, public comment periods, 
negotiations with PRPs, and statutes of limitations for pursuing cost 
recovery. The enforcement support services required under the contract 
may be conducted to support EPA enforcement actions under any 
environmental statute.
    (5) Alternate V shall be used in all Superfund Headquarters Support 
solicitations and contracts. The Contracting Officer is authorized to 
modify paragraph (c) of Alternate V to reflect any unique limitations 
applicable to the program requirements.

and contracts.
    (d) The Contracting Officer shall insert the clause at 1552.209-75 
in Superfund solicitations and contracts in excess of the simplified 
acquisition threshold, where the solicitation or contract does not 
include (EPAAR) 48 CFR 1552.211-74, Work Assignments, Alternate I, or a 
similar clause requiring conflict of interest certifications during 
contract performance. This clause requires an annual conflict of 
interest certification from contractors when the contract does not 
require the submission of other conflict of interest certifications 
during contract performance. Contracts requiring annual certifications 
include: Site Specific contracts, the Contract Laboratory Program (CLP), 
and the Sample Management Office (SMO) contracts. The annual 
certification requires a contractor to certify that all organizational 
conflicts of interest have been reported, and that its personnel 
performing work under EPA contracts or relating to EPA contracts have 
been informed of their obligation to report personal and organizational 
conflicts of interest to the Contractor. The annual certification shall 
cover the one-year period from the date of contract award for the 
initial certification, and a one-year period starting from the previous 
certification for subsequent certifications. The certification must be 
received by the Contracting Officer no later than 45 days after the 
close of the certification period covered.

                                there are widespread information gaps.
                                In addition, because of the
                                deficiencies, weaknesses, and/or
                                information gaps, serious concerns exist
                                on the part of the technical evaluation
                                team about the offeror's ability to
                                perform the required work.

                                incomplete, unclear, or indicates an
                                inadequate approach to, or understanding
                                of the factor. The technical evaluation
                                team believes there is question as to
                                whether the offeror would be able to
                                perform satisfactorily.
3............................  The response to the factor is adequate.
                                Overall, it meets the specifications and
                                requirements, such that the technical

                                technical requirements is acceptable
                                with the possibility of more than
                                adequate performance.

    In addition to the information required by FAR 15.305(a)(3), the 
technical evaluation documentation shall include:
    (a) Score sheets prepared by each individual team member must be 
made available upon the contracting officer's request. For contracts 
valued at $10,000,000 or less, the technical evaluation may be recorded 
on the short form technical evaluation format (EPA Form 1900-61) or 
another form specifically developed for the solicitation; and
    (b) A statement that the respective team members are free from 
actual or potential personal conflicts of interest, and are in 
compliance with the Office of Government Ethics ethics provisions at 5 
CFR part 2635.
    (c) Any information which might reveal that an offeror has an actual 
or potential organizational conflict of interest.

who are evaluating proposals at his/her discretion.
    (b) These individuals would then use this information to perform a 
cost realism analysis as described in FAR 15.404-1(d). Any 
inconsistencies between the proposals and the solicitation requirements 
and/or any inconsistencies between the cost/price and other than cost/
price proposals should be identified.

<R05>
Sec. 1515.404-4  Profit.

    This section implements FAR 15.404-4 and prescribes the EPA 
structured approach for establishing profit or fee prenegotiation 
objectives.


<R05>
Sec. 1515.404-470  Policy.

    (a) The Agency's policy is to utilize profit to attract contractors 
who possess talents and skills necessary to the accomplishment of the 
objectives of the Agency, and to stimulate efficient contract 
performance. In negotiating profit/fee, it is necessary that all 
relevant factors be considered, and that fair and reasonable amounts be 
negotiated which give the contractor a profit objective commensurate 
with the nature of the work to be performed, the contractor's input to 
the total performance, and the risks assumed by the contractor.
    (b) The purpose of EPA's structured approach is:
    (1) To provide a standard method of evaluation;
    (2) To ensure consideration of all relevant factors;
    (3) To provide a basis for documentation and explanation of the 
profit or fee negotiation objective; and

[[Page 27]]

    (4) To allow contractors to earn profits commensurate with the 
assumption of risk.
    (c) The profit-analysis factors prescribed in the EPA structured 
approach for analyzing profit or fee include those prescribed by FAR 
15.404(d)(1), and additional factors authorized by FAR 15.404(d)(2) to 
foster achievement of program objectives. These profit or fee factors 
are prescribed in 1515.404-471.


<R05>
Sec. 1515.404-471  EPA structured approach for developing profit or fee 
          objectives.

    (a) General. To properly reflect differences among contracts, and to 
select an appropriate relative profit/fee in consideration of these 
differences, weightings have been developed for application by the 
contracting officer to standard measurement bases representative of the 
prescribed profit factors cited in FAR 15.404(d) and EPAAR 1515.404-
471(b)(1). Each profit factor or subfactor, or its components, has been 
assigned weights relative to their value to the contract's overall 
effort, and the range of weights to be applied to each profit factor.
    (b)(1) Profit/fee factors. The factors set forth in this paragraph, 
and the weighted ranges listed after each factor, shall be used in all 
instances where the profit/fee is negotiated.

                 Contractor's Input to Total Performance
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                               Weight Range  (Percent)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Direct material............................  1 to 4.
Professional/technical labor...............  8 to 15.
Professional/technical overhead............  6 to 9.
General labor..............................  5 to 9.
General overhead...........................  4 to 7.
Subcontractors.............................  1 to 4.
Other direct costs.........................  1 to 3.
General and administrative expenses........  5 to 8.
Contractor's assumption of contract cost     0 to 6.
 risk.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) The contracting officer shall first measure the ``Contractor's 
Input to Total Performance'' by the assignment of a profit percentage 
within the designated weight ranges to each element of contract cost. 
Such costs are multiplied by the specific percentages to arrive at a 
specific dollar profit or fee.
    (3) The amount calculated for facilities capital cost of money 
(FCCM) shall not be included as part of the cost base for computation of 
profit or fee. The profit or fee objective shall be reduced by an amount 
equal to the amount of facilities capital cost of money allowed. A 
complete discussion of the determination of facilities capital cost of 
money and its application and administration is set forth in FAR 31.205-
10, and the Appendix to the FAR (see 48 CFR 9904.414).
    (4) After computing a total dollar profit or fee for the 
Contractor's Input to Total Performance, the contracting officer shall 
calculate the specific profit dollars assigned for cost risk and 
performance. This is accomplished by multiplying the total Government 
cost objective, exclusive of any FCCM, by the specific weight assigned 
to cost risk and performance. The contracting officer shall then 
determine the profit or fee objective by adding the total profit dollars 
for the Contractor's Input to Total Performance to the specific dollar 
profits assigned to cost risk and performance. The contracting officer 
shall use EPA Form 1900-2 in hardcopy or electronic copy equivalent to 
facilitate the calculation of the profit or fee objective.
    (5) The weight factors discussed in this section are designed for 
arriving at profit or fee objectives for other than nonprofit and not-
for-profit organizations. Nonprofit and not-for-profit organizations are 
addressed as follows:
    (i) Nonprofit and not-for-profit organizations are defined as those 
business entities organized and operated:
    (A) Exclusively for charitable, scientific, or educational purposes;
    (B) Where no part of the net earnings inure to the benefit of any 
private shareholder or individual;
    (C) Where no substantial part of the activities is for propaganda or 
otherwise attempting to influence legislation or participating in any 
political campaign on behalf of any candidate for public office; and
    (D) Which are exempt from Federal income taxation under Section 51 
of the Internal Revenue Code. (26 U.S.C.)
    (ii) For contracts with nonprofit and not-for-profit organizations 
where fees are involved, special factor of -3 percent shall be assigned 
in all cases.
    (c) Assignment of values to specific factors--(1) General. In making 
a judgment

[[Page 28]]

on the value of each factor, the contracting officer should be governed 
by the definition, description, and purpose of the factors, together 
with considerations for evaluation set forth in this paragraph.
    (2) Contractor's input to total performance. This factor is a 
measure of how much the contractor is expected to contribute to the 
overall effort necessary to meet the contract performance requirements 
in an efficient manner. This factor, which is separate from the 
contractor's responsibility for contract performance, takes into account 
what resources are necessary, and the creativity and ingenuity needed 
for the contractor to perform the statement of work successfully. This 
is a recognition that within a given performance output, or within a 
given sales dollar figure, necessary efforts on the part of individual 
contractors can vary widely in both value, quantity, and quality, and 
that the profit or fee objective should reflect the extent and nature of 
the contractor's contribution to total performance. Greater profit 
opportunity should be provided under contracts requiring a high degree 
of professional and managerial skill and to prospective contractors 
whose skills, facilities, and technical assets can be expected to lead 
to efficient and economical contract performance. The evaluation of this 
factor requires an analysis of the cost content of the proposed contract 
as follows:
    (i) Direct material (purchased parts and other material). (A) 
Analysis of these cost items shall include an evaluation of the 
managerial and technical effort necessary to obtain the required 
material. This evaluation shall include consideration of the number of 
orders and suppliers, and whether established sources are available or 
new sources must be developed. The contracting officer shall also 
determine whether the contractor will, for example, obtain the materials 
by routine orders or readily available supplies (particularly those of 
substantial value in relation to the total contract costs), or by 
detailed subcontracts for which the prime contractor will be required to 
develop complex specifications involving creative design.
    (B) Consideration should be given to the managerial and technical 
efforts necessary for the prime contractor to administer subcontracts, 
and to select subcontractors, including efforts to break out 
subcontracts from sole sources, through the introduction of competition.
    (C) Recognized costs proposed as direct material costs such as scrap 
charges shall be treated as material for profit evaluation.
    (D) If intracompany transfers are accepted at price, in accordance 
with FAR 31.205-26(e), they should be excluded from the profit or fee 
computation. Other intracompany transfers shall be evaluated by 
individual components of cost, i.e., material, labor, and overhead.
    (ii) Professional/technical and general labor. Analysis of labor 
should include evaluation of the comparative quality and level of the 
talents and experience to be employed. In evaluating labor for the 
purpose of assigning profit dollars, consideration should be given to 
the amount of notable scientific talent or unusual or scarce talent 
needed, in contrast to journeyman effort or supporting personnel. The 
diversity, or lack thereof, of scientific and engineering specialties 
required for contract performance, and the corresponding need for 
supervision and coordination, should also be evaluated.
    (iii) Overhead and general and administrative expenses. (A) Where 
practicable, analysis of these overhead items of cost should include the 
evaluation of the individual elements of these expenses, and how much 
they contribute to contract performance. This analysis should include a 
determination of the amount of labor within these overhead pools, and 
how this labor would be treated if it were considered as direct labor 
under the contract. The allocable labor elements should be given the 
same profit consideration as if they were direct labor. The other 
elements of indirect cost pools should be evaluated to determine whether 
they are routine expenses such as utilities, depreciation, and 
maintenance, and therefore given less profit consideration.
    (B) The contractor's accounting system need not break down its 
overhead

[[Page 29]]

expenses within the classification of professional/technical overhead, 
general overhead and general and administrative expenses.
    (iv) Subcontractors. (A) Subcontract costs should be analyzed from 
the standpoint of the talents and skills of the subcontractors. The 
analysis should consider if the prime contractor normally should be 
expected to have people with comparable expertise employed as full-time 
staff, or if the contract requires skills not normally available in an 
employer-employee relationship. Where the prime contractor is using 
subcontractors to perform labor which would normally be expected to be 
done in-house, the rating factor should generally be at or near 1 
percent. Where exceptional expertise is retained, or the prime 
contractor is participating in the mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] program, 
the assigned weight should be nearer to the high end of the range.
    (v) Other direct costs. The analysis of these costs should be 
similar to the analysis of direct material.
    (3) Contractor's assumption of contract cost risk. (i) The risk of 
contract costs should be shifted to the fullest extent practicable to 
contractors, and the Government should assign a rating that reflects the 
degree of risk assumption. Evaluation of this risk requires a 
determination of the degree of cost responsibility the contractor 
assumes, the reliability of the cost estimates in relation to the task 
assumed, and the chance of the contractor's success or failure. This 
factor is specifically limited to the risk of contract costs. Thus, such 
risks of losing potential profits in other fields are not within the 
scope of this factor.
    (ii) The first determination of the degree of cost responsibility 
assumed by the contractor is related to the sharing of total risk of 
contract cost by the Government and the contractor, depending on 
selection of contract type. The extremes are a cost-plus-fixed-fee 
contract requiring only that the contractor use its best efforts to 
perform a task, and a firm-fixed-price contract for a complex item. A 
cost-plus-fixed-fee contract would reflect a minimum assumption of cost 
responsibility by the contractor, whereas a firm-fixed-price contract 
would reflect a complete assumption of cost responsibility by the 
contractor. Therefore, in the first step of determining the value given 
for the contractor's assumption of contract cost risk, a lower rating 
would be assigned to a proposed cost-plus-fixed-fee best efforts 
contract, and a higher rating would be assigned to a firm-fixed-price 
contract.
    (iii) The second determination is that of the reliability of the 
cost estimates. Sound price negotiation requires well-defined contract 
objectives and reliable cost estimates. An excessive cost estimate 
reduces the possibility that the cost of performance will exceed the 
contract price, thereby reducing the contractor's assumption of contract 
cost risk.
    (iv) The third determination is that of the difficulty of the 
contractor's task. The contractor's task may be difficult or easy, 
regardless of the type of contract.
    (v) Contractors are likely to assume greater cost risks only if the 
contracting officer objectively analyzes the risk incident to the 
proposed contract, and is willing to compensate contractors for it. 
Generally, a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract would not justify a reward for 
risk in excess of 1 percent, nor would a firm-fixed-price contract 
normally justify a reward of less than 4 percent. Where proper contract 
type selection has been made, the reward for risk by contract type would 
usually fall into the following percentage ranges:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
              Type of contract                    Percentage ranges
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cost-plus-fixed-fee........................  0 to 1.
Prospective price determination............  4 to 5.
Firm-fixed-price...........................  4 to 6.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (A) These ranges may not be appropriate for all acquisitions. The 
contracting officer might determine that a basis exists for high 
confidence in the reasonableness of the estimate, and that little 
opportunity exists for cost reduction without extraordinary efforts. The 
contractor's willingness to accept ceilings on their burden rates should 
be considered as a risk factor for cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts.

[[Page 30]]

    (B) In making a contract cost risk evaluation in an acquisition that 
involves definitization of a letter contract, consideration should be 
given to the effect on total contract cost risk as a result of partial 
performance under a letter contract. Under some circumstances, the total 
amount of cost risk may have been effectively reduced by the existence 
of a letter contract. Under other circumstances, it may be apparent that 
the contractor's cost risk remained substantially as great as though a 
letter contract had not been used. Where a contractor has begun work 
under an anticipatory cost letter, the risk assumed is greater than 
normal. To be equitable, the determination of a profit weight for 
application to the total of all recognized costs, both those incurred 
and those yet to be expended, must be made with consideration to all 
relevant circumstances, not just to the portion of costs incurred or 
percentage of work completed prior to definitization.


<R05>
Sec. 1515.404-472  Other methods.

    (a) Contracting officers may use methods other than those prescribed 
in 1515.404-470 for establishing profit or fee objectives under the 
following types of contracts and circumstances:
    (1) Architect-engineering contracts;
    (2) Personal service contracts;
    (3) Management contracts, e.g., for maintenance or operation of 
Government facilities;
    (4) Termination settlements;
    (5) Services under labor-hour and time and material contracts which 
provide for payment on an hourly, daily, or monthly basis, and where the 
contractor's contribution constitutes the furnishing of personnel.
    (6) Construction contracts; and
    (7) Cost-plus-award-fee contracts.
    (b) Generally, it is expected that such methods will:
    (1) Provide the contracting officer with a technique that will 
ensure consideration of the relative value of the appropriate profit 
factors described under ``Profit Factors,'' in FAR 15.404-4(d) and
    (2) Serve as a basis for documentation of the profit or fee 
objective.


<R05>
Sec. 1515.404-473  Limitations.

    (a) In addition to the limitations established by statute (see FAR 
15.404-4(b)(4)(i)), no administrative ceilings on profits or fees shall 
be established, except those identified in EPAAR (48 CFR) 1516.404-
273(b).
    (b) The contracting officer shall not consider any known 
subcontractor profit/fee as part of the basis for determining the 
contractor profit/fee.


<R05>
Sec. 1515.404-474  Waivers.

    Under unusual circumstances, the SCM may specifically waive the 
requirement for the use of the guidelines. Such exceptions shall be 
justified in writing, and authorized only in situations where the 
guidelines method is unsuitable.

Sec. 1515.408  Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.

    (a) In addition to those provisions and clauses prescribed in FAR 
15.408, when an exception to FAR 15.403-1 does not apply and no other 
means available can be used to ascertain whether a fair and reasonable 
price can be determined, the contracting officer may insert in 
negotiated solicitations the provisions at--
    (1) 1552.215-72 when requesting information other than cost or 
pricing data, for cost-reimbursable, level-of-effort-contracts. Use 
Alternate I for cost-reimbursable, level-of-effort contracts when the 
Government's requirement is for fully dedicated staff for a twelve month 
period(s) of performance and performance is on a Government facility; 
Alternate II for acquisitions for cost-reimbursable, level-of-effort 
contracts when the Government's requirement is for fully dedicated staff 
for a twelve month period(s) of performance and performance is not on a 
Government facility; and Alternate III if the Government's requirement 
is for the acquisition of supplies or equipment.

The contracting officer may make revisions, deletions, or additions to 
1552.215-72 and its Alternates I-III as needed to fit an individual 
acquisition, and
    (2) 1552.215-73, General Financial and Organizational Information.
    (b) If uncompensated overtime is proposed, the resultant contract 
shall include the provisions at FAR 52.237-10 and include the provision 
at 1552.215-74. The contracting officer may use provisions substantially 
the same as 1552.215-74 without requesting a deviation to the EPAAR.

unsolicited proposals shall provide for the contractor to bear a portion 
of the cost of performance for work subject to the Act. The extent of 
the cost sharing shall reflect the mutuality of interest of the 
contractor and the Government. Therefore, where there is no measurable 
gain to the performing organization, cost sharing is not required.

Sec. 1516.301-70  Payment of fee.

    The policy of EPA for cost-reimbursement, term form contracts is to 
make provisional payment of fee (i.e. the fixed fee on cost-plus-fixed-
fee type contracts or the base fee on cost-plus-award-fee type 
contracts) on a percentage of work completed basis, when such a method 
will not prove detrimental to proper contract performance. Percentage of 
work completed is the ratio of the direct labor hours performed in 
relation to the direct labor hours set forth in the contract in clause 
1552.212-70, ``Level of Effort--Cost Reimbursement Term Contract.'' 
Provisional payment of fee will remain subject to

Sec. 1516.303  Cost-sharing contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 1516.303-71  Definition.

    Cost-sharing is a generic term denoting any situation where the 
Government does not fully reimburse a contractor for all allowable costs 
necessary to accomplish the project under the contract. This term 
encompasses cost-matching and cost-limitations, in addition to cost-
sharing. Cost-sharing does not include usual contractual limitations 
such as indirect cost ceilings in accordance with FAR 42.707, or 
ceilings on travel or other direct costs. Cost-sharing contracts may be 
required as a result of Congressional mandate.

[61 FR 14504, Apr. 2, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1516.303-72  Policy.

    (a) The Agency shall use cost-sharing contracts where the principal 
purpose is ultimate commercialization and utilization of technologies by 
the private sector. There should also be a reasonable expectation of 
future economic benefits for the contractor and the Government beyond 
the Government's contract.
    (b) Cost-sharing may be accomplished by a contribution to either 
direct or indirect costs, provided such costs are reasonable, allocable 
and allowable in accordance with the cost principles of the contract. 
Allowable costs which are absorbed by the contractor as its share of 
contract costs may not be charged directly or indirectly to the Agency 
or the Federal Government.
    (c) Unsolicited proposals will be considered on a case-by-case basis 
by the Contracting Officer as to the appropriateness of cost-sharing.

[61 FR 14504, Apr. 2, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1516.303-73  Types of cost-sharing.

    (a) Cost-sharing may be accomplished in various forms or 
combinations. These include, but are not limited to: cash outlays, real 
property or interest therein, personal property or services, cost 
matching, or other in-kind contributions.
    (b) In-kind contributions represent non-cash contributions provided 
by the performing contractor which would normally be a charge against 
the contract. While in-kind contributions are an acceptable method of 
cost-sharing, should the booked costs of property appear unrealistic, 
the fair market value of the property shall be determined pursuant to 
1516.303-74 of this chapter.
    (c) In-kind contributions may be in the form of personal property 
(equipment or supplies) or services which are directly beneficial, 
specifically identifiable and necessary for the performance of the 
contract. In-kind contributions must meet all of the following criteria 
before acceptance.
    (1) Be verifiable from the contractor's books and records;
    (2) Not be included as contributions under any other Federal 
contract;
    (3) Be necessary to accomplish project objectives;
    (4) Provide for types of charges that would otherwise be allowable 
under applicable Federal cost principles appropriate to the contractor's 
organization; and
    (5) Not be paid for by the Federal Government under any contract, 
agreement or grant.

[61 FR 14504, Apr. 2, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1516.303-74  Determining the value of in-kind contributions.

    In-kind contributions accepted from a contractor will be addressed 
on a case-by-case basis provided the established values do not exceed 
fair market values.
    (a) Where the Agency receives title to donated land, building, 
equipment or supplies and the property is not fully consumed during 
performance of the contract, the Contracting Officer should establish 
the property's value based on the contractor's booked costs (i.e., 
acquisition cost less depreciation, if any) at the time of donation. If 
the booked costs reflect unrealistic values when compared to current 
market conditions, the Contracting Officer may establish another 
appropriate value if supported by an independent appraisal of the fair 
market value of the donated property or property in similar condition 
and circumstances.

[[Page 33]]

    (b) The Contracting Officer will monitor reports of in-kind costs as 
they are incurred or recognized during the contract period of 
performance to determine that the value of in-kind services does not 
exceed fair market values.
    (c) The value of any services or the use of personal or real 
property donated by a contractor should be established when necessary in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting policies and Federal cost 
principles.

<R05>
Sec. 1516.303-75  Amount of cost-sharing.

    (a) Contractors should contribute a reasonable amount of the total 
project cost covered under the contract. The ratio of cost participation 
should correlate to the apparent advantages available to performers and 
the proximity of implementing commercialization, i.e., the higher the 
potential for future profits, the higher the contractor's share should 
be.
    (b) Fee will not be paid to the contractor or any member of the 
contractor team (subcontractors and consultants) which has a substantial 
and direct interest in the contract, or is in a position to gain long 
term benefits from the contract. A vulnerability the Contracting Officer 
should consider in reviewing a prime contractor's request for consent to 
subcontract is whether subcontractors under prime cost-sharing contracts 
have a significant direct interest in the contract to gain long-term 
benefits from the contract.
    (c) The Contracting Officer, with the input of technical experts, 
may consider the following factors in determining reasonable levels of 
cost sharing:
    (1) The availability of the technology to competitors;
    (2) Improvements in the contractor's market share position;
    (3) The time and risk necessary to achieve success;
    (4) If the results of the project involve patent rights which could 
be sold or licensed;
    (5) If the contractor has non-Federal sources of funds to include as 
cost participation; and
    (6) If the contractor has the production and other capabilities to 
capitalize the results of the project.
    (d) A contractor's cost participation can be provided by other 
subcontractors with which it has contractual arrangements to perform the 
contract as long as the contractor's cost-sharing goal is met.

Sec. 1516.303-76  Fee on cost-sharing contracts by subcontractors.

    (a) Subcontractors under prime cost-sharing contracts who do not 
have a significant direct interest in the contract or who are not in a 
position to gain long-term benefits from the contract may earn a fee.
    (b) Contracting Officers should be alert to a potential 
vulnerability for the Government under cost-sharing contracts when 
evaluating proposed subcontractors or consenting to a subcontract during 
contract administration, where the subcontractor is a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of the prime. The vulnerability consists of the subsidiary 
earning a large amount of fee, which could be returned to the prime 
through stock dividends or other intercompany transactions. This could 
circumvent the objective of a cost-sharing contract.

contract award shall indicate the total estimated cost of the contract, 
the Contractor's share of the cost, and the Government's share of the 
cost.
    (b) The manner of cost-sharing and how it is to be accomplished 
shall be set forth in the contract. Additionally, contracts which 
provide for cost-sharing shall require the contractor to maintain 
records adequate to reflect the nature and extent of their cost-sharing 
as well as those costs charged the Agency. Such records may be subject 
to an Agency audit.

ensuring proper contract performance.
    (c) The Contracting Officer shall insert a clause substantially the 
same as 48 CFR 1552.216-76, Estimated Cost and Cost-Sharing, in 
solicitations and contracts where the total incurred costs are shared by 
the contractor on a straight percentage basis. The Contracting Officer 
may develop other clauses, as appropriate, following the same approach, 
but reflecting different cost-sharing arrangements negotiated on 
specific contract actions.

<R05>
Sec. 1516.603  Letter Contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 1516.603-1  What is a Notice to Proceed?

    (a) A Notice to Proceed (NTP) is a type of letter contract issued 
pursuant to FAR 16.603 under which an EPA Federal Classification Series 
1102 (FCS) contracting officer or a duly authorized EPA on-scene 
coordinator with delegated procurement authority may initiate, in 
certain defined situations and subject to certain limitations and 
conditions, contracting actions to respond to certain situations as 
described in CERCLA section 104(a)(1) (42 U.S.C. 9604(a)(1)) and the 
Clean Water Act sections 311(c)(2) and (e)(1)(B) (33 U.S.C. 1321(c)(2) 
and (e)(1)(B)). An NTP may be utilized as a contractual instrument for 
certain--
    (1) Actions that EPA is authorized to undertake under CERCLA section 
104(a)(1), 42 U.S.C. 9604(a)(1), and the National Oil and Hazardous 
Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (40 CFR part 300), to respond to 
situations where any hazardous substance has been released or there is a 
substantial threat of such a release into the environment, or there is a 
release or substantial threat of release into the environment of any 
pollutant or contaminant which may present an imminent and substantial 
danger to the public health or welfare, and
    (2) Actions that EPA is authorized to undertake under sections 
311(c)(2) and (e)(1)(B) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1321(c)(2) and 
(e)(1)(B), and the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution 
Contingency Plan (40 CFR part 300), to respond when there is a 
discharge, or a substantial threat of a discharge (to or upon navigable 
waters, adjoining shorelines, the contiguous zone, or natural resources 
belonging to, appertaining to, or under the exclusive management of the 
United States), of oil or a hazardous substance from a vessel, onshore 
facility, or offshore facility that is a substantial threat to the 
public health or welfare. Pursuant to a class Justification For Other 
Than Full and Open Competition executed under the authority of FAR 
6.302-2 and 6.303-1(c), an NTP may be issued on a non-competitive basis.
    (b) What do subsections 1516.603-1 and 1516.603-2 cover? EPAAR 
1516.603-1 and 1516.603-2 contain information and procedures relating to 
issuance and definitization of an NTP. An NTP is subject to, and must 
comply with, the applicable requirements for letter contracts in FAR 
16.603 and the requirements in this section, and be definitized by an 
EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer.

[66 FR 12900, Mar. 1, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 1516.603-2  What are the requirements for use of an NTP?

    (a) An EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer or a duly authorized EPA on-
scene coordinator with a delegation of procurement authority may issue 
an NTP so long as it does not exceed the limits of his or her 
procurement authority and only when all of the following conditions have 
been met:
    (1) A written determination has been made by the Federal on-scene 
coordinator that--
    (i) As authorized by and consistent with CERCLA section 104(a)(1), 
42 U.S.C. 9604(a)(1), and the National Oil and Hazardous Substances 
Pollution Contingency Plan (40 CFR part 300), the EPA must take action 
to respond to a hazardous substance release or substantial threat of 
such a release into the environment, or a release or substantial threat 
of a release into the environment of any pollutant or contaminant which 
may present an imminent and substantial danger to the public health or 
welfare, or

[[Page 36]]

    (ii) As authorized by and consistent with the Clean Water Act 
sections 311(c)(2) and (e)(1)(B), 33 U.S.C. 1321(c)(2) and (e)(1)(B), 
and the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan 
(40 CFR part 300), the EPA must take action to respond to a discharge, 
or a substantial threat of a discharge (to or upon navigable waters, 
adjoining shorelines, the contiguous zone, or natural resources 
belonging to, appertaining to, or under the exclusive management of the 
United States), of oil or a hazardous substance from a vessel, offshore 
facility, or onshore facility that is of such a size and character as to 
pose a substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the United 
States; and
    (2) Before a duly authorized EPA on-scene coordinator with a 
delegation of procurement authority may issue an NTP, he or she must 
confirm that an EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer is not available to 
provide the required contracting support by the time the Federal on-
scene coordinator requires the response action to be undertaken; and
    (3) A written determination is made by an EPA FCS 1102 contracting 
officer or a duly authorized EPA on-scene coordinator with a delegation 
of procurement authority that there is no other existing contracting 
mechanism available to provide the required contracting support by the 
time required, including the inability of an existing emergency response 
contractor or other existing contract vehicle to respond in the required 
time frame. These conditions, as well as any other requirements 
applicable to NTPs or letter contracts contained in the FAR or EPAAR , 
must be met before an NTP can be issued by an EPA FCS 1102 contracting 
officer or a duly authorized EPA on-scene coordinator with a delegation 
of procurement authority.
    (b) What should be included in an NTP? (1) Since an NTP is a type of 
letter contract, it is subject to the requirements of FAR 16.603. All of 
the relevant requirements of FAR 16.603 apply to NTP's including FAR 
16.603-2, 16.603-3, and 16.603-4, and an NTP will include all 
appropriate FAR and EPAAR contract clauses. An NTP should also include 
an overall price ceiling and be as complete and definite as possible 
under the circumstances. To the extent NTPs require modification of any 
FAR or EPAAR prescribed procedures or clauses, an appropriate FAR or 
EPAAR deviation will be prepared.
    (2) The EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer or duly authorized EPA on-
scene coordinator with a delegation of procurement authority shall 
include in each NTP the clauses required by the FAR or EPAAR for the 
type of definitive contract contemplated and any additional clauses 
known to be appropriate for it. In addition, the following clauses must 
be inserted in the solicitation (if one is issued) and the NTP when an 
NTP is used:
    (i) The clause at FAR 52.216-23, Execution and Commencement of Work, 
except that the term on-scene coordinator may be used in place of the 
term contracting officer;
    (ii) The clause at FAR 52.216-24, Limitation of Government 
Liability, with dollar amounts completed in a manner consistent with FAR 
16.603-2(d); and
    (iii) The clause at FAR 52.216-25, Contract Definitization, with its 
paragraph (b) completed in a manner consistent with FAR 16.603-2(c) or 
any applicable FAR deviation. The clause at FAR 52.216-26, Payment of 
Allowable Costs Before Definitization, shall also be included in a 
solicitation (if one is issued) and NTPs if a cost-reimbursement 
definitive contract is contemplated.
    (3) Each NTP shall, as required by the clause at FAR 52.216-25, 
Contract Definitization, contain a negotiated definitization schedule 
that includes:
    (i) Dates for submission of the contractor's price proposal, 
required cost and pricing data, and if required, make-or-buy and 
subcontracting plans;
    (ii) The date for the start of negotiations; and
    (iii) A target date for definitization which shall be the earliest 
practicable date for definitization (an NTP must be definitized by an 
EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer). The schedule will provide for 
definitization of the NTP within 90 calendar days after the date of the 
NTP award. However, the EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer may, in extreme 
cases and according to agency

[[Page 37]]

procedures, authorize an additional period. If, after exhausting all 
reasonable efforts, the EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer and the 
contractor cannot negotiate a definitive contract because of failure to 
reach agreement as to price or fee, the clause at 52.216-25 requires the 
contractor to proceed with the work and provides that the contracting 
officer may, with the approval of the head of the contracting activity, 
determine a reasonable price or fee in accordance with subpart 15.4 and 
part 31 of the FAR, subject to appeal as provided in the Disputes 
clause.
    (4) The maximum liability of the Government inserted in the clause 
at 52.216-24, Limitation of Government Liability, shall, as approved by 
the official who authorized the NTP, be the estimated amount necessary 
to cover the contractor's requirements for funds to complete the work to 
be performed under the NTP. However, it shall not exceed the estimated 
cost of the definitive contract.
    (c) Are there any financial or monetary limitations on the use of an 
NTP? In addition to the requirements for issuance of an NTP set forth 
elsewhere in this subpart--
    (1) The total definitized dollar value of an individual NTP shall 
not exceed $200,000.00, and
    (2) The applicable Program Office must commit and make available 
appropriate funding for the emergency response action taken under the 
NTP prior to NTP issuance.
    (d) Are there any other procedural requirements for issuance of an 
NTP? An NTP must be issued in writing by the EPA FCS 1102 contracting 
officer or the duly authorized EPA on-scene coordinator with a 
delegation of procurement authority using a Standard Form 33. In 
addition, the EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer or the EPA on-scene 
coordinator awarding the NTP must ensure that the NTP complies with all 
applicable requirements for letter contracts set forth in the FAR and 
the requirements of this section, includes all relevant provisions and 
clauses, and that all actual or potential conflict of interest or other 
contracting issues are identified and resolved prior to NTP issuance. To 
assist the EPA on-scene coordinator and EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer 
in their responsibilities regarding NTP award, an NTP checklist will be 
completed by the EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer or EPA on-scene 
coordinator prior to issuance of the NTP.
    (e) What happens after an NTP is awarded to a contractor? (1) If an 
NTP is issued by a duly authorized EPA on-scene coordinator with a 
delegation of procurement authority, he or she must notify the cognizant 
EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer of the NTP award, and provide the NTP 
checklist to the contracting officer, as soon as possible but in no 
event later than the next working day after NTP issuance.
    (2) Within 5 working days of the EPA on-scene coordinator's award of 
an NTP, the on-scene coordinator shall provide to the cognizant EPA FCS 
1102 contracting officer all NTP documents, materials, and information 
necessary for the contracting officer to definitize the contract, and 
should retain a copy for his/her records. An EPA FCS 1102 contracting 
officer will be responsible for definitization of the NTP consistent 
with the definitization procedures set forth in this subpart. During the 
process of definitizing the NTP, the EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer 
will send the contractor the ``Representations, Certifications, and 
Other Statements of Offerors'' for completion. The contractor will 
complete this information, and any other required information, and 
submit it to the EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer prior to 
definitization of the NTP.
    (f) The CCO, who is authorized by EPAAR 1516.603-3 to make the 
determination to use a letter contract, shall make a class determination 
and findings authorizing EPA FCS 1102 contracting officers and duly 
authorized EPA on-scene coordinators with delegations of procurement 
authority to award NTPs pursuant to the conditions set forth in this 
subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 1517.207  Exercise of options.

    (a) Unless otherwise approved by the Chief of the Contracting 
Office, contracts for services employing option periods shall require 
that a preliminary written notice of the Government's intention to 
exercise the option be furnished to the Contractor a minimum of sixty 
(60) calendar days prior to the date for the exercise of the option. 
Failure to provide such preliminary notice within the timeframe 
established in the contract waives the Government's right to 
unilaterally exercise the option and requires the negotiation of a 
bilateral contract modification in order to extend the period of 
performance, where such an extension is authorized.
    (b) When the term of the service contract coincides with the fiscal 
year and delays in receipt of authority to obligate funds for the new 
fiscal year are anticipated, the Contracting Officer, if the contract so 
provides (see FAR 17.204(d)), may, within 60 days after the end of the 
fiscal year, unilaterally exercise an option to extend the term of the 
contract. The option may be exercised only if funds become available 
within the 60-day period. In the event that sufficient funding is not 
available within the 60 day period, the Government waives the right to 
exercise the option, thereby rendering any additional requirements 
subject to full and open competition requirements.
    (c) The Contracting Officer, if the contract so provides, may, 
subject to the conditions in FAR 17.204(d), 32.703-2, and 32.705-1(a), 
exercise an option contingent upon the availability of funds. To 
exercise such an option, the contract must contain the clause in FAR 
52.232-18, Availability of Funds. Under no circumstances shall any 
action be taken which could be construed as creating a legal liability 
on the part of the Government until a formal notice of availability of 
funds in the form of a contract modification has been issued by the 
Contracting Officer.

activities, receives technical guidance from the Director, OSDBU. The 
appointing authorities are the Chiefs of the Contracting Offices.
    (b) A copy of each appointment and termination of all SBS 
specialists shall be forwarded to the Director, OSDBU. In addition to 
performing the duties outlined in paragraph (c) of this section that are

perform such additional functions as may be prescribed from time to time 
in furtherance of overall small and

[[Page 40]]

small disadvantaged business utilization program goals. The SBS may be 
appointed on either a full- or part-time basis; however, when appointed 
on a part-time basis, the small business duty shall take precedence over 
collateral responsibilities.

shall perform the following duties as appropriate:
    (1) Maintain a program designed to locate capable small business 
sources for current and future acquisitions;

small disadvantaged business concerns on acquisition matters;
    (3) Review all proposed solicitations in excess of the simplified 
acquisition threshold, assure that small business concerns will be 
afforded an equitable opportunity to compete, and, as appropriate, 
initiate recommendations for small business set-asides, or offers of 
requirements to the SBA for the 8(a) program, and complete EPA Form 
1900-37, ``Record of Procurement Request Review,'' as appropriate:
    (4) Take action to assure the availability of adequate 
specifications and drawings, when necessary, to obtain small business 
participation in an acquisition. When small business concerns cannot be 
given an opportunity on a current acquisition, initiate action, in 
writing, with appropriate technical and contracting personnel to ensure 
that necessary specifications and/or drawings for future acquisitions 
are available.
    (5) Review proposed contracts for possible breakout of items or 
services suitable for acquisition from small business and small 
disadvantaged business concerns;
    (6) Advise small businesses with respect to the financial assistance 
available under existing laws and regulations and assist such concerns 
in applying for financial assistance;
    (7) Participate in the evaluation of a prime contractor's small 
business subcontracting programs;
    (8) Assure that adequate records are maintained, and accurate 
reports prepared, concerning small business participation in acquisition 
programs (see 1519.202-5);
    (9) Make available to SBA copies of solicitations when so requested;
    (10) Act as liaison with the appropriate SBA office or 
representative in connection with set-asides, certificates of 
competency, size classification, and any other matter concerning the 
small or small disadvantaged business programs.

    Source: 61 FR 14506, Apr. 2, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1523.7000  Background.

    (a) Executive Order 12845 requires the Federal Government to 
purchase only microcomputers, including personal computers, monitors and 
printers, which meet ``EPA Energy Star'' requirements for energy 
efficiency. This equipment is often identified by the Energy 
Star<SUP>TM</SUP> logo and is capable of entering and recovering from an 
energy-efficient low power state.
    (b) The EPA Energy Star Computer Program is a voluntary partnership 
effort with the computer industry to promote the introduction of energy-
efficient personal computers, monitors, and printers which can reduce 
air pollution caused by utility power generation, and ease the burden on 
building air conditioning and electrical systems. The Energy Star 
Program is designed to be a self-certifying computer industry program, 
policed informally by the computer industry itself.
    (c) FIRMR Bulletin C-35 (dated 11/19/93) describes procedures that 
will promote the acquisition of energy-efficient microcomputers and 
associated computer equipment.


<R05>
Sec. 1523.7001  Policy.

    (a) The ``Energy Star'' Executive Order (E.O. 12845) applies to the 
following equipment:
    (1) Personal Computers (stand-alone).
    (2) Personal Computers (end-user on network).
    (3) Notebook and other portable computers.

[[Page 44]]

    (4) PC printers - laser, inkjet or dot matrix (stand-alone or 
networked).
    (5) High-speed printers used on a PC network (less than 
approximately 20 pages per minute).
    (6) Monitors (CRT or Flat-panel LCD).
    (b) ``Energy Star'' requirements do not apply to the following 
equipment:
    (1) Workstations.
    (2) File servers.
    (3) Mainframe equipment.
    (4) Minicomputers.
    (5) High-speed printers used with mainframe computers (30 or more 
pages per minute).
    (6) Mainframe or ``dumb'' terminals.
    (7) X-terminals.
    (c) All new acquisitions for microcomputers, including personal 
computers, monitors, and printers, shall contain specifications which 
meet EPA Energy Star requirements for energy efficiency unless a waiver 
has been obtained in accordance with internal Agency procedures. The EPA 
Energy Star requirement applies in instances where the Contracting 
Officer authorizes the contractor to acquire property in accordance with 
FAR 45.302-1.
    (d) The Energy Star requirement also applies to all applicable 
equipment ordered from GSA Schedule Contracts, open market buys, and 
Bankcard purchases.


<R05>
Sec. 1523.7002  Waivers.

    (a) There are several types of computer equipment which technically 
fall under the current Energy Star Program, but for which EPA 
established blanket waivers because Energy Star compliant versions of 
this equipment were unavailable in the marketplace. Blanket waivers 
apply to the following types of equipment:
    (1) LAN servers, including file servers; application servers; 
communication servers; including bridges and routers;
    (2) UNIX RISC based processors with their high-end monitors;
    (3) Large LAN printers (greater than 19 pages/minute output); and
    (4) Scientific computing equipment which is used for real-time data 
acquisition and which, if subjected to a power down mode, would 
jeopardize the research project.
    (b) It is anticipated that there will be Energy Star models of this 
equipment in the future, but in the near term EPA will not specify 
Energy Star qualifications when purchasing the items listed in this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 1523.7003  Contract clause.

    (a) Rehabilitation Act Notice.
    Contracting officers shall insert the clause at 1552.239-70, 
Rehabilitation Act Notice, or one substantially the same as this clause, 
in all solicitations and contracts where the contractor may be required 
to provide any type of support to EPA in connection with EPA programs 
and activities, including conferences, symposia, workgroups, meetings, 
etc.
    (b) The Contracting Officer shall insert a clause substantially the 
same as 48 CFR 1552.239-103, Acquisition of Energy Star Compliant 
Microcomputers, Including Personal Computers, Monitors, and Printers, in 
all solicitations and contracts for the acquisition of microcomputers, 
including personal computers, monitors and printers. The Contracting 
Officer shall also insert the clause in solicitations and contracts 
where the Contracting Officer authorizes the contractor to acquire 
property in accordance with FAR 45.302-1.

Sec. 1532.003  Simplified acquisition procedures financing.

    (a) Scope. This subpart provides for authorization of advance and 
interim payments on commercial item orders not exceeding the simplified 
acquisition threshold. Advance payments are payments that are made prior 
to performance. Interim payments are payments that are made during the 
order period according to a payment schedule.
    (b) Procedures for micropurchases. Contracting officers may 
authorize advance and interim payments on orders for commercial items 
only at or below the micropurchase threshold.
    (c) Procedures for purchases exceeding micropurchase threshold. 
Contracting officers must secure approval at one level above the 
contracting officer, on a case-by-case basis, for advance and interim 
payments on orders for commercial items exceeding the micropurchase 
threshold and not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. The 
contracting officer shall submit a recommendation for approval of 
financing terms, along with the supporting rationale for the action, to 
one level above the contracting officer. Remote simplified acquisition 
contracting officers (SACO) without one level above contracting officers 
at their locations shall forward recommendations through their OAM 
Advisors to secure one level above approval.
    (d) Supporting rationale. Regardless of dollar value, the 
contracting officer shall document the file with supporting rationale 
demonstrating that the purchase meets the conditions of FAR 32.202-
1(b)(1), (3) and (4).
    (e) Administration. Regardless of dollar value, the contracting 
officer is responsible for ensuring that supplies or services have been 
delivered. The contracting officer shall document the file with evidence 
of receipt of supplies or services throughout the order period as 
appropriate to the acquisition.
    (f) Clause. The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 
1552.232-74, Payments--Simplified Acquisition Procedures Financing, in 
solicitations and

offices in preparing and executing agreements to recognize a change of 
name or successor in interest, only one supplemental agreement will be 
prepared to effect necessary changes for all contracts between EPA and 
the Contractor involved. The Chief of the Procurement Policy Branch,

designate the Contracting Office responsible for taking all necessary 
and appropriate action with respect to either recognizing or not 
recognizing a successor in interest, or recognizing a change of name

Sec. 1552.208-70  Printing.

    As prescribed in 1508.870, insert the following clause:

[[Page 59]]

                           Printing (DEC 2005)

    (a) Definitions.
    ``Printing'' is the process of composition, plate making, presswork, 
binding and microform; or the end items produced by such processes and 
equipment. Printing services include newsletter production and 
periodicals which are prohibited under EPA contracts.
    ``Composition'' applies to the setting of type by hot-metal casting, 
photo typesetting, or electronic character generating devices for the 
purpose of producing camera copy, negatives, a plate or image to be used 
in the production of printing or microform.
    ``Camera copy'' (or ``camera-ready copy'') is a final document 
suitable for printing/duplication.
    ``Desktop Publishing'' is a method of composition using computers 
with the final output or generation of camera copy done by a color 
inkjet or color laser printer. This is not considered ``printing.'' 
However, if the output from desktop publishing is being sent to a 
typesetting device (i.e., Linotronic) with camera copy being produced in 
either paper or negative format, these services are considered 
``printing''.
    ``Microform'' is any product produced in a miniaturized image 
format, for mass or general distribution and as a substitute for 
conventionally printed material. Microform services are classified as 
printing services and includes microfiche and microfilm. The contractor 
may make up to two sets of microform files for archival purposes at the 
end of the contract period of performance.
    ``Duplication'' means the making of copies on photocopy machines 
employing electrostatic, thermal, or other processes without using an 
intermediary such as a negative or plate.
    ``Requirement'' means an individual photocopying task. (There may be 
multiple requirements under a Work Assignment or Delivery Order. Each 
requirement would be subject to the photocopying limitation of 5,000 
copies of one page or 25,000 copies of multiple pages in the aggregate 
per requirement).
    ``Incidental'' means a draft and/or proofed document (not a final 
document) that is not prohibited from printing under EPA contracts.
    (b) Prohibition. (1) The contractor shall not engage in, nor 
subcontract for, any printing in connection with the performance of work 
under this contract. Duplication of more than 5,000 copies of one page 
or more than 25,000 copies of multiple pages in the aggregate per 
requirement constitutes printing. The intent of the printing limitation 
is to eliminate duplication of final documents.
    (2) In compliance with EPA Order 2200.4a, EPA Publication Review 
Procedure, the Office of Communications, Education, and Media Relations 
is responsible for the review of materials generated under a contract 
published or issued by the Agency under a contract intended for release 
to the public.
    (c) Affirmative Requirements. (1) Unless otherwise directed by the 
contracting officer, the contractor shall use double-sided copying to 
produce any progress report, draft report or final report.
    (2) Unless otherwise directed by the contracting officer, the 
contractor shall use recycled paper for reports delivered to the Agency 
which meet the minimum content standards for paper and paper products as 
set forth in EPA's Web site for the Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines 
at: http://www.epa.gov/cpg/.
    (d) Permitted Contractor Activities. (1) The prohibitions contained 
in paragraph (b) do not preclude writing, editing, or preparing 
manuscript copy, or preparing related illustrative material to a final 
document (camera-ready copy) using desktop publishing.
    (2) The contractor may perform a requirement involving the 
duplication of less than 5,000 copies of only one page, or less than 
25,000 copies of multiple pages in the aggregate, using one color 
(black), such pages shall not exceed the maximum image size of 10\3/4\ 
by 14\1/4\ inches, or 11 by 17 paper stock. Duplication services below 
these thresholds are not considered printing. If performance of the 
contract will require duplication in excess of these thresholds, 
contractors must immediately notify the contracting officer in writing. 
The contracting officer must obtain a waiver from the U.S. Congress 
Joint Committee on Printing if it is deemed appropriate to exceed the 
duplication thresholds. Duplication services of ``incidentals'' in 
excess of the thresholds, are allowable.
    (3) The contractor may perform a requirement involving the multi-
color duplication of no more than 100 pages in the aggregate using color 
copier technology, such pages shall not exceed the maximum image size of 
10\3/4\ by 14\1/4\ inches, or 11 by 17 paper stock. Duplication services 
below these thresholds are not considered printing. If performance of 
the contract will require duplication in excess of these limits, 
contractors must immediately notify the contracting officer in writing. 
The contracting officer must obtain a waiver from the U.S. Congress 
Joint Committee on Printing.
    (4) The contractor may perform the duplication of no more than a 
total of 100 diskettes or CD-ROM's. Duplication services below these 
thresholds are not considered printing. If performance of the contract 
will require duplication in excess of these thresholds, contractors must 
immediately notify the contracting officer in writing. The contracting 
officer must obtain a waiver from the U.S. Congress Joint Committee on 
Printing.

[[Page 60]]

    (e) Violations. The contractor may not engage in, nor subcontract 
for, any printing in connection with the performance of work under the 
contract. The cost of any printing services in violation of this clause 
will be disallowed, or not accepted by the Government.
    (f) Flowdown Provision. The contractor shall include in each 
subcontract which may involve a requirement for any printing/
duplicating/copying a provision substantially the same as this clause.

Sec. 1552.209-70  Organizational conflict of interest notification.

provision in all solicitations.

       Organizational Conflict of Interest Notification (APR 1984)

    (a) The prospective Contractor certifies, to the best of its 
knowledge and belief, that it is not aware of any information bearing on 
the existence of any potential organizational conflict of interest. If 
the prospective Contractor cannot so certify, it shall provide a 
disclosure statement in its proposal which describes all relevant 
information concerning any past, present, or planned interests bearing 
on whether it (including its chief executives and directors, or any 
proposed consultant or subcontractor) may have a potential 
organizational conflict of interest.
    (b) Prospective Contractors should refer to FAR subpart 9.5 and 
EPAAR part 1509 for policies and procedures for avoiding, neutralizing, 
or mitigating organizational conflicts of interest.
    (c) If the Contracting Officer determines that a potential conflict 
exists, the prospective Contractor shall not receive an award unless the 
conflict can be avoided or otherwise resolved through the inclusion of a 
special contract clause or other appropriate means. The terms of any 
special clause are subject to negotiation.

<R05>
Sec. 1552.209-71  Organizational conflicts of interest.

    As prescribed in 1509.507-2, insert the following contract clause in 
all contracts except:
    (a) When specific clauses are required per EPAAR part 1509;
    (b) When the procurement is with another Federal agency (however, 
the provision is included in contracts with SBA and its subcontractor 
under the 8(a) program); and
    (c) When the procurement is accomplished through simplified 
acquisition procedures, use of the clause is optional.

             Organizational Conflicts of Interest (MAY 1994)

    (a) The Contractor warrants that, to the best of the Contractor's 
knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which 
could give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in 
FAR subpart 9.5, or that the Contractor has disclosed all such relevant 
information.
    (b) Prior to commencement of any work, the Contractor agrees to 
notify the Contracting Officer immediately that, to the best of its 
knowledge and belief, no actual or potential conflict of interest exists 
or to identify to the Contracting Officer any actual or potential 
conflict of interest the firm may have. In emergency situations, 
however, work may begin but notification shall be made within five (5) 
working days.
    (c) The Contractor agrees that if an actual or potential 
organizational conflict of interest is identified during performance, 
the Contractor will immediately make a full disclosure in writing to the 
Contracting Officer. This disclosure shall include a description of 
actions which the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after 
consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or 
neutralize the actual or potential conflict of interest. The Contractor 
shall continue performance until notified by the Contracting Officer of 
any contrary action to be taken.
    (d) Remedies--The EPA may terminate this contract for convenience, 
in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid an 
organizational conflict of interest. If the Contractor was aware of a 
potential organizational conflict of interest prior to award or 
discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not 
disclose it or misprepresented relevant information to the Contracting 
officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, debar 
the Contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other 
remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.
    (e) The Contractor agrees to insert in each subcontract or 
consultant agreement placed hereunder, except for subcontracts or 
consultant agreements for well drilling, fence erecting, plumbing,

performed work for EPA under this contract; or (2) any work that may 
jeopardize CERCLA enforcement actions which pertain to the site where 
the Contractor previously performed work for the EPA under this 
contract.
    (d) During the life of this contract, including any options, the 
Contractor agrees that unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting 
Officer:
    (1) It will not provide any Superfund Technical Assistance and 
Removal Team (START) type activities (e.g., START contracts) to EPA on 
the site either as a prime contractor, subcontractor, or consultant.
    (2) It will be ineligible for award of contracts pertaining to this 
site which result from a CERCLA administrative order, a CERCLA or RCRA 
consent decree or a court order.
    (e) The Contractor and any subcontractors, during the life of this 
contract, shall be ineligible to enter into an EPA contract or a 
subcontract under an EPA contract, which supports EPA's performance of 
Superfund Headquarters policy work including support for the analysis 
and development of regulations, policies, or guidance that govern, 
affect, or relate to the conduct of response action activities, unless 
otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer. Examples of such 
contracts include, but are not limited to, Superfund Management and 
Analytical support contracts, and Superfund Technical and Analytical 
support contracts.
    (f) The Contractor agrees in advance that if any bids/proposals are 
submitted for any work that would require written approval of the 
Contracting Officer prior to entering into a contract subject to the 
restrictions of this clause, then the bids/proposals are submitted at 
the Contractor's own risk. Therefore, no claim shall be made against the 
Government to recover bid/proposal costs as a direct cost whether the 
request for authorization to enter into the contract is denied or 
approved.
    (g) To the extent that the work under this contract requires access 
to proprietary or confidential business or financial data of other 
companies, and as long as such data remains proprietary or confidential, 
the Contractor shall protect such data from unauthorized use and 
disclosure.
    (h) Contractors who are performing nondiscretionary technical or 
engineering services, including construction work, may request a waiver 
from or modification to this clause by submitting a written request to 
the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer shall make the 
determination regarding whether to waive or modify the clause on a case-
by-case basis.
    (i) The Contractor agrees to insert in each subcontract or 
consultant agreement placed hereunder, except for subcontracts or 
consultant agreements for nondiscretionary technical or engineering 
services, including treatability studies, well drilling, fence erecting, 
plumbing, utility hookups, security guard services, or electrical 
services, provisions which shall conform substantially to the language 
of this clause, including this paragraph (i) unless otherwise authorized 
by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor may request in writing that 
the Contracting Officer exempt from this clause a particular subcontract 
or consultant agreement for nondiscretionary technical or engineering 
services not specifically listed above, including laboratory analysis. 
The Contracting Officer will review and evaluate each request on a case-
by-case basis before approving or disapproving the request.
    (j) If the Contractor seeks an expedited decision regarding its 
initial future contracting request, the Contractor may submit its 
request to both the Contracting Officer and the next administrative 
level within the Contracting Officer's organization.
    (k) A review process available to the Contractor when an adverse 
determination is received shall consist of a request for reconsideration 
to the Contracting Officer or a request for review submitted to the next 
administrative level within the Contracting Officer's organization. An 
adverse determination resulting from a request for reconsideration by 
the Contracting Officer will not preclude the Contractor from requesting 
a review by the next administrative level. Either

[[Page 68]]

a request for review or a request for reconsideration must be submitted 
to the appropriate level within 30 calendar days after receipt of the 
initial adverse determination.

in cost-reimbursement term contracts including cost contracts without 
fee, cost-sharing contracts, cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contracts, cost-
plus-incentive-fee contracts (CPIF), and cost-plus-award-fee contracts 
(CPAF).

      Level of Effort--Cost-Reimbursement Term Contract (APR 1984)

    (a) The Contractor shall perform all work and provide all required 
reports within the level of effort specified below. The Government 
hereby orders ---- direct labor hours for the base period, which 
represents the Government's best estimate of the level of effort to 
fulfill these requirements.
    (b) Direct labor includes personnel such as engineers, scientists, 
draftsmen, technicians, statisticians, and programmers and not support 
personnel such as company management, typists, and key punch operators 
even though such support personnel are normally treated as direct labor 
by the Contractor. The level of effort specified in paragraph (a) 
includes Contractor, subcontractor, and consultant labor hours.
    (c) If the Contractor provides less than 90 percent of the level of 
effort specified for the base period or any optional period ordered, an 
equitable downward adjustment of the fixed fee, if any, for that period 
will be made. The Government may require the Contractor to provide 
additional effort up to 110 percent of the level of effort for any 
period until the estimated cost for that period has been reached. 
However, this additional effort shall not result in any increase in the 
fixed fee, if any. If this is a cost-plus-incentive-fee (CPIF) contract, 
the term ``fee'' in this paragraph means ``base fee and incentive fee.'' 
If this is a cost-plus-award-fee (CPAF) contract, the term ``fee'' in 
this paragraph means ``base fee and award fee.''
    (d) If the level of effort specified to be ordered during a given 
base or option period is not ordered during that period, that level of 
effort may not be acumulated and ordered during a subsequent period.
    (e) These terms and conditions do not supersede the requirements of 
either the ``Limitation of Cost'' or ``Limitation of Funds'' clauses.

in cost-reimbursement type term form contracts when work assignments are 
to be used.

                       Work Assignments (APR 1984)

    (a) The contractor shall perform work under this contract as 
specified in written work assignments issued by the Contracting Officer.
    (b) Each work assignment will include (1) a numerical designation, 
(2) the estimate of required labor hours, (3) the period of performance 
and schedule of deliverables, and (4) the description of the work.
    (c) The Contractor shall acknowledge receipt of each work assignment 
by returning to the Contracting Officer a signed copy of the work 
assignment within ---- calendar days after its receipt. The Contractor 
shall begin work immediately upon receipt of a work assignment. Within 
---- calendar days after receipt of a work assignment, the Contractor 
shall submit ---- copies of a work plan to the Project Officer and ---- 
copies to the Contracting Officer. The work plan shall include a 
detailed technical and staffing plan and a detailed cost estimate. 
Within ---- calendar days after receipt of the work plan, the 
Contracting Officer will provide written approval or disapproval of it 
to the Contractor. If the Contractor has not received approval on a work 
plan within ---- calendar days after its submission, the Contractor

[[Page 72]]

shall stop work on that work assignment. Also, if the Contracting 
Officer disapproves a work plan, the Contractor shall stop work until 
the problem causing the disapproval is resolved. In either case, the 
Contractor shall resume work only when the Contracting Officer finally 
approves the work plan.
    (d) This clause does not change the requirements of the ``Level of 
Effort'' clause, nor the notification requirements of either the 
``Limitation of Cost'' or ``Limitation of Funds'' clauses.
    (e) Work assignments shall not allow for any change to the terms or 
conditions of the contract. Where any language in the work assignment 
may suggest a change to the terms or conditions, the Contractor shall 
immediately notify the Contracting Officer.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I. As prescribed in 1512.104(b), modify the existing 
clause by adding the following paragraph (f) to the basic clause:

    (f) Within 20 days of receipt of the work assignment or similar 
tasking document, the Contractor shall provide a conflict of interest 
certification. Where work assignments or similar tasking documents are 
issued under this contract for work on or directly related to a site, 
the Contractor is only required to provide a conflict of interest 
certification for the first work assignment issued for that site. For 
all subsequent work on that site under this contract, the Contractor has 
a continuing obligation to search and report any actual or potential 
conflicts of interest, but no additional conflict of interest 
certifications are required.
    Before submitting the conflict of interest certification, the 
contractor shall search its records accumulated, at a minimum, over the 
past three years immediately prior to the receipt of the work assignment 
or similar tasking document. In the COI certification, the Contractor 
must certify to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, that 
all actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest have been 
reported to the Contracting Officer or that to the best of the 
Contractor's knowledge and belief, no actual or potential organizational 
conflicts of interest exist. In addition, the Contractor must certify 
that its personnel who perform work under this work assignment or 
relating to this work assignment have been informed of their obligation 
to report personal and organizational conflicts of interest to the 
Contractor. The certification shall also include a statement that the 
Contractor recognizes its continuing obligation to identify and report 
any actual or potential conflicts of interest arising during performance 
of this work assignment or other work related to this site.
    Alternate II. As prescribed in 1512.104(b), modify the existing 
clause by adding the following paragraph (f) to the basic clause:

    (f) Within 20 days of receipt of the work assignment or similar 
tasking document, the Contractor shall provide a conflict of interest 
certification. Where work assignments or similar tasking documents are 
issued under this contract for work on or directly related to a site, 
the Contractor is only required to provide a conflict of interest 
certification for the first work assignment issued for that site. For 
all subsequent work on that site under this contract, the Contractor has 
a continuing obligation to search and report any actual or potential 
conflicts of interest, but no additional conflict of interest 
certifications are required.
    Before submitting the conflict of interest certification, the 
contractor shall initially search through all of its available records 
to identify any actual or potential conflicts of interest. During the 
first three years of this contract, the contractor shall search through 
all records created since the beginning of the contract plus the records 
of the contractor prior to the award of the contract until a minimum of 
three years of records are accumulated. Once three years of records have 
accumulated, prior to certifying, the contractor shall search its 
records accumulated, at a minimum, over the past three years immediately 
prior to the receipt of the work assignment or similar tasking document. 
In the certification, the Contractor must certify to the best of the 
Contractor's knowledge and belief, that all actual or potential 
organizational conflicts of interest have been reported to the 
Contracting Officer or that to the best of the Contractor's knowledge 
and belief, no actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest 
exist. In addition, the Contractor must certify that its personnel who 
perform work under this work assignment or relating to this work 
assignment have been informed of their obligation to report personal and 
organizational conflicts of interest to the Contractor. The 
certification shall also include a statement that the Contractor 
recognizes its continuing obligation to identify and report any actual 
or potential conflicts of interest arising during performance of this 
work assignment or other work related to this site.

EPA Source Evaluation and Selection Procedures--Negotiated Procurements 
                               (AUG 1999)

    (a) The Government will perform source selection in accordance with 
FAR Part 15 and the EPA Source Evaluation and Selection Procedures in 
EPAAR Part 1515 (48 CFR Part 1515). The significant features of this 
procedure are:
    (1) The Government will perform either cost analysis or price 
analysis of the offeror's cost/business proposal in accordance with FAR 
Parts 15 and 31, as appropriate. In addition, the Government will also 
evaluate proposals to determine contract cost or price realism.
    Cost or price realism relates to an offeror's demonstrating that the 
proposed cost or price provides an adequate reflection of the offeror's 
understanding of the requirements of this solicitation, i.e., that the 
cost or price is not unrealistically low or unreasonably high.
    (2) The Government will evaluate technical proposals as specified in 
1552.215-71, Evaluation Factors for Award.
    (b) In addition to evaluation of the previously discussed elements, 
the Government will consider in any award decision the responsibility 
factors set forth in FAR Part 9.

    As prescribed in 1515.408(a)(1) insert the following provision:

        Instructions for the Preparation of Proposals (AUG 1999)

    (a) Other than cost proposal instructions.
    (1) Submit proposal for than cost factors as a separate part of the 
total proposal package. Omit all cost or pricing details from this 
proposal.
    (2) Special proposal instructions:

________________________________________________________________________

________________________________________________________________________

________________________________________________________________________

    (b) Cost or pricing proposal instructions. The offeror shall prepare 
and submit cost or pricing information data and supporting attachments 
in accordance with Table 15-2 of FAR 15.408. In addition to a hard copy 
of the information, to expedite review of the proposal, submit a 3.5'' 
high density IBM-compatible formatted computer disk containing the 
financial data required, if this information is available using a 
commercial spreadsheet program on a personal computer. Submit this 
information using LOTUS 1-2-3, if available. Identify which version of 
LOTUS used. If the offeror used another spreadsheet program, indicate 
the software program used to create this information. Offerors should 
include the formulas and factors used in calculating the financial data. 
Although submission of a computer disk will expedite review, failure to 
submit a disk will not affect consideration of the proposal.
    (1) General--Submit cost or pricing information prepared in 
accordance with FAR Table 15-2, Instructions for Submitting Cost/Price 
Proposals When Cost or Pricing Information Are Required and the 
following:
    (i) Clearly identify separate cost or pricing information associated 
with any:
    (A) Options to extend the term of the contract;
    (B) Options for the Government to order incremental quantities; and/
or
    (C) Major tasks, if required by the special instructions.
    (ii) If the contract schedule includes a ``Fixed Rate for Services'' 
clause, please provide in the cost proposal a schedule duplicating the 
format in the clause and include proposed fixed hourly rates per labor 
category for the base and any optional contract periods.
    (iii) If the contract includes the clause at EPAAR 1552.232-73 
``Payments--Fixed-Rate Services Contract,'' or the clause at FAR

[[Page 77]]

52.232-7, ``Payments Under Time and Materials and Labor-Hour 
Contracts,'' include in the cost proposal the estimated costs and burden 
rate to be applied to materials, other direct costs, or subcontracts. 
The Government will include these costs as part of its cost proposal 
evaluation.
    (iv) If other divisions, subsidiaries, a parent or affiliated 
companies will perform work, provide the name and location of such 
affiliate and offeror's intercompany pricing policy. Separately identify 
costs and supporting data for each entity proposed.
    (v) The realism of costs, including personnel compensation rates 
(including effective hourly rates due to uncompensated overtime) will be 
part of the proposal evaluation. Any reductions to proposed costs or 
differences between proposed and known EPA/DCAA recommended rates must 
be fully explained. If an offeror makes a reduction which makes its 
offer or portions of its offer below anticipated costs, the offeror 
shall identify where (i.e., which elements of costs) the proposed 
reductions will be made. Unsubstantiated rates may result in an upward 
or downward adjustment of the cost proposals to reflect more realistic 
costs. Based on this analysis, a projected cost for the offeror will be 
calculated to reflect the Government's estimate of the offeror's 
probable costs. Any inconsistency, whether real or apparent, between the 
promised performance and cost or price should be explained. The burden 
of proof for cost credibility rests with the offeror.
    (2) Direct Labor.
    (i) The direct technical labor hours (level-of-effort) appearing in 
the solicitation are for professional and technical labor only. These 
hours do not include management at a level higher than project 
management, e.g., corporate and day-to-day management, nor do they 
include clerical and support staff at a level lower than technician. If 
it is the offeror's normal practice to charge these types of costs as 
direct costs, include these costs along with an estimate of the directly 
chargeable labor-hours for these personnel. These direct charges are to 
be shown separately from the technical (level-of-effort) effort. If this 
type of effort is normally included in the offeror's indirect cost 
allocations, no estimate is required. However, direct charging of these 
on any resulting contract will not be allowed. Additionally the direct 
technical labor hours are the workable hours required by the Government 
and do not include release time (i.e., holidays, vacation, etc.) Submit 
the proposal utilizing the labor categories and distribution of the 
level-of-effort specified in the solicitation. These are approximate 
distribution levels and do not necessarily represent the actual levels 
which may be experienced during contract performance.
    (ii) Explain the basis of the proposed labor rates, including a 
complete justification for all judgmental factors used to develop 
weights applied to company's category or individual rates that comprise 
the rates for labor categories specified in the solicitation. This 
explanation should describe how technical approach coincides with the 
proposed costs. If the proposed direct labor rates are based on an 
average of the individuals proposed to work on the contract, provide a 
list of the individuals proposed and the hours associated with each 
individual in deriving the rates. If the proposed direct labor rates are 
based on an average of company category rates, identify and describe the 
labor categories and the percentages associated with each category in 
deriving the rates, explaining in detail the basis for the percentages 
assigned.
    (iii) Describe for each labor category proposed, the company's 
qualifications and experience requirements. If individual rates are 
used, provide the employee's name. If specific individuals are 
identified in the technical proposal, correlate these individuals with 
the labor categories specified in the solicitation.
    (iv) Provide a matrix summarizing the effort proposed, including the 
subcontracts, by professional and technical level specified in the 
solicitation.
    (v) Indicate whether current rates or escalated rates are used. If 
escalation is included, state the degree (percent) and methodology. The 
methodology shall include the effective date of the base rates and the 
policy on salary reviews (e.g. anniversary date of employee or salary 
reviews for all employees on a specific date).
    (vi) State whether any additional direct labor (new hire or 
temporary hires) will be required during the performance period of this 
acquisition. If so, state the number required, the professional or 
technical level and the methodology used to estimate proposed labor 
rates.
    (vii) With respect to educational institutions, include the 
following information for those professional staff members whose salary 
is expected to be covered by a stipulated salary support agreement 
pursuant to OMB Circular A-21.
    (A) Individual's name;
    (B) Annual salary and the period for which the salary is applicable;
    (C) List of other research Projects or proposals for which salaries 
are allocated, and the proportionate time charged to each; and
    (D) Other duties, such as teaching assignments, administrative 
assignments, and other institutional activities. Show the proportionate 
time charged to each. (Show proportionate time charges as a percentage 
of 100% of time for the entire academic year, exclusive of vacation or 
sabbatical leave.)

[[Page 78]]

    (viii) Uncompensated overtime. The decision to propose uncompensated 
overtime is the offeror's decision. Should the offeror, however, elect 
to propose uncompensated overtime, the offeror must propose a 
methodology that is consistent with their cost accounting practices and 
company policy. If proposed, provide an estimate of any uncompensated 
overtime proposed for exempt personnel working at the offeror's 
facilities. This estimate should identify the number of uncompensated 
labor hours and the percentage of compensated labor. Uncompensated labor 
hours are defined as hours for exempt personnel in excess of regular 
hours for a pay period which are actually worked and recorded in 
accordance with company policy. Provide a copy of the company policy on 
uncompensated overtime. Provide historical percentages of uncompensated 
overtime for the past three years. If proposed for subcontractors, 
provide separately with subcontractor information.
    (ix) For labor rate contracts, for each fixed labor rate, offerors 
shall identify the basis for the loaded fixed hourly rate for each 
contract period for example, the rate might consist of the following 
cost elements: raw wage or salary rate, plus fringe benefits (if 
applicable), plus overhead rate (if applicable), plus G&A expense rate 
(if applicable), plus profit.
    When determining the composite raw wage for a labor category, the 
offeror shall:
    (A) provide in narrative form the basis for the raw wage for each 
labor category. If actual wages of current employees are used, the basis 
for the projections should be explained.
    (B) If employees are subject to the Service Contract Act or Davis 
Bacon Act, they must be compensated at least at the minimum wage rate 
required by the applicable Wage Determination.
    (3) Indirect costs (fringe, overhead, general, and administrative 
expenses).
    (i) If the rates have been recently approved, include a copy of the 
rate agreement. If the agreement does not cover the projected 
performance period of the proposed effort, provide the rationale and any 
estimated rate calculations for the proposed performance period.
    (ii) Submit supporting documentation for rates which have not been 
approved or audited. Indicate whether computations are based upon 
historical or projected data.
    (iii) Provide actual pool expenses, base dollars, or hours (as 
applicable for the past five years). Include the actual indirect rates 
for the past five years including the indirect rates proposed, the 
actual indirect rates experienced and, if available, the final 
negotiated rate. Indicate the amount of unallowable costs included in 
the historical data.
    (iv) Offerors who propose indirect rates for new or substantially 
reorganized cost centers should consider offering to accept ceilings on 
the indirect rates at the proposed rates. Similarly, offerors whose 
subcontractors propose indirect rates for new or substantially 
reorganized cost centers should likewise consider offering to accept 
ceilings on the subcontractors' indirect rates at the proposed rates.

    Note to paragraph (b)(3)(iv). The Government reserves the right to 
adjust an offeror's or its subcontractor's estimated indirect costs for 
evaluation purposes based on the Agency's judgment of the most probable 
costs up to the amount of any stated ceiling.

    (v) If the employees are subject to the Service Contract Act or 
Davis Bacon Act, employees must receive the minimum level of benefits 
stated in the applicable Wage Determination.
    (4) Travel expense.
    (i) If the solicitation specifies the amount of travel costs, this 
amount is exclusive of any applicable indirect costs and fee.
    (ii) If the solicitation does not specify the amount of travel 
costs, attach a schedule illustrating how travel was computed. Include a 
breakdown indicating number of trips, number of travelers, destinations 
from and to, purpose and cost, e.g., mileage, transportation costs, 
subsistence rates.
    (5) Equipment, facilities and special equipment, including tooling.
    (i) If direct charges for use of existing contractor equipment are 
proposed, provide a description of these items, including estimated 
usage hours, rates, and total costs.
    (ii) If equipment purchases are proposed, provide a description of 
these items, and a justification as to why the Government should furnish 
the equipment or allow its purchase with contract funds. (Unless 
specified elsewhere in this solicitation, FAR 45.302-1 requires 
contractors to furnish all facilities in performance of contracts with 
certain limited exceptions.)
    (iii) Identify Government-owned property in the possession of the 
offeror or proposed to be used in the performance of the contract, and 
the Government agency which has cognizance over the property.
    (iv) Submit proposed rates or use charges for equipment, along with 
documentation to support those rates.
    (v) If special purposes facilities or equipment are being proposed, 
provide a description of these items, details for the proposed costs 
including competitive prices, and justification as to why the Government 
should furnish the equipment or allow its purchase with contract funds.
    (vi) If fabrication by the prime contractor is contemplated, include 
details of material, labor, and overhead.
    (6) Other Direct Costs (ODC).

[[Page 79]]

    (i) If the solicitation specifies the amount of other direct costs, 
this amount is exclusive of any applicable indirect cost and fee.
    (ii) If the amount is not specified in the solicitation, attach a 
schedule detailing how other direct costs were computed. Identify the 
major ODC items that under the accounting system would be a direct 
charge on any resulting contract.
    (iii) If any of the cost elements identified as part of the 
specified other direct costs are recovered as an indirect cost, in 
accordance with the offeror's accounting system, those costs should not 
be included as a direct cost. Complete explanation of this adjustment 
and the contractor's practice should be provided.
    (iv) Provide historical other direct costs dollars per level of 
effort hour on similar contracts or work assignments.
    (7) Team Subcontracts. When the cost of a subcontract is substantial 
(5 percent of the total estimated contract dollar value or $100,000, 
whichever is less), the offeror shall include the following 
subcontractor information:
    (i) Provide details of subcontract costs in the same format as the 
prime contractor's costs. This detailed information may be provided 
separately to the EPA if the subcontractor does not wish to provide this 
data to the prime contractor. Cost data provided separately by a 
contractor must be received by the time, date and at the location 
specified for the receipt of proposals. The subcontractor's package 
should be clearly marked with the RFP number, the name of the prime 
offeror, and a statement that the package is subcontractor data relevant 
to the proposal from the prime offeror. If submitted with the prime 
contractor's proposal, identify the subcontractors. State the amount of 
service estimated to be required and the quoted daily or hourly rate. 
Offerors are encouraged to provide letters of intent, signed by 
subcontractors, agreeing to a specified rate for life of the contract. 
Include a cost or price analysis of the subcontractor cost showing the 
reasons why the costs are considered reasonable;
    (ii) Describe how the prospective team subcontractors were chosen as 
part of the offeror's proposed team; and rationale for selection;
    (iii) Describe the necessity for the subcontractor's effort as 
either a supplement or complement to the offeror's in-house expertise;
    (iv) Identify the areas of the scope of work and the level of effort 
the subcontractors are anticipated to perform. Provide a reconciliation 
summary of the proposed hours and ODCs for the prime contractor and 
proposed subcontractor(s).
    (v) Describe the prime contractor's management structure and 
internal controls to ensure efficient and quality performance of team 
subcontractors.
    (8) Facilities Capital Cost of Money (FCCM). When an offeror elects 
to claim FCCM as an allowable cost, the offeror must submit Form CASB-
CNF and show calculation of the proposed amount. FCCM will be an 
allowable cost under the contemplated contract, if the criteria for 
allowability at FAR 31.205-10(a)(2) are met.

                           (End of provision)

    Alternate I (AUG 1999). If the Government's requirement is a fully 
dedicated staff person for a twelve month period(s) for each specified 
position and performance is on a Government facility, add the following 
paragraph (b)(2)(x) to the basic provision:

    (x) The level of effort for each position is to be proposed in work 
years. A work year is considered to consist of 2080 hours inclusive of 
direct and indirect time (40 hours per week x 52 weeks per year=2080 
hours). The proposal must identify proposed work years and clearly 
identify how many hours in each work year are direct (i.e., productive 
working hours) and how many are indirect (i.e., paid absences). If the 
company policy includes a different base work week, the total available 
hours would be different. For example, if the company's policy calls for 
a 37.5 hour work week, offeror would deduct paid absences from 1950 hour 
(37.5 hours/week x 52 weeks/year=1950 hours). Offeror should clearly 
identify the paid absences as to how many hours are for holiday and how 
many hours are for vacation and sick leave. The amount of indirect time 
(paid absences) identified in the proposal must be consistent with 
company policy and must allow for the ten Federal government holidays.

    Alternate II (AUG 1999). If the Government's requirement is a fully 
dedicated staff person for a twelve month period(s) for each specified 
position and performance is not on a Government facility; add the 
following paragraph (b)(2)(x) to the basic provision:

    (x) The level of effort for each position is to be proposed in work 
years. A work year is considered to consist of 2080 hours inclusive of 
direct and indirect time (40 hours per week x 52 weeks per year=2080 
hours). The proposal must identify proposed work years and clearly 
identify how many hours in each work year are direct (i.e., productive 
working hours) and how many are indirect (i.e., paid absences). If the 
company policy includes a different base work week, the total available 
hours would be different. For example, if the company's policy calls for 
a 37.5 hour work week, offeror would deduct paid absences from 1950 hour 
(37.5 hours/week x 52

[[Page 80]]

weeks/year=1950 hours). Offeror should clearly identify the paid 
absences as to how many hours are for holiday and how many hours are for 
vacation and sick leave.

    Alternate III (AUG 1999). If the requirement is for the acquisition 
of supplies or equipment, substitute the following paragraphs (a)(iv)--
(viii) and add (a)(ix) and (b).

    (iv) Provide information as to how the proposed supplies or 
equipment meet the salient characteristics required by the contract line 
item;
    (v) Provide published brochures, catalogs, or other technical 
literature by contract line item;
    (vi) Meet any interface or compatibility requirements by contract 
line item;
    (vii) Describe warranty services and how delivered by contract line 
item;
    (viii) Assumptions, deviations and exceptions (as necessary); and
    (ix) Additional information.
    (b) Supplies--Provide unit pricing by contract line items for:
    (i) each line item;
    (ii) delivery;
    (iii) installation;
    (iv) sets of operating manuals;
    (v) training;
    (vi) warranty;
    (vii) maintenance; and
    (viii) volume discounts.

Sec. 1552.215-74  Advanced understanding--uncompensated time.

    As prescribed in 1515.408(b), insert the following provision or one 
substantially the same as the following provision:

          Advanced Understanding--Uncompensated Time (AUG 1999)

    (a) The estimated cost of this contract is based upon the 
Contractor's proposal which specified that exempt personnel identified 
to work at the Contractor's facilities will provide uncompensated labor 
hours to the contract totaling -------- percent of compensated labor. 
(Note: the commitment for uncompensated time, and the formula elements 
in paragraph (b) below, apply only to exempt personnel working at the 
Contractor's facilities and does not include non-exempt personnel or 
exempt personnel working at other facilities.) Uncompensated labor hours 
are defined as hours of exempt personnel in excess of regular hours for 
a -------- pay period which are actually

[[Page 82]]

worked and recorded in accordance with the company policy, entitled, --
--------------.
    (b) Recognizing that the probable cost to the Government for the 
labor provided under this contract is calculated assuming a proposed 
level of uncompensated labor hours, it is hereby agreed that in the 
event the proposed level of uncompensated labor hours are not provided, 
an adjustment, calculated in accordance with the following formula will 
be made to the contract amount.
    Formula:
    Adjustment equals estimated value of uncompensated time hours not 
provided.
    Target uncompensated time percent minus ------ percent.
    Shortage of uncompensated time percent minus actual cost percent.
    Estimated value of uncompensated time hours not provided equals 
shortage of uncompensated time percent times total exempt applicable 
direct labor costs (including applicable indirect costs).
    (c) Within three weeks after the end of the contract, the Contractor 
shall submit a statement concerning the amount of uncompensated time 
hours delivered during the contract. In the event there is a shortage of 
uncompensated time hours provided, a calculation, utilizing the above 
formula will be made and this calculation will be the basis for an 
adjustment in the contract amount.
    (d) In the event adjustments are made to the contract, the adjusted 
amounts shall not be allowable as a direct or indirect cost to this or 
any other Government contract.

    As prescribed in 1515.209(c), insert the following clause:

                 Past Performance Information (OCT 2000)

    (a) Offerors shall submit the information requested below as part of 
their proposal for both the offeror and any proposed subcontractors for 
subcontracts expected to exceed $ * . The information may be submitted 
prior to other parts of the proposal in order to assist the Government 
in reducing the evaluation period.
    (b) Offerors shall submit a list of all or at least * contracts and 
subcontracts completed in the last * years, and all contracts and 
subcontracts currently in process, which are similar in nature to this 
requirement.
    (1) The contracts and subcontracts listed may include those entered 
into with Federal, State and local governments, and commercial 
businesses, which are of similar scope, magnitude, relevance, and 
complexity to the requirement which is described in the RFP. Include the 
following information for each contract and subcontract listed:
    (a) Name of contracting activity.
    (b) Contract number.
    (c) Contract title.

    (l) Compliance with subcontracting plan goals for small 
disadvantaged business concerns, monetary targets for small 
disadvantaged business participation, and the notifications submitted 
under FAR 19.1202-4 (b), if applicable.
    (c) Offerors should not provide general information on their 
performance on the identified contracts and subcontracts. General 
performance information will be obtained from the references.
    (1) Offerors may provide information on problems encountered and 
corrective actions taken on the identified contracts and subcontracts.
    (2) References that may be contacted by the Government include the 
contracting officer, program manager/project officer, or the 
administrative contracting officer identified above.
    (3) If no response is received from a reference, the Government will 
make an attempt to contact another reference identified by the offeror, 
to contact a reference not identified by the offeror, or to complete the 
evaluation with those references who responded. The Government shall 
consider the information provided by the references, and may also 
consider information obtained from other sources, when evaluating an 
offeror's past performance.
    (4) Attempts to obtain responses from references will generally not 
go beyond two telephonic messages and/or written requests from the 
Government, unless otherwise stated in the solicitation. The Government 
is not obligated to contact all of the references identified by the 
offeror.
    (d) If negative feedback is received from an offeror's reference, 
the Government will compare the negative response to the responses from 
the offeror's other references to note differences. A score will be 
assigned appropriately to the offeror based on the information. The 
offeror will be given the opportunity to address adverse past 
performance information obtained from references on

[[Page 83]]

which the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to comment, if that 
information makes a difference in the Government's decision to include 
the offeror in or exclude the offeror from the competitive range. Any 
past performance deficiency or significant weakness will be discussed 
with offerors in the competitive range during discussions.
    (e) Offerors must send Client Authorization Letters (see Section J 
of the solicitation) to each reference listed in their proposal to 
assist in the timely processing of the past performance evaluation. 
Offerors are encouraged to consolidate requests whenever possible (i.e., 
if the same reference has several contracts, send that reference a 
single notice citing all applicable contracts). Offerors may send Client 
Authorization Letters electronically to references with copies forwarded 
to the contracting officer.
    (1) If an offeror has no relevant past performance history, an 
offeror must affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant past 
performance history.
    (2) Client Authorization Letters should be mailed or E-mailed to 
individual references no later than five (5) working days after proposal 
submission. The offeror should forward a copy of the Client 
Authorization Letter to the contracting officer simultaneously with 
mailing to references.
    (f) Each offeror may describe any quality awards or certifications 
that indicate the offeror possesses a high-quality process for 
developing and producing the product or service required. Such awards or 
certifications include, for example, the Malcolm Baldrige Quality Award, 
other Government quality awards, and private sector awards or 
certifications.
    (1) Identify the segment of the company (one division or the entire 
company) which received the award or certification.
    (2) Describe when the award or certification was bestowed. If the 
award or certification is over three years old, present evidence that 
the qualifications still apply.
    (g) Past performance information will be used for both 
responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor for award. The 
Past Performance Questionnaire identified in section J will be used to 
collect information on an offeror's performance under existing and prior 
contracts/subcontracts for products or services similar in scope, 
magnitude, relevance, and complexity to this requirement in order to 
evaluate offerors consistent with the past performance evaluation factor 
set forth in section M. References other than those identified by the 
offeror may be contacted by the Government and used in the evaluation of 
the offeror's past performance.
    (h) Any information collected concerning an offeror's past 
performance will be maintained in the official contract file.
    (i) In accordance with FAR 15.305 (a) (2) (iv), offerors with no 
relevant past performance history, or for whom information on past 
performance is not available, will be evaluated neither favorably nor 
unfavorably on past performance.

Sec. 1552.219-71  Procedures for Participation in the EPA Mentor-Protege 
          Program.

    As prescribed in 1519.203(b), insert the following provision:

  Procedures for Participation in the EPA Mentor-Protege Program (OCT 
                                  2000)

    (a) This provision sets forth the procedures for participation in 
the EPA Mentor-Protege Program (hereafter referred to as the Program). 
The purpose of the Program is to increase the participation of concerns 
owned and/or controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged 
individuals as subcontractors, suppliers, and ultimately as prime 
contractors; to establish a mutually beneficial relationship between 
these concerns and EPA's large business prime contractors (although 
small businesses may participate as Mentors); to develop the technical 
and corporate administrative expertise of these concerns, which will 
ultimately lead to greater success in competition for contract 
opportunities; to promote the economic stability of these concerns; and 
to aid in the achievement of goals for the use of these concerns in 
subcontracting activities under EPA contracts. If the successful offeror 
is accepted into the Program they shall serve as a Mentor to a Protege 
firm(s), providing developmental assistance in accordance with an 
agreement with the Protege firm(s).
    (b) To participate as a Mentor, the offeror must receive approval in 
accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.
    (c) A Protege must be a concern owned and/or controlled by socially 
and economically disadvantaged individuals within the meaning of section 
8(a)(5) and (6) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 673(a)(5) and (6)), 
including historically black colleges and universities. Further, in 
accordance with Public Law 102-389 (the 1993 Appropriation Act), for 
EPA's contracting purposes, economically and socially disadvantaged 
individuals shall be deemed to include women.
    (d) Where there may be a concern regarding the Protege firm's 
eligibility to participate in the program, the protege's eligibility 
will be determined by the contracting officer after the SBA has 
completed any formal determinations.
    (e) The offeror shall submit an application in accordance with 
paragraph (k) of this section as part of its proposal which shall 
include as a minimum the following information.
    (1) A statement and supporting documentation that the offeror is 
currently performing under at least one active Federal contract with an 
approved subcontracting plan and is eligible for the award of Federal 
contracts;
    (2) A summary of the offeror's historical and recent activities and 
accomplishments under any disadvantaged subcontracting programs. The 
offeror is encouraged to include any initiatives or outreach information 
believed pertinent to approval as a Mentor firm;
    (3) The total dollar amount (including the value of all option 
periods or quantities) of EPA contracts and subcontracts received by the 
offeror during its two preceding fiscal years. (Show prime contracts and 
subcontracts separately per year);
    (4) The total dollar amount and percentage of subcontract awards 
made to all concerns owned and/or controlled by disadvantaged 
individuals under EPA contracts during its two preceding fiscal years. 
If recently required to submit a SF 295, provide copies of the two 
preceding year's reports;
    (5) The number and total dollar amount of subcontract awards made to 
the identified Protege firm(s) during the two preceding fiscal years (if 
any).
    (f) In addition to the information required by paragraph (e) of this 
section, the offeror shall submit as a part of the application the 
following information for each proposed Mentor-Protege relationship:
    (1) Information on the offeror's ability to provide developmental 
assistance to the identified Protege firm and how the assistance will 
potentially increase contracting and subcontracting opportunities for 
the Protege firm.

[[Page 90]]

    (2) A letter of intent indicating that both the Mentor firm and the 
Protege firm intend to enter into a contractual relationship under which 
the Protege will perform as a subcontractor under the contract resulting 
from this solicitation and that the firms will negotiate a Mentor-
Protege agreement. The letter of intent must be signed by both parties 
and contain the following information:
    (i) The name, address and phone number of both parties;
    (ii) The Protege firm's business classification, based upon the 
NAICS code(s) which represents the contemplated supplies or services to 
be provided by the Protege firm to the Mentor firm;
    (iii) A statement that the Protege firm meets the eligibility 
criteria;
    (iv) A preliminary assessment of the developmental needs of the 
Protege firm and the proposed developmental assistance the Mentor firm 
envisions providing the Protege. The offeror shall address those needs 
and how their assistance will enhance the Protege. The offeror shall 
develop a schedule to assess the needs of the Protege and establish 
criteria to evaluate the success in the Program;
    (v) A statement that if the offeror or Protege firm is suspended or 
debarred while performing under an approved Mentor-Protege agreement the 
offeror shall promptly give notice of the suspension or debarment to the 
EPA Office of Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) and the 
contracting officer. The statement shall require the Protege firm to 
notify the Contractor if it is suspended or debarred.
    (g) The application will be evaluated on the extent to which the 
offeror's proposal addresses the items listed in paragraphs (e) and (f) 
of this section. To the maximum extent possible, the application should 
be limited to not more than 10 single pages, double spaced. The offeror 
may identify more than one Protege in its application.
    (h) If the offeror is determined to be in the competitive range, or 
is awarded a contract without discussions, the offeror will be advised 
by the contracting officer whether their application is approved or 
rejected. The contracting officer, if necessary, may request additional 
information in connection with the offeror's submission of its revised 
or best and final offer. If the successful offeror has submitted an 
approved application, they shall comply with the clause titled ``Mentor-
Protege Program.''
    (i) Subcontracts of $1,000,000 or less awarded to firms approved as 
Proteges under the Program are exempt from the requirements for 
competition set forth in FAR 44.202-2(a)(5), and 52.244-5(b). However, 
price reasonableness must still be determined and the requirements in 
FAR 44.202-2(a)(8) for cost and price analysis continue to apply.
    (j) Costs incurred by the offeror in fulfilling their agreement(s) 
with a Protege firm(s) are not reimbursable as a direct cost under the 
contract. Unless EPA is the responsible audit agency under FAR 42.703-1, 
offerors are encouraged to enter into an advance agreement with their 
responsible audit agency on the treatment of such costs when determining 
indirect cost rates. Where EPA is the responsible audit agency, these 
costs will be considered in determining indirect cost rates.
    (k) Submission of Application and Questions Concerning the Program.
    The application for the Program for Headquarters and Regional 
procurements shall be submitted to the contracting officer, and to the 
EPA OSDBU at the following address: Socioeconomic Business Program

this contract.
    (2) If the Contracting Officer allows submissions more frequently 
than monthly, one submittal each month shall have the same ending period 
of performance as the monthly progress report.
    (3) Where cumulative amounts on the monthly progress report differ 
from the aggregate amounts claimed in the invoice(s) or request(s) for 
contract financing payments covering the same period, the contractor 
shall provide a reconciliation of the difference as part of the payment

<R05>
Sec. 1552.232-73  Payments--fixed-rate services contract.

    As prescribed in 1532.111, insert the following in indefinite 
delivery/indefinite quantity contracts with fixed services rates.

            Payments--Fixed-Rate Services Contract (OCT 2000)

    The Government shall pay the Contractor as follows upon the 
submission of invoices or vouchers approved by the Contracting Officer:
    (a) Hourly rate. (1) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying 
the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the Schedule by the number of 
direct labor hours performed. The rates shall include wages, indirect 
costs, general and administrative expenses, and profit. Fractional parts 
of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis. Vouchers may be 
submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by 
the Contracting Officer) to the paying office. The Contractor shall 
substantiate vouchers by evidence of actual payment and by individual 
daily job, timecards, or other substantiation approved by the 
Contracting Officer. Promptly after receipt of each substantiated 
voucher, the Government shall, except as otherwise provided in this 
contract and subject to the terms of paragraph (e) of this contract, pay 
the voucher as approved by the Contracting Officer.
    (2) Unless otherwise prescribed in the Schedule, the Contracting 
Officer shall withhold 5 percent of the amounts due under this paragraph 
(a), but the total amount withheld shall not exceed $50,000. The amounts 
withheld shall be retained until the execution and delivery of a release 
by the Contractor as provided in paragraph (f) of this contract.
    (3) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in 
the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having 
performed work on an overtime basis. If no overtime rates are provided 
in the Schedule and overtime work is approved in advance by the 
Contracting Officer, overtime rates shall be negotiated. Failure to 
agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the 
``Disputes'' clause of this contract. If the Schedule provides rates for 
overtime the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to 
the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer.
    (b) Materials, other direct costs, and subcontracts. (1) The 
allowability of direct materials and other direct costs shall be 
determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with subpart 31.2 of 
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in effect on the date of this 
contract. Reasonable and allocable material handling costs or indirect 
costs may be included in the charge for material or other direct costs 
to the extent they are clearly excluded from the hourly rate. Material 
handling and/or indirect cost rates are specified in the ``Indirect 
Costs'' clause. Material handling costs are comprised of indirect costs, 
including, when appropriate, general and administrative expense 
allocated to direct materials in accordance with the Contractor's usual 
accounting practices consistent with subpart 31.2 of the FAR. The 
Contractor shall be reimbursed for items and services purchased directly 
for the contract only when cash, checks, or other forms of actual 
payment have been made for such purchased items or services. Direct 
materials or other direct costs, as used in this clause, are those items 
which enter directly into the end product, or which are used or consumed 
directly in connection with the furnishing of the end product.
    (2) Subcontracted effort may be included in the fixed hourly rates 
discussed in paragraph (a)(l) of this clause and will be reimbursed as 
discussed in that paragraph. Otherwise, the cost of subcontracts that 
are authorized under the subcontracts clause of this contract shall be 
reimbursable costs under this clause provided that the costs are 
consistent with paragraph (b)(3) of this clause. Reimbursable costs in 
connection with subcontracts shall be payable to subcontractors 
consistent with FAR 32.504 in the same manner as for services purchased 
directly for the contract under paragraph (a)(1) of this clause. 
Reimbursable costs shall not include any costs arising from the letting, 
administration, or supervision of performance of the subcontract, if the 
costs are included in the hourly rates payable under paragraph (a)(l) of 
this clause.
    (3) To the extent able, the Contractor shall (i) obtain materials at 
the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing 
prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and (ii) take all cash and 
trade discounts, rebates, allowances, credits, salvage, commissions, and 
other benefits. When unable to take advantage of the benefits, the 
Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer and give the 
reasons. Credit shall be given to the Government for cash and trade 
discounts, rebates, allowances, credits, salvage, the value of any 
appreciable

[[Page 96]]

scrap, commissions, and other amounts that have accrued to the benefit 
of the Contractor, or would have accrued except for the fault or neglect 
of the Contractor. The benefits lost without fault or neglect on the 
part of the Contractor, or lost through fault of the Government, shall 
not be deducted from gross costs.
    (4) If the nature of the work to be performed requires the 
Contractor to furnish material which is regularly sold to the general 
public in the normal course of business by the Contractor, the price to 
be paid for such material, notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this 
contract, shall be on the basis of an established catalog or list price, 
in effect when the material is furnished, less all applicable discounts 
to the Government; provided, that in no event shall such price be in 
excess of the Contractor's sales price to its most favored customer for 
the same item in like quantity, or the current market price, whichever 
is lower.
    (c) Contracting Officer notification. For contract administration 
purposes, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing 
when the total value of all delivery orders issued exceeds 85 percent of 
the maximum price specified in the schedule.
    (d) Maximum amount. The Government shall not be obligated to pay the 
Contractor any amount in excess of the maximum amount in the Schedule, 
and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to 
do so would exceed the maximum amount set forth in the Schedule, unless 
or until the Contracting Officer shall have notified the Contractor in 
writing that the maximum amount has been increased and shall have 
specified in the notice a revised maximum that shall constitute the 
maximum amount for performance under this contract. When and to the 
extent that the maximum amount set forth in the Schedule has been 
increased, any hours expended, and material or other direct costs 
incurred by the Contractor in excess of the maximum amount before the 
increase, shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended 
and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the maximum 
amount.
    (e) Audit. At any time before final payment under this contract, the 
Contracting Officer may request audit of the invoices or vouchers and 
substantiating material. Each payment previously made shall be subject 
to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices or 
vouchers, that are found by the Contracting Officer not to have been 
properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments 
or to increase for underpayments. Upon receipt and approval of the 
voucher or invoice designated by the Contractor as the ``completion 
voucher'' or ``completion invoice'' and substantiating material, and 
upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract 
(including, without limitation, terms relating to patents and the terms 
of paragraphs (f) and (g) of this clause), the Government shall promptly 
pay any balance due the Contractor. The completion invoice or voucher, 
and substantiating material, shall be submitted by the Contractor as 
promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this 
contract, but in no event, later than one year (or such longer period as 
the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of 
completion.
    (f) Assignment. The Contractor, and each assignee under an 
assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of 
final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the 
time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this 
contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, 
and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims 
arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following 
exceptions:
    (1) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if 
the amounts are not susceptible of exact statement by the Contractor.
    (2) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon 
the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of 
performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the 
date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives 
notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after 
the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that 
the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier.
    (3) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the 
Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against 
patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by 
the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents.
    (g) Refunds. The Contractor agrees that any refunds, rebates, or 
credits (including any related interest) accruing to or received by the 
Contractor or any assignee, that arise under the materials portion of 
this contract and for which the Contractor has received reimbursement, 
shall be paid by the Contractor to the Government. The Contractor and 
each assignee, under an assignment entered into under this contract and 
in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall 
execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to 
final payment under this contract, an assignment to the Government of 
such refunds, rebates, or credits (including any interest) in form and 
substance satisfactory to the Contracting Officer.

    (i) Before asking for the information, the Contractor shall identify 
itself, explain that it is performing contractual work for the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, identify the information that it is 
seeking to collect, explain what will be done with the information, and 
give the following notice:

the subcontractor to collect information. The Contractor agrees to

    (c) The Contractor understands that CBI obtained by EPA under FIFRA

  Data Security for Toxic Substances Control Act Confidential Business 
                         Information (DEC 1997)

    The Contractor shall handle Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) 
confidential business information (CBI) in accordance with the contract 
clause entitled ``Treatment of Confidential Business Information'' and 
``Screening Business Information for Claims of Confidentiality.''
    (a) The Project Officer (PO) or his/her designee, after a written 
determination by the appropriate program office, may disclose TSCA CBI 
to the contractor necessary to carry out the work required under this 
contract. The Contractor shall protect all TSCA CBI to which it has 
access (including CBI used in its computer operations) in accordance 
with the following requirements:
    (1) The Contractor and Contractor's employees shall follow the 
security procedures set forth in the TSCA CBI Security Manual. The 
manual may be obtained from the Director, Information Management 
Division (IMD), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT), U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., 
Washington, DC 20460. Prior to receipt of TSCA CBI by the Contractor, 
the Contractor shall ensure that all employees who will be cleared for 
access to TSCA CBI have been briefed on the handling, control, and 
security requirements set forth in the TSCA CBI Security Manual.
    (2) The Contractor shall permit access to and inspection of the 
Contractor's facilities in use under this contract by representatives of 
EPA's Assistant Administrator for Administration and Resources 
Management, and the TSCA Security Staff in the OPPT, or by the EPA 
Project Officer.
    (3) The Contractor Document Control Officer (DCO) shall obtain a 
signed copy of EPA Form 7740-6, ``TSCA CBI Access Request, Agreement, 
and Approval,'' from each of the Contractor's employees who will have 
access to the information before the employee is allowed access. In 
addition, the Contractor shall obtain from each employee who will be 
cleared for TSCA CBI access all information required by EPA or the U.S. 
Office of Personnel Management for EPA to conduct a Minimum Background 
Investigation.
    (b) The Contractor agrees that these requirements concerning 
protection of TSCA CBI are included for the benefit of, and shall be 
enforceable by, both EPA and any affected business having a proprietary 
interest in the information.
    (c) The Contractor understands that CBI obtained by EPA under TSCA 
may not be disclosed except as authorized by the Act, and that any 
unauthorized disclosure by the Contractor or the Contractor's employees 
may subject the Contractor and the Contractor's employees to the 
criminal penalties specified in TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2613(d)). For purposes 
of this contract, the only disclosures that EPA authorizes the 
Contractor to make are those set forth in the clause entitled 
``Treatment of Confidential Business Information.''
    (d) The Contractor agrees to include the provisions of this clause, 
including this paragraph (d), in all subcontracts awarded pursuant to 
this contract that require the furnishing of CBI to the subcontractor.
    (e) At the request of EPA or at the end of the contract, the 
Contractor shall return to the EPA PO or his/her designee, all 
documents, logs, and magnetic media which contain TSCA CBI. In addition, 
each Contractor employee who has received TSCA CBI clearance will sign 
EPA Form 7740-18, ``Confidentiality Agreement for Contractor Employees 
Upon Relinquishing TSCA CBI Access Authority.'' The Contractor DCO will 
also forward those agreements to the EPA OPPT/IMD, with a copy to the 
CO, at the end of the contract.
    (f) If, subsequent to the date of this contract, the Government 
changes the security requirements, the CO shall equitably adjust 
affected provisions of this contract, in accordance with the ``Changes'' 
clause, when:
    (1) The Contractor submits a timely written request for an equitable 
adjustment; and,
    (2) The facts warrant an equitable adjustment.

individuals not employed by EPA. Business information that is ordinarily 
entitled to confidential treatment under existing Agency regulations (40

Information.'') Except where otherwise provided by law, the Agency will 
permit the release of CBI under subparagraphs (1), (3), (4), (5), (6), 
or (9) only pursuant to a confidentiality agreement.
    (d) With respect to contractors, 1552.235-71 will be used as the 
confidentiality agreement. With respect to Potentially Responsible 
Parties, such confidentiality agreements may permit further disclosure 
to other entities where necessary to further settlement or litigation of 
claims under CERCLA. Such entities include, but are not limited to 
accounting firms and technical experts able to analyze the information, 
provided that they also agree to be bound by an appropriate 
confidentiality agreement.
    (e) This clause does not authorize the Agency to release the 
Contractor's CBI to the public pursuant to a request filed under the 
Freedom of Information Act.
    (f) The Contractor agrees to include this clause, including this 
paragraph (f), in all subcontracts at all levels awarded pursuant to

Government are non-personal services and the parties recognize and agree 
that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the

direction, or evaluation of a Government employee.

procurement activities.
    (c) Employee relationship. (1) The services to be performed under

by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under its responsibility for 
good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel 
who enter the Government installation or who travel on Government 
transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish 
any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-
personal services contract.
    (d) Inapplicability of employee benefits. This contract does not 
create an employer-employee relationship. Accordingly, entitlements and 
benefits applicable to such relationships do not apply.

to Federal income tax withholdings.
    (2) Payments by the Government under this contract are not subject

responsibility to monitor contract activities and notify the Contracting 
Officer if the Contractor believes that the intent of this clause has 
been or may be violated.
    (1) The Contractor should notify the Contracting Officer in writing 
promptly, within -------- (to be negotiated and inserted into the basic 
contract at contract award) calendar days from the date of any incident 
that the Contractor considers to constitute a violation of this clause. 
The notice should include the date, nature and circumstance of the 
conduct, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or 
Contractor official or employee involved or knowledgeable about such 
conduct, identify any documents or substance of any oral communication 
involved in the conduct, and the estimate in time by which the 
Government must respond to this notice to minimize cost, delay or 
disruption of performance.
    (2) The Contracting Officer will promptly, within -------- (to be 
negotiated and inserted into the basic contract at contract award) 
calendar days after receipt of notice, respond to the notice in writing. 
In responding, the Contracting Officer will either:
    (i) Confirm that the conduct is in violation and when necessary 
direct the mode of further performance,
    (ii) Countermand any communication regarded as a violation,
    (iii) Deny that the conduct constitutes a violation and when 
necessary direct the mode of further performance; or
    (iv) In the event the notice is inadequate to make a decision,

contract shall be established between the Contractor and the appropriate 
Government representative (EPA, other Government agency, or auditor), as

Advisory and Financial Analysis Division, Washington, DC 20460.

Where EPA is not the cognizant agency, the final rate proposal shall be 
submitted to the above-cited address, to the cognizant audit agency, and 
to the designated Contracting Officer of the cognizant agency. Upon 
establishment of the final indirect cost rates, the Contractor shall

property to the contractor for use in the performance of this contract. 
This property shall be used and maintained by the contractor in 
accordance with the provisions of the ``Government Property'' clause.
    (d) The ``EPA Contract Property Administration Requirements'' 
provided below apply to this contract.

                  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency

               Property Administration Requirements (PAR)

    1. Purpose. This document sets forth the requirements for 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) contractors in the performance of 
their Government property management responsibilities under contracts 
with EPA. These requirements supplement those contained in the 
Government property clause(s) in this contract, and part 45 of the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).
    2. Delegation of Contract Property Administration. EPA has delegated 
much of its contract property management oversight to the Defense 
Contract Management Command (DCMC). Shortly after award of a contract, 
the EPA contracting officer (CO) delegates the functions of property 
administration and plant clearance (disposal) for the contract to DCMC. 
Upon acceptance of that delegation, DCMC will provide notification to 
the contractor, identifying the assigned property administrator (PA) and 
plant clearance officer (PLCO). If the contract is not delegated to DCMC 
for administration, any reference to PA and PLCO throughout this 
document shall be construed to mean CO. The DCMC PA is available to the 
contractor for assistance in all matters of property administration. 
Notwithstanding the delegation, as necessary, the contractor may contact 
their EPA CO. In the event of disagreement between the contractor and 
the DCMC PA, the contractor should seek resolution from the CO. Unless 
otherwise directed in the contract, or this document, all originals of 
written information or reports, except direct correspondence between the 
contractor and the DCMC PA, relative to Government property, should be 
forwarded to the administrative CO assigned to this contract.
    3. Requests for Government Property.
    a. In accordance with FAR 45.102, the contractor shall furnish all 
property required for performing Government contracts. If a contractor 
believes that Government facilities are required for performance of the 
contract, the contractor shall submit a written request to the CO. At a 
minimum, the request shall contain the following elements:
    1. Contract number for which the facilities are required.
    2. An item(s) description, quantity and estimated cost.
    3. Certification that no like contractor facilities exist which 
could be utilized.
    4. A detailed description of the task-related purpose of the 
facilities.
    5. Explanation of negative impact if facilities are not provided by 
the Government.
    6. If applicable, recommend the exception under FAR 45.302-1(a) or 
any applicable EPA class deviation (available upon request), and provide 
any other information which would

[[Page 109]]

support the furnishing of facilities, including contractor-acquired 
property (CAP).
    7. Except when the request is for material, a lease versus purchase 
analysis shall be furnished with the request to acquire property on 
behalf of the Government. The contractor may not proceed with 
acquisition of facilities on behalf of the Government until receipt of 
written authorization from the EPA CO.
    4. Transfer of Government Property. When the contractor receives 
Government-furnished property (GFP), the contractor should receive, from 
the transferor, (either EPA or another contractor) all of the applicable 
data elements (Attachment 1 of this clause) needed to maintain the 
required records. If this information is not provided at the time of 
receipt of the property, the contractor shall request it from the EPA 
CO. The CO will attempt to obtain the data from the previous property 
holder, or, if data does not exist, will assist the current property 
holder in estimating the elements. Prior to signing an acceptance 
document for the property, the receiving contractor should perform a 
complete inventory of the property. Responsibility, as well as 
accountability, passes with the signed acceptance. When, at the written 
direction of the EPA CO, the contractor transfers GFP to another 
contractor, or another Agency, the contractor shall provide the 
applicable data elements (Attachment 1 of this clause). Upon return of 
the property to EPA, the same data must be provided by the contractor to 
the EPA CO.
    5. Records of Government Property.
    a. In accordance with FAR 45.505 and 45.505-1, the contractor shall 
establish and maintain adequate property records for all Government 
property, regardless of value, including property provided to and in the 
possession of a subcontractor. Material (supplies) provided by the 
Government or acquired by the contractor and billed as a direct charge 
to the Government is Government property and records must be established 
as such.
    b. The contractor shall establish and maintain the official 
Government property record. (If the contract contains the FAR Clause 
52.245-1, the Government will maintain the official Government property 
records.) Such records shall contain the applicable data elements 
(Attachment 1 of this clause) for all items of Government property 
regardless of cost.
    c. The Contractor shall identify all Superfund property and 
designate it as such both on the item and on the official Government 
property record. If it is not practicable to tag the item, the 
contractor shall write the ID number on a tag, card or other entity that 
may be kept with the item or in a file.
    d. Support documentation used for posting entries to the property 
record shall provide complete, current and auditable data. Entries shall 
be posted to the record in a timely manner following an action.
    e. For Government vehicles, in addition to the data elements 
required by EPA, the contractor shall also comply with the General 
Services Administration (GSA) and Department of Energy (DOE) record and 
report requirements supplied with all EPA provided motor vehicles. If 
the above requirements were not provided with the vehicle, the 
contractor shall notify the EPA CO.
    f. When Government property is disclosed to be in the possession or 
control of the contractor but not provided under any contract, the 
contractor shall record and report the property in accordance with FAR 
45.502(f) and (h).
    6. Inventories of Government Property. The contractor shall conduct 
a complete physical inventory of EPA property at least once per year, 
unless otherwise directed by the PA. Reconciliation shall be completed 
within 30 calendar days of inventory completion. The contractor shall 
report the results of the inventory, including any discrepancies, to the 
DCMC PA upon completion of the reconciliation. The contractor's records 
shall indicate the completion date of the inventory. See section 9 
herein, Contract Closeout, for information on final inventories.
    7. Reports of Government Property. In accordance with FAR 45.505-14, 
EPA requires an annual summary report, for each contract, by contract 
number, of Government property in the contractor's possession as of 
September 30 each year.
    a. For each classification listed in FAR 45.505-14(a), except 
material, the contractor shall provide the total acquisition cost and 
total quantity. If there are zero items in a classification, or if there 
is an ending balance of zero, the classification must be listed with 
zeros in the quantity and acquisition cost columns.
    b. For material, the contractor shall provide the total acquisition 
cost only.
    c. Property classified as facilities, special tooling, special test 
equipment, and agency peculiar must be reported on two separate lines. 
The first line shall include the total acquisition cost and quantity of 
all items or systems with a unit acquisition cost of $25,000 or more. 
The second line shall include the total acquisition cost and quantity of 
all items with a unit acquisition cost of less than $25,000.
    d. For items comprising a system, which is defined as ``a group of 
interacting items functioning as a complex whole,'' the contractor may 
maintain the record as a system noting all components of the system 
under the main component or maintain individual records for each item. 
However, for the annual report of Government property the components 
must be reported as a system with one total dollar amount for the 
system, if that system total is $25,000 or more.

[[Page 110]]

    e. The reports are to be received at EPA and DCMC no later than 
October 31 of each year.
    f. Distribution shall be as follows:

Original to: EPA CO
1 copy: DCMC PA

    g. EPA Contractors are required to comply with GSA's and DOE's 
special reporting requirements for motor vehicles. A statement of these 
requirements will be provided by the EPA Facility Management and 
Services Division (FMSD) concurrent with receipt of each vehicle.
    h. The contractor shall provide detailed reports on an as-needed 
basis, as may be requested by the CO or the PA.
    8. Disposition of Government Property. The disposition process is 
composed of three distinct phases: identification of excess property, 
reporting of excess property, and final disposition.
    a. Identification of Excess Property. The disposition process begins 
with the contractor identifying Government property that is excess to 
its contract. Effective contractor property control systems provide for 
disclosing excesses as they occur. Once inactive Government property has 
been determined to be excess to the contract to which it is accountable, 
it must be screened against the contractor's other EPA contracts for 
further use. If the property may be reutilized, the contractor shall 
notify the CO in writing. Government property will be transferred to 
other contracts only when the COs on both the current contract and the 
receiving contract authorize such a transfer in writing.
    b. Reporting Excess Government Property. Excess Government property 
shall be reported in accordance with FAR Subpart 45.6. Inventory 
schedules A-E (SF Forms 1426-1434) provide the format for reporting of 
excess Government property. Instructions for completing the forms are 
located at FAR 45.606-5 and samples may be found in FAR 53.301-1426 thru 
1434. Inventory schedules shall be forwarded to the DCMC PLCO with a 
copy to the EPA CO. The cover letter, which accompanies the inventory 
schedules, must include the EPA CO's name, address and telephone number. 
Inventory schedules must also contain a notification if the property is 
Superfund property. If the property is Superfund property, the 
contractor must also prominently include the following language on the 
inventory schedule: ``Note to PLCO: Reimbursement to the EPA Superfund 
is required.'' When requested, by the PLCO or the CO, the contractor 
will provide the fair market value for those items requested.
    c. Disposition Instructions.
    1. If directed in writing by the EPA CO, the contractor will retain 
all or part of the excess Government property under the current contract 
for possible future requirements. The contractor shall request, from the 
PLCO, withdrawal from the inventory schedule of those items to be 
retained.
    2. If directed in writing by the EPA CO, the contractor shall 
transfer the property to another EPA contractor. The contractor will 
transfer the property by shipping it in accordance with the instructions 
provided by the CO. The contractor shall request, from the PLCO, 
withdrawal from the inventory schedule of those items to be transferred. 
Further, the contractor shall notify the CO when the transfer is 
complete.
    3. If directed in writing by the EPA CO, the contractor shall 
transfer the property to EPA. The contractor shall ship/deliver the 
property in accordance with the instructions provided by the CO. The 
contractor will request, from the PLCO, withdrawal from the inventory 
schedule of those items to be transferred to EPA. Further, the 
contractor shall notify the CO when the transfer is complete.
    4. The contractor will ship the property elsewhere if directed, in 
writing, by the PLCO.
    5. The PLCO will either conduct the sale or instruct the contractor 
to conduct a sale of surplus property. The contractor will allow 
prospective bidders access to property offered for sale.
    6. Property abandoned by the PLCO on the contractor's site must be 
disposed of in a manner that does not endanger the health and safety of 
the public.
    7. To effect transfer of accountability, the contractor shall 
provide the recipient of the property with the applicable data elements 
set forth in Attachment 1 of this clause. The contractor shall also 
obtain either a signed receipt from the recipient, or proof of shipment. 
The contractor shall update the official Government property record to 
indicate the disposition of the item and to close the record.
    9. Contract Closeout. The contractor shall complete a physical 
inventory of all Government property at contract completion and the 
results, including any discrepancies, shall be reported to the DCMC PA. 
In the case of a terminated contract, the contractor shall comply with 
the inventory requirements set forth in the applicable termination 
clause. The results of the inventory, as well as a detailed inventory 
listing, must be forwarded to the CO. For terminated contracts, the 
contractor will conduct and report the inventory results as directed by 
the CO. However, in order to expedite the disposal process, contractors 
may be required to, or may elect to submit to the CO, an inventory 
schedule for disposal purposes up to six (6) months prior to contract 
completion. If such an inventory schedule is prepared, the contractor 
must indicate the earliest date that each item may be disposed. The 
contractor shall update all property records to show disposal action. 
The contractor shall

[[Page 111]]

notify the DCMC PA, in writing, when all work has been completed under 
the contract and all Government property accountable to the contract has 
been disposed.

                              Attachment 1

    Required Data Elements. Where applicable (all elements are not 
applicable to material) the contractor is required to maintain, at a 
minimum, the information related to the following data elements for EPA 
Government property: Contractor Identification/Tag Number; Description; 
Manufacturer; Model; Serial Number; Acquisition Date; Date received; 
Acquisition Cost*; Acquisition Document Number; Location; Contract 
Number; Account Number (if supplied); Superfund (Yes/No); Inventory 
Performance Date; Disposition Date.
    * Acquisition cost shall include the price of the item plus all 
taxes, transportation and installation charges allocable to that item.

    Note: For items comprising a system which is defined as, ``a group 
of interacting items functioning as a complex whole,'' the contractor 
may maintain the record as a system noting all components of the system 
under the main component or maintain individual records for each item. 
However, for the Annual Report of Government Property, the components 
must be reported as a system with one total dollar amount for the 
system, if that system total is $25,000 or more.

    Appendix I to Chapter 15--Environmental Protection Agency; Class 
 Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition in Acquisitions 
  From the Federal Prison Industries and the Government Printing Office

    1. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) anticipates the 
acquisition of supplies from the Federal Prison Industries (UNICOR) and 
the acquisition of Government printing and related supplies from the 
Government Printing Office (GPO) to meet the needs of the Agency.
    2. The Agency is authorized to make these acquisitions from the 
UNICOR and GPO without full and open competition under the authority in 
41 U.S.C. 253(c)(5) as sources required by statute, i.e., 18 U.S.C. 4124 
and 44 U.S.C. 501-504, 1121.
    3. The anticipated cost of these acquisitions to the Agency will be 
fair and reasonable.
    4. This class justification applies to any proposed acquisition made 
by the EPA from the UNICOR or GPO.
    5. This class justification will remain in effect until April 1, 
1988.
    6. The undersigned certifies that this class justification is 
accurate and complete to the best of his knowledge and belief.

               Subpart 1601.1_Purpose, Authority, Issuance


<R05>
Sec. 1601.101  Purpose.

    (a) This subpart establishes chapter 16, Office of Personnel 
Management Federal Employees Health Benefits Acquisition Regulation, 
within title 48, the Federal Acquisition Regulation System, of the Code 
of Federal Regulations. The short title of this regulation shall be 
FEHBAR.
    (b) The purpose of the FEHBAR is to implement and supplement the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) specifically for acquiring and 
administering contracts with health insurance carriers in the Federal 
Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP).


<R05>
Sec. 1601.102  Authority.

    (a) The FEHBAR is issued by the Director of the Office of Personnel 
Management in accordance with the authority of 5 U.S.C. chapter 89 and 
other applicable law and regulation.
    (b) The FEHBAR does not replace or incorporate regulations found at 
5 CFR part 890, which provides the substantive policy guidance for 
administration of the FEHBP under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 89. The following is 
the order of precedence in interpreting a contract provision under the 
FEHBP:
    (1) 5 U.S.C. Chapter 89;
    (2) 5 CFR part 890;
    (3) 48 CFR Chapters 1 and 16;
    (4) The FEHBP contract.

[52 FR 16037, May 1, 1987, as amended at 59 FR 14764, Mar. 30, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 1601.103  Applicability.

    The FAR is generally applicable to contracts negotiated in the FEHBP 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. chapter 89. The FEHBAR implements and supplements 
the FAR where necessary to identify basic and significant acquisition 
policies unique to the FEHBP.


<R05>
Sec. 1601.104  Issuance.


<R05>
Sec. 1601.104-1  Publication and code arrangement.

    (a) The FEHBAR and its subsequent changes are published in
    (1) Daily issues of the Federal Register; and
    (2) Cumulative form of the Code of Federal Regulations.
    (b) The FEHBAR is issued as chapter 16 of title 48 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 1601.104-2  Arrangement of regulation.

    (a) General. The FEHBAR conforms with the arrangement and numbering 
system prescribed by FAR 1.104. However, when a FAR part or subpart is 
adequate for use without further OPM implementation or supplementation, 
there will be no corresponding FEHBAR part, subpart, etc. The FEHBAR is 
to be used in conjunction with the FAR and the order for use is:
    (1) FAR;
    (2) FEHBAR.
    (b) Citation. (1) In formal documents, such as legal briefs, 
citation of chapter 16 material that has been published in the Federal 
Register will be to title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
    (2) In informal documents, any section of chapter 16 may be 
identified as ``FEHBAR'' followed by the section number.

          Subpart 1601.3_Agency Acquisition Regulation (FEHBAR)


<R05>
Sec. 1601.301  Policy.

    (a) Procedures, contract clauses, and other aspects of the 
acquisition process for contracts in the FEHBP shall be consistent with 
the principles of the FAR. Changes to the FAR that are otherwise 
authorized by statute or applicable regulation, dictated by the 
practical realities associated with the unique nature of health care 
procurements, or necessary to satisfy specific needs of the Office of 
Personnel Management shall be implemented as amendments to the FEHBAR 
and published in the Federal Register, or as deviations to the FAR in 
accordance with FAR subpart 1.4.
    (b) Internal procedures, instructions, and guides that are necessary 
to clarify or implement the FEHBAR within OPM may be issued by agency 
officials specifically designated by the Director, OPM. Normally, such 
designations will be specified in the OPM Administrative Manual, which 
is routinely available to agency employees and will be made available to 
interested outside parties upon request. Clarifying or implementing 
procedures, instructions, and guides issued pursuant to this section of 
the FEHBAR must--
    (1) Be consistent with the policies and procedures contained in this 
regulation as implemented and supplemented from time to time; and
    (2) Follow the format, arrangement, and numbering system of this 
regulation to the extent practicable.

rating; and,
    (3) Meet the criteria specified in the rate instructions issued by 
OPM.
    (b) Any group with which an FEHB carrier enters into an agreement to 
provide health care services is a potential SSSG (including separate 
lines of business, government entities, groups that have multi-year 
contracts, and groups having point-of-service products).
    (c) Exceptions to the general rule stated in paragraph (b) of this 
section are (and the following groups must be excluded from SSSG 
consideration):
    (1) Groups the carrier rates by the method of retrospective 
experience rating;

two rates derived by using rating methods consistent with those used to 
derive the SSSG rates.

    (a) Large Provider Agreement means an agreement between--
    (1) An FEHB carrier, at least 25 percent of which total contracts 
are FEHB enrollee contracts, and
    (2) A vendor of services or supplies such as mail order pharmacy 
services, pharmacy benefit management services, mental health and/or 
substance abuse management services, preferred provider organization 
services, utilization review services, and/or large case or disease 
management services. This representative list includes organizations 
that own or contract with direct providers of healthcare or supplies, or 
organizations that process claims or manage patient care. A hospital is 
not

[[Page 119]]

considered to be a vendor for purposes of this chapter.

term for FEHB members, including benefits and services, are reasonably 
expected to exceed 5 percent of the carrier's total FEHB benefits costs, 
or
    (ii) Where the total administrative costs charged to the FEHB 
carrier for the contract term for FEHB members are reasonably expected 
to exceed 5 percent of the carrier's total FEHB administrative costs 
(applicable to agreements where the provider is not responsible for FEHB 
benefits costs).
    (3) As used in this section, the term ``carrier'' does not include 
local health plans that serve under an umbrella arrangement with an FEHB 
carrier.
    (b) The FEHB Program Annual Accounting Statement for the FEHB Plan 
for the prior contract year will be used to determine the 5 percent 
threshold under Large Provider Agreements.
    (c) Large Provider Agreements based on cost analysis are subject to 
the provisions of FAR 52.215-2, ``Audit and Records-Negotiation.''
    (d) Large Provider Agreements based on price analysis are subject to 
the provisions of 48 CFR 1646.301 and 1652.246-70.

      Subpart 1603.70_Misleading, Deceptive, or Unfair Advertising


<R05>
Sec. 1603.7001  Policy.

    (a) OPM prepares and distributes or makes available to Federal 
employees and annuitants a comparison booklet which presents summary 
information and a benefits brochure which details benefits, limitations, 
and premium rates for all participating plans. OPM does not encourage, 
support, or reimburse participating carriers for the costs of 
advertisements. However, while OPM believes that advertising is 
unnecessary, it recognizes that the decision to use advertising rests 
with each carrier.
    (b) OPM discourages advertising that is misleading or deceptive. 
This includes advertising that is directed at other carriers' plans 
participating in the Program and which uses incomplete or inappropriate 
comparisons or disparaging or minimizing techniques. Such unfair 
practices are prejudicial to the interests of the vast majority of 
carriers whose advertising is fair and accurate.
    (c) Failure to conform to the requirements of this subpart shall be 
a material breach of the contract and may result in withdrawal of 
approval to continue participation in the FEHB Program.

[52 FR 16039, May 1, 1987. Redesignated at 62 FR 47574, Sept. 10, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 1603.7002  Additional guidelines.

    Any advertisements which identify a carrier's participation in the 
FEHBP shall--
    (a) Be limited to the merits of the carrier's FEHBP plan and shall 
be limited to factual statements of the benefits and rates offered by 
that plan. The official document for benefit and rate comparisons among 
FEHBP plans is the comparison chart issued by OPM.
    (b) Not use the FEHBP logo.
    (c) Recognize that the officially approved plan brochure is the sole 
contractual statement of benefits, limitations, and exclusions. All 
advertisements that in any way discuss plan benefits shall contain the 
following statement:

    This is a summary (or brief description) of the features of the 
(plan's name). Before making a final decision, please read the plan's 
officially approved brochure, (brochure number). All benefits are 
subject to the definitions, limitations, and exclusions set forth in the 
official brochure.
    (d) Set forth the rates for the plan, if the advertisements discuss 
benefits.

<R05>
Sec. 1604.7201  FEHB Program Large Provider Agreements.

    The following provisions apply to all experience-rated carriers 
participating in the FEHB Program:
    (a) Notification and information requirements. (1) All experience-
rated carriers must provide notice to the contracting officer of their 
intent to enter into or to make a significant modification to a Large 
Provider Agreement. Significant modification means a 20% increase or 
more in the amount of the Large Provider Agreement:
    (i) Not less than 60 days before entering into any Large Provider 
Agreement; and
    (ii) Not less than 60 days before exercising renewals or other 
options, or making a significant modification.
    (2) The carrier's notification to the contracting officer must be in 
writing and must, at a minimum:
    (i) Describe the supplies and/or services the proposed provider 
agreement will require;
    (ii) Identify the proposed basis for reimbursement;
    (iii) Identify the proposed provider agreement, explain why the 
carrier selected the proposed provider, and, where applicable, what 
contracting method it used, including the kind of competition obtained;
    (iv) Describe the methodology the carrier used to compute the 
provider's profit; and, (v) Describe the provider risk provisions.
    (3) The contracting officer may request from the carrier any 
additional information on a proposed provider agreement and its terms 
and conditions prior to a Large Provider award and during the 
performance of the agreement.
    (4) Within 30 days of receiving the carrier's notification, the 
contracting officer will either give the carrier written comments or 
written notice that there will be no comments. If the contracting 
officer comments, the carrier must respond in writing within 10 calendar 
days and explain how it intends to address any concerns.
    (5) When computing the carrier's annual service charge, the 
contracting officer will consider how well the carrier complies with the 
provisions of this section, including the advance notification 
requirements, as an aspect of the carrier's performance factor.
    (6) The contracting officer's review of any Large Provider 
agreement, option, renewal, or modification will not constitute a 
determination of the acceptability of terms or conditions of any 
provider agreement or the allowability of any costs under the carrier's 
contract, nor will it relieve the carrier of any responsibility for 
performing the contract.
    (b) Records and inspection. The carrier must insert in all Large 
Provider Agreements the requirement that the provider will retain and 
make available to the Government all records relating to the agreement 
as follows:
    (1) Records that support the annual statement of operations--Retain 
for 6 years after the agreement term ends.
    (2) Enrollee records, if applicable--Retain for 6 years after the 
agreement term ends.
    (c) Large Provider Agreements based on cost analysis are subject to 
the provisions of FAR 52.215-2, ``Audit and Records-Negotiation.''
    (d) Large Provider Agreements based on price analysis are subject to 
the provisions of 48 CFR 1646.301 and 1652.246-70.


<R05>
Sec. 1604.7202  Large Provider Agreement clause.

Sec. 1609.470  Notification of Debarment, Suspension, and Ineligibility.

    (FAR) 48 CFR, part 9, subpart 9.4 is supplemented as set out in the 
certification required in 1609.471 by converting the FAR ``offeror's'' 
certification at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.209-5 into a carrier's certification. 
This change reflects the FEHBP's statutory exemption from competitive 
bidding (5 U.S.C. 8902), which obviates the issuance of solicitations.


<R05>
Sec. 1609.471  Contractor certification.

    All FEHBP carriers and applicant carriers are required to submit the 
following certification. Applicant carriers must submit the 
certification prior to OPM's determination on the application for 
approval to participate in the FEHBP. Current carriers must submit the 
certification once, along with their benefit and rate proposals for the 
1995 contract year.

  Debarment, Suspension, Proposed Debarment, and Other Responsibility 
                                 Matters

    The Carrier certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, 
that--
    (a) The Carrier and/or any of its Principals--
    (1) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for 
debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any 
Federal agency;
    (2) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a 3-year period preceding this 
certification, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered 
against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in 
connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public 
(Federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal 
or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or 
commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or 
destruction of records, making false statements, or receiving stolen 
property; and
    (3) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise 
criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission 
of

[[Page 123]]

any of the offenses enumerated in subdivision (a)(2) of this clause.
    (4) The Carrier has ( ) has not ( ), within a 3-year period 
preceding this certification, had one or more contracts terminated for 
default by any Federal agency.
    (b) Principals, for the purposes of this certification, means 
officers; directors; owners; partners; and persons having primary 
management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity 
(e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, 
or business segment, and similar positions).
    This certification concerns a matter within the jurisdiction of an 
agency of the United States and the making of a false, fictitious, or 
fraudulent certification may render the Carrier subject to prosecution 
under section 1001, title 18, United States Code.
    (c) The Carrier shall provide immediate written notice to the 
Contracting Officer if, at any time, the Carrier learns that its 
certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by 
reason of changed circumstances.
    (d) A Carrier's certification that any of the actions mentioned in 
the certification exists will not necessarily result in termination of 
the contract. However, the certification, or the Carrier's failure to 
provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting 
Officer, will be considered in connection with a determination of the 
Carrier's responsibility under subpart 1609.70, Minimum Standards for 
Health Benefits Carriers.
    (e) Nothing contained in the certification shall be construed to 
require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good 
faith, the certification required by this section. The knowledge and 
information of the Carrier is not required to exceed that which is 
normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of 
business dealings.
    (f) The certification in this section is a material representation 
of fact upon which reliance is placed by the Contracting Officer. If it 
is later determined that the Carrier knowingly rendered an erroneous 
certification, in addition to other remedies available to the 
Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract for 
default.

     Subpart 1609.70_Minimum Standards for Health Benefits Carriers


<R05>
Sec. 1609.7001  Minimum standards for health benefits carriers.

    (a) The carrier of an approved health benefits plan shall meet the 
requirements of chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code; part 890 of 
title 5, Code of Federal Regulations; chapter 1 of title 48, Code of 
Federal Regulations, and the following standards. The carrier shall 
continue to meet the requirements of chapter 89 of title 5, United 
States Code, and the standards cited in this paragraph while under 
contract with OPM. Failure to meet these requirements and standards is 
cause for OPM's withdrawal of approval of the health benefits carrier 
and termination of the contract in accordance with 5 CFR 890.204.
    (1) It must be lawfully engaged in the business of supplying health 
benefits.
    (2) It must have, in the judgement of OPM, the financial resources 
and experience in the field of health benefits to carry out its 
obligations under the plan.
    (3) It must keep such reasonable financial and statistical records, 
and furnish such reasonable financial and statistical reports with 
respect to the plan, as may be requested by OPM.
    (4) It must permit representatives of OPM and of the General 
Accounting Office to audit and examine its records and accounts which 
pertain, directly or indirectly, to the plan at such reasonable times 
and places as may be designated by OPM or the General Accounting Office.
    (5) It must accept, subject to adjustment for error or fraud, in 
payment of its charges for health benefits for all enrollees in its 
plan, the enrollment charges received by the Employees Health Benefits 
(EHB) Fund less amounts set aside for the administrative and contingency 
reserves prescribed in 5 CFR 890.503. OPM makes available or pays the 
amounts within 30 days of receipt by the EHB Fund.
    (6) A carrier that is an employee organization must continue 
coverage, without requirement of membership, of

[[Page 124]]

any eligible survivor annuitants, former spouses continuing coverage 
with the carrier under 5 CFR 890.803, children temporarily continuing 
coverage with the carrier under 5 CFR 890.1103(a)(2), or former spouses 
temporarily continuing coverage with the carrier under 5 CFR 
890.1103(a)(3).
    (7) It must timely submit to OPM a properly completed and signed 
novation or change-of-name agreement in accordance with subpart 1642.12 
of this chapter.
    (b) In addition to the standards in paragraph (a) of this section, 
the carrier must perform the contract in accordance with prudent 
business practices. A carrier's sustained poor business practice in the 
management or administration of a health benefits plan is cause for 
OPM's withdrawal of approval of the health benefits carrier and 
termination of the carrier's contract. Prudent business practices 
include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (1) Timely compliance with OPM instructions and directives.
    (2) Legal and ethical business and health care practices.
    (3) Compliance with the terms of the FEHB contract, regulations and 
statutes.
    (4) Timely and accurate adjudication of claims or rendering of 
medical services.
    (5) A system for accounting for costs incurred under the contract, 
when required, which includes segregating and pricing FEHB medical 
utilization and allocating indirect and administrative costs in a 
reasonable and equitable manner.
    (6) Accurate accounting reports of actual, allowable, allocable, and 
reasonable costs incurred in the administration of the contract.
    (7) Application of performance standards for assuring contract 
quality as required by 1646.270(d).
    (8) Establishment and maintenance of a system of internal control 
that provides reasonable assurance that:
    (i) The provision and payments of benefits and other expenses are in 
compliance with legal, regulatory, and contractual guidelines;
    (ii) FEHB funds, property, and other assets are safeguarded against 
waste, loss, unauthorized use, or misappropriation; and,
    (iii) Data are accurately and fairly disclosed in all reports 
required by OPM.
    (c) The following types of activities are examples of poor business 
practices which adversely affect the health benefits carrier's 
responsibility under its contract. A pattern of poor conduct or evidence 
of misconduct in these areas is cause for OPM to withdraw approval of 
the carrier:
    (1) Presenting false claims by charging expenses to the contract 
which according to the contract terms are not chargeable to the 
contract;
    (2) Using fraudulent or unethical business or health care practices 
or otherwise displaying a lack of business integrity or honesty;
    (3) Repeatedly and knowingly providing false or misleading 
information in the rate setting process;
    (4) Repeated failure to comply with OPM instructions and directives;
    (5) Having an accounting system that is incapable of separately 
accounting for costs incurred under the contract and/or that lacks the 
internal controls necessary to fulfill the terms of the contract; and
    (6) Failure to assure that the plan provides properly paid or denied 
claims, or providing medical services which are inconsistent with 
standards of good medical practice.
    (7) Entering into contracts or employment agreements with providers, 
provider groups, or health care workers that include provisions or 
financial incentives that directly or indirectly create an inducement to 
limit or restrict communication about medically necessary services to 
any individual covered under the FEHB Program. Financial incentives are 
defined as bonuses, withholds, commissions, profit sharing or other 
similar adjustments to basic compensation (e.g., service fee, 
capitation, salary) which have the effect of limiting or reducing 
communication about appropriate medically necessary services. Providers, 
health care workers, or health plan sponsoring organizations are not 
required to discuss treatment options that they would not ordinarily 
discuss in their customary course of practice because such options

[[Page 125]]

are inconsistent with their professional judgment or ethical, moral or 
religious beliefs.
    (d) The Director or his or her designee will determine whether to 
propose withdrawal of approval and hold a hearing based on the 
seriousness of the carrier's actions and its proposed method to effect 
corrective action.

<R05>
Sec. 1609.7101  Policy.

    At the end of each contract period, the contracting officer will 
determine each community-rated carrier's responsiveness to the Program 
requirements in 1609.7101-1.


<R05>
Sec. 1609.7101-1  Community-rated carrier incentive performance 
          elements.

    (a) Customer Service. This element is intended to assist OPM in 
achieving the goal of providing customer service that meets or exceeds 
the expectations of Federal enrollees. The Customer Service category 
will represent 70 percent of the total calculation and will be based on 
the carrier's compliance with the following items:
    (1) Timely Closure on Rates and Benefits Consistent with Policy 
Guidelines. In order for information to be available to our customers in 
time for the annual Open Season, carriers must work with OPM to conclude 
benefits and rate negotiations by the established time frames. The 
contracting officer will evaluate this item based on the carrier's 
demonstrated record in providing its rate reconciliation and benefits 
information within the time frames prescribed by and in the format 
required by OPM.
    (2) Customer Information. Enrollees must have accurate information 
and adequate time to make informed Open Season choices in selecting a 
health plan. In evaluating this item, the contracting officer will 
consider the carrier's timeliness and accuracy of information.
    (3) Meeting Customer Service Performance Standards. Compliance with 
this item is essential so that OPM can ensure that the carrier is 
providing quality health care and other services to enrollees. The 
contracting officer will evaluate this item based on the carrier's 
submission of the Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Study (CAHPS) 
survey results and other measures as required contractually between OPM 
and the carrier. (This element will be implemented beginning with 
contract year 2000).
    (4) Cooperation in Surveys. FEHB enrollees rely on feedback from the 
consumer assessment survey in selecting a health plan. The contracting 
officer will evaluate this item based on the carrier's record in 
cooperating with OPM and/or its designated representative in 
administering a consumer assessment survey or providing comparable 
survey results as specified in the FEHB contract and OPM guidance.
    (5) Paperless Enrollment/Enrollment Reconciliation--(i) Paperless 
Enrollment. The requirement to cooperate in the OPM designated system 
for paperless enrollment is under the section entitled ``Enrollment 
Instructions'' in the FEHB Supplemental Literature Guidelines in the 
FEHB contract. The contracting officer will evaluate this item based on 
the carrier's ability to accept electronic data transmission from the 
OPM designated electronic enrollment system and issue ID cards timely.
    (ii) Enrollment Reconciliation. The requirement for carriers to 
reconcile their enrollment records on a quarterly basis with those 
provided by Federal Government agencies is in the Records and 
Information to be Furnished by OPM clause of the contract, as well as 5 
CFR 890.110 and 5 CFR 890.308. The contracting officer will evaluate 
this item based on the carrier's demonstrated record of initiating 
reconciliation procedures with applicable agency payroll offices on a 
quarterly basis in accordance with OPM guidance on reconciling 
enrollments and resolving enrollment discrepancies, as well as on the 
carrier's demonstrated record of following disenrollment procedures in 
accordance with 5 CFR 890.110 and 890.308.

[[Page 126]]

    (6) Reconsideration/Disputed Claims. The requirement for carriers to 
reconsider disputed health benefits claims is in 5 CFR 890.105. An 
incomplete explanation of denied benefits by the carrier places a burden 
on enrollees, causing them to seek reconsideration because the carrier 
did not fully explain its denial. Late carrier responses to OPM's 
requests for the carrier's reconsideration file delays OPM's response to 
enrollees. The contracting officer will evaluate this item based on 
whether the carrier provided OPM a complete reconciliation file within 
the time frame specified.
    (b) Critical Contract Compliance Requirements. This performance 
category will represent 30 percent of the total computation and will be 
based on the carrier's compliance with the following items:
    (1) Timely Submissions. The reports specified in the Statistics and 
Special Studies and FEHB Quality Assurance clauses of the contract and 
are essential for tracking enrollment, finances, rates, etc. In 
evaluating this item, the contracting officer will consider the 
carrier's timely submission of the contract, signed by the contracting 
official, to OPM, and on its demonstrated record in providing timely and 
accurate reports as required.
    (2) Notification of Changes in Contract Administrators. OPM must be 
able to reach the person responsible for managing the carrier's FEHB 
contract without delay when an enrollee calls OPM in need of urgent 
medical treatment, an ID card, or other service. Each carrier's 
designated contact must maintain telephone and electronic communications 
with OPM so that issues can be resolved quickly. The contracting officer 
will evaluate this item based on the carrier's compliance with the 
Notice clause and Contract Administration Data sheet in the contract, 
and will consider the carrier's record in notifying OPM promptly of 
changes in its carrier representative or contracting official, mailing 
or electronic address, telephone or FAX number.
    (3) Notification of Changes in Name or Ownership; or Transfer of 
Assets, and Notification of Other Significant Events. OPM must be able 
to assess the viability of the carrier and its ability to provide health 
care to enrollees so that they do not experience difficulty obtaining 
treatment and other services. Additionally, with regard to notification 
to OPM of other significant events, the carrier must notify OPM of such 
events as lawsuits, strikes, and natural disasters so that OPM can 
assess the carrier's ability to pay claims and provide services to 
enrollees. The contracting officer will evaluate this item based on the 
carrier's compliance with FEHBAR Subparts 1642.12, Novation and Change-
of-Name Agreements, 1642.70, Management Agreement (in Lieu of Novation 
Agreement), and 1652.222-70, including timely notification and 
explanation of all significant events that may have a material effect on 
the carrier's ability to perform the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 1609.7101-2  Community-rated carrier performance factors.

    OPM will apply the Customer Service and Critical Contract Compliance 
Requirements percentage factors specified by the contracting officer 
when a community-rated carrier does not provide the information, 
payment, or service, perform the function, or otherwise meet its 
obligations as stated in 1609.7101-1. The total premium will be 
multiplied by the sum of all the factors and the resulting amount will 
be withheld from the carrier's periodic premium payments payable during 
the first quarter of the following contract period, unless an 
alternative payment arrangement is made with the carrier's contracting 
officer.

    Source: 70 FR 31380, June 1, 2005, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1615.402  Pricing policy.

    Pricing of FEHB contracts is governed by 5 U.S.C. 8902(i), 5 U.S.C. 
8906, and other applicable law. FAR subpart 15.4 will be implemented by 
applying its policies and procedures--to the extent practicable--as 
follows:
    (a) For both experience-rated and community-rated contracts for 
which the FEHB Program premiums for the contract term will be less than 
the threshold at FAR 15.403-4(a)(1), OPM will not require the carrier to 
provide cost or pricing data in the rate proposal for the following 
contract term.
    (b) Cost analysis will be used for contracts where premiums and 
subscription income are determined on the basis of experience rating.
    (c)(1) A combination of cost and price analysis will be used for 
contracts where premiums and subscription income are based on community-
rates. For contracts for which the FEHB Program premiums for the 
contract term will be less than the threshold at FAR 15.403-4(a)(1), OPM 
will not require the carrier to provide cost or pricing data. The 
carrier is required to submit only a rate proposal and abbreviated 
utilization data for the applicable contract year. OPM will evaluate the 
proposed rates by performing a basic reasonableness test on the 
information submitted. Rates failing this test will be subject to 
further review.
    (2) For contracts with fewer than 1,500 enrollee contracts for which 
the FEHB Program premiums for the contract term will be at or above the 
threshold at FAR 15.403-4(a)(1), OPM will require the carrier to submit 
its rate proposal, utilization data, and the certificate of accurate 
cost or pricing data required in 1615.406-2. In addition, OPM will 
require the carrier to complete the proposed rates form containing cost 
and pricing data, and the Community-Rate Questionnaire, but will not 
require the carrier to send these documents to OPM. The carrier will 
keep the documents on file for periodic auditor and actuarial review in 
accordance with 1652.204-70. OPM will perform a basic reasonableness 
test on the data submitted. Rates that do not pass this test will be 
subject to further OPM review.
    (3) For contracts with 1,500 or more enrollee contracts for which 
the FEHB Program premiums for the contract term will be at or above the 
threshold at FAR 15.403-4(a)(1), OPM will require the carrier to provide 
the data and methodology used to determine the FEHB Program rates. OPM 
will also require the data and methodology used to determine the rates 
for the carrier's similarly sized subscriber groups. The carrier will 
provide cost or pricing data required by OPM in its rate instructions 
for the applicable contract period. OPM will evaluate the data to ensure 
that the rate is reasonable and consistent with the requirements in this 
chapter. If necessary, OPM may require the carrier to provide additional 
documentation.
    (4) Contracts will be subject to a downward price adjustment if OPM 
determines that the Federal group was charged more than it would have 
been charged using a methodology consistent with that used for the 
similarly-sized subscriber groups (SSSGs). Such adjustments will be 
based on the lower of the two rates determined by using the methodology 
(including discounts) the carrier used for the two SSSGs.
    (5) FEHB Program community-rated carriers will comply with SSSG 
criteria provided by OPM in the rate instructions for the applicable 
contract period.
    (d) The application of FAR 15.402(b)(2) should not be construed to 
prohibit the consideration of preceding year surpluses or deficits in 
carrier-held reserves in the rate adjustments for subsequent year 
renewals of contracts based, in whole or in part, on cost analysis.


<R05>
Sec. 1615.404-4  Profit.

    (a) When the pricing of FEHB Program contracts is determined by cost 
analysis, OPM will determine the profit or fee prenegotiation objective 
(service charge) portion of the contracts by use of a weighted 
guidelines structured

[[Page 129]]

approach. The service charge so determined will be the total service 
charge that may be negotiated for the contract and will encompass any 
service charge (whether entitled service charge, profit, fee, 
contribution to reserves or surpluses, or any other title) that may have 
been negotiated by the prime contractor with any subcontractor or 
underwriter.
    (b) OPM will not guarantee a minimum service charge.


<R05>
Sec. 1615.404-70  Profit analysis factors.

    (a) OPM contracting officers will apply a weighted guidelines method 
in developing the service charge prenegotiation objective for FEHB 
Program contracts. The following factors, as defined in FAR 15.404-4(d), 
will be applied to projected incurred claims and allowable 
administrative expenses:
    (1) Contractor performance. OPM will consider such elements as the 
accurate and timely processing of benefit claims and the volume and 
validity of disputed claims as measures of economical and efficient 
contract performance. This factor will be judged apart from the 
contractor's basic responsibility for contract performance and will be a 
measure of the extent and nature of the contractor's contribution to the 
FEHB Program through the application of managerial expertise and effort. 
Evidence of effective contract performance will receive a plus weight, 
and poor performance or failure to comply with contract terms and 
conditions a negative weight. Innovations of benefit to the FEHB Program 
will generally result in a positive weight; documented inattention or 
indifference to cost control will generally result in a negative weight.
    (2) Contract cost risk. In assessing the degree of cost 
responsibility and associated risk assumed by the contractor as a factor 
to be considered in negotiating profit, OPM will consider such 
underwriting elements as the availability of margins, group size, 
enrollment demographics and fluctuation, and the probability of 
conversion and adverse selection, as well as the extent of financial 
assistance the carrier renders to the contract. However, the ``loss 
carry forward basis'' of experience-rated group insurance practices, 
which mitigates contract risk, will likely serve to diminish this profit 
analysis factor in an overall determination of profit. This factor is 
intended to provide profit opportunities commensurate with the 
contractor's share of cost risks only, taking into account elements such 
as the adequacy and reliability of data for estimating costs.
    (3) Federal socioeconomic programs. OPM will consider documented 
evidence of successful, contractor-initiated efforts to support Federal 
socioeconomic programs such as drug and substance abuse deterrents and 
concerns of the type enumerated in FAR 15.404-4(d)(iii), as a factor in 
negotiating profit. This factor will be assessed by considering the 
quality of the contractor's policies and procedures and the extent of 
unusual effort or achievement demonstrated. Evidence of effective 
support of Federal socioeconomic programs will receive a positive 
weight; poor support will receive a negative weight.
    (4) Capital investments. This factor is generally not applicable to 
FEHB Program contracts because facilities capital cost of money may be 
an allowable administrative expense. Generally, this factor will be 
given a weight of zero. However, special purpose facilities or 
investment costs of direct benefit to the FEHB Program that are not 
recoverable as allowable or allocable administrative expenses may be 
taken into account in assigning a positive weight.
    (5) Cost control. OPM will consider contractor-initiated efforts 
such as improved benefit design, cost-sharing features, innovative peer 
review, or other professional cost containment efforts as a factor in 
negotiating profit. OPM will use this factor to reward contractors with 
additional profit opportunities for self-initiated efforts to control 
contract costs.
    (6) Independent development. OPM will consider any profit 
opportunities that may be directly related to relevant independent 
efforts such as the development of a unique and enhanced customer 
support system that is of demonstrated value to the FEHB Program and for 
which developmental costs

[[Page 130]]

have not been recovered directly or indirectly through allowable 
administrative expenses. OPM will use this factor to provide additional 
profit opportunities based upon an assessment of the contractor's 
investment and risk in developing techniques, methods, and practices 
having viability to the program at large. OPM will not consider 
improvements and innovations recognized and rewarded under any of the 
other profit factors.
    (b) The following weight ranges for each factor are used in the 
weighted guidelines approach:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Profit factor                  Weight ranges  (percent)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Contractor performance...................  -.2 to + .45
2. Contract cost risk *.....................  +.02 to + .2
3. Federal socioeconomic programs...........  -.05 to + .05
4. Capital investments......................  0 to + .02
5. Cost control.............................  0 to + .35
6. Independent development..................  0 to + .03
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    *The contract cost risk factor is subdivided into two parts: group 
size (.02 to .10) and other risk elements (0 to .10). With respect to 
the group size element, subweights should be assigned as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Enrollment                        Weight  (percent)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
10,000 or less..............................  .06 to .10
10,001-50,000...............................  .05 to .09
50,001-200,000..............................  .04 to .07
200,001-500,000.............................  .03 to .06
500,001 and over............................  .02 to .04

Sec. 1615.406-2  Certificate of accurate cost or pricing data for 
          community-rated carriers.

    The contracting officer will require a carrier with a contract 
meeting the requirements in 1615.402(c)(2) or 1615.402(c)(3) to execute 
the Certificate of Accurate Cost or Pricing Data contained in this 
section. A carrier with a contract meeting the requirements in 
1615.402(c)(2) will complete the Certificate and keep it on file at the 
carrier's place of business in accordance with 1652.204-70. A carrier 
with a contract meeting the requirements in 1615.402(c)(3) will submit 
the Certificate to OPM along with its rate reconciliation, which is 
submitted during the first quarter of the applicable contract year.

    Certificate of Accurate Cost or Pricing Data for Community-Rated 
                                Carriers

    This is to certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief: (1) 
The cost or pricing data submitted (or, if not submitted, maintained and 
identified by the carrier as supporting documentation) to the 
Contracting officer or the Contracting officer's representative or 
designee, in support of the --------*FEHB Program rates were developed 
in accordance with the requirements of 48 CFR Chapter 16 and the FEHB 
Program contract and are accurate, complete, and current as of the date 
this certificate is executed; and (2) the methodology used to determine 
the FEHB Program rates is consistent with the methodology used to 
determine the rates for the carrier's Similarly Sized Subscriber Groups.

<R05>
Sec. 1615.470  Carrier investment of FEHB funds.

    (a) Except for contracts based on a combination of cost and price 
analysis (community-rated), the carrier is required to invest and 
reinvest all funds on hand, including any attributable to the special 
reserve or the reserve for incurred but unpaid claims, exceeding the 
funds needed to discharge promptly the obligations incurred under the 
contract.
    (b) The carrier is required to credit income earned from its 
investment of FEHB funds to the special reserve on behalf of the FEHB 
Program. If a carrier, for any reason, fails to invest excess FEHB funds 
or to credit any income due to the contract, it will return or credit 
any investment income lost to OPM or the special reserve.
    (c) Investment income. Investment income is the net amount earned by

<R05>
Sec. 1631.203-70  Allocation techniques.

    (a) Carriers shall use the following methods for allocating 
groupings of business unit indirect costs. Carriers shall consistently 
apply the methods and techniques established to classify direct and 
indirect costs, to group indirect costs and to allocate indirect costs 
to cost objectives.
    (1) Input method. The preferred allocation technique is one that 
shows the consumption of resources in performance of the activities 
(input) for the function(s) represented by the cost grouping. This 
allocation technique should be used in circumstances where there is a 
direct and definitive relationship between the function(s) and the 
benefiting cost objectives. Measures of input ordinarily may be 
expressed in terms such as labor hours or square footage. This means 
costs may be allocated by use of a rate, such as a rate per labor hour 
or cost per square foot.
    (2) Output method. Where input measures are unavailable or 
impractical to determine, the basis for allocation may be a measure of 
the output of the function(s) represented by the cost grouping. The 
output becomes a substitute measure for the use of resources and is a 
reasonable alternative when a direct measure of input is impractical. 
Output may be measured in terms of units of end product produced by the 
function(s). Examples of output measures include number of claims 
processed by a claims processing center, number of pages printed in a 
print shop, number of purchase orders processed by a purchasing 
department, or number of hires by a personnel office.
    (3) Surrogate method. Where neither activity (input) nor output of 
the function(s) can be measured practically, a surrogate must be used to 
measure the resources utilized. Surrogates used to represent the 
relationship generally measure the benefit to the cost objectives 
receiving the service and should vary in proportion to the services 
received. For example, if a personnel department provides various 
services that cannot be measured practically on an activity (input) or 
output basis, number of personnel served might reasonably represent the 
use of resources of the personnel function for the cost objectives 
receiving the service, where this base varies in proportion to the 
services performed.
    (4) Other method. Some cost groupings cannot readily be allocated on 
measures of specific beneficial or causal relationships under paragraph 
(a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section. Such costs do not have a 
direct and definitive relationship to the benefiting cost objectives. 
Generally, the cost of overall management activities falls in this 
category. Overall management costs should be grouped in relation to the 
activities managed. The base selected to measure the allocation of these 
indirect costs to cost objectives should be a base representative of the 
entire activity being managed. For example, the total operating expenses 
of activities managed might be a reasonable base for allocating the 
general indirect costs of a business unit. Another reasonable method for 
allocating general indirect costs might be to base them on a percentage 
of contracts. These examples are not meant to be exhaustive, but rather 
are examples of allocation methods that may be acceptable under 
individual circumstances. See also General and Administrative (G&A) 
expenses, FEHBAR 1631.203-71.
    (b) Carriers that use multiple cost centers to accumulate and 
allocate costs shall apply the techniques in paragraph (a) of this 
section at each step of the allocation process. Accordingly, the 
allocation of costs among cost centers at the initial entry into the 
cost accounting system shall be made in compliance with paragraph (a) of 
this section. Likewise, the allocation of the cost of interim cost 
centers to final cost centers is subject to paragraph (a) of this 
section. If costs of final cost centers are allocated among final cost 
objectives, the allocation shall also be made in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section. It is possible that carriers using 
multiple cost centers to accumulate and allocate costs may not have any 
direct costs, i.e., costs identified specifically with a final cost 
objective.
    (c) The allocation of business unit general and administrative 
expenses and the allocation of home office expenses to segments are also 
subject to

[[Page 135]]

FEHBAR 1631.203-71 and FEHBAR 1631.203-72, respectively.

Sec. 1631.203-72  Home office expense.

    A carrier's practices for allocating home office expenses to the 
segments of the carrier will be acceptable for purposes of FAR 31.203 if 
they are allocated on the basis of the beneficial or causal relationship 
between the home office activities and the segments to which the 
expenses are allocated. Expenses that cannot be allocated on the basis 
of a more specific beneficial or causal relationship should be allocated 
on a basis representative of the entire activity being managed. The 
compliance of such allocations with FAR 31.203 shall be determined on 
the basis of the facts and circumstances of each situation.

    For the purposes of FAR 31.205-10(b)(3), the estimated facilities

the prior year's Annual Accounting Statement or, for new experience-
rated carriers, the supplemental information supporting submitted costs 
(such as the Supplemental Schedule of Administrative Expenses).

Sec. 1631.205-41  Taxes.

    5 U.S.C. 8909(f)(1) prohibits the imposition of taxes, fees, or 
other monetary payment, directly or indirectly, on FEHB premiums by any 
State, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or 
by any political subdivision or other governmental authority of those 
entities. Therefore, FAR 31.205-41 is modified to include those taxes as 
unallowable costs. The prohibited payments, referred to elsewhere in 
these regulations as ``premium taxes,'' applies to all payments directed 
by States or municipalities, regardless of how they may be titled, to 
whom they must be paid, or the purpose for which they are collected, and 
it applies to all forms of direct and indirect measurements on FEHBP 
premiums, however modified, to include cost per contract or enrollee, 
with the sole exception of a tax on net income or profit, if that tax, 
fee, or payment is applicable to a broad range of business activity.

[56 FR 57496, Nov. 12, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 1631.205-70  FEHBP public relations and advertising costs.

    (a) The cost of media messages that are directed at advising current 
FEHBP subscribers on how to obtain benefits shall be an allowable 
expense within the meaning of FAR 31.205-1 because this service is 
directly related to performance of the FEHBP contract. If there is any 
question about the allowability of such a cost, the carrier may request 
advance approval regarding the content and cost of the message.
    (b) Costs of media messages not provided for in paragraph (a) of 
this section are allowable if the content is specifically approved by 
the contracting officer and all of the following criteria are met:
    (1) The primary effect of the message is to disseminate information 
on health care cost containment or preventive health care;
    (2) The costs of the carrier's messages are allocated to all 
underwritten and non-underwritten lines of business; and
    (3) The contracting officer approves the total dollar amount of the 
carrier's messages to be charged to the FEHBP in advance of the contract 
year.
    (c) Costs of messages that are intended to, or which have the 
primary effect of, calling favorable attention to the carrier (or 
subcontractor) for the purpose of enhancing its overall image or selling 
its health plan are not allowable.

    Erroneous benefit payments are not automatically disallowed by FAR 
31.205-3.


<R05>
Sec. 1631.205-72  FEHBP compensation for personal services.

    (a) Overtime on an FEHBP contract would normally meet the condition 
specified in FAR 22.103. Premiums for overtime, extra-pay shifts, and 
multi-shifts meeting the specified conditions shall be allowed without 
prior approval.
    (b)(1) The costs of compensated personal absence shall be assigned 
to the cost accounting period or periods in which entitlement was 
earned. Entitlement means an employee's right, whether conditional or 
unconditional, to receive a determinable amount of compensated personal 
absence, or pay in lieu thereof.
    (2) If at the beginning of the 1st year a carrier subject to 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section has a liability for accrued but unpaid 
expenses for compensated personal absences that would otherwise be 
allocable to FEHB contracts, the carrier may include such costs in a 
suspense account. The suspense account may be amortized and included in 
government contract costs at a rate not exceeding 20 percent per year.

<R05>
Sec. 1631.205-73  FEHBP interest expense.

    (a) Interest charges incurred in the administration of FEHBP 
contracts are not allowable in accordance with FAR 31.205-20. However, 
interest charges that are associated with the carrier's investment of 
FEHBP account funds are not considered administrative costs and may be 
allowable under very limited circumstances if all of the following 
criteria are met:
    (1) Borrowing is limited to the positive balance of the carrier's 
entire FEHBP investment portfolio;
    (2) FEHBP funds are tied up in long-term securities;
    (3) Liquidation of long-term securities would cost more than the 
cost of the interest;
    (4) The interest rates charged are at or below current market rates; 
and
    (5) Advance written approval of the contracting officer is obtained 
before such costs are incurred.
    (b) The carrier must demonstrate on a case-by-case basis that 
borrowing rather than cashing in long-term investments shall actually 
result in cost savings to the FEHB Program. Satisfactory demonstration 
of cost savings is a prerequisite to contracting officer approval of the 
interest cost as a charge to the contract.
    (c) If the interest charge is allowed, the risk factor in the 
service charge will be adjusted downward so that the carrier does not 
recover interest costs through both the service charge and an allowance 
under this paragraph.


<R05>
Sec. 1631.205-74  FEHBP losses on other contracts.

    FAR 31.205-23 shall not be construed to prohibit the application of 
the normal ``loss carry forward'' principle that is fundamental to 
continuing insurance contracts that are based on experience rating.


<R05>
Sec. 1631.205-75  Selling costs.

    (a) FAR 31.205-38 is modified to eliminate from allowable costs 
those costs related to sales promotion and the payment of sales 
commissions fees or salaries to employees or outside commercial or 
selling agencies for enrolling Federal subscribers in a particular FEHB 
plan.
    (b) Selling costs are allowable costs to FEHBP contracts to the 
extent that they are necessary for conducting annual contract 
negotiations with the Government and for liaison activities necessary 
for ongoing contract administration. Personnel and related travel costs 
are allowable for attendance at Open Season Health fairs and other 
similar activities at which carriers give enrollees information about 
their choices among health plans (but see FAR 31.205-1 `Public relations 
and advertising costs', and The Federal Employees Health Benefits 
Handbook for Personnel and Payroll Offices, Subchapter S2-3(f) 
`Controlling contacts between employees and carriers').

<R05>
Sec. 1631.205-76  Trade, business, technical, and professional activity 
          costs.

    (a) FEHBP participating plans, carriers, and underwriters shall seek 
the advance written approval of the contracting officer for allowability 
of all or part of the costs associated with trade, business, technical, 
and professional activities (FAR 31.205-43) when the allocable costs of 
such participation to the FEHBP will exceed $1,000 annually and when the 
carrier or underwriter allocates more than 50% of the membership cost of 
a trade, business, technical, or professional organization to the FEHBP.
    (b) When approval of costs for membership in an organization is 
required, the carrier or underwriter must demonstrate conclusively that 
membership in such an organization and participation in its activities 
extend beyond the contractual relationship with OPM, have a reasonable 
relationship to providing care and services to FEHBP enrollees, and that 
the organization is not engaged in activities such as those cited in FAR 
31.205-22 (lobbying costs) for which costs are not allowable.


<R05>
Sec. 1631.205-77  FEHBP start-up and other nonrecurring costs.

    Precontract costs (FAR 31.205-32) shall be allowed only to the 
extent provided for by advance agreement in accordance with FAR 31.109.


<R05>
Sec. 1631.205-78  FEHBP printed material costs.

    Unless OPM determines that it is in the best interest of the FEHBP 
to do otherwise, if a carrier orders printed material that is available 
from the Government Printing Office (GPO) under the ``rider system'' 
from another source, the allowable contract charges shall be the lesser 
of the amount actually paid or the cost that would have been incurred 
had the carrier ridden OPM's GPO order.


<R05>
Sec. 1631.205-79  Mandatory statutory reserves.

    Charges for mandatory statutory reserves are not allowed unless 
provided for in the contract. When the term ``mandatory statutory 
reserve'' is specifically identified as an allowable contract charge 
without further definition or explanation, it means a requirement 
imposed by State law upon the carrier to set aside a specific amount or 
rate of funds into a restricted reserve that is accounted for separately 
from all other reserves and surpluses of the carrier and which may be 
used only with the specific approval of the State official designated by 
law to make such approvals. The amount chargeable to the contract may 
not exceed an allocable portion of the amount actually set aside. If the 
statutory reserve is no longer required for the purpose for which it was 
created, and these funds become available for the general use of the 
carrier, a pro rata share based upon FEHBP's contribution to the total 
carrier's set aside shall be returned to the FEHBP in accordance with 
FAR 31.201-5.


<R05>
Sec. 1631.205-80  Major subcontractor service charges.

    In a subcontract for enrollment and eligibility determinations, 
administration of claims and payment of benefits, and payment or 
provision of actual health services, and/or assumption of insurance risk 
or underwriting, when costs are determined on the basis of actual costs 
incurred or experience rating, any amount that exceeds the allowable 
cost of the subcontract (whether entitled service charge, profit, fee, 
contribution to reserve, surplus, or any other title) is not allowable 
under the contract. Amounts which exceed allowable costs may be paid to 
a major subcontractor only from the service charge negotiated between 
OPM and the Carrier.


<R05>
Sec. 1631.205-81  Inferred reasonableness.

    If the carrier follows the notification and consent requirements of 
paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of 1652.244-70, and subsequently obtains the 
Contracting officer's consent or ratification, then the reasonableness 
of the subcontract's costs shall be inferred.

<R05>
Sec. 1632.170  Recurring premium payments to carriers.

    (a)(1) Recurring payments to carriers of community-rated plans. OPM 
will pay to carriers of community-rated plans the premium payments 
received for the plan less the amounts credited to the contingency and 
administrative reserves, amounts assessed under paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, and amounts due for other contractual obligations. Premium 
payments will be due and payable not later than 30 days after receipt by 
the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Fund.
    (2) The sum of the two performance factors applicable under 
1609.7101-2 will be multiplied by the carrier's total net-to-carrier 
premium dollars paid for the preceding contract period. The amount 
obtained after the total premium is multiplied by the sum of the factors 
will be withheld from the carrier's periodic premium payment payable 
during the first quarter of the following contract period unless an 
alternative payment arrangement is made with the carrier's contracting 
officer. OPM will deposit the withheld funds in the carrier's 
contingency reserve for the plan. The aggregate amount withheld annually 
for performance for any carrier will not exceed one percent of premium 
for any contract period.
    (b)(1) Recurring payments to carriers of experience-rated plans. OPM 
will make payments on a letter of credit (LOC) basis. Premium payments 
received for the plan, less the amounts credited to the contingency and 
administrative reserves and amounts for other obligations due under the 
contract, will be made available for carrier drawdown not later than 30 
days after receipt by the FEHB Fund.
    (2) Withdrawals from the LOC account will be made on a checks-
presented basis. Under a checks-presented basis, drawdown on the LOC is 
delayed until the checks issued for FEHB Program disbursements are 
presented to the carrier's bank for payment.
    (3) OPM may grant a waiver of the restriction of LOC disbursements 
to a checks-presented basis if the carrier requests the waiver in 
writing and demonstrates to OPM's satisfaction that the checks-presented 
basis of LOC disbursements will result in significantly increased 
liability under the contract, or that the checks-presented basis of LOC 
disbursements is otherwise clearly and significantly detrimental to the 
operation of the plan. Payments to carriers that have been granted a 
waiver may be made by an alternative payment methodology, subject to OPM 
approval.

payment from the contingency reserve that is in addition to those 
amounts, if any, paid under 5 CFR 890.503(c)(1) through (c)(4), if the 
carrier can show good cause, such as, unexpected adverse claims 
experience. OPM will decide whether to allow the request in whole or in

from other sources makes it difficult to precisely determine FEHBP cash 
balances at any given time or to precisely determine investment income 
attributable to FEHBP invested assets.
    (c) FEHBP funds shall be maintained separately from other cash and 
investments of the carrier or underwriter. Cash and investment balances 
reported on FEHBP Annual Accounting Statements must agree with the 
carrier's books and records.
    (d) This requirement may be waived by the contracting officer in 
accordance with the clause at 1652.232-72 when adequate accounting and 
other controls are in effect. If the requirement is waived, the waiver 
will remain in effect until it is withdrawn by OPM. The waiver shall be 
withdrawn if OPM determines that the accounting controls are no longer 
adequate to properly account for FEHBP funds.

Number ------ with the Transferor. The term contracts, as used in this 
Agreement, means the contract cited in this paragraph and all other 
contracts and purchase orders, including any and all amendments and 
modifications made between the Government and the Transferor before the 
effective date of this Agreement (whether or not performance and payment 
have been completed and releases executed if the Government or the 
Transferor has any remaining rights, duties, or obligations under these 
contracts and purchase orders).
    (2) As of -------------------------- 19---- (insert date transfer of 
assets became effective under applicable State law), the Transferor has 
transferred to the Transferee all the assets of the Transferor, or the 
entire portion of the Transferor's assets pertinent to performing the 
contract, as determined by OPM, by virtue of a(an) (insert term 
describing the legal transaction involved) between the Transferor and

    (3) The Transferee has acquired all the assets of the Transferor, or

the contract, as determined by OPM, by virtue of the transfer in 
paragraph (a)(1).
    (4) The Transferee has assumed all obligations and liabilities of 
the Transferor pertinent to performing the contract, as determined by 
OPM, by virtue of the transfer in paragraph (a)(1).
    (5) The Transferee is in a position to fully perform all obligations 
that may exist under the contract.
    (6) It is consistent with the Government's interest to recognize the 
Transferee as the successor party to the contract.
    (7) Evidence of the transfer in paragraph (a)(1) has been filed with 
the Government.
    (8) [If applicable:] A certificate dated ------------------------, 
19----, signed by the Secretary of State of (insert State), to the 
effect that the corporate name of (insert old corporate name) was 
changed to (insert new corporate name) on ----------------------, 19----

    (b) IN CONSIDERATION OF THESE FACTS, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT BY THIS 
AGREEMENT--
    (1) The Transferor confirms the transfer to the Transferee, and 
waives any claims and rights against the Government or the Federal 
Employees Health Benefits Fund that it now has or may have in the future 
in connection with the contract.

[[Page 142]]

    (2) The Transferee agrees to be bound by and to perform the contract 
in accordance with the conditions contained in the contract. The 
Transferee also assumes all obligations and liabilities of, and all 
claims against, the Transferor pertinent to the contract, as determined 
by OPM, as if the Transferee were the original party to the contract.
    (3) The Transferee ratifies all previous actions taken by the 
Transferor with respect to the contract, with the same force and effect 
as if the action had been taken by the Transferee.
    (4) The Government recognizes the Transferee as the Transferor's 
successor in interest in and to the contract. The Transferee by this 
Agreement becomes entitled to all rights, titles, and interests of the 
Transferor in and to the contract as if the Transferee were the original 
party to the contract. Following the effective date of this Agreement, 
the terms Carrier and Contractor as used in the contract, shall refer to 
the Transferee.
    (5) Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, nothing in it 
shall be construed as a waiver of any rights of the Government against 
the Transferor.
    (6) All payments and reimbursements previously made by the 
Government to the Transferor, and all other previous actions taken by 
the Government under the contract, shall be considered to have 
discharged those parts of the Government's obligations under the 
contract. All payments and reimbursements made by the Government after 
the date of this Agreement in the name of or to the Transferor shall 
have the same force and effect as if made to the Transferee, and shall 
constitute a complete discharge of the Government's obligations under 
the contract, to the extent of the amounts paid or reimbursed.
    (7) The Transferor and the Transferee agree that the Government is 
not obligated to pay or reimburse either of them for, or otherwise give 
effect to, any costs, taxes, or other expenses, or any related 
increases, directly or indirectly arising out of or resulting from the 
transfer of this Agreement, other than those that the Government in the 
absence of this transfer or Agreement would have been obligated to pay 
or reimburse under the terms of the contract.
    (8) The Transferor guarantees payment of all liabilities and the 
performance of all obligations that the Transferee (i) assumes under 
this Agreement or (ii) may undertake in the future should this contract 
be modified under its terms and conditions. The Transferor waives notice 
of, and consents to, any such future modifications.
    (9) The contract shall remain in full force and effect, except as 
modified by this Agreement. Each party has executed this Agreement 
effective (insert the date transfer of assets became effective under 
applicable State law).

  Subpart 1642.70_Management Agreement (in Lieu of Novation Agreement)


<R05>
Sec. 1642.7001  Management agreement.

    When it is in the best interest of FEHBP enrollees to continue a 
contract for an interim period after the carrier discontinues its 
operations and has entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (or other 
descriptive term), but before a successor in interest has been 
recognized by OPM, the carrier may submit for OPM approval a Management 
Agreement that enables it to continue a contract through an agreement 
with a third party to administer the day-to-day performance of the 
contract. Examples of situations in which a Management Agreement may be 
accepted by OPM are:
    (a) When a transfer of assets does not meet the criteria for a 
novation;
    (b) While a request for a novation is pending;
    (c) While awaiting a decision on a request for a novation;
    (d) As an interim measure, when the timing of a transfer of assets 
or the

[[Page 144]]

timing of a carrier's withdrawal make administration of the contract 
inconvenient;
    (e) When it is not in the interests of the Government to either 
recognize a successor in interest or to immediately terminate the 
existing FEHBP contract.

<R05>
Sec. 1644.170  Policy for FEHB Program subcontracting.

    (a) General policy. Carriers must follow commercially reasonable 
procurement procedures that comply, when required, with the Federal 
Acquisition Regulations (FAR) policies and procedures relating to 
competition and contract pricing for the acquisition of both commercial 
and noncommercial items.
    (b) Consent. For all experience-rated contracts, carriers will 
notify the Contracting officer in writing at least 30 days in advance of 
entering into any subcontract or subcontract modification, or as 
otherwise specified by the contract, if: the amount of the subcontract 
or the amount of the subcontract and modification charged to the FEHB 
Program equals or exceeds $550,000 and is at least 25 percent of the 
total subcontract's costs. The amount of the dollar charge to the FEHB 
Program shall be adjusted by the same amount and at the same time as any 
change to the threshold for application of the Truth in Negotiations Act 
pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 254b(a)(7). Failure to provide advance notice may 
result in a Contracting officer's disallowance of subcontract costs or a 
penalty when considering the performance aspect of the carriers' service 
charge.
    (1) All subcontracts or subcontract modifications that equal or 
exceed the threshold are subject to audit under FAR 52.215-2 ``Audit and 
Records-Negotiations'' if based on cost analysis, and subject to the 
provisions of 48 CFR 1646.301 and 1652.246-70 ``FEHB Inspection'' if 
based on price analysis.
    (2) In determining whether the amount chargeable to the FEHB Program 
contract for a given subcontract or modification equals or exceeds the 
$550,000 threshold, the following rules apply:
    (i) For initial advance notification, the carrier shall provide the 
total cost/price for the base year.
    (ii) The carrier shall provide advance notification of any 
modifications, options, including quantity or service options and option 
periods, and renewals of ``evergreen contracts'' that cause the total 
price to equal or exceed the threshold. OPM's review will be of the 
modification(s), itself, but documentation for the original subcontract 
will be required to perform the review.
    (iii) The $550,000 threshold will be adjusted by the same amount and 
at the same time as any change to the threshold for application of the 
Truth in Negotiations Act.

              Subpart 1646.2_Contract Quality Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 1646.201  Contract Quality Policy.

    (a) This section prescribes general policies and procedures to 
ensure that services acquired under the FEHB contract conform to the 
contract's quality and audit requirements.
    (b) OPM will periodically evaluate the contractor's system of 
internal controls under the quality assurance program required by the 
contract and will acknowledge in writing whether or not the system is 
consistent with the requirements set forth in the contract. After the 
initial review, subsequent reviews may be limited to changes in the 
contractor's internal control guidelines. However, a limited review does 
not diminish the contractor's obligation to apply the full internal 
control system.
    (c) OPM will issue specific quality performance standards for the 
FEHB contracts and will inform carriers of the applicable standards 
prior to negotiations for the contract year. OPM will benchmark its 
standards against standards generally accepted in the insurance 
industry. The contracting officer may authorize nationally recognized 
standards to be used to fulfill this requirement. FEHB carriers will 
comply with the performance standards issued by OPM.
    (d) In addition to reviewing carriers' quality assurance programs, 
OPM will periodically audit contractors, subcontractors and Large 
Providers' books and records to assure compliance with FEHB law, 
regulations, and the contract.

its underwriter, if any, and other subcontractors directly involved in 
the preparation or distribution of such advertising material and shall 
substitute ``Contractor'' or other appropriate reference for the term 
``Carrier.''

<R05>
Sec. 1652.204-72  Filing health benefit claims/court review of disputed 
          claims.

    As prescribed in 1604.7101 of this chapter, the following clause 
must be inserted in all FEHB Program contracts.

 Filing Health Benefit Claims/Court Review of Disputed Claims (MAR 1995)

    (a) General. (1) The Carrier resolves claims filed under the Plan. 
All health benefit claims must be submitted initially to the Carrier. If 
the Carrier denies a claim (or a portion of a claim), the covered 
individual may ask the Carrier to reconsider its denial. If the Carrier 
affirms its denial or fails to respond as required by paragraph (b) of 
this clause, the covered individual may ask OPM to review the claim. A 
covered individual must exhaust both the Carrier and OPM review 
processes specified in this clause before seeking judicial review of the 
denied claim.
    (2) This clause applies to covered individuals and to other 
individuals or entities who are acting on the behalf of a covered 
individual and who have the covered individual's specific written 
consent to pursue payment of the disputed claim.
    (b) Time limits for reconsidering a claim. (1) The covered 
individual has 6 months from the date of the notice to the covered 
individual that a claim (or a portion of a claim) was denied by the 
Carrier in which to submit a written request for reconsideration to the 
Carrier. The time limit for requesting reconsideration may be extended 
when the covered individual shows that he or she was prevented by 
circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within 
the time limit.
    (2) The Carrier has 30 days after the date of receipt of a timely-
filed request for reconsideration to:
    (i) Affirm the denial in writing to the covered individual;
    (ii) Pay the bill or provide the service; or
    (iii) Request from the covered individual or provider additional 
information needed to make a decision on the claim. The Carrier must 
simultaneously notify the covered individual of the information 
requested if it requests additional information from a provider. The 
Carrier has 30 days after the date the information is received to affirm 
the denial in writing to the covered individual or pay the bill or 
provide the service. The Carrier must make its decision based on the 
evidence it has if the covered individual or provider does not respond 
within 60 days after the date of the Carrier's notice requesting 
additional information. The Carrier must then send written notice to the 
covered individual of its decision on the claim. The covered individual 
may request OPM review as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this clause if 
the Carrier fails to act within the time limit set forth in this 
paragraph.
    (3) The covered individual may write to OPM and request that OPM 
review the Carrier's decision if the Carrier either affirms its denial 
of a claim or fails to respond to a covered individual's written request 
for reconsideration within the time limit set forth in paragraph (b)(2) 
of this clause. The covered individual must submit the request for OPM 
review within the time limit specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this 
clause.
    (4) The Carrier may extend the time limit for a covered individual's 
submission of additional information to the Carrier when the covered 
individual shows he or she was not notified of the time limit or was 
prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from submitting the 
additional information.
    (c) Information required to process requests for reconsideration. 
(1) The covered individual

[[Page 150]]

must put the request to the Carrier to reconsider a claim in writing and 
give the reasons, in terms of applicable brochure provisions, that the 
denied claim should have been approved.
    (2) If the Carrier needs additional information from the covered 
individual to make a decision, it must:
    (i) Specifically identify the information needed;
    (ii) State the reason the information is required to make a decision 
on the claim;
    (iii) Specify the time limit (60 days after the date of the 
Carrier's request) for submitting the information; and
    (iv) State the consequences of failure to respond within the time 
limit specified, as set out in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (d) Carrier determinations. The Carrier must provide written notice 
to the covered individual of its determination. If the Carrier affirms 
the initial denial, the notice must inform the covered individual of:
    (1) The specific and detailed reasons for the denial;
    (2) The covered individual's right to request a review by OPM; and
    (3) The requirement that requests for OPM review must be received 
within 90 days after the date of the Carrier's denial notice and include 
a copy of the denial notice as well as documents to support the covered 
individual's position.
    (e) OPM review. (1) If the covered individual seeks further review 
of the denied claim, the covered individual must make a request to OPM 
to review the Carrier's decision. Such a request to OPM must be made:
    (i) Within 90 days after the date of the Carrier's notice to the 
covered individual that the denial was affirmed; or
    (ii) If the Carrier fails to respond to the covered individual as 
provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, within 120 days after the 
date of the covered individual's timely request for reconsideration by 
the Carrier; or
    (iii) Within 120 days after the date the Carrier requests additional 
information from the covered individual, or the date the covered 
individual is notified that the Carrier is requesting additional 
information from a provider. OPM may extend the time limit for a covered 
individual's request for OPM review when the covered individual shows he 
or she was not notified of the time limit or was prevented by 
circumstances beyond his or her control from submitting the request for 
OPM review within the time limit.
    (2) In reviewing a claim denied by the Carrier, OPM may:
    (i) Request that the covered individual submit additional 
information;
    (ii) Obtain an advisory opinion from an independent physician;
    (iii) Obtain any other information as may in its judgment be 
required to make a determination; or
    (iv) Make its decision based solely on the information the covered 
individual provided with his or her request for review.
    (3) When OPM requests information from the Carrier, the Carrier must 
release the information within 30 days after the date of OPM's written 
request unless a different time limit is specified by OPM in its 
request.
    (4) Within 90 days after receipt of the request for review, OPM will 
either:
    (i) Give a written notice of its decision to the covered individual 
and the Carrier; or
    (ii) Notify the individual of the status of the review. If OPM does 
not receive requested evidence within 15 days after expiration of the 
applicable time limit in paragraph (e)(3) of this clause, OPM may make 
its decision based solely on information available to it at that time 
and give a written notice of its decision to the covered individual and 
to the Carrier.
    (f) OPM, upon its own motion, may reopen its review if it receives 
evidence that was unavailable at the time of its original decision.
    (g) Court review. (1) A suit to compel enrollment under Sec.  
890.102 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, must be brought against 
the employing office that made the enrollment decision.
    (2) A suit to review the legality of OPM's regulations under this 
part must be brought against the Office of Personnel Management.
    (3) Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) carriers resolve FEHB 
claims under authority of Federal statute (chapter 89, title 5, United 
States Code). A covered individual may seek judicial review of OPM's 
final action on the denial of a health benefits claim. A legal action to 
review final action by OPM involving such denial of health benefits must 
be brought against OPM and not against the Carrier or the Carrier's 
subcontractors. The recovery in such a suit shall be limited to a court 
order directing OPM to require the Carrier to pay the amount of benefits 
in dispute.
    (4) An action under paragraph (3) of this clause to recover on a 
claim for health benefits:
    (i) May not be brought prior to exhaustion of the administrative 
remedies provided in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this clause;
    (ii) May not be brought later than December 31 of the 3rd year after 
the year in which the care or service was provided; and
    (iii) Will be limited to the record that was before OPM when it 
rendered its decision affirming the Carrier's denial of benefits.

Sec. 1652.204-74  Large provider agreements.

    As prescribed by 1604.7202, the contracting officer will insert the 
following clause in all FEHB Program contracts based on cost analysis 
(experience-rated):

                  Large Provider Agreements (OCT 2005)

    (a) Notification and Information Requirements. (1) The experience-
rated Carrier must provide notice to the contracting officer of its 
intent to enter into or to make a significant modification of a Large 
Provider Agreement:
    (i) Not less than 60 days before entering into any Large Provider 
Agreement; and
    (ii) Not less than 60 days before exercising a renewal or other 
option, or significant modification to a Large Provider Agreement, when 
such action would result in total costs to the FEHB Program of an 
additional 20 percent or more above the existing contract. However, if a 
carrier is exercising a simple renewal or other option contemplated by a 
Large Provider Agreement that OPM previously reviewed, and there are no 
significant changes, then a statement to the effect that the renewal or 
other option is being exercised along with the dollar amount is 
sufficient notice.
    (2) The carrier's notification to the contracting officer must be in 
writing and must, at a minimum:
    (i) Describe the supplies and/or services the proposed provider 
agreement will require;
    (ii) Identify the proposed basis for reimbursement;
    (iii) Identify the proposed provider agreement, explain why the 
carrier selected the proposed provider, and what contracting method it 
used, where applicable, including the kind of competition obtained;
    (iv) Describe the methodology the carrier used to compute the 
provider's profit; and,
    (v) Describe provider risk provisions.
    (3) The Contracting officer may request from the carrier any 
additional information on a proposed provider agreement and its terms 
and conditions prior to a provider award and during the performance of 
the agreement.
    (4) Within 30 days of receiving the carrier's notification, the 
Contracting officer will give the carrier either written comments or 
written notice that there will be no comments. If the Contracting 
officer comments, the carrier must respond in writing within 10 calendar 
days, and explain how it intends to address any concerns.
    (5) When computing the carrier's service charge, the Contracting 
officer will consider how well the carrier complies with the provisions 
of this section, including the advance notification requirements, as an 
aspect of the carrier's performance factor.
    (6) The Contracting officer's review of any Large Provider 
Agreement, option, renewal, or modification will not constitute a 
determination of the acceptability of the terms and conditions of any 
provider agreement or

[[Page 152]]

of the allowability of any costs under the carrier's contract, nor will 
it relieve the carrier of any responsibility for performing the 
contract.
    (b) Records and Inspection. The carrier must insert in all Large 
Provider Agreements the requirement that the provider will retain and 
make available to the Government all records relating to the agreement 
that support the annual statement of operations and enrollee records--
Retain for 6 years after the agreement term ends.
    (c) Audit and Records--Negotiation. The provisions of FAR 52.215-2, 
``Audit and Records--Negotiation,'' when required, or FEHBAR 1652.246-
70, ``FEHB Inspection'' apply to all experience-rated Carriers' Large 
Provider Agreements. The Carrier will insert the clauses at FAR 52.215-
2, when applicable, or FEHBAR 1652.246-70 in all Large Provider 
Agreements. In FAR 52.215-2 the carrier will substitute:
    (1) The term ``Large Provider'' for the term ``Contractor'' 
throughout the clause, and
    (2) The term ``Large Provider Agreement'' for the term 
``Subcontracts'' in paragraph (g) of FAR 52.215-2. The term 
``Contracting officer'' will mean the FEHB Program Contracting officer 
at OPM. The carrier will be responsible for ensuring the Large Provider 
complies with the provisions set forth in the clause.
    (d) Prohibited Agreements. No provider agreement made under this 
contract will provide for payment on a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost 
basis.
    (e) The carrier will insert this clause, 1652.204-74, in all Large 
Provider Agreements.

Sec. 1652.215-70  Rate Reduction for Defective Pricing or Defective Cost 
          or Pricing Data.

    As prescribed in 1615.407-1, the following clause shall be inserted 
in FEHBP contracts exceeding the threshold at FAR 15.403-4(a)(1) that 
are based on a combination of cost and price analysis (community rated):

 Rate Reduction for Defective Pricing or Defective Cost or Pricing Data 
                               (JAN 2004)

    (a) If any rate established in connection with this contract was 
increased because (1) the Carrier submitted, or kept in its files in 
support of the FEHBP rate, cost or pricing data that were not complete, 
accurate, or current as certified in the Certificate of Accurate Cost or 
Pricing Data (FEHBAR 1615.406-2); (2) the Carrier submitted, or kept in 
its files in support of the FEHBP rate, cost or pricing data that were 
not accurate as represented in the rate proposal documents; (3) the 
Carrier developed FEHBP rates with a rating methodology and structure 
inconsistent with that used to develop rates for similarly sized 
subscriber groups (see FEHBAR 1602.170-13) as certified in the 
Certificate of Accurate Cost or Pricing Data for Community Rated 
Carriers; or (4) the Carrier submitted or, or kept in its files in 
support of the FEHBP rate, data or information of any description that 
were not complete, accurate, and current--then, the rate shall be 
reduced in the amount by which the price was increased because of the 
defective data or information.
    (b)(1) If the Contracting Officer determines under paragraph (a) of 
this clause that a price or cost reduction should be made, the Carrier 
agrees not to raise the following matters as a defense:
    (i) The Carrier was a sole source supplier or otherwise was in a 
superior bargaining position and thus the price of the contract would 
not have been modified even if accurate, complete, and current cost or 
pricing data had been submitted or maintained and identified.
    (ii) The Contracting Officer should have known that the cost or 
pricing data in issue were defective even though the Carrier took no 
affirmative action to bring the character of the data to the attention 
of the Contracting Officer.
    (iii) The contract was based on an agreement about the total cost of 
the contract and there was no agreement about the cost of each item 
procured under the contract.
    (iv) The Carrier did not submit or keep in its files a Certificate 
of Current Cost or Pricing Data.
    (2)(i) Except as prohibited by subdivision (b)(2)(ii) of this 
clause, an offset in an amount determined appropriate by the Contracting 
Officer based upon the facts shall be allowed against the amount of a 
contract price reduction if--
    (A) The Carrier certifies to the Contracting Officer that, to the 
best of the Carrier's knowledge and belief, the Carrier is entitled to 
the offset in the amount requested; and
    (B) The Carrier proves that the cost or pricing data were available 
before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of 
the modification) and that the data were not submitted before such date.
    (ii) An offset shall not be allowed if--
    (A) The understated data was known by the Carrier to be understated 
when the Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data was signed; or
    (B) The Government proves that the facts demonstrate that the 
contract price would not have increased in the amount to be offset

[[Page 153]]

even if the available data had been submitted before the date of 
agreement on price.
    (c) When the Contracting Officer determines that the rates shall be 
reduced and the Government is thereby entitled to a refund, the Carrier 
shall be liable to and shall pay the FEHB Fund at the time the 
overpayment is repaid--
    (1) Simple interest on the amount of the overpayment from the date 
the overpayment was paid from the FEHB Fund to the Carrier until the 
date the overcharge is liquidated. In calculating the amount of interest 
due, the quarterly rate determinations by the Secretary of the Treasury 
under the authority of 26 U.S.C. 6621(a)(2) applicable to the periods 
the overcharge was retained by the Carrier shall be used; and,
    (2) A penalty equal to the amount of overpayment, if the Carrier 
knowingly submitted cost or pricing data which was incomplete, 
inaccurate, or noncurrent.

                      Investment Income (JAN 1998)

    (a) The Carrier shall invest and reinvest all FEHB funds on hand 
that are in excess of the funds needed to promptly discharge the 
obligations incurred under this contract. The Carrier shall seek to 
maximize investment income with prudent consideration to the safety and 
liquidity of investments.
    (b) All investment income earned on FEHB funds shall be credited to 
the Special Reserve on behalf of the FEHBP.
    (c) When the Contracting Officer concludes that the Carrier failed 
to comply with paragraph (a) or (b) of this clause, the Carrier shall 
credit the Special Reserve with investment income that would have been 
earned, at the rate(s) specified in paragraph (f) of this clause, had it 
not been for the Carrier's noncompliance. ``Failed to comply with 
paragraph (a) or (b)'' means: (1) Making any charges against the 
contract which are not allowable, allocable, or reasonable; or (2) 
failing to credit any income due the contract and/or failing to place 
excess funds, including subscription income and payments from OPM not 
needed to discharge promptly the obligations incurred under the 
contract, refunds, credits, payments, deposits, investment income 
earned, uncashed checks, or other amounts owed the Special Reserve, in 
income producing investments and accounts.
    (d) Investment income lost as a result of unallowable, unallocable, 
or unreasonable charges against the contract shall be paid from the 1st 
day of the contract term following the contract term in which the 
unallowable charge was made and shall end on the earlier of: (1) The 
date the amounts are returned to the Special Reserve (or the Office of 
Personnel Management); (2) the date specified by the Contracting 
Officer; or, (3) the date of the Contracting Officer's Final Decision.
    (e) Investment income lost as a result of failure to credit income 
due the contract or failure to place excess funds in income producing 
investments and accounts shall be paid from the date the funds should 
have been invested or appropriate income was not credited and shall end 
on the earlier of: (1) The date the amounts are returned to the Special 
Reserve (or the Office of Personnel Management); (2) the date specified 
by the Contracting Officer; or, (3) the date of the Contracting 
Officer's Final Decision.
    (f) The Carrier shall credit the Special Reserve for income due in 
accordance with this clause. All lost investment income payable shall 
bear simple interest at the quarterly rate determined by the Secretary 
of the Treasury under the authority of 26 U.S.C. 6621(a)(2) applicable 
to the periods in which the amount becomes due, as provided in 
paragraphs (d) and (e) of this clause.
    (g) The Carrier shall incorporate this clause into agreements with 
underwriters of the Carrier's FEHB plan and shall substitute 
``underwriter'' or other appropriate reference for the term ``Carrier.''

Sec. 1652.216-70  Accounting and price adjustment.

    As prescribed in section 1616.7001, the following clause shall be 
inserted in all FEHBP contracts based on a combination of cost and price 
analysis (community rated).

               Accounting and Price Adjustment (JAN 2003)

    (a) Annual Accounting Statement. The Carrier, not later than 90 days 
after the end of each contract period, shall furnish to OPM for that 
contract period an accounting of its operations under the contract. The 
accounting shall be in the form prescribed by OPM.
    (b) Adjustment. (1) This contract is community rated as defined in 
FEHBAR 1602.170-2.

[[Page 154]]

    (2) The subscription rates agreed to in this contract shall be 
equivalent to the subscription rates given to the carrier's similarly 
sized subscriber groups (SSSGs) as defined in FEHBAR 1602.170-13.
    (3) If, at the time of the rate reconciliation, the subscription 
rates are found to be lower than the equivalent rates for the lower of 
the two SSSGs, the carrier may include an adjustment to the Federal 
group's rates for the next contract period.
    (4) If, at the time of the rate reconciliation, the subscription 
rates are found to be higher than the equivalent rates for the lower of 
the two SSSGs, the Carrier shall reimburse the Fund, for example, by 
reducing the FEHB rates for the next contract term to reflect the 
difference between the estimated rates and the rates which are derived 
using the methodology of the lower rated SSSG.
    (5) No upward adjustment in the rate established for this contract 
will be allowed or considered by the Government or will be made by the 
Carrier in this or in any other contract period on the basis of actual 
costs incurred, actual benefits provided, or actual size or composition 
of the FEHBP group during this contract period.
    (6) In the event this contract is not renewed, neither the 
Government nor the Carrier shall be entitled to any adjustment or claim 
for the difference between the subscription rates prior to rate 
reconciliation and the actual subscription rates.

<R05>
Sec. 1652.216-71  Accounting and Allowable Cost.

    As prescribed in section 1616.7002, the following clause shall be 
inserted in all FEHBP contracts based on cost analysis (experience 
rated).

      Accounting and Allowable Cost (FEHBAR 1652.216-71) (JAN 2003)

    (a) Annual Accounting Statements. (1) The Carrier shall furnish to 
OPM an accounting of its operations under the contract. In preparing the 
accounting, the Carrier shall follow the reporting requirements and 
statement formats prescribed by OPM in the OPM Annual and Fiscal Year 
Financial Reporting Instructions.
    (2) The Carrier shall have its Annual Accounting Statements and that 
of its underwriter, if any, audited in accordance with the FEHBP 
Experienced-Rated Carrier and Service Organization Audit Guide (Guide). 
The Carrier shall submit the audit report and the Annual Accounting 
Statements to OPM in accordance with the requirements of the Guide.
    (3) Based on the results of either the independent audit prescribed 
by the Guide or a Government audit, OPM may require the Carrier adjust 
its annual accounting statements (i) by amounts found not to constitute 
actual, allowable, allocable and reasonable costs; or (ii) to reflect 
prior overpayments or underpayments.
    (4) The Carrier shall develop corrective action plans to resolve 
audit findings identified in audits that were performed in accordance 
with the Guide. The corrective action plans will be prepared in 
accordance with and as defined by the Guide.
    (b) Definition of costs. (1) The Carrier may charge a cost to the 
contract for a contract term if the cost is actual, allowable, 
allocable, and reasonable. In addition, the Carrier must:
    (i) on request, document and make available accounting support for 
the cost to justify that the cost is actual, reasonable and necessary; 
and
    (ii) determine the cost in accordance with: (A) the terms of this 
contract, and (B) Subpart 31.2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation 
(FAR) and Subpart 1631.2 of the Federal Employees Health Benefits 
Program Acquisition Regulation (FEHBAR) applicable on the first day of 
the contract period.
    (2) In the absence of specific contract terms to the contrary, the 
Carrier shall classify contract costs in accordance with the following 
criteria:
    (i) Benefits. Benefit costs consist of payments made and liabilities 
incurred for covered health care services on behalf of FEHBP subscribers 
less any refunds, rebates, allowances or other credits received.
    (ii) Administrative expenses. Administrative expenses consist of all 
actual, allowable, allocable and reasonable expenses incurred in the 
adjudication of subscriber benefit claims or incurred in the Carrier's 
overall operation of the business. Unless otherwise stated in the 
contract, administrative expenses include, in part: all taxes (excluding 
premium taxes, as provided in section 1631.205-41), insurance and 
reinsurance premiums, medical and dental consultants used in the 
adjudication process, concurrent or managed care review when not billed 
by a health care provider and other forms of utilization review, the 
cost of maintaining eligibility files, legal expenses incurred in the 
litigation of benefit payments and bank charges for letters of credit. 
Administrative expenses exclude the cost of Carrier personnel, 
equipment, and facilities directly used in the delivery of health care 
services, which are benefit costs, and the expense of managing the FEHBP 
investment program which is a reduction of investment income earned.
    (iii) Investment income. While compliance with the checks presented 
letter of credit

[[Page 155]]

methodology will minimize funds on hand, the Carrier shall invest and 
reinvest all funds on hand, including any in the Special Reserve or any 
attributable to the reserve for incurred but unpaid claims, which are in 
excess of the funds needed to discharge promptly the obligations 
incurred under the contract. Investment income represents the net amount 
earned by the Carrier after deducting investment expenses. Investment 
expenses are those actual, allowable, allocable, and reasonable contract 
costs that are attributable to the investment of funds, such as 
consultant or management fees.
    (iv) Other charges. (A) Mandatory statutory reserve. Charges for 
mandatory statutory reserves are not allowable unless specifically 
provided for in the contract. When the term ``mandatory statutory 
reserve'' is specifically identified as an allowable contract charge 
without further definition or explanation, it means a requirement 
imposed by State law upon the Carrier to set aside a specific amount or 
rate of funds into a restricted reserve that is accounted for separately 
from all other reserves and surpluses of the Carrier and which may be 
used only with the specific approval of the State official designated by 
law to make such approvals. The amount chargeable to the contract may 
not exceed an allocable portion of the amount actually set aside. If the 
statutory reserve is no longer required for the purpose for which it was 
created, and these funds become available for the general use of the 
Carrier, the Carrier shall return to the FEHBP a pro rata share based 
upon FEHBP's contribution to the total Carrier's set aside shall be 
returned to the FEHBP in accordance with FAR 31.201-5.
    (B) Premium taxes. (1) When the term ``premium taxes'' is used in 
this contract without further definition or explanation, it means a tax, 
fee, or other monetary payment directly or indirectly imposed on FEHB 
premiums by any State, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico or by any political subdivision or other governmental 
authority of those entities, with the sole exception of a tax on net 
income or profit, if that tax, fee, or payment is applicable to a broad 
range of business activity.
    (2) For purposes of this paragraph (B), OPM has determined that the 
term ``State'' as used in 5 U.S.C. 8909(f) includes, but is not limited 
to, a territory or possession of the United States.
    (c) Certification of Accounting Statement Accuracy. (1) The Carrier 
shall certify the annual and fiscal year accounting statements in the 
form set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this clause. The Carrier's chief 
executive officer and the chief financial officer shall sign the 
certificate.
    (2) The Carrier shall require an authorized agent of its 
underwriter, if any, also to certify the annual accounting statement.
    (3) The certificate required shall be in the following form:

             Certification of Accounting Statement Accuracy

    This is to certify that I have reviewed this accounting statement 
and to the best of my knowledge and belief:
    1. The statement was prepared in conformity with the guidelines 
issued by the Office of Personnel Management and fairly presents the 
financial results of this reporting period in conformity with those 
guidelines.
    2. The costs included in the statement are actual, allowable, 
allocable, and reasonable in accordance with the terms of the contract 
and with the cost principles of the Federal Employees Health Benefits 
Acquisition Regulation and the Federal Acquisition Regulation;
    3. Income, rebates, allowances, refunds and other credits made or 
owed in accordance with the terms of the contract and applicable cost 
principles have been included in the statement;
    4. If applicable, the letter of credit account was managed in 
accordance with 5 CFR part 890, 48 CFR chapter 16, and OPM guidelines.

upon the Carrier's ability to meet its obligations under this contract, 
including, but not limited to, any of the following:
    (1) Disposal of major assets;
    (2) Loss of 15% or more of the Carrier's overall membership;
    (3) Termination or modification of any contract or subcontract if 
such termination or modification might have a material effect on the 
Carrier's obligations under this contract;
    (4) Addition or termination of provider agreements;
    (5) Any changes in underwriters, reinsurers, or participating plans;
    (6) The imposition of, or notice of the intent to impose, a

law;
    (8) Default on a loan or other financial obligation;
    (9) Any actual or potential labor dispute that delays or threatens 
to delay timely performance or substantially impairs the functioning of 
the Carrier's facilities or facilities used by the Carrier in the 
performance of the contract;
    (10) Any change in its charter, constitution, or by-laws which 
affects any provision of this contract or the Carrier's participation in 
the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program; or
    (11) Any significant changes in policies and procedures or 
interpretations of the contract or brochure which would affect the 
benefits available under the contract or the costs charged to the 
contract.
    (12) Any fraud, embezzlement or misappropriation of FEHB funds; or
    (13) Any written exceptions, reservations or qualifications 
expressed by the independent accounting firm (which ascribes to the 
standards of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants) 
contracted with by the Carrier to provide an opinion on its annual 
financial statements.
    (b) Upon learning of a Significant Event OPM may institute action, 
in proportion to the seriousness of the event, to protect the interest 
of Members, including, but not limited to--
    (1) Directing the Carrier to take corrective action;
    (2) Suspending new enrollments under this contract;
    (3) Advising Enrollees of the Significant Event and providing them 
an opportunity to transfer to another plan;
    (4) Withholding payment of subscription income or restricting access 
to the Carrier's Letter of Credit account.
    (5) Terminating the enrollment of those enrollees who, in the 
judgment of OPM, would be adversely affected by the Significant Event; 
or
    (6) Terminating this contract pursuant to section 1.15, renewal and 
withdrawal of approval.
    (c) Prior to taking action as described in paragraph (b) of this 
clause, the OPM will notify the Carrier and offer an opportunity to 
respond.
    (d) The carrier will insert this clause in any subcontract or 
subcontract modification if the amount of the subcontract or 
modification charged to the FEHB Program (or in the case of a community-
rated carrier, applicable to the FEHB Program) equals or exceeds 
$550,000 and is at least 25 percent of the total subcontract cost. The 
amount of the dollar charge to the FEHB Program shall be adjusted by the 
same amount and at the same time as any change to the threshold for 
application of the Truth in Negotiations Act pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 
254b(a)(7).

annuitants that is provided by agencies and OPM, including social 
security numbers, for only those routine uses stipulated for the data 
and published annually in the Federal Register as a part of OPM's notice 
of systems of records.
    (b) The Carrier shall also hold all medical records, and information 
relating thereto, of Federal subscribers and family members confidential 
except as follows:
    (1) As may be reasonably necessary for the administration of this 
contract;
    (2) As authorized by the patient or his or her guardian;

    (5) As necessary to carry out the coordination of benefits 
provisions of this contract; and
    (6) For bona fide medical research or educational purposes. Release 
of information for medical research or educational purposes shall be 
limited to aggregated information of a statistical nature that does not 
identify any individual by name, social security number, or any other 
identifier unique to an individual.
    (c) If the carrier uses medical records for the administration of 
the contract, or for bona fide medical research or educational purposes, 
it shall so state in the plan's brochure.

    As prescribed in section 1629.402, the following clause shall be 
inserted in all FEHBP contracts performed outside the United States, its 
possessions, and Puerto Rico:

         Taxes--Foreign Negotiated Benefits Contracts (JAN 1998)

    (a) To the extent that this contract provides for performing 
services outside the United States, its possessions, and Puerto Rico, 
this clause applies in lieu of any Federal, State, and local taxes 
clause of the contract.
    (b) ``Contract date,'' as used in this clause, means the effective 
date of this contract or modification.
    ``Country concerned,'' as used in this clause, means any country, 
other than the United States, its possessions, and Puerto Rico, in which 
expenditures under this contract are made.
    ``Tax'' and ``taxes,'' as used in this clause, include fees and 
charges for doing business that are levied by the government of the 
country concerned or by its political subdivisions.
    ``All applicable taxes and duties,'' as used in this clause, means 
all taxes and duties, in effect on the contract date, that the taxing 
authority is imposing and collecting on the transactions covered by this 
contract, pursuant to written ruling or regulation in effect on the 
contract date.
    ``After-imposed tax,'' as used in this clause, means any new or 
increased tax or duty, or tax that was exempted or excluded on the 
contract date but whose exemption was later revoked or reduced during 
the contract period, other than excepted tax, on the transactions 
covered by this contract that the Carrier is required to pay or bear as 
the result of legislative, judicial, or administrative action taking 
effect after the contract date.
    ``After-relieved tax,'' as used in this clause, means any amount of 
tax or duty, other than an excepted tax, that would otherwise have been 
payable on the transactions covered by this contract, but which the 
Carrier is not required to pay or bear, or for which the Carrier obtains 
a refund, as the result of legislative, judicial, or administrative 
action taking effect after the contract date.
    ``Excepted tax,'' as used in this clause, means social security or 
other employment taxes, net income and franchise taxes, excess profits 
taxes, capital stock taxes, transportation taxes, unemployment 
compensation taxes, and property taxes. ``Excepted tax'' does not

from sales covered by this contract, or any tax assessed on the 
Carrier's possession of, interest in, or use of property, title to which 
is in the U.S. Government.

includes all applicable taxes and duties, except taxes and duties that 
the Government of the United States and the government of the country 
concerned have agreed shall not be applicable to expenditures in such

after-imposed tax or of any tax or duty specifically excluded from the 
contract price by a provision of this contract that the Carrier is 
required to pay or bear, including any interest or penalty, if the 
Carrier states in writing that the contract price does not include any 
contingency for such tax and if liability for such tax, interest, or 
penalty was not incurred through the Carrier's fault, negligence, or 
failure to follow instructions of the Contracting Officer or to comply 
with the provisions of paragraph (i) below.
    (e) The contract price shall be decreased by the amount of any 
after-relieved tax, including any interest or penalty. The Government of 
the United States shall be entitled to interest received by the Carrier 
incident to a refund of taxes to the extent that such interest was 
earned after the Carrier was paid by the Government of the United States 
for such taxes. The Government of the United States shall be entitled to 
repayment of any penalty refunded to the Carrier to the extent that the 
penalty was paid by the Government.
    (f) The contract price shall be decreased by the amount of any tax 
or duty, other than an

Contracting Officer or to comply with the provisions of paragraph (i) 
below.

clause unless the amount of the adjustment exceeds $250.

payment of any tax or duty that either was included in the contract 
price or was the basis of an increase in the contract price, the amount 
of the reduction shall be paid or credited to the Government of the 
United States as the Contracting Officer directs.
    (i) The Carrier shall take all reasonable action to obtain exemption 
from or refund of any taxes or duties, including interest or penalty, 
from which the United States Government, the Carrier, any subcontractor, 
or the transactions covered by this contract are exempt under the laws 
of the country concerned or its political subdivisions or which the 
governments of the United States and of the country concerned have 
agreed shall not be applicable to expenditures in such country by or on 
behalf of the United States.
    (j) The Carrier shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of all 
matters relating to taxes or duties that reasonably may be expected to 
result in either an increase or decrease in the contract price and shall 
take appropriate action as the Contracting Officer directs. The contract 
price shall be equitably adjusted to cover the costs of action taken by 
the Carrier at the direction of the Contracting Officer, including any 
interest, penalty, and reasonable attorneys' fees.

Sec. 1652.232-70  Payments--community-rated contracts.

    As prescribed in 1632.171, the following clause shall be inserted in 
all community-rated FEHBP contracts:

                           Payments (JAN 2000)

    (a) OPM will pay to the Carrier, in full settlement of its 
obligations under this contract, subject to adjustment for error or 
fraud, the subscription charges received for the plan by the Employees 
Health Benefits Fund (hereinafter called the Fund) less the amounts set 
aside by OPM for the Contingency Reserve and for the administrative 
expenses of OPM, amounts assessed under FEHBAR 1609.7101-2, and amounts 
for obligations due pursuant to paragraph (b) of this clause, plus any 
payments made by OPM from the Contingency Reserve.
    (b) OPM will notify the Carrier of amounts due for outstanding 
obligations under the contract. Not later than 60 days after the date of 
written notice from OPM, the Carrier shall reimburse OPM. If payment is 
not received within the prescribed time frame, OPM shall withhold the 
amount due from the subscription charges owed the Carrier under 
paragraph (a) of this clause.
    (c) The specific subscription rates, charges, allowances and 
limitations applicable to the contract are set forth in Appendix B.
    (d) Recurring payments from premiums shall be due and payable not 
later than thirty days after receipt by the Fund. The Contracting 
Officer may authorize special non-recurring payments from the 
Contingency Reserve in accordance with OPM's regulations.
    (e) In the event this contract between the Carrier and OPM is 
terminated or not renewed in accordance with General Provision 1.15, 
RENEWAL and WITHDRAWAL OF APPROVAL, the Contingency Reserve of the 
Carrier held by OPM shall be available to the Carrier to pay the 
necessary and proper charges against this contract to the extent that 
the reserves held by the Carrier are insufficient for that purpose.
    (f) Exception for the 3-Year DoD Demonstration Project (10 U.S.C. 
1108). The Carrier may, at its discretion, request funds from the 
Employees Health Benefits Fund to mitigate excessive costs in relation 
to premiums. If the Carrier requests funds from the Employees Health 
Benefits Fund to mitigate risk, it will be required to perform annual 
reconciliations for the duration of the demonstration project. OPM will 
reimburse the Carrier's costs significantly in excess of the premiums 
first from the Carrier's demonstration project Contingency Reserve and 
then from the Employees Health Benefits Fund Administrative Reserve. 
After the final accounting, OPM will place any surplus demonstration 
project premiums in the regular Contingency Reserves of all carriers 
continuing in the FEHB Program for the contract year following the year 
in which the demonstration project ends. Credit will be in proportion to 
the amount of subscription charges paid and accrued to each carrier's 
plan for the last year of the demonstration project.

Sec. 1652.232-71  Payments--experience-rated contracts.

    As prescribed in 1632.172, the following clause shall be inserted in 
all experience-rated FEHBP contracts:

                           Payments (JAN 2000)

    (a) OPM will pay to the Carrier, in full settlement of its 
obligations under this contract, subject to adjustment for error or 
fraud, the subscription charges received for the Plan by the Employees 
Health Benefits Fund (hereinafter called the Fund) less the amounts set 
aside by OPM for the Contingency Reserve and for the administrative 
expenses of OPM and amounts for obligations due pursuant to paragraph 
(b) of this clause, plus any payments made by OPM from the Contingency 
Reserve.
    (b) OPM will notify the Carrier of amounts due for outstanding 
obligations under the contract. Not later than 60 days after the date of 
written notice from OPM, the Carrier shall reimburse OPM. If payment is 
not received within the prescribed time frame, OPM shall withhold the 
amount due from the subscription charges owed the Carrier under 
paragraph (a) of this clause.
    (c) The specific subscription rates, charges, allowances and 
limitations applicable to the contract are set forth in Appendix B.
    (d) Recurring payments from premiums shall be made available for 
carrier drawdown not later than thirty days after receipt by the Fund. 
The Contracting Officer may authorize special non-recurring payments 
from the Contingency Reserve in accordance with OPM's regulations.
    (e) In the event this contract between the Carrier and OPM is 
terminated or not renewed in accordance with General Provision 1.15, 
RENEWAL and WITHDRAWAL OF APPROVAL, the Contingency Reserve of the 
Carrier held by OPM shall be available to the Carrier to pay the 
necessary and proper charges against this contract to the extent that 
the Carrier reserves are insufficient for that purpose.
    (f) Exception for the 3-Year DoD Demonstration Project (10 U.S.C. 
1108). The Carrier will perform a final reconciliation of revenue and 
costs for the demonstration project group at the end of the 
demonstration project. OPM will reimburse the Carrier's costs in excess 
of the premiums first from the Carrier's demonstration project 
Contingency Reserve and then from the Employees Health Benefits Fund 
Administrative Reserve. After the final accounting, OPM will place any 
surplus demonstration project premiums in the regular Contingency 
Reserves of all carriers continuing in the FEHB Program for the contract 
year following the year in which the demonstration project ends. Credit 
will be in proportion to the amount of subscription charges paid and 
accrued to each carrier's plan for the last year of the demonstration 
project.

all contracts based on cost analysis.

                   Non-Commingling of Funds (JAN 1991)

    (a) The Carrier and/or its underwriter shall keep all FEHBP funds 
for this contract (cash and investments) physically separate from funds 
obtained from other sources. Accounting for such FEHBP funds shall not 
be based on allocations or other sharing mechanisms and shall agree with 
the Carrier's accounting records.
    (b) In certain instances the physical separation of FEHBP funds may 
not be practical or desirable. In such cases, the Carrier may request a 
waiver from this requirement from the Contracting Officer. The waiver 
shall be requested in advance and the Carrier shall demonstrate that 
accounting techniques have been established that will clearly measure 
FEHBP cash and investment income (i.e., subsidiary ledgers). 
Reconciliations between amounts reported and actual amounts shown in 
accounting records shall be provided as supporting schedules to the 
Annual Accounting Statements.
    (c) The Carrier shall incorporate this clause in all subcontracts 
that exceed $25,000 and shall substitute ``contractor'' or other 
appropriate reference for ``Carrier and/or its underwriter.''

Assignment of Claims, the Carrier shall not make any assignment under 
the Assignment of Claims

[[Page 160]]

Act without the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer.
    (b) Unless a different period is specified in the Contracting 
Officer's written approval, an assignment shall be in force only for a 
period f 1 year from the date of the Contracting Officer's approval. 
However, assignments may be renewed upon their expiration.

    As prescribed in section 1643.205-70, the following clause shall be

            Changes--Negotiated Benefits Contracts (JAN 1998)

    (a) The Contracting Officer may at any time, by written order, and 
without notice to the sureties, if any, make changes within the general 
scope of this contract in any one or more of the following:
    (1) Description of services to be performed.
    (2) Time of performance (i.e., hours of the day, days of the week, 
etc.).
    (3) Place of performance of the services.
    (b) If any such change causes an increase or decrease in the cost 
of, or the time required for, performance of any part of the work under 
this contract, whether or not changed by the order, the Contracting 
Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the contract price, the 
delivery schedule, or both, and shall modify the contract.
    (c) The Carrier must assert its right to an adjustment under this 
clause within 30 days from the date of receipt of the written order. 
However, if the Contracting Officer decides that the facts justify it, 
the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon a proposal submitted 
before final payment of the contract.
    (d) Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a dispute under the 
Disputes clause. However, nothing in this clause shall excuse the 
Carrier from proceeding with the contract as changed.

Sec. 1652.244-70  Subcontracts.

    As prescribed in section 1644.270, the following clause will be 
inserted in all FEHB Program contracts based on cost analysis 
(experience-rated):

                         Subcontracts (JUL 2005)

    (a) The carrier will notify the Contracting officer in writing at 
least 30 days in advance of entering into any subcontract or subcontract 
modification, or as otherwise specified by this contract, if the amount 
of the subcontract or modification charged to the FEHB Program equals or 
exceeds $550,000 and is at least 25 percent of the total subcontract 
cost. The amount of the dollar charge to the FEHB Program shall be 
adjusted by the same amount and at the same time as any change to the 
threshold for application of the Truth in Negotiations Act pursuant to 
41 U.S.C. 254b(a)(7). Failure to provide advance notice may result in a 
Contracting officer's disallowance of subcontract costs or a penalty in 
the performance aspect of the carrier's service charge. In determining 
whether the amount chargeable to the FEHB Program contract for a given 
subcontract or modification equals or exceeds the $550,000 threshold, 
the following rules apply:
    (1) For initial advance notification, the carrier shall add the 
total cost/price for the base year and all options, including quantity 
or service options and option periods.
    (2) For contract modifications, options and/or renewals (e.g. 
evergreen contracts) not accounted for in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
clause, the carrier shall provide advance notification if they cause the 
total price to equal or exceed the threshold. OPM's review will be of 
the modification(s), itself, but documentation for the original 
subcontract will be required to perform the review. The $550,000 
threshold will be adjusted by the same amount and at the same time as 
any change to the threshold for application of the Truth in Negotiations 
Act. All subcontracts or subcontract modifications that equal or exceed 
the threshold are subject to audit under FAR 52.215-2 ``Audit and 
Records--Negotiations'' if based on cost analysis or 48 CFR 1646.301 and 
1552.246-70 ``FEHB Inspection'' if based on price analysis.
    (b) The advance notification required by paragraph (a) of this 
clause will include the information specified below:
    (1) A description of the supplies or services to be subcontracted;
    (2) Identification of the type of subcontract to be used;
    (3) Identification of the proposed subcontractor and an explanation 
of why and how the proposed subcontractor was selected, including the 
competition obtained;
    (4) The proposed subcontract price and the carrier's cost or price 
analysis;
    (5) The subcontractor's current, complete, and accurate cost or 
pricing data and a Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data must be 
submitted to the Contracting officer if required by law, regulation, or 
other contract provisions.

[[Page 161]]

    (6) [Reserved]
    (7) A negotiation memorandum reflecting--
    (i) The principal elements of the subcontract price negotiations;
    (ii) The most significant consideration controlling establishment of 
initial or revised prices;
    (iii) An explanation of the reason cost or pricing data are not 
required, if the carrier believes that cost or pricing data are not 
required.
    (iv) The extent, if any, to which the carrier did not rely on the 
subcontractor's cost or pricing data in determining the price objective 
and in negotiating the final price;
    (v) The extent, if any, to which it was recognized in the 
negotiation that the subcontractor's cost or pricing data were not 
accurate, complete, or current; the action taken by the carrier and the 
subcontractor; and the effect of any such defective data on the total 
price negotiated;
    (vi) The reasons for any significant difference between the 
carrier's price objective and the price negotiated; and
    (vii) A complete explanation of the incentive fee or profit plan, 
when incentives are used. The explanation will identify each critical 
performance element, management decisions used to quantify each 
incentive element, reasons for the incentives, and a summary of all 
trade-off possibilities considered.
    (c) The carrier will obtain the Contracting officer's written 
consent before placing any subcontract for which advance notification is 
required under paragraph (a) of this clause. However, the Contracting 
officer may ratify in writing any such subcontract for which written 
consent was not obtained. Ratification will constitute the consent of 
the Contracting officer.
    (d) The Contracting officer may waive the requirement for advance 
notification and consent required by paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this 
clause where the carrier and subcontractor submit an application or 
renewal as a contractor team arrangement as defined in FAR Subpart 9.6 
and--
    (1) The Contracting officer evaluated the arrangement during 
negotiation of the contract or contract renewal; and
    (2) The subcontractor's price and/or costs were included in the 
Plan's rates that were reviewed and approved by the Contracting officer 
during negotiation of the contract or contract renewal.
    (e) If the carrier follows the notification and consent requirements 
of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this clause and subsequently obtains 
the Contracting officer's consent or ratification, then the 
reasonableness of the subcontract's costs will be inferred as provided 
for in 1631.205-81. However, consent or ratification by the Contracting 
officer will not constitute a determination:
    (1) Of the acceptability of any subcontract terms or conditions;
    (2) Of the allowability of any cost under this contract; or
    (3) That the carrier should be relieved of any responsibility for 
performing this contract.
    (f) No subcontract placed under this contract will provide for 
payment on a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost basis. Any fee payable under 
cost reimbursement type subcontracts will not exceed the fee limitations 
in FAR 15.404-4(c)(4)(i). Any profit or fee payable under a subcontract 
will be in accordance with the provision of Section 3.7, Service Charge.
    (g) The carrier will give the Contracting officer immediate written 
notice of any action or suit filed and prompt notice of any claim made 
against the carrier by any subcontractor or vendor that, in the opinion 
of the carrier, may result in litigation related in any way to this 
contract with respect to which the carrier may be entitled to 
reimbursement from the Government.

Sec. 1652.245-70  Government property (negotiated benefits contracts).

    As prescribed in section 1645.303-70, the following clause shall be 
inserted in all FEHBP contracts.

     Government Property (Negotiated Benefits Contracts) (JAN 1998)

    (a) Government-furnished property. (1) The Government shall deliver 
to the Carrier, for use in connection with and under the terms of this 
contract, the Government-furnished property described in this contract 
together with any related data and information that the Carrier may 
request and is reasonably required for the intended use of the property 
(hereinafter referred to as ``Government-furnished property'').
    (2) The delivery or performance dates for this contract are based 
upon the expectation that Government-furnished property suitable for use 
(except for property furnished ``as-is'') will be delivered to the 
Carrier at the times stated in this contract or, if not so stated, in 
sufficient time to enable the Carrier to meet the contract's performance 
dates.
    (3) If Government-furnished property is received by the Carrier in a 
condition not suitable for the intended use, the Carrier shall, upon 
receipt of it, notify the Contracting Officer, detailing the facts, and, 
as directed by the Contracting Officer and at Government expense, either 
repair, modify, return, or

[[Page 162]]

otherwise dispose of the property. After completing the directed action 
and upon written request of the Carrier, the Contracting Officer shall 
make an equitable adjustment as provided in paragraph (h) of this 
clause.
    (b) Changes in Government-furnished property. (1) The Contracting 
Officer may, by written notice, (i) decrease the Government-furnished 
property provided or to be provided under this contract, or (ii) 
substitute other Government-furnished property for the property to be 
provided by the Government, or to be acquired by the Carrier for the 
Government, under this contract. The Carrier shall promptly take such 
action as the Contracting Officer may direct regarding the removal, 
shipment, or disposal of the property covered by such notice.
    (2) Upon the Carrier's written request, the Contracting Officer 
shall make an equitable adjustment to the contract in accordance with 
paragraph (h) of this clause, if the Government has agreed in this 
contract to make the property available for performing this contract and 
there is any--
    (i) Decrease or substitution in this property pursuant to 
subparagraph (b)(1) above; or
    (ii) Withdrawal of authority to use this property, if provided under 
any other contract or lease.
    (c) Title in Government property. (1) The Government shall retain 
title to all Government-furnished property.
    (2) All Government-furnished property and all property acquired by 
the Carrier, title to which vests in the Government under this paragraph 
(collectively referred to as ``Government property''), are subject to 
the provisions of this clause. Title to Government property shall not be 
affected by its incorporation into or attachment to any property not 
owned by the Government, nor shall Government property become a fixture 
or lose its identity as personal property by being attached to any real 
property.
    (d) Use of Government property. The Government property shall be 
used only for performing this contract, unless otherwise provided in 
this contract or approved by the Contracting Officer.
    (e) Property administration. (1) The Carrier shall be responsible 
and accountable for all Government property provided under this contract 
and shall comply with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 45.5, 
as in effect on the date of this contract.
    (2) The Carrier shall establish and maintain a program for the use, 
maintenance, repair, protection, and preservation of Government property 
in accordance with sound industrial practice and the applicable 
provisions of subpart 45.5 of the FAR.
    (3) If damage occurs to Government property, the risk of which has 
been assumed by the Government under this contract, the Government shall 
replace the items or the Carrier shall make such repairs as the 
Government directs. However, if the Carrier cannot effect such repairs 
within the time required, the Carrier shall dispose of the property as 
directed by the Contracting Officer. When any property for which the 
Government is responsible is replaced or repaired, the Contracting 
Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in accordance with paragraph 
(h) of this clause.
    (4) The Carrier represents that the contract price does not include 
any amount for repairs or replacement for which the Government is 
responsible. Repair or replacement of property for which the Carrier is 
responsible shall be accomplished by the Carrier at its own expense.
    (f) Access. The Government and all its designees shall have access 
at all reasonable times to the premises in which any Government property 
is located for the purpose of inspecting the Government property.
    (g) Risk of loss. Unless otherwise provided in this contract, the 
Carrier assumes the risk of, and shall be responsible for, any loss or 
destruction of, or damage to, Government property upon its delivery to 
the Carrier. However, the Carrier is not responsible for reasonable wear 
and tear to Government property or for Government property properly 
consumed in performing this contract.
    (h) Equitable adjustment. When this clause specifies an equitable 
adjustment, it shall be made to any affected contract provision in 
accordance with the procedures of the Changes clause. When appropriate, 
the Contracting Officer may initiate an equitable adjustment in favor of 
the Government. The right to an equitable adjustment shall be the 
Carrier's exclusive remedy. The Government shall not be liable to suit 
for breach of contract for--
    (1) Any delay in delivery of Government-furnished property;
    (2) Delivery of Government-furnished property in a condition not 
suitable for its intended use;
    (3) A decrease in or substitution of Government-furnished property; 
or
    (4) Failure to repair or replace Government property for which the 
Government is responsible.
    (i) Final accounting and disposition of Government property. Upon 
completing this contract, or at such earlier dates as may be fixed by 
the Contracting Officer, the Carrier shall submit, in a form acceptable 
to the Contracting Officer, inventory schedules covering all items of 
Government property (including any resulting scrap) not consumed in 
performing this contract or delivered to the Government. The Carrier 
shall prepare for shipment, deliver f.o.b. origin, or dispose of the 
Government property as may be directed or authorized by the Contracting 
Officer. The net proceeds of any such disposal shall be credited to the 
contract price or

[[Page 163]]

shall be paid to the Government as the Contracting Officer directs.
    (j) Abandonment and restoration of Carrier's premises. Unless 
otherwise provided herein, the Government--
    (1) May abandon any Government property in place, at which time all 
obligations of the Government regarding such abandoned property shall 
cease; and
    (2) Has no obligation to restore or rehabilitate the Carrier's 
premises under any circumstances (e.g., abandonment, disposition upon 
completion of need, or upon contract completion). However, if the 
Government-furnished property is withdrawn or is unsuitable for the 
intended use, or if other Government property is substituted, then the 
equitable adjustment under paragraph (h) of this clause may properly 
include restoration or rehabilitation costs.
    (k) Communications. All communications under this clause shall be in 
writing.
    (l) Overseas contracts. If this contract is to be performed outside 
of the United States of America, its territories, or possessions, the 
words ``Government'' and ``Government-furnished'' (wherever they appear 
in this clause) shall be construed as ``United States Government'' and 
``United States Government-furnished'', respectively.

Contracting officer, has the right to inspect or evaluate the work 
performed or being performed under the contract, and the premises where 
the work is being performed, at all reasonable times and in a manner 
that will not unreasonably delay the work.
    (b) The Contractor shall maintain and the Contracting officer, or an 
authorized representative of the Contracting officer, shall have the 
right to examine and audit all books and records relating to the 
contract for purposes of the Contracting officer's determination of the 
carrier's subcontractor or Large Provider's compliance with the terms of 
the contract, including its payment (including rebate and other 
financial arrangements) and performance provisions. The Contractor shall 
make available at its office at all reasonable times those books and 
records for examination and audit for the record retention period 
specified in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Acquisition 
Regulation (FEHBAR), 48 CFR 1652.204-70. This subsection is applicable 
to subcontract and Large Provider Agreements with the exception of those 
that are subject to the ``Audits and Records--Negotiation'' clause, 48 
CFR 52.215-2.
    (c) If the Contracting officer, or an authorized representative of 
the Contracting officer, performs inspection, audit or evaluation on the 
premises of the carrier, the subcontractor, or the Large Provider, the 
carrier shall furnish or require the subcontractor or Large Provider to 
furnish all reasonable facilities for the same and convenient 
performance of these duties.
    (d) The carrier shall insert this clause, including this subsection 
(d), in all subcontracts for underwriting and claim payments and 
administrative services and in all Large Provider Agreements and shall 
substitute ``contractor'' ``Large Provider,'' or other appropriate 
reference for the term ``carrier.''

for a term of 1 year each January 1st, unless written notice of intent 
not to renew is given either by OPM or the Carrier not less than 60 
calendar days before the renewal date, or unless modified by mutual 
agreement.
    (b) This contract also may be terminated at other times by order of 
OPM pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8902(e). After OPM notifies the Carrier of its 
intent to terminate the contract, OPM may take action as it deems 
necessary to protect the interests of members, including but not limited 
to--
    (1) Suspending new enrollments under the contract;
    (2) Advising enrollees of the asserted deficiencies; and

inserted in all FEHBP contracts.

FEHBP Termination for Convenience of the Government--Negotiated Benefits 
                          Contracts (JAN 1998)

    (a) The Government may terminate performance of work under this 
contract in whole or, from time to time, in part if the Contracting 
Officer determines that a termination is in the Government's interest. 
The Contracting Officer shall terminate by delivering to the Carrier a 
Notice of Termination specifying the extent of terminating and the 
effective date.
    (b) After receipt of a Notice of Termination, and except as directed 
by the Contracting Officer, the Carrier shall immediately proceed with 
the following obligations, regardless of any delay in determining or 
adjusting any amounts due under this clause:
    (1) Stop work as specified in the notice.
    (2) Place no further subcontracts except as necessary to complete 
the continued portion of the contract.
    (3) Terminate all subcontracts to the extent they relate to the work 
terminated.
    (4) Assign to the Government, as directed by the Contracting 
Officer, all right, title, and interest of the Carrier under the 
subcontracts terminated, in which case the Government shall have the 
right to settle or to pay any termination settlement proposal arising 
out of those terminations.
    (5) With approval or ratification to the extent required by the 
Contracting Officer, settle all outstanding liabilities and termination 
settlement proposals arising from the termination of subcontracts; the 
approval or ratification will be final for purposes of this clause.
    (6) As directed by the Contracting Officer, deliver to the 
Government any data, reports, or studies that, if the contract had been 
completed, would be required to be furnished to the Government.
    (7) Complete performance of the work not terminated.
    (c) After termination, the Carrier shall submit a final termination 
settlement proposal to the Contracting Officer in the form and with the 
certification prescribed by the Contracting Officer. The Carrier shall 
submit the proposal promptly, but no later than 1 year from the 
effective date of termination, unless extended in writing by the 
Contracting Officer upon written request of the Carrier within this 1-
year period. However, if the Contracting Officer determines that the 
facts justify it, a termination settlement proposal may be received and 
acted on after 1 year or any extension. If the Carrier fails to submit 
the proposal within the time allowed, the Contracting Officer may 
determine, on the basis of information available, the amount, if any, 
due the Carrier because of the termination and shall pay the amount 
determined.
    (d) Subject to paragraph (c) of this clause, the Carrier and the 
Contracting Officer may agree upon the whole or any part of the amount 
to be paid or remaining to be paid because of the termination. The 
amount may include a reasonable allowance for profit on work done. 
However, the agreed amount, whether under this paragraph (d) or 
paragraph (e) of this clause, exclusive of costs shown in subparagraph 
(e)(3) of this clause, may not exceed the total contract price as 
reduced by (1) the amount of payments previously made and (2) the 
contract price of work not terminated. The contract shall be modified, 
and the Carrier paid the agreed amount. Paragraph (e) of this clause 
shall not limit, restrict, or affect the amount that may be agreed upon 
to be paid under this paragraph.
    (e) If the Carrier and the Contracting Officer fail to agree on the 
whole amount to be paid because of the termination of work, the 
Contracting Officer shall pay the Carrier the amounts determined by the 
Contracting Officer as follows, but without duplication of any amounts 
agreed on under paragraph (d) above:
    (1) The contract price for completed services accepted by the 
Government not previously paid for.
    (2) The total of--
    (i) The costs incurred in the performance of the work terminated, 
including initial costs and preparatory expense allocable thereto, but 
excluding any costs attributable to services paid or to be paid under 
paragraph (e)(1) of this clause;
    (ii) The cost of settling and paying termination settlement 
proposals under terminated subcontracts that are properly chargeable to 
the terminated portion of the contract if not included in subdivision 
(e)(2)(i) of this clause; and
    (iii) A sum, as profit on subdivision (e)(2)(i) of this clause, 
determined by the Contracting Officer under 49.202 of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation, in effect on the date of this contract, to be 
fair and reasonable.
    (3) The reasonable costs of settlement of the work terminated, 
including--

[[Page 165]]

    (i) Accounting, legal, clerical, and other expenses reasonably 
necessary for the preparation of termination settlement proposals and 
supporting data;
    (ii) The termination and settlement of subcontracts (excluding the 
amounts of such settlements); and
    (f) The cost principles and procedures of part 31 of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation, in effect on the date of this contract, shall 
govern all costs claimed, agreed to, or determined under this clause.
    (g) The Carrier shall have the right of appeal, under the Disputes 
clause, from any determination made by the Contracting Officer under 
paragraph (c), (e), or (i) of this clause, except that if the Carrier 
failed to submit the termination settlement proposal or request for 
equitable adjustment within the time provided in paragraph (c) or (i), 
respectively, and failed to request a time extension, there is no right 
of appeal.
    (h) In arriving at the amount due the Carrier under this clause, 
there shall be deducted--
    (1) All unliquidated advance or other payments to the Carrier under 
the terminated portion of this contract;
    (2) Any claim which the Government has against the Carrier under 
this contract; and
    (i) If the termination is partial, the Carrier may file a proposal 
with the Contracting Officer for an equitable adjustment of the price(s) 
of the continued portion of the contract. The Contracting Officer shall 
make any equitable adjustment agreed upon. Any proposal by the Carrier 
for an equitable adjustment under this clause shall be requested within 
90 days from the effective date of termination unless extended in 
writing by the Contracting Officer.
    (j)(1) The Government may, under the terms and conditions it 
prescribes, make partial payments and payments against costs incurred by 
the Carrier for the terminated portion of the contract, if the 
Contracting Officer believes the total of these payments will not exceed 
the amount to which the Carrier will be entitled.
    (2) If the total payments exceed the amount finally determined to be 
due, the Carrier shall repay the excess to the Government upon demand, 
together with interest computed at the rate established by the Secretary 
of the Treasury under 50 U.S.C. App. 1215(b)(2). Interest shall be 
computed for the period from the date the excess payment is received by 
the Carrier to the date the excess is repaid.
    (k) Unless otherwise provided in this contract or by statute, the 
Carrier shall maintain all records and documents relating to the 
terminated portion of this contract for 3 years after final settlement. 
This includes all books and other evidence bearing on the Carrier's 
costs and expenses under this contract. The Carrier shall make these 
records and documents available to the Government, at the Carrier's 
office, at all reasonable times, without any direct charge. If approved 
by the Contracting Officer, photographs, microphotographs, or other 
authentic reproductions may be maintained instead of original records 
and documents.

<R05>
Sec. 1652.249-72  FEHBP termination for default--negotiated benefits 
          contracts.

    As prescribed in Sec.  1649.101-72, the following clause shall be 
inserted in all FEHBP contracts.

 FEHBP Termination for Default--Negotiated Benefits Contracts (JAN 1998)

    (a) (1) The Government may, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, 
by written notice of default to the Carrier, terminate this contract in 
whole or in part if the Carrier fails to--
    (i) Perform the services within the time specified in this contract 
or any extension;
    (ii) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract 
(but see subparagraph (a)(2) below); or
    (iii) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (but see 
subparagraph (a)(2) below).
    (2) The Government's right to terminate this contract under 
subdivisions (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) above, may be exercised if the Carrier 
does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if authorized in 
writing by the Contracting Officer) after receipt of the notice from the 
Contracting Officer specifying the failure.
    (b) If the Government terminates this contract in whole or in part, 
it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the Contracting 
Officer considers appropriate, supplies or service similar to those 
terminated, and the Carrier will be liable to the Government for any 
excess costs for those supplies or services. However, the Carrier shall 
continue the work not terminated.
    (c) Except for defaults of subcontractors at any tier, the Carrier 
shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the 
contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or 
negligence of the Carrier. Examples of such causes include (1) acts of 
God or of the public enemy, (2) acts of the Government in either its 
sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, (4) floods, (5) epidemics, 
(6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and (9) 
unusually severe weather. In each instance the failure to perform must 
be beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the 
Carrier.

[[Page 166]]

    (d) If the failure to perform is caused by the default of a 
subcontractor at any tier, and if the cause of the default is beyond the 
control of both the Carrier and subcontractor, and without the fault or 
negligence of either, the Carrier shall not be liable for any excess 
costs for failure to perform, unless the subcontracted supplies or 
services were obtainable from other sources in sufficient time for the 
Carrier to meet the required delivery schedule.
    (e) If this contract is terminated for default, the Government may 
require the Carrier to transfer title and deliver to the Government, as 
directed by the Contracting Officer, any completed or partially 
completed information and contract rights that the Carrier has 
specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this 
contract.
    (f) If, after termination, it is determined that the Carrier was not 
in default, or that the default was excusable, the rights and 
obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had 
been issued for the convenience of the Government.
    (g) The rights and remedies of the Government in this clause are in 
addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this 
contract.

<R05>
Sec. 1652.370  Use of the matrix.

    (a) The matrix in this section lists the FAR and FEHBAR clauses to 
be used with contracts based on cost analysis and contracts based on a 
combination of cost and price analysis. Carriers shall submit initial 
applications and requests for renewals on the basis that the new 
contract or contract renewal will include the clauses indicated.
    (b) Certain contract clauses are mandatory for FEHBP contracts. 
Other clauses are to be used only when made applicable by pertinent 
sections of the FAR or FEHBAR. An ``M'' in the ``Use Status'' column 
indicates that the clause is mandatory. An ``A'' indicates that the 
clause is to be used only when the applicable conditions are met.
    (c) Clauses are incorporated in the contract either in full text or 
by reference. If the full text is to be used, the matrix indicates a 
``T''. If the clause is incorporated by reference, the matrix indicates 
an ``R''.

Sec. 1801.000  Scope of part.

    This part sets forth general information about the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Federal Acquisition 
Regulations (FAR) Supplement, also referred to as the NFS.

               Subpart 1801.1_Purpose, Authority, Issuance


<R05>
Sec. 1801.103  Authority. (NASA supplements paragraph (a))

    (a) Under the following authorities, the Administrator has delegated 
to the Assistant Administrator for Procurement authority to prepare, 
issue, and maintain the NFS:
    (i) The National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 (Public Law 85-
568; 42 U.S.C. 2451 et seq.).
    (ii) 10 U.S.C. chapter 137.
    (iii) Other statutory authority.
    (iv) FAR subpart 1.3.


<R05>
Sec. 1801.104  Applicability.

    The NFS applies to all acquisitions as defined in FAR Part 2 except 
those expressly excluded by the FAR or this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 1801.105  Issuance.


<R05>
Sec. 1801.105-1  Publication and code arrangement.

    (b)(i) The NFS is an integrated document that contains both 
acquisition regulations that require public comment and internal Agency 
guidance and procedures that do not require public comment. NASA 
personnel must comply with all regulatory and internal guidance and 
procedures contained in the NFS.
    (ii) NFS regulations that require public comment are issued as 
chapter 18 of title 48, CFR.
    (iii) The single official NASA-maintained version of the NFS is on 
the Internet (http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/
nfstoc.htm).

[69 FR 21762, Apr. 22, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 1801.105-2  Arrangement of regulations. (NASA supplements paragraph 
          (b))

    (b)(1)(A) Numbering of NFS text implementing the FAR shall be the 
same as that of the related FAR text, except when the NFS coverage 
exceeds one paragraph. In such case the NFS text is numbered by skipping 
a unit in the FAR 1.105-2(b)(2) prescribed numbering sequence. For 
example, two paragraphs implementing FAR 1.105-2(b)(1) are numbered 
1801.105-2(b)(1) (A) and (B), rather than (1) (i) and (ii). Further 
subdivision of the NFS implementing paragraphs would follow the 
prescribed sequence in FAR 1.105(b)(2).
    (B) NFS text that supplements the FAR is numbered the same as its 
FAR counterpart with the addition of a number 70 and up. For example, 
NFS supplement of FAR subsection 1.105-3 is numbered 1801.105-370. 
Supplemental text exceeding one paragraph is numbered using the FAR 
1.105-2(b)(2) prescribed numbering sequence without skipping a unit.
    (2) Subdivision numbering below the fourth level repeats the 
numbering sequence using italicized letters and numbers.

    This section implements NASA's acquisition-related aspects of 
Federal policies for assuring the security of unclassified automated 
information resources. Federal policies include, but are not limited to, 
the Computer Security Act of 1987 (40 U.S.C. 1441 et seq.), the Clinger-
Cohen Act of 1996 (40 U.S.C. 1401 et seq.), Public Law 106-398, section 
1061, Government Information Security Reform, OMB Circular A-130, 
Management of Federal Information Resources, and the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology security guidance and standards.

[67 FR 48815, July 26, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 1804.470-2  Policy.

    (a) NASA policies and procedures on security for automated 
information technology are prescribed in NPD 2810.1, Security of 
Information Technology, and in NPR 2810.1, Security of Information 
Technology. The provision of information technology (IT) security in 
accordance with these policies and procedures, is required in all 
contracts that include IT resources or services in which a contractor 
must have physical or electronic access to NASA's sensitive information 
contained in unclassified systems that directly support the mission of 
the Agency. This includes information technology, hardware, software, 
and the management, operation, maintenance, programming, and system 
administration of computer systems, networks, and telecommunications 
systems. Examples of tasks that require security provisions include:
    (1) Computer control of spacecraft, satellites, or aircraft or their 
payloads;
    (2) Acquisition, transmission or analysis of data owned by NASA with 
significant replacement costs should the contractor's copy be corrupted; 
and
    (3) Access to NASA networks or computers at a level beyond that 
granted the general public, e.g. bypassing a firewall.
    (b) The contractor must not use or redistribute any NASA information 
processed, stored, or transmitted by the contractor except as specified 
in the contract.

Sec. 1804.470-3  Security plan for unclassified Federal Information 
          Technology systems.

    (a) The requiring activity with the concurrence of the Center Chief 
Information Officer (CIO), and the Center Information Technology (IT) 
Security Manager, must determine whether an IT Security Plan for 
unclassified information is required.
    (b) IT security plans must demonstrate a thorough understanding of 
NPR 2810.1 and NPD 2810.1 and must include, as a minimum, the security 
measures and program safeguards planned to ensure that the information 
technology resources acquired and used by contractor and subcontractor 
personnel--
    (1) Are protected from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, 
or misuse of information processed, stored, or transmitted;
    (2) Can maintain the continuity of automated information support for 
NASA missions, programs, and functions;
    (3) Incorporate management, general, and application controls 
sufficient to provide cost-effective assurance of the systems' integrity 
and accuracy;
    (4) Have appropriate technical, personnel, administrative, 
environmental, and access safeguards;
    (5) Document and follow a virus protection program for all IT 
resources under its control; and
    (6) Document and follow a network intrusion detection and prevention 
program for all IT resources under its control.

[[Page 183]]

    (c) The contractor must be required to develop and maintain an IT 
System Security Plan, in accordance with NPR 2810.1, for systems for 
which the contractor has primary operational responsibility on behalf of 
NASA.
    (d) The contracting officer must obtain the concurrence of the 
Center Chief of Security before granting any contractor requests for 
waiver of the screening requirement contained in the clause at 1852.204-

Sec. 1809.206-70  Small businesses.

    If a small business otherwise eligible for award has been placed in 
a special status on a Qualified Products List (Mil-Bul-103) or the 
Qualified Manufacturers List (QML-38510) established as a part of the 
NASA Microelectronics Reliability Program and the contracting officer 
determines that the small business does not appear to have the capacity 
to perform, the certificate of competency procedures in FAR subpart 19.6 
are applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 1809.206-71  Contract clause.

    When qualified products (end items or components of end items) are 
being procured, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 
1852.209-70, Product Removal from Qualified Products List, in the 
solicitation and in the resulting contract.

         Subpart 1809.4_Debarment, Suspension, and Ineligibility


<R05>
Sec. 1809.403  Definitions.

    For purposes of FAR subpart 9.4 and this subpart, the Assistant 
Administrator for Procurement is the ``debarring official,'' the 
``suspending official,'' and the agency head's ``designee.''

   Subpart 1809.5_Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest


<R05>
Sec. 1809.505-4  Obtaining access to sensitive information.

    (b) In accordance with FAR 9.503, the Assistant Administrator for 
Procurement has determined that it would not be in the Government's 
interests for NASA to comply strictly with FAR 9.505-4(b) when acquiring 
services to support management activities and administrative functions. 
The Assistant Administrator for Procurement has, therefore, waived the 
requirement that before gaining access to other companies' proprietary 
or sensitive (see 1837.203-70) information contractors must enter 
specific agreements with each of those other companies to protect their 
information from unauthorized use or disclosure. Accordingly, NASA will 
not require contractors and subcontractors and their employees in 
procurements that support management activities and administrative 
functions to enter into separate, interrelated third party agreements to 
protect sensitive information from unauthorized use or disclosure. As an 
alternative to numerous, separate third party agreements, 1837.203-70 
prescribes detailed policy and procedures to protect contractors from 
unauthorized use or disclosure of their sensitive information. Nothing 
in this section waives the requirements of FAR 37.204 and 1837.204.

Sec. 1813.000  Scope of part.

    FAR Part 13 and 1813 do not apply to NASA Research Announcements 
(NRA) and Announcements of Opportunity (AO). These acquisitions shall be 
conducted in accordance with the procedures in 1835.016-71 and 1872, 
respectively. However, awards resulting from NRAs or AOs that are to be 
made as procurement instruments, can be made as either a contract or a 
purchase order. When a purchase order is used, it must not exceed the 
simplified acquisition threshold and must include the appropriate 
clauses pertaining to data rights, key personnel requirements, and any 
other requirements determined necessary by the contracting officer. 
Contracting officers must determine whether obtaining the contractor's 
acceptance of the order is necessary (see FAR 13.302-3(a)).

Offeror Representations and Certifications--Other Than Commercial Items, 
in simplified acquisitions exceeding the mircro-purchase threshold that 
are for other than commercial items. This provision shall not be used 
for acquisition of commercial items as defined in FAR 2.101.
    (2) This provision provides a single, consolidated list of 
certifications and representations for the acquisition of other than 
commercial items using simplified acquisition procedures and is attached 
to the solicitation for offerors to complete and return with their 
offer.
    (i) Use the provision with its Alternate I in solicitations for 
acquisitions that are for, or specify the use of recovered materials 
(see FAR 23.4).
    (ii) Use the provision with its Alternate II in solicitations for 
the acquisition of research, studies, supplies, or services of the type 
normally acquired from higher education institutions (see FAR 26.3).
    (iii) Use the provision with its Alternate III in solicitation which 
include the clause at FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data--General (see FAR

    (b) The contracting officer may insert a provision substantially the 
same as the provision at 1852.213-71, Evaluation--Other than Commercial 
Items, in solicitations using simplified acquisition procedures for 
other than commercial items when a trade-off source selection process 
will be used, that is, factors in addition to technical acceptability 
and price will be considered. (See FAR 13.106.)

essential requirements of the RFP or clearly demonstrates that the 
offeror does not understand the requirements;
    (2) In research and development acquisitions, a substantial design 
drawback is evident in the proposal, and sufficient correction or 
improvement to consider the proposal acceptable would require virtually 
an entirely new technical proposal; or
    (3) It contains major eficiencies or omissions or out-of-line costs 
which discussions with the offeror could not reasonably be expected to 
cure.

Sec. 1815.504  Award to successful offeror.

    The reference to notice of award in FAR 15.504 on negotiated 
acquisitions is a generic one. It relates only to the formal 
establishment of a contractual document obligating both the Government 
and the offeror. The notice is effected by the transmittal of a fully 
approved and executed definitive contract document, such as the award 
portion of SF 33, SF 26, SF 1449, or SF 1447, or a letter contract when 
a definitized contract instrument is not available but the urgency of 
the requirement necessitates immediate performance. In this latter 
instance, the procedures for

[[Page 194]]

approval and issuance of letter contracts shall be followed.

<R05>
Sec. 1816.303-70  Cost-sharing contracts.

    (a) Cost-sharing with for-profit organizations. (1) Cost sharing by 
for-profit organizations is mandatory in any contract for basic or 
applied research resulting from an unsolicited proposal, and may be 
accepted in any other contract when offered by the proposing 
organization. The requirement for cost-sharing may be waived when the 
contracting officer determines in writing that the contractor has no 
commercial, production, education, or service activities that would 
benefit from the results of the research, and the contractor has no 
means of recovering its shared costs on such projects.
    (2) The contractor's cost-sharing may be any percentage of the 
project cost. In determining the amount of cost-sharing, the contracting 
officer shall consider the relative benefits to the contractor and the 
Government. Factors that should be considered include--
    (i) The potential for the contractor to recover its contribution 
from non-Federal sources;
    (ii) The extent to which the particular area of research requires 
special stimulus in the national interest; and
    (iii) The extent to which the research effort or result is likely to 
enhance the contractor's capability, expertise, or competitive 
advantage.
    (b) Cost-sharing with not-for-profit organizations. (1) Costs to 
perform research stemming from an unsolicited proposal by universities 
and other educational or not-for-profit institutions are usually fully 
reimbursed. When the contracting officer determines that there is a 
potential for significant benefit to the institution cost-sharing will 
be considered.
    (2) The contracting officer will normally limit the institution's 
share to no more than 10 percent of the project's cost.
    (c) Implementation. Cost-sharing shall be stated as a minimum 
percentage of the total allowable costs of the project. The contractor's 
contributed costs may not be charged to the Government

[[Page 196]]

under any other contract or grant, including allocation to other 
contracts and grants as part of an independent research and development 
program.

    (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause substantially as 
stated at 1852.216-74, Estimated Cost and Fixed Fee, in cost-plus-fixed-
fee contracts.
    (c) The contracting officer may insert the clause at 1852.216-75, 
Payment of Fixed Fee, in cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts. Modifications to 
the clause are authorized.
    (d) The contracting officer may insert the clause at 1852.216-81, 
Estimated Cost, in cost-no-fee contracts that are not cost sharing or 
facilities contracts.
    (e) The contracting officer may insert a clause substantially as 
stated at 1852.216-87, Submission of Vouchers for Payment, in cost-
reimbursement solicitations and contracts.
    (f) When either FAR clause 52.216-7, Allowable Cost and Payment, or 
FAR clause 52.216-13, Allowable Cost and Payment--Facilities, is 
included in the contract, as prescribed at FAR 16.307 (a) and (g), the 
contracting officer should include the clause at 1852.216-89, Assignment 
and Release Forms.

                   Subpart 1816.4_Incentive Contracts


<R05>
Sec. 1816.402  Application of predetermined, formula-type incentives. 
          (NASA paragraphs 1, 2 and 3).

    When considering the use of a quality, performance, or schedule 
incentive, the following guidance applies:
    (1) A positive incentive is generally not appropriate unless--
    (i) Performance above the target (or minimum, if there are no 
negative incentives) level is of significant value to the Government;
    (ii) The value of the higher level of performance is worth the 
additional cost/fee;
    (iii) The attainment of the higher level of performance is clearly 
within the control of the contractor; and
    (iv) An upper limit is identified, beyond which no further incentive 
is earned.
    (2) A negative incentive is generally not appropriate unless--
    (i) A target level of performance can be established, which the 
contractor can reasonably be expected to reach with a diligent effort, 
but a lower level of performance is also minimally acceptable;
    (ii) The value of the negative incentive is commensurate with the 
lower level of performance and any additional administrative costs; and
    (iii) Factors likely to prevent attainment of the target level of 
performance are clearly within the control of the contractor.
    (3) When a negative incentive is used, the contract must indicate a 
level below which performance is not acceptable.

<R05>
Sec. 1816.402-2  Performance incentives.


<R05>
Sec. 1816.402-270  NASA technical performance incentives.

    (a) Pursuant to the guidelines in 1816.402, NASA has determined that 
a performance incentive shall be included in all contracts based on 
performance-oriented documents (see FAR 11.101(a)), except those awarded 
under the commercial item procedures of FAR part 12, where the primary 
deliverable(s) is (are) hardware with a total value (including options) 
greater than $25 million. Any exception to this requirement shall be 
approved in writing by the head of contracting activity. Performance 
incentives may be included in hardware contracts valued under $25 
million acquired under procedures other than FAR Part 12 at the 
discretion of the procurement officer upon consideration of the 
guidelines in 1816.402. Performance incentives, which are objective and 
measure hardware performance after delivery and acceptance, are separate 
from other incentives, such as cost or delivery incentives.
    (b) When a performance incentive is used, it shall be structured to 
be both positive and negative based on hardware performance after 
delivery and acceptance, unless the contract type requires complete 
contractor liability for product performance (e.g., fixed price). In 
this latter case, a negative incentive is not required. In structuring 
the incentives, the contract shall establish a standard level of 
performance based on the salient hardware performance requirement. This 
standard performance level is normally the contract's minimum 
performance requirement. No incentive amount is earned at this standard 
performance level. Discrete units of measurement based on the same 
performance parameter shall be identified for performance above and, 
when a negative incentive is used, below the standard. Specific 
incentive amounts shall be associated with each performance level from 
maximum beneficial performance (maximum positive incentive) to, when a 
negative incentive is included, minimal beneficial performance or total 
failure (maximum negative incentive). The relationship between any given 
incentive, either positive and negative, and its associated unit of 
measurement should reflect the value to the Government of that level of 
hardware performance. The contractor should not be rewarded for above-
standard performance levels that are of no benefit to the Government.
    (c) The final calculation of the performance incentive shall be done 
when hardware performance, as defined in the contract, ceases or when 
the maximum positive incentive is reached. When hardware performance 
ceases below the standard established in the contract and a negative 
incentive is included, the Government shall calculate the amount due and 
the contractor shall pay the Government that amount. Once hardware 
performance exceeds the standard, the contractor may request payment of 
the incentive amount associated with a given level of performance, 
provided that such payments shall not be more frequent than monthly. 
When hardware performance ceases above the standard level of 
performance, or when the maximum positive incentive is reached, the 
Government shall calculate the final performance incentive earned and 
unpaid and promptly remit it to the contractor.
    (d) When the deliverable hardware lends itself to multiple, 
meaningful measures of performance, multiple performance incentives may 
be established. When the contract requires the sequential delivery of 
several hardware items (e.g. multiple spacecraft), separate performance 
incentive structures may be established to parallel the sequential 
delivery and use of the deliverables.
    (e) In determining the value of the maximum performance incentives 
available, the contracting officer shall follow the following rules:
    (1) For a CPFF contract, the sum of the maximum positive performance 
incentive and fixed fee shall not exceed the limitations in FAR 15.404-
4(c)(4)(i).
    (2) For an award fee contract.
    (i) The individual values of the maximum positive performance 
incentive and the total potential award fee (including any base fee) 
shall each be at least one-third of the total potential contract fee. 
The remaining one-third of the total potential contract fee may

[[Page 198]]

be divided between award fee and the maximum performance incentive at 
the discretion of the contracting officer.
    (ii) The maximum negative performance incentive for research and 
development hardware (e.g., the first and second units) shall be equal 
in amount to the total earned award fee (including any base fee). The 
maximum negative performance incentives for production hardware (e.g., 
the third and all subsequent units of any hardware items) shall be equal 
in amount to the total potential award fee (including any base fee). 
Where one contract contains both cases described above, any base fee 
shall be allocated reasonably among the items.
    (3) For cost reimbursement contracts other than award fee contracts, 
the maximum negative performance incentives shall not exceed the total 
earned fee under the contract.

<R05>
Sec. 1816.405-270  CPAF contracts.

    (a) Use of an award fee incentive shall be approved in writing by 
the procurement officer. The procurement officer's approval shall 
include a discussion of the other types of contracts considered and 
shall indicate why an award fee incentive is the appropriate choice. 
Award fee incentives should not be used on contracts with a total 
estimated cost and fee less than $2 million per year. The procurement 
officer may authorize use of award fee for lower-valued acquisitions, 
but should do so only in exceptional situations, such as contract 
requirements having direct health or safety impacts, where the 
judgmental assessment of the quality of contractor performance is 
critical.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, an award 
fee incentive may be used in conjunction with other contract types for 
aspects of performance that cannot be objectively assessed. In such 
cases, the cost incentive is based on objective formulas inherent in the 
other contract types (e.g., FPI, CPIF), and the award fee provision 
should not separately incentivize cost performance.
    (c) Award fee incentives shall not be used with a cost-plus-fixed-
fee (CPFF) contract.

[63 FR 12998, Mar. 17, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 1816.405-271  Base fee.

    (a) A base fee shall not be used on CPAF contracts for which the 
periodic award fee evaluations are final (1816.405-273(a)). In these 
circumstances, contractor performance during any award fee period is 
independent of and has no effect on subsequent performance periods or 
the final results at contract completion. For other contracts, such as 
those for hardware or software development, the procurement officer may 
authorize the use of a base fee not to exceed 3 percent. Base fee shall 
not be used when an award fee incentive is used in conjunction with 
another contract type (e.g., CPIF/AF).
    (b) When a base fee is authorized for use in a CPAF contract, it 
shall be paid only if the final award fee evaluation is ``satisfactory'' 
or better. (See 1816.405-273 and 1816.405-275) Pending final evaluation, 
base fee may be paid during the life of the contract at defined 
intervals on a provisional basis. If the final

[[Page 199]]

award fee evaluation is ``poor/unsatisfactory'', all provisional base 
fee payments shall be refunded to the Government.

[62 FR 3478, Jan. 23, 1997. Redesignated and amended at 62 FR 36706, 
July 9, 1997; 63 FR 13133, Mar. 18, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 1816.405-272  Award fee evaluation periods.

    (a) Award fee evaluation periods, including those for interim 
evaluations, should be at least 6 months in length. When appropriate, 
the procurement officer may authorize shorter evaluation periods after 
ensuring that the additional administrative costs associated with the 
shorter periods are offset by benefits accruing to the Government. Where 
practicable, such as developmental contracts with defined performance 
milestones (e.g., Preliminary Design Review, Critical Design Review, 
initial system test), establishing evaluation periods at conclusion of 
the milestones rather than calendar dates, or in combination with 
calendar dates should be considered. In no case shall an evaluation 
period be longer than 12 months.
    (b) A portion of the total available award fee contract shall be 
allocated to each of the evaluation periods. This allocation may result 
in an equal or unequal distribution of fee among the periods. The 
contracting officer should consider the nature of each contract and the 
incentive effects of fee distribution in determining the appropriate 
allocation structure.

[62 FR 3478, Jan. 23, 1997. Redesignated at 62 FR 36706, July 9, 1997, 
as amended at 63 FR 13133, Mar. 18, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 1816.405-273  Award fee evaluations.

    (a) Service contracts. On contracts where the contract deliverable 
is the performance of a service over any given time period, contractor 
performance is often definitively measurable within each evaluation 
period. In these cases, all evaluations are final, and the contractor 
keeps the fee earned in any period regardless of the evaluations of 
subsequent periods. Unearned award fee in any given period in a service 
contract is lost and shall not be carried forward, or ``rolled-over,'' 
into subsequent periods.
    (b) End item contracts. On contracts, such as those for end item 
deliverables, where the true quality of contractor performance cannot be 
measured until the end of the contract, only the last evaluation is 
final. At that point, the total contract award fee pool is available, 
and the contractor's total performance is evaluated against the award 
fee plan to determine total earned award fee. In addition to the final 
evaluation, interim evaluations are done to monitor performance prior to 
contract completion, provide feedback to the contractor on the 
Government's assessment of the quality of its performance, and establish 
the basis for making interim award fee payments (see 1816.405-276(a)). 
These interim evaluations and associated interim award fee payments are 
superseded by the fee determination made in the final evaluation at 
contract completion. The Government will then pay the contractor, or the 
contractor will refund to the Government, the difference between the 
final award fee determination and the cumulative interim fee payments.
    (c) Control of evaluations. Interim and final evaluations may be 
used to provide past performance information during the source selection 
process in future acquisitions and should be marked and controlled as 
``Source Selection Information--See FAR 3.104''.

<R05>
Sec. 1816.405-274  Award fee evaluation factors.

    (a) Explicit evaluation factors shall be established for each award 
fee period.
    (b) Evaluation factors will be developed by the contracting officer 
based upon the characteristics of an individual procurement. Normally, 
technical and schedule considerations will be included in all CPAF 
contracts as evaluation factors. Cost control shall be included as an 
evaluation factor in all CPAF contracts. When explicit evaluation factor 
weightings are used, cost control shall be no less than 25 percent of 
the total weighted evaluation factors. The predominant consideration of 
the cost control evaluation

[[Page 200]]

should be a measurement of the contractor's performance against the 
negotiated estimated cost of the contract. This estimated cost may 
include the value of undefinitized change orders when appropriate.
    (c)(1) The technical factor, if used, must include consideration of 
risk management (including mission success, safety, security, health, 
export control, and damage to the environment, as appropriate) unless 
waived at a level above the contracting officer, with the concurrence of 
the project manager. The rationale for any waiver shall be documented in 
the contract file. When safety, export control, or security are 
considered under the technical factor, the award fee plan shall allow 
the following fee determinations, regardless of contractor performance 
in other evaluation factors, when there is a major breach of safety or 
security.
    (i) For evaluation of service contracts under 1816.405-273(a), an 
overall fee determination of zero for any evaluation period in which 
there is a major breach of safety or security.
    (ii) For evaluation of end item contracts under 1816.405-273(b), an 
overall fee determination of zero for any interim evaluation period in 
which there is a major breach of safety or security. To ensure that the 
final award fee evaluation at contract completion reflects any major 
breach of safety or security, in an interim period, the overall award 
fee pool shall be reduced by the amount of the fee available for the 
period in which the major breach occurred if a zero fee determination 
was made because of a major breach of safety or security.
    (2) A major breach of safety must be related directly to the work on 
the contract. A major breach of safety is an act or omission of the 
Contractor that consists of an accident, incident, or exposure resulting 
in a fatality or mission failure; or in damage to equipment or property 
equal to or greater than $1 million; or in any ``willful'' or ``repeat'' 
violation cited by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
(OSHA) or by a state agency operating under an OSHA approved plan.
    (3) A major breach of security may occur on or off Government 
installations, but must be directly related to the work on the contract. 
A major breach of security is an act or omission by the contractor that 
results in compromise of classified information, illegal technology 
transfer, workplace violence resulting in criminal conviction, sabotage, 
compromise or denial of information technology services, equipment or 
property damage from vandalism greater than $250,000, or theft greater 
than $250,000.
    (4) The Assistant Administrator for Procurement (Code HS) shall be 
notified prior to the determination of a zero award fee because of a 
major breach of safety or security.
    (d) In rare circumstances, contract costs may increase for reasons 
outside the contractor's control and for which the contractor is not 
entitled to an equitable adjustment. One example is a weather-related 
launch delay on a launch support contract. The Government shall take 
such situations into consideration when evaluating contractor cost 
control.
    (e) Emphasis on cost control should be balanced against other 
performance requirement objectives. The contractor should not be 
incentivized to pursue cost control to the point that overall 
performance is significantly degraded. For example, incentivizing an 
underrun that results in direct negative impacts on technical 
performance, safety, or other critical contract objectives is both 
undesirable and counterproductive. Therefore, evaluation of cost control 
shall conform to the following guidelines:
    (1) Normally, the contractor should be given a score of 0 for cost 
control when there is a significant overrun within its control. However, 
the contractor may receive higher scores for cost control if the overrun 
is insignificant. Scores should decrease sharply as the size of the 
overrun increases. In any evaluation of contractor overrun performance, 
the Government shall consider the reasons for the overrun and assess the 
extent and effectiveness of the contractor's efforts to control or 
mitigate the overrun.
    (2) The contractor should normally be rewarded for an underrun 
within its control, up to the maximum score allocated for cost control, 
provided the average numerical rating for all other

[[Page 201]]

award fee evaluation factors is 81 or greater (see 1816.405-275). An 
underrun shall be rewarded as if the contractor has met the estimated 
cost of the contract (see 1816.405-274(d)(3)) when the average numerical 
rating for all other factors is less than 81 but greater than 60.
    (3) The contractor should be rewarded for meeting the estimated cost 
of the contract, but not to the maximum score allocated for cost 
control, to the degree that the contractor has prudently managed costs 
while meeting contract requirements. No award shall be given in this 
circumstance unless the average numerical rating for all other award fee 
evaluation factors is 61 or greater.
    (f) When an AF arrangement is used in conjunction with another 
contract type, the award fee's cost control factor will only apply to a 
subjective assessment of the contractor's efforts to control costs and 
not the actual cost outcome incentivized under the basic contract type 
(e.g. CPIF, FPIF).
    (g)(1) The contractor's performance against the subcontracting plan 
incorporated in the contract shall be evaluated. Emphasis may be placed 
on the contractor's accomplishment of its goals for subcontracting with 
small business, HUBZone small business, women-owned small business, 
veteran-owned small business, and service-disabled veteran-owned small 
business concerns.
    (2) The contractor's performance against the contract target for 
participation as subcontractors by small disadvantaged business concerns 
in the NAICS Major Groups designated by the Department of Commerce (see 
FAR 19.201(c)) shall also be evaluated if the clause at FAR 52.219-26, 
Small Disadvantaged Business Participation--Incentive Subcontracting, is 
not included in the contract (see FAR 19.1204(c)).
    (3) The contractor's achievements in subcontracting high technology 
efforts as well as the contractor's performance under the Mentor-
Prot[eacute]g[eacute] Program, if applicable, may also be evaluated.
    (4) The evaluation weight given to the contractor's performance 
against the considerations in paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(3) of this 
section should be significant (up to 15 percent of available award fee). 
The weight should motivate the contractor to focus management attention 
to subcontracting with small, HUBZone, women-owned, veteran-owned, and 
service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns, and with small 
disadvantaged business concerns in designated NAICS Major Groups to the 
maximum extent practicable, consistent with efficient contract 
performance.
    (h) When contract changes are anticipated, the contractor's 
responsiveness to requests for change proposals should be evaluated. 
This evaluation should include the contractor's submission of timely, 
complete proposals and cooperation in negotiating the change.
    (i) Only the award fee performance evaluation factors set forth in 
the performance evaluation plan shall be used to determine award fee 
scores.
    (j) The Government may unilaterally modify the applicable award fee 
performance evaluation factors and performance evaluation areas prior to 
the start of an evaluation period. The contracting officer shall notify 
the contractor in writing of any such changes 30 days prior to the start 
of the relevant evaluation period.

Sec. 1816.405-275  Award fee evaluation scoring.

    (a) A scoring system of 0-100 shall be used for all award fee 
ratings. Award fee earned is determined by applying the numerical score 
to the award fee pool. For example, a score of 85 yields an award fee of 
85 percent of the award fee pool. No award fee shall be paid unless the 
total score is 61 or greater.
    (b) The following standard adjectival ratings and the associated 
numerical scores shall be used on all award fee contracts.
    (1) Excellent (100-91): Of exceptional merit; exemplary performance 
in a timely, efficient, and economical manner; very minor (if any) 
deficiencies with no adverse effect on overall performance.

[[Page 202]]

    (2) Very good (90-81): Very effective performance, fully responsive 
to contract requirements; contract requirements accomplished in a 
timely, efficient, and economical manner for the most part; only minor 
deficiencies.
    (3) Good (80-71): Effective performance; fully responsive to 
contract requirements; reportable deficiencies, but with little 
identifiable effect on overall performance.
    (4) Satisfactory (70-61): Meets or slightly exceeds minimum 
acceptable standards; adequate results; reportable deficiencies with 
identifiable, but not substantial, effects on overall performance.
    (5) Poor/Unsatisfactory (less than 61): Does not meet minimum 
acceptable standards in one or more areas; remedial action required in 
one or more areas; deficiencies in one or more areas which adversely 
affect overall performance.
    (c) As a benchmark for evaluation, in order to be rated 
``Excellent,'' the contractor must be under cost, on or ahead of 
schedule, and have provided excellent technical performance.
    (d) A scoring system appropriate for the circumstances of the 
individual contract requirement should be developed. Weighted scoring is 
recommended. In this system, each evaluation factor (e.g., technical, 
schedule, cost control) is assigned a specific percentage weighting with 
the cumulative weightings of all factors totaling 100. During the award 
fee evaluation, each factor is scored from 0-100 according to the 
ratings defined in 1816.405-275(b). The numerical score for each factor 
is then multiplied by the weighting for that factor to determine the 
weighted score. For example, if the technical factor has a weighting of 
60 percent and the numerical score for that factor is 80, the weighted 
technical score is 48 (80x60 percent). The weighted scores for each 
evaluation factor are then added to determine the total award fee score.

<R05>
Sec. 1816.405-276  Award fee payments and limitations.

    (a) Interim award fee payments. The amount of an interim award fee 
payment (see 1816.405-273(b)) is limited to the lesser of the interim 
evaluation score or 80 percent of the fee allocated to that interim 
period less any provisional payments (see paragraph (b) of this 
subsection) made during the period.
    (b) Provisional award fee payments. Provisional award fee payments 
are payments made within evaluation periods prior to an interim or final 
evaluation for that period. Provisional payments may be included in the 
contract and should be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. For a service 
contract, the total amount of award fee available in an evaluation 
period that may be provisionally paid is the lesser of a percentage 
stipulated in the contract (but not exceeding 80 percent) or the prior 
period's evaluation score. For an end item contract, the total amount of 
provisional payments in a period is limited to a percentage not to 
exceed 80 percent of the prior interim period's evaluation score.
    (c) Fee payment. The Fee Determination Official's rating for both 
interim and final evaluations will be provided to the contractor within 
45 calendar days of the end of the period being evaluated. Any fee, 
interim or final, due the contractor will be paid no later than 60 
calendar days after the end of the period being evaluated.

Sec. 1816.406-70  NASA contract clauses.

    (a) As authorized by FAR 16.406(e), the contracting officer shall 
insert the clause at 1852.216-76, Award Fee for Service Contracts, in 
solicitations and contracts when an award fee contract is contemplated 
and the contract deliverable is the performance of a service.
    (b) As authorized by FAR 16.406(e), the contracting officer shall 
insert the clause at 1852.216-77, Award Fee for End Item Contracts, in 
solicitations and contracts when an award fee contract is contemplated 
and the contract deliverables are hardware or other end items for which 
total contractor performance cannot be measured until the

[[Page 203]]

end of the contract. When the clause is used in a fixed-price award fee 
contract, it shall be modified by deleting references to base fee in 
paragraphs (a), and by deleting paragraph (c)(1), the last sentence of 
(c)(4), and the first sentence of (c)(5).
    (c) The contracting officer may insert a clause substantially as 
stated at 1852.216-83, Fixed Price Incentive, in fixed-price-incentive 
solicitations and contracts utilizing firm or successive targets. For 
items subject to incentive price revision, identify the target cost, 
target profit, target price, and ceiling price for each item.
    (d) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.216-84, 
Estimated Cost and Incentive Fee, in cost-plus-incentive-fee 
solicitations and contracts.
    (e) The contracting officer may insert the clause at 1852.216-85, 
Estimated Cost and Award Fee, in cost an award fee solicitations and 
contracts. When the contract includes performance incentives, use 
Alternate I. When the clause is used in a fixed-price award fee 
contract, it shall be modified to delete references to base fee and to 
reflect the contract type.
    (f) As provided at 1816.402-270, the contracting officer shall 
insert a clause substantially as stated at 1852.216-88, Performance 
Incentive, when the primary deliverable(s) is (are) hardware and total 
estimated cost and fee is greater than $25 million. A clause 
substantially as stated at 1852.216-88 may be included in lower dollar 
value hardware contracts with the approval of the procurement officer.

    (a)(i) NASA is committed to providing to small, veteran-owned small 
business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone, small 
disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns, maximum 
practicable opportunities to participate in Agency acquisitions at the 
prime contract level. The participation of NASA prime contractors in 
providing subcontracting opportunities to such entities is also an 
essential part of the Agency's commitment. The participation of these 
entities is particularly emphasized in high-technology areas where they 
have not traditionally dominated.
    (ii) NASA annually negotiates Agency small, service-disabled 
veteran-owned small business, HUBZone, small disadvantaged, and women-
owned small business prime and subcontracting goals with the Small 
Business Administration pursuant to section 15(g) of the Small Business 
Act (15 U.S.C. 644). In addition, NASA has the following statutory goals 
based on the total value of prime and subcontract awards:
    (A) Under Public Laws 101-144, 101-507, and 102-389, an annual goal 
of at

least 8 percent for prime and subcontract awards to small disadvantaged 
business (SDB) concerns, Historically Black Colleges and Universities 
(HBCUs), minority institutions (MIs), and women-owned small businesses 
(WOSBs) (see 1819.7000); and
    (B) Under 10 U.S.C. 2323, an annual goal of 5 percent for prime and 
subcontract awards to SDBs, HBCUs, and WOSBs.

                   Subpart 1819.70_NASA 8 Percent Goal


<R05>
Sec. 1819.7003  Contract clause.

    The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.219-76, NASA 
8 Percent Goal, in all solicitations and contracts other than those 
below the simplified acquisition threshold or when the contract, 
together with all its subcontracts, is to be performed entirely outside 
of any State, territory, or possession of the United States, the 
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the Trust 
Territory of the Pacific Islands.

[[Page 207]]

           Subpart 1819.71_NASA Rural Area Small Business Plan


<R05>
Sec. 1819.7101  Definition.

    Rural area means a county with a population of fewer than twenty 
thousand individuals.


<R05>
Sec. 1819.7102  General.

    Pursuant to Public Law 100-590, NASA established a Rural Area 
Business Enterprise Development Plan, including methods for encouraging 
prime and subcontractors to use small business concerns located in rural 
areas as subcontractors and suppliers. One method is to encourage the 
contractor to use its best efforts to comply with the intent of the 
statute.


<R05>
Sec. 1819.7103  Solicitation provision and contract clause.

    The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.219-74, Use 
of Rural Area Small Businesses, in solicitations and contracts that 
offer subcontracting possibilities or that are expected to exceed 
$500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction of public facility) unless the 
contract, together with all its subcontracts, is to be performed 
entirely outside of any State, territory, or possession of the United 
States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and 
the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.

        Subpart 1819.72_NASA Mentor-Prot[eacute]g[eacute] Program


<R05>
Sec. 1819.7201  Scope of subpart.

    The NASA Mentor-Prot[eacute]g[eacute] Program is designed to 
incentivize NASA prime contractors to assist small disadvantaged 
business (SDB) concerns, Historically Black Colleges and Universities 
(HBCUs), minority institutions (MIs), and women-owned small business 
(WOSB) concerns, in enhancing their capabilities to perform NASA 
contracts and subcontracts, foster the establishment of long-term 
business relationships between these entities and NASA prime 
contractors, and increase the overall number of these entities that 
receive NASA contract and subcontract awards.

[64 FR 10571, Mar. 5, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 1819.7202  Definitions.

    High-Tech is defined in 1819.001.


<R05>
Sec. 1819.7203  Non-affiliation.

    For purposes of the Small Business Act, a prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm 
may not be considered an affiliate of a mentor firm solely on the basis 
that the prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm is receiving developmental 
assistance referred to in 1819.7214 from such mentor firm under the 
Program. In addition, NASA shall not consider partial ownership, up to 
10 percent, of a Department of Defense (DOD)-sanctioned 
prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm by its DOD mentor to constitute affiliation.


<R05>
Sec. 1819.7204  Transportability of features from the Department of 
          Defense (DOD) Mentor-Prot[eacute]g[eacute] program to NASA 
          contractors.

    (a) In accordance with the benefits authorized by the DOD Mentor-
Prot[eacute]g[eacute] Program (Public Law 101-510, Section 831, as 
amended by Public Law 102-190, Section 814), a NASA contractor who is 
also an approved DOD mentor can transfer credit features to their NASA 
contracts.
    (b) NASA prime contractors, who are approved DOD mentors, can award 
subcontracts noncompetitively under their NASA contracts to the 
prot[eacute]g[eacute]s which they are assisting under the DOD Program 
(Public Law 101-510, Section 831(f)(2)).
    (c) NASA prime contractors may count the costs of developmental 
assistance provided of prot[eacute]g[eacute]s being assisted under the 
DOD Program toward meeting the goals in their subcontracting plans under 
their NASA prime contracts (Public Law 102-190, Section 814). 
Limitations which may reduce the value of this benefit include:
    (1) Credit toward attaining subcontracting goals is available only 
to the extent that the developmental assistance costs have not been 
reimbursed to the contractor by DOD as direct or indirect costs; or
    (2) The credit is available to meet the goals of a NASA 
subcontracting plan only to the extent that it has not been applied to a 
DOD subcontracting plan. The same unreimbursed developmental assistance 
costs cannot be counted toward meeting the subcontracting goals of more 
than one prime contract. These

[[Page 208]]

costs would accrue from credit for the multiples attributed to 
assistance provided by Small Business Development Centers, Historically 
Black Colleges and Universities and minority institutions.
    (d) The features identified in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this 
section point out the portability of features from the DOD Mentor-
Prot[eacute]g[eacute] Program to NASA prime contractors. NASA mentors 
will be held to show ``good faith'' by providing actual developmental 
assistance beyond transferring credit from activity in the DOD Program 
to NASA subcontracting plans.


<R05>
Sec. 1819.7205  General policy.

    (a) Eligible large business prime contractors, not included on the 
``List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement 
Programs'', who have at least one active subcontracting plan, and who 
are approved as mentor firms may enter into agreements with eligible 
entities (as defined in 1819.7209) as prot[eacute]g[eacute]s to provide 
appropriate developmental assistance to enhance the capabilities of 
prot[eacute]g[eacute]s to perform as subcontractors and suppliers. 
Eligible small business prime contractors, not included on the ``List of 
Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs'', 
and that are capable of providing developmental assistance to 
prot[eacute]g[eacute]s, may also be approved as mentors. An active 
mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] arrangement requires the 
prot[eacute]g[eacute] to be a subcontractor under the mentor's prime 
contract with NASA.
    (b) The Mentor-Prot[eacute]g[eacute] program may be used in cost 
reimbursement type contracts and contracts that include an award fee 
incentive. Costs incurred by a mentor to provide the developmental 
assistance described in 1819.7214 are allowable. Except for cost-plus-
award-fee contracts, such proposed costs shall not be included in the 
cost base used to develop a fee objective or to negotiate fee. On 
contracts with an award fee incentive, a contractor's Mentor-
Prot[eacute]g[eacute] efforts shall be evaluated under the award fee 
evaluations.

[62 FR 36707, July 9, 1997, as amended at 64 FR 10571, Mar. 5, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 1819.7206  Incentives for prime contractor participation.

    (a) Proposed mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] efforts, except for the 
extent of participation of prot[eacute]g[eacute]s as subcontractors, 
shall be evaluated under the Mission Suitability factor. The 
participation of SDB prot[eacute]g[eacute]s as subcontractors shall be 
evaluated separately as a Mission Suitability subfactor (see FAR 
15.304(c)(4) and 19.1202). The participation of other categories of 
prot[eacute]g[eacute]s as subcontractors may be evaluated separately as 
part of the evaluation of proposed subcontracted efforts.
    (b) Under contracts with award fee incentives, approved mentor firms 
shall be eligible to earn award fee associated with their performance as 
a mentor by performance evaluation period. For purposes of earning award 
fee, the mentor firm's performance shall be evaluated against the 
criteria described in the clause at 1852.219-79, Mentor Requirements and 
Evaluation. This award fee evaluation shall not include assessment of 
the contractor's achievement of FAR 52.219-9 subcontracting plan SDB 
goals or proposed monetary targets for SDB subcontracting (see FAR 
19.1203).

[64 FR 10571, Mar. 5, 1999, as amended at 65 FR 30013, May 10, 2000; 65

<R05>
Sec. 1819.7207  Measurement of Program success.

    The overall success of the NASA Mentor-Prot[eacute]g[eacute] Program 
encompassing all participating mentors and prot[eacute]g[eacute]s will 
be measured by the extent to which it results in:
    (a) An increase in the number, dollar value and percentage of 
subcontractors awarded to prot[eacute]g[eacute]s by mentor firms under 
NASA contracts since the date of entry into the Program;
    (b) An increase in the number and dollar value of contract and 
subcontract awards to prot[eacute]g[eacute] firms since the time of 
their entry into the Program (under NASA contracts, contracts awarded by 
other Federal agencies and under commercial contracts);
    (c) An increase in the number and dollar value of subcontracts 
awarded to a prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm by its mentor firm; and

[[Page 209]]

    (d) An increase in subcontracting with prot[eacute]g[eacute] firms 
in industry categories where they have not traditionally participating 
within the mentor firm's activity.


<R05>
Sec. 1819.7208  Mentor firms.

    (a) Eligibility:
    (1) Contractors eligible for receipt of government contracts;
    (2) Large prime contractors performing under contracts with at least 
one negotiated subcontracting plan as required by FAR 19.7; and
    (3) Small business prime contractors that can provide developmental 
assistance to enhance the capabilities of prot[eacute]g[eacute]s to 
perform as subcontractors and suppliers.
    (b) Mentors will be encouraged to identify and select as 
prot[eacute]g[eacute]s:
    (1) A broad base of firms including those defined as emerging firms 
(e.g., a prot[eacute]g[eacute] whose size is no greater than 50 percent 
of the size standard applicable to the NAICS code assigned to a 
contracting opportunity);
    (2) Firms in addition to those with whom they have established 
business relationships; and
    (3) High-tech firms.

[62 FR 36707, July 9, 1997, as amended at 65 FR 58932, Oct. 3, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 1819.7209  Prot[eacute]g[eacute] firms.

    (a) For selection as a prot[eacute]g[eacute], a firm must be:
    (1) An SDB in the NAICS Major Groups as determined by the Department 
of Commerce (see FAR 19.201(b)), HBCU, MI, or WOSB;
    (2) Certified as small in the NAICS code for the services or 
suppliers to be provided by the prot[eacute]g[eacute] under its 
subcontract to the mentor; and
    (3) Eligible for receipt of government contracts.
    (b) Except for SDBs, a prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm may self-certify 
to a mentor firm that it meets the requirements set forth in paragraph 
(a) of this section. Mentors may rely in good faith on written 
representations by potential prot[eacute]g[eacute]s that they meet the 
specified eligibility requirements. SDB status eligibility and 
documentation requirements are determined according to FAR 19.304.
    (c) Prot[eacute]g[eacute]s may have multiple mentors. 
Prot[eacute]g[eacute]s participating in mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] 
programs in addition to the NASA Program should maintain a system for 
preparing separate reports of mentoring activity for each agency's 
program.

[62 FR 36707, July 9, 1997, as amended at 64 FR 10571, Mar. 5, 1999; 65 
FR 58932, Oct. 3, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 1819.7210  Selection of prot[eacute]g[eacute] firms.

    (a) Mentor firms will be solely responsible for selecting 
prot[eacute]g[eacute] firms. The mentor is encouraged to identify and 
select the types of prot[eacute]g[eacute] firms listed in 1819.7208(b).
    (b) Mentor firms may have more than one prot[eacute]g[eacute].
    (c) The selection of prot[eacute]g[eacute] firms by mentor firms may 
not be protested, except for a protest regarding the size or eligibility 
status of an entity selected by a mentor to be a prot[eacute]g[eacute]. 
Such protests shall be handled in accordance with FAR 19.703(b). The 
contracting officer shall notify the Headquarters Office of Small and 
Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) (Code K) of the protest.

will not be reimbursed by the Government.
    (c) The NASA technical program manager shall include an assessment 
of the prime contractor's (mentor's) performance in the Mentor-
Prot[eacute]g[eacute] Program in a quarterly `Strengths and Weaknesses' 
evaluation report. A copy of this assessment will be provided to the 
OSDBU and the contracting officer.
    (d) The NASA Mentor-Prot[eacute]g[eacute] program manager will 
submit semi-annual reports to the cognizant contracting officer 
regarding the participating prime contractor's performance in the 
Program for use in the award fee determination process.

Sec. 1823.570-1  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart employee and controlled substance are as 
defined in FAR 23.503. The use of a controlled substance in accordance 
with the terms of a valid prescription, or other uses authorized by law 
shall not be subject to the requirements of 1823.570 through 1823.570-3 
and the clause at 1852.223-74.
    Employee in a sensitive position means a contractor or subcontractor 
employee who has been granted access to classified information; a 
contractor or subcontractor employee in other positions that the 
contractor or subcontractor determines could reasonably be expected to 
affect safety, security, National security, or functions other than the 
foregoing requiring a high degree of trust and confidence; and includes 
any employee performing in a position designated ``mission critical'' 
pursuant to the clause at 1852.246-70. The term also includes any 
applicant who is interviewed for a position described in this paragraph.
    Use, in violation of applicable law or Federal regulation, of 
alcohol includes having, while on duty or during a preemployment 
interview, an alcohol concentration of 0.04 percent by weight or more in 
the blood, as measured by chemical test of the individual's breath or 
blood. An individual's refusal to submit to such test is presumptive 
evidence of use, in violation of applicable law or Federal regulation, 
of alcohol.

    (a)(i) The Assistant Administrator for Procurement has determined 
that it is inconsistent with the public interest to apply restrictions 
of the Buy American Act to Canadian end products with estimated values 
of $25,000 or less as defined in 1825.003-70. Accordingly, contracting 
officers must evaluate all offers for such Canadian end products on a 
parity with offers for domestic end products, except that applicable 
duty (whether or not a duty free entry certificate may be issued) must 
be included in evaluating offers for Canadian end products.
    (ii) The Assistant Administrator for Procurement has determined that 
for procurements subject to the Trade Agreements Act, it would be 
inconsistent with the public interest to apply the Buy American Act to 
U.S.-made end products that are substantially transformed in the United 
States.

Sec. 1825.1103  Other provisions and clauses.


<R05>
Sec. 1825.1103-70  Export control.

    (a) Background. (1) NASA contractors and subcontractors are subject 
to U.S. export control laws and regulations, including the International 
Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 CFR parts 120 through 130, and 
the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), 15 CFR parts 730 through 
799. The contractor is responsible for obtaining the appropriate 
licenses or other approvals from the Department of State or the 
Department of Commerce when it exports hardware, technical data, or 
software, or provides technical assistance to a foreign destination or 
``foreign person'', as defined in 22 CFR 120.16, and there are no 
applicable or available exemptions/exceptions to the ITAR/EAR, 
respectively. A person who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence 
in the United States is not a ``foreign person''. (See 22 CFR 120.16 and 
15 CFR 734.2(b)(2)(ii))
    (2) The exemption at 22 CFR 125.4(b)(3) of the ITAR provides that a 
contractor may export technical data without a license if the contract 
between the agency and the exporter provides for the export of the data. 
The clause at 1852.225-70, Alternate I, provides contractual authority 
for the exemption, but the exemption is available only after the 
contracting officer, or designated representative, provides

[[Page 217]]

written authorization or direction enabling its use. It is NASA policy 
that the exemption at 22 CFR 125.4(b)(3) may only be used when technical 
data (including software) is exchanged with a NASA foreign partner 
pursuant to the terms of an international agreement in furtherance of an 
international collaborative effort. The contracting officer must obtain 
the approval of the Center Export Administrator before granting the 
contractor the authority to use this exemption.
    (b) Contract clause. Insert the clause at 1852.225-70, Export 
Licenses, in all solicitations and contracts, except in contracts with 
foreign entities. Insert the clause with its Alternate I when the NASA 
project office indicates that technical data (including software) is to 
be exchanged by the contractor with a NASA foreign partner pursuant to 
an international agreement.

<R05>
Sec. 1827.302  Policy. (NASA supplements paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), 
          (e), (f), (g), and (i)).

    (a) Introduction.
    (i) NASA policy with respect to any invention, discovery, 
improvement, or innovation made in the performance of work under any 
NASA contract or subcontract with other than a small business firm or a 
nonprofit organization and the allocation to related property rights is 
based upon Section 305 of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 
1958, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2457) (the Act); and, to the extent 
consistent with this statute, the Presidential Memorandum or Government 
Patent Policy to the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies, dated 
February 18, 1983, and Section 1(d)(4) of Executive Order 12591. NASA 
policy with respect to any invention made in the performance of 
experimental, developmental, or research work with a small business firm 
or a nonprofit organization is based on 35 U.S.C. Chapter 18, as 
amended.
    (ii) NASA contracts subject to Section 305 of the Act shall ensure 
the prompt reporting of reportable items in other to protect the 
Government's interest and to provide widest practicable and appropriate 
dissemination, early utilization, expeditious development, and continued 
availability for the benefit of the scientific, industrial, and 
commercial communities and the general public.
    (b) Contractor right to elect title.
    (i) For NASA contracts, the contractor right to elect title only 
applies to contracts with small businesses and non-profit organizations. 
For other business entities, see subdivision (ii) of this paragraph.
    (ii) Contractor right to request a waiver of title. For NASA 
contracts with other than a small business firm or a nonprofit 
organization (contracts subject to Section 305 of the Act), it is the 
policy of NASA to waive the rights (to acquire title) of the United 
States (with the reservation of a Government license set forth in FAR 
27.302(c) and the march-in rights of FAR 27.302(f) and 1827.302(f)) in 
and to any subject invention if the Administrator determines that the 
interests of the United States will be served. This policy, as well as 
the procedures and instructions for such waiver of rights, is stated in 
the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR Section 1245, Subpart 1. 
Waiver may be requested in advance of contract award for any or all of 
the subject inventions, or for individually identified subject 
inventions reported under the contract. When waiver of rights is 
granted, the contractor's right to title, the rights reserved by the 
Government, and other conditions and obligations of the waiver shall be 
included in an Instrument of Waiver executed by NASA and the party 
receiving the waiver.
    (iii) It is also a policy of NASA to consider for a monetary award, 
when referred to the NASA Inventions and Contributions Board, any 
subject invention reported to NASA in accordance with this subpart, and 
for which an application for patent has been filed.
    (c) Government license. For each subject invention made in the 
performance of work under a NASA contract with other than a small 
business firm or nonprofit organization and for which waiver of rights 
has been granted in accordance with 14 CFR Section 1245, Subpart 1, the 
Administrator shall reserve an irrevocable, nonexclusive, 
nontransferable, royalty-free license for the practice of such invention 
throughout the world by or on behalf of the United States or any foreign 
Government in accordance with any treaty or agreement of the United 
States.
    (d) Government right to receive title. Under any NASA contract with 
other than a small business or nonprofit organization (i.e., those 
contracts subject to Section 305(a) of the Act), title to subject 
inventions vests in NASA when the determinations of Section 305(a)(1) or 
305(a)(2) have been made. The Administrator may grant a waiver of title 
in accordance with 14 CFR Section 1245.
    (e) Utilization reports. For any NASA contract with other than a 
small business firm or a nonprofit organization, the requirements for 
utilization

[[Page 220]]

reports shall be as set forth in the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 
CFR Section 1245, Subpart 1, and any Instrument of Waiver executed under 
those Regulations.
    (f) March-in rights. For any NASA contract with other than a small 
business firm or a nonprofit organization, the march-in rights shall be 
as set forth in the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR Section 1245, 
Subpart 1, and any Instrument of Waiver executed under those 
Regulations.
    (g) Preference for United States industry. Waiver of the requirement 
for the agreement for any NASA contract with other than a small business 
firm or a nonprofit organization shall be in accordance with the NASA 
Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR Section 1245, Subpart 1.
    (i) Minimum rights to contractor.
    (1) For NASA contracts with other than a small business firm or a 
nonprofit organization (i.e., those contracts subject to Section 305(a) 
of the Act), where title to any subject inventions vests in NASA, the 
contractor is normally granted, in accordance with 14 CFR 1245, a 
revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license in each patent application 
filed in any country and in any resulting patent. The license extends to 
any of the contractor's domestic subsidiaries and affiliates within the 
corporate structure, and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the 
same scope to the extent the contractor was legally obligated to do so 
at the time the contract was awarded. The license and right are 
transferable only with the approval of the Administrator, except when 
transferred to the successor of that part of the contractor's business 
to which the invention pertains.
    (2) The Administrator is the approval authority for revoking or 
modifying a license. The procedures for revocation or modification are 
described in 37 CFR 404.10 and 14 CFR 1245.108.

contracting officer determines, with concurrence of the installation 
intellectual property counsel, that the objectives of the contract would 
be better served by use of the clause at FAR 52.227-13, Patent Rights--
Acquisition by the Government. For this purpose, the contracting officer 
may presume that a contractor is not a domestic firm unless it is known 
that the firm is not foreign owned, controlled, or influenced. (See FAR 
27.304-4(a) regarding subcontracts with U.S. firms.)

    (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.228-70, 
Aircraft Ground and Flight Risk, in all negotiated fixed-price contracts 
for the development, production, modification, maintenance, or overhaul 
of aircraft, or otherwise involving the furnishing of aircraft to the 
contractor, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, unless 
the aircraft are covered by a separate bailment. See the clause preface 
for directions for modifying the clause to accommodate various 
circumstances.
    (b) The Government need not assume the risk of aircraft damage, 
loss, or destruction as provided by the clause at 1852.228-70 if the 
best estimate of premium costs that would be included in the contract 
price for insurance coverage for such damage, loss, or destruction at 
any plant or facility is less than $500. If it is determined not to 
assume this risk, the clause at 1852.228-70 shall not be made a part of 
the contract, and the cost of necessary insurance to be obtained by the 
contractor to cover this risk shall be considered in establishing the 
contract price. In such cases, however, if performance of the contract 
is expected to involve the flight of Government-furnished aircraft, the 
substance of the clause at 1852.228-71, Aircraft Flight Risks, suitably 
adapted for use in a fixed-price contract, shall be used.
    (c) When the clause at 1852.228-70 is used, the term ``Contractor's 
premises'' shall be expressly defined in the contract Schedule and shall 
be limited to places where aircraft may be located during the 
performance of the contract. Contractor's premises may include, but are 
not limited to, those owned or leased by the contractor or those for 
which the contractor has a permit, license, or other right of use either 
exclusively or jointly with others, including Government airfields.

Sec. 1828.371  Clauses for cross-waivers of liability for Space Shuttle 
          services, Expendable Launch Vehicle (ELV) launches, and Space 
          Station activities.

    (a) In agreements covering Space Shuttle services, certain ELV 
launches, and Space Station activities, NASA and other signatories (the 
parties) agree not to bring claims against each other for any damage to 
property or for injury or death of employees that occurs during the time 
such a cross-waiver is in effect. These agreements involving NASA and 
other parties include, but are not limited to, Memoranda of 
Understanding with foreign Governments, Launch Services Agreements, and 
other agreements for

[[Page 226]]

the use of NASA facilities. These agreements require the parties to flow 
down the cross-waiver provisions to their related entities so that 
contractors, subcontractors, customers, and other users of each party 
also waive their right to bring claims against other parties and their 
similarly related entities for damages arising out of activities 
conducted under the agreements. The purpose of the clauses prescribed in 
this section is to flow down the cross-waivers to NASA contractors and 
subcontractors.
    (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause 1852.228-72, 
Cross-waiver of Liability for Space Shuttle Services, in solicitations 
and contracts of $100,000 or more when the work to be performed involves 
``Protected Space Operations'' (applicable to the Space Shuttle) as that 
term is defined in the clause. If Space Shuttle services under the 
contract are being conducted in support of the Space Station program, 
the contracting officer shall insert the clause prescribed by paragraph 
(d) of this section and designate application of the clause to those 
particular activities.
    (c) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.228-78, 
Cross-Waiver of Liability for NASA Expendable Launch Vehicle (ELV) 
Launches, in solicitations and contracts of $100,000 or more for the 
acquisition of ELV launch services when the service is being acquired by 
NASA pursuant to an agreement described in paragraph (a) of this 
section. If, under a contract that covers multiple launches, only some 
of the launches are for payloads provided pursuant to such agreements, 
an additional clause shall be inserted in the contract to designate the 
particular launches to which this clause applies. If a payload is being 
launched by use of an ELV in support of the Space Station program, the 
contracting officer shall insert the clause prescribed by paragraph (d) 
of this section and designate application of the clause to that 
particular launch.
    (d) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.228-76, 
Cross-Waiver of Liability for Space Station Activities, in solicitations 
and contracts of $100,000 or more when the work is to be performed 
involves ``Protected Space Operations'' (relating to the Space Station) 
as that term is defined in the clause.
    (e) At the contracting officer's discretion, the clauses prescribed 
by paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section may be used in 
solicitations, contracts, new work modifications, or extensions, to 
existing contracts under $100,000 involving Space Shuttle activities, 
ELV launch services, or Space Station activities, respectively, in 
appropriate circumstances. Examples of such circumstances are when the 
value of contractor property on a Government installation used in 
performance of the contract is significant, or when it is likely that 
the contractor or subcontractor will have its valuable property exposed 
to risk or damage caused by other participants in the Space Shuttle 
services, ELV launches, or Space Station activities.

<R05>
Sec. 1830.7001-4  Postaward FCCOM applications.

    (a) Interim billings based on costs incurred. (1) The contractor may 
include FCCOM in cost reimbursement and progress payment invoices. To 
determine the amount that qualifies as cost incurred, multiply the 
incurred portions of the overhead pool allocation bases by the latest 
available cost of money factors. These FCCOM calculations are interim 
estimates subject to adjustment.
    (2) As actual cost of money factors are finalized, use the new 
factors to calculate FCCOM for the next accounting period.
    (b) Final settlements. (1) Contract FCCOM for final cost 
determination or repricing is based on each year's final cost of money 
factors determined under CAS 414 and supported by separate Forms CASB-
CMF.
    (2) Separately compute contract FCCOM in a manner similar to yearly 
final overhead rates. As in overhead rates, include in the final 
settlement an adjustment from interim to final contract FCCOM. Do not 
adjust the contract estimated or target cost.

          construction.


<R05>
Sec. 1830.7002-1  Definitions.

    (a) Cost of money rate is either--
    (1) The interest rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury 
under Public Law 92-41 (85 Stat. 97); or
    (2) The time-weighted average of such rates for each cost accounting 
period during which the capital asset is being constructed, fabricated, 
or developed.
    (b) Representative investment is the calculated amount considered 
invested by the contractor during the cost accounting period to 
construct, fabricate, or develop the capital asset.


<R05>
Sec. 1830.7002-2  Cost of money calculations.

    (a) The interest rate referenced in 1830.7002-1(a)(1) is established 
semi-annually and published in the Federal Register during the fourth 
week of December and June.
    (b) To calculate the time-weighted average interest rate referenced 
in 1830.7002-1(a)(2), multiply the rates in effect during the months of 
construction by the number of months each rate was in effect, and then 
divide the sum of the products by the total number of months.


<R05>
Sec. 1830.7002-3  Representative investment calculations.

    (a) The calculation of the representative investment requires 
consideration of the rate or expenditure pattern of the costs to 
construct, fabricate, or develop a capital asset.
    (b) If the majority of the costs were incurred toward the beginning, 
middle, or end of the cost accounting period, the contractor shall 
either:
    (1) Determine a representative investment for the cost accounting 
period by calculating the average of the month-end balances for that 
cost accounting period; or
    (2) Treat month-end balances as individual representative 
investments.
    (c) If the costs were incurred in a fairly uniform expenditure 
pattern throughout the construction, fabrication, or development period, 
the contractor may either:
    (1) Determine a representative investment for the cost accounting 
period by averaging the beginning and ending balances of the 
construction, fabrication, or development cost account for the cost 
accounting period; or
    (2) Treat month-end balances as individual representative 
investments.
    (d) The method chosen by the contractor to determine the 
representative investment amount may be different for each capital asset 
being constructed, fabricated, or developed, provided the method fits 
the expenditure pattern of the costs incurred.

[[Page 228]]


<R05>
Sec. 1830.7002-4  Determining imputed cost of money.

    (a) Determine the imputed cost of money for an asset under 
construction, fabrication, or development by applying a cost of money 
rate (see 1830.7002-2) to the representative investment (see 1830.7002-
3).
    (1) When a representative investment is determined for a cost 
accounting period in accordance with 1830.7002-3(b)(1) or 1830.7002-
3(c)(1), the cost of money rate shall be the time-weighted average rate.
    (2) When a monthly representative investment is used in accordance 
with 1830.7002-3(b)(2) or 1830.7002-3(c)(2), the cost of money rate 
shall be that in effect each month. Under this method, the FCCOM is 
determined monthly, and the total for the cost accounting period is the 
sum of the monthly calculations.
    (b) The imputed cost of money will be capitalized only once in any 
cost accounting period, either at the end of the accounting period or 
the end of the construction, fabrication, or development period, 
whichever comes first.
    (c) When the construction, fabrication, or development of an asset 
takes more than one accounting period, the cost of money capitalized for 
the first accounting period will be included in determining the 
representative investment for any future cost accounting periods.

<R05>
Sec. 1835.016-70  Foreign participation under broad agency announcements 
          (BAAs).

    (a) Policy. (1) NASA seeks the broadest participation in response to 
broad agency announcements, including foreign proposals or proposals 
including foreign participation. NASA's policy is to conduct research 
with foreign entities on a cooperative, no-exchange-of-funds basis (see 
NPD 1360.2, Initiation and Development of International Cooperation in 
Space and Aeronautics Programs). NASA does not normally fund foreign 
research proposals or foreign research efforts that are part of U.S. 
research proposals. Rather, cooperative research efforts are implemented 
via international agreements between NASA and the sponsoring foreign 
agency or funding/sponsoring institution under which the parties agree 
to each bear the cost of discharging their respective responsibilities.
    (2) In accordance with the National Space Transportation Policy, use 
of a non-U.S. manufactured launch vehicle is permitted only on a no-
exchange-of-funds basis.
    (3) NASA funding may not be used for subcontracted foreign research 
efforts. The direct purchase of supplies and/or services, which do not 
constitute research, from non-U.S. sources by U.S. award recipients is 
permitted.

in the NRA, select proposals for funding. Unlike an RFP containing a 
statement of work or specification to which offerors are to respond, an 
NRA provides for the submission of competitive project ideas, conceived 
by the offerors, in one or more program areas of interest. An NRA shall 
not be used when the requirement is sufficiently defined to specify an 
end product or service.

contracts, and interagency agreements and cost-reimbursement supply 
contracts involving research and development work.
    (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.235-71, 
Key Personnel and Facilities, in contracts when source selection has 
been substantially predicated upon the possession by a given offeror of 
special capabilities, as represented by key personnel or facilities.
    (c) The contracting officer shall ensure that the provision at 
1852.235-72, Instructions for Responding to NASA Research Announcements, 
is inserted in all NRAs. The instructions may be supplemented, but only 
to the minimum extent necessary.
    (d) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.235-73, 
Final Scientific and Technical Reports, in all research and development 
contracts, and in interagency agreements and cost-reimbursement supply 
contracts involving research and development work.
    (1) The contracting officer, after consultation with and concurrence 
of the program or project manager and the center Export Control 
Administrator,

[[Page 233]]

shall insert the clause with its Alternate I when the contract includes 
``fundamental research'' as defined at 22 CFR 120.11(8) and no prior 
review of data, including the final report, produced during the 
performance of the contract is required for export control or national 
security purposes before the contractor may publish, release, or 
otherwise disseminate the data.
    (2) The contracting officer, after consultation with and concurrence 
by the program or project manager and where necessary the center Export 
Control Administrator, shall insert the clause with its Alternate II, 
when prior review of all data produced during the performance of the 
contract is required before the contractor may publish, release, or 
otherwise disseminate the data. For example, when data produced during 
performance of the contract may be subject to export control, national 
security restrictions, or other restrictions designated by NASA; or, to 
the extent the contractor receives or is given access to data that 
includes restrictive markings, may include proprietary information of 
others.
    (3) Except when Alternate II applies in accordance with paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section, the contracting officer shall insert the clause 
with its Alternate III in all SBIR and STTR contracts.
    (e) The contracting officer shall insert a clause substantially the 
same as the clause at 1852.235-74, Additional Reports of Work--Research 
and Development, in all research and development contracts, and in 
interagency agreements and cost-reimbursement supply contracts involving 
research and development work, when periodic reports, such as monthly or 
quarterly reports, or reports on the completion of significant units or 
phases of work are required for monitoring contract performance. The 
clause should be modified to reflect the reporting requirements of the 
contract and to indicate the timeframe for submission of the final 
report.

    (a) It is NASA's policy not to require pension portability in 
service contracts. However, pension portability requirements may be 
included in solicitations, contracts, or contract modifications for 
additional work under the following conditions:
    (1)(i) There is a continuing need for the same or similar services 
for a minimum of five years (inclusive of options), and, if the 
contractor changes, a high percentage of the predecessor contractor's 
employees are expected to remain with the program; or
    (ii) The employees under a predecessor contract were covered by a 
portable pension plan, a follow-on contract or a contract consolidating 
existing services is awarded, and the total contract period covered by 
the plan covers a minimum of five years (including both the predecessor 
and successor contracts); and
    (2) The procurement officer determines in writing, with full 
supporting rationale, that such a requirement is in the Government's 
best interest. The procurement officer shall maintain a record of all 
such determinations.
    (b) When pension portability is required, the plan shall comply with 
the requirements of the clause at 1852.237-71, Pension Portability, (see 
1837.110-70(b)), and the contract shall also include a clear description 
of the plan, including service, pay, liabilities, vesting, termination, 
and benefits from prior contracts.

<R05>
Sec. 1837.203-70  Providing contractors access to sensitive information.

    (a)(1) As used in this subpart, ``sensitive information'' refers to 
information that the contractor has developed at private expense or that 
the Government has generated that qualifies for an exception to the 
Freedom of Information Act, which is not currently in the public domain, 
may embody trade secrets or commercial or financial information, and may 
be sensitive or privileged, the disclosure of which is likely to have 
either of the following effects: To impair the Government's ability to 
obtain this type of information in the future; or to cause substantial 
harm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information 
was obtained. The term is not intended to resemble the markings of 
national security documents as in sensitive-secret-top secret.
    (2) As used in this subpart, ``requiring organization'' refers to 
the NASA organizational element or activity that requires specified 
services to be provided.
    (3) As used in this subpart, ``service provider'' refers to the 
service contractor that receives sensitive information from NASA to 
provide services to the requiring organization. (b)(1) To support 
management activities and administrative functions, NASA relies on 
numerous service providers. These contractors may require access to 
sensitive information in the Government's possession, which may be 
entitled to protection from unauthorized use or disclosure.
    (2) As an initial step, the requiring organization shall identify 
when needed services may entail access to sensitive information and 
shall determine whether providing access is necessary for accomplishing 
the Agency's mission. The requiring organization shall review any 
service provider requests for access to information to determine whether 
the access is necessary and whether the information requested is 
considered ``sensitive'' as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (c) When the requiring organization determines that providing 
specified services will entail access to sensitive information, the 
solicitation shall require each potential service provider to submit 
with its proposal a preliminary analysis of possible organizational 
conflicts of interest that might flow from the award of a contract. 
After selection, or whenever it becomes clear that performance will 
necessitate access to sensitive information, the service provider must 
submit a comprehensive organizational conflicts of interest avoidance 
plan.
    (d) This comprehensive plan shall incorporate any previous studies 
performed, shall thoroughly analyze all organizational conflicts of 
interest that might arise because the service provider has access to 
other companies' sensitive information, and shall establish specific 
methods to control, mitigate, or eliminate all problems identified. The 
contracting officer, with advice from Center counsel, shall review the 
plan for completeness and identify to the service provider substantive 
weaknesses and omissions for necessary correction. Once the service 
provider has corrected the substantive weaknesses and omissions, the 
contracting officer shall incorporate the revised plan into the 
contract, as a compliance document.
    (e) If the service provider will be operating an information 
technology system for NASA that contains sensitive information, the 
operating contract shall include the clause at 1852.204-76, Security 
Requirements for Unclassified Information Technology Resources, which 
requires the implementation of an Information Technology Security Plan 
to protect information processed, stored, or transmitted from 
unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or use.
    (f) NASA will monitor performance to assure any service provider 
that requires access to sensitive information follows the steps outlined 
in the clause

information from unauthorized use or disclosure.

Information, offerors and contractors agree that NASA may release their 
sensitive information when requested by service providers in accordance 
with the procedures prescribed in 1837.203-70 and subject to the 
safeguards and protections delineated in the clause at 1852.237-72, 
Access to Sensitive Information. As required by the clause at 1852.237-
73, or other contract clause or solicitation provision, contractors must 
identify information they claim to be ``sensitive'' submitted as part of 
a proposal or in the course of performing a contract. The contracting 
officer shall evaluate all contractor claims of sensitivity in deciding 
how NASA should respond to requests from service providers for access to 
information.

                     Subpart 1843.71_Shared Savings


<R05>
Sec. 1843.7101  Shared Savings Program.

    This subpart establishes and describes the methods for implementing 
and administering a Shared Savings Program. This program provides an 
incentive for contractors to propose and implement, with NASA approval, 
significant cost reduction initiatives. NASA will benefit as the more 
efficient business practices that are implemented lead to reduced costs 
on current and follow-on contracts. In return, contractors are entitled 
to share in cost savings subject to limits established in the contract. 
The contracting officer may require the contractor to provide periodic 
reporting, or other justification, or to require other steps (e.g., cost 
segregation) to ensure projected cost savings are being realized.


<R05>
Sec. 1843.7102  Solicitation provision and contract clause.

    The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.243-71, 
Shared Savings, in all solicitations and contracts expected to exceed 
$1,000,000, except those awarded under FAR part 12, NRA and AO 
procedures, or the SBIR and STTR programs.

<R05>
Sec. 1845.106-70  NASA contract clauses and solicitation provision.

    (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.245-70, 
Contractor Requests for Government-Owned Equipment, in all solicitations 
and contracts that have the potential for contractor acquisition of 
equipment for the account of the Government that is not listed as a 
specific contract deliverable. See 1845.7102 for instructions on 
preparing DD Form 1419.
    (b)(1) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.245-
71, Installation-Accountable Government Property, in solicitations and 
contracts when Government property is to be made available to a 
contractor working on a NASA installation, and the Government will 
maintain accountability for the property. The contracting officer shall 
list in the clause the applicable property user responsibilities. For 
purposes of this clause, NASA installations include local off-site 
buildings owned or directly leased by NASA when the contractor does not 
have authority to acquire property for the account of the Government.

[[Page 242]]

    (2) Use of this clause is subject to the SEMO's concurrence that 
adequate installation property management resources are available for 
oversight of the property in accordance with all applicable NASA 
installation property management directives.
    (3) The contracting officer shall identify in the contract the 
nature, quantity, and acquisition cost of such property and make the 
property available on a no-charge basis.
    (4) The contracting officer shall use the clause with its Alternate 
I if the SEMO requests that the contractor be restricted from use of the 
center central receiving facility for the purposes of receiving 
contractor-acquired property.
    (5) Contracting officers shall list separately in the contract any 
property provided under a FAR 52.245 Government property clause that 
remains accountable to the contractor during its use on the contract 
(such as property used at the contractor's or a subcontractor's off-site 
facility) and which is not also subject to the clause at 1852.245-71. 
The contracting officer shall address any specific maintenance 
considerations (e.g., requiring or precluding use of an installation 
calibration or repair facility) elsewhere in the contract.
    (6) See 1845.106-70(e).
    (c) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.245-72, 
Liability for Government Property Furnished for Repair and Services, in 
fixed-price solicitations and contracts (except for experimental, 
developmental, or research work with educational or nonprofit 
institutions, where no profit is contemplated) for repair, modification, 
rehabilitation, or other servicing of Government property, if such 
property is to be furnished to a contractor for that purpose and no 
other Government property is to be furnished. The contracting officer 
shall not require additional insurance under the clause unless the 
circumstances clearly indicate advantages to the Government.
    (d) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.245-73, 
Financial Reporting of NASA Property in the Custody of Contractors, in 
cost reimbursement contracts unless all property to be provided is 
subject to the clause at 1852.245-71, Installation-Accountable 
Government Property. The clause shall also be included in other types of 
contracts when it is known at award that property will be provided to 
the contractor or that the contractor will acquire property title to 
which will vest in the Government prior to delivery.
    (e) When approved by the Logistics Management Division of the 
Headquarters Office of Infrastructure and Management (Code OJG), the 
contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.245-74, Contractor 
Accountable On-Site Government Property, in lieu of the clause at 
1852.245-71, in solicitations and contracts when accountability rests 
with an on-site contractor. The contracting officer's written request 
for approval shall include a determination of costs that will be (1) 
avoided (e.g., additional costs to the installation's property 
management systems and staffing) and (2) incurred (e.g., reimbursable 
costs of the contractor to implement, staff, and operate separate 
property management systems on-site, and resources needed for 
performance of, or reimbursement for, property administration) under 
contractor accountability.
    (f) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.245-75, 
Title to Equipment, in solicitations and contracts where the clause at 
FAR 52.245-2 with its Alternate II or 52.245-5, with its Alternate I is 
used.
    (g) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.245-76, 
List of Government-Furnished Property, in solicitations and contracts if 
the contractor is to be accountable under the contract for Government 
property.
    (h) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.245-77, 
List of Installation-Accountable Property and Services, in solicitations 
and contracts that require performance at the center and authorize 
contractor use of property within the physical borders of the center.
    (1) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 1852.245-
79, Use of Government-Owned Property, in all solicitations when 
Government property may be used by the contractor.
    (j) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.245-80, 
Use of

[[Page 243]]

Government Production and Research Property on a No-Charge Basis, in 
solicitations and contracts when government property (real property, 
commercially available equipment, special test equipment, or special 
tooling) accountable under another contract(s) is authorized for use.

                    Subpart 1845.71_Forms Preparation


<R05>
Sec. 1845.7101  Instructions for preparing NASA Form 1018.

    NASA must account for and report assets in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 
3512 and 31 U.S.C. 3515, Federal Accounting Standards, and Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) instructions. Since contractors maintain 
NASA's official records for its assets in their possession, NASA must 
obtain periodic data from those records to meet these requirements. 
Changes in Federal Accounting Standards and OMB reporting requirements 
may occur from year to year, requiring contractor submission of 
supplemental information with the NASA Form (NF) 1018. The specific 
Statements of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) to be used 
for property records are SFFAS No. 3 ``Accounting for Inventory and 
Related Property'', SFFAS No. 6 ``Accounting for Property, Plant and 
Equipment'', SFFAS No. 10 ``Accounting for Internal Use Software'', and 
SFFAS No. 11 ``Amendments to PP&E: Definitions'' issued by the Federal 
Accounting Standards Advisory Board. Classifications of property, 
related costs to be reported, and other reporting requirements are 
discussed in this subpart. NF 1018 (see 1853.3) provides critical 
information for NASA financial statements and property management. 
Accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the report are critical to 
many aspects of NASA's operations.

[68 FR 62024, Oct. 31, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 1845.7101-1  Property classification.

    (a) General. (1) Contractors shall report costs in the 
classifications on NF 1018, as described in this section. The cost of 
heritage assets and obsolete property will be reported on the NF 1018 
under the appropriate classification. Supplemental reporting may also be 
required.
    (2)(i) Heritage assets are property, plant and equipment that 
possess one or more of the following characteristics:
    (A) Historical or natural significance;
    (B) Cultural, educational or artistic importance; or
    (C) Significant architectural characteristics.
    (ii) Examples of NASA heritage assets include buildings and 
structures designated as National Historic Landmarks as well as 
aircraft, spacecraft and related components on display to enhance public 
understanding of NASA programs. Heritage assets which serve both a 
heritage and government operation function are considered multi-use when 
the predominant use is in general government operations. Multi-use 
heritage assets will not be considered heritage assets for NF 1018 
supplemental reporting purposes.
    (3) Obsolete property is property for which there are no current 
plans for use in its intended purpose (i.e., it no longer provides 
service to NASA operations). Examples of obsolete property are items in 
configurations which are no longer required or used by NASA or items 
held for engineering evaluation purposes only. NASA may have approved 
the retention of these items for programmatic reasons even though they 
have no current plans for use.
    (b) Land. Includes costs of land and improvements to land. 
Contractors shall report land with a unit acquisition cost of $100,000 
or more.
    (c) Buildings. Includes costs of buildings, improvements to 
buildings, and fixed equipment required for the operation of a building 
which is permanently attached to and a part of the building and cannot 
be removed without cutting into the walls, ceilings, of floors. 
Contractors shall report buildings with a unit acquisition cost of 
$100,000 or more. Examples of fixed equipment required for functioning 
of a building include plumbing, heating and lighting equipment, 
elevators, central air conditioning systems, and built-in safes and 
vaults.
    (d) Other Structures and Facilities. Includes costs of acquisitions 
and improvements of real property (i.e. structures and facilities other 
than buildings); for example, airfield pavements, harbor and port 
facilities, power production facilities and distribution systems, 
reclamation and irrigation facilities, flood control and navigation 
aids, utility systems (heating, sewage, water

[[Page 246]]

and electrical) when they serve several buildings or structures, 
communication systems, traffic aids, roads and bridges, railroads, 
monuments and memorials, and nonstructural improvements such as 
sidewalks, parking areas, and fences. Contractors shall report other 
structures and facilities with a unit acquisition cost of $100,000 or 
more and a useful life of two years or more.
    (e) Leasehold improvements. Includes NASA-funded costs of 
improvements to leased buildings, structures, and facilities, as well as 
easements and right-of-way, where NASA is the lessee or the cost is 
charged to a NASA contract. Contractors shall report leasehold 
improvements with a unit acquisition cost of $100,000 or more and a 
useful life of two years or more.
    (f) Construction in progress. Includes costs of work in process for 
the construction of Buildings, Other Structures and Facilities, and 
Leasehold Improvements to which NASA has title, regardless of value.
    (g) Equipment. Includes costs of commercially available personal 
property capable of stand-alone use in manufacturing supplies, 
performing services, or any general or administrative purpose (for 
example, machine tools, furniture, vehicles, computers, software, test 
equipment, including their accessory or auxiliary items). Software 
integrated into and necessary to operate another item of Government 
property is considered to be an auxiliary item (see FAR 45.501) and 
should be considered part of the item of which it is an integral part. 
Other software to which NASA has title shall be classified as an 
individual item of equipment for reporting purposes if it has a useful 
life of 2 years or more and acquisition cost of $1,000,000 or more (also 
see 1845.7101-3(g)). Enhancement costs for existing software should be 
added to the software acquisition cost if the enhancement results in 
significant additional capability beyond that for which the software was 
originally developed (i.e., a capability that was not included in the 
original software specifications, the total cost of the enhancement is 
$1,000,000 or more, or the expected useful life of the enhanced software 
is 2 years or more). Software licenses are excluded. Contractors shall 
separately report:
    (1) The amount for all items with a unit acquisition cost of 
$100,000 or more and a useful life of two years or more; and
    (2) All other items.
    (h) Special tooling. Includes costs of equipment and manufacturing 
aids (and their components and replacements) of such a specialized 
nature that, without substantial modification or alteration, their use 
is limited to development or production of particular supplies or parts, 
or performance of particular services (see FAR 45.101). Examples include 
jigs, dies, fixtures, molds, patterns, taps and gauges. Contractors 
shall separately report:
    (1) The amount for all items with a unit acquisition cost of 
$100,000 or more and a useful life of two years or more; and
    (2) All other items.
    (i) Special test equipment. Includes costs of equipment used to 
accomplish special purpose testing in performing a contract, and items 
or assemblies of equipment (see FAR 45.101). Contractors shall 
separately report:
    (1) The amount for all items with a unit acquisition cost of 
$100,000 or more and a useful life of two years or more; and
    (2) All other items.
    (j) Material. Includes costs of NASA-owned property held in 
inventory regardless of whether or not it is unique to NASA programs, 
that may become a part of an end item or be expended in performing a 
contract. Examples include raw and processed material, spares, parts, 
assemblies, small tools and supplies. Material that is part of work-in-
process is not included. Contractors shall report the amount for all 
Materials in inventory, regardless of unit acquisition cost.
    (k) Agency-Peculiar Property. Includes costs of completed items, 
unique to NASA aeronautical and space programs, which are capable of 
stand-alone operation. Examples include research aircraft, reusable 
space vehicles, ground support equipment, prototypes, and mock-ups. The 
amount of property, title to which vests in NASA as a result of progress 
payments to

[[Page 247]]

fixed price subcontractors, shall be included to reflect the pro rata 
cost of undelivered agency-peculiar property. Completed end items not 
related to the International Space Station or the Space Shuttle program 
which otherwise meet the definition of Agency-Peculiar Property, and are 
destined for permanent operation in space, such as satellites and space 
probes, shall not be reported. Contractors shall separately report:
    (1) The amount for all items with a unit acquisition cost of 
$100,000 or more and a useful life of two years or more; and
    (2) All other items.
    (l) Contract Work-in-Process. Work-in-process (WIP) consists of 
property items under construction (i.e., not complete). It includes 
costs of all work-in-process regardless of value, and excludes costs of 
completed items reported in other categories. While the costs of WIP for 
International Space Station and Space Shuttle components should be 
included as WIP, satellites and space probes and their components should 
be excluded from WIP as those items will be accounted for by NASA.

<R05>
Sec. 1845.7101-2  Transfers of property.

    A transfer is a change in accountability between and among prime 
contracts, NASA Centers, and other Government agencies (e.g., between 
contracts of the same NASA Center, contracts of different NASA Centers, 
a contract of one NASA Center to another, a NASA Center to a contract of 
another NASA Center, and a contract to another Government agency or its 
contract). To enable NASA to properly control and account for all 
transfers, they shall be adequately documented. Adequate documentation 
includes the appropriate dollar amount of the asset(s) transferred (as 
prescribed in 1845.7101-3) and the formal, signed NASA or contractor 
authorization approving the transfer. In addition, procurement, 
property, and financial organizations at NASA Centers must effect all 
transfers of accountability, although physical shipment and receipt of 
property may be made directly by contractors. The procedures described 
in this section shall be followed to provide an administrative and audit 
trail, even if property is physically shipped directly from one 
contractor to another. Property shipped between September 1 and 
September 30, inclusively, shall be accounted for and reported by the 
shipping contractor, regardless of the method of shipment, unless 
written evidence of receipt at destination has been received. 
Repairables provided under fixed price repair contracts that include the 
clause at 1852.245-72, Liability for Government Property Furnished for 
Repair or Other Services, remain accountable to the cognizant NASA 
Center and are not reportable on NF 1018; repairables provided under a 
cost-reimbursement contract, however, are accountable to the contractor 
and reportable on NF 1018. All materials provided to conduct repairs are 
reportable, regardless of contract type.
    (a) Approval and notification. The contractor must obtain approval 
of the contracting officer or designee for transfers of property off the 
prime contract before shipment. Each shipping document must be signed by 
the contracting officer or designee demonstrating such approval. Each 
shipping document must contain contract numbers, shipping references, 
property classifications in which the items are recorded (including 
Federal Supply Classification group (FSC) codes for equipment), unit 
acquisition costs (as defined in 1845.7101-3, Unit Acquisition Cost), 
original Government acquisition dates for items with a unit acquisition 
cost of $100,000 or more and a useful life of two years or more, and any 
other appropriate identifying or descriptive data. Where the DD Form 
250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, is used, the FSC code 
will be part of the national stock number (NSN) entered in Block 16 or, 
if the NSN is not provided, the FSC alone shall be shown in Block 16. 
The original Government acquisition date shall be shown in Block 23, by 
item. Other formats, such as the DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/
Shipping Document, should be clearly

[[Page 248]]

annotated with the required information. Unit acquisition costs shall be 
obtained from records maintained pursuant to FAR Part 45 and this Part 
1845, or, for uncompleted items where property records have not yet been 
established, from such other record systems as are appropriate such as 
manufacturing or engineering records used for work control and billing 
purposes. Shipping contractors shall furnish a copy of the formally 
approved shipping document to the cognizant property administrator. 
Shipping and receiving contractors shall promptly submit copies of 
shipping and receiving documents to the Center Deputy Chief Financial 
Officer, Finance, responsible for their respective contracts when 
accountability for NASA property is transferred to, or received from, 
other contracts, contractors, NASA Centers, or Government agencies.
    (b) Reclassification. If property is transferred to another contract 
or contractor, the receiving contractor shall record the property in the 
same property classification and amount appearing on the shipping 
document. For example, when a contractor receives an item from another 
contractor that is identified on the shipping document as equipment, but 
that the recipient intends to incorporate into special test equipment, 
the recipient shall first record the item in the equipment account and 
subsequently reclassify it as special test equipment. Reclassification 
of equipment, special tooling, special test equipment, or agency-
peculiar property requires prior approval of the contracting officer or 
a designee.
    (c) Incomplete documentation. If contractors receive transfer 
documents having insufficient detail to properly record the transfer 
(e.g., omission of property classification, FSC, unit acquisition cost, 
Government acquisition date, required signatures, etc.) they shall 
request the omitted data directly from the shipping contractor or 
through the property administrator as provided in FAR 45.505-2. The 
contracting officer shall assist the Government Property Administrator 
and the receiving contractor to obtain all required information for the 
receiving contractor to establish adequate property records.

<R05>
Sec. 1845.7101-3  Unit acquisition cost.

    (a) The unit acquisition cost shall include all costs incurred to 
bring the property to a form and location suitable for its intended use. 
The following is representative of the types of costs that shall be 
included, when applicable:
    (1) Amounts paid to vendors or other contractors.
    (2) Transportation charges to the point of initial use.
    (3) Handling and storage charges.
    (4) Labor and other direct or indirect production costs (for assets 
produced or constructed).
    (5) Engineering, architectural, and other outside services for 
designs, plans, specifications, and surveys.
    (6) Acquisition and preparation costs of buildings and other 
facilities.
    (7) An appropriate share of the cost of the equipment and facilities 
used in construction work.
    (8) Fixed equipment and related installation costs required for 
activities in a building or facility.
    (9) Direct costs of inspection, supervision, and administration of 
construction contracts and construction work.
    (10) Legal and recording fees and damage claims.
    (11) Fair values of facilities and equipment donated to the 
Government.
    (b) Acquisition cost shall include, where appropriate, for 
contractor acquired property, related fees, or a pro rata portion of 
fees, paid by NASA to the contractor. Situations where inclusion of fees 
in the acquisition cost would be appropriate are those in which the 
contractor designs, develops, fabricates or purchases property for NASA 
and part of the fees paid to the contractor by NASA are related to that 
effort.
    (c) Acquisition cost shall be developed using actual costs to the 
greatest extent possible, especially costs directly related to 
fabrication such as labor and materials. Where estimates are used, there 
must be a documented methodology based on a historical basis. All 
acquisition costs shall be

[[Page 249]]

properly documented, supported and retained. Supporting documentation 
shall be made available upon request.
    (d) The use of weighted average methodologies is acceptable for 
valuation of Material.
    (e) Contractors shall report unit acquisition costs using records 
that are part of the prescribed property or financial control system as 
provided in this section. Fabrication costs shall be based on approved 
systems or procedures and include all direct and indirect costs of 
fabrication.
    (f) Only modifications that improve an item's capacity or extend its 
useful life two years or more and that cost $100,000 or more shall be 
reported on the NF 1018 on the $100,000 & Over line. The costs of any 
other modifications, excluding routine maintenance, will be reported on 
the Under $100,000 line. If an item's original unit acquisition cost is 
less than $100,000, but a single subsequent modification costs $100,000 
or more, that modification only will be reported as an item $100,000 or 
more on subsequent NF 1018s. The original acquisition cost of the item 
will continue to be included in the under $100,000 total. The quantity 
for the modified item will remain ``1'' and be reported with the 
original acquisition cost of the item. If an item's acquisition cost is 
reduced by removal of components so that its remaining acquisition cost 
is under $100,000, it shall be reported as under $100,000.
    (g) Software acquisition costs include software costs incurred up 
through acceptance testing and material internal costs incurred to 
implement the software and otherwise make the software ready for use. 
Costs incurred after acceptance testing are excluded. License, 
maintenance, training, and data conversion costs are also excluded. If 
the software is purchased as part of a package, the costs will need to 
be segregated in such manner as to ensure that the excluded costs 
(maintenance, training, etc.) are not reported as part of the software's 
acquisition cost. Enhancement costs for existing software should be 
added to the acquisition cost if the enhancement results in significant 
additional capability beyond that for which the software was originally 
developed (i.e. a capability that was not included in the original 
software specifications), the total cost of the enhancement is 
$1,000,000 or more, and the expected useful life of the enhanced 
software is 2 years or more. Include the same types of cost as indicated 
above under new software. Costs incurred solely to repair a design flaw 
or perform minor upgrades should not be included.
    (h) The computation of work in process (WIP) shall include all 
direct and indirect costs of fabrication, including associated systems, 
subsystems, and spare parts and components furnished or acquired and 
charged to work in process pending incorporation into a finished item. 
These types of items make up what is sometimes called production 
inventory and include programmed extra units to cover replacement during 
the fabrication process (production spares). Also included are 
deliverable items on which the contractor or a subcontractor has begun 
work, and materials issued from inventory. The computation of WIP shall 
incorporate the other requirements for unit acquisition cost as outlined 
in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section. In addition, acquisition 
cost of property furnished by the Government, which has been 
incorporated in the property item under construction or in process of 
fabrication, should be included. Do not include costs for operation or 
repairing existing completed property items. Once the property is 
complete, include all the costs outlined above in its acquisition value 
in the property record. The WIP values are inception to date until such 
time as the WIP is completed. It does not include future costs.

Sec. 1845.7101-4  Types of deletions from contractor property records.

    Contractors shall report the types of deletions from contract 
property records as described in this section.
    (a) Lost, damaged or destroyed. Deletion amounts that result from 
relief from responsibility under FAR 45.503 granted during the reporting 
period.
    (b) Transferred in Place. Deletion amounts that result from transfer 
of

[[Page 250]]

property to a follow-on prime contract or other prime contract with the 
same contractor.
    (c) Transferred to NASA Center accountability. Deletion amounts that 
result from transfer of accountability to the NASA Center responsible 
for the contract, whether or not items are physically moved.
    (d) Transferred to another NASA Center. Deletion amounts that result 
from transfer of accountability to a NASA Center other than the one 
responsible for the contract, whether or not items are physically moved.
    (e) Transferred to another Government agency. Deletion amounts that 
result from transfer of property to another Government agency.
    (f) Purchased at cost/returned for credit. Deletion amounts that 
result from contractor purchase or retention of contractor acquired 
property as provided in FAR 45.605-1, or from contractor returns to 
suppliers under FAR 45.605-2.
    (g) Disposed of through plant clearance process. Deletions other 
than transfers within the Federal Government, e.g., donations to 
eligible recipients, sold at less than cost, or abandoned/directed 
destruction, or trade-ins.
    (h) Other. Types of deletion other than those reported in paragraph 
(a) through (g) of this section such as those resulting from 
reclassifications (e.g. from equipment to agency-peculiar property).

Sec. 1845.7102  Instructions for preparing DD Form 1419.

    (a) The contractor shall enter the essential information covering 
Sections I and II before submission of DD Form 1419, DOD Industrial 
Plant Equipment Requisition, to the Industrial Property Officer (IPO). 
The IPO shall review each submission for completeness and authenticity. 
Incomplete or invalid requests shall be returned for correction.
    (b) When a suitable item is allocated in Section IV, inspection of 
the equipment is recommended. Notification of acceptance or rejection of 
the item offered must reach NASA within 30 days after allocation. A copy 
of the DD Form 1419, or equivalent format, will serve as the clearance 
document to inspect the equipment at the storage site. Note acceptance 
or rejection of the item, without inspection or after inspection in 
Section VI. If the item is acceptable, execute Section VII. Cite the 
NASA appropriation symbol where applicable in Section VII.
    (c) The IPO shall assign a requisition number to each DD Form 1419, 
or equivalent format request.
    (d) Next will be a four-digit entry comprised of the last digit of 
the current calendar year and the Julian date of the year. For example, 
April 15, 1997, would be written as 7095 (April 15 being the 95th day of 
the year). The last entry will be a four-digit number from 0001 to 9999 
to sequentially number requisition forms prepared on the same date. For 
example, the ninth requisition prepared on April 15, 1997, would be 
7095-0009, preceded by the FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP Activity Address Code. When 
submitting subsequent DD Forms 1419, or equivalent format, related to 
the item requested, the IPO shall use the same requisition number and 
add the alpha code to the end of the requisition number to indicate a 
second or third action on the basic request. Alpha ``A'' would indicate 
a second request, ``B'' a third, etc. In this manner, all actions, 
correspondence, etc., relative to a given request can be identified at 
all levels of processing by the use of the requisition number.
    (e) Detailed directions for completing the DD Form 1419 follow. The

officer, legal counsel, or other technician will be secured. When the 
contractor acknowledges liability, the property administrator shall 
forward a copy of the credit memorandum or other adjusting document to 
the administrative contracting officer and auditor, if appropriate, to 
assure proper credit. If analysis of contract provisions and 
circumstances establishes that the loss, damage, destruction, or 
consumption constitutes a risk assumed by the Government, the property 
administrator shall so advise the contractor in writing, thereby 
relieving the contractor of responsibility for the property. A copy of 
the documentation and notification to the contractor shall be retained

Sec. 1851.102-70  Contractor acquisition of filing cabinets.

    (a) The Contractor officer must approve any planned contractor 
acquisition of filing cabinets whose title will vest in the Government. 
The contracting officer shall ensure that the contractor takes the 
following actions before submitting a request for approval:
    (1) Transfer inactive records to contractor storage areas;
    (2) Dispose of unnecessary records in accordance with corporate 
procedures;
    (3) Use less expensive shelf filing methods; and
    (4) Take other actions to reduce the need for filing cabinets.
    (b) If after taking the actions in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of 
this section, the contractor requires additional filing capacity, it 
shall submit for contracting officer approval a request to order filing 
cabinets. This request shall include a discussion of why sufficient 
additional filing capacity is necessary and shall address the results of 
the actions in paragraphs (a) (1) through (4) of this section. The 
contracting officer shall review the request in consultation with the 
Records Management Officer, the Property and Supply Officer, and the 
project officer, is appropriate.

Sec. 1852.204-76  Security Requirements for Unclassified Information 
          Technology Resources.

    As prescribed in 1804.470-4, insert a clause substantially as 
follows:

Security Requirements for Unclassified Information Technology Resources, 
                               (NOV 2004)

    (a) The Contractor shall be responsible for Information Technology 
security for all systems connected to a NASA network or operated by the 
Contractor for NASA, regardless of location. This clause is applicable 
to all or any part of the contract that includes information technology 
resources or services in which the Contractor must have physical or 
electronic access to NASA's sensitive information contained in 
unclassified systems that directly support the mission of the Agency. 
This includes information technology, hardware, software, and the 
management, operation, maintenance, programming, and system 
administration of computer systems, networks, and telecommunications 
systems. Examples of tasks that require security provisions include:
    (1) Computer control of spacecraft, satellites, or aircraft or their 
payloads;
    (2) Acquisition, transmission or analysis of data owned by NASA with 
significant replacement cost should the contractor's copy be corrupted; 
and
    (3) Access to NASA networks or computers at a level beyond that 
granted the general public, e.g. bypassing a firewall.
    (b) The Contractor shall provide, implement, and maintain an IT 
Security Plan. This plan shall describe the processes and procedures 
that will be followed to ensure appropriate security of IT resources 
that are developed, processed, or used under this contract. The plan 
shall describe those parts of the contract to which this clause applies. 
The Contractor's IT Security Plan shall be compliant with Federal laws 
that include, but are not limited to, the Computer Security Act of 1987 
(40 U.S.C. 1441 et seq.) and the Government Information Security Reform 
Act of 2000. The plan shall meet IT security requirements in accordance 
with Federal and NASA policies and procedures that include, but are not 
limited to:
    (1) OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, 
Appendix III, Security of Federal Automated Information Resources;
    (2) NASA Procedures and Guidelines (NPR) 2810.1, Security of 
Information Technology; and
    (3) Chapter 3 of NPR 1620.1, NASA Security Procedural Requirements.
    (c) Within ----days after contract award, the contractor shall 
submit for NASA approval an IT Security Plan. This plan must be 
consistent with and further detail the approach contained in the 
offeror's proposal or sealed bid that resulted in the award of this 
contract and in compliance with the requirements stated in this clause. 
The plan, as approved by the Contracting Officer, shall be incorporated 
into the contract as a compliance document.
    (d)(1) Contractor personnel requiring privileged access or limited 
privileged access to systems operated by the Contractor for NASA or 
interconnected to a NASA network shall be screened at an appropriate 
level in accordance with NPR 2810.1, Section 4.5; NPR 1620.1, Chapter 3; 
and paragraph (d)(2) of this clause. Those Contractor personnel with 
non-privileged access do not require personnel screening. NASA shall 
provide screening using standard personnel screening National Agency 
Check (NAC) forms listed in paragraph (d)(3) of this clause, unless 
contractor screening in accordance with paragraph (d)(4) is approved. 
The Contractor shall submit the required forms to the NASA Center Chief 
of Security (CCS) within fourteen (14) days after contract award or 
assignment of an individual to a position requiring screening. The forms 
may be obtained from the CCS. At the option of the government, interim 
access may be granted pending completion of the NAC.
    (2) Guidance for selecting the appropriate level of screening is 
based on the risk of adverse impact to NASA missions. NASA defines three 
levels of risk for which screening

[[Page 265]]

is required (IT-1 has the highest level of risk):
    (i) IT-1--Individuals having privileged access or limited privileged 
access to systems whose misuse can cause very serious adverse impact to 
NASA missions. These systems include, for example, those that can 
transmit commands directly modifying the behavior of spacecraft, 
satellites or aircraft.
    (ii) IT-2--Individuals having privileged access or limited 
privileged access to systems whose misuse can cause serious adverse 
impact to NASA missions. These systems include, for example, those that 
can transmit commands directly modifying the behavior of payloads on 
spacecraft, satellites or aircraft; and those that contain the primary 
copy of ``level 1'' data whose cost to replace exceeds one million 
dollars.
    (iii) IT-3--Individuals having privileged access or limited 
privileged access to systems whose misuse can cause significant adverse 
impact to NASA missions. These systems include, for example, those that 
interconnect with a NASA network in a way that exceeds access by the 
general public, such as bypassing firewalls; and systems operated by the 
contractor for NASA whose function or data has substantial cost to 
replace, even if these systems are not interconnected with a NASA 
network.
    (3) Screening for individuals shall employ forms appropriate for the 
level of risk as follows:
    (i) IT-1: Fingerprint Card (FC) 258 and Standard Form (SF) 85P, 
Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions;
    (ii) IT-2: FC 258 and SF 85, Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive 
Positions; and
    (iii) IT-3: NASA Form 531, Name Check, and FC 258.
    (4) The Contracting Officer may allow the Contractor to conduct its 
own screening of individuals requiring privileged access or limited 
privileged access provided the Contractor can demonstrate that the 
procedures used by the Contractor are equivalent to NASA's personnel 
screening procedures. As used here, equivalent includes a check for 
criminal history, as would be conducted by NASA, and completion of a 
questionnaire covering the same information as would be required by 
NASA.
    (5) Screening of contractor personnel may be waived by the 
Contracting Officer for those individuals who have proof of--
    (1) Current or recent national security clearances (within last 
three years);
    (ii) Screening conducted by NASA within last three years; or
    (iii) Screening conducted by the Contractor, within last three 
years, that is equivalent to the NASA personnel screening procedures as 
approved by the Contracting Officer under paragraph (d)(4) of this 
clause.
    (e) The Contractor shall ensure that its employees, in performance 
of the contract, receive annual IT security training in NASA IT Security 
policies, procedures, computer ethics, and best practices in accordance 
with NPR 2810.1, Section 4.3 requirements. The contractor may use web-
based training available from NASA to meet this requirement.
    (f) The Contractor shall afford NASA, including the Office of 
Inspector General, access to the Contractor's and subcontractors' 
facilities, installations, operations, documentation, databases and 
personnel used in performance of the contract. Access shall be provided 
to the extent required to carry out a program of IT inspection, 
investigation and audit to safeguard against threats and hazards to the 
integrity, availability and confidentiality of NASA data or to the 
function of computer systems operated on behalf of NASA, and to preserve 
evidence of computer crime.
    (g) The Contractor shall incorporate the substance of this clause in 
all subcontracts that meet the conditions in paragraph (a) of this 
clause.

Sec. 1852.208-81  Restrictions on Printing and Duplicating.

    As prescribed in 1808.870, insert the following clause:

           Restrictions on Printing and Duplicating (NOV 2004)

    (a) The Contractor may duplicate or copy any documentation required 
by this contract in accordance with the provisions of the Government 
Printing and Binding Regulations, No. 26, S. Pub 101-9, U.S. Government 
Printing Office, Washington, DC, 20402, published by the Joint Committee 
on Printing, U.S. Congress.
    (b) The Contractor shall not perform, or procure from any commercial 
source, any printing in connection with the performance of work under 
this contract. The term ``printing'' includes the processes of 
composition, platemaking, presswork, duplicating, silk screen processes, 
binding, microform, and the end items of such processes and equipment.
    (c) The Contractor is authorized to duplicate or copy production 
units provided the requirement does not exceed 5,000 production units of 
any one page or 25,000 units in the aggregate of multiple pages. Such 
pages may not exceed a maximum image size of 10-\3/4\ by 14-\1/4\ 
inches. A ``production unit'' is one sheet, size 8-\1/2\x11 inches 
(215x280 mm), one side only, and one color ink.
    (d) This clause does not preclude writing, editing, preparation of 
manuscript copy, or

[[Page 266]]

preparation of related illustrative material as a part of this contract, 
or administrative duplicating/copying (for example, necessary forms and 
instructional materials used by the Contractor to respond to the terms 
of the contract).
    (e) Costs associated with printing, duplicating, or copying in 
excess of the limits in paragraph (c) of this clause are unallowable 
without prior written approval of the Contracting Officer. If the 
Contractor has reason to believe that any activity required in 
fulfillment of the contract will necessitate any printing or substantial 
duplicating or copying, it immediately shall provide written notice to 
the Contracting Officer and request approval prior to proceeding with 
the activity. Requests will be processed by the Contracting Officer in 
accordance with the provisions of the Government Printing and Binding 
Regulations, NFS 1808.802, and NPR 1490.5, NASA Procedural Requirements 
for Printing, Duplicating, and Copying Management.
    (f) The Contractor shall include in each subcontract which may

give rise to a potential organizational conflict of interest. 
Accordingly, the attention of prospective offerors is invited to FAR 
Subpart 9.5--Organizational Conflicts of Interest.

develop specifications or statements or work that are to be incorporated 
into a solicitation, the Contractor shall be ineligible to perform the 
work described in that solicitation as a prime of first-tier

remain in effect for a reasonable time, as agreed to by the Contracting 
Officer and the Contractor, sufficient to avoid unfair competitive 
advantage or potential bias (this time shall in no case be less than the 
duration of the initial production contract). NASA shall not

statements of work under this contract.
    (2) To the extent that the work under this contract requires access

companies, and as long as these data remain proprietary or confidential, 
the Contractor shall protect these data from unauthorized use and 
disclosure and agrees not to use them to complete with those other 
companies.

                     Brand Name or Equal (DEC 1988)

    (a) As used in this provision, ``brand name'' means identification 
of products by make and model. The term ``bid'' means ``offer'' if this 
is a negotiated acquisition.
    (b) If items called for by this solicitation are identified in the 
Schedule by a ``brand name or equal'' description, that identification 
is intended to be descriptive, not restrictive, and is to indicate the 
quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids 
offering ``equal'' products, including products of the brand name 
manufacturer other than the one described by brand name, will be 
considered for award if the products are clearly identified in the bids 
and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient 
characteristics requirements referenced in the solicitation.
    (c) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in the bid that it is 
offering an ``equal'' product, the bid shall be considered as offering a 
brand-name product referenced in the solicitation.
    (d)(1) If the offeror proposes to furnish an ``equal'' product, the 
brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in 
the space provided in the solicitation, or that product shall be 
otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the 
determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the 
responsibility of the Government and will be based on information 
furnished by the offeror or identified in its bid, as well as on other 
information reasonably available to the contracting activity.
    (2) Caution to Offerors: The contracting office is not responsible 
for locating or securing any information not identified in the bid and 
reasonably available to the contracting office. Accordingly, to ensure 
that sufficient information is available, the offeror must furnish as a 
part of its bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, 
drawings, or other information) necessary for the contracting office to 
(i) determine whether the product offered meets the salient 
characteristics requirements of the solicitation and (ii) establish 
exactly what the offeror proposes to furnish and what the Government 
would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information 
furnished may include specific references to information previously 
furnished or to information otherwise available to the contracting 
office.
    (3) If the offeror proposes to modify a product so as to make it 
conform to the requirements of the solicitation, it shall (i) include in 
the bid a clear description of the proposed modifications and (ii) 
clearly mark any descriptive material to show them.
    (4) If this is a sealed-bid acquisition, modifications proposed 
after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product 
referenced in the solicitation will not be considered.

paragraph to the end of the basic provision and identify appropriately:

    ( ) Representation of Limited Rights Data and Restricted Computer 
Software
    (1) This solicitation sets forth the work to be performed if a 
contract award results, and the Government's known delivery requirements 
for data (as defined in FAR 27.401). Any resulting contract may also 
provide the Government the option to order additional data under the 
Additional Data Requirements clause at FAR 52.227-16, if included in the 
contract. Any data delivered under the resulting contract will be 
subject to the Rights in Data-General clause at FAR 52.227-14 that is to 
be included in this contract. Under the latter clause, a Contractor may 
withhold from delivery data that qualify as limited rights data or 
restricted computer software, and deliver form, fit, and function data 
in lieu thereof. The latter clause also may be used with its Alternates 
II and/or III to obtain delivery of limited rights data or restricted 
computer software, marked with limited rights or restricted rights 
notices, as appropriate. In addition, use of Alternate V with this 
latter clause provides the Government the right to inspect such data at 
the Contractor's facility.
    (2) As an aid in determining the Government's need to include 
Alternate II or Alternate III in the clause at FAR 52.227-14, Rights in 
Data-General, the offeror shall complete paragraph (3) of this provision 
to either state that none of the data qualify as limited rights data or 
restricted computer software, or identify, to the extent feasible, which 
of the data qualifies as limited rights data or restricted computer 
software. Any identification of limited rights data or restricted 
computer software in the offeror's response is not determinative of the 
status of such data should a contract be awarded to the offeror.
    (3) The offeror has reviewed the requirements for the delivery of 
data or software and states [offeror check appropriate block]--
    ( ) None of the data proposed for fulfilling such requirements 
qualifies as limited rights data or restricted computer software.
    ( ) Data proposed for fulfilling such requirements qualify as 
limited rights data or restricted computer software and are identified 
as follows:

nonresponsive any bid that incorporates literature containing such 
language or any bid that must be evaluated by using literature 
containing such language. Bidders should clearly label any submissions 
of descriptive literature not intended to form a part of a bid as such 
in order to preclude any need for the Government to interpret the 
bidder's intent in submitting descriptive literature. [See FAR 14.202-

evaluations will be considered by the Government in its evaluation. The 
Government's Fee Determination Official (FDO) will determine the award 
fee amounts based on the Contractor's performance in accordance with

reserve shall not exceed 15 percent of the total potential award fee.
    (e) The amount of award fee which can be awarded in each evaluation

period cannot be reallocated to future evaluation periods.
    (f)(1) Provisional award fee payments [insert ``will'' or ``will

determination of the amount of fee earned for an evaluation period. If 
applicable, provisional award fee payments will be made to the

    (3) If the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor will 
not achieve a level of performance commensurate with the provisional 
rate, payment of provisional award fee will be discontinued or reduced

    (a) The contractor can earn award fee, or base fee, if any, from a 
minimum of zero dollars to the maximum stated in NASA FAR Supplement 
clause 1852.216-85, ``Estimated Cost and Award Fee'' in this contract. 
All award fee evaluations, with the exception of the last evaluation, 
will be interim evaluations. At the last evaluation, which is final, the 
Contractor's performance for the entire contract will be evaluated to 
determine total earned award fee. No award fee or base fee will be paid 
to the Contractor if the final award fee evaluation is ``poor/
unsatisfactory.''
    (b) Beginning 6* months after the effective date of this contract, 
the Government will evaluate the Contractor's interim performance every 
6* months to monitor Contractor performance prior to contract completion 
and to provide feedback to the Contractor. The evaluation will be 
performed in accordance with [identify performance evaluation plan] to 
this contract. The Contractor may submit a self-evaluation of 
performance for each period under consideration. These self-evaluations 
will be considered by the Government in its evaluation. The Government 
will advise the Contractor in writing of the evaluation results. The 
plan may be revised unilaterally by the Government prior to the 
beginning of any rating period to redirect emphasis.
    (c)(1) Base fee, if applicable, will be paid in [Insert ``monthly'', 
or less frequent period] installments based on the percent of completion 
of the work as determined by the Contracting Officer.
    (2) Interim award fee payments will be made to the Contractor based 
on each interim evaluation. The amount of the interim award fee payment 
is limited to the lesser of the interim evaluation score or 80 percent 
of the fee allocation to that period less any provisional payments made 
during the period. All interim award fee payments will be superseded by 
the final award fee determination.
    (3) Provisional award fee payments will [insert ``not'' if 
applicable] be made under this contract pending each interim evaluation. 
If applicable, provisional award fee payments will be made to the 
Contractor on a [insert the frequency of provisional payments (not more 
often than monthly)] basis. The amount of award fee which will be 
provisionally paid in each evaluation period is limited to [Insert a 
percent not to exceed 80 percent] of the prior interim evaluation score 
(see [insert applicable cite]). Provisional award fee payments

[[Page 277]]

made each evaluation period will be superseded by the interim award fee 
evaluation for that period. If provisional payments made exceed the 
interim evaluation score, the Contractor will either credit the next 
payment voucher for the amount of such overpayment or refund the 
difference to the Government, as directed by the Contracting Officer. If 
the Government determines that (i) the total amount of provisional fee 
payments will apparently substantially exceed the anticipated final 
evaluation score, or (ii) the prior interim evaluation is ``poor/
unsatisfactory,'' the Contracting Officer will direct the suspension or 
reduction of the future payments and/or request a prompt refund of 
excess payments as appropriate. Written notification of the 
determination will be provided to the Contractor with a copy to the 
Deputy Chief Financial Officer (Finance).
    (4) All interim (and provisional, if applicable) fee payments will 
be superseded by the fee determination made in the final award fee 
evaluation. The Government will then pay the Contractor, or the 
Contractor will refund to the Government the difference between the 
final award fee determination and the cumulative interim (and 
provisional, if applicable) fee payments. If the final award fee 
evaluation is ``poor/unsatisfactory'', any base fee paid will be 
refunded to the Government.
    (5) Payment of base fee, if applicable, will be made based on 
submission of an invoice by the Contractor. Payment of award fee will be 
made by the [insert payment office] based on [Insert method of making 
award fee payment, e.g., issuance of a unilateral modification by the

    (d) Award fee determinations are unilateral decisions made solely at

                    Performance Incentive (JAN 1997)

    (a) A performance incentive applies to the following hardware 
item(s) delivered under this contract: (1).
    The performance incentive will measure the performance of those 
items against the salient hardware performance requirement, called 
``unit(s) of measurement,'' e.g., months in service or amount of data 
transmitted, identified below. The performance incentive becomes 
effective when the hardware is put into service. It includes a standard 
performance level, a positive incentive, and a negative incentive, which 
are described in this clause.
    (b) Standard performance level. At the standard performance level, 
the Contractor has met the contract requirement for the unit of 
measurement. Neither positive nor negative incentives apply when this 
level is achieved but not exceeded. The standard performance level for 
(1) ---- is established as follows: (2).
    (c) Positive incentive. The Contractor earns a separate positive 
incentive amount for each hardware item listed in paragraph (a) of this 
clause when the standard performance level for that item is exceeded. 
The amount earned for each item varies with the units of measurement 
achieved, up to a maximum positive performance incentive amount of $ (3) 
---- per item. The units of measurement and the incentive amounts 
associated with achieving each unit are shown below: (4).
    (d) Negative incentive. The Contractor will pay to the Government a 
negative incentive amount for each hardware item that fails to achieve 
the standard performance level. The amount to be paid for each item 
varies with the units of measurement achieved, up to the maximum 
negative incentive amount of $ (5) ----. The units of measurement and 
the incentive amounts associated with achieving each unit are shown 
below: (6).
    (e) The final calculation of positive or negative performance 
incentive amounts shall be done when performance (as defined by the unit 
of measurement) ceases or when the maximum positive incentive is 
reached.
    (1) When the Contracting Officer determines that the performance 
level achieved fell below the standard performance level, the Contractor 
will either pay the amount due the Government or credit the next payment 
voucher for the amount due, as directed by the Contracting Officer.

[[Page 280]]

    (2) When the performance level exceeds the standard level, the 
Contractor may request payment of the incentive amount associated with a 
given level of performance, provided that such payments shall not be 
more frequent than monthly. When performance ceases or the maximum 
positive incentive is reached, the Government shall calculate the final 
performance incentive earned and unpaid and promptly remit it to the 
contractor.
    (f) If performance cannot be demonstrated, through no fault of the 
Contractor, within [insert number of months or years] after the date of 
hardware acceptance by the Government, the Contractor will be paid 
[insert percentage] of the maximum performance incentive.
    (g) The decisions made as to the amount(s) of positive or negative 
incentives are subject to the Disputes clause.
    (1) Insert applicable item number(s) and/or nomenclature.
    (2) Insert a specific unit of measurement for each hardware item 
listed in (1) and each salient characteristic, if more than one.
    (3) Insert the maximum positive performance incentive amount (see 
1816.402-270(e) (1) and (2)).
    (4) Insert all units of measurement and associated dollar amounts up 
to the maximum performance incentive.
    (5) Insert the appropriate amount in accordance with 1816.402-
270(e).
    (6) Insert all units of measurement and associated dollar amounts up 
to the maximum negative performance incentive.

Sec. 1852.223-70  Safety and health.

    As prescribed in 1823.7004(c), insert the following clause:

                      Safety and Health (APR 2002)

    (a) Safety is the freedom from those conditions that can cause 
death, injury, occupational illness, damage to or loss of equipment or 
property, or damage to the environment. NASA's safety priority is to 
protect: (1) The public, (2) astronauts and pilots, (3) the NASA 
workforce (including contractor employees working on NASA contracts), 
and (4) high-value equipment and property.
    (b) The Contractor shall take all reasonable safety and occupational 
health measures in performing this contract. The Contractor shall comply 
with all Federal, State, and local laws applicable to safety and 
occupational health and with the safety and occupational health 
standards, specifications, reporting requirements, and any other 
relevant requirements of this contract.
    (c) The Contractor shall take, or cause to be taken, any other 
safety, and occupational health measures the Contracting Officer may 
reasonably direct. To the extent that the Contractor may be entitled to 
an equitable adjustment for those measures under the terms and 
conditions of this contract, the equitable adjustment shall be 
determined pursuant to the procedures of the changes clause of this 
contract; provided, that no adjustment shall be made under this Safety 
and Health clause for any change for which an equitable adjustment is 
expressly provided under any other clause of the contract.
    (d) The Contractor shall immediately notify and promptly report to 
the Contracting Officer or a designee any accident, incident, or 
exposure resulting in fatality, lost-time occupational injury, 
occupational disease, contamination of property beyond any stated 
acceptable limits set forth in the contract Schedule; or property loss 
of $25,000 or more, or Close Call (a situation or occurrence with no 
injury, no damage or only minor damage (less than $1,000) but possesses 
the potential to cause any type mishap, or any injury, damage, or 
negative mission impact) that may be of immediate interest to NASA, 
arising out of work performed under this contract. The Contractor is not 
required to include in any report an expression of opinion as to the 
fault or negligence of any employee. In addition, service contractors 
(excluding construction contracts) shall provide quarterly reports 
specifying lost-time frequency rate, number of lost-time injuries, 
exposure, and accident/incident dollar losses as specified in the 
contract Schedule.
    (e) The Contractor shall investigate all work-related incidents, 
accidents, and Close Calls, to the extent necessary to determine their 
causes and furnish the Contracting Officer a report, in such form as the 
Contracting Officer may require, of the investigative findings and 
proposed or completed corrective actions.
    (f)(1) The Contracting Officer may notify the Contractor in writing 
of any noncompliance with this clause and specify corrective actions to 
be taken. When the Contracting Officer becomes aware of noncompliance 
that may pose a serious or imminent danger to safety and health of the 
public, astronauts and pilots, the NASA workforce (including

[[Page 285]]

contractor employees working on NASA contracts), or high value mission 
critical equipment or property, the Contracting Officer shall notify the 
Contractor orally, with written confirmation. The Contractor shall 
promptly take and report any necessary corrective action.
    (2) If the Contractor fails or refuses to institute prompt 
corrective action in accordance with subparagraph (f)(1) of this clause, 
the Contracting Officer may invoke the stop-work order clause in this 
contract or any other remedy available to the Government in the event of 
such failure or refusal.
    (g) The Contractor (or subcontractor or supplier) shall insert the 
substance of this clause, including this paragraph (g) and any 
applicable Schedule provisions and clauses, with appropriate changes of 
designations of the parties, in all solicitations and subcontracts of 
every tier, when one or more of the following conditions exist:
    (1) The work will be conducted completely or partly on premises 
owned or controlled by the Government.
    (2) The work includes construction, alteration, or repair of 
facilities in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold.
    (3) The work, regardless of place of performance, involves hazards 
that could endanger the public, astronauts and pilots, the NASA 
workforce (including Contractor employees working on NASA contracts), or 
high value equipment or property, and the hazards are not adequately 
addressed by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or 
Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations (if applicable).
    (4) When the Contractor (or subcontractor or supplier) determines 
that the assessed risk and consequences of a failure to properly manage 
and control the hazard(s) warrants use of the clause.
    (h) The Contractor (or subcontractor or supplier) may exclude the 
provisions of paragraph (g) from its solicitation(s) and subcontract(s) 
of every tier when it determines that the clause is not necessary 
because the application of the OSHA and DOT (if applicable) regulations 
constitute adequate safety and occupational health protection. When a 
determination is made to exclude the provisions of paragraph (g) from a 
solicitation and subcontract, the Contractor must notify and provide the 
basis for the determination to the Contracting Officer. In subcontracts 
of every tier above the micro-purchase threshold for which paragraph (g) 
does not apply, the Contractor (or subcontractor or supplier) shall 
insert the substance of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (f) of this 
clause).
    (i) Authorized Government representatives of the Contracting Officer 
shall have access to and the right to examine the sites or areas where 
work under this contract is being performed in order to determine the 
adequacy of the Contractor's safety and occupational health measures 
under this clause.
    (j) The contractor shall continually update the safety and health 
plan when necessary. In particular, the Contractor shall furnish a list 
of all hazardous operations to be performed, and a list of other major 
or key operations required or planned in the performance of the 
contract, even though not deemed hazardous by the Contractor. NASA and 
the Contractor shall jointly decide which operations are to be 
considered hazardous, with NASA as the final authority. Before hazardous 
operations commence, the Contractor shall submit for NASA concurrence--
    (1) Written hazardous operating procedures for all hazardous 
operations; and/or
    (2) Qualification standards for personnel involved in hazardous 
operations.

                Safety and Health (Short Form) (APR 2002)

    (a) Safety is the freedom from those conditions that can cause 
death, injury, occupational illness; damage to or loss of equipment or 
property, or damage to the environment. NASA's safety priority is to 
protect: (1) The public, (2) astronauts and pilots, (3) the NASA

this contract. The Contractor shall comply with all Federal, State, and 
local laws applicable to safety and occupational health and with the 
safety and occupational health standards, specifications, reporting 
requirements, and any other relevant requirements of this contract.
    (c) The Contractor shall take, or cause to be taken, any other 
safety, and occupational health measures the Contracting Officer may 
reasonably direct. To the extent that the Contractor may be entitled to 
an equitable adjustment for those measures under the terms and 
conditions of this contract, the equitable adjustment shall be 
determined pursuant to the procedures of the Changes clause of this 
contract; provided, that no adjustment shall be made under this Safety 
and Health clause for any change for which an equitable adjustment is 
expressly provided under any other clause of the contract.
    (d) The Contracting Officer may notify the Contractor in writing of 
any noncompliance with this clause and specify corrective actions to be 
taken. In situations where the Contracting Officer becomes aware of 
noncompliance that may pose a serious or imminent danger to safety and 
health of the public, astronauts and pilots, the NASA workforce 
(including Contractor employees working on NASA contracts), or high 
value mission critical equipment or property, the Contracting Officer 
shall notify the Contractor orally, with written confirmation. The 
Contractor shall promptly take and report any necessary corrective 
action. The Government may pursue appropriate remedies in the event the 
Contractor fails to promptly take the necessary corrective action.
    (e) The Contractor (or subcontractor or supplier) shall insert the 
substance of this clause, including this paragraph (d) and any 
applicable Schedule provisions, with appropriate changes of designations

    (a) Definitions. As used in this clause the terms ``employee,'' 
``controlled substance,'' ``employee in a sensitive position,'' and 
``use, in violation of applicable law or Federal regulation, of 
alcohol'' are as defined in 48 CFR 1823.570-2.
    (b) (1) The Contractor shall institute and maintain a program for 
achieving a drug- and alcohol-free workforce. As a minimum, the program 
shall provide for preemployment, reasonable suspicion, random, post-
accident, and periodic recurring (follow-up) testing of contractor 
employees in sensitive positions for use, in violation of applicable law 
or Federal regulation, of alcohol or a controlled substance. The 
Contractor may establish its testing or rehabilitation program in 
cooperation with other contractors or organizations.
    (2) This clause neither prohibits nor requires the Contractor to 
test employees in a foreign country. If the Contractor chooses to 
conduct such testing, this does not authorize the Contractor to violate 
foreign law in conducting such testing.
    (3) The Contractor's program shall test for the use of marijuana and 
cocaine. The Contractor's program may test for the use of other 
controlled substances.
    (4) The Contractor's program shall conform to the ``Mandatory 
Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs'' published by 
the Department of Health and Human Services (59 FR 29908, June 9, 1994) 
and the procedures in 49 CFR part 40, ``Procedures for Transportation 
Workplace Drug Testing Programs,'' in which references to ``DOT'' shall 
be read as ``NASA'', and the split sample method of collection shall be 
used.
    (c) (1) The Contractor's program shall provide, where appropriate, 
for the suspension, disqualification, or dismissal of any employee in a 
sensitive position in any instance where a test conducted and confirmed 
under the Contractor's program indicates that such individual has used, 
in violation of applicable law or Federal regulation, alcohol or a 
controlled substance.
    (2) The Contractor's program shall further prohibit any such 
individual from working in a sensitive position on a NASA contract, 
unless such individual has completed a program of rehabilitation 
described in paragraph (d) of this clause.
    (3) The Contractor's program shall further prohibit any such 
individual from working in any sensitive position on a NASA contract if 
the individual is determined under the Contractor's program to have 
used, in violation of applicable law or Federal regulation, alcohol or a 
controlled substance and the individual meets any of the following 
criteria:
    (i) The individual had undertaken or completed a rehabilitation 
program described in paragraph (d) of this clause prior to such use;
    (ii) Following such determination, the individual refuses to 
undertake such a rehabilitation program;
    (iii) Following such determination, the individual fails to complete 
such a rehabilitation program; or
    (iv) The individual used a controlled substance or alcohol while on 
duty.
    (d) The Contractor shall institute and maintain an appropriate 
rehabilitation program which shall, as a minimum, provide for the 
identification and opportunity for treatment of employees whose duties 
include responsibility for safety-sensitive, security, or National 
security functions who are in need of assistance in resolving problems 
with the use of alcohol or controlled substances.
    (e) The requirements of this clause shall take precedence over any 
state or local Government laws, rules, regulations, ordinances, 
standards, or orders that are inconsistent with the requirements of this 
clause.
    (f) For any collective bargaining agreement, the Contractor will 
negotiate the terms of its program with employee representatives, as 
appropriate, under labor relations laws or negotiated agreements. Such 
negotiation, however, cannot change the requirements of this clause. 
Employees covered under collective bargaining agreements will not be 
subject to the requirements of this clause until those agreements have 
been modified, as necessary; provided, however, that if one year after 
commencement of negotiation the parties have failed to reach agreement, 
an impasse will be determined to have been reached and the Contractor 
will unilaterally implement the requirements of this clause.
    (g) The Contractor shall insert a clause containing all the terms of 
this clause, including this paragraph (g), in all subcontracts in which 
work is performed by an employee in a sensitive position, except 
subcontracts for commercial items (see FAR parts 2 and 12).

    As prescribed in 1823.7001(d), insert the following clause:

              Major Breach of Safety or Security (FEB 2002)

    (a) Safety is the freedom from those conditions that can cause 
death, injury, occupational illness, damage to or loss of equipment or 
property, or damage to the environment. Safety is essential to NASA and 
is a material part of this contract. NASA's safety priority is to 
protect: (1) The public; (2) astronauts and pilots; (3) the NASA 
workforce (including contractor employees working on NASA contracts); 
and (4) high-value equipment and property. A major breach of safety may 
constitute a breach of contract that entitles the Government to exercise 
any of its rights and remedies applicable to material parts of this 
contract, including termination for default. A major breach of safety 
must be related directly to the work on the contract. A major breach of 
safety is an act or omission of the Contractor that consists of an 
accident, incident, or exposure resulting in a fatality or mission 
failure; or in damage to equipment or property equal to or greater than 
$1 million; or in any ``willful'' or ``repeat'' violation cited by the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or by a state 
agency operating under an OSHA approved plan.
    (b) Security is the condition of safeguarding against espionage, 
sabotage, crime (including computer crime), or attack. A major breach of 
security may constitute a breach of contract that entitles the 
Government to exercise any of its rights and remedies applicable to 
material parts of this contract, including termination for default. A 
major breach of security may occur on or off Government installations, 
but must be related directly to the work on the contract. A major breach 
of security is an act or omission by the Contractor that results in 
compromise of classified information, illegal technology transfer, 
workplace violence resulting in criminal conviction, sabotage, 
compromise or denial of information technology services, equipment or 
property damage from vandalism greater than $250,000, or theft greater 
than $250,000.
    (c) In the event of a major breach of safety or security, the 
Contractor shall report the breach to the Contracting Officer. If 
directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall conduct its 
own investigation and report the results to the Government. The 
Contractor shall cooperate with the Government investigation, if 
conducted.

paragraphs (a) and (b) for paragraphs (a) and (b) of the basic clause:
    (a) Safety is the freedom from those conditions that can cause 
death, injury, occupational illness, damage to or loss of equipment or 
property, or damage to the environment. Safety is essential to NASA and 
is a material part of this contract. NASA's safety priority is to 
protect: (1) The public; (2) astronauts and pilots; (3) the NASA 
workforce (including contractor employees working on NASA contracts); 
and (4) high-value equipment and property. A major breach of safety may 
constitute a breach of contract that entitles the Government to exercise 
any of its rights and remedies applicable to material parts of this 
contract, including termination. A major breach of safety must be 
related directly to the work on the contract. A major breach of safety 
is an act or omission of the Contractor that consists of an accident, 
incident, or exposure resulting in a fatality or mission failure; or in 
damage to equipment or property equal to or greater than $1 million; or 
in any ``willful'' or ``repeat'' violation cited by the Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or by a state agency operating 
under an OSHA approved plan.
    (b) Security is the condition of safeguarding against espionage, 
sabotage, crime (including computer crime), or attack. A major breach of 
security may constitute a breach of contract that entitles the 
Government to exercise any of its rights and remedies applicable to 
material parts of this contract, including termination. A major breach 
of security may occur on or off Government installations, but must be 
related directly to the work on the contract. A major breach of security 
is an act or omission by the Contractor that results in compromise of 
classified information, illegal technology transfer, workplace violence 
resulting in criminal conviction, sabotage, compromise or denial of 
information technology services, equipment or property damage from 
vandalism greater than $250,000, or theft greater than $250,000.

the date of determination (as defined in section 41(d) of the Plant 
Variety Protection Act, 7 U.S.C. 2401(d)) must also occur during the 
period of contract performance.
    Nonprofit organization, as used in this clause, means a domestic 
university or other institution of higher education or an organization 
of the type described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)) and exempt from taxation under section 501(a) 
of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(a)), or any domestic 
nonprofit scientific or educational organization qualified under a State 
nonprofit organization statute.
    Practical application, as used in this clause, means to manufacture, 
in the case of a composition or product; to practice, in the case of a 
process or method; or to operate, in case of a machine or system; and, 
in each case, under such conditions as to establish that the invention 
is being utilized and that its benefits are, to the extent permitted by 
law or Government regulations, available to the public on reasonable 
terms.
    Reportable item, as used in this clause, means any invention, 
discovery, improvement, or innovation of the contractor, whether or not 
patentable or otherwise protectible under Title 35 of the United States 
Code, made in the performance of any work under any NASA contract or in 
the performance of any work that is reimbursable under any clause in any 
NASA contract providing for reimbursement of costs incurred before the 
effective date of the contract. Reportable items include, but are not 
limited to, new processes, machines, manufactures, and compositions of 
matter, and improvements to, or new applications of, existing processes, 
machines, manufactures, and compositions of matter. Reportable items 
also include new computer programs, and improvements to, or new 
applications of, existing computer programs, whether or not 
copyrightable or otherwise protectible under Title 17 of the United 
States Code.
    Small business firm, as used in this clause, means a domestic small

seq.).
    (b) Allocation of principal rights--(1) Presumption of title. (i) 
Any reportable item that the Administrator considers to be a subject 
invention shall be presumed to have been made in the manner specified in 
paragraph (1) or (2) of section 305(a) of the National Aeronautics and 
Space Act of 1958 (42 U.S.C. 2457(a)) (hereinafter called ``the Act''), 
and the above presumption shall be conclusive unless at the time of 
reporting the reportable item the Contractor submits to the Contracting 
Officer a written statement, containing supporting details, 
demonstrating that the reportable item was not made in the manner 
specified in paragraph (1) or (2) of section 305(a) of the Act.
    (ii) Regardless of whether title to a given subject invention would 
otherwise be subject to an advance waiver or is the subject of a 
petition for waiver, the Contractor may nevertheless file the statement 
described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this clause. The Administrator will 
review the information furnished by the Contractor in any such statement 
and any other available information relating to the circumstances 
surrounding the making of the subject invention and will notify the 
Contractor whether the Administrator has determined that the subject 
invention was made in the manner specified in paragraph (1) or (2) of 
section 305(a) of the Act.
    (2) Property rights in subject inventions. Each subject invention 
for which the presumption of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this clause is 
conclusive or for which there has been a determination that it was made 
in the manner specified in paragraph (1) or (2) of section 305(a) of the 
Act shall be the exclusive property of the United States as represented 
by NASA unless the Administrator waives all or any part of the rights of 
the United States, as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this clause.
    (3) Waiver of rights. (i) Section 305(f) of the Act provides for the 
promulgation of regulations by which the Administrator may waive the 
rights of the United States with respect to any invention or class of 
inventions made or that may be made under conditions specified in 
paragraph (1) or (2) of section 305(a) of the Act. The promulgated NASA 
Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1, have adopted the 
Presidential Memorandum on Government Patent Policy of February 18, 
1983, as a guide in acting on petitions (requests) for such waiver of 
rights.
    (ii) As provided in 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1, Contractors may 
petition, either prior to execution of the contract or within 30 days 
after execution of the contract, for advance waiver of rights to any or 
all of the

[[Page 292]]

inventions that may be made under a contract. If such a petition is not 
submitted, or if after submission it is denied, the Contractor (or an 
employee inventor of the Contractor) may petition for waiver of rights 
to an identified subject invention within eight months of first 
disclosure of invention in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this 
clause, or within such longer period as may be authorized in accordance 
with 14 CFR 1245.105.
    (c) Minimum rights reserved by the Government. (1) With respect to 
each subject invention for which a waiver of rights is applicable in 
accordance with 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1, the Government reserves--
    (i) An irrevocable, nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free 
license for the practice of such invention throughout the world by or on 
behalf of the United States or any foreign government in accordance with 
any treaty or agreement with the United States; and
    (ii) Such other rights as stated in 14 CFR 1245.107.
    (2) Nothing contained in this paragraph (c) shall be considered to 
grant to the Government any rights with respect to any invention other 
than a subject invention.
    (d) Minimum rights to the Contractor. (1) The Contractor is hereby 
granted a revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license in each patent 
application filed in any country on a subject invention and any 
resulting patent in which the Government acquires title, unless the 
Contractor fails to disclose the subject invention within the times 
specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this clause. The Contractor's license 
extends to its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the 
corporate structure of which the Contractor is a party and includes the 
right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the 
Contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was 
awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of the 
Administrator except when transferred to the successor of that part of 
the Contractor's business to which the invention pertains.
    (2) The Contractor's domestic license may be revoked or modified by 
the Administrator to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious 
practical application of the subject invention pursuant to an 
application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with 37 CFR 
part 404, Licensing of Government Owned Inventions. This license will 
not be revoked in that field of use or the geographical areas in which 
the Contractor has achieved practical application and continues to make 
the benefits of the invention reasonably accessible to the public. The 
license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at the 
discretion of the Administrator to the extent the Contractor, its 
licensees, or its domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to 
achieve practical application in that foreign country.
    (3) Before revocation or modification of the license, the Contractor 
will be provided a written notice of the Administrator's intention to 
revoke or modify the license, and the Contractor will be allowed 30 days 
(or such other time as may be authorized by the Administrator for good 
cause shown by the Contractor) after the notice to show cause why the 
license should not be revoked or modified. The Contractor has the right 
to appeal to the Administrator any decision concerning the revocation or 
modification of its license.
    (e) Invention identification, disclosures, and reports. (1) The 
Contractor shall establish and maintain active and effective procedures 
to assure that reportable items are promptly identified and disclosed to 
Contractor personnel responsible for the administration of this New 
Technology clause within six months of conception and/or first actual 
reduction to practice, whichever occurs first in the performance of work 
under this contract. These procedures shall include the maintenance of 
laboratory notebooks or equivalent records and other records as are 
reasonably necessary to document the conception and/or the first actual 
reduction to practice of the reportable items, and records that show 
that the procedures for identifying and disclosing reportable items are 
followed. Upon request, the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting 
Officer a description of such procedures for evaluation and for 
determination as to their effectiveness.
    (2) The Contractor will disclose each reportable item to the 
Contracting Officer within two months after the inventor discloses it in 
writing to Contractor personnel responsible for the administration of 
this New Technology clause or, if earlier, within six months after the 
Contractor becomes aware that a reportable item has been made, but in 
any event for subject inventions before any on sale, public use, or 
publication of such invention known to the Contractor. The disclosure to 
the agency shall be in the form of a written report and shall identify 
the contract under which the reportable item was made and the 
inventor(s) or innovator(s). It shall be sufficiently complete in 
technical detail to convey a clear understanding, to the extent known at 
the time of the disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and 
physical, chemical, biological, or electrical characteristics of the 
reportable item. The disclosure shall also identify any publication, on 
sale, or public use of any subject invention and whether a manuscript 
describing such invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, 
whether it has been accepted for publication at the time of disclosure. 
In addition, after disclosure to the agency, the Contractor will 
promptly notify the agency of the acceptance of any

[[Page 293]]

manuscript describing a subject invention for publication or of any on 
sale or public use planned by the Contractor for such invention.
    (3) The Contractor may use whatever format is convenient to disclose 
reportable items required in subparagraph (e)(2). NASA prefers that the 
Contractor use either the electronic or paper version of NASA Form 1679, 
Disclosure of Invention and New Technology (Including Software) to 
disclose reportable items. Both the electronic and paper versions of 
NASA Form 1679 may be accessed at the electronic New Technology 
Reporting Web site http://invention.nasa.gov.
    (4) The Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer the 
following:
    (i) Interim reports every 12 months (or such longer period as may be 
specified by the Contracting Officer) from the date of the contract, 
listing reportable items during that period, and certifying that all 
reportable items have been disclosed (or that there are no such 
inventions) and that the procedures required by paragraph (e)(1) of this 
clause have been followed.
    (ii) A final report, within 3 months after completion of the 
contracted work, listing all reportable items or certifying that there 
were no such reportable items, and listing all subcontracts at any tier 
containing a patent rights clause or certifying that there were no such 
subcontracts.
    (5) The Contractor agrees, upon written request of the Contracting 
Officer, to furnish additional technical and other information available 
to the Contractor as is necessary for the preparation of a patent 
application on a subject invention and for the prosecution of the patent 
application, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent 
applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government's 
rights in the subject inventions.
    (6) The Contractor agrees, subject to section 27.302(i), of the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), that the Government may duplicate 
and disclose subject invention disclosures and all other reports and 
papers furnished or required to be furnished pursuant to this clause.
    (f) Examination of records relating to inventions. (1) The 
Contracting Officer or any authorized representative shall, until 3 
years after final payment under this contract, have the right to examine 
any books (including laboratory notebooks), records, and documents of 
the Contractor relating to the conception or first actual reduction to 
practice of inventions in the same field of technology as the work under 
this contract to determine whether--
    (i) Any such inventions are subject inventions;
    (ii) The Contractor has established and maintained the procedures 
required by paragraph (e)(1) of this clause; and
    (iii) The Contractor and its inventors have complied with the 
procedures.
    (2) If the Contracting Officer learns of an unreported Contractor 
invention that the Contracting Officer believes may be a subject 
invention, the Contractor may be required to disclose the invention to 
the agency for a determination of ownership rights.
    (3) Any examination of records under this paragraph will be subject 
to appropriate conditions to protect the confidentiality of the 
information involved.
    (g) Withholding of payment (this paragraph does not apply to 
subcontracts). (1) Any time before final payment under this contract, 
the Contracting Officer may, in the Government's interest, withhold 
payment until a reserve not exceeding $50,000 or 5 percent of the amount 
of this contract, whichever is less, shall have been set aside if, in 
the Contracting Officer's opinion, the Contractor fails to--
    (i) Establish, maintain, and follow effective procedures for 
identifying and disclosing reportable items pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) 
of this clause;
    (ii) Disclose any reportable items pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of 
this clause;
    (iii) Deliver acceptable interim reports pursuant to paragraph 
(e)(3)(i) of this clause; or
    (iv) Provide the information regarding subcontracts pursuant to 
paragraph (h)(4) of this clause.
    (2) Such reserve or balance shall be withheld until the Contracting 
Officer has determined that the Contractor has rectified whatever 
deficiencies exist and has delivered all reports, disclosures, and other 
information required by this clause.
    (3) Final payment under this contract shall not be made before the 
Contractor delivers to the Contracting Officer all disclosures of 
reportable items required by paragraph (e)(2) of this clause, and an 
acceptable final report pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this clause.
    (4) The Contracting Officer may decrease or increase the sums 
withheld up to the maximum authorized above. No amount shall be withheld 
under this paragraph while the amount specified by this paragraph is 
being withheld under other provisions of the contract. The withholding 
of any amount or the subsequent payment thereof shall not be construed 
as a waiver of any Government rights.
    (h) Subcontracts. (1) Unless otherwise authorized or directed by the 
Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall--
    (i) Include this clause (suitably modified to identify the parties) 
in any subcontract hereunder (regardless of tier) with other than a 
small business firm or nonprofit organization for the performance of 
experimental, developmental, or research work; and

[[Page 294]]

    (ii) Include the clause at FAR 52.227-11 (suitably modified to 
identify the parties) in any subcontract hereunder (regardless of tier) 
with a small business firm or nonprofit organization for the performance 
of experimental, developmental, or research work.
    (2) In the event of a refusal by a prospective subcontractor to 
accept such a clause the Contractor--
    (i) Shall promptly submit a written notice to the Contracting 
Officer setting forth the subcontractor's reasons for such refusal and 
other pertinent information that may expedite disposition of the matter; 
and
    (ii) Shall not proceed with such subcontract without the written 
authorization of the Contracting Officer.
    (3) In the case of subcontracts at any tier, the agency, 
subcontractor, and Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the 
parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the 
subcontractor and NASA with respect to those matters covered by this 
clause.
    (4) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in 
writing upon the award of any subcontract at any tier containing a 
patent rights clause by identifying the subcontractor, the applicable 
patent rights clause, the work to be performed under the subcontract, 
and the dates of award and estimated completion. Upon request of the 
Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall furnish a copy of such 
subcontract, and, no more frequently than annually, a listing of the 
subcontracts that have been awarded.
    (5) The subcontractor will retain all rights provided for the 
Contractor in the clause of paragraph (h)(1)(i) or (ii) of this clause, 
whichever is included in the subcontract, and the Contractor will not, 
as part of the consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights 
in the subcontractor's subject inventions.
    (i) Preference for United States industry. Unless provided 
otherwise, no Contractor that receives title to any subject invention 
and no assignee of any such Contractor shall grant to any person the 
exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United 
States unless such person agrees that any products embodying the subject 
invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. 
However, in individual cases, the requirement may be waived by the 
Administrator upon a showing by the Contractor or assignee that 
reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on 
similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture 
substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances 
domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.

Sec. 1852.227-71  Requests for waiver of rights to inventions.

    As prescribed in 1827.30-70(c), insert the following provision in 
all solicitations that include the clause at 1852.227-70, New 
Technology:

         Requests for Waiver of Rights to Inventions (APR 1984)

    (a) In accordance with the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR 
part 1245, subpart 1, waiver of rights to any or all inventions made or 
that may be made under a NASA contract or subcontract with other than a 
small business firm or a domestic nonprofit organization may be 
requested at different time periods. Advance waiver of rights to any or 
all inventions that may be made under a contract or subcontract may be 
requested prior to the execution of the contract or subcontract, or 
within 30 days after execution by the selected contractor. In addition, 
waiver of rights to an identified invention made and reported under a 
contract or subcontract may be requested, even though a request for an 
advance waiver was not made or, if made, was not granted.
    (b) Each request for waiver of rights shall be by petition to the 
Administrator and shall include an identification of the petitioner; 
place of business and address; if petitioner is represented by counsel, 
the name, address and telephone number of the counsel; the signature of 
the petitioner or authorized representative; and the date of signature. 
No specific forms need be used, but the request should contain a 
positive statement that waiver of rights is being requested under the 
NASA Patent Waiver Regulations; a clear indication of whether the 
request is for an advance waiver or for a waiver of rights for an 
individual identified invention; whether foreign rights are also 
requested and, if so, the countries, and a citation of the specific 
section or sections of the regulations under which such rights are 
requested; and the name, address, and telephone number of the party with 
whom to communicate when the request is acted upon. Requests for advance 
waiver of rights should, preferably, be included with the proposal, but 
in any event in advance of negotiations.
    (c) Petitions for advance waiver, prior to contract execution, must 
be submitted to the Contracting Officer. All other petitions will be 
submitted to the Patent Representative designated in the contract.

[[Page 295]]

    (d) Petitions submitted with proposals selected for negotiation of a 
contract will be forwarded by the Contracting Officer to the 
installation Patent Counsel for processing and then to the Inventions 
and Contributions Board. The Board will consider these petitions and 
where the Board makes the findings to support the waiver, the Board will 
recommend to the Administrator that waiver be granted, and will notify 
the petitioner and the Contracting Officer of the Administrator's 
determination. The Contracting Officer will be informed by the Board 
whenever there is insufficient time or information or other reasons to 
permit a decision to be made without unduly delaying the execution of 
the contract. In the latter event, the petitioner will be so notified by 
the Contracting Officer. All other petitions will be processed by 
installation Patent Counsel and forwarded to the Board. The Board shall 
notify the petitioner of its action and if waiver is granted, the 
conditions, reservations, and obligations thereof will be included in 
the Instrument of Waiver. Whenever the Board notifies a petitioner of a 
recommendation adverse to, or different from, the waiver requested, the 
petitioner may request reconsideration under procedures set forth in the 
Regulations.

Sec. 1852.227-86  Commercial computer software--Licensing.

    As prescribed in 1827.409-70, insert the following clause:

           Commercial Computer Software--Licensing (DEC 1987)

    (a) Any delivered commercial computer software (including 
documentation thereof) developed at private expense and claimed as 
proprietary shall be subject to the restricted rights in paragraph (d) 
of this clause. Where the vendor/contractor proposes its standard 
commercial software license, those applicable portions thereof 
consistent with Federal laws, standard industry practices, the Federal 
Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and the NASA FAR Supplement, including the 
restricted rights in paragraph (d) of this clause, are incorporated into 
and made a part of this purchase order/contract.
    (b) Although the vendor/contractor may not propose its standard 
commercial software license until after this purchase order/contract has 
been issued, or at or after the time the computer software is delivered, 
such license shall nevertheless be deemed incorporated into and made a 
part of this purchase order/contract under the same terms and conditions 
as in paragraph (a) of this clause. For purposes of receiving updates, 
correction notices, consultation, and similar activities on the computer 
software, the NASA Contracting Officer or the NASA Contracting Officer's 
Technical Representative/User may sign any agreement, license, or 
registration form or card and return it directly to the vendor/
contractor; however, such signing shall not alter any of the terms and 
conditions of this clause.
    (c) The vendor's/contractor's acceptance is expressly limited to the 
terms and conditions of this purchase order/contract. If the specified 
computer software is shipped or delivered to NASA, it shall be 
understood that the vendor/contractor has unconditionally accepted the 
terms and conditions set forth in this clause, and that such terms and 
conditions (including the incorporated license) constitute the entire 
agreement between the parties concerning rights in the computer 
software.
    (d) The following restricted rights shall apply:
    (1) The commercial computer software may not be used, reproduced, or 
disclosed by the Government except as provided below or otherwise 
expressly stated in the purchase order/contract.
    (2) The commercial computer software may be--
    (i) Used, or copied for use, in or with any computer owned or leased 
by, or on behalf of, the Government; provided, the software is not used, 
nor copied for use, in or with more than one computer simultaneously, 
unless otherwise permitted by the license incorporated under paragraph 
(a) or (b) of this clause;
    (ii) Reproduced for safekeeping (archives) or backup purposes;
    (iii) Modified, adapted, or combined with other computer software, 
provided that the modified, combined, or adapted portions of

[[Page 297]]

the derivative software incorporating restricted computer software shall 
be subject to the same restricted rights; and
    (iv) Disclosed and reproduced for use by Government contractors or 
their subcontractors in accordance with the restricted rights in 
paragraphs (d)(2) (i), (ii), and (iii) of this clause; provided they 
have the Government's permission to use the computer software and have 
also agreed to protect the computer software from unauthorized use and 
disclosure.
    (3) If the incorporated vendor's/contractor's software license 
contains provisions or rights that are less restrictive than the 
restricted rights in paragraph (d)(2) of this clause, then the less 
restrictive provisions or rights shall prevail.
    (4) If the computer software is published, copyrighted computer 
software, it is licensed to the Government, without disclosure 
prohibitions, with the rights in paragraphs (d) (2) and (3) of this 
clause.
    (5) The computer software may be marked with any appropriate 
proprietary notice that is consistent with the rights in paragraphs (d) 
(2), (3), and (4) of this clause.

Sec. 1852.227-87  Transfer of technical data under Space Station 
          International Agreements.

    As prescribed at 1827.670-2, insert the following clause:

 Transfer of Technical Data Under Space Station International Agreement 
                               (APR 1989)

    1. In the cooperative Space Station Freedom program, NASA has the 
authority to provide to the international partners all information 
necessary to implement the multilateral Space Station Intergovernmental 
Agreement and the Space Station Memoranda of Understanding. NASA is 
committed under these Space Station agreements to provide its 
international Space Station partners with certain technical data which 
are subject to the U.S. export control laws and regulations. NASA will 
have obtained any necessary approvals from the Department of State for 
the transfer of any such technical data. Space Station contractors, 
acting as agents of NASA under the specific written direction of the 
Contracting Officer, or designated representative, require no other 
separate approval under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations 
(ITAR) to transfer such data.
    2. The Contractor agrees, when specifically directed in writing by 
the Contracting Officer, or designated representative, to transfer 
identified technical data to a named foreign recipient, in the manner 
directed. No export control marking should be affixed to the data unless 
so directed. If directed, the text of the marking to be affixed will be 
furnished by the Contracting Officer or designated representative.
    3. It should be emphasized that the transfer is limited solely to 
those technical data which NASA specifically identifies and directs the 
Contractor to transfer in accordance with paragraph 2 of this clause, 
and that all other transfers of technical data to foreign entities are 
subject to the requirements of the U.S. export control laws and 
regulations.
    4. Nothing contained in this clause affects the allocation of 
technical data rights between NASA and the Contractor or any 
subcontractors as set forth in the Rights in Data clause of this 
Contract, nor the protection of any proprietary technical data which may 
be available to the Contractor or any subcontractor under that clause.
    5. The Contractor agrees to include this clause, including this 
paragraph 5, in all subcontracts hereunder, appropriately modified to 
reflect the relationship of the parties.

Sec. 1852.228-70  Aircraft ground and flight risk.

    As prescribed in 1828.370(a), insert the following clause. The 
purpose of this clause is to have the Government assume risks that 
generally entail unusually high insurance premiums and are not covered 
by the contractor's contents, work-in-process, and similar insurance. 
Since the definitions in the clause may not cover every situation that 
should be covered to achieve this purpose, the clause may be modified as 
follows: If the contract covers helicopters, vertical take-off aircraft, 
lighter-than-air airships, or other nonconventional types of aircraft, 
the definition of ``aircraft'' should be modified to specify that the 
aircraft has reached a point of manufacture comparable to that specified 
in the standard definition, which is written for conventional winged 
aircraft. The definition of ``in the open'' may be modified to include 
``hush houses,'' test hangars, comparable structures, and other 
designated areas. In addition, clause paragraph (d)(3) may be modified 
to provide for Government assumption of risk of

[[Page 298]]

transportation by conveyance on streets or highways if the contracting 
officer determines that this transportation is limited to the vicinity 
of the contractor's premises and is merely incident to work being 
performed under the contract.

               Aircraft Ground and Flight Risk (OCT 1996)

    (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract, except as 
may be specifically provided in the Schedule as an exception to this 
clause, the Government, subject to the definitions and limitations of 
this clause, assumes the risk of damage to, or loss or destruction of, 
aircraft in the open, during operation, or in flight and agrees that the 
Contractor shall not be liable to the Government for any such damage, 
loss, or destruction.
    (b) For the purposes of this clause, the following definitions 
apply:
    (1) Unless otherwise specifically provided in the Schedule, 
``aircraft'' includes--
    (i) Aircraft (including both complete aircraft and aircraft in the 
course of being manufactured, disassembled, or reassembled; provided 
that an engine, wing, or a portion of a wing is attached to the 
fuselage) to be furnished to the Government under this contract (whether 
before or after Government acceptance); and
    (ii) Aircraft (regardless of whether in a state of disassembly or 
reassembly) furnished by the Government to the Contractor under this 
contract, including all property installed in, being installed in, or 
temporarily removed from them, unless the aircraft and property are 
covered by a separate bailment agreement.
    (2) ``In the open'' means located wholly outside of buildings on the 
Contractor's premises, or at such other places as may be described in 
the Schedule as being in the open for the purposes of this clause, 
except that aircraft furnished by the Government are considered to be in 
the open at all times while in the Contractor's possession, care, 
custody, or control.
    (3) ``Flight'' includes any flight demonstration, flight test, taxi 
test, or other flight made in the performance of this contract, or for 
the purpose of safeguarding the aircraft, or previously approved in 
writing by the Contracting Officer.
    (i) With respect to land-based aircraft, flight commences with the 
taxi roll from a flight line on the Contractor's premises and continues 
until the aircraft has completed the taxi roll in returning to a flight 
line on the Contractor's premises.
    (ii) With respect to seaplanes, flight commences with the launching 
from a ramp on the Contractor's premises and continues until the 
aircraft has completed its landing run upon return and is beached at a 
ramp on the Contractor's premises.
    (iii) With respect to helicopters, flight commences upon engagement 
of the rotors for the purpose of take-off from the Contractor's premises 
and continues until the aircraft has returned to the ground on the 
Contractor's premises and the rotors are disengaged.
    (iv) With respect to vertical take-off aircraft, flight commences 
upon disengagement from any launching platform or device on the 
Contractor's premises and continues until the aircraft has been re-
engaged to any launching platform or device on the Contractor's 
premises; provided, however, that aircraft off the Contractor's premises 
shall be deemed to be in flight when on the ground or water only during 
periods of reasonable duration following emergency landing, other 
landings made in the performance of this contract, or landings approved 
by the Contracting Officer in writing.
    (4) ``Contractor's premises'' means those premises designated as 
such in the Schedule or in writing by the Contracting Officer, and any 
other place to which aircraft are moved for the purpose of safeguarding 
the aircraft.
    (5) ``Operation'' means operations and tests, other than on any 
production line, of aircraft not in flight, whether or not the aircraft 
is in the open or in motion. It includes operations and tests of 
equipment, accessories, and power plants only when installed in 
aircraft.
    (6) ``Flight crew members'' means the pilot, copilot, and, unless 
otherwise specifically provided in the Schedule, the flight engineer and 
navigator when requirement or assigned to their respective crew 
positions to conduct any flight on behalf of the Contractor.
    (7) ``Contractor's managerial personnel'' means the Contractor's 
directors, officers, and any managers, superintendents, or equivalent 
representatives who have supervision or direction of all or 
substantially all of the Contractor's business or of the Contractor's 
operations at any one plant, a separate location at which this contract 
is performed, or a separate and complete major industrial operation in 
connection with the performance of this contract.
    (c)(1) The Government's assumption of risk under this clause, as to 
aircraft in the open, shall continue in effect unless terminated 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this clause. If the Contracting Officer 
finds that an aircraft is in the open under unreasonable conditions, the 
Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor in writing of the 
conditions found to be unreasonable and require the Contractor to 
correct them within a reasonable time.
    (2) Upon receipt of this notice, the Contractor shall act promptly 
to correct these conditions, regardless of whether it agrees that they 
are in fact unreasonable. To the

[[Page 299]]

extent that the Contracting Officer may later determine that they were 
not in fact unreasonable, an equitable adjustment shall be made in the 
contract price to compensate the Contractor for any additional costs 
incurred in correcting them, and the contract shall be modified in 
writing accordingly.
    (3)(i) If the Contracting Officer finds that the Contractor has 
failed to act promptly to correct unreasonable conditions or has failed 
to correct them within a reasonable time, the Contracting Officer may by 
written notice terminate the Government's assumption of risk under this 
clause for any aircraft which is in the open under those conditions. 
This termination shall be effective at 12:01 A.M. on the 15th day 
following the day of receipt by the Contractor of the notice.
    (ii) If the Contracting Officer later determines that the Contractor 
acted promptly to correct the conditions or that the time taken by the 
Contractor was not in fact unreasonable, an equitable adjustment shall, 
notwithstanding paragraph (g) of this clause, be made to compensate the 
Contractor for any additional costs incurred as a result of the 
termination, and the contract shall be modified in writing accordingly.
    (4) If the Government's assumption of risk under this clause is 
terminated in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this clause, the risk 
of loss with respect to Government-furnished property shall be 
determined in accordance with the Government property clause of this 
contract, if any, until the Government's assumption of risk is 
reinstated in accordance with paragraph (c)(5) of this clause.
    (5)(i) When unreasonable conditions have been corrected, the 
Contractor shall promptly notify the Government. The Government may or 
may not elect to reassume the risks and relieve the Contractor of 
liabilities as provided in this clause, and the Contracting Officer 
shall notify the Contractor of the Government's election.
    (ii) If, after correction of the conditions, the Government elects 
to reassume the risks and relieve the Contractor of liabilities, the 
Contractor shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment for any costs of 
insurance extending from the end of the third working day after the 
Contractor notifies the Government of the correction until the 
Government notifies the Contractor of that election.
    (iii) If the Government elects not to reassume the risks and the 
conditions have in fact been corrected, the Contractor shall be entitled 
to an equitable adjustment for any costs of insurance extending after 
the third working day referred to in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this 
clause.
    (d) The Government's assumption of risk shall not extend to damage 
to, or loss or destruction of aircraft--
    (1) Resulting from failure of the Contractor, due to willful 
misconduct or lack of good faith of any of the Contractor's managerial 
personnel, to maintain and administer a program for protecting and 
preserving aircraft in the open and during operation, in accordance with 
sound industrial practice;
    (2) Sustained during flight if the flight crew members conducting 
the flight have not been approved in writing by the Contracting Officer;
    (3) While in the course of transportation by rail or by conveyance 
on public streets, highways, or waterways, except for Government-
furnished property;
    (4) The extent that the damage, loss, or destruction is in fact 
covered by insurance;
    (5) Consisting of wear and tear, deterioration (including rust and 
corrosion), freezing, or mechanical, structural, or electrical breakdown 
or failure, unless this damage is the result of other loss, damage, or 
destruction covered by this clause (except that, in the case of 
Government-furnished property, if the damage consists of reasonable wear 
and tear or deterioration or results from an inherent defect in such 
property, this exclusion shall not apply); or
    (6) Sustained while the aircraft is being worked upon and directly 
resulting from the work, including but not limited to any repairing, 
adjusting, servicing, or maintenance operation, unless the damage, loss, 
or destruction is of a type that would be covered by insurance that 
would customarily have been maintained by the Contractor at the time of 
the damage, loss, or destruction, but for the Government's assumption of 
risk under this clause.
    (e)(1) With the exception of damage to, or loss or destruction of, 
aircraft in flight, the Government's assumption of risk under this 
clause shall not extend to the first $1,000 of loss or damage resulting 
from each separately occurring event. The Contractor assumes the risk of 
and shall be responsible for the first $1,000 of loss of or damage to 
aircraft in the open or during operation resulting from each separately 
occurring event, except for reasonable wear and tear and except to the 
extent the loss or damage is caused by negligence of Government 
personnel.
    (2) If the Government elects to require that the aircraft be 
replaced or restored by the Contractor to its condition immediately 
prior to the damage, the equitable adjustment in the price authorized by 
paragraph (i) of this clause shall not include the dollar amount of the 
risk assumed by the Contractor under this paragraph (e). If the 
Government does not elect repair or replacement, the Contractor agrees 
to credit the contract price or pay the Government $1,000 (or the amount 
of the loss if smaller) as directed by the Contracting Officer.
    (f) No subcontractor may be relieved from liability for damage to, 
or loss or destruction of, aircraft while in its possession or control,

[[Page 300]]

except to the extent that the subcontract, with the Contracting 
Officer's prior written approval, provides for relief of the 
subcontractor from that liability. In the absence of such approval, the 
subcontract shall require the return of the aircraft in as good 
condition as when received, except for reasonable wear and tear or for 
the utilization of the property in accordance with the provisions of 
this contract. If a subcontractor has not been relieved from liability 
and any damage, loss, or destruction occurs, the Contractor shall 
enforce the liability of the subcontractor for that damage to, or loss 
or destruction of, the aircraft for the benefit of the Government.
    (g) The Contractor warrants that the contract price does not and 
will not include, except as this clause may otherwise authorize, any 
charge or contingency reserve for insurance (including self-insurance 
funds or reserves) covering any damage to, or loss or destruction of, 
aircraft while in the open, during operation, or in flight, the risk of 
which has been assumed by the Government under this clause, whether or 
not such assumption may be terminated as to aircraft in the open.
    (h)(1) In the event of damage to, or loss or destruction of, 
aircraft in the open, during operation, or in flight, the Contractor 
shall take all reasonable steps to protect the aircraft from further 
damage, separate damaged and undamaged aircraft, and put all aircraft in 
the best possible order. Further, except in cases covered by paragraph 
(e) of this clause, the Contractor should furnish to the Contracting 
Officer a statement of--
    (i) The damaged, lost, or destroyed aircraft;
    (ii) The time and origin of the damage, loss, or destruction;
    (iii) All known interests in commingled property of which aircraft 
are a part; and
    (iv) Any insurance covering any part of the interest in the 
commingled property.
    (2) Except in cases covered by paragraph (e) of this clause, an 
equitable adjustment shall be made in the amount due under this contract 
for expenditures made by the Contractor in performing its obligations 
under this paragraph (h), and this contract shall be modified in writing 
accordingly.
    (i)(1) If, before delivery and acceptance by the Government, any 
aircraft is damaged, lost, or destroyed and the Government has under 
this clause assumed the risk of that damage, loss, or destruction, the 
Government shall either
    (i) Require that the aircraft be replaced or restored by the 
Contractor to its condition immediately prior to the damage or
    (ii) Terminate this contract with respect to that aircraft.
    (2) If the Government requires that the aircraft be replaced or 
restored, an equitable adjustment shall be made in the amount due under 
this contract and in the time required for its performance, and the 
contract shall be modified in writing accordingly.
    (3) If this contract is terminated under this paragraph (i)(1)(ii) 
with respect to the aircraft, and under this clause the Government has 
assumed the risk of the damage, loss, or destruction, the Contractor 
shall be paid the contract price for the aircraft (or, if applicable, 
any work to be performed on the aircraft) less any amounts the 
Contracting Officer determines (i) that it would have cost the 
Contractor to complete the aircraft (or any work to be performed on it), 
together with any anticipated profit on the uncompleted work and (ii) to 
be the value, if any, of the damaged aircraft or any remaining portion 
of it retained by the Contractor. The Contracting Officer shall have the 
right to prescribe the manner of disposition of the damaged, lost, or 
destroyed aircraft or any remaining parts of it, and, if the Contractor 
incurs additional costs as a result of such disposition, a further 
equitable adjustment shall be made in the amount due to the Contractor.
    (j)(1) If the Contractor is at any time reimbursed or compensated by 
any third person for any damage, loss, or destruction of any aircraft, 
the risk of which has been assumed by the Government under this clause 
and for which the Contractor has been compensated by the Government, it 
shall equitably reimburse the Government.
    (2) The Contractor shall do nothing to prejudice the Government's 
rights to recover against third parties for any such damage, loss, or 
destruction and, upon the request of the Contracting Officer, shall at 
the Government's expense furnish to the Government all reasonable 
assistance and cooperation (including the prosecution of suits and the 
execution of instruments of assignment or subrogation in favor of the 
Government) in obtaining recovery.

Reimbursement, Time-and-Materials, or Labor-Hour Contracts) clause of 
this contract or under paragraph (a) of this clause, an equitable 
adjustment for any resulting repair, restoration, or replacement

    As prescribed in 1828.371 (b) and (e), insert the following clause:

     Cross-Waiver of Liability for Space Shuttle Services (SEP 1993)

    (a) As prescribed by regulation (14 CFR part 1266), NASA agreements 
involving Space Shuttle flights are required to contain broad cross-
waivers of liability among the parties and the parties related entities 
to encourage participation in space exploration, use, and investment. 
The purpose of this clause is to extend this cross-waiver requirement to 
Contractors and related entities under their contracts. This cross-
waiver of liability shall be broadly construed to achieve the objective 
of encouraging participation in space activities.
    (b) As used in this clause, the term:
    (1) Contractors and Subcontractors include suppliers of any kind.
    (2) Damage means:
    (i) Bodily injury to, or other impairment of health of, or death of, 
any person;

Space Shuttle; and
    (5) Protected Space Operations means all Space Shuttle and payload 
activities on Earth, in outer space, or in transit between Earth and 
outer space performed in furtherance of an agreement involving Space 
Shuttle services or performed under this contract. ``Protected Space 
Operations'' excludes activities on Earth which are conducted on return 
from space to develop further a payload's product or process except when 
such development is for Space Shuttle-related activities necessary to 
implement an agreement involving Space Shuttle services or to perform 
this contract. It includes, but is not limited to:
    (i) Research, design, development, test, manufacture, assembly, 
integration, operation, or use of the Space Shuttle, transfer vehicles, 
payloads, related support equipment, and facilities and services;
    (ii) All activities related to ground support, test, training,

which the Contractor waives all claims against any of the entities or 
persons listed in paragraph (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iii) of this clause 
based on damage arising out of Protected Space Operations. This waiver 
shall apply only if the person, entity, or property causing the damage 
is involved in Protected Space Operations and the person, entity, or 
property damaged is damaged by virtue of its involvement in Protected 
Space Operations. This waiver shall apply to any claims for damage, 
whatever the legal basis for such claims, including but not limited to 
delict (a term used in civil law countries to denote a class of cases 
similar to tort) and tort (including negligence of every degree and 
kind) and contract, against:
    (i) Any party other than the Government;
    (ii) A related entity of any party other than the Government; and
    (iii) The employees of any of the entities identified in (c)(1)(i) 
and (c)(1)(ii) of this clause.
    (2) The Contractor agrees to extend the waiver of liability as set 
forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause to subcontractors at any tier 
by requiring them, by contract or otherwise, to agree to waive all 
claims against the entities or persons identified in paragraphs 
(c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iii) of this clause.
    (3) For avoidance of doubt, this cross-waiver includes a cross-
waiver of liability arising from the Convention on International 
Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, (March 29, 1972, 24 United 
States Treaties and other International Agreements (U.S.T.) 2389,

between the Government's related entities (e.g., claims between the 
Government and the Contractor are included within this exception);
    (ii) Claims made by a natural person, his/her estate, survivors, or 
subrogees for injury or death of such natural person;
    (iii) Claims for damage caused by willful misconduct; and
    (iv) Intellectual property claims.

    The Contractor shall obtain and maintain insurance coverage as 
follows for the performance of this contract:
    (a) Worker's compensation and employer's liability insurance as 
required by applicable Federal and state workers' compensation and 
occupational disease statutes. If occupational diseases are not 
compensable under those statutes, they shall be covered under the 
employer's liability section of the insurance policy, except when 
contract operations are so commingled with the Contractor's commercial 
operations that it would not be practical. The employer's liability 
coverage shall be at least $100,000, except in States with exclusive or 
monopolistic funds that do not permit workers' compensation to be 
written by private carriers.
    (b) Comprehensive general (bodily injury) liability insurance of at 
least $500,000 per occurrence.
    (c) Motor vehicle liability insurance written on the comprehensive 
form of policy which provides for bodily injury and property damage 
liability covering the operation of all motor vehicles used in 
connection with performing the contract. Policies covering motor 
vehicles operated in the United States shall provide coverage of at 
least $200,000 per person and $500,000 per occurrence for bodily injury 
liability and $20,000 per occurrence for property damage. The amount of 
liability

[[Page 303]]

coverage on other policies shall be commensurate with any legal 
requirements of the locality and sufficient to meet normal and customary 
claims.
    (d) Comprehensive general and motor vehicle liability policies shall 
contain a provision worded as follows:
    ``The insurance company waives any right of subrogation against the 
United States of America which may arise by reason of any payment under 
the policy.''
    (e) When aircraft are used in connection with performing the 
contract, aircraft public and passenger liability insurance of at least 
$200,000 per person and $500,000 per occurrence for bodily injury, other 
than passenger liability, and $200,000 per occurrence for property 
damage. Coverage for passenger liability bodily injury shall be at least 
$200,000 multiplied by the number of seats or passengers, whichever is 
greater.

Contracting officers are authorized, in appropriate cases, to revise 
clause paragraphs (a), (b), and (g) to specify the work required under

may be varied from 30 to 90 days, and the 75 percent from 75 to 85 
percent:

          Limitation of Funds (Fixed-Price Contract) (MAR 1989)

    (a) Of the total price of items ---- through ----, the sum of $---- 
is presently available for payment and allotted to this contract. It is 
anticipated that from time to time additional funds will be allocated to 
the contract in accordance with the following schedule, until the total 
price of said items is allotted:

                     Schedule for Allotment of Funds

Date Amounts

    (b) The Contractor agrees to perform or have performed work on the 
items specified in paragraph (a) of this clause up to the point at 
which, if this contract is terminated pursuant to the Termination for 
Convenience of the Government clause of this contract, the total amount 
payable by the Government (including amounts payable for subcontracts 
and settlement costs) pursuant to paragraphs (f) and (g) of that clause 
would, in the exercise of reasonable judgment by the Contractor, 
approximate the total amount at the time allotted to the contract. The 
Contractor is not obligated to continue performance of the work beyond 
that point. The Government is not obligated in any event to pay or 
reimburse the Contractor more than the amount from time to time allotted 
to the contract, anything to the contrary in the Termination for 
Convenience of the Government clause notwithstanding.
    (c) (1) It is contemplated that funds presently allotted to this 
contract will cover the work to be performed until ----.
    (2) If funds allotted are considered by the Contractor to be 
inadequate to cover the work to be performed until that date, or an 
agreed date substituted for it, the Contractor shall notify the 
Contracting Officer in writing when within the next 60 days the work 
will reach a point at which, if the contract is terminated pursuant to 
the Termination for Convenience of the Government clause of this 
contract, the total amount payable by the Government (including amounts 
payable for subcontracts and settlement costs) pursuant to paragraphs 
(f) and (g) of that clause will approximate 75 percent

[[Page 308]]

of the total amount then allotted to the contract.
    (3) (i) The notice shall state the estimated date when the point 
referred to in paragraph (c)(2) of this clause will be reached and the 
estimated amount of additional funds required to continue performance to 
the date specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause, or an agreed date 
substituted for it.
    (ii) The Contractor shall, 60 days in advance of the date specified 
in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause, or an agreed date substituted for 
it, advise the Contracting Officer in writing as to the estimated amount 
of additional funds required for the timely performance of the contract 
for a further period as may be specified in the contract or otherwise 
agreed to by the parties.
    (4) If, after the notification referred to in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) 
of this clause, additional funds are not allotted by the date specified 
in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause, or an agreed date substituted for 
it, the Contracting Officer shall, upon the Contractor's written 
request, terminate this contract on that date or on the date set forth 
in the request, whichever is later, pursuant to the Termination for 
Convenience of the Government clause.
    (d) When additional funds are allotted from time to time for 
continued performance of the work under this contract, the parties shall 
agree on the applicable period of contract performance to be covered by 
these funds. The provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this clause 
shall apply to these additional allotted funds and the substituted date 
pertaining to them, and the contract shall be modified accordingly.
    (e) If, solely by reason of the Government's failure to allot 
additional funds in amounts sufficient for the timely performance of 
this contract, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in 
the performance of the work under this contract, and if additional funds 
are allotted, an equitable adjustment shall be made in the price or 
prices (including appropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices where 
applicable) of the items to be delivered, or in the time of delivery, or 
both.
    (f) The Government may at any time before termination, and, with the 
consent of the Contractor, after notice of termination, allot additional 
funds for this contract.
    (g) The provisions of this clause with respect to termination shall 
in no way be deemed to limit the rights of the Government under the 
default clause of this contract. The provisions of this Limitation of 
Funds clause are limited to the work on and allotment of funds for the 
items set forth in paragraph (a). This clause shall become inoperative 
upon the allotment of funds for the total price of said work except for 
rights and obligations then existing under this clause.
    (h) Nothing in this clause shall affect the right of the Government 
to terminate this contract pursuant to the Termination for Convenience 
of the Government clause of this contract.

Sec. 1852.235-72  Instructions for responding to NASA Research

    As prescribed in 1835.070(c), insert the following provision:

  Instructions for Responding to NASA Research Announcements (DEC 2005)

    (a) General.
    (1) Proposals received in response to a NASA Research Announcement 
(NRA) will be used only for evaluation purposes. NASA does not allow a 
proposal, the contents of which are not available without restriction 
from another source, or any unique ideas submitted in response to an NRA 
to be used as the basis of a solicitation or in negotiation with other 
organizations, nor is a pre-award synopsis published for individual 
proposals.
    (2) A solicited proposal that results in a NASA award becomes part 
of the record of that transaction and may be available to the public on 
specific request; however, information or material that NASA and the 
awardee mutually agree to be of a privileged nature will be held in 
confidence to the extent permitted by law, including the Freedom of 
Information Act.

[[Page 310]]

    (3) NRAs contain programmatic information and certain requirements 
which apply only to proposals prepared in response to that particular 
announcement. These instructions contain the general proposal 
preparation information which applies to responses to all NRAs.
    (4) A contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other agreement may 
be used to accomplish an effort funded in response to an NRA. NASA will 
determine the appropriate award instrument. Contracts resulting from 
NRAs are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the NASA FAR 
Supplement. Any proposal from a large business concern that may result 
in the award of a contract, which exceeds $5,000,000 and has 
subcontracting possibilities should include a small business 
subcontracting plan in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.219-9, Small 
Business Subcontracting Plan. (Subcontract plans for contract awards 
below $5,000,000, will be negotiated after selection.) Any resultant 
grants or cooperative agreements will be awarded and administered in 
accordance with the NASA Grant and Cooperative Agreement Handbook (NPR 
5800.1).
    (5) NASA does not have mandatory forms or formats for responses to 
NRAs; however, it is requested that proposals conform to the guidelines 
in these instructions. NASA may accept proposals without discussion; 
hence, proposals should initially be as complete as possible and be 
submitted on the proposers' most favorable terms.
    (6) To be considered for award, a submission must, at a minimum, 
present a specific project within the areas delineated by the NRA; 
contain sufficient technical and cost information to permit a meaningful 
evaluation; be signed by an official authorized to legally bind the 
submitting organization; not merely offer to perform standard services 
or to just provide computer facilities or services; and not 
significantly duplicate a more specific current or pending NASA 
solicitation.
    (b) NRA-Specific Items. Several proposal submission items appear in 
the NRA itself: the unique NRA identifier; when to submit proposals; 
where to send proposals; number of copies required; and sources for more 
information. Items included in these instructions may be supplemented by 
the NRA.
    (c) The following information is needed to permit consideration in 
an objective manner. NRAs will generally specify topics for which 
additional information or greater detail is desirable. Each proposal 
copy shall contain all submitted material, including a copy of the 
transmittal letter if it contains substantive information.
    (1) Transmittal Letter or Prefatory Material.
    (i) The legal name and address of the organization and specific 
division or campus identification if part of a larger organization;
    (ii) A brief, scientifically valid project title intelligible to a 
scientifically literate reader and suitable for use in the public press;
    (iii) Type of organization: e.g., profit, nonprofit, educational, 
small business, minority, women-owned, etc;
    (iv) Name and telephone number of the principal investigator and 
business personnel who may be contacted during evaluation or 
negotiation;
    (v) Identification of other organizations that are currently 
evaluating a proposal for the same efforts;
    (vi) Identification of the NRA, by number and title, to which the 
proposal is responding;
    (vii) Dollar amount requested, desired starting date, and duration 
of project;
    (viii) Date of submission; and
    (ix) Signature of a responsible official or authorized 
representative of the organization, or any other person authorized to 
legally bind the organization (unless the signature appears on the 
proposal itself).
    (2) Restriction on Use and Disclosure of Proposal Information. 
Information contained in proposals is used for evaluation purposes only. 
Offerors or quoters should, in order to maximize protection of trade 
secrets or other information that is confidential or privileged, place 
the following notice on the title page of the proposal and specify the 
information subject to the notice by inserting an appropriate 
identification in the notice. In any event, information contained in 
proposals will be protected to the extent permitted by law, but NASA 
assumes no liability for use and disclosure of information not made 
subject to the notice.

    Notice--Restriction on Use and Disclosure of Proposal Information

    The information (data) contained in [insert page numbers or other 
identification] of this proposal constitutes a trade secret and/or 
information that is commercial or financial and confidential or 
privileged. It is furnished to the Government in confidence with the 
understanding that it will not, without permission of the offeror, be 
used or disclosed other than for evaluation purposes; provided, however, 
that in the event a contract (or other agreement) is awarded on the 
basis of this proposal the Government shall have the right to use and 
disclose this information (data) to the extent provided in the contract 
(or other agreement). This restriction does not limit the Government's 
right to use or disclose this information (data) if obtained from 
another source without restriction.
    (3) Abstract. Include a concise (200-300 word if not otherwise 
specified in the NRA) abstract describing the objective and the method 
of approach.
    (4) Project Description.

[[Page 311]]

    (i) The main body of the proposal shall be a detailed statement of 
the work to be undertaken and should include objectives and expected 
significance; relation to the present state of knowledge; and relation 
to previous work done on the project and to related work in progress 
elsewhere. The statement should outline the plan of work, including the 
broad design of experiments to be undertaken and a description of 
experimental methods and procedures. The project description should 
address the evaluation factors in these instructions and any specific 
factors in the NRA. Any substantial collaboration with individuals not 
referred to in the budget or use of consultants should be described. 
Subcontracting significant portions of a research project is 
discouraged.
    (ii) When it is expected that the effort will require more than one 
year, the proposal should cover the complete project to the extent that 
it can be reasonably anticipated. Principal emphasis should be on the 
first year of work, and the description should distinguish clearly 
between the first year's work and work planned for subsequent years.
    (5) Management Approach. For large or complex efforts involving 
interactions among numerous individuals or other organizations, plans 
for distribution of responsibilities and arrangements for ensuring a 
coordinated effort should be described.
    (6) Personnel. The principal investigator is responsible for 
supervision of the work and participates in the conduct of the research 
regardless of whether or not compensated under the award. A short 
biographical sketch of the principal investigator, a list of principal 
publications and any exceptional qualifications should be included. Omit 
social security number and other personal items which do not merit 
consideration in evaluation of the proposal. Give similar biographical 
information on other senior professional personnel who will be directly 
associated with the project. Give the names and titles of any other 
scientists and technical personnel associated substantially with the 
project in an advisory capacity. Universities should list the 
approximate number of students or other assistants, together with 
information as to their level of academic attainment. Any special 
industry-university cooperative arrangements should be described.
    (7) Facilities and Equipment.
    (i) Describe available facilities and major items of equipment 
especially adapted or suited to the proposed project, and any additional 
major equipment that will be required. Identify any Government-owned 
facilities, industrial plant equipment, or special tooling that are 
proposed for use. Include evidence of its availability and the cognizant 
Government points of contact.
    (ii) Before requesting a major item of capital equipment, the 
proposer should determine if sharing or loan of equipment already within 
the organization is a feasible alternative. Where such arrangements 
cannot be made, the proposal should so state. The need for items that 
typically can be used for research and non-research purposes should be 
explained.
    (8) Proposed Costs (U.S. Proposals Only).
    (i) Proposals should contain cost and technical parts in one volume: 
do not use separate ``confidential'' salary pages. As applicable, 
include separate cost estimates for salaries and wages; fringe benefits; 
equipment; expendable materials and supplies; services; domestic and 
foreign travel; ADP expenses; publication or page charges; consultants; 
subcontracts; other miscellaneous identifiable direct costs; and 
indirect costs. List salaries and wages in appropriate organizational 
categories (e.g., principal investigator, other scientific and 
engineering professionals, graduate students, research assistants, and 
technicians and other non-professional personnel). Estimate all staffing 
data in terms of staff-months or fractions of full-time.
    (ii) Explanatory notes should accompany the cost proposal to provide 
identification and estimated cost of major capital equipment items to be 
acquired; purpose and estimated number and lengths of trips planned; 
basis for indirect cost computation (including date of most recent 
negotiation and cognizant agency); and clarification of other items in 
the cost proposal that are not self-evident. List estimated expenses as 
yearly requirements by major work phases.
    (iii) Allowable costs are governed by FAR Part 31 and the NASA FAR 
Supplement Part 1831 (and OMB Circulars A-21 for educational 
institutions and A-122 for nonprofit organizations).
    (iv) Use of NASA funds--NASA funding may not be used for foreign 
research efforts at any level, whether as a collaborator or a 
subcontract. The direct purchase of supplies and/or services, which do 
not constitute research, from non-U.S. sources by U.S award recipients 
is permitted. Additionally, in accordance with the National Space 
Transportation Policy, use of a non-U.S. manufactured launch vehicle is 
permitted only on a no-exchange-of-funds basis.
    (9) Security. Proposals should not contain security classified 
material. If the research requires access to or may generate security 
classified information, the submitter will be required to comply with 
Government security regulations.
    (10) Current Support. For other current projects being conducted by 
the principal investigator, provide title of project, sponsoring agency, 
and ending date.
    (11) Special Matters.
    (i) Include any required statements of environmental impact of the 
research, human subject or animal care provisions, conflict of

[[Page 312]]

interest, or on such other topics as may be required by the nature of 
the effort and current statutes, executive orders, or other current 
Government-wide guidelines.
    (ii) Identify and discuss risk factors and issues throughout the 
proposal where they are relevant, and your approach to managing these 
risks.
    (iii) Proposers should include a brief description of the 
organization, its facilities, and previous work experience in the field 
of the proposal. Identify the cognizant Government audit agency, 
inspection agency, and administrative contracting officer, when 
applicable.
    (d) Renewal Proposals.
    (1) Renewal proposals for existing awards will be considered in the 
same manner as proposals for new endeavors. A renewal proposal should 
not repeat all of the information that was in the original proposal. The 
renewal proposal should refer to its predecessor, update the parts that 
are no longer current, and indicate what elements of the research are 
expected to be covered during the period for which support is desired. A 
description of any significant findings since the most recent progress 
report should be included. The renewal proposal should treat, in 
reasonable detail, the plans for the next period, contain a cost 
estimate, and otherwise adhere to these instructions.
    (2) NASA may renew an effort either through amendment of an existing 
contract or by a new award.
    (e) Length. Unless otherwise specified in the NRA, effort should be 
made to keep proposals as brief as possible, concentrating on 
substantive material. Few proposals need exceed 15-20 pages. Necessary 
detailed information, such as reprints, should be included as 
attachments. A complete set of attachments is necessary for each copy of 
the proposal. As proposals are not returned, avoid use of ``one-of-a-
kind'' attachments.
    (f) Joint Proposals.
    (1) Where multiple organizations are involved, the proposal may be 
submitted by only one of them. It should clearly describe the role to be 
played by the other organizations and indicate the legal and managerial 
arrangements contemplated. In other instances, simultaneous submission 
of related proposals from each organization might be appropriate, in 
which case parallel awards would be made.
    (2) Where a project of a cooperative nature with NASA is 
contemplated, describe the contributions expected from any participating 
NASA investigator and agency facilities or equipment which may be 
required. The proposal must be confined only to that which the proposing 
organization can commit itself. ``Joint'' proposals which specify the 
internal arrangements NASA will actually make are not acceptable as a 
means of establishing an agency commitment.
    (g) Late Proposals. Proposals or proposal modifications received 
after the latest date specified for receipt may be considered if a 
significant reduction in cost to the Government is probable or if there 
are significant technical advantages, as compared with proposals 
previously received.
    (h) Withdrawal. Proposals may be withdrawn by the proposer at any 
time before award. Offerors are requested to notify NASA if the proposal 
is funded by another organization or of other changed circumstances 
which dictate termination of evaluation.
    (i) Evaluation Factors
    (1) Unless otherwise specified in the NRA, the principal elements 
(of approximately equal weight) considered in evaluating a proposal are 
its relevance to NASA's objectives, intrinsic merit, and cost.
    (2) Evaluation of a proposal's relevance to NASA's objectives 
includes the consideration of the potential contribution of the effort 
to NASA's mission.
    (3) Evaluation of its intrinsic merit includes the consideration of 
the following factors of equal importance:
    (i) Overall scientific or technical merit of the proposal or unique 
and innovative methods, approaches, or concepts demonstrated by the 
proposal.
    (ii) Offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, 
techniques, or unique combinations of these which are integral factors 
for achieving the proposal objectives.
    (iii) The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the 
proposed principal investigator, team leader, or key personnel critical 
in achieving the proposal objectives.
    (iv) Overall standing among similar proposals and/or evaluation 
against the state-of-the-art.
    (4) Evaluation of the cost of a proposed effort may include the 
realism and reasonableness of the proposed cost and available funds.
    (j) Evaluation Techniques. Selection decisions will be made 
following peer and/or scientific review of the proposals. Several 
evaluation techniques are regularly used within NASA. In all cases 
proposals are subject to scientific review by discipline specialists in 
the area of the proposal. Some proposals are reviewed entirely in-house, 
others are evaluated by a combination of in-house and selected external 
reviewers, while yet others are subject to the full external peer review 
technique (with due regard for conflict-of-interest and protection of 
proposal information), such as by mail or through assembled panels. The 
final decisions are made by a NASA selecting official. A proposal which 
is scientifically and programmatically meritorious, but not selected for 
award during its initial review, may be included in subsequent reviews 
unless the proposer requests otherwise.
    (k) Selection for Award.

[[Page 313]]

    (1) When a proposal is not selected for award, the proposer will be 
notified. NASA will explain generally why the proposal was not selected. 
Proposers desiring additional information may contact the selecting 
official who will arrange a debriefing.
    (2) When a proposal is selected for award, negotiation and award 
will be handled by the procurement office in the funding installation. 
The proposal is used as the basis for negotiation. The contracting 
officer may request certain business data and may forward a model award 
instrument and other information pertinent to negotiation.
    (l) Additional Guidelines Applicable to Foreign Proposals and 
Proposals Including Foreign Participation
    (1) NASA welcomes proposals from outside the U.S. However, foreign 
entities are generally not eligible for funding from NASA. Therefore, 
unless otherwise noted in the NRA, proposals from foreign entities 
should not include a cost plan unless the proposal involves 
collaboration with a U.S. institution, in which case a cost plan for 
only the participation of the U.S. entity must be included. Proposals 
from foreign entities and proposals from U.S. entities that include 
foreign participation must be endorsed by the respective government 
agency or funding/sponsoring institution in the country from which the 
foreign entity is proposing. Such endorsement should indicate that the 
proposal merits careful consideration by NASA, and if the proposal is 
selected, sufficient funds will be made available to undertake the 
activity as proposed.
    (2) All foreign proposals must be typewritten in English and comply 
with all other submission requirements stated in the NRA. All foreign 
proposals will undergo the same evaluation and selection process as 
those originating in the U.S. All proposals must be received before the 
established closing date. Those received after the closing date will be 
treated in accordance with paragraph (g) of this provision. Sponsoring 
foreign government agencies or funding institutions may, in exceptional 
situations, forward a proposal without endorsement if endorsement is not 
possible before the announced closing date. In such cases, the NASA 
sponsoring office should be advised when a decision on endorsement can 
be expected.
    (3) Successful and unsuccessful foreign entities will be contacted 
directly by the NASA sponsoring office. Copies of these letters will be 
sent to the foreign sponsor. Should a foreign proposal or a U.S. 
proposal with foreign participation be selected, NASA's Office of 
External Relations will arrange with the foreign sponsor for the 
proposed participation on a no-exchange-of-funds basis, in which NASA 
and the non-U.S. sponsoring agency or funding institution will each bear 
the cost of discharging their respective responsibilities.
    (4) Depending on the nature and extent of the proposed cooperation, 
these arrangements may entail:
    (i) An exchange of letters between NASA and the foreign sponsor; or
    (ii) A formal Agency-to-Agency Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).
    (m) Cancellation of NRA. NASA reserves the right to make no awards 
under this NRA and to cancel this NRA. NASA assumes no liability for 
canceling the NRA or for anyone's failure to receive actual notice of 
cancellation.

complying with such restrictive markings. Should the Contractor seek to 
publish or otherwise disseminate the final report, or any additional 
reports required by 1852.235-74 if applicable, as delivered to NASA 
under this contract, the Contractor may do so once NASA has completed 
its document availability authorization review, and availability of the 
report has been determined.

                         Alternate I (FEB 2003)

    As prescribed by 1835.070(d)(1), insert the following as paragraph 
(e) of the basic clause:

    (e) The data resulting from this research activity is ``fundamental 
research'' which will be broadly shared within the scientific community. 
No foreign national access or dissemination restrictions apply to this 
research activity. The Contractor may publish, release, or otherwise 
disseminate data produced during the performance of this contract, 
including the final report, without prior review by NASA for export 
control or national security purposes. However, NASA retains the right 
to review the final report to ensure that proprietary information, which 
may have been provided to the Contractor, is not released without 
authorization and for consistency with NASA publication standards. 
Additionally, the Contractor is responsible for reviewing any 
publication, release, or dissemination of the data for conformance with 
other restrictions expressly set forth in this contract, and to the 
extent it receives or is given access to data necessary for the 
performance of the contract which contain restrictive markings, for 
compliance with such restrictive markings.

                         Alternate II (DEC 2005)

availability of the data has been determined.
    (f) All publications of any material based on or developed under 
NASA sponsored projects shall include an acknowledgement similar to the 
following:

    ``The material is based upon work supported by the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration under Contract Number XXXX.''

    Except for articles or papers published in scientific, technical or 
professional journals, the exposition of results from NASA supported 
research shall also include the following disclaimer:

    ``Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations 
expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not 
necessarily reflect the views of the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration.''

                        Alternate III (JAN 2005)

    As prescribed by 1835.070(d)(3), insert the following as paragraph 
(e) of the basic clause:

    (e) The Contractor's rights in data are defined in FAR 52.227-20, 
Rights In Data--SBIR Program. The Contractor may publish, or otherwise

Sec. 1852.235-74  Additional Reports of Work--Research and Development.

    As prescribed in 1835.070(e), insert a clause substantially the same 
as the following:

     Additional Reports of Work--Research and Development (FEB 2003)

    In addition to the final report required under this contract, the 
Contractor shall submit the following report(s) to the Contracting 
Officer:
    (a) Monthly progress reports. The Contractor shall submit separate 
monthly reports of all work accomplished during each month of contract 
performance. Reports shall be in narrative form, brief, and informal. 
They shall include a quantitative description of progress, an indication 
of any current problems that may impede performance, proposed corrective 
action, and a discussion of the work to be performed during the next 
monthly reporting period.
    (b) Quarterly progress reports. The Contractor shall submit separate 
quarterly reports of all work accomplished during each three-month 
period of contract performance. In addition to factual data, these 
reports should include a separate analysis section interpreting the 
results obtained, recommending further action, and relating occurrences 
to the ultimate objectives of the contract. Sufficient diagrams, 
sketches, curves, photographs, and drawings should be included to convey 
the intended meaning.
    (c) Submission dates. Monthly and quarterly reports shall be 
submitted by the 15th day of the month following the month or quarter 
being reported. If the contract is awarded beyond the middle of a month, 
the first monthly report shall cover the period from award until the end 
of the following month. No monthly report need be submitted for the 
third month of contract effort for which a quarterly report is required. 
No quarterly report need be submitted for the final three months of 
contract effort since that period will be covered in the final report. 
The final report shall be submitted within ---- days after the 
completion of the effort under the contract.

Sec. 1852.236-71  Additive or deductive items.

    As prescribed in 1836.570(a), insert the following provision:

                 Additive or Deductive Items (MAR 1989)

    (a) The low bidder for purposes of award shall be the conforming 
responsible bidder offering the low aggregate amount for the first or 
base bid item, plus or minus (in order of priority listed in the 
Schedule) those additive or deductive bid items providing the most 
features of the work within the funds determined by the Government to be 
available before bids are opened. If addition of another bid item in the 
listed order of priority would make the award exceed those funds for all 
bidders, it shall be skipped and the next subsequent additive bid item 
in a lower amount shall be added for each bid if award on it can be made 
within the funds.
    (b) An example for one bid is an amount available of $100,000, a 
bidder's base bid of $85,000, and four successive additives of $10,000, 
$8,000, $6,000, and $4,000. In this example, the aggregate amount of the 
bid for purposes of award would be $99,000 for the base bid plus the 
first and fourth additives, the second and third additives being skipped 
because either of them would cause the aggregate bid to exceed $100,000.
    (c) All bids shall be evaluated on the basis of the same additive or 
deductive bid items. The listed order of priority must be followed only 
for determining the low bidder. After determination of the low bidder, 
award in the best interests of the Government may be made to that bidder 
on its base bid and any combination of its additive or deductive bid 
items for which funds are determined to be available at the time of the 
award, provided that award of the combination of bid items does not 
exceed the amount offered by any other conforming responsible bidder for 
the same combination of bid items.

                    Bids With Unit Prices (MAR 1989)

    (a) All extensions of the unit prices bid will be subject to 
verification by the Government. If there is variation between the unit 
price and any extended amounts, the unit price will be considered to be 
the bid.
    (b) If a modification to a bid based on unit prices that provides 
for a lump-sum adjustment to the total estimated cost is submitted, the 
application of the lump sum adjustment to each unit price in the bid 
must be stated. If it is not stated, the lump-sum adjustment shall be 
applied on a pro rata basis to every unit price in the bid.

Sec. 1852.236-75  Partnering for construction contracts.

    As prescribed in 1836.7004, insert the following clause:

            Partnering for Construction Contracts (AUG 1998)

    (a) The terms ``partnering'' and ``partnership'' used herein shall 
mean a relationship of open communication and close cooperation that 
involves both Government and Contractor personnel working together for 
the purpose of establishing a mutually beneficial, proactive, 
cooperative environment within which to achieve contract objectives and 
resolve issues and implementing actions as required.
    (b) Partnering will be a voluntary commitment mutually agreed upon 
by at least NASA and the prime contractor, and preferably the 
subcontractors and the A&E design contractor, if applicable. Sustained 
commitment to the process is essential to assure success of the 
relationship.
    (c) NASA intends to facilitate contract management by encouraging 
the foundation of a cohesive partnership with the Contractor, its 
subcontractors, the A&E design contractor, and NASA's contract 
management staff. This partnership will be structured to draw on the 
strengths of each organization to identify and achieve mutual 
objectives. The objectives are intended to complete the contract 
requirements within budget, on schedule, and in accordance with the 
plans and specifications.
    (d) To implement the partnership, it is anticipated that within 30 
days of the Notice to Proceed the prime Contractor's key personnel, its 
subcontractors, the A&E design contractor, and NASA personnel will 
attend a partnership development and team building workshop. Follow-up 
team building workshops will be held periodically throughout the 
duration of the contract as agreed to by the Government and the 
Contractor.
    (e) Any cost with effectuating the partnership will be agreed to in 
advance by both parties and will be shared with no change in the 
contract price. The contractor's share of the costs are not recoverable 
under any other Government award.

                     Pension Portability (JAN 1997)

    (a) In order for pension costs attributable to employees assigned to 
this contract to be allowable costs under this contract, the plans 
covering such employees must:
    (1) Comply with all applicable Government laws and regulations;
    (2) Be a defined contribution plan, or a multiparty defined benefit 
plan operated under a collective bargaining agreement. In either case, 
the plan must be portable, i.e., the plan follows the employee, not the 
employer;
    (3) Provide for 100 percent employee vesting at the earlier of one 
year of continuous employee service or contract termination; and
    (4) Not be modified, terminated, or a new plan adopted without the 
prior written approval of the cognizant NASA Contracting Officer.
    (b) The Contractor shall include paragraph (a) of this clause in 
subcontracts for continuing services under a service contract if:
    (1) The prime contract requires pension portability;
    (2) The subcontracted labor dollars (excluding any burdens or

Sec. 1852.237-72  Access to Sensitive Information.

    As prescribed in 1837.203-72(a), insert the following clause:

               Access to Sensitive Information (JUN 2005)

    (a) As used in this clause, ``sensitive information'' refers to 
information that a contractor has developed at private expense, or that 
the Government has generated that qualifies for an exception to the 
Freedom of Information Act, which is not currently in the public domain, 
and which may embody trade secrets or commercial or financial 
information, and which may be sensitive or privileged.
    (b) To assist NASA in accomplishing management activities and 
administrative functions, the Contractor shall provide the services 
specified elsewhere in this contract.
    (c) If performing this contract entails access to sensitive 
information, as defined above, the Contractor agrees to--
    (1) Utilize any sensitive information coming into its possession 
only for the purposes of performing the services specified in this 
contract, and not to improve its own competitive position in another 
procurement.
    (2) Safeguard sensitive information coming into its possession from 
unauthorized use and disclosure.
    (3) Allow access to sensitive information only to those employees 
that need it to perform services under this contract.
    (4) Preclude access and disclosure of sensitive information to 
persons and entities outside of the Contractor's organization.
    (5) Train employees who may require access to sensitive information 
about their obligations to utilize it only to perform the services 
specified in this contract and to safeguard it from unauthorized use and 
disclosure.
    (6) Obtain a written affirmation from each employee that he/she has 
received and will comply with training on the authorized uses and 
mandatory protections of sensitive information needed in performing this 
contract.
    (7) Administer a monitoring process to ensure that employees comply 
with all reasonable security procedures, report any breaches to the 
Contracting Officer, and implement any necessary corrective actions.
    (d) The Contractor will comply with all procedures and obligations 
specified in its Organizational Conflicts of Interest Avoidance Plan, 
which this contract incorporates as a compliance document.

[[Page 318]]

    (e) The nature of the work on this contract may subject the 
Contractor and its employees to a variety of laws and regulations 
relating to ethics, conflicts of interest, corruption, and other 
criminal or civil matters relating to the award and administration of 
government contracts. Recognizing that this contract establishes a high 
standard of accountability and trust, the Government will carefully 
review the Contractor's performance in relation to the mandates and 
restrictions found in these laws and regulations. Unauthorized uses or 
disclosures of sensitive information may result in termination of this 
contract for default, or in debarment of the Contractor for serious 
misconduct affecting present responsibility as a government contractor.
    (f) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, 
including this paragraph (f), suitably modified to reflect the 
relationship of the parties, in all subcontracts that may involve access 
to sensitive information

Sec. 1852.237-73  Release of sensitive information.

    As prescribed in 1837.203-72(b), insert the following clause:

               Release of Sensitive Information (JUN 2005)

    (a) As used in this clause, ``sensitive information'' refers to 
information, not currently in the public domain, that the Contractor has 
developed at private expense, that may embody trade secrets or 
commercial or financial information, and that may be sensitive or 
privileged.
    (b) In accomplishing management activities and administrative 
functions, NASA relies heavily on the support of various service 
providers. To support NASA activities and functions, these service 
providers, as well as their subcontractors and their individual 
employees, may need access to sensitive information submitted by the 
Contractor under this contract. By submitting this proposal or 
performing this contract, the Contractor agrees that NASA may release to 
its service providers, their subcontractors, and their individual 
employees, sensitive information submitted during the course of this 
procurement, subject to the enumerated protections mandated by the 
clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information.
    (c)(1) The Contractor shall identify any sensitive information 
submitted in support of this proposal or in performing this contract. 
For purposes of identifying sensitive information, the Contractor may, 
in addition to any other notice or legend otherwise required, use a 
notice similar to the following:
    Mark the title page with the following legend:
    This proposal or document includes sensitive information that NASA 
shall not disclose outside the Agency and its service providers that 
support management activities and administrative functions. To gain 
access to this sensitive information, a service provider's contract must 
contain the clause at NFS 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. 
Consistent with this clause, the service provider shall not duplicate, 
use, or disclose the information in whole or in part for any purpose 
other than to perform the services specified in its contract. This 
restriction does not limit the Government's right to use this 
information if it is obtained from another source without restriction. 
The information subject to this restriction is contained in pages 
[insert page numbers or other identification of pages].
    Mark each page of sensitive information the Contractor wishes to 
restrict with the following legend:
    Use or disclosure of sensitive information contained on this page is 
subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal or 
document.
    (2) The Contracting Officer shall evaluate the facts supporting any 
claim that particular information is ``sensitive.'' This evaluation 
shall consider the time and resources necessary to protect the 
information in accordance with the detailed safeguards mandated by the 
clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. However, unless 
the Contracting Officer decides, with the advice of Center counsel, that 
reasonable grounds exist to challenge the Contractor's claim that 
particular information is sensitive, NASA and its service providers and 
their employees shall comply with all of the safeguards contained in 
paragraph (d) of this clause.
    (d) To receive access to sensitive information needed to assist NASA 
in accomplishing management activities and administrative functions, the 
service provider must be operating under a contract that contains the 
clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. This clause 
obligates the service provider to do the following:
    (1) Comply with all specified procedures and obligations, including 
the Organizational Conflicts of Interest Avoidance Plan, which the 
contract has incorporated as a compliance document.
    (2) Utilize any sensitive information coming into its possession 
only for the purpose of performing the services specified in its 
contract.
    (3) Safeguard sensitive information coming into its possession from 
unauthorized use and disclosure.

[[Page 319]]

    (4) Allow access to sensitive information only to those employees 
that need it to perform services under its contract.
    (5) Preclude access and disclosure of sensitive information to 
persons and entities outside of the service provider's organization.
    (6) Train employees who may require access to sensitive information 
about their obligations to utilize it only to perform the services 
specified in its contract and to safeguard it from unauthorized use and 
disclosure.
    (7) Obtain a written affirmation from each employee that he/she has 
received and will comply with training on the authorized uses and 
mandatory protections of sensitive information needed in performing this 
contract.
    (8) Administer a monitoring process to ensure that employees comply 
with all reasonable security procedures, report any breaches to the 
Contracting Officer, and implement any necessary corrective actions.
    (e) When the service provider will have primary responsibility for 
operating an information technology system for NASA that contains 
sensitive information, the service provider's contract shall include the 
clause at 1852.204-76, Security Requirements for Unclassified 
Information Technology Resources. The Security Requirements clause 
requires the service provider to implement an Information Technology 
Security Plan to protect information processed, stored, or transmitted 
from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or use. Service 
provider personnel requiring privileged access or limited privileged 
access to these information technology systems are subject to screening 
using the standard National Agency Check (NAC) forms appropriate to the 
level of risk for adverse impact to NASA missions. The Contracting 
Officer may allow the service provider to conduct its own screening, 
provided the service provider employs substantially equivalent screening 
procedures.
    (f) This clause does not affect NASA's responsibilities under the 
Freedom of Information Act.
    (g) The Contractor shall insert this clause, including this 
paragraph (g), suitably modified to reflect the relationship of the 
parties, in all subcontracts that may require the furnishing of 
sensitive information.

                     Technical Direction (SEP 1993)

    (a) Performance of the work under this contract is subject to the 
written technical direction of the Contracting Officer Technical 
Representative (COTR), who shall be specifically appointed by the 
Contracting Officer in writing in accordance with NASA FAR Supplement 
1842.270. ``Technical direction'' means a directive to the Contractor 
that approves approaches, solutions, designs, or refinements; fills in 
details or otherwise completes the general description of work or 
documentation items; shifts emphasis among work areas or tasks; or 
furnishes similar instruction to the Contractor. Technical direction 
includes requiring studies and pursuit of certain lines of inquiry 
regarding matters within the general tasks and requirements in Section C 
of this contract.
    (b) The COTR does not have the authority to, and shall not, issue 
any instruction purporting to be technical direction that--
    (1) Constitutes an assignment of additional work outside the 
statement of work;
    (2) Constitutes a change as defined in the changes clause;
    (3) Constitutes a basis for any increase or decrease in the total 
estimated contract cost, the fixed fee (if any), or the time required 
for contract performance;
    (4) Changes any of the expressed terms, conditions, or 
specifications of the contract; or
    (5) Interferes with the contractor's rights to perform the terms and 
conditions of the contract.
    (c) All technical direction shall be issued in writing by the COTR.
    (d) The Contractor shall proceed promptly with the performance of 
technical direction duly issued by the COTR in the manner prescribed by 
this clause and within the COTR's authority. If, in the Contractor's 
opinion, any instruction or direction by the COTR falls within any of 
the categories defined in paragraph (b) of this clause, the Contractor 
shall not proceed but shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing 
within 5 working days after receiving it and shall request the 
Contracting Officer to take action as described in this clause. Upon 
receiving this notification, the Contracting Officer shall either issue 
an appropriate contract modification within a reasonable time or advise 
the Contractor in writing within 30 days that the instruction or 
direction is--
    (1) Rescinded in its entirety; or
    (2) Within the requirements of the contract and does not constitute 
a change under the Changes clause of the contract, and that the 
Contractor should proceed promptly with its performance.
    (e) A failure of the Contractor and the Contracting Officer to agree 
that the instruction or direction is both within the requirements of the 
contract and does not constitute a change under the Changes clause, or a 
failure to agree upon the contract action to be taken with respect to 
the instruction or direction, shall be subject to the Disputes clause of 
this contract.
    (f) Any action(s) taken by the contractor in response to any 
direction given by any person other than the Contracting Officer or the 
COTR shall be at the Contractor's risk.

    (e) When the NASA installation grants administrative leave to its 
Government employees (e.g., as a result of inclement weather, 
potentially hazardous conditions, or other special circumstances), 
Contractor personnel working on-site should also be dismissed. However, 
the contractor shall provide sufficient onsite personnel to perform 
round-the-clock requirements of critical work already in process, unless 
otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer or authorized 
representative.
    (f) Whenever administrative leave is granted to Contractor personnel 
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this clause, it shall be without loss to 
the Contractor. The cost of salaries and wages to the Contractor for the 
period of any such excused absence shall be a reimbursable item of cost 
under this contract for employees in accordance with the Contractor's 
established accounting policy.

    (b) As a minimum, these procedures must provide for:
    (1) Establishing the time-phase budgeted cost of work scheduled 
(including work authorization, budgeting, and scheduling), the budgeted 
cost for work performed, the actual cost of work performed, the budget 
at completion, the estimate at completion, and provisions for 
subcontractor performance measurement and reporting;
    (2) Applying all direct and indirect costs and provisions for use 
and control of management reserve and undistributed budget;
    (3) Incorporating changes to the contract budget base for both 
Government directed changes and internal replanning;
    (4) Establishing constraints to preclude subjective adjustment of 
data to ensure performance measurement remains realistic. The total 
allocated budget may exceed the contract budget base only after 
consultation with the Contracting Officer. For cost-reimbursement 
contracts, the contract budget base shall exclude changes for cost 
growth increases, other than for authorized changes to the contract 
scope; and
    (5) Establishing the capability to accurately identify and explain 
significant cost and schedule variances, both on a cumulative basis and 
a projected-at-completion basis.
    (c) The Contractor may use a cost/schedule control system that has 
been recognized by the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer 
(ACO) as:
    (1) Complying with the earned value management system criteria 
provided in NASA Policy Directive 9501.3, Earned Value Management, or 
DoD 5000.2-R, Mandatory Procedures for Major Defense Acquisition 
Programs and Major Automated Information Systems Acquisition Programs; 
or
    (2) Conforming with the full intentions of the guidelines presented 
in ANSI/EIA Standard 748, Industry Guidelines for Earned Value 
Management Systems.
    (d) The Government may require integrated baseline reviews. Such 
reviews shall be scheduled as early as practicable and should be 
conducted within 180 calendar days after contract award, exercise of 
significant contract options, or incorporation of major modifications. 
The objective of the integrated baseline review is for the Government 
and the Contractor to jointly assess areas, such as the Contractor's 
planning, to ensure complete coverage of the statement of work, logical 
scheduling of the work activities, adequate resourcing, and 
identification of inherent risks.
    (e) The Contractor shall provide access to all pertinent records, 
company procedures, and data requested by the ACO, or authorized 
representative, to:
    (1) Show proper implementation of the procedures generating the cost 
and schedule information being used to satisfy the M/CPR contractual 
data requirements to the Government; and
    (2) Ensure continuing application of the accepted company procedures 
in satisfying the M/CPR data item.
    (f) The Contractor shall submit any substantive changes to the 
procedures and their impact to the ACO for review.
    (g) The Contractor shall require a subcontractor to furnish M/CPR in 
each case where the subcontract is other than firm-fixed-price, time-
and-materials, or labor-hour; is 12 months or more in duration; and has 
critical or significant tasks related to the prime contract. Critical or 
significant tasks shall be defined by mutual agreement between the 
Government and Contractor. Each subcontractor's reported cost and 
schedule information shall be incorporated into the Contractor's M/CPR.

Sec. 1852.243-70  Engineering change proposals.

    As prescribed in 1843.205-70(a)(1), insert the following clause, 
modified to suit contract type:

                 Engineering Change Proposals (FEB 1998)

    (a) Definitions.
    ``ECP'' means an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) which is a 
proposed engineering change and the documentation by which the change is 
described, justified, and submitted to the procuring activity for 
approval or disapproval.
    (b) Either party to the contract may originate ECPs. Implementation 
of an approved ECP may occur by either a supplemental agreement or, if 
appropriate, as a written change order to the contract.
    (c) Any ECP submitted to the Contracting Officer shall include a 
``not-to-exceed'' ------ [price or estimated cost] increase or decrease 
adjustment amount, if any, and the required [time of delivery or period 
of performance] adjustment, if any, acceptable to the originator of the 
ECP. If the change is originated within the Government, the Contracting 
Officer shall obtain a written agreement with the Contractor regarding 
the ``not-to-exceed'' ------ [price or estimated cost] and [delivery or 
period of performance] adjustments, if any, prior to issuing an order 
for implementation of the change.
    (d) After submission of a Contractor initiated ECP, the Contracting 
Officer may require the Contractor to submit the following information:
    (1) Cost or pricing data in accordance with FAR 15.403-5 if the 
proposed change meets the criteria for its submission under FAR 15.403-
4; or
    (2) Information other than cost or pricing data adequate for 
Contracting Officer determination of price reasonableness or cost 
realism. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to request 
additional information if that provided by the Contractor is considered 
inadequate for that purpose. If the Contractor claims applicability of 
one of the exceptions to submission of cost or pricing data, it shall 
cite the exception and provide rationale for its applicability.
    (e) If the ECP is initiated by NASA, the Contracting Officer shall 
specify the cost information requirements, if any.

Sec. 1852.243-71  Shared savings.

    As prescribed in 1843.7102, insert the following clause:

                        Shared Savings (MAR 1997)

    (a) The Contractor is entitled, under the provisions of this clause, 
to share in cost savings resulting from the implementation of cost 
reduction projects which are presented to the Government in the form of 
Cost Reduction Proposals (CRP) and approved by the Contracting Officer. 
These cost reduction projects may require changes to the terms, 
conditions or statement of work of this contract. Any cost reduction 
projects must not change the essential function of any products to be 
delivered or the essential purpose of services to be provided under the 
contract.
    (b) Definitions:
    (1) Cost savings, as contemplated by this clause mean savings that 
result from instituting changes to the covered contract, as identified 
in an approved Cost Reduction Proposal.
    (2) Cost Reduction Proposal--For the purposes of this clause, a Cost 
Reduction Proposal means a proposal that recommends alternatives to the 
established procedures and/or organizational support of a contract or 
group of contracts. These alternatives must result in a net reduction of 
contract cost and price to NASA. The proposal will include technical and 
cost information sufficient to enable the Contracting Officer to 
evaluate the CRP and approve or disapprove it.
    (3) Covered contract--As used in this provision, covered contract 
means the contract, including unexercised options but excluding future 
contracts, whether contemplated or not, against which the CRP is 
submitted.
    (4) Contractor implementation costs--As used in this provision, 
Contractor implementation costs, or ``implementation costs'', shall mean 
those costs which the Contractor incurs on covered contracts 
specifically in developing, preparing, submitting, and negotiating a 
CRP, as well as those costs the Contractor will incur on covered 
contracts to make any structural or organizational changes in order to 
implement an approved CRP.
    (5) Government costs--As used in this provision, the term Government 
costs means internal costs of NASA, or any other Government agency, 
which result directly from development and implementation of the CRP. 
These may include, but are not limited to, costs associated with the 
administration of the contract or with such contractually related 
functions such as testing, operations, maintenance and logistics 
support. These costs also include costs associated with other Agency 
contracts (including changes in contract price or cost and fee) that may 
be affected as a result of the implementation of a CRP. They do not 
include the normal administrative costs of reviewing and processing the 
Cost Reduction Proposal.
    (c) General. The Contractor will develop, prepare and submit CRP's 
with supporting information as detailed in paragraph (e) of this clause, 
to the Contracting Officer. The CRP will describe the proposed cost 
reduction activity in sufficient detail to enable the Contracting 
Officer to evaluate it and to approve or disapprove it. The Contractor 
shall share in any net cost savings realized from approved and 
implemented CRPs in accordance with the terms of this clause. The 
Contractor's actual percentage share of the cost savings shall be a 
matter for negotiation with the Contracting Officer, but shall not, in 
any event, exceed 50 percent of the total cost savings recognized by the 
Contracting Officer. The Contractor may propose changes in other 
activities that impact performance on its contract, including Government 
and other Contractor operations, if such changes will optimize cost 
savings. A Contractor shall not be entitled to share, however, in any 
cost savings that are internal to the Government, or which result from 
changes made to any contracts to which it is not a party even if those 
changes were proposed as a part of its CRP. Early communication between 
the Contractor and Government is encouraged. The communication may be in 
the form of a concept paper or preliminary proposal. The Government is 
not committed to accepting any proposal as a result of these early 
discussions.
    (d) Computation of cost savings. The cost savings to be shared 
between the Government and the Contractor will be computed by the 
Contracting Officer by comparing a current estimate to complete (ETC) 
for the covered contract, as structured before implementation of the 
proposed CRP, to a revised ETC which takes into account the 
implementation of that CRP. The cost savings to be shared shall be 
reduced by any cost overrun, whether experienced or projected, that is

[[Page 326]]

identified on the covered contract before implementation of the CRP. 
Although a CRP may result in cost savings that extend far into the 
future, the period in which the Contractor may share in those savings 
will be limited to no more than five years. Implementation costs of the 
Contractor must be considered and specifically identified in the revised 
ETC. The Contracting Officer shall offset Contractor cost savings by any 
increased costs (whether implementing or recurring) to the Government 
when computing the total cost savings to be shared. The Contractor shall 
not be entitled, under the provisions of this clause, to share in any 
cost reductions to the contract that are the result of changes stemming 
from any action other than an approved CRP. However, this clause does 
not limit recovery of any such reimbursements that are allowed as a 
result of other contract provisions.
    (e) Supporting Information. As a minimum, the Contractor shall 
provide the following supporting information with each CRP:
    (1) Identification of the current contract requirements or 
established procedures and/or organizational support which are proposed 
to be changed.
    (2) A description of the difference between the current process or 
procedure and the proposed change. This description shall address how 
proposed changes will meet NASA requirements and discuss the advantages 
and disadvantages of the existing practice and the proposed changes.
    (3) A list of contract requirements which must be revised, if any, 
if the CRP is approved, along with proposed revisions. Any changes to 
NASA or delegated contract management processes should also be 
addressed.
    (4) Detailed cost estimates which reflect the implementation costs 
of the CRP.
    (5) An updated ETC for the covered contract, unchanged, and a 
revised ETC for the covered contract which reflects changes resulting 
from implementing the CRP. If the CRP proposes changes to only a limited 
number of elements of the contract, the ETCs need only address those 
portions of the contract that have been impacted. Each ETC shall depict 
the level of costs incurred or to be incurred by year, or to the level 
of detail required by the Contracting Officer. If other CRPs have been 
proposed or approved on a contract, the impact of these CRPs must be 
addressed in the computation of the cost savings to ensure that the cost 
savings identified are attributable only to the CRP under consideration 
in the instant case.
    (6) Identification of any other previous submissions of the CRP, 
including the dates submitted, the agencies and contracts involved, and 
the disposition of those submittals.
    (f) Administration.
    (1) The Contractor shall submit proposed CRPs to the Contracting 
Officer who shall be responsible for the review, evaluation and 
approval. Normally, CRP's should not be entertained for the first year 
of performance to allow the Contracting Officer to assess performance 
against the basic requirements. If a cost reduction project impacts more 
than a single contract, the Contractor may, upon concurrence of the 
Contracting Officers responsible for the affected contracts, submit a 
single CRP which addresses fully the cost savings projected on all 
affected contracts that contain this Shared Savings Clause. In the case 
of multiple contracts affected, responsibility for the review and 
approval of the CRP will be a matter to be decided by the affected 
Contracting Officers.
    (2) Within 60 days of receipt, the Contracting Officer shall 
complete an initial evaluation of any proposed cost reduction plan to 
determine its feasibility. Failure of the Contracting Officer to provide 
a response within 60 days shall not be construed as approval of the CRP. 
The Government shall promptly notify the Contractor of the results of 
its initial evaluation and indicate what, if any, further action will be 
taken. If the Government determines that the proposed CRP has merit, it 
will open discussions with the Contractor to establish the cost savings 
to be recognized, the Contractor's share of the cost savings, and a 
payment schedule. The Contractor shall continue to perform in accordance 
with the terms and conditions of the existing contract until a contract 
modification is executed by the Contracting Officer. The modification 
shall constitute approval of the CRP and shall incorporate the changes 
identified by the CRP, adjust the contract cost and/or price, establish 
the Contractor's share of cost savings, and incorporate the agreed to 
payment schedule.
    (3) The Contractor will receive payment by submitting invoices to 
the Contracting Officer for approval. The amount and timing of 
individual payments will be made in accordance with the schedule to be 
established with the Contracting Officer. Notwithstanding the overall 
savings recognized by the Contracting Officer as a result of an approved 
CRP, payment of any portion of the Contractor's share of savings shall 
not be made until NASA begins to realize a net cost savings on the 
contract (i.e., implementation, startup and other increased costs 
resulting from the change have been offset by cumulative cost savings). 
Savings associated with unexercised options will not be paid unless and 
until the contract options are exercised. It shall be the responsibility 
of the Contractor to provide such justification as the Contracting 
Officer deems necessary to substantiate that cost savings are being 
achieved.

[[Page 327]]

    (4) Any future activity, including a merger or acquisition 
undertaken by the Contractor (or to which the Contractor becomes an 
involved party), which has the effect of reducing or reversing the cost 
savings realized from an approved CRP for which the Contractor has 
received payment may be cause for recomputing the net cost savings 
associated with any approved CRP. The Government reserves the right to 
make an adjustment to the Contractor's share of cost savings and to 
receive a refund of moneys paid if necessary. Such adjustment shall not 
be made without notifying the Contractor in advance of the intended 
action and affording the Contractor an opportunity for discussion.
    (g) Limitations. Contract requirements that are imposed by statute 
shall not be targeted for cost reduction exercises. The Contractor is 
precluded from receiving reimbursements under both this clause and other 
incentive provisions of the contract, if any, for the same cost 
reductions.
    (h) Disapproval of, or failure to approve, any proposed cost 
reduction proposal shall not be considered a dispute subject to remedies 
under the Disputes clause.
    (i) Cost savings paid to the Contractor in accordance with the 
provisions of this clause do not constitute profit or fee within the 
limitations imposed by 10 U.S.C. 2306(d) and 41 U.S.C. 254(b).

    (a) The provisions of all other clauses contained in this contract 
which provide for an equitable adjustment, including those clauses 
incorporated by reference with the exception of the ``Suspension of 
Work'' clause (FAR 52.242-14), are supplemented as follows:
    Upon written request, the Contractor shall submit a proposal for 
review by the Government. The proposal shall be submitted to the 
contracting officer within the time limit indicated in the request or 
any extension thereto subsequently granted. The proposal shall provide 
an itemized breakdown of all increases and decreases in the contract for 
the Contractor and each subcontractor in at least the following detail: 
material quantities and costs; direct labor hours and rates for each 
trade; the associated FICA, FUTA, SUTA, and Workmen's Compensation 
Insurance; and equipment hours and rates.
    (b) The overhead percentage cited below shall be considered to 
include all indirect costs including, but not limited to, field and 
office supervisors and assistants, incidental job burdens, small tools, 
and general overhead allocations. ``Commission'' is defined as profit on 
work performed by others. The percentages for overhead, profit, and 
commission are negotiable according to the nature, extent, and 
complexity of the work involved, but in no case shall they exceed the 
following ceilings:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                             Overhead      Profit
                                                                            (percent)    (percent)    Commission
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To Contractor on work performed by other than its own forces.............           --           --           10
To first tier subcontractor on work performed by its subcontractors......           --           --           10
To Contractor and/or subcontractors on work performed with their own                10           10           --
 forces..................................................................
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Not more than four percentages for overhead, profit, and 
commission shall be allowed regardless of the number of subcontractor 
tiers.
    (d) The Contractor or subcontractor shall not be allowed overhead or 
commission on the overhead, profit, and/or commission received by its 
subcontractors.
    (e) Equitable adjustments for deleted work shall include credits, 
limited to the same percentages for overhead, profit, and commission in 
paragraph (b) of this clause.
    (f) On proposals covering both increases and decreases in the amount 
of the contract, the application of the overhead, profit, and commission 
shall be on the net change in direct costs for the Contractor or the 
subcontractor performing the work.
    (g) After receipt of the Contractor's proposal, the contracting 
officer shall act within a reasonable period, provided that when the 
necessity to proceed with a change does not permit time to properly 
check the proposal, or in the event of a failure to reach an agreement 
on a proposal, the contracting officer may order the Contractor to 
proceed on the basis of the price being determined at the earliest 
practicable date. In such a case, the price shall not be more than the 
increase or less than the decrease proposed.

      Contractor Requests for Government-Owned Equipment (JUL 1997)

    (a) ``Equipment,'' as used in this clause, means commercially 
available items capable of stand-alone use, including those to be 
acquired for incorporation into special test equipment or special 
tooling.
    (b)(1) Upon determination of need for any Government-owned equipment 
item for performance of this contract, the contractor shall provide to 
the contracting officer a written request justifying the need for the 
equipment and the reasons why contractor-owned property cannot be used, 
citing the applicable FAR or contract authority for use of Government-
owned equipment. Equipment being acquired as a deliverable end item 
listed in the contract or as a component for incorporation into a 
deliverable end item listed in the contract is exempt from this 
requirement.
    (2) The contractor's request shall include a description of the item 
in sufficient detail to enable the Government to screen its inventories 
for available equipment or to purchase equipment. For this purpose, the 
contractor shall (i) prepare a separate DD Form 1419, DOD Industrial 
Plant Equipment Requisition, or equivalent format, for each item 
requested and (ii) forward it through the contracting officer to the 
Industrial Property Officer at the cognizant NASA installation at least 
30 days in advance of the date the contractor intends to acquire the 
item. Multiple units of identical items may be requested on a single 
form. Instructions for preparing the DD Form 1419 are contained in NASA 
FAR Supplement 1845.7102. If a certificate of nonavailability is not 
received within that period, the contractor may proceed to acquire the 
item, subject to having obtained contracting officer consent, if 
required, and having complied with any other applicable provisions of 
this contract.
    (c) Contractors who are authorized to conduct their own screening 
using the NASA Equipment Management System (NEMS) and other Government 
sources of excess property shall provide the evidence of screening 
results with their request for contracting officer consent. Requests to 
purchase based on unsuitability of items found shall include rationale 
for the determined unsuitability.

         Installation-Accountable Government Property (JUN 1998)

    (a) The Government property described in the clause at 1852.245-77, 
List of Installation-Accountable Property and Services, shall be made 
available to the contractor on a no-charge basis for use in performance 
of this contract. This property shall be utilized only within the 
physical confines of the NASA installation that provided the property. 
Under this clause, the Government retains accountability for, and title 
to, the property, and the contractor assumes the following user 
responsibilities: [Insert contractor user responsibilities].
    The contractor shall establish and adhere to a system of written 
procedures for compliance with these user responsibilities. Such 
procedures must include holding employees liable, when appropriate, for 
loss, damage, or destruction of Government property.
    (b)(1) The official accountable recordkeeping, physical inventory, 
financial control, and reporting of the property subject to this clause 
shall be retained by the Government and accomplished by the installation 
Supply and Equipment Management Officer (SEMO) and Financial Management 
Officer. If this contract provides for the contractor to acquire 
property, title to which will vest in the Government, the following 
additional procedures apply:

[[Page 329]]

    (i) The contractor's purchase order shall require the vendor to 
deliver the property to the installation central receiving area;
    (ii) The contractor shall furnish a copy of each purchase order, 
prior to delivery by the vendor, to the installation central receiving 
area;
    (iii) The contractor shall establish a record of the property as 
required by FAR 45.5 and 1845.5 and furnish to the Industrial Property 
Officer a DD Form 1149 Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document (or 
installation equivalent) to transfer accountability to the Government 
within 5 working days after receipt of the property by the contractor. 
The contractor is accountable for all contractor-acquired property until 
the property is transferred to the Government's accountability.
    (iv) Contractor use of Government property at an off-site location 
and off-site subcontractor use require advance approval of the 
contracting officer and notification of the SEMO. The contractor shall

Financial Reporting of NASA Property in the Custody of Contractors (OCT

    (a) The Contractor shall submit annually a NASA Form (NF) 1018, NASA 
Property in the Custody of Contractors, in accordance with the 
provisions of 1845.505-14, the instructions on the form, subpart 
1845.71, and any supplemental instructions for the current reporting 
period issued by NASA.
    (b)(1) Subcontractor use of NF 1018 is not required by this clause; 
however, the Contractor shall include data on property in the possession 
of subcontractors in the annual NF 1018.
    (2) The Contractor shall mail the original signed NF 1018 directly 
to the cognizant NASA Center Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Finance, 
unless the Contractor uses the NF 1018 Electronic Submission System 
(NESS) for report preparation and submission.
    (3) One copy shall be submitted (through the Department of Defense 
(DOD) Property Administrator if contract administration has been 
delegated to DOD) to the following address: [Insert name and address of 
appropriate NASA Center office.], unless the Contractor uses the NF 1018 
Electronic Submission System (NESS) for report preparation and 
submission.
    (c)(1) The annual reporting period shall be from October 1 of each 
year through September 30 of the following year. The report shall be 
submitted in time to be received by October 15. The information 
contained in these reports is entered into the NASA accounting system to 
reflect current asset values for agency financial statement purposes. 
Therefore, it is essential that required reports be received no later 
than October 15. Some activity may be estimated for the month of 
September, if necessary, to ensure the NF 1018 is received when due. 
However, contractors procedures must document the process for developing 
these estimates based on planned activity such as planned purchases or 
NASA Form 533 (NF 533 Contractor Financial Management Report) cost 
estimates. It should be supported and documented by historical 
experience or other corroborating evidence, and be retained in 
accordance with FAR Subpart 4.7, Contractor Records Retention. 
Contractors shall validate the reasonableness of the estimates and 
associated methodology by comparing them to the actual activity once 
that data is available, and adjust them accordingly. In addition, 
differences between the estimated cost and actual cost must be adjusted 
during the next reporting period. Contractors shall have formal policies 
and procedures, which address the validation of NF 1018 data, including 
data from subcontractors, and the identification and timely reporting of 
errors. The objective of this validation is to ensure that information 
reported is accurate and in compliance with the NASA FAR Supplement. If 
errors are discovered on NF 1018 after submission, the contractor shall 
contact the cognizant NASA Center Industrial Property Officer (IPO) 
within 30 days after discovery of the error to discuss corrective 
action.
    (2) The Contracting Officer may, in NASA's interest, withhold 
payment until a reserve not exceeding $25,000 or 5 percent of the amount 
of the contract, whichever is less, has been set aside, if the 
Contractor fails to submit annual NF 1018 reports in accordance with 
1845.505-14 and any supplemental instructions for the current reporting 
period issued by NASA. Such reserve shall be withheld until the 
Contracting Officer has determined that NASA has received the required 
reports. The withholding of any amount or the subsequent payment thereof 
shall not be construed as a waiver of any Government right.
    (d) A final report shall be submitted within 30 days after 
disposition of all property subject to reporting when the contract 
performance period is complete in accordance with (b)(1) through (3) of 
this clause.

                       Owned or Controlled by Them


<R05>
Sec. 1903.602  Exceptions.

    To avoid potential conflicts of interest or the appearance of 
preferential treatment, it is the Broadcasting Board of Governors policy 
not to award contracts, purchase orders, grants or cooperative 
agreements to Government employees or their family members or business 
concerns owned or controlled by Government employees or their family 
members. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the Board 
Director or Board Procurement Executive and supported by written 
Findings and Determination. A contract with an employee for services may 
result in violation of the dual salary compensation statutes (5 U.S.C. 
5533). Nothing in this paragraph is intended to render inapplicable the 
conflict of interest prohibition set out in 18 U.S.C. 208.


<R05>
Sec. 1903.670  Contracts between the Broadcasting Board of Governors and 
          former employees.

    To avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance of preferential 
treatment, purchase orders, contracts, grants or cooperative agreements 
with former employees of the Broadcasting Board of Governors, or with 
firms in which former employees or their family members are known to 
have controlling interest, may be entered into within two years 
following separation from employment only with the written approval of 
the Board Director. A written justification shall be made a part of the 
file. The justification must address the issue of conflict of interest 
and conclude that it does not exist; or that in spite of its existence, 
the Board's ability to meet its mission would be seriously harmed 
without the award.

    (a) Procurement requests will be prepared and submitted to the 
contracting office in accordance with Board procedures.
    (b) Except in unusual circumstances, the contracting office will not 
issue solicitations until an approved procurement request, containing a 
certification that funds are available, has been received. However, the 
contracting office may take all necessary actions up to the point of 
contract award prior to the receipt of the approved procurement request 
certifying that funds are available when:
    (1) Such action is necessary to meet critical program schedules;
    (2) It has been established that program authority has been issued 
and that funds to cover the acquisition will be available prior to the 
date set for contract award or contract modification;
    (3) A person at a level above the contracting officer authorizes 
such action prior to the issuance of the solicitation, and the contract 
file is properly documented; and
    (4) The solicitation document clearly indicates that the award is 
subject to the availability of funds.
    (c) The procurement request shall be assigned within the contracting 
office to an individual who, if not the contracting officer, will be 
responsible to the contracting officer for conducting the business 
aspects of the transaction. This individual shall review the request to 
ensure that it complies with the FAR and this Regulation and that the 
information contained in the request is in sufficient detail to prepare 
presolicitation and solicitation documents. The contracting officer, or 
other designated individual in the contracting office, shall discuss 
uncertain requirements or inconsistencies in the procurement request 
with the initiator of the request and obtain clarification prior to 
taking any further action.

<R05>
Sec. 1910.004-70  Brand name products or equal.

    (a) General. Consistent with the policy stated in FAR 10.004(a)(2), 
the Broadcasting Board of Governors acquisitions will generally not be 
based on a specifically identified product or feature(s) thereof. 
However, under unusual circumstances such an approach may be used as 
described below.
    (b) Citing brand name products. Brand name or equal purchase 
descriptions shall cite all brand name products known to be acceptable 
and of current manufacture. If the use of a brand name or equal purchase 
description results in the purchase of an acceptable brand name product 
which was not listed as an ``equal'' product, a reference to that brand 
name product should be included in the purchase description for later 
acquisitions. If a brand name product is no longer applicable, the 
reference thereto shall be deleted from subsequent purchase description.
    (c) Specifying essential characteristics. (1) It is imperative that 
brand name or equal purchase descriptions specify each physical or 
functional characteristic of the product that is essential to the 
intended use. Failure to do so may result in a defective solicitation 
and the necessity to resolicit the requirements. (See 1910.004-73.) Care 
must be taken to avoid specifying characteristics that cannot be shown 
to materially affect the intended end use and which unnecessarily 
restrict competition.
    (2) When describing essential characteristics, permissible 
tolerances should be indicated. Avoid specifying a characteristic (e.g., 
a specific dimension) of a brand name product unless it is essential to 
the Government's need. The contracting officer must be able to justify 
the requirement.


<R05>
Sec. 1910.004-71  Limits on the use of brand name or equal purchase 
          descriptions.

    (a) General. The use of brand name or equal purchase descriptions in 
solicitations is intended to promote competition by encouraging the 
offering of products that are equal in all material respects to brand 
name products cited in such descriptions. Identification by brand name 
does not indicate a preference for the products mentioned but indicates 
the quality and characteristics of products that will meet the 
Government's needs. Where a component of an item is described in the 
solicitation by a brand name or equal purchase description and the 
contracting officer determines that application of the provision of 
1952.210-70 would be impracticable, the requirement to include the entry 
described in 1910.004-72(a) shall not apply. If the provision is 
included in the solicitation for other reasons, there also shall be 
included in the solicitation a statement to identify either the 
component parts (described by brand name or equal descriptions) to which 
the provision applies or those to which it does not apply. This also 
applies to accessories related to an end item where a brand name or 
equal purchase description of the accessories is a part of the 
description of an end item. Brand name or equal descriptions shall not 
be used to acquire a particular product under the guise of competitive 
acquisition to the exclusion of other products that would meet the 
actual needs.
    (b) In small purchases within the open market limitations, brand 
name policies and procedures shall be applicable to the extent 
practicable.
    (c) Approval required. A brand name or equal purchase description 
shall not

[[Page 344]]

be used unless it has been approved at one level above the contracting 
officer.


<R05>
Sec. 1910.004-72  Solicitations, brand name or equal descriptions.

    (a) An entry substantially as follows shall be prominently inserted 
in the item listing after each item or component part of an end item to 
which a brand name or equal purchase description applies.

    Bidding on:

Manufacturer's Name:____________________________________________________
Brand:__________________________________________________________________
No.:____________________________________________________________________

    (b) Because bidders frequently overlook the requirements of the 
clause at 1952.210-70 ``Brand Name or Equal,'' the following note shall 
be inserted in the item listing after each brand name or equal item (or 
component part), or at the bottom of each page, listing several such 
items, or in a manner that may otherwise direct the offeror's attention 
to this clause.

    Offerors offering other than brand name items identified herein 
should furnish with their offers adequate information to ensure that a 
determination can be made as to equality of the product(s) offered (see 
the provision ``Brand Name or Equal'' set forth in 1952.210-70 of the 
solicitation).

    (c) If offeror samples are requested for brand name or equal 
acquisitions, the above notice shall not be included in the 
solicitation.


<R05>
Sec. 1910.004-73  Offer evaluation and award, brand name or equal 
          descriptions.

    An offer may not be rejected for failure of the offered product to 
equal a characteristic of a brand name product if it was not specified 
in the brand name or equal description. However, if it is clearly 
established that the unspecified characteristic is essential to the 
intended end use, the solicitation is defective and no award may be 
made. In such cases, the contracting officer should resolicit the 
requirements, using a purchase description that sets forth the essential 
characteristics.


<R05>
Sec. 1910.004-74  Procedure for negotiated procurements and small 
          purchases.

    (a) The policies and procedures prescribed for sealed bid 
procurements shall be generally applicable to negotiated procurements.
    (b) The clause set forth at 1952.210-70 may be adapted for use in 
negotiated procurements. If use of the clause is not practicable (as may 
be the case in unusual and compelling urgency purchases), suppliers 
shall be suitably informed that proposals offering products different 
from the products referenced by brand name will be considered if the 
contracting officer determines that the offered products meet fully the 
salient characteristics requirements of the solicitation.
    (c) In small purchases within open-market limitations, such policies 
and procedures shall be applicable to the extent practicable.


<R05>
Sec. 1910.011  Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.

    The Contracting Officer shall include the provision at 1952.210-70, 
Brand Name or Equal, in solicitations for which brand name or equal 
purchase is used.

which a warranty should apply.

officer shall make a written determination when a warranty provision is

               Subpart 2001.1_Purpose, Authority, Issuance


<R05>
Sec. 2001.101  Purpose.

    This subpart establishes Chapter 20, the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission Acquisition Regulation (NRCAR), and provides for the 
codification and publication of uniform policies and procedures for 
acquisitions by the NRC. The NRCAR is not, by itself, a complete 
document. It must be used in conjunction with the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR Chapter 1).


<R05>
Sec. 2001.102  Authority.

    The NRCAR and the amendments to it are issued by the Senior 
Procurement Executive under a delegation from the Executive Director for 
Operations dated May 16, 1997, in accordance with the authority of the 
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42. U.S.C. 161), the Energy 
Reorganization Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5841, 5872), the Federal Property 
and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 486(c)), as amended, 
FAR subpart 1.3, and other applicable law.


<R05>
Sec. 2001.103  Applicability.

    The FAR and NRCAR apply to all NRC acquisitions of supplies and 
services which obligate appropriated funds, unless exempted by Sections 
31 and 161 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 as amended, and Section 205 
of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 as amended. For procurements 
made from nonappropriated funds, the Director, Division of Contracts and 
Property Management, shall determine the rules and procedures that 
apply.


<R05>
Sec. 2001.104  Issuance.


<R05>
Sec. 2001.104-1  Publication and code arrangement.

    (a) The NRCAR and its subsequent changes are:
    (1) Published in the daily issue of the Federal Register; and
    (2) Codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).
    (b) The NRCAR is issued as 48 CFR Chapter 20.


<R05>
Sec. 2001.104-2  Arrangement of the regulations.

    (a) General. Chapter 20 is divided into parts, subparts, sections, 
subsections, paragraphs, and further subdivisions as necessary.
    (b) Numbering. The numbering system and part, subpart and section 
titles used in this Chapter conform with those used in the FAR as 
follows:

[[Page 352]]

    (1) Where Chapter 20 implements the FAR or supplements a parallel 
part, subpart, section, subsection, or paragraph of the FAR, that 
implementation or supplementation is numbered and captioned to the FAR 
part, subpart, section, or subsection being implemented or supplemented, 
except that the implementation or supplementation is preceded with a 20 
or 200 so that there will always be four numbers to the left of the 
decimal. For example, NRC's implementation of FAR 1.104-1 is shown as 
2001.104-1 and the NRC's implementation of FAR 24.1 is shown as 2024.1.
    (2) When the NRC supplements material contained in the FAR, it is 
given a unique number containing the numerals ``70'' or higher. The rest 
of the number parallels the FAR part, subpart, section, subsection, or 
paragraph it is supplementing. For example, Section 170A of the Atomic 
Energy Act of 1954, as amended, requires a more comprehensive 
organizational conflict of interest review for NRC than is contemplated 
by FAR 9.5. This supplementary material is identified as 2009.570.
    (3) Where material in the FAR requires no implementation or 
supplementation, there is no corresponding numbering in the NRCAR. 
Therefore, there may be gaps in the NRCAR sequence of numbers where the 
FAR requires no further implementation.
    (c) Citation. The NRCAR will be cited in accordance with Office of 
the Federal Register standards approved for the FAR. Thus, this section 
when referred to in the NRCAR is cited as 2001.104-2(c). When this 
section is referred to formally in official documents, such as legal

    Policy, procedures, and guidance of an internal nature will be 
promulgated through internal NRC issuances such as Management Directives 
or Division of Contracts and Property Management Instructions.

[[Page 353]]


<R05>
Sec. 2001.303  Public participation.

    FAR 1.301 and section 22 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy 
Act, as amended (41 U.S.C. 418b) require rulemaking for substantive 
acquisition rules, but allow discretion in the matter for other than 
significant issues meeting the stated criteria. Accordingly, the NRCAR 
has been promulgated and may be revised from time to time in accordance 
with FAR 1.301. This procedure for significant subject matter generally 
involves issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking that invites public 
comment, review and analysis of comments received, and publication of a 
final rule. The final rule includes a discussion of the public comments 
received and describes any changes made as a result of the comments.

          Subpart 2001.4_Deviations From the FAR and the NRCAR


<R05>
Sec. 2001.402  Policy.

    (a) Deviations from the provisions of the FAR or NRCAR may be 
granted as specified in this subpart when necessary to meet the specific 
needs of the requesting office. The development and testing of new 
techniques and methods of acquisition should not be discouraged simply 
because the action would require a FAR or NRCAR deviation.
    (b) Requests for authority to deviate from the provisions of the FAR 
or the NRCAR must be signed by the requesting office and submitted to 
the Director, Division of Contracts and Property Management, in writing, 
as far in advance as possible. Each request for deviation must contain 
the following:
    (1) A statement of the deviation desired, including identification 
of the specific paragraph number(s) of the FAR or NRCAR from which a 
deviation is requested;
    (2) The reason why the deviation is considered necessary or would be 
in the best interest of the Government;
    (3) If applicable, the name of the contractor and identification of 
the contract affected;
    (4) A description of the intended effect of the deviation;
    (5) A statement of the period of time for which the deviation is 
needed; and
    (6) Any pertinent background information which will contribute to a 
full understanding of the desired deviation.


<R05>
Sec. 2001.403  Individual deviations.

    In individual cases, deviations from either the FAR or the NRCAR 
will be authorized only when essential to effect only one contracting 
action or where special circumstances make the deviations clearly in the 
best interest of the Government. Individual deviations must be 
authorized in advance by the Director, Division of Contracts and 
Property Management.


<R05>
Sec. 2001.404  Class deviations.

    Class deviations affect more than one contracting action. Where 
deviations from the FAR or NRCAR are considered necessary for classes of 
contracts, requests for authority to deviate must be submitted in 
writing to the Director, Division of Contracts and Property Management, 
who will consider the submission jointly with the Chairperson of the 
Civilian Agency Acquisition Council, as appropriate.

commitments made to prospective contractors by persons to whom 
contracting authority has not been delegated. Any unauthorized 
commitment may be in violation of the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act, other Federal laws, the FAR, the NRCAR, and 
good acquisition practice. Certain requirements of law and regulation 
necessary for the proper establishment of a contractual obligation may 
not be met under an unauthorized commitment; for example, the 
certification of the availability of funds, justification for other than 
full and open competition, competition of sources, determination of 
contractor responsibility, certification of current pricing data, price/
cost analysis, administrative approvals, and negotiation of appropriate 
contract clauses.
    (b) The execution of otherwise proper contracts made by individuals 
without contracting authority, or by contracting officers in excess of 
the limits of their delegated authority, may later be ratified. To be 
effective, the ratification must be in the form of a written procurement 
document clearly stating that ratification of a previously unauthorized 
commitment is intended. All ratifications of procurement actions valued 
at $2,500 or less may be approved by the appropriate regional 
administrator or Headquarters contracting officer. For any such action, 
all other terms of subpart 2001.6 are applicable. All ratification 
actions exceeding $2,500 shall be approved by the Competition Advocate.
    (c) Requests received by contracting officers for ratification of 
commitments made by personnel lacking contracting authority must be 
processed as follows:
    (1) The Designating Official that is responsible for the office 
request shall furnish the contracting officer all records and documents 
concerning the commitment and a complete written statement of facts, 
including, but not limited to:
    (i) A written statement consistent with the complexity and size of 
the action as to why the contracting office was not used including the 
name of the employee who made the commitment;
    (ii) A statement as to why the proposed contractor was selected;
    (iii) A list of other sources considered;
    (iv) A description of work performed, or to be performed, or 
products to be furnished;
    (v) The estimated or agreed upon contract price;

    (vii) A description of how unauthorized commitments in similar 
circumstances will be avoided in the future.
    (2) The contracting officer shall review the written statement of 
facts for a determination of approval of all actions valued at $2,500 or 
less. For actions greater than $2,500, the contracting officer shall 
forward the written statement of facts to the Competition Advocate 
through the Director, Division of Contracts and Property Management with 
any comments or information that should be considered in evaluating the 
request for ratification.

concurrence if there is concern regarding the propriety of the funding 
source, appropriateness of the expense, or when some other legal issue 
is involved.

<R05>
Sec. 2009.100  NRC policy.

    (a) It is NRC policy that only competitively awarded contracts shall 
be placed with an individual who was employed by the NRC within two 
years from the date of the Request for Procurement Action. This policy 
also applies to:
    (1) The noncompetitive award of contracts to organizations where 
former NRC employees have dominant ownership interests in the 
organization, such as partners or majority stockholders;
    (2) The noncompetitive award of contracts to organizations where 
former NRC employees have dominant management interests, such as 
principal officers, or where the organization is predominantly staffed 
by former NRC employees; and
    (3) The noncompetitive award of contracts, task orders or other NRC 
work assignments where the particular assignment is to be performed by 
designated former NRC employees, including principal investigators, key 
personnel, and others who will perform more than a nominal amount of the 
work in question.

[[Page 358]]

    (b) The following procurement actions are considered noncompetitive 
for the purposes of this policy:
    (1) Contracts awarded noncompetitively under the Small Business 
Administration's 8(a) Program;
    (2) Individual task orders if the former employee was not identified 
as ``key personnel'' in a proposal which was evaluated under competitive 
procedures;
    (3) Unsolicited proposals;
    (4) Subcontracts that require review for the purpose of granting 
consent under NRC prime contracts.
    (c) The term NRC employee includes special Government employees 
performing services for NRC as experts, advisors, consultants, or 
members of advisory committees, if--
    (1) The contract arises directly out of the individual's activity as 
a special employee;
    (2) The individual is in a position to influence the award of the 
contract; or
    (3) The Contracting Officer determines that another conflict of 
interest exists.
    (d) A justification explaining why it is in the best interest of the 
Government to contract with an individual or firm described in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section on a noncompetitive basis may be 
approved by the Senior Procurement Executive after consulting with the 
Executive Director for Operations. This is in addition to any 
justification and approvals which may be required by the FAR for use of 
other than full and open competition.
    (e) Nothing in this policy statement relieves former employees from 
obligations prescribed by law, such as 18 U.S.C. 207, Restrictions on 
Former Officers, Employees, and Elected Officials of the Executive and 
Legislative Branches.


<R05>
Sec. 2009.105-70  Contract provisions.

    The contracting officer responsible for the contract affected by the 
debarment or suspension shall perform the actions required by FAR 
9.404(c) (1) through (6).


<R05>
Sec. 2009.405  Effect of listing.

    Compelling reasons are considered to be present where failure to 
contract with the debarred or suspended contractor would seriously harm 
the agency's programs and prevent accomplishment of mission 
requirements. The Senior Procurement Executive is authorized to make the 
determinations under FAR 9.405. Requests for these determinations must 
be submitted from the Head of the Contracting Activity, through the 
Director, Office of Administration, to the Senior Procurement Executive.


<R05>
Sec. 2009.405-1  Continuation of current contracts.

    The Head of the Contracting Activity is authorized to make the

in accordance with FAR 9.405-1.


<R05>
Sec. 2009.405-2  Restrictions on subcontracting.

    The Head of the Contracting Activity is authorized to approve 
subcontracts with debarred or suspended subcontractors under FAR 9.405-

<R05>
Sec. 2009.406  Debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 2009.406-3  Procedures.

    (a) Investigation and referral. (1) When a contracting officer 
becomes aware of possible irregularities or any information which may be 
sufficient cause for

[[Page 359]]

debarment, the contracting officer must first submit a complete 
statement of facts (including a copy of any criminal indictments, if 
applicable) and a recommendation for action to the Head of the 
Contracting Activity. If the contracting officer's statement of facts 
indicates misconduct on the part of the contractor in regard to an NRC 
contract, the Head of the Contracting Activity will refer the matter of 
misconduct to the Inspector General to determine if an investigation is 
required prior to referring the case to the debarring official.
    (2) To the extent the Head of the Contracting Activity believes that 
sufficient grounds for debarment exist, independent of any pending 
investigation by the Inspector General, the Head of the Contracting 
Activity shall immediately forward the case, without reference to any 
pending investigation, and a recommendation for action to the Senior 
Procurement Executive for review. In such circumstances, the Head of the 
Contracting Activity will take no additional action in regard to a 
specific matter of misconduct referred to the Inspector General prior to 
consulting with the Inspector General.
    (b) Decision-making process. If, after reviewing the recommendations 
and consulting with the Office of the General Counsel and, if 
appropriate, the Office of the Inspector General, the debarring official 
determines debarment is justified, the debarring official shall initiate 
the proposed debarment in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) and notify the 
Head of the Contracting Activity of the action taken. If the contractor 
fails to submit a timely written response within 30 days after receipt 
of the notice in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c)(4), the debarring 
official may notify the contractor in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(d) 
that the contractor is debarred.
    (c) Fact-finding proceedings. For actions listed under FAR 9.406-
3(b)(2), the contractor shall be given the opportunity to appear at an 
informal hearing. The hearing should be held at a location and time that 
is convenient to the parties concerned and no later than 30 days after 
the contractor received the notice, if at all possible. The contractor 
and any specifically named affiliates may be represented by counsel or 
any duly authorized representative. Witnesses may be called by either 
party. The proceedings must be conducted expeditiously and in such a 
manner that each party will have an opportunity to present all 
information considered pertinent to the proposed debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 2009.407  Suspension.


<R05>
Sec. 2009.407-3  Procedures.

    (a) Investigation and referral. (1) When a contracting officer 
becomes aware of possible irregularities or any information which may be 
sufficient cause for suspension, the contracting officer must first 
submit a complete statement of facts (including a copy of any criminal 
indictments, if applicable) and a recommendation for action to the Head 
of the Contracting Activity. If the contracting officer's statement of 
facts indicates misconduct on the part of the contractor in regard to an 
NRC contract, the Head of the Contracting Activity will refer the matter 
of misconduct to the Inspector General to determine if an investigation 
is required prior to referring the case to the suspension official.
    (2) To the extent the Head of the Contracting Activity believes that 
sufficient grounds for debarment exist, independent of any pending 
investigation by the Inspector General, the Head of the Contracting 
Activity shall immediately forward the case, without reference to any 
pending investigation, and a recommendation for action to the Senior 
Procurement Executive for review. In such circumstances, the Head of the 
Contracting Activity will take no additional action in regard to a 
specific matter of misconduct referred to the Inspector General prior to 
consulting with the Inspector General.
    (b) Decision-making process. If, after reviewing the recommendations 
and consulting with the Office of the General Counsel, and if 
appropriate, the Office of the Inspector General, the suspending 
official determines suspension is justified, the suspending official 
shall initiate the proposed suspension in accordance with FAR 9.407-
3(b)(2). The contractor shall be given the opportunity to appear at an 
informal

[[Page 360]]

hearing, similar in nature to the hearing for debarments as discussed in 
FAR 9.406-3(b)(2). If the contractor fails to submit a timely written 
response within 30 days after receipt of the notice in accordance with 
FAR 9.407-3(c)(5), the suspending official may notify the contractor in 
accordance with FAR 9.407-3(d) that the contractor is suspended.


<R05>
Sec. 2009.470  Appeals.

    A debarred or suspended contractor may appeal the debarring/
suspending official's decision by mailing or otherwise furnishing a 
written notice within 90 days from the date of the decision to the

           Subpart 2009.5_Organizational Conflicts of Interest


<R05>
Sec. 2009.500  Scope of subpart.

    In accordance with 42 U.S.C. 2210a., NRC acquisitions are processed 
in accordance with 2009.570, which takes precedence over FAR 9.5 with 
respect to organizational conflicts of interest. Where non-conflicting 
guidance appears in FAR 9.5, that guidance must be followed.


<R05>
Sec. 2009.570  NRC organizational conflicts of interest.


<R05>
Sec. 2009.570-1  Scope of policy.

    (a) It is the policy of NRC to avoid, eliminate, or neutralize 
contractor organizational conflicts of interest. The NRC achieves this 
objective by requiring all prospective contractors to submit information 
describing relationships, if any, with organizations or persons 
(including those regulated by the NRC) which may give rise to actual or 
potential conflicts of interest in the event of contract award.
    (b) Contractor conflict of interest determinations cannot be made 
automatically or routinely. The application of sound judgment on 
virtually a case-by-case basis is necessary if the policy is to be 
applied to satisfy the overall public interest. It is not possible to 
prescribe in advance a specific method or set of criteria which would 
serve to identify and resolve all of the contractor conflict of interest 
situations that might arise. However, examples are provided in the 
regulations in this chapter to guide application of this policy 
guidance. The ultimate test is as follows: Might the contractor, if 
awarded the contract, be placed in a position where its judgment may be 
biased, or where it may have an unfair competitive advantage?
    (c) The conflict of interest rule contained in this subpart applies 
to contractors and offerors only. Individuals or firms who have other 
relationships with the NRC (e.g., parties to a licensing proceeding) are 
not covered by the regulations in this chapter. This rule does not apply 
to the acquisition of consulting services through the personnel 
appointment process. NRC agreements with other Govern ment agencies, 
international organizations, or state, local, or foreign Governments. 
Separate procedures for avoiding conflicts of interest will be employed 
in these agreements, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 2009.570-2  Definitions.

    Affiliates means business concerns which are affiliates of each 
other when either directly or indirectly one concern or individual 
controls or has the power to control another, or when a third party 
controls or has the power to control both.
    Contract means any contractual agreement or other arrangement with 
the NRC except as provided in 2009.570-1(c).
    Contractor means any person, firm, unincorporated association, joint 
venture, co-sponsor, partnership, corporation, affiliates thereof, or 
their successors in interest, including their chief executives, 
directors, key personnel (identified in the contract), proposed 
consultants or subcontractors, which are a party to a contract with the 
NRC.
    Evaluation activities means any effort involving the appraisal of a 
technology, process, product, or policy.
    Offeror or prospective contractor means any person, firm, 
unincorporated association, joint venture, co-sponsor, partnership, 
corporation, or their affiliates or successors in interest, including 
their chief executives, directors, key personnel, proposed consultants, 
or subcontractors, submitting a bid or

[[Page 361]]

proposal, solicited or unsolicited, to the NRC to obtain a contract.
    Organizational conflicts of interest means that a relationship 
exists whereby a contractor or prospective contractor has present or 
planned interests related to the work to be performed under an NRC 
contract which:
    (1) May diminish its capacity to give impartial, technically sound, 
objective assistance and advice, or may otherwise result in a biased 
work product; or
    (2) May result in its being given an unfair competitive advantage.
    Potential conflict of interest means that a factual situation exists 
that suggests that an actual conflict of interest may arise from award 
of a proposed contract. The term potential conflict of interest is used 
to signify those situations that--
    (1) Merit investigation before contract award to ascertain whether 
award would give rise to an actual conflict; or
    (2) Must be reported to the contracting officer for investigation if 
they arise during contract performance.
    Research means any scientific or technical work involving 
theoretical analysis, exploration, or experimentation.
    Subcontractor means any subcontractor of any tier who performs work 
under a contract with the NRC except subcontracts for supplies and 
subcontracts in amounts not exceeding $10,000.
    Technical consulting and management support services means internal 
assistance to a component of the NRC in the formulation or 
administration of its programs, projects, or policies which normally 
require that the contractor be given access to proprietary information 
or to information that has not been made available to the public. These 
services typically include assistance in the preparation of program 
plans, preliminary designs, specifications, or statements of work.


<R05>
Sec. 2009.570-3  Criteria for recognizing contractor organizational 
          conflicts of interest.

    (a) General. (1) Two questions will be asked in determining whether 
actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest exist:
    (i) Are there conflicting roles which might bias an offeror's or 
contractor's judgment in relation to its work for the NRC?
    (ii) May the offeror or contractor be given an unfair competitive 
advantage based on the performance of the contract?
    (2) NRC's ultimate determination that organizational conflicts of 
interest exist will be made in light of common sense and good business 
judgment based upon the relevant facts. While it is difficult to 
identify and to prescribe in advance a specific method for avoiding all 
of the various situations or relationships that might involve potential 
organizational conflicts of interest, NRC personnel will pay particular 
attention to proposed contractual requirements that call for the 
rendering of advice, consultation or evaluation activities, or similar 
activities that directly lay the groundwork for the NRC's decisions on 
regulatory activities, future procurements, and research programs. Any 
work performed at an applicant or licensee site will also be closely 
scrutinized by the NRC staff.
    (b) Situations or relationships. The following situations or 
relationships may give rise to organizational conflicts of interest:
    (1) The offeror or contractor shall disclose information that may 
give rise to organizational conflicts of interest under the following 
circumstances. The information may include the scope of work or 
specification for the requirement being performed, the period of 
performance, and the name and telephone number for a point of contact at 
the organization knowledgeable about the commercial contract.
    (i) Where the offeror or contractor provides advice and 
recommendations to the NRC in the same technical area where it is also 
providing consulting assistance to any organization regulated by the 
NRC.
    (ii) Where the offeror or contractor provides advice to the NRC on 
the same or similar matter on which it is also providing assistance to 
any organization regulated by the NRC.
    (iii) Where the offeror or contractor evaluates its own products or 
services,

[[Page 362]]

or has been substantially involved in the development or marketing of 
the products or services of another entity.
    (iv) Where the award of a contract would result in placing the 
offeror or contractor in a conflicting role in which its judgment may be 
biased in relation to its work for the NRC, or would result in an unfair 
competitive advantage for the offeror or contractor.
    (v) Where the offeror or contractor solicits or performs work at an 
applicant or licensee site while performing work in the same technical 
area for the NRC at the same site.
    (2) The contracting officer may request specific information from an 
offeror or contractor or may require special contract clauses such as 
provided in 2009.570-5(b) in the following circumstances:
    (i) Where the offeror or contractor prepares specifications that are 
to be used in competitive procurements of products or services covered 
by the specifications.
    (ii) Where the offeror or contractor prepares plans for specific 
approaches or methodologies that are to be incorporated into competitive 
procurements using the approaches or methodologies.
    (iii) Where the offeror or contractor is granted access to 
information not available to the public concerning NRC plans, policies, 
or programs that could form the basis for a later procurement action.
    (iv) Where the offeror or contractor is granted access to 
proprietary information of its competitors.
    (v) Where the award of a contract might result in placing the 
offeror or contractor in a conflicting role in which its judgment may be 
biased in relation to its work for the NRC or might result in an unfair 
competitive advantage for the offeror or contractor.
    (c) Policy application guidance. The following examples are 
illustrative only and are not intended to identify and resolve all 
contractor organizational conflict of interest situations.
    (1)(i) Example. The ABC Corp., in response to a Request For Proposal 
(RFP), proposes to undertake certain analyses of a reactor component as 
called for in the RFP. The ABC Corp. is one of several companies 
considered to be technically well qualified. In response to the inquiry 
in the RFP, the ABC Corp. advises that it is currently performing 
similar analyses for the reactor manufacturer.
    (ii) Guidance. An NRC contract for that particular work normally 
would not be awarded to the ABC Corp. because the company would be 
placed in a position in which its judgment could be biased in 
relationship to its work for the NRC. Because there are other well-
qualified companies available, there would be no reason for considering 
a waiver of the policy.
    (2)(i) Example. The ABC Corp., in response to an RFP, proposes to 
perform certain analyses of a reactor component that is unique to one 
type of advanced reactor. As is the case with other technically 
qualified companies responding to the RFP, the ABC Corp. is performing 
various projects for several different utility clients. None of the ABC 
Corp. projects have any relationship to the work called for in the RFP. 
Based on the NRC evaluation, the ABC Corp. is considered to be the best 
qualified company to perform the work outlined in the RFP.
    (ii) Guidance. An NRC contract normally could be awarded to the ABC 
Corp. because no conflict of interest exists which could motivate bias 
with respect to the work. An appropriate clause would be included in the 
contract to preclude the ABC Corp. from subsequently contracting for 
work with the private sector that could create a conflict during the 
performance of the NRC contract. For example, ABC Corp. would be 
precluded from the performance of similar work for the company 
developing the advanced reactor mentioned in the example.
    (3)(i) Example. The ABC Corp., in response to a competitive RFP, 
submits a proposal to assist the NRC in revising NRC's guidance 
documents on the respiratory protection requirements of 10 CFR part 20. 
ABC Corp. is the only firm determined to be technically acceptable. ABC 
Corp. has performed substantial work for regulated utilities in the past 
and is expected to continue similar efforts in the future. The work has 
and will cover the writing, implementation, and administration of 
compliance respiratory protection programs for nuclear power plants.

[[Page 363]]

    (ii) Guidance. This situation would place the firm in a role where 
its judgment could be biased in relationship to its work for the NRC. 
Because the nature of the required work is vitally important in terms of 
the NRC's responsibilities and no reasonable alternative exists, a 
waiver of the policy, in accordance with 2009.570-9 may be warranted. 
Any waiver must be fully documented in accordance with the waiver 
provisions of this policy with particular attention to the establishment 
of protective mechanisms to guard against bias.
    (4)(i) Example. The ABC Corp. submits a proposal for a new system to 
evaluate a specific reactor component's performance for the purpose of 
developing standards that are important to the NRC program. The ABC 
Corp. has advised the NRC that it intends to sell the new system to 
industry once its practicability has been demonstrated. Other companies 
in this business are using older systems for evaluation of the specific 
reactor component.
    (ii) Guidance. A contract could be awarded to the ABC Corp. if the 
contract stipulates that no information produced under the contract will 
be used in the contractor's private activities unless this information 
has been reported to the NRC. Data on how the reactor component 
performs, which is reported to the NRC by contractors, will normally be 
disseminated by the NRC to others to preclude an unfair competitive 
advantage. When the NRC furnishes information about the reactor 
component to the contractor for the performance of contracted work, the 
information may not be used in the contractor's private activities 
unless the information is generally available to others. Further, the 
contract will stipulate that the contractor will inform the NRC 
contracting officer of all situations in which the information, 
developed about the performance of the reactor component under the 
contract, is proposed to be used.
    (5)(i) Example. The ABC Corp., in response to a RFP, proposes to 
assemble a map showing certain seismological features of the Appalachian 
fold belt. In accordance with the representation in the RFP and 
2009.570-3(b)(1)(i), ABC Corp. informs the NRC that it is presently 
doing seismological studies for several utilities in the eastern United 
States, but none of the sites are within the geographic area 
contemplated by the NRC study.
    (ii) Guidance. The contracting officer would normally conclude that 
award of a contract would not place ABC Corp. in a conflicting role 
where its judgment might be biased. Section 2052.209-72(c) Work for 
Others, would preclude ABC Corp. from accepting work which could create 
a conflict of interest during the term of the NRC contract.
    (6)(i) Example. AD Division of ABC Corp., in response to a RFP, 
submits a proposal to assist the NRC in the safety and environmental 
review of applications for licenses for the construction, operation, and 
decommissioning of fuel cycle facilities. ABC Corp. is divided into two 
separate and distinct divisions, AD and BC. The BC Division performs the 
same or similar services for industry. The BC Division is currently 
providing the same or similar services required under the NRC's contract 
for an applicant or licensee.
    (ii) Guidance. An NRC contract for that particular work would not be 
awarded to the ABC Corp. The AD Division could be placed in a position 
to pass judgment on work performed by the BC Division, which could bias 
its work for NRC. Further, the Conflict of Interest provisions apply to 
ABC Corp. and not to separate or distinct divisions within the company. 
If no reasonable alternative exists, a waiver of the policy could be 
sought in accordance with 2009.570-9.
    (7)(i) Example. The ABC Corp. completes an analysis for NRC of steam 
generator tube leaks at one of a utility's six sites. Three months 
later, ABC Corp. is asked by this utility to perform the same analysis 
at another of its sites.
    (ii) Guidance. Section 2052.290-72(c)(3) would prohibit the 
contractor from beginning this work for the utility until one year after 
completion of the NRC work at the first site.
    (8)(i) Example. ABC Corp. is assisting NRC in a major on-site 
analysis of a utility's redesign of the common areas between its twin 
reactors. The contract is for two years with an estimated

[[Page 364]]

value of $5 million. Near the completion of the NRC work, ABC Corp. 
requests authority to solicit for a $100K contract with the same utility 
to transport spent fuel to a disposal site. ABC Corp. is performing no 
other work for the utility.
    (ii) Guidance. The Contracting Officer would allow the contractor to 
proceed with the solicitation because it is not in the same technical 
area as the NRC work; and the potential for technical bias by the 
contractor because of financial ties to the utility is slight due to the 
relative value of the two contracts.
    (9)(i) Example. The ABC Corp. is constructing a turbine building and 
installing new turbines at a reactor site. The contract with the utility 
is for five years and has a total value of $100 million. ABC Corp. has 
responded to an NRC Request For Proposal requiring the contractor to 
participate in a major team inspection unrelated to the turbine work at 
the same site. The estimated value of the contract is $75K.
    (ii) Guidance. An NRC contract would not normally be awarded to ABC 
Corp. because these factors create the potential for financial loyalty 
to the utility that may bias the technical judgment of the contractor.
    (d) Other considerations. (1) The fact that the NRC can identify and 
later avoid, eliminate, or neutralize any potential organizational 
conflicts arising from the performance of a contract is not relevant to 
a determination of the existence of conflicts prior to the award of a 
contract.
    (2) It is not relevant that the contractor has the professional 
reputation of being able to resist temptations which arise from 
organizational conflicts of interest, or that a follow-on procurement is 
not involved, or that a contract is awarded on a competitive or a sole 
source basis.


<R05>
Sec. 2009.570-4  Representation.

    (a) The following procedures are designed to assist the NRC 
contracting officer in determining whether situations or relationships 
exist which may constitute organizational conflicts of interest with 
respect to a particular offeror or contractor. The procedures apply to 
small purchases meeting the criteria stated in the following paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (b) The organizational conflicts of interest representation 
provision at 2052.209-71 must be included in solicitations and contracts 
resulting from unsolicited proposals. The contracting officer must also 
include this provision for task orders and contract modifications for 
new work for:
    (1) Evaluation services or activities;
    (2) Technical consulting and management support services;
    (3) Research; and
    (4) Other contractual situations where special organizational 
conflicts of interest provisions are noted in the solicitation and would 
be included in the resulting contract. This representation requirement 
also applies to all modifications for additional effort under the 
contract except those issued under the ``Changes'' clause. Where, 
however, a statement of the type required by the organizational 
conflicts of interest representation provisions has previously been 
submitted with regard to the contract being modified, only an updating 
of the statement is required.
    (c) The offeror may, because of actual or potential organizational 
conflicts of interest, propose to exclude specific kinds of work 
contained in a RFP unless the RFP specifically prohibits the exclusion. 
Any such proposed exclusion by an offeror will be considered by the NRC 
in the evaluation of proposals. If the NRC considers the proposed 
excluded work to be an essential or integral part of the required work 
and its exclusion would be to the detriment of the competitive posture 
of the other offerors, the NRC shall reject the proposal as 
unacceptable.
    (d) The offeror's failure to execute the representation required by 
paragraph (b) of this section with respect to an invitation for bids is 
considered to be a minor informality. The offeror will be permitted to 
correct the omission.


<R05>
Sec. 2009.570-5  Contract clauses.

    (a) General contract clause. All contracts and simplified 
acquisitions of the types set forth in 2009.570-4(b) must

[[Page 365]]

include the clause entitled, ``Contractor Organizational Conflicts of 
Interest,'' set forth in 2052.209-72.
    (b) Other special contract clauses. If it is determined from the 
nature of the proposed contract that an organizational conflict of 
interest exists, the contracting officer may determine that the conflict 
can be avoided, or, after obtaining a waiver in accordance with 
2009.570-9, neutralized through the use of an appropriate special 
contract clause. If appropriate, the offeror may negotiate the terms and 
conditions of these clauses, including the extent and time period of any 
restriction. These clauses include but are not limited to:
    (1) Hardware exclusion clauses which prohibit the acceptance of 
production contracts following a related non-production contract 
previously performed by the contractor;
    (2) Software exclusion clauses;
    (3) Clauses which require the contractor (and certain of its key 
personnel) to avoid certain organizational conflicts of interest; and
    (4) Clauses which provide for protection of confidential data and 
guard against its unauthorized use.


<R05>
Sec. 2009.570-6  Evaluation, findings, and contract award.

    The contracting officer shall evaluate all relevant facts submitted 
by an offeror and other relevant information. After evaluating this 
information against the criteria of 2009.570-3, the contracting officer 
shall make a finding of whether organizational conflicts of interest 
exist with respect to a particular offeror. If it has been determined 
that real or potential conflicts of interest exist, the contracting 
officer shall:
    (a) Disqualify the offeror from award;
    (b) Avoid or eliminate such conflicts by appropriate measures; or
    (c) Award the contract under the waiver provision of 2009.570-9.


<R05>
Sec. 2009.570-7  Conflicts identified after award.

    If potential organizational conflicts of interest are identified 
after award with respect to a particular contractor and the contracting 
officer determines that conflicts do exist and that it would not be in 
the best interest of the Government to terminate the contract, as 
provided in the clauses required by 2009.570-5, the contracting officer 
shall take every reasonable action to avoid, eliminate, or, after 
obtaining a waiver in accordance with 2009.570-9, neutralize the effects 
of the identified conflict.


<R05>
Sec. 2009.570-8  Subcontracts.

    The contracting officer shall require offerors and contractors to 
submit a representation statement from all subcontractors (other than a 
supply subcontractor) and consultants performing services in excess of 
$10,000 in accordance with 2009.570-4(b). The contracting officer shall 
require the contractor to include contract clauses in accordance with 
2009.570-5 in consultant agreements or subcontracts involving 
performance of work under a prime contract.


<R05>
Sec. 2009.570-9  Waiver.

    (a) The contracting officer determines the need to seek a waiver for 
specific contract awards with the advice and concurrence of the program 
office director and legal counsel. Upon the recommendation of the Senior 
Procurement Executive, and after consultation with legal counsel, the 
Executive Director for Operations may waive the policy in specific cases 
if he determines that it is in the best interest of the United States to 
do so.
    (b) Waiver action is strictly limited to those situations in which:
    (1) The work to be performed under contract is vital to the NRC 
program;
    (2) The work cannot be satisfactorily performed except by a 
contractor whose interests give rise to a question of conflict of 
interest.
    (3) Contractual and/or technical review and surveillance methods can 
be employed by the NRC to neutralize the conflict.
    (c) The justification and approval documents for any waivers must be 
placed in the NRC Public Document Room.


<R05>
Sec. 2009.570-10  Remedies.

    In addition to other remedies permitted by law or contract for a 
breach of the restrictions in this subpart or for any intentional 
misrepresentation

[[Page 366]]

or intentional nondisclosure of any relevant interest required to be 
provided for this section, the NRC may debar the contractor from 
subsequent NRC contracts.

        Subpart 2015.3_Source Selection Processes and Techniques


<R05>
Sec. 2015.300  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart applies to all contracts awarded on a competitive basis 
in accordance with FAR part 15. This subpart does not apply to contracts 
awarded on a non-competitive basis to the Small Business Administration 
under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act.


<R05>
Sec. 2015.303  Responsibilities.

    (a) The source selection authority is the contracting officer. The 
contracting officer, acting as the source selection authority, shall 
select an offer for award based on review of the Source Evaluation 
Panel's recommendation contained in the reports described in paragraph 
(c) of this section.
    (b) Any cancellation of solicitations and subsequent rejection of 
all proposals must be approved by the Head of the Contracting Activity.
    (c) For all proposed contracts with total estimated values in excess 
of the simplified acquisition threshold and expected to result from 
competitive technical and price/cost negotiations, the cooperative 
review efforts of technical, contracting, and other administrative 
personnel are formalized through establishment of a Source Evaluation 
Panel. A single technical member may be appointed to the Source 
Evaluation Panel to evaluate proposals with the contracting officer's 
approval. In these instances, the Designating Official may appoint 
technical advisors (non-voting members) to assist the single technical 
member. The Source Evaluation Panel should not exceed five members, 
including the Chairperson except in unusual cases. The Source Evaluation 
Panel's proposal evaluation report(s) may include a Competitive Range 
Report and a Final Evaluation Report (to be used when award will be made 
after conducting discussions), or a Recommendation for Award Report (to 
be used when award will be made without discussions).
    (d) The Designating Official (Office Director or designee) is 
responsible for appointing a Source Evaluation Panel to evaluate 
competitive technical proposals in accordance with the solicitation 
technical criteria. The Designating Official is also responsible for 
conducting an independent review and evaluation of the Source Evaluation 
Panel's proposal evaluation report(s) to the contracting officer.


<R05>
Sec. 2015.304  Evaluation factors.

    The evaluation factors included in the solicitation serve as the 
standard against which all proposals are evaluated and are the basis for 
the development of proposal preparation instructions in accordance with 
FAR 15.304(b). The solicitation may indicate the relative importance of 
evaluation factors and subfactors by assigning a numerical weight to 
each factor. If a solicitation uses numerical weights, those weights 
shall be stated in the solicitation. The relative importance of factors 
that are not numerically weighted will be stated in the solicitation. 
Examples of factors which may not be numerically weighted are conflict 
of interest, estimated cost, and ``go/no go'' evaluation factors.


<R05>
Sec. 2015.305  Proposal evaluation.

    The contracting officer may provide offerors' cost proposals and 
supporting financial information to members of the Source Evaluation 
Panel at the same time technical proposals are distributed for 
evaluation. The Source Evaluation Panel shall use this information to 
perform an accurate integrated assessment of each offeror's proposal 
based on all the facts presented to them.

                  Subpart 2015.6_Unsolicited Proposals

review, assign a docket number, and send copies of the unsolicited 
proposal to the appropriate program office Director(s) or designee for 
evaluation.
    (b) The Division of Contracts and Property Management shall be 
responsible for controlling reproduction and distribution of proposal 
material by notifying evaluators of their responsibilities and tracking 
the number of proposals received and forwarded to evaluators.
    (c) An acknowledgment letter will be sent to the proposer by The 
Division of Contracts and Property Management. The letter will provide 
an estimated date for a funding decision or identifying the reasons for 
non-acceptance of the proposal for review in accordance with FAR 15.606-
1(b) and FAR 15.606-1(c).

           Subpart 2042.570_Differing Professional Views (DPV)


<R05>
Sec. 2042.570-1  Policy.

    The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) policy is to support the 
contractor's expression of professional health and safety-related 
concerns associated with the contractor's work for the NRC that may 
differ from a prevailing NRC staff view, disagree with an NRC decision 
or policy position, or take issue with proposed or established agency 
practices. An occasion may arise when an NRC contractor, contractor's 
personnel, or subcontractor personnel believes that a conscientious 
expression of a competent judgement is required to document these 
concerns on matters directly associated with its performance of the 
contract. The procedure described in 2052.242-71, Procedures for 
Resolving NRC Contractor Differing Professional Views, provides for the 
expression and resolution of DPVs of health and safety-related concerns 
associated with the mission of the agency by NRC contractors, contractor 
personnel, or subcontractor personnel on matters directly associated 
with its performance of the contract. The contractor shall provide a 
copy of the NRC DPV procedure to all of its employees performing under 
this contract and to all subcontractors who shall, in turn, provide a 
copy of the procedure to its employees. The prime contractor or 
subcontractor shall submit all DPV's received but need not endorse them.


<R05>
Sec. 2042.570-2  Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.

    (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 2052.242-70, 
Resolving NRC Contractor Differing Professional Views, in the body of 
cost reimbursement solicitations and contracts for professional 
services, as appropriate. This clause may not be altered by the 
contracting officer.
    (b) The contracting officer shall include the clause at 2052.242-71, 
Procedures for Resolving NRC Contractor Differing Professional Views, as 
an attachment to cost reimbursement solicitations and contracts for 
professional services, as appropriate. This clause may not be altered by 
the contracting officer.

                  Subpart 2042.8_Disallowance of Costs


<R05>
Sec. 2042.803  Disallowing costs after incurrence.

    (a) Vouchers and invoices submitted to NRC must be submitted to the 
contracting officer or designee for review and approval for payment. If 
the examination of a voucher or invoice raises a question regarding the 
allowability of a cost submitted, the contracting officer or designee 
shall:
    (1) Hold informal discussions with the contractor as appropriate.
    (2) If the discussions do not resolve the matter, the contracting 
officer shall issue a notice advising the contractor of costs 
disallowed. The notice must advise the contractor that it may:
    (i) If in disagreement with the disallowance, submit a written claim 
to the contracting officer for payment of the disallowed cost and 
explain why the cost should be reimbursed; or
    (ii) If the disagreement(s) cannot be settled, file a claim under 
the disputes clause which will be processed in accordance with disputes 
procedures found at FAR subpart 33.2; and

[[Page 379]]

    (3) Process the voucher or invoice for payment and advise the NRC 
Division of Accounting and Finance to deduct the disallowed costs when 
scheduling the voucher for payment.
    (b) When audit reports or other notifications question costs or 
consider them unallowable, the contracting officer shall resolve all 
cost issues through discussions with the contractor and/or auditor 
within six months of receipt of the audit report whenever possible.
    (1) One of the following courses of action must be pursued:
    (i) Accept and implement audit recommendations as submitted;
    (ii) Accept the principle of the audit recommendation but adjust the 
amount of the questioned costs;
    (iii) Reject audit findings and recommendations.
    (2) When implementing the chosen course of action, the contracting 
officer shall:
    (i) Hold discussions with the auditor and contractor, as 
appropriate;
    (ii) If the contracting officer agrees with the auditor concerning 
the questioned costs, attempt to negotiate a mutual settlement of 
questioned costs;
    (iii) Issue a final decision, including any disallowance of 
questioned costs; inform the contractor of his/her right to appeal the 
decision under the disputes procedures found at FAR subpart 33.2; and 
provide a copy of the final decision to the Office of the Inspector 
General; and
    (iv) Initiate immediate recoupment actions for all disallowed costs 
owed the Government by one or more of the following methods:
    (A) Request that the contractor provide a credit adjustment (offset) 
and an adequate description/explanation of the adjustment against 
amounts billed the Government on the next or other future invoice(s) 
submitted under the contract for which the disallowed costs apply;
    (B) Deduct the disallowed costs from the next invoice submitted 
under the contract;
    (C) Deduct the disallowed costs on a schedule determined by the 
contracting officer after discussion with the contractor (if the 
contracting officer determines that an immediate and complete deduction 
is inappropriate); and
    (D) Advise the contractor that a refund is immediately payable to 
the Government (in situations where there are insufficient payments owed 
by the Government to effect recovery from the contract).

Sec. 2045.370  Providing Government property (in general).

    (a) Unless otherwise provided for in FAR 45.302-1(d), applicable to 
Government facilities with a unit cost of less than $10,000, a 
contractor may be provided Government property or allowed to purchase 
the property at Government expense if the contracting officer, with the 
advice of the agency property official determines that:
    (1) No practicable or economical alternative exists; e.g., 
acquisition from other sources, utilization of subcontractors, rental of 
property, or modification of program project requirements;
    (2) Furnishing Government property is likely to result in 
substantially lower costs to the Government for the items produced or 
services rendered when all costs involved (e.g., transportation, 
installation, modification, maintenance, etc.) are compared with the 
costs to the Government of the contractor's use of privately-owned 
property; and
    (3) The Government receives adequate consideration for providing the 
property.

(NRCAR 2052.211-72, and 2052.211-72 Alternate 1), that references the 
acquisition of, or change in status of, contractor-held property 
purchased with government funds valued at the time of purchase at 
$50,000 or more to the Chief, Property and Acquisition Oversight Branch, 
Division of Contracts and Property Management.

              Subpart 2052.2_Text of Provisions and Clauses


<R05>
Sec. 2052.200  Authority.


<R05>
Sec. 2052.204-70  Security.

    As prescribed at 2004.404(a), the contracting officer shall insert 
the following clause in solicitations and contracts during which the 
contractor may have access to, or contact with classified information, 
including National Security information, restricted data, formerly 
restricted data, and other classified data:

                           Security (OCT 1999)

    (a) Security/Classification Requirements Form. The attached NRC Form 
187 (See List of Attachments) furnishes the basis for providing security 
and classification requirements to prime contractors, subcontractors, or 
others (e.g., bidders) who have or may have an NRC contractual 
relationship that requires access to classified information or matter, 
access on a continuing basis (in excess of 90 or more days) to NRC 
Headquarters controlled buildings, or otherwise requires NRC photo 
identification or card-key badges.
    (b) It is the contractor's duty to safeguard National Security 
Information, Restricted Data, and Formerly Restricted Data. The 
contractor shall, in accordance with the Commission's security 
regulations and requirements, be responsible for safeguarding National 
Security Information, Restricted Data, and Formerly Restricted Data, and 
for protecting against sabotage, espionage, loss, and theft, the 
classified documents and material in the contractor's possession in 
connection with the performance of work under this contract. Except as 
otherwise expressly provided in this contract, the contractor shall 
transmit to the Commission any classified matter in the possession of 
the contractor or any person under the contractor's control in 
connection with performance of this contract upon completion or 
termination of this contract.
    (1) The contractor shall complete a certificate of possession to be 
furnished to the Commission specifying the classified matter to be 
retained if the retention is:
    (i) Required after the completion or termination of the contract; 
and
    (ii) Approved by the contracting officer.

[[Page 382]]

    (2) The certification must identify the items and types or 
categories of matter retained, the conditions governing the retention of 
the matter and their period of retention, if known. If the retention is 
approved by the contracting officer, the security provisions of the 
contract continue to be applicable to the matter retained.
    (c) In connection with the performance of the work under this 
contract, the contractor may be furnished, or may develop or acquire, 
proprietary data (trade secrets) or confidential or privileged 
technical, business, or financial information, including Commission 
plans, policies, reports, financial plans, internal data protected by 
the Privacy Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-579), or other information which has 
not been released to the public or has been determined by the Commission 
to be otherwise exempt from disclosure to the public. The contractor 
agrees to hold the information in confidence and not to directly or 
indirectly duplicate, disseminate, or disclose the information, in whole 
or in part, to any other person or organization except as necessary to 
perform the work under this contract. The contractor agrees to return 
the information to the Commission or otherwise dispose of it at the 
direction of the contracting officer. Failure to comply with this clause 
is grounds for termination of this contract.
    (d) Regulations. The contractor agrees to conform to all security 
regulations and requirements of the Commission which are subject to 
change as directed by the NRC Division of Facilities and Security and 
the Contracting Officer. These changes will be under the authority of 
the FAR Changes clause referenced in Section I of this document.
    (e) Definition of National Security Information. As used in this 
clause, the term National Security Information means information that 
has been determined pursuant to Executive Order 12958 or any predecessor 
order to require protection against unauthorized disclosure and that is 
so designated.
    (f) Definition of Restricted Data. As used in this clause, the term 
Restricted Data means all data concerning design, manufacture, or 
utilization of atomic weapons; the production of special nuclear 
material; or the use of special nuclear material in the production of 
energy, but does not include data declassified or removed from the 
Restricted Data category under to Section 142 of the Atomic Energy Act 
of 1954, as amended.
    (g) Definition of Formerly Restricted Data. As used in this clause 
the term Formerly Restricted Data means all data removed from the 
Restricted Data category under Section 142-d of the Atomic Energy Act of 
1954, as amended.
    (h) Security clearance personnel. The contractor may not permit any 
individual to have access to Restricted Data, Formerly Restricted Data, 
or other classified information, except in accordance with the Atomic 
Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations or 
requirements applicable to the particular type or category of classified 
information to which access is required. The contractor shall also 
execute a Standard Form 312, Classified Information Nondisclosure 
Agreement, when access to classified information is required.
    (i) Criminal liabilities. Disclosure of National Security 
Information, Restricted Data, and Formerly Restricted Data relating to 
the work or services ordered hereunder to any person not entitled to 
receive it, or failure to safeguard any Restricted Data, Formerly 
Restricted Data, or any other classified matter that may come to the 
contractor or any person under the contractor's control in connection 
with work under this contract, may subject the contractor, its agents, 
employees, or subcontractors to criminal liability under the laws of the 
United States. (See the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 
2011 et seq.; 18 U.S.C. 793 and 794; and Executive Order 12958.)
    (j) Subcontracts and purchase orders. Except as otherwise 
authorized, in writing, by the contracting officer, the contractor shall 
insert provisions similar to the foregoing in all subcontracts and 
purchase orders under this contract.
    (k) In performing contract work, the contractor shall classify all 
documents, material, and equipment originated or generated by the 
contractor in accordance with guidance issued by the Commission. Every 
subcontract and purchase order issued under the contract that involves 
originating or generating classified documents, material, and equipment 
must provide that the subcontractor or supplier assign the proper 
classification to all documents, material, and equipment in accordance 
with guidance furnished by the contractor.

                             (End of clause)


<R05>
Sec. 2052.204-71  Site access badge requirements.

    As prescribed at 2004.404(b), the contracting officer shall insert 
the following clause in all solicitations and contracts under which the 
contractor will require access to Government facilities. The clause may 
be altered to reflect any special conditions to be applied to foreign 
nationals:

                Site Access Badge Requirements (JAN 1993)

    During the life of this contract, the rights of ingress and egress 
for contractor personnel must be made available as required. In this 
regard, all contractor personnel

[[Page 383]]

whose duties under this contract require their presence on-site shall be 
clearly identifiable by a distinctive badge furnished by the Government. 
The Project Officer shall assist the contractor in obtaining the badges 
for contractor personnel. It is the sole responsibility of the 
contractor to ensure that each employee has proper identification at all 
times. All prescribed identification must be immediately delivered to 
the Security Office for cancellation or disposition upon the termination 
of employment of any contractor personnel. Contractor personnel shall 
have this identification in their possession during on-site performance 
under this contract. It is the contractor's duty to assure that 
contractor personnel enter only those work areas necessary for 
performance of contract work and to assure the safeguarding of any 
Government records or data that contractor personnel may come into 
contact with.

                             (End of clause)


<R05>
Sec. 2052.209-70  Current/former agency employee involvement.

    As prescribed at 2009.105-70, the contracting officer shall insert 
the following provision in all solicitations:

          Current/Former Agency Employee Involvement (OCT 1999)

    (a) The following representation is required by the NRC Acquisition 
Regulation 2009.105-70(b). It is not NRC policy to encourage offerors 
and contractors to propose current/former agency employees to perform 
work under NRC contracts and as set forth in the above cited provision, 
the use of such employees may, under certain conditions, adversely 
affect NRC's consideration of non-competitive proposals and task orders.
    (b) There ( ) are ( ) are no current/former NRC employees (including 
special Government employees performing services as experts, advisors, 
consultants, or members of advisory committees) who have been or will be 
involved, directly or indirectly, in developing the offer, or in 
negotiating on behalf of the offeror, or in managing, administering, or 
performing any contract, consultant agreement, or subcontract resulting 
from this offer. For each individual so identified, the Technical and 
Management proposal must contain, as a separate attachment, the name of 
the individual, the individual's title while employed by the NRC, the 
date individual left NRC, and a brief description of the individual's 
role under this proposal.

                           (End of provision)


<R05>
Sec. 2052.209-71  Contractor organizational conflicts of interest 
          (representation).

    As prescribed in 2009.570-4(b) and 2009.570-8, the contracting 
officer must insert the following provision in applicable solicitations 
and in contracts resulting from unsolicited proposals. The contracting 
officer must also include the following in task orders and contract 
modifications for new work.

  Contractor Organizational Conflicts of Interest Representation (OCT 
                                  1999)

    I represent to the best of my knowledge and belief that:
    The award to ---------------- of a contract or the modification of 
an existing contract does / / does not / / involve situations or 
relationships of the type set forth in 48 CFR 2009.570-3(b).
    (a) If the representation, as completed, indicates that situations 
or relationships of the type set forth in 48 CFR 2009.570-3(b) are 
involved, or the contracting officer otherwise determines that potential 
organizational conflicts of interest exist, the offeror shall provide a 
statement in writing that describes in a concise manner all relevant 
factors bearing on his representation to the contracting officer. If the 
contracting officer determines that organizational conflicts exist, the 
following actions may be taken:
    (1) Impose appropriate conditions which avoid such conflicts;
    (2) Disqualify the offeror; or
    (3) Determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the 
United States to seek award of the contract under the waiver provisions 
of 48 CFR 2009-570-9.
    (b) The refusal to provide the representation required by 48 CFR 
2009.570-4(b), or upon request of the contracting officer, the facts 
required by 48 CFR 2009.570-3(b), must result in disqualification of the 
offeror for award.

                           (End of provision)


<R05>
Sec. 2052.209-72  Contractor organizational conflicts of interest.

    As prescribed at 2009.570-5(a) and 2009.570-8, the contracting 
officer must insert the following clause in all applicable 
solicitations, contracts, and simplified acquisitions of the types 
described; 2009.570-4(b):

       Contractor Organizational Conflicts of Interest (JAN 1993)

    (a) Purpose. The primary purpose of this clause is to aid in 
ensuring that the contractor:

[[Page 384]]

    (1) Is not placed in a conflicting role because of current or 
planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) 
which relate to the work under this contract; and
    (2) Does not obtain an unfair competitive advantage over other 
parties by virtue of its performance of this contract.
    (b) Scope. The restrictions described apply to performance or 
participation by the contractor, as defined in 48 CFR 2009.570-2 in the 
activities covered by this clause.
    (c) Work for others.
    (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this contract, during the 
term of this contract, the contractor agrees to forego entering into 
consulting or other contractual arrangements with any firm or 
organization the result of which may give rise to a conflict of interest 
with respect to the work being performed under this contract. The 
contractor shall ensure that all employees under this contract abide by 
the provision of this clause. If the contractor has reason to believe, 
with respect to itself or any employee, that any proposed consultant or 
other contractual arrangement with any firm or organization may involve 
a potential conflict of interest, the contractor shall obtain the 
written approval of the contracting officer before the execution of such 
contractual arrangement.
    (2) The contractor may not represent, assist, or otherwise support 
an NRC licensee or applicant undergoing an NRC audit, inspection, or 
review where the activities that are the subject of the audit, 
inspection, or review are the same as or substantially similar to the 
services within the scope of this contract (or task order as 
appropriate) except where the NRC licensee or applicant requires the 
contractor's support to explain or defend the contractor's prior work 
for the utility or other entity which NRC questions.
    (3) When the contractor performs work for the NRC under this 
contract at any NRC licensee or applicant site, the contractor shall 
neither solicit nor perform work in the same or similar technical area 
for that licensee or applicant organization for a period commencing with 
the award of the task order or beginning of work on the site (if not a 
task order contract) and ending one year after completion of all work 
under the associated task order, or last time at the site (if not a task 
order contract).
    (4) When the contractor performs work for the NRC under this 
contract at any NRC licensee or applicant site,
    (i) The contractor may not solicit work at that site for that 
licensee or applicant during the period of performance of the task order 
or the contract, as appropriate.
    (ii) The contractor may not perform work at that site for that 
licensee or applicant during the period of performance of the task order 
or the contract, as appropriate, and for one year thereafter.
    (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the contracting officer may 
authorize the contractor to solicit or perform this type of work (except 
work in the same or similar technical area) if the contracting officer 
determines that the situation will not pose a potential for technical 
bias or unfair competitive advantage.
    (d) Disclosure after award.
    (1) The contractor warrants that to the best of its knowledge and 
belief, and except as otherwise set forth in this contract, that it does 
not have any organizational conflicts of interest as defined in 48 CFR 
2009.570-2.
    (2) The contractor agrees that if, after award, it discovers 
organizational conflicts of interest with respect to this contract, it 
shall make an immediate and full disclosure in writing to the 
contracting officer. This statement must include a description of the 
action which the contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid or 
mitigate such conflicts. The NRC may, however, terminate the contract if 
termination is in the best interest of the Government.
    (3) It is recognized that the scope of work of a task-order-type 
contract necessarily encompasses a broad spectrum of activities. 
Consequently, if this is a task-order-type contract, the contractor 
agrees that it will disclose all proposed new work involving NRC 
licensees or applicants which comes within the scope of work of the 
underlying contract. Further, if this contract involves work at a 
licensee or applicant site, the contractor agrees to exercise diligence 
to discover and disclose any new work at that licensee or applicant 
site. This disclosure must be made before the submission of a bid or 
proposal to the utility or other regulated entity and must be received 
by the NRC at least 15 days before the proposed award date in any event, 
unless a written justification demonstrating urgency and due diligence 
to discover and disclose is provided by the contractor and approved by 
the contracting officer. The disclosure must include the statement of 
work, the dollar value of the proposed contract, and any other documents 
that are needed to fully describe the proposed work for the regulated 
utility or other regulated entity. NRC may deny approval of the 
disclosed work only when the NRC has issued a task order which includes 
the technical area and, if site-specific, the site, or has plans to 
issue a task order which includes the technical area and, if site-
specific, the site, or when the work violates paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3) 
or (c)(4) of this section.
    (e) Access to and use of information.
    (1) If, in the performance of this contract, the contractor obtains 
access to information, such as NRC plans, policies, reports, studies, 
financial plans, internal data protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 
U.S.C.

[[Page 385]]

Section 552a (1988)), or the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 
Section 552 (1986)), the contractor agrees not to:
    (i) Use this information for any private purpose until the 
information has been released to the public;
    (ii) Compete for work for the Commission based on the information 
for a period of six months after either the completion of this contract 
or the release of the information to the public, whichever is first;
    (iii) Submit an unsolicited proposal to the Government based on the 
information until one year after the release of the information to the 
public; or
    (iv) Release the information without prior written approval by the 
contracting officer unless the information has previously been released 
to the public by the NRC.
    (2) In addition, the contractor agrees that, to the extent it 
receives or is given access to proprietary data, data protected by the 
Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. Section 552a (1988)), or the Freedom of 
Information Act (5 U.S.C. Section 552 (1986)), or other confidential or 
privileged technical, business, or financial information under this

    As prescribed at 2014.201-670(c), the contracting officer shall 
insert the following provision in applicable invitations for bids 
(paragraph ``(f)'' of this provision is optional):

                        Bid Evaluation (JAN 1993)

    (a) Award will be made to that responsive, responsible bidder within 
the meaning of FAR Subpart 9.1 whose total bid amount, as set forth by 
the bidder in Section B of this Invitation for Bid (IFB), constitutes 
the lowest overall evaluated final contract price to the Government 
based upon the requirements for the schedule. Bids will be evaluated for 
purposes of award by first ascertaining the sum of the total amount for 
each of the items specified in Section B of this solicitation. This will 
constitute the bidder's ``Total Bid Amount.''
    (b) Bidders shall insert a definite price or indicate ``no charge'' 
in the blank space provided for each item and/or sub-item listed in 
Section B. Unless expressly provided for in the bid, no additional 
charge will be allowed for work performed under the contract other than 
the unit prices stipulated for each item and/or sub-item.
    (c) Any bid which is materially unbalanced as to price for the 
separate items specified in Section B of this IFB may be rejected as 
nonresponsive. An unbalanced bid is defined as one which is based on 
prices which, in the opinion of the NRC, are significantly less than 
cost for some work and/or prices that may be significantly overstated 
for other work.

[[Page 389]]

    (d) Separation charges, in any form, are not solicited. Bids 
containing charges for discontinuance, termination, failure to exercise 
an option, or for any other purpose will cause the bid to be rejected as 
nonresponsive.
    (e) A preaward on-site survey of the bidder's facilities, equipment, 
etc., in accordance with FAR 9.105 and 9.106, may be made by 
representatives of the Commission for the purpose of determining whether 
the bidder is responsible within the meaning of FAR 9.1, and whether the 
bidder possesses qualifications that are conducive to the production of 
work that will meet the requirements, specifications, and provisions of 
this contract. If requested by the Commission, the prospective 
contractor may also be required to submit statements within * hours 
after receiving the request:
    (1) Concerning their ability to meet any of the minimum standards 
set forth in FAR 9.104,
    (2) Samples of work, and
    (3) Names and addresses of additional clients, Government agencies, 
and/or commercial firms which the bidder is now doing or had done 
business with.
    (f) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, the award of any 
contract resulting from this solicitation will be made on an ``all or 
none'' basis. Thus, bids submitted on fewer than the items listed in 
Section B of this IFB, or on fewer than the estimated quantity, will 
cause the bid to be rejected as nonresponsive.

insert in solicitations and contracts the following clause as applicable

                        Key Personnel (JAN 1993)

    (a) The following individuals are considered to be essential to the 
successful performance of the work hereunder:

*

The contractor agrees that personnel may not be removed from the 
contract work or replaced without compliance with paragraphs (b) and (c) 
of this section.
    (b) If one or more of the key personnel, for whatever reason, 
becomes, or is expected to become, unavailable for work under this 
contract for a continuous period exceeding 30 work days, or is expected 
to devote substantially less effort to the work than indicated in the 
proposal or initially anticipated, the contractor shall immediately 
notify the contracting officer and shall, subject to the con currence of 
the contracting officer, promptly replace the personnel with personnel 
of at least substantially equal ability and qualifications.
    (c) Each request for approval of substitutions must be in writing 
and contain a detailed explanation of the circumstances necessitating 
the proposed substitutions. The request must also contain a complete 
resume

[[Page 390]]

for the proposed substitute and other information requested or needed by 
the contracting officer to evaluate the proposed substitution. The 
contracting officer and the project officer shall evaluate the 
contractor's request and the contracting officer shall promptly notify 
the contractor of his or her decision in writing.
    (d) If the contracting officer determines that suitable and timely 
replacement of key personnel who have been reassigned, terminated, or 
have otherwise become unavailable for the contract work is not 
reasonably forthcoming, or that the resultant reduction of productive 
effort would be so substantial as to impair the successful completion of 
the contract or the service order, the contract may be terminated by the 
contracting officer for default or for the convenience of the 
Government, as appropriate. If the contracting officer finds the 
contractor at fault for the condition, the contract price or fixed fee 
may be equitably adjusted downward to compensate the Government for any 
resultant delay, loss, or damage.

    *To be incorporated into any resultant contract

Sec. 2052.215-79  Contract award and evaluation of proposals.

    As prescribed in 2015.209(a)(1), the contracting officer shall 
insert the following provision in solicitations when technical merit is 
more important than cost:

          Contract Award and Evaluation of Proposals (OCT 1999)

    (a) By use of narrative and numerical (as appropriate) scoring 
techniques, proposals are evaluated against the evaluation factors 
specified in paragraph * below. These factors are listed in their 
relative order of importance.
    (b) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts 
resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose 
proposal(s) represents the best value, as defined in FAR 2.101, after 
evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the 
solicitation.
    (c) The Government may:
    (1) Reject any or all proposals if the action is in the Government's 
interest.
    (2) Waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals 
received.

[[Page 395]]

    (d) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a 
contract without discussions with offerors. The Government reserves the 
right to seek proposal clarifications (e.g., capability issues as 
described in FAR 15.306(a) or minor or clerical errors as described in 
FAR 14.407); and hold communications as described in FAR 15.306(b)). 
Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's 
best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government 
reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer 
later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer 
determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the 
competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition 
can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of 
proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will 
permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.
    (e) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item 
for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or 
prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal.
    (f) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, 
after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the 
Government's best interest to do so.
    (g) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not 
constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.
    (h) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if 
the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or 
subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable 
total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is 
significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application 
of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the 
Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an 
unacceptable risk to the Government.
    (i) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be 
considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance 
or schedule risk.
    (j) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise 
furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the 
proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by 
either party.
    (k) A separate cost analysis is performed on each cost proposal. To 
provide a common base for evaluation of cost proposals, the level of 
effort data must be expressed in staff hours. Where a Contractor 
Spending Plan (CSP) is required by other provisions of this 
solicitation, consideration is given to the Plan for completeness, 
reasonableness, and as a measure of effective management of the effort.
    * To be incorporated into the solicitation.

                           (End of provision)

    Alternate 1 (OCT 1999). As prescribed at 2015.209-70(e)(2), 
Alternate 1 may be used when proposals are to be evaluated on a lowest 
price, technically acceptable basis. Substitute the following paragraph 
for paragraph (b) in the clause at 2052.215-79:

    (b) Although technical merit in the evaluation criteria set forth 
below is a factor in the evaluation of proposals, award will be made on 
the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or 
exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors,

    Alternate 2 (OCT 1999). As prescribed at 2015.209-70(e)(2), 
Alternate 2 may be used when cost and technical merit are of equal 
significance. Substitute the following paragraph for paragraph (b) in 
the clause at 2052.215-79:

    (b) In the selection of a contractor, technical merit in the 
evaluation criteria set forth below and cost bear equal significance. To 
be selected for an award, the proposed cost must be realistic and 
reasonable.

Sec. 2052.216-70  Level of effort.

    As prescribed at 2016.307-70(a) the contracting officer shall insert 
the following provision in solicitations for negotiated procurements 
containing labor costs other than maintenance services, to be awarded on 
a cost reimbursement, cost sharing, cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-
fixed-fee, time and materials, or labor hours basis.

                       Level of Effort (JAN 1993)

    The NRC's estimate of the total effort for this project is 
approximately * professional and * clerical staff-years for the duration 
of this contract. This information is advisory and is not to be

    (a) Pending the establishment of final indirect rates which must be 
negotiated based on audit of actual costs, the contractor shall be 
reimbursed for allowable indirect costs as follows:
*

    (b) The contracting officer may adjust these rates as appropriate 
during the term of the contract upon acceptance of any revisions 
proposed by the contractor. It is the contractor's responsibility to 
notify the contracting officer in accordance with FAR 52.232-20, 
Limitation of Cost, or FAR 52.232-22, Limitation of Funds, as 
applicable, if these changes affect performance of work within the 
established cost or funding limitations.

audit activity on the basis of actual allowable costs result in a lower 
amount for indirect costs, the lower amount will be paid. The Government 
may not be obligated to pay any additional amounts for indirect costs 
above the ceiling rates set forth above for the applicable period.
    *To be incorporated into any resultant contract.

Sec. 2052.216-72  Task order procedures.

    As prescribed at 2016.506-70(a), the contracting officer may insert 
the following clause in applicable solicitations and contracts that 
contain task order procedures. This clause may be altered to fit the 
circumstances of the requirement.

                    Task Order Procedures (OCT 1999)

    (a) Task order request for proposal. When a requirement within the 
scope of work for this contract is identified, the contracting officer

    As prescribed in 2042.570-1, the contracting officer shall insert 
the following clause in the body of cost reimbursement solicitations and 
contracts for professional services, as appropriate. This clause may not 
be altered by the contracting officer.

   Resolving NRC Contractor Differing Professional Views (DPVs) (Date)

    (a) The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) policy is to support 
the contractor's expression of professional health and safety related 
concerns associated with the contractor's work for NRC that may differ 
from a prevailing NRC staff view, disagree with an NRC decision or 
policy position, or take issue with proposed or established agency 
practices. An occasion may arise when an NRC contractor, contractor's 
personnel, or subcontractor personnel believes that a conscientious 
expression of a competent judgement is required to document such 
concerns on matters directly associated with its performance of the 
contract. The NRC's policy is to support these instances as Differing 
Professional Views (DPVs).
    (b) The procedure that will be used provides for the expression and 
resolution of differing professional views (DPVs) of health and safety 
related concerns associated with the mission of the agency by NRC 
contractors, contractor personnel or subcontractor personnel on matters 
directly associated with its performance of the contract. This procedure 
may be found in Attachments to this document. The contractor shall 
provide a copy of the NRC DPV procedure to all of its employees 
performing under this contract and to all subcontractors who shall, in 
turn, provide a copy of the procedure to its employees. The prime 
contractor or subcontractor shall submit all DPV's received but need not 
endorse them.

                             (End of clause)


<R05>
Sec. 2052.242-71  Procedures for Resolving Differing Professional Views.

    As prescribed in 2042.570-2(b), the contracting officer shall 
include the following clause as an attachment to cost reimbursement 
solicitations and contracts for professional services, as appropriate. 
This clause may not be altered by the contracting officer.

  Procedures for Resolving NRC Contractor Differing Professional Views 
                            (DPVs) (OCT 1999)

    (a) The following procedure provides for the expression and 
resolution of differing professional views (DPVs) of health and safety 
related concerns of NRC contractors and contractor personnel on matters 
connected to the subject of the contract. Subcontractor DPVs must be 
submitted through the prime contractor. The prime contractor or 
subcontractor shall submit all DPV's received but need not endorse them.
    (b) The NRC may authorize up to eight reimbursable hours for the 
contractor to document, in writing, a DPV by the contractor, the 
contractor's personnel, or subcontractor personnel. The contractor shall 
not be entitled to any compensation for effort on a DPV which exceeds 
the specified eight hour limit.
    (c) Before incurring costs to document a DPV, the contractor shall 
first determine whether there are sufficient funds obligated under the 
contract which are available to cover the costs of writing a DPV. If 
there are insufficient obligated funds under the contract, the 
contractor shall first request the NRC contracting officer for 
additional funding to cover the costs of preparing the DPV and 
authorization to proceed.
    (d) Contract funds shall not be authorized to document an allegation 
where the use of this NRC contractor DPV process is inappropriate. 
Examples of such instances are: allegations of wrongdoing which should 
be addressed directly to the NRC Office of the Inspector General (OIG), 
issues submitted anonymously, or issues raised which have already been 
considered, addressed, or rejected, absent significant new information. 
This procedure does not provide anonymity. Individuals desiring 
anonymity should contact the NRC OIG or submit the information under 
NRC's Allegation Program, as appropriate.
    (e) When required, the contractor shall initiate the DPV process by 
submitting a written statement directly to the NRC Office Director or 
Regional Administrator responsible for the contract, with a copy to the 
Contracting Officer, Division of Contracts and Property Management, 
Office of Administration. Each DPV submitted will be evaluated on its 
own merits.
    (f) The DPV, while being brief, must contain the following as it 
relates to the subject matter of the contract:
    (1) A summary of the prevailing NRC view, existing NRC decision or 
stated position, or the proposed or established NRC practice.
    (2) A description of the submitter's views and how they differ from 
any of the above items.

[[Page 400]]

    (3) The rationale for the submitter's views, including an assessment 
based on risk, safety and cost benefit considerations of the 
consequences should the submitter's position not be adopted by NRC.
    (g) The Office Director or Regional Administrator will immediately 
forward the submittal to the NRC DPV Review Panel and acknowledge 
receipt of the DPV, ordinarily within five (5) calendar days of receipt.
    (h) The panel will normally review the DPV within seven calendar 
days of receipt to determine whether enough information has been 
supplied to undertake a detailed review of the issue. Typically, within 
30 calendar days of receipt of the necessary information to begin a 
review, the panel will provide a written report of its findings to the 
Office Director or Regional Administrator and to the Contracting 
Officer, which includes a recommended course of action.
    (i) The Office Director or Regional Administrator will consider the 
DPV Review Panel's report, make a decision on the DPV and provide a 
written decision to the contractor and the Contracting Officer normally 
within seven calendar days after receipt of the panel's recommendation.
    (j) Subsequent to the decision made regarding the DPV Review Panel's 
report, a summary of the issue and its disposition will be included in 
the NRC Weekly Information Report submitted by the Office Director. The 
DPV file will be retained in the Office or Region for a minimum of one 
year thereafter. For purposes of the contract, the DPV shall be 
considered a deliverable under the contract. Based upon the Office 
Director or Regional Administrator's report, the matter will be closed.

<R05>
Sec. 2101.101  Purpose.

    (a) This subpart establishes Chapter 21, Office of Personnel 
Management Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance Federal Acquisition 
Regulation, within title 48, the Federal Acquisition Regulations System, 
of the Code of Federal Regulations. The short title of this regulation 
shall be LIFAR.
    (b) The purpose of the LIFAR is to implement and supplement the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) specifically for acquiring and 
administering a contract, or contracts, for life insurance under the 
Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) Program.


<R05>
Sec. 2101.102  Authority.

    (a) The LIFAR is issued by the Director of the Office of Personnel 
Management in accordance with the authority of 5 U.S.C. Chapter 87 and 
other applicable laws and regulations.
    (b) The LIFAR does not replace or incorporate regulations found at 5 
CFR part 870, which provide the substantive policy guidance for 
administration of the FEGLI Program under 5 U.S.C. chapter 87. The 
following is the order of precedence in interpreting a contract 
provision under the FEGLI Program:
    (1) 5 U.S.C. chapter 87.
    (2) 5 CFR part 870.
    (3) 48 CFR chapters 1 and 21.
    (4) The FEGLI Program contract.

<R05>
Sec. 2101.103  Applicability.

    The FAR is generally applicable to contracts negotiated in the FEGLI 
Program pursuant to 5 U.S.C. chapter 87. The LIFAR implements and

    (2) The Code of Federal Regulations, in cumulative form.
    (b) The LIFAR is issued as chapter 21 of title 48 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 2101.104-2  Arrangement of regulations.

    (a) General. The LIFAR conforms with the arrangement and numbering 
system prescribed by FAR 1.104 and 1.303. However, when a FAR part or 
subpart is adequate for use without further OPM implementation or 
supplementation, there will be no corresponding LIFAR part, subpart, 
etc. The LIFAR is to be used in conjunction with the FAR and the order 
for use is:
    (1) FAR;
    (2) LIFAR.
    (b) Citation. (1) In formal documents, such as legal briefs, 
citation of Chapter 21 material that has been published in the Federal 
Register will be to title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

[[Page 404]]

    (2) In informal documents, any section of chapter 21 may be 
identified as ``LIFAR'' followed by the section number.

              Subpart 2101.3_Agency Acquisition Regulations


<R05>

    (a) Procedures, contract clauses, and other aspects of the 
acquisition process for contracts in the FEGLI Program shall be 
consistent with the principles of the FAR. Changes to the FAR that are 
otherwise authorized by statute or applicable regulation, dictated by 
the practical realities associated with certain unique aspects of life 
insurance, or necessary to satisfy specific needs of the Office of 
Personnel Management, to the extent not otherwise regulated in the FAR, 
shall be implemented as amendments to the LIFAR and published in the 
Federal Register, or as deviations to the FAR in accordance with FAR 
subpart 1.4.

guides to clarify or implement the LIFAR within OPM. Clarifying or 
implementing procedures, instructions, directives, and guides issued 
pursuant to this section of the LIFAR must:
    (1) Be consistent with the policies and procedures contained in this 
chapter as implemented and supplemented from time to time; and
    (2) Follow the format, arrangement, and numbering system of this 
chapter to the extent practicable.

<R05>
Sec. 2103.570  Misleading, Deceptive, or Unfair Advertising.

    (a) OPM, or the Contractor with the approval of OPM, makes available 
to Federal employees a booklet describing the provisions of the FEGLI 
Program, which includes information about eligibility, enrollment, and 
general procedures. The booklet, along with valid election documents, 
serves as certification of the employee's coverage under the FEGLI 
Program. Any marketing/advertising directed specifically at Federal 
employees and life insurance contacts with Federal employees for the 
purpose of selling FEGLI Program coverage must be approved by OPM in 
advance.
    (b) The Contractor is prohibited from making incomplete and/or 
incorrect comparisons or using disparaging or minimizing techniques to 
compare its other products or services to those of the FEGLI Program. 
The Contractor agrees that any advertising material authorized and 
released by the Contractor which mentions the FEGLI

[[Page 406]]

Program will be truthful and not misleading and will present an accurate 
statement of FEGLI Program benefits. The Contractor will use reasonable 
efforts to assure that agents selling its other products are aware of 
and abide by this prohibition.
    (c) The contractor's failure to conform to the requirements of this 
subpart shall be considered by OPM in the determination of the service 
charge prenegotiation objective.

    FAR subpart 9.4 is implemented by changing the FAR offeror's 
certification at FAR 52.209-5 (which is part of a solicitation) to a 
pre-contract certificate and a contract clause. These provisions reflect

    (a) The Contractor must meet the requirements of chapter 87 of title 
5, United States Code; part 870 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations; 
chapter 1 of title 48, Code of Federal Regulations; and the standards in 
this subpart. The Contractor must continue to meet these and the 
following statutory and regulatory requirements while under contract 
with OPM. Failure to meet these requirements and standards is cause for 
OPM's termination of the contract in accordance with part 2149 of this 
chapter.
    (b) The contractor must actually be engaged in the life insurance 
business and must be licensed to transact life and accidental death and 
dismemberment insurance under the laws of all the States and the 
District of Columbia at the time of application.

[[Page 408]]

    (c) The contractor must not be a Federal, State, local or 
territorial government entity.
    (d) The contractor must not be debarred, suspended or ineligible to 
participate in Government contracting or subcontracting for any reason.
    (e) The contractor must keep statistical and financial records 
regarding the FEGLI Program separate from that of all its other lines of 
business.
    (f) The Contractor agrees to enter into annual premium rate 
redeterminations with OPM.
    (g) The Contractor must furnish such reasonable reports as OPM 
determines are necessary to administer the FEGLI Program. The cost of 
preparation of such reports will be considered an allowable expense 
within the administrative expense ceiling defined in section 2152.231-70 
of this chapter.
    (h) The contractor must establish and maintain a system of internal 
control that provides reasonable assurance that:
    (1) The payment of claims and other expenses is in compliance with 
legal, regulatory, and contractual guidelines;
    (2) Funds, property, and other FEGLI Program assets are safeguarded 
against waste, loss, unauthorized use, or misappropriation;
    (3) Revenues and expenditures applicable to FEGLI Program operations 
are properly recorded and accounted for to permit the preparation of 
reliable financial reporting and to maintain accountability over assets; 
and,
    (4) Data are accurately and fairly disclosed in all reports required 
by OPM.
    (i) The contractor must permit representatives of OPM and of the 
General Accounting Office to audit and examine records and accounts 
pertaining to the FEGLI Program at such reasonable times and places as 
may be designated by OPM or the General Accounting Office.

anticipated occurrence that might reasonably be expected to have a 
material effect upon the contractor's ability to meet its obligations 
under the LIFAR.


<R05>
Sec. 2110.7002  Contractor investment of FEGLI Program funds.

    (a) The Contractor is required to invest and reinvest all FEGLI 
Program funds on hand, including any attributable to the special 
contingency reserve (as used in 5 U.S.C. 8712), until needed to 
discharge promptly the obligations incurred under the contract. Within 
the constraints of safety and liquidity of investments, the Contractor 
must seek to maximize investment income. However, the Contractor will 
not be responsible for any actions taken at the direction of OPM.
    (b) The Contractor is required to credit income earned from its 
investment of FEGLI Program funds to the FEGLI Program. Thus, the 
Contractor

[[Page 409]]

must be able to allocate investment income to the FEGLI Program in an 
appropriate manner. If the Contractor fails to invest funds on hand, 
properly allocate investment income, or credit any income due to the 
contract, for whatever reason, it must return or credit any investment 
income lost to OPM or the FEGLI Program, retroactive to the date that 
such funds should have been originally invested, allocated, or credited 
in accordance with the clause at 2152.210-70 of this chapter.

compliance in the following areas:
    (1) Management: Stable management with experience pertinent to the 
life insurance industry and, in particular, large group management; 
sufficient operating experience to enable OPM to evaluate past and 
expected future performance.
    (2) Marketing: Past ability to attract and retain large group 
contracts; steady or increasing amount of group life insurance in force.
    (3) Legal expertise: Demonstrated competence in researching, 
compiling, and implementing various Federal and State laws that may 
impact payment of benefits; ability to defend legal challenges to 
payment of benefits.
    (4) Financial condition: Establishment of firm budget projections 
and demonstrated success in keeping costs at or below those projections 
on a regular basis; evidence of the ability to sustain operations in the 
future and to meet obligations under the contract OPM might enter into 
with the company; adequate reserve levels; assets exceeding liabilities.
    (5) Establishment of office: Ability to establish an administrative 
office capable of assessing, tracking, and paying claims.
    (6) Internal controls: Ability to establish and maintain a system of 
internal control that provides reasonable assurance that the payment of 
claims and other expenses will be in compliance with legal, regulatory, 
and contractual guidelines; funds, property, and other FEGLI Program 
assets will be safeguarded against waste, loss, unauthorized use, or 
misappropriation; and revenues and expenditures applicable to FEGLI

    Pricing of FEGLI Program premium rates is governed by 5 U.S.C. 8707, 
8708, 8711, 8714a, 8714b, and 8714c. FAR subpart 15.4 will be 
implemented by applying cost analysis policies and procedures. To the 
extent that reasonable or good faith actuarial estimates are used for 
pricing, such estimates will be deemed acceptable and, if inaccurate, 
will not constitute defective pricing.

[70 FR 41151, July 18, 2005]


<R05>
Sec. 2115.404-70  Profit.

    (a) Risk charge. (1) Section 8711(d) of title 5, United States Code, 
provides for payment of a risk charge to FEGLI Program contractors as 
compensation for the risk assumed under the FEGLI Program. It is 
appropriate to pay such a charge when substantial risk is borne by the 
contractor; that is, when the balance in the Employees' Life Insurance 
Fund is no larger than five times annual claims.
    (2) The risk charge is determined by agreement between the 
contractor and OPM. The amount of risk charge shall be specified in the 
contract.
    (b) Waiver of the risk charge. (1) When the Fund balance is greater 
than five times annual claims, OPM and the contractor may agree that the 
contractor will relinquish the risk charge in favor of a profit 
opportunity in the form of a

[[Page 412]]

service charge for the contractor. The service charge so determined 
shall be the total service charge that may be negotiated for the 
contract and shall encompass any service charge (whether entitled 
service charge, profit, fee, contribution to surpluses, etc.) that may 
have been negotiated by the prime contractor with any subcontractor. At 
no time may both a risk charge and a service charge be paid for the same 
portion of a policy year.
    (2) Once agreement to relinquish the risk charge is made, the 
agreement may not be cancelled unless OPM and the Contractor mutually 
agree to reinstitute payment of a risk charge; or unless the Fund 
balance falls below the level defined in 2115.404-70(a) and 30 days' 
notice of cancellation is provided; or unless the Contractor or OPM 
provides notice of cancellation for any reason 1 year prior to the date 
cancellation is sought.
    (c) Any profit prenegotiation objective (service charge) will be 
determined on the basis of a weighted guidelines structured approach.

[58 FR 40375, July 28, 1993. Redesignated and amended at 70 FR 41151, 
July 18, 2005]


<R05>
Sec. 2115.404-71  Profit analysis factors.

    (a) The OPM Contracting Officer will apply a weighted guidelines 
method when developing the prenegotiation objective (service charge) for 
the FEGLI Program contract. In accordance with the factors defined in 
FAR 15.404-4(d), OPM will apply the appropriate weights derived from the 
ranges specified in paragraph (b) of this section and will determine the 
prenegotiation objective based on the total dollar amount of the 
Contractor's Basic and Option C (family optional insurance) claims paid 
in the previous contract year.
    (1) Contractor performance. OPM will consider such elements as the 
accurate and timely processing of benefit claims, the volume and 
validity of complaints received by OPM, effectiveness of internal 
controls systems in place, the timeliness and adequacy of reports on 
operations, and responsiveness to OPM offices, enrollees, beneficiaries, 
and Congress as measures of economical and efficient contract 
performance. This factor will be judged apart from the Contractor's 
basic responsibility for contract compliance and will be a measure of 
the extent and nature of the Contractor's contribution to the FEGLI 
Program through the application of managerial expertise and effort. 
Evidence of effective contract performance will receive a plus weight, 
and poor performance or failure to comply with contract terms and 
conditions a zero weight. Innovations of benefit to the FEGLI Program 
will generally receive a plus weight; documented inattention or 
indifference to effective operations, a zero weight.
    (2) Contract cost risk. OPM will evaluate the Contractor's risk 
annually in relation to the amount in the Employees' Life Insurance Fund 
and will evaluate this factor accordingly.
    (3) Federal socioeconomic programs. OPM will consider documented 
evidence of successful Contractor-initiated efforts to support such 
Federal socioeconomic programs as drug and substance abuse deterrents 
and other concerns of the type enumerated in FAR 15.404-4(d)(1)(iii) as 
a factor in negotiating profit. This factor will be related to the 
quality of the Contractor's policies and procedures and the extent of 
exceptional effort or achievement demonstrated. Evidence of effective 
support of Federal socioeconomic programs will result in a plus weight; 
indifference to Federal socioeconomic programs will result in a zero 
weight; and only deliberate failure to provide opportunities to persons 
and organizations that would benefit from these programs will result in 
a negative weight.
    (4) Capital investments. This factor is generally not applicable to 
FEGLI Program contracts because facilities capital cost of money may be 
an allowable administrative expense. Generally, this factor will be 
given a weight of zero. However, special purpose facilities or 
investment costs of direct benefit to the FEGLI Program that are not 
recoverable as allowable or allocable administrative expenses may be 
taken into account in assigning a plus weight.
    (5) Cost control. This factor is based on the Contractor's 
previously demonstrated ability to perform effectively and economically. 
In addition, consideration will be given to measures taken

[[Page 413]]

by the Contractor that result in productivity improvements and other 
cost containment accomplishments that will be of future benefit to the 
FEGLI Program. Examples are containment of costs associated with 
processing claims; success at preventing waste, loss, unauthorized use, 
or misappropriation of FEGLI Program assets; and success at limiting and 
recovering erroneous benefit payments.
    (6) Independent development. Consideration will be given to 
independent Contractor-initiated efforts, such as the development of a 
unique and enhanced customer support system, that are of demonstrated 
value to the FEGLI Program and for which developmental costs have not 
been recovered directly or indirectly through allowable or allocable 
administrative expenses. This factor will be used to provide additional 
profit opportunities based upon an assessment of the Contractor's 
investment and risk in developing techniques, methods, practices, etc., 
having viability to the Program at large. Improvements and innovations 
recognized and rewarded under any other profit factor cannot be 
considered.
    (7) Transitional services. This factor is based on the Contractor's 
performance of transitional activities during a continuity of services 
period as described in the clause at 2152.237-70 of this chapter. These 
are any activities apart from the normal servicing of the contract 
during an active contract term. Other than for a transitional period, 
the weight applied to this factor for any active contract term is zero.
    (b) The weight ranges for each factor to be used in the weighted

<R05>
Sec. 2116.105  Solicitation provision.

    FAR 16.105 has no practical application because the statutory 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. chapter 87 obviate the issuance of solicitations.

                  Subpart 2116.2_Fixed-Price Contracts


<R05>
Sec. 2116.270  FEGLI Program contracts.

    FEGLI Program contracts are fixed price with limited cost 
redetermination plus fixed fee. The premium paid to the Contractor is 
mutually agreed upon by OPM and the Contractor and is based on an 
estimate of benefits and administrative costs, plus the fixed service or 
risk charge, and is determined annually. Claims costs, including 
benefits and administrative expenses, in excess of premiums are paid up 
to the amount in the Employees' Life Insurance Fund. Payment for costs 
exceeding the amount in the Fund are the responsibility of the 
Contractor and reinsurers. The fee is fixed at the inception of each 
contract year. The fee does not vary with the actual costs but may be 
adjusted as a result of changes in the work to be performed under the 
contract. The fee is in the

[[Page 414]]

form of either a risk charge or a service charge.
    (a) Risk charge. The risk charge will be determined as prescribed in 
5 U.S.C. 8711(d) and section 2115.404-70 of this chapter. It will 
consist of a negotiated amount which will reflect the risk assumed by 
the Contractor and the reinsurers and may be adjusted as a result of 
increased or decreased risk under the contract. When the applicable fee 
is a risk charge, no service charge will be paid for the same period of 
time.
    (b) Service charge. The amount of the service charge will be 
determined using a weighted guidelines structured approach in accordance 
with section 2115.404-71 of this chapter and negotiated with the 
Contractor at the beginning of the contract term. When the applicable 
fee is a service charge, no risk charge will be paid for the same period 
of time.

word ``solicitation'' to ``contract'' wherever they appear in the text 
to reflect the FEGLI Program's statutory exemption from competitive 
bidding (5 U.S.C. 8709), which obviates the issuance of solicitations.

    Records retained by FEGLI Program contractors on Federal insureds 
and members of their families serve the contractors' own commercial 
function of paying FEGLI Program claims and are not maintained to 
accomplish an agency function of OPM. Consequently, the records do not 
fall within the provisions of the Privacy Act. Nevertheless, OPM

confidential. The clause at 2152.224-70 addresses this concern.

    (a) 5 U.S.C. 8714(c)(1) prohibits the imposition of taxes, fees, or 
other monetary payment on FEGLI Program premiums by any State, the 
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any political 
subdivision or governmental authority of those entities.

the contractor from the imposition, payment, or collection of a tax, 
fee, or other monetary payment on the net income or profit accruing to 
or realized by it from business conducted under the FEGLI Program if the 
tax, fee, or payment is applicable to a broad range of business

a claimed exemption exists, the seller will be furnished evidence of 
exemption if requested by the contractor and approved by the contracting 
officer or at the discretion of the contracting officer.

    (a) Costs of media messages are allowable if approved by the 
contracting officer and all of the following criteria are met:
    (1) The primary objective of the message is to disseminate 
information on general health and fitness or encouraging healthful 
lifestyles;
    (2) The costs of the contractor's messages are allocated to all 
underwritten and non-underwritten lines of business; and
    (3) The contracting officer approves the total dollar amount of the 
contractor's messages to be charged to the FEGLI Program in advance of 
the policy year.
    (b) Costs of media messages that inform enrollees about the FEGLI 
Program are allowable if approved by the contracting officer.
    (c) In those instances where contracting officer approval of the 
total dollar amount is not solicited in advance, it is incumbent upon 
the contractor to show the contracting officer, for subsequent approval, 
that the costs

[[Page 418]]

are reasonable and do not unduly burden the administrative cost to the 
contract.
    (d) Costs of messages that are intended to, or which have the 
primary effect of, calling favorable attention to the contractor or 
subcontractor for the purpose of enhancing its overall image or selling 
its product or services are not allowable.


<R05>
Sec. 2131.205-3  Bad debts.

    Erroneous benefit payments. If the contractor or OPM determines that 
a FEGLI Program benefit has been paid in error for any reason, the 
contractor shall make a diligent effort to recover such erroneous 
payment from the recipient. The contracting officer shall allow an 
unrecovered erroneous payment to be charged to the contract provided the 
contractor demonstrates that the recovery of the erroneous payment was 
attempted in accordance with a system that is approved under 2146.270(b) 
and that either a diligent effort was made to recover the erroneous 
overpayment or it would not be cost effective to recover the erroneous 
overpayment. The contractor's compliance with a system that is approved 
under 2146.270(b) will be deemed to be a diligent effort to recover the 
erroneous overpayment.

Sec. 2131.205-41  Taxes.

    (a) FAR 31.205-41, as modified in paragraphs (b) through (e), is 
applicable to contracts in the FEGLI Program.
    (b) As long as 5 U.S.C. 8714(c) or other Federal law prohibits the 
imposition of taxes, fees, or other monetary payments on FEGLI Program 
premiums by any State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, or any other political subdivision or governmental 
authority of those entities, payment of such preempted tax is an 
unallowable expense under FAR 31.205-41(b)(3).
    (c) Paragraph (b)(1) of FAR 31.205-41 is not applicable to the FEGLI 
Program.
    (d) Notwithstanding any other provision in FAR 31.205-41, the 
portion of the contractor's income or excess profits taxes allocated to 
the FEGLI Program, except those allocated to the risk charge or the 
service charge, are allowable costs under the FEGLI Program, including 
any income or excess profit taxes that arise from the operation of this 
paragraph. Income or excess profits taxes allocated to the risk charge 
or the service charge are not allowable costs.
    (e) Notwithstanding any other provision in FAR 31.205-41, an amount 
equal to the ``DAC Tax'' is an allowable tax expense under FAR 31.205-
41. ``DAC Tax'' means an amount equal to: (1) the amount of the 
contractor's Federal, state, and local income tax allocated to payments 
under the FEGLI Program, less (2) the amount of the contractor's 
Federal, state, and local income tax allocated to payments under the 
FEGLI Program computed without regard to the operation of 26 U.S.C. 848, 
which requires that certain policy acquisition expenses be capitalized 
over a 60- or 120-month period, plus (3) the amount of the increase, if 
any,

[[Page 419]]

in the contractor's Federal, state, and local income tax that results 
from the operation of this section 2131.205-41(e).


<R05>
Sec. 2131.205-43  Trade, business, technical and professional activity 
          costs.

    (a) FEGLI Program contractors shall seek the advance written 
approval of the contracting officer for allowability of all or part of 
the costs associated with trade, business, technical, and professional 
activities when the allocable costs of such participation to the FEGLI 
Program will exceed $2,500 annually and the contractor allocates more 
than 50 percent of the membership cost of a trade, business, technical, 
or professional organization to the FEGLI Program.
    (b) When approval of costs for membership in an organization is 
required, the contractor must demonstrate conclusively that membership 
in such an organization and participation in its activities extend 
beyond the contractual relationship with OPM, have a reasonable 
relationship to providing services to FEGLI Program insureds, and that 
the organization is not engaged in activities such as those cited in FAR 
31.205-22 (lobbying costs) for which costs are not allowable.


<R05>
Sec. 2131.205-70  Major subcontractor service charge.

    In a subcontract for enrollment and eligibility determinations, 
administration of claims and payment of benefits and any other 
subcontract for which prior approval is necessary, when costs are 
determined on the basis of actual costs incurred, any amount that 
exceeds the allowable cost of a major subcontract (whether entitled 
service charge, incentive fee, profit, fee, surplus, or any other title) 
is not allowable under the contract. Amounts which exceed allowable 
costs may be paid to a major subcontractor only from the risk charge or 
service charge negotiated between OPM and the contractor.


<R05>
Sec. 2131.205-71  Reinsurer administrative expense costs.

    A charge of $500 per policy year per reinsurer of the FEGLI Program 
as set forth in the contract is an allowable cost when documented 
through an internal accounting entry of the contractor and actually 
paid. This amount is deemed to be sufficient to reimburse reinsurers for 
the minor administrative expenses incurred in reinsuring the FEGLI 
Program.

<R05>
Sec. 2132.170  Recurring premium payments to Contractors.

    (a) OPM will make payments on a letter of credit (LOC) basis. OPM 
and the Contractor will concur on an estimate of benefits and 
administrative costs plus the fixed service or risk charge for the 
forthcoming contract year, as specified in the contract. The annual 
premium to the Contractor, based on this estimate, will be credited to 
the Contractor's LOC account in 12 equal monthly installments due on the 
first business day of each month and available for drawdown. OPM will 
credit the Contractor's LOC account for the December payment no later 
than the last business day of each calendar year.

[[Page 420]]

Following the close of the contract year, a reconciliation of premiums, 
benefits, and other costs will be performed as a limited cost 
redetermination. In addition, interest distribution payments will be 
made available for Contractor drawdown from the LOC account. The 
Contractor will use the LOC account in accordance with guidelines issued 
by OPM.
    (b) Withdrawals from the LOC account for benefit costs of $5,000 or 
more will be made on a claims-paid basis. Withdrawals from the LOC 
account for benefit costs of less than $5,000 and other FEGLI Program 
disbursements will be made on a checks-presented basis. Under a checks-
presented basis, drawdown on the LOC is delayed until the checks issued 
for FEGLI Program disbursements are presented to the Contractor's bank 
for payment.
    (c) Nothing in this chapter will affect the ability of the 
Contractor to hold the special contingency reserve established and 
maintained in accordance with the terms of 5 U.S.C. 8712.

Report must be supported by the Contractor's books and records.
    (b) This requirement may be modified by the Contracting Officer in

accounting and other controls are in effect. If the requirement is 
modified, such modification will remain in effect until rescinded by

Sec. 2137.102  Policy.

    (a) The services under this contract are of vital interest to the 
Government and must be continued without interruption in the event the 
contract is terminated, unless the termination occurs as a result of 
OPM's failure to pay premiums on a timely basis.
    (b) The Contractor will be reimbursed for all reasonable phase-in 
and phase-out costs (i.e., costs incurred within the agreed-upon period 
after contract termination that result from phase-in and phase-out 
operations). The Contractor also will receive a risk or service charge 
for the full period after contract termination during which services are 
continued, not to exceed a pro rata portion of the risk or service 
charge for the final contract year. In addition, OPM will pay the 
Contractor an incentive amount, not to exceed the pro rata risk or 
service charge for the continuity of services period (LIFAR 2152.237-
70), based on exceptional performance during the transition period to a 
new Contractor. The Contracting Officer will use the weighted guidelines 
method described in 2115.404-71 of this chapter in determining the 
incentive amount. The amount of the risk or service charge will be based 
upon the accurate and timely processing of benefit claims, the volume 
and validity of customer service complaints, the timeliness and adequacy 
of reports on operations, and responsiveness to OPM offices, insured 
individuals, beneficiaries, and Congress.

contract's quality requirements.
    (b) OPM will make an initial evaluation of the Contractor's system 
of internal controls under the quality assurance program required by 
2146.270 of this chapter and will acknowledge in writing whether or not 
the system is consistent with the requirements set forth in this 
subpart. After the initial review, subsequent periodic reviews may be 
limited to changes in the Contractor's internal control guidelines.

[[Page 424]]

However, a limited review does not diminish the Contractor's obligation 
to apply the full internal control system.

<R05>
Sec. 2146.270  FEGLI Program quality assurance requirements.

    (a) The contractor shall develop and apply a quality assurance 
program specifying procedures for assuring contract quality, as directed 
by the contracting officer. At a minimum, the program should include 
procedures to address:
    (1) Accuracy of payments and recovery of overpayments;
    (2) Timeliness of payments to beneficiaries;
    (3) Quality of services and responsiveness to beneficiaries;
    (4) Quality of service and responsiveness to OPM; and
    (5) Detection and recovery of fraudulent claims.
    (b) The Contractor must prepare overpayment recovery guidelines to 
include a system of internal controls.
    (c) The contracting officer may order the correction of a deficiency 
or a modification in the contractor's services and/or quality assurance 
program. The contractor shall take the necessary action promptly to 
implement the contracting officer's order. If the contracting officer 
orders the correction of a deficiency or a modification of the 
contractor's services and/or quality assurance program pursuant to this 
paragraph after the contract year has begun, the costs incurred in 
correcting the deficiency or making the modification will not be 
considered to the contractor's detriment in the cost control factor of 
the service charge [if applicable] for the following contract year. 
However, if there is a deficiency, the deficiency itself may be taken 
into consideration.

<R05>
Sec. 2149.002  Applicability.

    (a) Termination. (1) Termination of FEGLI Program contracts is 
controlled by 5 U.S.C. 8709(c) and this chapter. The procedures for 
termination of FEGLI Program contracts are contained in FAR part 49. For 
the purpose of this part, terminate means to discontinue as used in 5 
U.S.C. 8709(c).
    (2) A life insurance contract entered into by OPM may be terminated 
by OPM at any time for default by the Contractor in accordance with the 
provisions of FAR part 49 and FAR 52.249-8. A life insurance contract 
entered into by OPM may be terminated by the Contractor at the end of 
the grace period, after default for nonpayment by OPM. Notwithstanding 
the preceding sentence, the Contractor will allow OPM an additional 5 
days after the end of the grace period to make payment if the failure to 
make payment was inadvertent and/or due to circumstances beyond the 
Government's control.
    (3) A life insurance contract entered into by OPM may be terminated 
for convenience of the Government 60 days after the Contractor's receipt 
of OPM's written notice to terminate.
    (4) The Contractor may terminate its contract with OPM at the end of 
any contract year when notice of intent to terminate is given to OPM in 
writing at least 60 days prior to the end of the contract year (i.e., no 
later than July 31).
    (b) Continuation of services. The services under this contract are 
of vital interest to the Government and must be continued without 
interruption in the event the contract is terminated for

[[Page 425]]

the Contractor's default or OPM's convenience. Consequently, the 
contract termination procedures contained in this paragraph must be used 
in conjunction with section 2137.102 of this chapter, section 2137.110 
of this chapter, and the provisions of the ``Continuity of Services'' 
clause at 2152.237-70 of this chapter. The Contractor is not required to 
continue performance subsequent to OPM's default for failure to pay 
premiums in accordance with the provisions of the clause at 2152.249-
70(b) of this chapter.
    (c) Settlement. The procedures for settlement of contracts after 
they are terminated are those contained in FAR part 49.

    As prescribed in 2109.409(a), the contracting officer may require a 
potential contractor to provide the following certification:

 Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Proposed Debarment, and 
                 Other Responsibility Matters (OCT 1993)

    (a)(1) The undersigned certifies, to the best of its knowledge and 
belief, that--
    (i) The undersigned and/or any of its Principals--
    (A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for 
debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any 
Federal agency;

[[Page 428]]

    (B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a 3-year period preceding this 
certification, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered 
against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in 
connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public 
(Federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal 
or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or 
commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or 
destruction of records, making false statements, or receiving stolen 
property; and
    (C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise 
criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission 
of any of the offenses enumerated in subdivision (a)(2) of this clause.
    (ii) The undersigned has ( ) has not ( ), within a 3-year period 
preceding this certification, had one or more contracts terminated for 
default by any Federal agency.
    (2) ``Principals,'' for the purposes of this certification, means 
officers; directors; owners; partners; and persons having primary 
management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity 
(e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, 
or business segment, and similar positions).
    This certification concerns a matter within the jurisdiction of an 
agency of the United States and the making of a false, fictitious, or 
fraudulent certification may render the undersigned subject to 
prosecution under section 1001, title 18, United States Code.
    (b) The undersigned shall provide immediate written notice to the 
Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to the contract award, the 
undersigned learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted 
or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
    (c) A certification that any of the actions mentioned in paragraph 
(a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in the 
withholding of an award under a contract under the FEGLI Program. 
However, the certification, or the undersigned's failure to provide such 
additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer will be 
considered in connection with a determination of the undersigned's 
responsibility under LIFAR subpart 2109.70, Minimum Standards for FEGLI 
Program Contractors.
    (d) Nothing contained in this certification shall be construed to 
require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good 
faith, the certification required by paragraph (a). The knowledge and 
information of the undersigned is not required to exceed that which is 
normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of 
business dealings.
    (e) The certification in (a) is a material representation of fact 
upon which reliance is placed during negotiation of a FEGLI Program 
contract. If it is later determined that the undersigned knowingly 
rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies 
available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the 
contract resulting from this certification for default.

or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or 
commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or 
destruction of records, making false statements, or receiving stolen 
property; and
    (C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise 
criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission 
of any of the offenses enumerated in subdivision (a)(2) of this clause.
    (ii) The Contractor has ( ) has not ( ), within a 3-year period 
preceding this certification, had one or more contracts terminated for 
default by any Federal agency.

officers; directors; owners; partners; and persons having primary 
management or supervisory responsibilities

within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of 
a subsidiary, division, or business segment, and similar positions).
    This certification concerns a matter within the jurisdiction of an 
agency of the United States and the making of a false, fictitious, or 
fraudulent certification may render the Contractor subject to 
prosecution under section 1001, title 18, United States Code.
    (b) The Contractor shall provide immediate written notice to the 
Contracting Officer if, at any time, the Contractor learns that its 
certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by 
reason of changed circumstances.
    (c) A Contractor's certification that any of the actions mentioned 
in the certification exists will not necessarily result in termination 
of the contract. However, the certification, or the Contractor's failure 
to provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting 
Officer will be considered in connection with a determination of the 
Contractor's responsibility under LIFAR subpart 2109.70, Minimum 
Standards for FEGLI Program Contractors.
    (d) Nothing contained in the certification shall be construed to 
require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good 
faith, the certification required by this section. The knowledge and 
information of the Contractor is not required to exceed that which is 
normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of 
business dealings.
    (e) The certification in this section is a material representation 
of fact upon which reliance is placed by the Contracting Officer in 
making this contract. If it is later determined that the Contractor 
knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other 
remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may 
terminate the contract for default.

earned, at the rate(s) specified in paragraph (d) of this clause, had it 
not been for the Contractor's noncompliance. Failed to comply with 
paragraph (a) or (b) of this clause means:
    (1) Making any charges against the contract which are not actual, 
allowable, allocable, or reasonable; or
    (2) Failing to credit any income due the contract and/or failing to 
place funds on hand, including premium payments and payments from OPM

investments and accounts.
    (d)(1) Investment income lost as a result of unallowable, 
unallocable, or unreasonable charges against the contract shall be paid 
from the 1st day of the contract term following the contract term in 
which the unallowable charge was made and shall end on the earlier of: 
(i) The date the amounts are returned to OPM; (ii) the date specified by 
the Contracting Officer; or, (iii) the date of the Contracting Officer's 
Final Decision.
    (2) Investment income lost by the Contractor as a result of failure 
to credit income due under the contract or failure to place funds on 
hand in income-producing investments and accounts must be paid from the 
date the funds should have been invested or appropriate income was not 
credited and will end on the earlier of:
    (i) The date the amounts are returned to OPM;
    (ii) The date specified by the Contracting Officer; or
    (iii) The date of the Contracting Officer's final decision.
    (3) The Contractor shall credit to the FEGLI Program income that is 
due in accordance with this clause. All amounts payable shall bear lost 
investment income compounded semiannually at the rate established by the 
Secretary of the Treasury as provided in section 12 of the Contract 
Disputes Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-563), during the periods specified in 
paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2).
    (4) All amounts due and unpaid after the periods specified in 
paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) shall bear simple interest at the rate 
applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Secretary of the 
Treasury until the amount is paid [see FAR 32.614-1].

in proportion to the seriousness of the event, to protect the interest 
of insureds, including, but not limited to--
    (1) Directing the Contractor to take corrective action; or
    (2) Making a downward adjustment to the weight in the ``Contractor 
Performance'' factor of the service charge.
    (c) Prior to taking action as described in paragraph (b) of this 
clause, OPM will notify the Contractor and offer an opportunity to 
respond.
    (d) The Contractor agrees to insert this clause in any subcontract

modification that is charged to the FEGLI Program contract exceeds 
$550,000 and is at least 25 percent of the total cost of the 
subcontract.

Sec. 2152.231-70  Accounting and allowable cost.

    As prescribed in 2131.270, insert the following clause:

                ACCOUNTING AND ALLOWABLE COST (OCT 2005)

    (a) Annual Financial Report. (1) The Contractor must prepare 
annually a financial report summarizing the financial operations of the 
FEGLI Program for the previous contract year. This report will be due to 
OPM in accordance with a date established by OPM's requirements.
    (2) The Contractor must have the most recent financial report for 
the FEGLI Program audited by an independent public accounting firm that 
ascribes to the standards of the American Institute of Certified Public 
Accountants. The audit must be performed in accordance with Generally 
Accepted Government Auditing Standards or other requirements issued by 
OPM. The report by the independent accounting firm on its audit must be 
submitted to OPM along with the annual financial report.
    (3) Based on the results of either the independent audit or a 
Government audit, the FEGLI contract may be:
    (i) Adjusted by amounts found not to constitute chargeable costs; or
    (ii) Adjusted for prior overpayments or underpayments.
    (b) Definition of costs. (1) A cost is chargeable to the contract 
for a contract term if it is:
    (i) An actual, allowable, allocable, and reasonable cost;
    (ii) Incurred with proper justification and accounting support;
    (iii) Determined in accordance with subpart 31.2 of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and subpart 2131.2 of the Federal 
Employees' Group Life Insurance Acquisition Regulation (LIFAR) 
applicable on October 1 of each year; and
    (iv) Determined in accordance with the terms of this contract.
    (2) In the absence of specific contract terms to the contrary, 
contract costs will be classified in accordance with the following 
criteria:
    (i) Benefits. Claims costs consist of payments made and costs 
incurred (including

[[Page 432]]

delayed settlement interest) by the Contractor for life insurance, 
accidental death and dismemberment insurance, excess mortality charges, 
post-mortem conversion charges, and conversion policies on behalf of 
insured persons, less any overpayments recovered (subject to the terms 
of LIFAR 2131.205-3), refunds, or other credits received.
    (ii)(A) Administrative expenses. Administrative expenses consist of 
chargeable costs as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause incurred 
in the adjudication of claims or incurred in the Contractor's overall 
operation of the business. Unless otherwise provided in the contract, 
FAR, or LIFAR, administrative expenses include, but are not limited to, 
taxes, service charges to reinsurers, the cost of investigation and 
settlement of policy claims, the cost of maintaining records regarding 
payment of claims, and legal expenses incurred in the litigation of 
benefit payments. Administrative expenses exclude the expenses related 
to investment income in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this clause.
    (B) Administrative Expense Ceiling. Each year an administrative 
expense ceiling for the following contract year is calculated based on 
the prior contract year's administrative expense ceiling, adjusted by 
the percentage change in the average monthly consumer Price Index for 
All Urban Consumers for the preceding 12 months. Administrative expenses 
are reimbursed up to the administrative expense ceiling or actual costs, 
whichever is less. Both parties will reexamine the base, including the 
prior year's actual expenses, at the request of either OPM or the 
Contractor. Within the administrative expense ceiling is a separately 
negotiated limit for indirect costs that may be charged against the 
ceiling for the contract year. The Contractor agrees to provide annually 
to the Contracting Officer a detailed report of direct and indirect 
administrative costs which form the basis for determining the limit on 
indirect costs for the following contract year. During a continuity of 
services period, OPM and the Contractor will negotiate a one-time 
increase in the administrative expense ceiling to cover phase-in/phase-
out costs. Costs that exceed the revised ceiling must be submitted by 
the Contractor, in writing and in advance of their incurrence, to the 
Contracting Officer for approval.
    (iii) Investment income. Investment income represents the amount 
earned by the Contractor after deducting chargeable investment expenses. 
Investment expenses are those chargeable contract costs, as defined in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, which are attributable to the 
investment of FEGLI funds.
    (c) Certification of Annual Financial Report. (1) The Contractor 
must certify the annual financial report in the form set forth in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this clause. The certificate must be signed by the 
chief executive officer for the Contractor's FEGLI Program operations 
and the chief financial officer for the Contractor's FEGLI Program 
operations and must be returned with the annual financial report.
    (2) The certification required must be in the following form:

                CERTIFICATION OF ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT

    This is to certify that I have reviewed this financial report and, 
to the best of my knowledge and belief, attest that:
    1. The report was prepared in conformity with the guidelines issued 
by the Office of Personnel Management and fairly presents the financial 
results of this contract year in conformity with those guidelines;
    2. The costs included in the report are actual, allowable, 
allocable, and reasonable in accordance with the terms of the contract 
and with the cost principles of the Federal Employees' Group Life 
Insurance Program Acquisition Regulation (LIFAR) and the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (FAR);
    3. Income, overpayments, refunds, and other credits made or owed in 
accordance with the terms of the contract and applicable cost principles 
have been included in the report.

    (a) OPM will make available to the Contractor, in full settlement of 
its obligations under this contract, subject to adjustment based on 
actual claims and administrative cost, a fixed premium once per month on 
the first business day of the month. The premium is determined by an 
estimate of costs for the contract year as provided in Section-------- 
and is redetermined annually by mutual agreement of OPM and the 
Contractor. In addition, an annual reconciliation of premiums, benefits, 
and other costs is performed, and additional payment by OPM or 
reimbursement by the Contractor is paid as necessary.

[[Page 433]]

    (b) If OPM fails to fund the Letter of Credit (LOC) account for the 
full amount of premium due by the due date, a grace period of 31 days 
will be granted to OPM for providing any premium due, unless OPM has 
previously given written notice to the Contractor that the contract is 
to be discontinued. The contract will continue in force during the grace 
period.
    (c) If OPM fails to fund the LOC account for any premiums within the 
grace period, the contract may be terminated at the end of the 31st day 
of the grace period in accordance with LIFAR 2149.002(a)(2). If during 
the grace period OPM presents written notice to the Contractor that the 
contract is to be terminated before the expiration of the grace period, 
the contract will be terminated the later of the date of receipt of such 
written notice by the Contractor or the date specified by OPM for 
termination. In either event, OPM will be liable to the Contractor for 
all premiums then due and unpaid.
    (d) In accordance with LIFAR 2143.205 and LIFAR 2252.243-70, 
Changes, if a change is made to the contract that increases or decreases 
the cost of performance of the work under this contract, the Contracting 
Officer will make an equitable adjustment to the payments under this 
contract.
    (e) In the event this contract is terminated in accordance with 
LIFAR part 2149, the special contingency reserve held by the Contractor 
will be available to pay the necessary and proper charges against this 
contract after other Program assets held by the Contractor are 
exhausted.

requested, and approved by the Contracting Officer, in advance of any 
change, and the Contractor must demonstrate that accounting techniques 
have been established that clearly measure FEGLI Program cash and 
investment income (i.e., subsidiary ledgers). Reconciliations between 
amounts reported and actual amounts shown in accounting records must be 
provided as supporting schedules to the annual financial report.

approval of the Contracting Officer.
    (b) Unless a different period is specified in the Contracting 
Officer's written approval, an assignment of FEGLI Program funds shall 
be in force only for a period of 1 year from the date of the Contracting

    (a) The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract 
are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption. 
The Contractor further recognizes that upon contract expiration or 
termination, including termination by the Contractor for OPM's failure 
to make timely premium payments, a successor, either the Government or 
another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to furnish 
phase-in training and exercise its best efforts and cooperation to 
effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor.
    (b) The Contractor shall, upon the Contracting Officer's written 
notice, (1) furnish phase-in and phase-out services for up to 10 months 
after this contract expires and (2) negotiate in good faith a plan with 
a successor to determine the nature and extent of phase-in and phase-out 
services required. The plan shall specify a training program and a date 
for transferring responsibilities for each division of work described in 
the plan, and shall be subject to the Contracting Officer's approval. 
The Contractor shall provide sufficient experienced personnel during the 
phase-in and phase-out period to ensure that the services called for by 
this contract are maintained at the required level of proficiency.
    (c) The Contractor must allow as many experienced personnel as 
practicable to remain on the job during the transition period to help 
the successor maintain the continuity and consistency of the services 
required by

[[Page 434]]

this contract. The Contractor also must, except if prohibited by 
applicable law, disclose necessary personnel records and allow the 
successor to conduct onsite interviews with these employees. If selected 
employees are agreeable to the change, the Contractor must release them 
at a mutually agreeable date and negotiate transfer of their earned 
fringe benefits to the successor.
    (d) The Contractor will be reimbursed for all reasonable phase-in, 
phase-out costs (i.e., costs incurred within the agreed period after 
contract termination that result from phase-in and phase-out operations) 
in accordance with the provisions of the administrative expense ceiling 
in the clause at 2152.231-70(b)(2)(ii)(B) and a risk charge or a service 
charge (profit) not to exceed a pro rata portion of the risk or service 
charge under this contract. The amount of profit will be based upon the 
accurate and timely processing of benefit claims, the volume and 
validity of complaints received by OPM, the timeliness and adequacy of 
reports on operations, and responsiveness to OPM offices, enrollees, 
beneficiaries, and Congress. In setting the final profit figure, 
obstacles overcome by the Contractor during the phase-in and phase-out 
period will be taken into consideration. OPM will pay an incentive 
amount to the Contractor not to exceed the pro rata risk or service 
charge for the continuity of services period, if the Contractor has 
performed exceptionally during the transition period to a new 
Contractor. The Contracting Officer uses the weighted guidelines method 
described in LIFAR 2115.404-71 in determining the incentive amount.

    (e) Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a dispute under the 
Disputes clause. However, nothing in this clause shall excuse the 
Contractor from proceeding with the contract as changed.
    (f) The Contracting Officer shall not make any changes pursuant to

in the LIFAR before the effective date of the amendment as provided for

Sec. 2152.244-70  Subcontracts.

    As prescribed by 2144.204, insert the following clause:

                         Subcontracts (OCT 2005)

    (a) The Contractor must notify the Contracting Officer reasonably in 
advance of entering into any subcontract or subcontract modification, or 
as otherwise specified by this contract, when the cost of that portion 
of the subcontract that is charged the FEGLI Program contract exceeds 
$550,000 and is at least 25 percent of the total cost of the 
subcontract.
    (b) The advance notification required by paragraph (a) of this 
clause shall include the following information:
    (1) A description of the supplies or services to be subcontracted;
    (2) Identification of the type of subcontract to be used;
    (3) Identification of the proposed subcontract and an explanation of 
why and how the proposed subcontractor was selected, including the 
competition obtained;
    (4) The proposed subcontract price and the Contractor's cost or 
price analysis;
    (5) The subcontractor's current, complete, and accurate cost or 
pricing data and Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data, if 
required by other contract provisions.

[[Page 435]]

    (6) The subcontractor's Disclosure Statement or Certificate relating 
to Cost Accounting Standards when such data are required by other 
provisions of this contract; and
    (7) A negotiation memorandum reflecting--
    (i) The principal elements of the subcontract price negotiations;
    (ii) The most significant consideration controlling establishment of 
initial or revised prices;
    (iii) The reason cost or pricing data were or were not required;
    (iv) The extent, if any, to which the Contractor did not rely on the 
subcontractor's cost or pricing data in determining the price objective 
and in negotiating the final price;
    (v) The extent to which it was recognized in the negotiation that 
the subcontractor's cost or pricing data were not accurate, complete, or 
current; the action taken by the Contractor and the subcontractor; and 
the effect of any such defective data on the total price negotiated;
    (vi) The reasons for any significant difference between the 
Contractor's price objective and the price negotiated; and
    (vii) A complete explanation of the incentive fee or profit plan 
when incentives are used. The explanation shall identify each critical 
performance element, management decisions used to quantify each 
incentive element, reasons for the incentives, and a summary of all 
trade-off possibilities considered.
    (c) The Contractor shall obtain the Contracting Officer's written 
consent before placing any subcontract for which advance notification is 
required under paragraph (a) of this clause. However, the Contracting 
Officer may ratify in writing any such subcontract. Ratification shall 
constitute the consent of the Contracting Officer.
    (d) The Contracting Officer may waive the requirement for advance 
notification and consent required by paragraph (a), (b), and (c) of this 
clause where the Contractor and subcontractor submit an application or 
renewal as a contractor team arrangement as defined in FAR subpart 9.6 
and--
    (1) The Contracting Officer evaluated the arrangement during 
negotiation of the contract or contract renewal; and
    (2) The subcontractor's price and/or costs were included in the 
plan's rates that were reviewed and approved by the Contracting Officer 
during negotiations of the contract or contract renewal.
    (e) Unless the consent or approval specifically provides otherwise, 
consent by the Contracting Office to any subcontract shall not 
constitute a determination (1) of the acceptability of any subcontract 
terms or conditions; (2) of the allowability of any cost under this 
contract; or (3) to relieve the Contractor of any responsibility for 
performing this contract.
    (f) No subcontract placed under this contract will provide for 
payment on a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost basis. Any fee payable under 
cost reimbursement type subcontracts will not exceed the fee limitations 
in FAR 15.404-4(c)(4)(i). Any profit or fee payable under a subcontract 
will be in accordance with the provisions of Section --------.
    (g) The Contractor shall give the Contracting Officer immediate 
written notice of any action or suit filed and prompt notice of any 
claim made against the Contractor by any subcontractor or vendor that, 
in the opinion of the Contractor, may result in litigation related in 
any way to this contract with respect to which the Contractor may be 
entitled to reimbursement from the Government.

                             (End of clause)

right to inspect and test all services called for by the contract, to

Sec. 2152.249-70  Renewal and termination.

    As prescribed in 2149.505-70, insert the following clause:

[[Page 436]]

                   Renewal and Termination (OCT 2005)

    (a) This contract renews automatically each October 1st, unless 
written notice of termination is given by the Contractor not less than 
60 calendar days before the renewal date.
    (b) This contract may be terminated by OPM at any time in accordance 
with FAR part 49 and FAR 52.249-8 for default by the Contractor. This 
contract terminates at the end of the grace period if the Government 
does not fund the LOC account for any of the premium due to the 
Contractor (see LIFAR 2149.002(a)(2)). However, the Contractor and OPM 
may agree to continue the contract. In addition, the Contractor agrees 
to reinstate the contract if termination (1) arose out of the 
Government's inadvertent failure to fund the LOC account for the amount 
of the premium payment prior to the expiration of the grace period as 
defined in LIFAR 2102.101, and/or (2) was due to circumstances beyond 
the Government's control, provided that the LOC account is funded in the 
amount of the premium payment due to the Contractor within 5 days after 
the expiration of the grace period. In the event of such reinstatement, 
OPM will equitably adjust the payments due under the contract to 
compensate the Contractor for any increased costs of performance that 
result from the Government's failure to fund the LOC account prior to 
the expiration of the grace period and/or such reinstatement.
    (c) This contract may be terminated for convenience of the 
Government 60 days after the Contractor's receipt of OPM's written 
notice of termination.
    (d) Upon termination of the contract for Contractor's default or 
OPM's convenience, the Contractor agrees to assist OPM with an orderly 
and efficient transition to a successor in accordance with LIFAR 
2137.102, LIFAR 2137.110, and the provisions of the ``Continuity of 
Services'' clause at 2152.237-70. The Contractor is not required to 
continue performance subsequent to OPM's failure to fund the LOC account 
for premiums due under paragraph (b) of this clause.
    (e) After receipt of a termination notice, the prime Contractor 
shall, unless directed otherwise by the Contracting Officer, terminate 
all subcontracts to the extent that they relate to the performance of 
the FEGLI Program contract. The failure of the prime Contractor to 
include an appropriate termination clause in any subcontract, or to 
exercise the clause rights, shall not affect the Contracting Officer's 
right to require the termination of the subcontract; or increase the 
obligation of the Government beyond what it would have been if the 
subcontract had contained an appropriate clause.

                             (End of clause)

               Subpart 2301.1_Purpose, Authority, Issuance


<R05>
Sec. 2301.101  Purpose.

    (a) The Social Security Acquisition Regulation (SSAR) is issued to 
establish uniform acquisition policies and procedures for the Social 
Security Administration (SSA) which conform to the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) System.
    (b) The SSAR implements and supplements the FAR. (Implementing 
material expands upon or indicates the manner of compliance with related 
FAR material. Supplementing material refers to policies or procedures 
which have no corresponding counterpart in the FAR.)
    (c) The SSAR contains only formal agency policies and procedures 
which have a significant effect beyond SSA's internal operating 
procedures or which have a significant cost or administrative impact on 
contractors or offerors.


<R05>
Sec. 2301.103  Authority.

    The SSAR is prescribed under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 301 and 
section 205(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act 
of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 486(c)).


<R05>
Sec. 2301.104  Applicability.

    The FAR and SSAR apply to all SSA acquisitions as stated in FAR 
1.104. Unless specified otherwise, the FAR and SSAR apply to 
acquisitions within and outside the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 2301.105  Issuance.


<R05>
Sec. 2301.105-1  Publication and code ar-rangement.

    (a) The SSAR is also published in the same forms as indicated in FAR 
1.105-1(a).
    (b) The SSAR is issued in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) as 
Chapter 23 of Title 48, Social Security Acquisition Regulation (SSAR). 
It may be referenced as ``48 CFR chapter 23.''


<R05>
Sec. 2301.105-2  Arrangement of regulations.

    (a) General. The SSAR conforms to the FAR with respect to divisional 
arrangements; i.e., subchapters, parts, subparts, sections, subsections, 
and paragraphs.
    (b) Numbering. The FAR System of numbering permits the keying of the 
same or similar subject matter throughout Chapters 1 (FAR) and 23 (SSAR) 
of Title 48, CFR. However, SSA's system varies somewhat from that of the 
FAR numbering scheme, in the numbering to the left of the decimal point. 
Whereas the FAR only identifies the part number of 48 CFR to the left of 
the decimal point, our corresponding reference identifies the chapter as 
well. For example, the FAR paragraph corresponding to this SSAR 
paragraph is numbered 1.105-2(b) where ``1'' is the part number (may be 
one or two digits and is followed by a decimal point), ``1'' (to the 
right of the decimal point) is the subpart number, ``05'' (always two 
digits) is the section number, ``2'' is the subsection number (always 
hyphenated), and ``(b)'' is the paragraph reference. This SSAR reference 
is 2301.105-2(b) where the ``23'' is the chapter number assigned to SSA 
and the ``01'' represents the part number (part numbers will always be 
two digits for agencies implementing the FAR). The remaining numbers to 
the right of the decimal point are identical to and reflect the same 
divisions as in the FAR numbering scheme.

[[Page 442]]

    (c) References and citations. (1) Unless otherwise stated, 
references indicate parts, subparts, sections, subsections, etc., of 
this regulation, the SSAR.
    (2) This regulation shall be referred to as the Social Security 
Acquisition Regulation (SSAR). Any reference may be cited as ``SSAR'' 
followed by the appropriate number. Within the SSAR, the number alone 
will be used.
    (3) Citations of authority shall be incorporated where necessary. 
All FAR reference numbers shall be preceded by ``FAR.''

<R05>
Sec. 2401.000  Scope of part.

    This part describes the method by which the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development (HUD) implements, supplements and deviates from 
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) through the establishment of 
the HUD Acquisition Regulation (HUDAR), which prescribes the 
Department's procurement policies and procedures under the FAR System.

               Subpart 2401.1_Purpose, Authority, Issuance


<R05>
Sec. 2401.100  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart describes the HUDAR and states its relationship to the 
FAR System. This subpart also provides the explanation of the purpose 
and the authorities under which the HUDAR is issued.


<R05>
Sec. 2401.101  Purpose.

    The Department of Housing and Urban Development Acquisition 
Regulation is hereby established as chapter 24 of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation System (48 CFR chapter 24). It is issued to 
provide uniform Departmental policies and procedures for the acquisition 
of supplies, personal property and non-personal services by the 
Department's contracting activities and to make these policies and 
procedures readily available to Departmental personnel and to the 
public.


<R05>
Sec. 2401.103  Authority.

    The HUDAR is prescribed under section 7(d) of the Department of HUD 
Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(d)), section 205(c) of the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 486(c)), the general 
authorization in FAR 1.301, and the Secretary's delegations of 
procurement authority.

[71 FR 2434, Jan. 13, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 2401.104  Applicability.

    All acquisition of personal property and non-personal services 
(including construction) by HUD, except as may be otherwise authorized 
by law, must be accomplished in accordance with the HUDAR and the FAR.

<R05>
Sec. 2401.105  Issuance.


<R05>
Sec. 2401.105-2  Arrangement of regulations.

    (a) General. Chapter 24 is divided into parts, subparts, sections, 
subsections, paragraphs and further subdivisions as necessary.

[[Page 446]]

    (b) Numbering. Generally, the numbering system and part, subpart, 
and section titles used in the HUDAR conform with those used in the FAR 
or as follows:
    (1) When the HUDAR implements or deviates from a parallel part, 
subpart, section, subsection, or paragraph of the FAR, that 
implementation or deviation will be numbered and captioned where 
possible to correspond to the FAR part, subpart, section, subsection, or 
paragraph. For example, FAR subpart 1.4, Deviations, is implemented in 
HUD's acquisition regulations at subpart 2401.4, Deviations. (The ``24'' 
in the number indicates what chapter of title 48 contains the HUDAR.)
    (2) When HUD supplements material contained in the FAR, it is given 
a unique number containing the numerals ``70'' or higher. The rest of 
the number will parallel the FAR part, subpart, section, subsection, or 
paragraph it is supplementing. For example, FAR 14.407, Award, does not 
contain a provision for the steps to be taken when only one bid is 
received. The HUDAR provides this information. Since the subject matter 
supplements what is contained in FAR 14.407, the HUDAR section 
supplementing the FAR is numbered 2414.407-70.
    (3) Where material in the FAR requires no implementation or 
deviation, there is no corresponding numbering in the HUDAR. Therefore, 
there may be gaps in the HUDAR sequence of numbers where the FAR, as 
written, is applicable to the HUDAR and requires no further 
implementation.
    (c) Citation. The HUDAR will be cited in accordance with Federal 
Register standards approved for the FAR. Thus, this section when 
referred to in the HUDAR is cited as 2401.105-2(c). When this section is 
referred to formally in official documents, such as legal briefs, it 
should be cited as ``48 CFR 2401.105-2(c).'' Any section of the HUDAR 
may be formally identified by the section number, e.g., ``HUDAR 
2401.105-2.'' In the HUDAR, any reference to the FAR will be indicated 
by ``FAR'' followed by the section number, for example FAR 37.108.

<R05>
Sec. 2401.106  OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act.

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520) requires 
that Federal agencies obtain approval from the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) before collecting information from 10 or more persons. HUD 
has received approval from OMB to collect information under the 
provisions of its Acquisition Regulation. The OMB Approval Number is 
2535-0091.

              Subpart 2401.3_Agency Acquisition Regulations


<R05>
Sec. 2401.301  Policy.

    (a)(1) Implementation. The HUDAR implements and supplements the FAR. 
Implementation material is that which expands upon related FAR material. 
Supplementing material is that for which there is no counterpart in the 
FAR.


<R05>
Sec. 2401.302  Limitations.

    (c) Exclusions. Certain HUD policies and procedures which come 
within the scope of this chapter are not included in the HUDAR. Not 
included is a policy or procedure of an internal nature or which is 
expected to be effective for a period of less than six months.

                        Subpart 2401.4_Deviations


<R05>
Sec. 2401.403  Individual deviations.

    In individual cases, proposed deviations from the FAR or HUDAR shall 
be submitted to the Senior Procurement Executive (see 2401.601-70) for 
approval or other necessary or appropriate action. A supporting 
statement shall be submitted with the proposed deviation indicating 
briefly the nature of the deviation and the reasons for granting the 
deviation, consistent with FAR 1.402. The contract file shall include a 
copy of the request submitted

[[Page 447]]

and the approval. In emergency situations involving individual cases, 
deviation approvals may be processed by telephone and later confirmed in 
writing.

[49 FR 7697, Mar. 1, 1984, as amended at 51 FR 7948, Mar. 7, 1986; 53 FR 
46533, Nov. 17, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 2401.404  Class deviations.

    For deviations which affect more than one contracting action, 
proposed deviations from the FAR or HUDAR shall be submitted to the 
Senior Procurement Executive for approval or other necessary or 
appropriate action. Requests for deviations shall be supported by 
statements which fully disclose the nature of the deviation and the need 
there of. The Senior Procurement Executive will consider the proposal on 
an expedited basis and in the case of a proposed FAR deviation will 
comply with FAR 1.404.

Sec. 2401.601  General.


<R05>
Sec. 2401.601-70  Senior Procurement Executive.

    Unless otherwise designated by the Secretary through a delegation of 
authority, the Chief Procurement Officer is the Department's Senior 
Procurement Executive and is responsible for all departmental 
procurement policy, regulations, and procedures, and oversight of all 
HUD procurement operations. The Senior Procurement Executive is also 
responsible for the development of HUD's procurement system standards, 
evaluation of the system in accordance with approved criteria, 
enhancement of career management of the procurement workforce, and 
certification to the Secretary that the Department's procurement system 
meets approved criteria.

<R05>
Sec. 2401.602  Contracting Officers.


<R05>
Sec. 2401.602-3  Ratification of unauthorized commitments.

    (b)(1) Requests for ratification of unauthorized commitments arising 
in HUD Headquarters shall be submitted in writing to the Contracting 
Officer through the Chief Procurement Officer. The Assistant Secretary 
or equivalent official for the office that created the unauthorized 
commitment shall sign requests. Requests for ratification of 
unauthorized commitments arising in the field shall be submitted in 
writing to the Director of the cognizant FCO. The Director of the field-
based office that created the unauthorized commitment shall sign the 
request.
    (3) In accordance with FAR 1.602-3(b)(3), the Deputy Chief 
Procurement Officer is delegated authority to ratify unauthorized 
commitments arising in HUD Headquarters.
    (c)(5) Concurrence by legal counsel in the Contracting Officer's 
recommendation for payment of an unauthorized commitment (see FAR 1.602-
3(c)(5)) shall not be required when the value of the payment is equal 
to, or less than, the simplified acquisition threshold.

Sec. 2415.209  Solicitation provisions.

    (a) The Contracting Officer shall insert a provision substantially 
the same as the provision at 48 CFR 2452.215-70, Proposal Content, in 
all solicitations for negotiated procurements using the trade-off 
selection process expected to exceed the simplified acquisition 
threshold. The Contracting Officer shall adapt paragraph (c) of the 
provision (i.e., include, delete or further supplement subparagraphs) to 
address the particular requirements of the immediate solicitation. The 
provisions may be used in simplified acquisitions when it is necessary 
to obtain technical and management information in making the award 
selection. When award selection will be made through the lowest price 
technically acceptable method, the provision shall be used with its 
Alternate I. If the proposed contract requires work on or access to 
sensitive automated systems or applications (see the clause at 48 CFR 
2452.239-70), the

[[Page 457]]

provision shall be used with its Alternate II.

[64 FR 46095, Aug. 23, 1999]

                     Subpart 2415.3_Source Selection


<R05>
Sec. 2415.303  Responsibilities.

    (a) In accordance with FAR 15.303, the source selection authorities 
are designated as follows:
    (1) The Contracting Officer, for contracts awarded using the lowest 
price technically acceptable proposal process.
    (2) The Assistant Secretary or equivalent for the office initiating 
the procurement for contracts awarded using the tradeoff process. The 
Assistant Secretary or equivalent may delegate this function to 
appropriate departmental personnel.
    (3) For procurements for the performance of legal services by 
outside counsel using either the lowest price technically acceptable or 
tradeoff process, the General Counsel or his/her designee.
    (b) The technical requirements related to source selection shall be 
performed by a Technical Evaluation Panel (TEP). Generally, a TEP will 
consist of three to five members, with one member serving as the 
chairperson. For procurements involving technical complexity, the TEP 
may include advisors and committees to focus on specific technical areas 
or concerns. For relatively low dollar value and routine acquisitions of 
equipment, supplies or services, the TEP may consist of one technical 
representative. The TEP is responsible for documenting the evaluation of 
all proposals as appropriate to the source selection approach in use and 
for making the source selection recommendation to the source selection 
authority.

<R05>
Sec. 2415.304  Evaluation factors.

    (d)(1) The solicitation shall state the basis for the source 
selection decision as either ``lowest-price technically acceptable'' 
process (LPTA) or ``trade-off process'' (as defined at FAR subpart 
15.1).
    (2) When using the trade-off process, each technical evaluation 
factor and subfactor shall be assigned a numerical weight (except for 
pass-fail factors) which shall appear in the RFP. When using LPTA, each 
evaluation factor is applied on a ``pass-fail'' basis; numerical scores 
are not assigned. ``Pass-fail'' evaluation factors define a standard of 
comparison for solicitation/contract requirements which proposals either 
completely satisfy or fail to meet.

<R05>
Sec. 2415.305  Proposal evaluation.

    (a) After receipt of proposals, the Contracting Officer will forward 
copies of the technical portion of each proposal to the TEP Chairperson 
or his or her designee. The cost/price portion of each proposal shall be 
retained by the Contracting Officer pending initial technical evaluation 
by the TEP.
    (3) Technical evaluation. The TEP shall rate each proposal based on 
the evaluation factors specified in the solicitation. The TEP shall 
identify each proposal as being either acceptable, unacceptable but 
capable of being made acceptable, or unacceptable. A proposal shall be 
considered unacceptable if it is so clearly deficient that it cannot be 
corrected through written or oral discussions. Under the trade-off 
process, predetermined cut-off scores designed to determine a threshold 
level of acceptability of proposals shall not be employed. A technical 
evaluation report, which complies with FAR 15.305(a)(3), shall be 
prepared and signed by the technical evaluator(s), furnished to the 
contracting officer, and maintained as a permanent record in the 
official procurement file.

    It is the policy of the Department to foster and promote Minority 
Business Enterprise (MBE) participation in its procurement program, to 
the extent permitted by law and consistent with its primary mission. A 
``minority business enterprise'' is a business which is at least 51 
percent owned by one or more minority group members; or, in the case of 
a publicly-owned business, one in which at least 51 percent of its 
voting stock is owned by one or more minority group members, and whose 
management and daily business operations are controlled by one or more 
such individuals. For this purpose, minority group members are those 
groups of U.S. citizens found to be disadvantaged by the Small Business 
Administration pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act.

any tax. When a problem exists, the Contracting Officer shall request, 
in writing, the assistance of legal counsel. The request shall detail 
the problem and be accompanied by appropriate backup data. Counsel shall 
report to the Contracting Officer as to the necessary disposition of the 
tax problem. The Contracting Officer will notify the contractor of the 
outcome of the tax problem. Counsel is responsible for communications 
with the Department of Justice for representation or intervention in 
proceedings concerning taxes.

to provide background information and obtain a HUD building pass prior 
to working in the HUD facility.

(b)(1) to the GTR within five (5) calendar days after contract award or 
not later than five (5) calendar days before a covered employee will 
begin work at the HUD facility.
    (3) The information provided in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) 
will be used to perform a background check to determine the eligibility 
of the contractor employees to work in the HUD facility. After 
completion of such review, the GTR shall notify the contractor in 
writing of any contractor employees' ineligibility to work in the HUD 
facility. The contractor shall immediately remove such employees from 
work on this contract which requires the employees' physical presence in 
the HUD facility.
    (c) Building passes. (1) HUD will issue a building pass to each 
contractor employee determined to be eligible pursuant to the background 
check in paragraph (b). The Contractor shall provide the GTR with the 
names and Social Security numbers of all such employees. Contractor 
employees shall have their building passes on their persons at all times 
while working on HUD premises and shall present passes for inspection 
upon request by HUD officials or HUD security personnel.
    (2) Building passes shall identify individuals as contractor 
employees and shall have an expiration date not exceeding the current 
term of the contract. Passes shall be renewed for each succeeding

expiration of this contract, the contractor shall return to the GTR all 
building passes issued by HUD and not previously returned. The 
contractor is responsible for accounting for all passes issued to the 
contractor's employees.
    (d) Control of access. HUD shall have and exercise full and complete 
control over granting, denying, withholding, and terminating access of 
contractor employees to HUD facilities. The GTR will notify the 
contractor immediately when HUD has determined that an employee is 
unsuitable or unfit for his/her assigned contractual duties, and 
therefore will no longer be permitted access to the HUD facility. The 
contractor shall take immediate steps to remove such an employee from 
working on this contract and provide a suitable replacement.

all subcontracts where the requirements specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section are applicable to performance of the subcontract.

holiday or other premium compensation will be reimbursed either as a 
direct or indirect cost, unless authorized pursuant to an overtime 
clause elsewhere in this contract.
    (b)(1) HUD may close a HUD facility for all or a portion of a 
business day as a result of--
    (A) Granting administrative leave to non-essential HUD employees 
(e.g., unanticipated holiday);
    (B) Inclement weather;
    (C) Failure of Congress to appropriate operational funds;
    (D) Or any other reason.
    (2) In such cases, contractor personnel not classified as essential, 
i.e., not performing critical round-the-clock services or tasks, who are 
not already on duty at the facility shall not report to the facility. 
Such contractor personnel already present shall be dismissed and shall 
leave the facility.
    (3) The contractor agrees to continue to provide sufficient 
personnel to perform round-the-clock requirements of critical tasks 
already in operation or scheduled for performance during the period in 
which HUD employees are dismissed, and shall be guided by any specific 
instructions of the Contracting Officer or his/her duly authorized 
representative.
    (c) When contractor personnel services are not required or provided 
due to closure of a

[[Page 483]]

HUD facility as described in this clause, the contractor shall be 
compensated as follows--
    (1) For fixed-price contracts, deductions in the contractor's price 
will be computed as follows--
    (A) The deduction rate in dollars per day will be equal to the per 
month contract price divided by 21 days per month.
    (B) The deduction rate in dollars per day will be multiplied by the 
number of days services are not required or provided.
    If services are provided for portions of days, appropriate 
adjustment will be made by the Contracting Officer to ensure that the 
contractor is compensated for services provided.
    (2) For cost-reimbursement, time-and-materials and labor-hour type 
contracts, HUD shall not reimburse as direct costs, the costs of 
salaries or wages of contractor personnel for the period during which 
such personnel are dismissed from, or do not have access to, the 
facility.

    (a) General. This contract involves work on, or access to, [insert 
name or other identifier], a HUD information resource that is either a 
major application system or any general support system. A major 
application system is a mission critical system, a system or information 
resource which has high investment cost, or any system which contains 
Privacy Act-covered data. A general support system is any computer 
facility or major component thereof, or any network or 
telecommunications resource. All contractor employees working on this 
contract in positions which HUD has determined to have sensitive access 
to the information resource(s) identified above are required to have a 
background investigation. The investigation shall be commensurate with 
the risk and security controls involved in managing, using or operating 
the resources identified above, consistent with 5 CFR part 731. HUD may 
bar contractor employees from working on this contract for failing to 
meet or maintain the applicable suitability standards administered by 
the Department's Personnel Security Branch.
    (b) Citizenship-related requirements. All contractor employees as 
described in paragraph (a) shall: (1) be United States (U.S.) citizens 
living in the U.S.; or (2) owe allegiance to the U.S.
    (c) Background investigation process. (1) The GTR shall notify the 
contractor of those contractor employee positions requiring background 
investigations. For each contractor employee in such a position, the 
contractor shall submit the following completed forms: Standard Form 
(SF) 85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions; FD-258, Fingerprint 
Chart; Fair Credit Reporting Act authorization form; and other 
information as may be necessary. The contractor shall submit an original 
and one copy of the SF 85P.
    (2) The contractor shall deliver the forms and information required 
in paragraph (c)(1) to the GTR as soon as practicable once the 
contractor knows that the employee will be assigned to this contract, 
and no later than seven (7) calendar days after the employee begins work 
on this contract.
    (3) The investigation process shall consist of a range of personal 
background inquiries and contacts (written and personal) and 
verification of the information provided on the security forms described 
in paragraph (c)(1).
    (4) Upon completion of the investigation process, the GTR shall 
notify the contractor in writing of any contractor employees' 
ineligibility to work on this contract. The contractor shall immediately 
remove such employees from work on this contract.
    (5) The contractor shall notify the GTR in writing whenever a 
contractor employee for whom a background investigation package was 
required and submitted to HUD terminates employment or otherwise is no 
longer performing work under this contract. The contractor shall provide 
a copy of the written notice to the Contracting Officer.
    (d) Security breach notification. The contractor shall immediately 
notify the GTR and the Contracting Officer of any breach or suspected 
breach of security or any unauthorized disclosure of the information 
contained in the automated system specified in this contract.
    (e) Nondisclosure of information. (1) Neither the contractor nor any 
of its employees shall divulge or release data or information developed 
or obtained during performance of this contract, except to authorized 
Government personnel with an established need to know or upon written 
approval of the Contracting Officer. Information contained in all source 
documents and other media provided by HUD are the sole property of HUD.
    (2) The contractor shall require that any employees who may have 
access to the automated systems identified in paragraph (a) sign a 
pledge of nondisclosure of information. These pledges shall be signed by 
the employees before they are permitted to perform work under this 
contract. The contractor shall maintain the signed pledges for

[[Page 484]]

a period of three years after final payment under this contract.
    (f) Security procedures. The contractor shall establish personnel 
security procedures that meet, as a minimum, the requirements of HUD 
Handbook 2400.24. The contractor shall provide a copy of such procedures 
and any revisions made to them during the period of the contract to the 
GTR.
    (g) Contractor compliance. Failure on the part of the contractor to 
comply with the terms of this clause may result in termination of this 
contract for default.
    (h) Other clearance requirements. When any work performed by 
contractor personnel on-site in a HUD facility meets the criteria set 
forth in HUDAR 2437.110(e), the contractor shall also comply with the 
requirements of the clause at 48 CFR 2452.237-75, Clearance of 
Contractor Personnel.
    (i) Subcontracts. The contractor shall incorporate this clause in 
all subcontracts where the requirements specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section are applicable to performance of the subcontract.

products prior to their delivery to HUD using software tools and 
processes capable of detecting all known viruses.

number, if any]

    ``This product has been scanned for known viruses using [name of 
virus-screening product, including version number, if any] and is 
certified to be free of known viruses at the time of delivery.''

    (c) The Contracting Officer may assess monetary damages against the 
contractor sufficient to compensate HUD for actual or estimated costs 
resulting from computer virus damage or malicious destruction of 
computer information arising from the contractor's failure to take 
adequate precautions to preclude delivery of virus-containing products 
in the delivery of hardware, software, or data on diskettes under this 
contract.
    (d) This clause shall not limit the rights of the government under 
any other clause of this contract.

    (a) Authorities. Citation: 42 U.S.C. 1870(c).
    (b) Application. When an NSF contract is for scientific activities 
which are determined by the NSF contracting officer to be ``necessary to 
carry out the purposes of the NSF Act,'' then 41 U.S.C. 252(c)(15) is 
applicable and the contract may be entered into through negotiation 
rather than formal advertising. The Foundation's contracting officer 
may, in lieu of reliance on 42 U.S.C. 1870(c) and 41 U.S.C. 252(c)(15), 
utilize other applicable negotiating authorities at his or her 
discretion. 42 U.S.C. 1870(c) and 41 U.S.C. 252(c)(15) may also be used 
to authorize negotiation if the Foundation is carrying out, ``at the 
request of the Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense, specific 
scientific activities in connection with matters relating to 
international cooperation or national security.'' Contracts or their 
modifications entered into under this authority may be done so without 
legal consideration and without performance or other bonds.

of the Code of Federal Regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 2527.7002  NSF patent policy.

    As authorized by the National Science Board at its 230th meeting, 
October 15-16, 1981, the Director of the National Science Foundation has 
adopted the following statement of NSF patent policy.
    (a) In accordance with by the Bayh-Dole Act and the Presidential 
Memorandum entitled ``Government Patent Policy'' issued February 18, 
1983, the Foundation will use the Patent Rights clause prescribed by the 
Department of Commerce in all its funding agreements for the performance 
of experimental, developmental, or research work, including awards made 
to foreign entities, unless the Foundation determines that some other 
provision would better serve the purposes of that Act or the interests 
of the United States and the general public.
    (b) In funding agreements covered by a treaty or agreement that 
provides that an international organization or foreign government, 
research institute, or inventor will own or share patent rights, the 
Foundation will acquire such patent rights as are necessary to comply 
with the applicable treaty or agreement.
    (c) If an awardee elects not to retain rights to an invention, the 
Foundation will allow the inventor to retain the principal patent rights 
unless the awardee, or the inventor's employer if other than the 
awardee, shows that it would be harmed by that action.
    (d) The Foundation will normally allow any patent rights not wanted 
by the awardee or inventor to be dedicated to the public through 
publication in scientific journals or as a statutory invention 
registration. However, if another Federal agency is known to be 
interested in the relevant technology, the Foundation may give it an 
opportunity to review and patent the invention so long as that does not 
inhibit the dissemination of the research results to the scientific 
community.

               Subpart 2801.1_Purpose, Authority, Issuance


<R05>
Sec. 2801.101  Purpose.

    (a) The Justice Acquisition Regulations (JAR) in this chapter are 
established to provide procurement regulations that supplement the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 CFR chapter 1. As such, the 
regulations contained in the JAR will include coverage of only those 
areas where agency implementation is required by the FAR, or where 
Department of Justice (DOJ) policies and procedures exist that 
supplement FAR coverage and directly affect the contractual relationship 
between the Department and potential or existing contractors. The JAR 
will not repeat FAR coverage.
    (b) The FAR contains many references to agency procedures. If the 
JAR does not include supplemental guidance under the corresponding part 
or subpart, it is because the FAR language is considered to be 
sufficient. In those instances where the JAR states ``in accordance with 
bureau procedures,'' it does not mean that the bureau must have a 
procedure. It is intended that the bureau procedures are to be followed 
if they exist, however, it does not mean that the bureau must have a 
formal written procedure. Where both the JAR and bureau procedures do 
not address a FAR subject, the FAR guidance is to be followed.
    (c) The JAR is not a complete system of regulations and must be used 
in conjunction with the FAR.


<R05>
Sec. 2801.106  OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act.

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35) and the 
Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) implementing regulations at 5 
CFR part 1320, require that reporting and record keeping requirements 
affecting 10 or more members of the public be cleared by that office. 
The OMB control number for the collection of information under 48 CFR 
chapter 28 is 1103-0018.

                      Subpart 2801.2_Administration


<R05>
Sec. 2801.270-1  Revisions.

    In addition to changes published in the Federal Register, the JAR 
will be amended by issuance of Justice Acquisition Circulars (JACs) 
containing

[[Page 500]]

loose-leaf replacement pages which revise parts, subparts, sections, 
subsections, paragraphs or subparagraphs. A vertical bar (edit bar) at 
the beginning or end of a line indicates that a change has been made 
within that line.

              Subpart 2801.3_Agency Acquisition Regulations


<R05>
Sec. 2801.304  Agency control and compliance procedures.

    Pursuant to FAR 1.304, the Procurement Executive (PE) is responsible 
for ensuring that bureau acquisition regulations and directives do not 
restrain the flexibilities found in the FAR. For this reason, bureau 
acquisition regulations shall be forwarded to the PE upon issuance. The 
PE reserves the right to revoke the regulations and directives in this 
chapter if they are determined to be restrictive.

             Subpart 2801.4_Deviations From the FAR and JAR


<R05>
Sec. 2801.403  Individual deviations.

    Individual deviations from the FAR or the JAR shall be approved by 
the head of the contracting activity (HCA). A copy of the deviation 
shall be included in the contract file. Copies of all deviations will be 
provided to the PE.


<R05>
Sec. 2801.404  Class deviations.

    Requests for class deviations from the FAR or the JAR shall be 
submitted to the PE. The PE will consult with the chairperson of the 
Civilian Agency Acquisition Council, as appropriate, and send his/her 
recommendations to the Assistant Attorney General for Administration 
(AAG/A). The AAG/A will grant or deny requests for such deviations. For 
the purposes of this chapter, requests for deviations involving basic 
ordering agreements, master type contracts, or situations where multiple 
awards are made from one solicitation, are considered to involve more 
than one contract and therefore considered to be class deviation 
requests.


<R05>
Sec. 2801.470  Requests for class deviations.

    Requests for approval of class deviations from the FAR or the JAR 
shall be forwarded to the PE. Such requests will be signed by the Bureau 
Procurement Chief (BPC). Requests for class deviations shall be 
submitted as far in advance as the exigencies of the situation permit 
and shall contain sufficient written justification to evaluate the 
request.

     Subpart 2801.6_Career Development, Contracting Authority, and 
                            Responsibilities


<R05>
Sec. 2801.601  General.

    (a) In accordance with Attorney General Order 1687-93, the authority 
vested in the Attorney General with respect to contractual actions, for 
goods and services, is delegated to the following officials:
    (1) AAG/A (for the offices, boards, and divisions (OBDs);
    (2) Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation;
    (3) Director, Federal Bureau of Prisons;
    (4) Commissioner, Federal Prison Industries;
    (5) Commissioner, Immigration and Naturalization Service;

    (7) Assistant Attorney General, Office of Justice Programs;
    (8) Director, U.S. Marshals Service;
    (9) Inspector General, Office of the Inspector General.
    (b) The acquisition authority delegated to the officials in 
2801.601(a) may be redelegated to subordinate officials as necessary for 
the efficient and proper administration of the Department's acquisition 
operations. Such redelegated authority shall expressly state whether it 
carries the power of redelegation of authority.
    (c) The redelegation of contracting authority directly to specific 
persons without regard for intermediate organizational levels only 
establishes authority to represent the Government in its commercial 
business dealings. It is not intended to affect the organizational 
relationship between the contracting officers and higher administrative 
and supervisory levels in the performance of their duties.

Sec. 2801.603-1  Department of Justice Acquisition Career Management 
          Program.

    (a) Each Bureau Procurement Chief shall develop and manage an 
acquisition career management program for contracting personnel in his 
or her component, consistent and uniform with this section and the 
Department of Justice Acquisition Procurement Career Management Program.
    (b) The program shall cover all contracting personnel in the 
following categories:
    (1) General Schedule (GS-1102) Contracting Series;
    (2) Contracting officers, regardless of General Schedule Series, 
with contracting authority above the simplified acquisition threshold;
    (3) Purchasing Series (GS-1105), other individuals performing 
purchasing duties and individuals with contracting authority between the 
micro purchase and simplified acquisition thresholds.
    (4) All Contracting Officer Representatives/Contracting Officer 
Technical Representatives, or equivalent positions.
    (c) The program shall include:
    (1) Management information system. Standardized information on the 
acquisition workforce will be collected and maintained. To the maximum 
extent practicable, such data requirements shall conform to the 
standards established by the Office of Personnel Management for the 
Central Personnel Data File and shall be compatible with the Department 
of Justice acquisition workforce management information system.
    (2) Individual assessments and development plans for personnel in 
the GS-1102 contracting series. (i) An individual assessment by a 
supervisor of each covered employee's state of competence to perform the 
full range of potential duties of his or her job; and
    (ii) An individual development plan to schedule classroom, on-the-
job training, or other training to develop the employee's skill level to 
an appropriate level in each area of competence necessary to perform his 
or her job.
    (iii) Individual assessments and development plans should be 
designed to fit the needs of the component, but they should be built 
upon the units of competence and instruction prepared by the Federal 
Acquisition Institute whenever feasible. Individual development plans 
should attempt to bring the employee to an appropriate level of skill in 
all necessary competencies in the field of procurement. In general, a 
proficiency skill level of 3, as defined in Attachment 1 to Office of 
Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Policy Letter 92-3, shall be obtained 
for any contracting duty that is actually required to be performed on 
the job. Individual assessments and development plans should be reviewed 
annually and revised as appropriate, until the employee reaches the full 
competency level of his or her job.
    (iv) Employees who perform only purchasing duties, regardless of 
occupational series, shall be required to obtain the requisite level of 
skill only in competencies involving simplified acquisitions. If the 
employee's duties are expanded to include contracting duties, then skill 
in procurement competencies must be assessed and developed.
    (v) Individual assessments of covered employee skills shall be 
completed within 90 days of the employee's entry on duty.
    (3) Mandatory training. Training shall be provided for the 
identified categories of contracting personnel to meet the minimum 
standards identified in OFPP Policy Letter 97-01.
    (4) Skills currency. Contract Specialists (GS-1102) and contracting 
officers with authority to obligate funds above the micro-purchase 
threshold that have

[[Page 502]]

satisfied the mandatory training requirements, shall be provided the 
equivalent of at least 40 hours of continuing procurement and 
acquisition related education and training every two years for the 
purpose of maintaining the currency of acquisition knowledge and skills.
    (5) Program funding. Bureau Procurement Chiefs are responsible for 
assessing the funding needs to provide for the education and training of 
their acquisition workforce and requesting such funding in the annual 
budget process.


<R05>
Sec. 2801.603-3  Appointment.

    Contracting officers whose authority will be limited to micro-
purchases shall be appointed in writing and include any limitations to 
that authority.

    (2) Obligate, in any manner, the payment of money by the Government;

without the requisite training and signed COTR certificate for the file. 
In the rare event that there is an urgent requirement for a specific

completed the required training, the BPC may waive the training 
requirements and authorize the individual to perform the COTR duties, 
for a period of time not to exceed 120 days. The waiver will be granted 
in accordance with bureau procedures.

                    Subpart 2807.1_Acquisition Plans


<R05>
Sec. 2807.102  Policy.

    (a)(1) In accordance with FAR 7.1, DOJ contracting activities shall 
perform acquisition planning and conduct market research for all 
acquisitions in order to promote and provide for:
    (i) Full and open competition (see FAR part 6);
    (ii) Maximum practicable competition for those acquisitions where 
full and open competition is not required by FAR part 6; and
    (iii) The acquisition of commercial items or, when commercial items 
are not available, nondevelopmental items to the maximum extent 
practicable.
    (2) The degree of planning and market research may vary, depending 
on such factors as the acquisition's size, scope and complexity.

[[Page 511]]

    (b) Acquisition planning shall be the joint responsibility of both 
the contracting and program offices. All acquisition plans shall be 
prepared sufficiently in advance of solicitation release dates to ensure 
that requirements are presented in a way that promotes full and open 
competition and provides sufficient time for the identification and 
resolution of impediments that could delay the acquisition or lead to 
increased cost or technical risk.


<R05>
Sec. 2807.102-70  Applicability.

    (a) Planning commensurate with the complexity and dollar value of 
the individual requirement shall be performed for all acquisitions, 
except for those acquisitions listed in paragraph (c) of this subsection 
which may be exempt from the planning process. Heads of contracting 
activities may authorize the use of oral plans for simple and/or small 
dollar acquisitions. When oral plans are used, the file should be 
documented with the name of the individual who approved the plan.
    (b) Written acquisition plans shall be prepared for all major 
systems acquisitions as defined in 2834.002.
    (c) The following types of acquisitions may be exempt from the 
acquisition planning program;
    (1) Architect-engineering services;
    (2) Unsolicited proposals (when deemed innovative and unique in 
accordance with FAR 15.5);
    (3) Regulated utility services where services are available from 
only one source;
    (4) Acquisitions made from or through other Government agencies; and
    (5) Contract modifications which exercise an option or add funds to 
an incrementally funded contract (provided there is an approved 
acquisition planning document for the original action and there is no 
significant deviation from that plan).


<R05>
Sec. 2807.103  Agency-head responsibilities.

    The AAG/A may establish acquisition planning criteria and thresholds 
for those bureaus who:
    (a) Fail to allow ample time for conducting competitive 
acquisitions;
    (b) Develop a pattern of awarding urgent requirements that generally 
restrict competition;
    (c) Fail to identify identical or like requirements that, where 
appropriate, can be combined under one solicitation and miss 
opportunities to obtain lower costs through volume purchasing, reduce 
administrative costs in processing one contract action versus multiple 
actions, and standardize goods and services.


<R05>
Sec. 2807.103-70  Other officials' responsibilities.

    (a) In accordance with FAR 7.1, the HCA shall develop an acquisition 
planning program for all acquisitions to ensure that its needs are met 
in the most effective, economical, the timely manner.
    (b) Heads of contracting activities have the flexibility to develop 
programs that are best suited to their individual needs. Criteria and 
thresholds shall be established at which increasingly greater detail and 
formality in the planning process is required. DOJ components are 
encouraged to keep paperwork to a minimum and to put a premium on 
simplicity.
    (c) HCAs shall ensure that, during the acquisition planning phase, 
requirements personnel consider the use of:
    (1) The metric system of measurement consistent with 15 U.S.C. 
2205(b); and
    (2) Environmentally preferable and energy-efficient products and 
services.


<R05>
Sec. 2807.105  Contents of written acquisition plans.

    (a) HCAs shall prescribe format and content of acquisition planning 
documents that are commensurate with the complexity and dollar value of 
the individual acquisition (sample acquisition planning documents for 
both simple and complex acquisitions will be make available by PPRG, 
JMD, and may be used or modified as appropriate).
    (b) HCAs shall include, at a minimum, the content elements at FAR 
7.105 and 7.106 for all major systems acquisitions as defined in 
2834.002.

concurrent with the transmittal of the statement of work (or 
modification thereof), a written determination that none of the 
functions to be performed are inherently governmental. Any disputes 
concerning this determination shall be resolved by the contracting 
officer, after consultation with the requirements official. The

<R05>
Sec. 2809.402  Policy.

    Contracting activities shall:
    (a) Consider debarment or suspension of a contractor when cause is 
shown as listed under FAR 9.406-2 and FAR 9.407-2. Contracting staffs 
should consult with their appropriate legal counsel prior to making a 
decision to initiate debarment or suspension proceedings. If a 
determination is made that available facts do not justify beginning 
debarment or suspension proceedings, the file should be documented 
accordingly. This determination should be subject to reconsideration if 
new information or additional fact-finding so justifies.
    (b) If the decision is made to initiate debarment and/or suspension 
of a contractor, immediately prepare a notice in accordance with FAR 
9.406-3(c) of FAR 9.407-3(c). The draft notice, along with the 
administrative file containing all relevant facts and analysis shall be 
forwarded to the PE, as the debarring and suspending official, following 
review by the activity's legal counsel and BPC.
    (c) The PE shall:
    (1) Review the notice and administrative file for sufficiency and 
provide for review by other DOJ officials as considered appropriate;
    (2) If it is determined that action is warranted, give the 
contractor prompt notice of the proposed debarment or suspension, in 
accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) or FAR 9.407-3(c);
    (3) Direct additional fact-finding as necessary when material facts 
are in dispute.
    (4) Notify the contractor of the final decision to debar or suspend, 
including a decision not to debar or suspend, in accordance with FAR 
9.406-3(c) and FAR 9.407-3(c).


<R05>
Sec. 2809.404  List of parties excluded from Federal procurement and 
          nonprocurement programs.

    (a) The PE shall:
    (1) Provide GSA notification of the information set forth in FAR 
9.404(b)

[[Page 513]]

within five working days after debarring or suspending a contractor or 
modifying or rescinding such an action.
    (2) Maintain agency-wide records of debarred or suspended 
contractors in accordance with FAR 9.404.
    (b) Contracting activities shall provide an effective system to 
ensure that contracting staff consult the ``List of Parties Excluded 
from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs'' prior to 
soliciting offers from, awarding or extending contracts to, or 
consenting to subcontracts with contractors on the list.


<R05>
Sec. 2809.405  Effect of listing.

    (a) Contractors debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment are 
excluded from receiving contracts, and bureaus shall not solicit offers 
from, award contracts to, or consent to subcontracts with these 
contractors, unless the HCA determines that there is a compelling reason 
for such action and the PE approves such determinations.
    (b) Bids received from any listed contractor in response to an 
invitation for bids shall be entered on the abstract of bids, and 
rejected unless the HCA determines in writing that there is a compelling 
reason to consider the bid and the PE approves such action.
    (c) Proposals, quotations, or offers received from any listed 
contractor shall not be evaluated for award or included in the 
competitive range, nor shall discussions be conducted with a listed 
offeror during a period of ineligibility, unless the HCA determines in 
writing that there is a compelling reason to do so and the PE approves 
such action.


<R05>
Sec. 2809.405-1  Continuation of current contracts.

    (a) In accordance with FAR 9.405-1, contracting activities may 
continue contracts or subcontracts in existence at the time a contractor 
is suspended or debarred unless it is determined that termination of the 
contract is in the best interest of the Government. In making this 
determination, contracting activities shall consider the seriousness of 
the act or omission leading to the debarment or suspension, the effect 
of debarment or suspension on the contractor's ability to continue 
operations, and the Department's ability to safeguard its interests and 
receive satisfactory performance.
    (b) Contracting activities shall not renew or otherwise extend the 
duration of current contracts, or consent to subcontracts, with 
contractors debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment, unless the 
HCA states, in writing, the compelling reasons for renewal or extension 
and the PE approves such action.

   Subpart 2809.5_Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest


<R05>
Sec. 2809.503  Waiver.

    The HCA may waive any general rule or procedure of FAR 9.5 by 
determining that its application in a particular situation would not be 
in the Government's interest.

Sec. 2811.001  Definitions.

    Dual systems means the use of both inch-pound and metric systems. 
For example, an item is designed, produced and described in inch-pound 
values with soft metric values also shown for information or comparison 
purposes.
    Hybrid systems means the use of both inch-pound and standard metric 
values in specifications, standards, supplies, and services; e.g., an 
engine with internal parts in metric dimensions and external fittings or 
attachments in inch-pound dimensions.

[[Page 514]]

    Metric system means the International System of Units established by 
the General Conference of Weights and Measures in 1960.
    Soft metric means the result of mathematical conversion of inch-
pound measurements to metric equivalents in specifications, standards, 
supplies, and services. The physical dimensions are not changed.


<R05>
Sec. 2811.002  Policy.

    Consistent with the policy expressed in FAR 11.002(b), solicitations 
must include specifications and purchase descriptions stated in metric 
units of measurement whenever metric is the accepted industry system. 
Whenever possible, commercially developed metric specifications and 
internationally, or domestically developed voluntary standards, using 
metric measurements, must be adopted. While an industry is in transition 
to metric specifications, solicitations must include requirements 
documents stated in soft metric, hybrid, or dual systems, except when 
impractical or inefficient.

<R05>
Sec. 2813.7001  Policy.

    Under limited circumstances as described in this subpart, supplies 
or services directly related to mission accomplishment, may be acquired 
on the open market from local suppliers at the site of the work or use 
point, using vendor's invoices under the certified invoice procedure, 
instead of issuing purchase orders. Certified invoice procedures may not 
be used to place orders under established contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 2813.7002  Procedure.

    (a) Purchases utilizing the certified invoice procedure shall be 
effected only in accordance with FAR part 13 and this part 2813, subject 
to the following:
    (1) The amount of any one purchase does not exceed the micro-
purchase threshold;
    (2) A purchase order is not required by either the supplier or the 
Government;
    (3) Appropriate invoices can be obtained from the supplier; and,
    (4) The items to be purchased shall be domestic source end products, 
except as provided in FAR subpart 25.1.
    (b) Use of the certified invoice procedures does not eliminate the 
requirements in FAR part 13 or this part 2813 that are applicable to 
purchases of this dollar threshold.
    (c) The chief of the contracting office, as defined in 2802.101(c), 
shall delegate the authority to use the certified invoice procedure. 
Each delegation must specify any limitations placed on the individual's 
use of these procedures, such as limits on the amount of each purchase, 
or limits on the commodities, or services which can be procured.
    (d) Each individual using this purchasing technique shall require 
the supplier to immediately submit properly prepared invoices which 
itemize property or services furnished. Upon receiving the invoice, the 
individual making the purchase shall annotate the invoice with the date 
of receipt,

[[Page 517]]

verify the arithmetic accuracy of the invoiced amount and verify on the 
invoice that the supplies and/or services have been received and 
accepted. If the invoice is correct, the individual making the purchase 
shall sign the invoice indicating acceptance and immediately forward it 
to the appropriate administrative office. The invoice shall be approved 
by the appropriate administrative office and forwarded to the Finance 
Office for payment within 5 workdays after receipt of the invoice, or 
acceptance of supplies or services, whichever is later. Before 
forwarding the invoice to Finance, the administrative office shall place 
the following statement on the invoice, along with the accounting and 
appropriation data:

    I certify that these goods and/or services were received on --------
-------- (date) an accepted on ---------------- (date). Oral purchase 
was authorized and no confirming order has been issued.

approval, oral approval must be obtained; however, written documentation 
to support the award and confirm the oral approval must be submitted as 
soon as practicable after award.

              Subpart 2823.4_Use of the Recovered Materials


<R05>
Sec. 2823.403  Policy.

    It is the policy of DOJ that its contracting activities and 
contractors that procure on behalf of DOJ, acquire EPA designated items 
in accordance with EPA's Comprehensive Procurement Guideline For 
Products Containing Recovered Materials (CPG) (40 CFR part 247). The 
recommended minimum recovered materials content of EPA designated items 
is set forth in EPA's Recovered Materials Advisory Notices (RMANs) and 
in E.O. 12873 as amended. These publications are available from the 
DOJEE.


<R05>
Sec. 2823.404  Procedures.

    (a) The program office initiating the acquisition is responsible for 
determining if recovered materials should be included in the 
specification. Procurement offices are responsible for informing program 
offices of the requirement for writing specifications for designated 
items that include minimum content standards specified in the RMANs.
    (b) If the program office chooses to procure designated items 
containing less than the minimum content standards, and program office 
must justify that decision in writing and include a copy of the signed 
justification with the procurement request package. FAR 23.404(b)(3) 
sets forth the only acceptable justifications for acquiring EPA 
designated items which do not meet the minimum content standard. The 
contracting officer is the approving official for justifications made 
pursuant to FAR 23.404(b)(3). Contracting officers are responsible for 
including a signed copy of the justification in the acquisition file and 
submitting a copy of the approved justification to the DOJEE.


<R05>
Sec. 2823.404-70  Affirmative procurement program for recycled 
          materials.

    (a) Recovered materials preference program. Preference will be given 
to procuring and using products containing recovered materials rather 
than products made with virgin materials when adequate competition 
exists, and when price, performance and availability are equal.
    (b) Promotion program. The DOJEE has primary responsibility for 
actively promoting the acquisition of products containing recycled 
materials throughout DOJ. Technical and procurement personnel will 
cooperate with the DOJEE to actively promote DOJ's Affirmative 
Procurement Program (APP).
    (c) Procedures for vendor estimation, verification and 
certification.
    (1) Estimation. The contractor shall provide estimates of the total 
percentage(s) of recovered materials for EPA designated items to be used 
in products or services provided.
    (2) Certification. Contracting officers shall provide copies of all 
vendor and subcontractor certifications required by FAR 23.405(b) to the 
DOJEE.
    (3) Vertification. The DOJEE is responsible for periodically 
reviewing vendor certification documents and waivers as part of the 
annual review and monitoring process to determine if DOJ is in 
compliance with E.O. 12873 and subsequent amendments.

                  Subpart 2829.3_State and Local Taxes


<R05>
Sec. 2829.303  Application of State and local taxes to Government 
          contractors and subcontractors.

    (a) It is DOJ policy that DOJ contracts shall not contain clauses 
expressly designating prime contractors as agents of the Government for 
the purpose of avoiding State and local taxes.
    (b) Although circumstances may exist under which a contractor is an 
agent of the Government, even in the absence of a contract clause 
expressly designating a contractor as such, these circumstances should 
be extremely rare. Before any DOJ contracting activity may contend that 
any of its contractors are agents of the Government for the purpose of 
claiming immunity from State and local sales and use taxes, the matter 
will be referred to the AAG/A for review, and approval to ensure that 
DOJ policy is complied with and that the contracting activity's 
contention is fully in accordance with the pertinent legal principles 
and precedents. Each case forwarded will be reviewed by the HCA before 
referral to the AAG/A. The referral will include all pertinent data on 
which the contracting activity's contention is based, together with a 
thorough analysis of all relevant legal precedents.
    (c) Whenever clauses, procedures, and business practices are cited 
by DOJ

[[Page 526]]

contracting activities to support the contention that a contractor is an 
agent of the Government for the purpose of immunity from a State or 
local sales or use tax, contracting activities should whenever possible, 
devise alternative clauses, procedures, and practices for future use 
which will accomplish their intended purpose without providing the basis 
for contention that the contractor is an agent of the Government for the 
purpose of immunity from State and local sales or use taxes. Any 
referral to the AAG/A for approval under this subpart shall include 
comments on the extent to which alternative clauses, procedures, or 
practices may be utilized to accomplish the intended purpose without 
providing the basis for the contention that the contractor is an agent 
of the Government for the purpose of immunity from State and local sales 
or use taxes.

authorized to agree to a treatment of costs which would be inconsistent 
with FAR part 31.
    (b) Prior to negotiating an advance agreement, contracting officers 
shall make a written determination setting forth the reasons and 
rationale for entering into such agreements. In addition, the 
determination will set forth the nature, the duration, and which 
contract or contracts are covered by the proposed agreement. All 
determinations required by this subpart will be reviewed and approved at 
a level above the contracting officer prior to negotiation of the 
proposed agreement. The approved determination will be placed in the

the nature, duration, and contract or contracts covered by the 
agreements. Advance agreements will be signed by both the contractor and 
the contracting officer, and made a part of the contract file. Copies of 
executed advance agreements will be distributed to the cognizant audit 
office when applicable.

acquisition threshold may contain a precontract cost authorization 
providing the authorization is for a period of 60 days or less and the 
dollar amount does not exceed the lesser of the simplified acquisition 
threshold or one third of the total estimated costs (including fee if 
any) of the contract.
    (2) the limitation expressed under paragraph (b) of this section may 
be increased in unusual circumstances as appropriate, with the written 
approval of the HCA, but in no event shall they exceed one-third of the 
total estimated costs (including fee if any) of the contract or be for 
periods of time which exceed 90 days.

<R05>
Sec. 2833.101  Definitions.

    (a) Agency Protest Official means the official, other than the 
contracting officer, designated to review and decide procurement 
protests filed with a contracting activity of the Department of Justice.
    (1) This person will be at a level above that of the Contracting 
Officer, will be knowledgeable about the acquisition process in general 
and will have no programmatic interest in the procurement.
    (2) This official shall be an individual designated by the head of 
the contracting activity and may be the Competition Advocate.
    (b) Deciding Official means the person chosen by the protestor to 
decide the agency protest; it may be either the Contracting Officer or 
the Agency Protest Official.
    (c) Interested Party means an actual or prospective offeror whose 
direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or 
by the failure to award a contract.


<R05>
Sec. 2833.102  General.

    (a) This part describes policies and procedures for processing 
protests to the Department of Justice in accordance with Executive Order 
12979, Agency Procurement Protests, dated October 25, 1995, and FAR 
33.103. They are intended to be flexible and to provide for fair, quick, 
and inexpensive resolution of agency protests.
    (b) Interested parties have the option of protesting to the 
Contracting Officer or to the Agency Protest Official.
    (c) Contracting officers and potential protestors are encouraged to 
use their best efforts to resolve concerns through frank and open 
discussion, as required by FAR 33.103(b). In resolving concerns and/or 
protests, consideration should be given to the use of alternative 
dispute resolution techniques where appropriate.
    (d) Responsibilities:

[[Page 529]]

    (1) Contracting Officers: (i) Include the provision at 2852.233-70 
in all solicitations that are expected to exceed the simplified 
acquisition threshold.
    (ii) If the protestor requests that the Contracting Officer decide 
the protest, or if the protest is silent on this issue, the Contracting 
Officer decides the protest using the procedures in this subpart and FAR 
33.103.
    (iii) If the protestor requests that the Agency Protest Official 
decide the protest, the Contracting Officer must ensure that the Agency 
Protest Official receives a copy of the materials served on the 
Contracting Officer within one business day after the filing date.
    (2) Agency Protest Official: If the protestor requests that the 
Agency Protest Official decide the protest, the Official must use the 
procedures in this subpart and FAR 33.103 to provide an independent 
review of the issues raised in the protest.


<R05>
Sec. 2833.103  Protests to the agency.

    (a) The filing time frames in FAR 33.103(e) apply. An agency protest 
is filed when the protest complaint is received at the location the 
solicitation designates for serving protests.
    (b) An interested party filing an agency protest has the choice of 
requesting either that the Contracting Officer or the Agency Protest 
Official decide the protest.
    (c) In addition to the information required by FAR 33.103(d)(2), the 
protest must:
    (1) Indicate that it is a protest to the agency.
    (2) Be filed with the Contracting Officer.
    (3) State whether the protestor chooses to have the Contracting 
Officer or the Agency Protest Official decide the protest. If the 
protest is silent on this matter, the Contracting Officer will decide 
the protest.
    (4) Indicate whether the protestor prefers to make an oral or 
written presentation of arguments in support of the protest to the 
deciding official.
    (d) The decision by the Agency Protest Official is an alternative to 
a decision by the Contracting Officer on a protest. The Agency Protest 
Official will not consider appeals from a Contracting Officer's decision 
on an agency protest.
    (e) The deciding official must conduct a scheduling conference with 
the protestor within five (5) days after the protest is filed. The 
scheduling conference will establish deadlines for oral or written 
arguments in support of the agency protest and for agency officials to 
present information in response to the protest issues. The deciding 
official may hear oral arguments in support of the agency protest at the 
same time as the scheduling conference, depending on availability of the 
necessary parties.
    (f) Oral conferences may take place either by telephone or in 
person. Other parties may attend at the discretion of the deciding 
official.
    (g) The protestor has only one opportunity to support or explain the 
substance of its protest. Department of Justice procedures do not 
provide for any discovery. The deciding official has discretion to 
request additional information from either the agency or the protestor. 
However, the deciding official will normally decide protests on the 
basis of information provided by the protestor and the agency.
    (h) The preferred practice is to resolve protests through informal 
oral discussion.
    (i) An interested party may represent itself or be represented by 
legal counsel. The Department of Justice will not reimburse the 
protester for any legal fees related to the agency protest.
    (j) If an agency protest is received before contract award, the 
Contracting Officer must not make award unless the Head of the 
Contracting Activity makes a determination to proceed under FAR 
33.103(f)(1). Similarly, if an agency protest is filed within ten (10) 
days after award, the Contracting Officer must stay performance unless 
the Head of the Contracting Activity makes a determination to proceed 
under FAR 33.103(f)(3). Any stay of award or suspension of performance 
remains in effect until the protest is decided, dismissed, or withdrawn.
    (k) The deciding official must make a best effort to issue a 
decision on the protest within twenty (20) days after the filing date. 
The decision may be

[[Page 530]]

oral or written. If oral, the deciding official must send a confirming 
letter within three (3) days after the decision using a means that 
provides receipt. The confirming letter must include the following 
information:
    (1) State whether the protest was denied, sustained or dismissed.
    (2) Indicate the date the decision was provided.
    (l) If the deciding official sustains the protest, relief may 
consist of any of the following:
    (1) Recommendation that the contract be terminated for convenience 
or cause.
    (2) Recompeting the requirement.
    (3) Amending the solicitation.
    (4) Refraining from exercising contract options.
    (5) Awarding a contract consistent with statute, regulation, and the 
terms of the solicitation.
    (6) Other action that the deciding official determines is 
appropriate.
    (m) If the Agency Protest Official sustains a protest, then within 
30 days after receiving the Official's recommendations for relief, the 
Contracting Officer must either:
    (1) Fully implement the recommended relief; or
    (2) Notify the Agency Protest Official in writing of any 
recommendations have not been implemented and explain why.
    (n) Proceedings on an agency protest may be dismissed or stayed if a 
protest on the same or similar basis is filed with a protest forum 
outside of the Department of Justice.

<R05>
Sec. 2834.002  Policy.

    In accordance with Pub. L. 98-577, the Small Business and Federal 
Procurement Competition Enhancement Act of 1984, an executive agency may 
establish a dollar threshold for the designation of a major system. 
Accordingly, dollar thresholds for a major system under Office of 
Management and Budget Circular A-109 are designated in this section.
    (a) Major automated information system. Within the Department of 
Justice, a major automated information system is one whose life-cycle 
cost is in excess of $100 million.
    (b) Major real property system. (1) By purchase, when the assessed 
value of the property exceeds $60 million.
    (2) By lease, when the annual rental charges, including basic 
services (e.g., cleaning, guards, maintenance), exceed $1.8 million.
    (3) By transfer from another agency at no cost when the assessed 
value of the property exceeds $12 million.
    (c) Research and Development (R&D) System. Any R&D activity expected 
to exceed $0.5 million, for the R&D phase is subject to OMB Circular A-
109, unless exempted by the HCA.
    (d) Any other system or activity. The HCA responsible for the system 
may designate any system or activity as a Major System under OMB 
Circular A-109 as a result of Departmental review, e.g., selected 
systems designed to support more than one principal organizational unit.
    (e) Exemption. The AAG/A, upon recommendation by the HCA responsible 
for the system, may determine that because of the routine nature of the 
acquisition, the system (e.g., an information system utilizing only off-
the-shelf hardware or software) will be exempt from the OMB Circular A-
109 process, although by virtue of the life cycle costs, it would 
otherwise be identified as ``major'' in response to OMB Circular A-109.

include the terms ``proposal'' and ``offerors''. The terms ``invitation 
for bids'' and ``invitational'', as used in their clause include the

    (b) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been 
identified in the schedule by a ``brand name or equal'' description, 
such identification is intended to be descriptive but not restrictive, 
and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will 
be satisfactory. Bids offering ``equal'' products (including products of 
a brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) 
will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in 
the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient 
characteristics and requirements listed in the invitation.
    (c) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in his/her bid that he/she 
is offering an ``equal'' product, his/her bid shall be considered as 
offering the brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.
    (d)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an ``equal'' product, the 
branch name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in 
the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be 
otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the 
determinations to equality of the product offered shall be the 
responsibility of the Government and will be based on information 
furnished by the bidder or

[[Page 535]]

identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably 
available to the purchasing activity. To ensure the sufficient 
information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her 
bid all description material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings, or 
other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to: (i) 
determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics 
requirements of the invitation for bids, and (ii) established exactly 
what the bidder proposed to furnish and what the Government would be 
binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished 
may include specific references to information previously furnished or 
information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.
    (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it 
conform to the requirements of the invitation for bids, he/she shall: 
(i) include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed 
modification, and (ii) clearly mark any description material to show the 
proposed modifications.
    (3) Modifications proposed after the bid opening to make a product 
conform to a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids 
will not be considered.

Sec. 2852.223-70  Unsafe conditions due to the presence of hazardous 
          material.

    As prescribed in 2823.303-70, insert the following clause:

 Unsafe Conditions Due to the Presence of Hazardous Material (JUN 1996)

    (a) ``Unsafe condition'' as used in this clause means the actual or 
potential exposure of contractor or Government employees to a hazardous 
material as defined in Federal Standard No. 313, and any revisions 
thereto during the term of this contract, or any other material or 
working condition designated by the Contracting Officer's Technical 
Representative (COTR) as potentially hazardous and requiring safety 
controls.
    (b) The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is 
responsible for issuing and administering regulations that require 
contractors to appraise its employees of all hazards to which they may 
be exposed in the course of their employment; proper conditions and 
precautions for safe use and exposure; and related symptoms and 
emergency treatment in the event of exposure.
    (c) Prior to commencement of work, contractors are required to 
inspect for and report to the contracting officer or designee the 
presence of, or suspected presence of, any unsafe condition including 
asbestos or other hazardous materials or working conditions in areas in 
which they will be working.
    (d) If during the performance of the work under this contract, the 
contractor or any of its employees, or subcontractor employees, 
discovers the existence of an unsafe condition, the contractor shall 
immediately notify the contracting officer, or designee, (with written 
notice provided not later than three (3) working days thereafter) of the 
existence of an unsafe condition. Such notice shall include the 
contractor's recommendations for the protection and the safety of 
Government, contractor and subcontractor personnel and property that may 
be exposed to the unsafe condition.
    (e) When the Government receives notice of an unsafe condition from 
the contractor, the parties will agree on a course of action to mitigate 
the effects of that condition and, if necessary, the contract will be 
amended. Failure to agree on a course of action will constitute a 
dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.
    (f) Notice contained in this clause shall relieve the contractor or 
subcontractors from complying with applicable Federal, State, and local 
laws, codes, ordinances and regulations (including the obtaining of 
licenses and permits) in connection with hazardous material including 
but not limited to the use, disturbance, or disposal of such material.

                             (End of clause)


<R05>
Sec. 2852.233-70  Protests filed directly with the Department of 
          Justice.

    As prescribed in 2833.102(d), insert a clause substantially as 
follows:

    Protests Filed Directly With the Department of Justice (JAN 1998)

    (a) The following definitions apply in this provision:
    (1) ``Agency Protest Official'' means the official, other than the 
contracting officer, designated to review and decide procurement 
protests filed with a contracting activity of the Department of Justice.
    (2) ``Deciding Official'' means the person chosen by the protestor 
to decide the agency protest; it may be either the Contracting Officer 
or the Agency Protest Official.
    (3) ``Interested Party'' means an actual or prospective offeror 
whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a 
contract or by the failure to award a contract.
    (b) A protest filed directly with the Department of Justice must:
    (1) Indicate that it is a protest to the agency.
    (2) Be filed with the Contracting Officer.
    (3) State whether the protestor chooses to have the Contracting 
Officer or the Agency Protest Official decide the protest. If the 
protestor is silent on this matter, the Contracting Officer will decide 
the protest.

[[Page 536]]

    (4) Indicate whether the protestor prefers to make an oral or 
written presentation of arguments in support of the protest to the 
deciding official.
    (5) Include the information required by FAR 33.103(a)(2):
    (i) Name, address, facsimile number and telephone number of the 
protestor.
    (ii) Solicitation or contract number.
    (iii) Detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds for the 
protest, to include a description of resulting prejudice to the 
protestor.
    (iv) Copies of relevant documents.
    (v) Request for a ruling by the agency.
    (vi) Statement as to the form of relief requested.
    (vii) All information establishing that the protestor is an 
interested party for the purpose of filing a protest.
    (viii) All information establishing the timeliness of this protest.
    (c) An interested party filing a protest with the Department of 
Justice has the choice of requesting either that the Contracting Officer 
or the Agency Protest Official decide the protest.
    (d) The decision by the Agency Protest Official is an alternative to 
a decision by the Contracting Officer. The Agency Protest Official will 
not consider appeals from the Contracting Officer's decision on an 
agency protest.
    (e) The deciding official must conduct a scheduling conference with 
the protestor within five (5) days after the protest is filed. The 
scheduling conference will establish deadlines for oral or written 
arguments in support of the agency protest and for many officials to 
present information in response to the protest issues. The deciding 
official may hear oral arguments in support of the agency protest at the 
same time as the scheduling conference, depending on availability of the 
necessary parties.
    (f) Oral conferences may take place either by telephone or in 
person. Other parties may attend at the discretion of the deciding 
official.
    (g) The protestor has only one opportunity to support or explain the 
substance of its protest. Department of Justice procedures do not 
provide for any discovery. The deciding official may request additional 
information from either the agency or the protestor. The deciding 
official will resolve the protest through informal presentations or 
meetings to the maximum extent practicable.
    (h) An interested party may rerpresent itself or be represented by 
legal counsel. The Department of Justice will not reimburse the 
protester for any legal fees related to the agency protest.
    (i) The Department of Justice will stay award or suspend contract 
Performance in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). The stay or suspension 
unless over-ridden, remains in effect until the protest is decided, 
dismissed, or withdrawn.
    (j) The deciding official will make a best effort to issue a 
decision on the protest within twenty (20) days after the filing date. 
The decision may be oral or written.
    (k) The Department of Justice may dismiss or stay proceeding on an 
agency protest if a protest on the same or similar basis is filed with a 
protest forum outside the Department of Justice.

                             (End of clause)
