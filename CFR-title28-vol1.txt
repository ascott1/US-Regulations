                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2007), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

             United States Attorneys in Civil Division Cases

                          [Directive No. 14-95]

    By virtue of the authority vested in me by part 0 of title 28 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations, particularly Sec. Sec. 0.45, 0.160, 0.164, 
and 0.168, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Section 1. Authority To Compromise or Close Cases and To File Suits and 
                                 Claims

    (a) Delegation to Deputy Assistant Attorneys General. The Deputy 
Assistant Attorneys General are authorized to act for, and to exercise 
the authority of, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil 
Division with respect to the institution of suits, the acceptance or 
rejection of compromise offers, and the closing of claims or cases, 
unless any such authority is required by law to be exercised by the 
Assistant Attorney General personally or has been specifically delegated 
to another Department official.
    (b) Delegation to United States Attorneys, Branch, Office and Staff 
Directors and Attorneys-in-Charge of Field Offices. Subject to the 
limitations imposed by 28 CFR 0.160(c), and 0.164(a) and section 4(c) of 
this directive, and the authority of the Solicitor General set forth in 
28 CFR 0.163,
    (1) Branch, Office, and Staff Directors, and Attorneys-in-Charge of 
Field Offices with respect to matters assigned or delegated to their 
respective components are hereby delegated the authority to:
    (a) Accept offers in compromise of claims on behalf of the United 
States;
    (i) In all cases in which the gross amount of the original claim did 
not exceed $500,000; and,
    (ii) In all cases in which the gross amount of the original claim 
was between $500,000 and $5,000,000, so long as the difference between 
the gross amount of the original claim and the proposed settlement does 
not exceed $500,000 or 15 percent of the original claim, whichever is 
greater;
    (b) Accept offers in compromise of, or settle administratively, 
claims against the United States in all cases where the principal amount 
of the proposed settlement does not exceed $500,000; and,
    (c) Reject any offers.
    (2) United States Attorneys with respect to matters assigned or 
delegated to their respective components are hereby delegated the 
authority to:

exceed $1,000,000;
    (b) Accept offers in compromise of, or settle administratively, 
claims against the United States in all cases where the principal amount 
of the proposed settlement does not exceed $1,000,000 and,

    (3) With respect to claims asserted in bankruptcy proceedings, the 
term gross amount of the original claim in (1) (a) and (b), and (2) (a) 
and (b) above means liquidation value. Liquidation value is the forced 
sale value of the collateral, if any, securing the claim(s) plus the 
dividend likely to be paid for the unsecured portion of the claim(s) in 
an actual or hypothetical liquidation of the bankruptcy estate.
    (c) Subject to the limitations imposed by sections 1(e) and 4(c) of 
this directive, United States Attorneys, Directors, and Attorneys-in-
Charge are authorized to file suits, counterclaims, and cross-claims, to 
close, or to take any other action necessary to protect the interests of 
the United States in all routine nonmonetary cases, in all routine loan 
collection and foreclosure cases, and in other monetary claims or cases 
where the gross amount of the original claim does not exceed $500,000,

nonmonetary cases which are other than routine will be submitted for the 
approval of the Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division.

conferred compromise and suit authority to Assistant United States 
Attorneys who supervise other Assistant United States Attorneys who 
handle civil litigation.

file suits, counter-claims, and cross-claims, to close cases, or take 
any other action necessary to protect the interests of the United 
States, delegated

[[Page 85]]

by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, may not be exercised, and the 
matter shall be submitted for resolution to the Assistant Attorney 
General, Civil Division, when:
    (1) For any reason, the proposed action, as a practical matter, will 
control or adversely influence the disposition of other claims totaling 
more than the respective amounts designated in the above paragraphs.
    (2) Because a novel question of law or a question of policy is 
presented, or for any other reason, the proposed action should, in the 
opinion of the officer or employee concerned, receive the personal 
attention of the Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division.
    (3) The agency or agencies involved are opposed to the proposed 
action. The views of an agency must be solicited with respect to any 
significant proposed action if it is a party, if it has asked to be 
consulted with respect to any such proposed action, or if such proposed 
action in a case would adversely affect any of its policies.
    (4) The U.S. Attorney involved is opposed to the proposed action and 
requests that the matter be submitted to the Assistant Attorney General 
for decision.
    (5) The case is on appeal, except as determined by the Director of 
the Appellate Staff.

Attorney accepts a compromise, closes a claim or files a suit or claim 
pursuant to the authority delegated by this Directive, a memorandum 
fully explaining the basis for the action taken shall be executed and 
placed in the file. In the case of matters compromised, closed, or filed 
by United States Attorneys, a copy of the memorandum must be sent to the 
appropriate Branch or Office of the Civil Division.
    (b) The compromising of cases or closing of claims or the filing of 
suits for claims, which a United States Attorney is not authorized to 
approve, shall be referred to the appropriate Branch or Office within 
the Civil Division, for decision by the Assistant Attorney General or 
the appropriate authorized person within the Civil Division. The 
referral memorandum should contain a detailed description of the matter, 
the United States Attorney's recommendation, the agency's recommendation 
where applicable, and a full statement of the reasons therefor.

          Section 3. Return of Civil Judgment Cases to Agencies

    Claims arising out of judgments in favor of the United States which 
cannot be permanently closed as uncollectable may be returned to the 
referring Federal agency for servicing and surveillance whenever all 
conditions set forth in USAM 4-2.230 have been met.

                Division Cases to United States Attorneys

    (a) Direct reference to United States Attorneys by agencies. The 
following civil actions under the jurisdiction of the Assistant Attorney

Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division, attention Director, 
Appellate Staff. Consult title 2 of the United States Attorney's Manual 
for procedures and time limitations. An appeal cannot be taken without 
approval of the Solicitor General. Until the Solicitor General has made 
a decision whether an appeal will be taken, the Government attorney 
handling the case must take all necessary procedural actions to preserve 
the Government's right to take an appeal, including filing a protective 
notice of appeal when the time to file a notice of appeal is about to 
expire and the Solicitor General has not yet made a decision. Nothing in 
the foregoing directive affects this obligation.

                         Section 6. Supersession

    This directive supersedes Civil Division Directive No. 176-91 
regarding redelegation of the Assistant Attorney General's authority in 
Civil Division cases to Branch Directors, heads of offices and United 
States Attorneys.

                        Section 7. Applicability

    This directive applies to all cases pending as of the date of this 
directive and is effective immediately.

                             [Memo No. 375]

Standards And Procedures With Respect To Criminal Prosecutions Involving 
           Certain Agricultural Marketing Quota Penalty Cases

    By virtue of the authority vested in me by part 0 of title 28 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations, particularly Sec. Sec. 0.55, 0.160, 0.162, 
0.164, 0.166, and 0.168, it is hereby ordered as follows:
    Section 1. Purpose. The purpose of this Memorandum is to prescribe 
standards and procedures for U.S. Attorneys with respect to the handling 
of the criminal aspects of agricultural marketing quota penalty cases 
which are submitted to the U.S. Attorneys by direct referral from the 
attorney in charge of the local office of the General Counsel of the 
Department of Agriculture (hereinafter in this Memorandum referred to as 
the General Counsel). Supplement No. 1 of October 26, 1955, to 
Memorandum No. 119 is hereby superseded. Attention is invited to the 
fact that Memorandum No. 374, of June 3, 1964, which superseded 
Memorandum No. 119 of December 8, 1954, deals with the civil aspects of 
agricultural marketing quota penalty cases.
    Sec. 2. Scope of authority. (a) The authority conferred by this 
Memorandum is applicable to alleged criminal violations involving the 
provisions of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended (7 
U.S.C. 1311-1376), in cases in which the gross amount involved does not 
exceed $5,000.
    (b) Matters involving alleged criminal violations of the 
Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended, shall be referred 
directly to the U.S. Attorney concerned by the attorney in charge of the 
local office of the General Counsel which has jurisdiction over any such 
matter requiring action. U.S. Attorneys may initiate criminal 
prosecution or decline to do so as they, in their judgment, may deem 
appropriate. U.S. Attorneys are, of course, urged to obtain the advice 
and assistance of this Department whenever they feel that such advice 
and assistance might be helpful.
    Sec. 3. Correspondence--(a) With the Department of Justice. 
Inquiries to the Department concerning any matters covered by this 
Memorandum should be directed to the attention of the Assistant Attorney 
General in charge of the Criminal Division (hereinafter in this 
Memorandum referred to as the Assistant Attorney General). Any such 
inquiry should be accompanied by copies of all pertinent correspondence 
and other documents, including the indictment if one shall have been 
returned, since files concerning these matters will not be maintained in 
Washington.
    (b) With the Department of Agriculture. Correspondence calling for 
additional factual details, and requests for investigations, documents, 
witnesses, and similar matters, should be directed to the General 
Counsel's attorney in charge who originated the matter. However, only 
the U.S. Attorney and his duly appointed assistants are authorized to 
exercise any control whatsoever over the handling of any such matter 
referred to the U.S. Attorney for action. The U.S. Attorney is charged 
with the entire responsibility for the manner in which such matters are 
handled.
    Sec. 4. Closing of the Prosecution. (a) U.S. Attorneys may decline 
to prosecute any case involving a matter covered by this Memorandum 
without prior consultation or approval of the Assistant Attorney 
General. If, however, prosecution has been initiated by way of 
indictment or information, the indictment or information shall not be 
dismissed until authority to do so has been obtained from the Assistant 
Attorney General or his representative unless the reason for the 
dismissal is one which does not necessitate the prior approval of the 
Criminal Division. (See U.S. Attorneys' Manual, title 2: Criminal 
Division, pages 18-20.)
    (b) In each instance in which a case is closed by a U.S. Attorney 
and in which prior approval of the Assistant Attorney General or his 
representative has not been obtained, a memorandum shall be prepared and 
placed in the file describing the action taken and the reasons therefor.
    Sec. 5. Appeals. The instructions existing with reference to 
criminal appeals shall govern appeals in cases covered by this 
Memorandum.

Redelegations of Authority to United States Attorneys, Deputy Assistant

                    Office, in the Criminal Division

    By virtue of the authority vested in me by part 0 of title 28 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations, as amended, particularly Sec. Sec. 0.160,

[[Page 88]]

0.162, 0.164, 0.168 and 0.171, it is hereby ordered as follows:
    (a)(1) Each U.S. Attorney is authorized in cases delegated to the 
Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division--
    (A) To accept or reject offers in compromise of--
    (i) Claims in behalf of the United States in all cases (other than 
forfeiture cases) in which the original claim did not exceed $500,000, 
and in all cases in which the original claim was between $500,000 and 
$5,000,000, so long as the difference between the gross amount of the 
original claim and the proposed settlement does not exceed 15 percent of 
the original claim; and in all civil or criminal forfeiture cases, 
except that the U.S. Attorney shall consult with the Asset Forfeiture 
Office of the Criminal Division before accepting offers in compromise or 
plea offers in forfeiture cases in which the orignial claim was 
$5,000,000 or more, and in forfeiture cases in which the original claim 
was between $500,000 and $5,000,000, when the difference between the 
gross amount of the original forfeiture sought and the proposed 
settlement exceeds 15 percent of the original claim; and
    (ii) Claims against the United States in all cases, or in 
administrative actions to settle, in which the amount of the proposed 
settlement does not exceed $500,000; and
    (B) To close (other than by compromise or entry of judgment) claims 
asserted by the United States in all cases (other than forfeiture cases) 
in which the gross amount of the original claim does not exceed 
$500,000, and in all civil or criminal forfeiture cases, except that the 
U.S. Attorney shall consult with the Asset Forfeiture Office of the 
Criminal Division before closing a forfeiture case in which the gross 
amount of the original forfeiture sought is $500,000 or more.
    (2) This subsection does not apply--
    (A) When, for any reason, the compromise or closing of a particular 
claim (other than a forfeiture case) will, as a practical matter, 
control or adversely influence the disposition of other claims, which, 
when added to the claim in question, total more than the respective 
amounts designated above;
    (B) When the U.S. Attorney is of the opinion that because of a 
question of law or policy presented, or for any other reason, the matter 
should receive the personal attention of the Assistant Attorney General;
    (C) When a settlement converts into a mandatory duty the otherwise 
discretionary authority of an agency or department to revise, amend, or 
promulgate regulations;
    (D) When a settlement commits a department or agency to expend funds 
that Congress has not appropriated and that have not been budgeted for 
the action in question, or commits a department or agency to seek a 
particular appropriation or budget authorization; or
    (E) When a settlement limits the discretion of a Secretary or agency 
administrator to make policy or managerial decisions committed to the 
Secretary or agency administrator by Congress or by the Constitution.
    (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Order, the Assistant 
Attorney General of the Criminal Division may delegate to U.S. Attorneys 
authority to compromise or close other cases, including those involving 
amounts greater than as set forth in paragraph (a) above, and up to the 
maximum limit of his authority, where the circumstances warrant such 
delegation.
    (c) All other authority delegated to me by Sec. Sec. 0.160, 0.162, 
0.164 and 0.171 of title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations not 
falling within the limitations of paragraph (a) of this Order is hereby 
redelegated to Section Chiefs in the Criminal Division, except that--
    (1) The authority delegated to me by Sec. Sec. 0.160, 0.162, 0.164 
and 0.171 of that title relating to conducting, handling, or supervising 
civil and criminal forfeiture litigation (other than bail bond 
forfeiture), including acceptance or denial of petitions for remission 
or mitigation of forfeiture, is hereby redelegated to the Director of 
the Asset Forfeiture Office; and
    (2) When a Section Chief or the Director of the Asset Forfeiture 
Office is of the opinion that because of a question of law or policy 
presented, or for any other reason, a matter described in paragraph (c) 
should receive the personal attention of a Deputy Assistant Attorney 
General or Assistant Attorney General, he shall refer the matter to the 
appropriate Deputy Assistant Attorney General or to the Assistant 
Attorney General.
    (d) Notwithstanding any of the above redelegations, when the agency 
or agencies involved have objected in writing to the proposed closing or 
dismissal of a case, or to the acceptance or rejection of an offer in 
compromise, any such unresolved objection shall be referred to the 
Assistant Attorney General for resolution.

of the authority vested in me by part 0 of title 28 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations, and particularly Sec. Sec. 0.65, 0.160, 0.162, 
0.164, 0.166, and 0.168 thereof, I hereby redelegate to the Deputy 
Assistant Attorney General, certain Section Chiefs, and to the United 
States Attorneys, the following authority to act in connection with, and 
to compromise, Land and Natural Resources Division cases:

                 Section I--Authority To Initiate Cases

    A. Delegation to United States Attorneys--1. Land Cases. United 
States Attorneys are hereby authorized to act in matters concerning real 
property of the United States, including tribal and restricted 
individual Indian land, not involving new or unusual questions or 
questions of title or water rights, on behalf of any other department or 
agency in response to a direct request in writing from an authorized 
field officer of the department or agency concerned, without prior 
authorization from the Land and Natural Resources Division, in the 
following-described cases:
    (a) Actions to recover possession of property from tenants, 
squatters, trespassers, or others, and actions to enjoin trespasses on 
Federal property;
    (b) Actions to recover damages resulting from trespasses when the 
amount of the claim for actual damage based upon an innocent trespass 
does not exceed $200,000 (The United States Attorneys may seek recovery 
of amounts exceeding $200,000 (i) if the actual damages are $200,000 or 
less and State statutes permit the recovery of multiple damages, e.g., 
double or treble, for either a willful or an innocent trespass; or (ii) 
if the actual damages are $200,000 or less, but the action is for 
conversion to obtain recovery of the enhanced value of property severed 
and removed in the trespass);
    (c) Actions to collect delinquent rentals or damages for use and 
occupancy of not more than $200,000;
    (d) Actions to collect costs of forest fire suppression and other 
damages resulting from such fires if the total claim does not exceed 
$200,000;
    (e) Actions to collect delinquent operation and maintenance charges 
accruing on Indian irrigation projects and federal reclamation projects 
of not more than $200,000; and
    (f) Actions to collect loans of money or livestock made by the 
United States to individual Indians without limitation on amount, 
including loans made by Indian tribal organizations to individual 
Indians if the loan agreements, notes and securities have been assigned 
by the tribal organizations to the United States.
    2. Environmental cases. Pursuant to paragraph 10 of the memorandum 
of understanding between the Department of Justice and the Environmental 
Protection Agency (42 FR 48942) with respect to the handling of 
litigation to which the Environmental Protection Agency is a party, all 
requests of the Environmental Protection Agency for litigation must be 
submitted by the Agency through its General Counsel or its Assistant 
Administrator for Enforcement to the Assistant Attorney General, except 
that matters requiring an immediate temporary restraining order may be 
submitted by regional Administrators of the Environmental Protection 
Agency simultaneously to a U.S. Attorney and the Assistant Attorney 
General. Consequently, except for matters requiring an immediate 
temporary restraining order, U.S. Attorneys are not authorized to accept 
on a direct reference basis any matters or cases originating in any 
office of the Environmental Protection Agency.
    U.S. Attorneys are authorized to act, without prior authorization 
from the Land and Natural Resources Division, on behalf of Federal 
departments or agencies other than the Environmental Protection Agency, 
in response to a direct request in writing from an authorized field 
officer of the department or agency concerned, in the following 
environmental cases:
    (a) Civil or criminal actions involving the filling or the deposit 
of dredged or fill material upon, or the alteration of the channels of, 
the waters of the United States, in violation of section 10 of the River 
and Harbor Act of March 3, 1899 (33 U.S.C. 403), or of section 404 of 
the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (33 U.S.C. 
1344), or of both statutes;
    (b) Civil or criminal actions involving the discharge of refuse into 
the navigable waters of the United States, and, in certain cases, their 
tributaries, in violation of section 13 of the Act of March 3, 1899 (33 
U.S.C. 407), except for
    (i) In rem actions against vessels, which actions shall continue to 
be handled in the manner set forth in departmental memorandums 374 and 
376, dated June 3, 1964, and shall continue to be under the jurisdiction 
of the Civil Division; and

[[Page 90]]

    (ii) Criminal actions involving the discharge either of oil or of 
hazardous substances, for which discharge a government agency either has 
imposed a civil penalty pursuant to section 311(b)(6) of the Federal 
Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(6)), 
or has under consideration the imposition of such a penalty.
    3. Notification to Division of Direct Referral. In each case 
referred to the United States Attorneys pursuant to the authority set 
forth in Subparagraphs 1 and 2 above, the United States Attorney shall, 
prior to taking action, assure that a copy of the authorized field 
officer's written request has been forwarded to the Assistant Attorney 
General, Land and Natural Resources Division, Department of Justice, 
Washington, DC, 20530.

      Section II--Authority To Compromise, Dismiss, or Close Cases

    A. Delegation to Deputy Assistant Attorney General. Subject to the 
limitations imposed by Paragraph D of this Section, the Deputy Assistant 
Attorney General in the Land and Natural Resources Division is hereby 
authorized, with respect to matters assigned to the Land and Natural 
Resources Division, to accept or reject offers in compromise of claims 
against the United States in which the amount of the proposed settlement 
does not exceed $500,000, and of claims in behalf of the United States 
in which the gross amount of the original claim does not exceed 
$500,000.
    B. Delegation to Section Chiefs. Subject to the limitations imposed 
by Paragraph D of this Section, the Chiefs of the Land Acquisition, 
Indian Claims, Pollution Control, Indian Resources, and General 
Litigation Sections of the Land and Natural Resources Division are 
hereby authorized, with respect to matters assigned to their respective 
sections, to accept or reject offers in compromise of claims against the 
United States in which the amount of the proposed settlement does not 
exceed $300,000, and of claims in behalf of the United States in which 
the gross amount of the original claim does not exceed $300,000.
    C. Delegations to United States Attorneys--1. Compromise of land 
cases. Subject to the limitations imposed by paragraph D of this 
section, U.S. Attorneys are authorized, without the prior approval of 
the Land and Natural Resources Division, to accept or reject offers in 
compromise in the direct referral land cases listed in subparagraph A-1 
of section I, and in claims against the United States in which the 
amount of the proposed settlement does not exceed $200,000, if the 
authorized field officer of the interested agency concurs in writing, 
except that where the United States is a plaintiff, a U.S. Attorney may 
accept an offer without the concurrence of the field officer if the 
acceptance is based solely upon the financial circumstances of the 
debtor.
    2. Compromise of environmental cases. Prior delegations of authority 
to the U.S. Attorneys to settle any type of case in which the Department 
of Justice represents the Environmental Protection Agency, or the 
Administrator or any other official of that Agency, are hereby revoked; 
all offers in compromise of such cases shall be submitted to the 
Assistant Attorney General of the Land and Natural Resources Division, 
for appropriate action.
    3. Compromise of Condemnation Cases. (a) Subject to the limitations 
imposed in Paragraph D of this section, United States Attorneys are 
hereby authorized, without the prior approval of the Land and Natural 
Resources Division, to accept or reject offers in compromise of claims 
against the United States for just compensation in condemnation 
proceedings in any case in which
    (i) The gross amount of the proposed settlement does not exceed 
$100,000; and
    (ii) The settlement is approved in writing (the written approval to 
be retained in the file of the United States Attorney concerned) by the 
authorized field representative of the acquiring agency if the amount of 
the settlement exceeds the amount deposited with the declaration of 
taking as to the particular tract of land involved; and
    (iii) The amount of the settlement is compatible with the sound 
appraisal, or appraisals, upon which the United States would rely as 
evidence in the event of trial, due regard being had for probable 
minimum trial costs and risks; and
    (iv) The case does not involve the revestment of any land or 
improvements or any interest, or interests, in land under the Act of 
October 21, 1942, 56 Stat. 797 (40 U.S.C. 258f). 3(b). When a United 
States Attorney has settled a condemnation proceeding under the 
authority conferred upon him by the foregoing subparagraph, he shall 
promptly secure the entry of judgment and distribution of the award, and 
shall take all other steps necessary to dispose of the matter 
completely. The United States Attorney concerned shall also immediately 
forward to the Department a report, in the form of a letter or 
memorandum, bearing his signature or showing his personal approval, 
stating the action taken and containing an adequate statement of the 
reasons therefor. In routine cases, a form, containing the minimum 
elements of the required report, may be used in lieu of a letter or 
memorandum. In any case, special care shall be taken to see that the 
report contains a statement as to what the valuation testimony of the 
United States would have been if the case had been tried.
    4. Closing or Dismissal of Matters and Cases. Subject to the 
limitations imposed in Paragraph D of this section, a direct referral 
matter described in Section I may be closed without action by the United 
States Attorney or, if filed in court, may be dismissed by

[[Page 91]]

him, if the field officer of the interested agency concurs in writing 
that it is without merit legally or factually. Except for claims on 
behalf of Indians or Indian tribes, the United States Attorney may close 
a claim without consulting the field officer of the interested agency if 
the claim is for money only and if he concludes (a) that the cost of 
collection under the circumstances would exceed the amount of the claim, 
or (b) that the claim is uncollectable. With respect to claims asserted 
by the United States on behalf of individual Indians or Indian tribes, 
the United States Attorney may close a claim without consulting the 
field officer of the interested agency if the claim is for money only 
and if he concludes that the claim is uncollectable; claims on behalf of 
Indian individuals and tribes may not be closed merely because the cost 
of collection might exceed the amount of the claim.
    D. Limitations on delegations. The authority to compromise, close or 
dismiss cases delegated by Paragraphs A, B and C of this section may not 
be exercised when,
    (a) For any reason, the compromise of a particular claim, as a 
practical matter, will control or adversely influence the disposition of 
other claims totaling more than the respective amounts designated above;
    (b) Because a novel question of law or a question of policy is 
presented, or for any other reason, the offer should, in the opinion of 
the officer or employee concerned, receive the personal attention of the 
Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Land and Natural Resources 
Division; and
    (c) The agency or agencies involved are opposed to the proposed 
closing or dismissal of a case, or acceptance or rejection of the offer 
in compromise.
    If any of the conditions listed above exist, the matter shall be 
submitted for resolution to the Assistant Attorney General in charge of 
the Land and Natural Resources Division.
    Effective date of this directive. This Directive shall be effective 
on December 8, 1976.

[41 FR 53660, Dec. 8, 1976, as amended at 43 FR 36069, Aug. 15, 1978; 51

the attention of the Assistant Attorney General, Environment and Natural 
Resources Division.

                            [Directive 1-86]

    Pursuant to the authority vested in me under 28 CFR Sec. 16.4(b)

                            [Directive 6-85]

Delegation of Authority to Chief, Land Acquisition Section, To Stipulate 
  or Agree in Behalf of the United States To Exclude Property Taken on 
    Behalf of the United States by Declaration of Taking or Otherwise

    Section 258f of the Declaration of Taking Act, 40 U.S.C. 258a, et 
seq., contains the following provision:
    In any condemnation proceeding instituted by or on behalf of the 
United States, the Attorney General is authorized to stipulate or agree 
in behalf of the United States to exclude any property or any part 
thereof, or any interest therein, that may have been, or may be, taken 
by or on behalf of the United States by declaration of taking or 
otherwise.
    The foregoing authority has been delegated to the Assistant Attorney 
General, Land and

[[Page 93]]

Natural Resources Division, by the Attorney General, chapter I, part O, 
subpart M, Sec. Sec. 0.65 and 0.160(a)(2), title 28, Code of Federal 
Regulations.
    In view of the frequency of agency requests that this office 
stipulate or agree to exclude property or parts of property taken by 
declaration of taking or otherwise, and in the interest of efficient 
administration of the duties and responsibilities of this office, I 
hereby make the following limited delegation of authority to stipulate 
or agree to such exclusions (revestments).
    The Chief, Land Acquisition Section, is authorized to stipulate or 
agree in behalf of the United States to exclude (revest) any property or 
any part thereof, or any interest therein, that may have been, or may be 
taken by or on behalf of the United States by declaration of taking or 
otherwise, when:
    1. The exclusion (revestment) has been requested or approved in 
writing by a duly authorized officer of the agency for which the 
property was taken; and
    2. In the case of a partial exclusion (revestment) in connection 
with an overall settlement of the case, the combined amount of the 
monetary payment of compensation and the government's appraised value of 
the land to be excluded (revested) does not exceed the monetary 
limitation on the Section Chief's settlement authority; or
    3. In the case of an exclusion (revestment) that is not part of an 
overall settlement of the case, the government's appraised value of the 
land to be excluded (revested) together with any payment of compensation 
for possession and/or litigation expenses do not exceed the monetary 
limitations of the Section Chief's settlement authority.
    Provided that the delegation of settlement authority shall not 
extend to any revestment which raises precedential questions or policy 
issues. In such instances, the decision on whether to stipulate or agree 
to exclusions of property shall remain with the Assistant Attorney 
General of the Land and Natural Resources Division.
    Effective Date: February 4, 1985.

[51 FR 12849, Apr. 16, 1986]

                            [Directive 6-83]

    By virtue of the authority vested in me by part 0 of title 28, Code 
of Federal Regulations Sec. 0.65, the Section Chief of the Wildlife and 
Marine Resources Section is now authorized to rule upon petitions for 
remission or mitigation of civil or criminal forfeitures filed with the 
Attorney General pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 
U.S.C. 1531-1543); the Lacey Act and related provisions (18 U.S.C. 41-
44, 47); the Airborne Hunting Act (16 U.S.C. 742j-1); the Migratory Bird 
Act (16 U.S.C. 701, et seq.); the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act 
(16 U.S.C. 668-668d); the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (16 U.S.C. 
661 et seq.); the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act (16 
U.S.C. 668dd, 668ee); the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management 
Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.); the Tuna Conventions Act (16 U.S.C. 951 et 
seq.); the Marine Mammal Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.,) the 
Sockeye Salmon or Pink Salmon Fishing Act (16 U.S.C. 776 et seq.); the 
Protection of Sea Otters on the High Seas Act (16 U.S.C. 1171 et seq.); 
the Northern Pacific Halibut Act (16 U.S.C. 772 et seq.); and the North 
Pacific Fisheries Act (16 U.S.C. 1021 et seq.).
    The Section Chief of the Wildlife and Marine Resources Section shall 
base his decision upon a review of all the pertinent facts including the 
petition for remission or mitigation, the report and recommendation of 
the appropriate United States Attorney, the report of the seizing law 
enforcement agency, and the report prepared within the Section.
    Following the adverse decision a petitioner may request the 
Assistant Attorney General for the Land and Natural Resources Division 
to review the decision of the Section Chief.
    The above directive shall be effective immediately and shall be the 
interim procedure in effect until promulgation of regulations by the 
Department of Justice which address the remission and mitigation process 
in the Land and Natural Resources Division.
    Effective Date: April 12, 1983.

[51 FR 12849, Apr. 16, 1986]

                            [Directive 6-81]

    This directive establishes the Division's policy of notice to 
appropriate state officials of action against states. The Chief of each 
section in the Land and Natural Resources Division shall:
    1. Insure that each attorney in his or her respective section reads, 
becomes familiar with, and complies with this directive.
    2. In each suit or claim brought against state government, agencies, 
and entities;
    (a) Satisfy the Deputy Assistant Attorney General to whom the 
section reports of compliance with this directive,
    (b) Before such suit or claim is brought, advise the Attorney 
General and governor of any affected state as to the nature of the 
contemplated action and the terms of the remedy sought and
    (c) Place a memorandum in the file of the case of matter, indicating 
compliance with this directive.
    Such prior notice may:
    (1) Result in settlement of the action in advance of its filing on 
terms acceptable to the United States,
    (2) Permit the state to bring to our attention facts or issues that 
may change our outlook on the action, or
    (3) Permit the State Attorney General and the Governor to respond 
knowledgeably to

[[Page 94]]

inquires from local officials and the media when the action is 
commenced.
    Because the actual situation covered by this directive may vary from 
section to section, no single detailed procedure can be established but 
common sense should prevail. To that end, the state through its Attorney 
General and Governor should get fair warning and an opportunity to 
resolve the litigation. The notice should be given sufficiently in 
advance of the contemplated action to allow state officials to respond.
    Where a Section Chief believes he has good cause to seek an 
exception from the terms of this directive he should discuss the matter 
with the Deputy Assistant Attorney General to whom he or she reports.
    Effective Date: April 27, 1981.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1  Submission of petition; form to be used; contents of petition.

    A person seeking executive clemency by pardon, reprieve, commutation 
of sentence, or remission of fine shall execute a formal petition. The 
petition shall be addressed to the President of the United States and 
shall be submitted to the Pardon Attorney, Department of Justice, 
Washington, DC 20530, except for petitions relating to military 
offenses. Petitions and other required forms may be obtained from the 
Pardon Attorney. Petition forms for commutation of sentence also may be 
obtained from the wardens of federal penal institutions. A petitioner 
applying for executive clemency with respect to military offenses should 
submit his or her petition directly to the Secretary of the military 
department that had original jurisdiction over the court-martial trial 
and conviction of the petitioner. In such a case, a form furnished by 
the Pardon Attorney may be used but should be modified to meet the needs 
of the particular case. Each petition for executive clemency should 
include the information required in the form prescribed by the Attorney 
General.


<R05>
Sec. 1.2  Eligibility for filing petition for pardon.

    No petition for pardon should be filed until the expiration of a 
waiting period of at least five years after the date of the release of 
the petitioner from confinement or, in case no prison sentence was 
imposed, until the expiration of a period of at least five years after 
the date of the conviction of the petitioner. Generally, no petition 
should be submitted by a person who is on probation, parole, or 
supervised release.


<R05>
Sec. 1.3  Eligibility for filing petition for commutation of sentence.

    No petition for commutation of sentence, including remission of 
fine, should be filed if other forms of judicial or administrative 
relief are available, except upon a showing of exceptional 
circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 1.4  Offenses against the laws of possessions or territories of the 

United States.

    Petitions for executive clemency shall relate only to violations of 
laws of the United States. Petitions relating to violations of laws of 
the possessions of the United States or territories subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States should be submitted to the appropriate 
official or agency of the possession or territory concerned.


<R05>
Sec. 1.5  Disclosure of files.

    Petitions, reports, memoranda, and communications submitted or 
furnished in connection with the consideration of a petition for 
executive clemency generally shall be available only to the officials 
concerned with the consideration of the petition. However, they may be 
made available for inspection, in whole or in part, when in the judgment 
of the Attorney General their disclosure is required by law or the ends 
of justice.


<R05>
Sec. 1.6  Consideration of petitions; notification of victims; 

recommendations to the President.

    (a) Upon receipt of a petition for executive clemency, the Attorney 
General shall cause such investigation to be made of the matter as he or 
she may deem necessary and appropriate, using the services of, or 
obtaining reports

[[Page 102]]

from, appropriate officials and agencies of the Government, including 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
    (b)(1) When a person requests clemency (in the form of either a 
commutation of a sentence or a pardon after serving a sentence) for a 
conviction of a felony offense for which there was a victim, and the 
Attorney General concludes from the information developed in the 
clemency case that investigation of the clemency case warrants 
contacting the victim, the Attorney General shall cause reasonable 
effort to be made to notify the victim or victims of the crime for which 
clemency is sought:
    (i) That a clemency petition has been filed;
    (ii) That the victim may submit comments regarding clemency; and
    (iii) Whether the clemency request ultimately is granted or denied 
by the President.
    (2) In determining whether contacting the victim is warranted, the 
Attorney General shall consider the seriousness and recency of the 
offense, the nature and extent of the harm to the victim, the 
defendant's overall criminal history and history of violent behavior, 
and the likelihood that clemency could be recommended in the case.
    (3) For the purposes of this paragraph (b), ``victim'' means an 
individual who:
    (i) Has suffered direct or threatened physical, emotional, or 
pecuniary harm as a result of the commission of the crime for which 
clemency is sought (or, in the case of an individual who died or was 
rendered incompetent as a direct and proximate result of the commission 
of the crime for which clemency is sought, one of the following 
relatives of the victim (in order of preference): the spouse; an adult 
offspring; or a parent); and
    (ii) Has on file with the Federal Bureau of Prisons a request to be 
notified pursuant to 28 CFR 551.152 of the offender's release from 
custody.
    (4) For the purposes of this paragraph (b), ``reasonable effort'' is 
satisfied by mailing to the last-known address reported by the victim to 
the Federal Bureau of Prisons under 28 CFR 551.152.
    (5) The provisions of this paragraph (b) apply to clemency cases 
filed on or after September 28, 2000.
    (c) The Attorney General shall review each petition and all 
pertinent information developed by the investigation and shall determine 
whether the request for clemency is of sufficient merit to warrant 
favorable action by the President. The Attorney General shall report in 
writing his or her recommendation to the President, stating whether in 
his or her judgment the President should grant or deny the petition.

[Order No. 2323-2000, 65 FR 58223, Sept. 28, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 1.7  Notification of grant of clemency.

    When a petition for pardon is granted, the petitioner or his or her 
attorney shall be notified of such action and the warrant of pardon 
shall be mailed to the petitioner. When commutation of sentence is 
granted, the petitioner shall be notified of such action and the warrant 
of a commutation shall be sent to the petitioner through the officer in 
charge of his or her place of confinement, or directly to the petitioner 
if he/she is on parole, probation, or supervised release.


<R05>
Sec. 1.8  Notification of denial of clemency.

    (a) Whenever the President notifies the Attorney General that he has 
denied a request for clemency, the Attorney General shall so advise the 
petitioner and close the case.
    (b) Except in cases in which a sentence of death has been imposed, 
whenever the Attorney General recommends that the President deny a 
request for clemency and the President does not disapprove or take other 
action with respect to that adverse recommendation within 30 days after 
the date of its submission to him, it shall be presumed that the 
President concurs in that adverse recommendation of the Attorney 
General, and the Attorney General shall so advise the petitioner and 
close the case.


<R05>
Sec. 1.9  Delegation of authority.

    The Attorney General may delegate to any officer of the Department 
of

[[Page 103]]

Justice any of his or her duties or responsibilities under Sec. Sec. 
1.1 through 1.8.


<R05>
Sec. 1.10  Procedures applicable to prisoners under a sentence of death 

imposed by a United States District Court.

    The following procedures shall apply with respect to any request for 
clemency by a person under a sentence of death imposed by a United 
States District Court for an offense against the United States. Other 
provisions set forth in this part shall also apply to the extent they 
are not inconsistent with this section.
    (a) Clemency in the form of reprieve or commutation of a death 
sentence imposed by a United States District Court shall be requested by 
the person under the sentence of death or by the person's attorney 
acting with the person's written and signed authorization.
    (b) No petition for reprieve or commutation of a death sentence 
should be filed before proceedings on the petitioner's direct appeal of 
the judgment of conviction and first petition under 28 U.S.C. 2255 have 
terminated. A petition for commutation of sentence should be filed no 
later than 30 days after the petitioner has received notification from 
the Bureau of Prisons of the scheduled date of execution. All papers in 
support of a petition for commutation of sentence should be filed no 
later than 15 days after the filing of the petition itself. Papers filed 
by the petitioner more than 15 days after the commutation petition has 
been filed may be excluded from consideration.
    (c) The petitioner's clemency counsel may request to make an oral 
presentation of reasonable duration to the Office of the Pardon Attorney 
in support of the clemency petition. The presentation should be 
requested at the time the clemency petition is filed. The family or 
families of any victim of an offense for which the petitioner was 
sentenced to death may, with the assistance of the prosecuting office, 
request to make an oral presentation of reasonable duration to the 
Office of the Pardon Attorney.
    (d) Clemency proceedings may be suspended if a court orders a stay 
of execution for any reason other than to allow completion of the 
clemency proceeding.
    (e) Only one request for commutation of a death sentence will be 
processed to completion, absent a clear showing of exceptional 
circumstances.
    (f) The provisions of this Sec. 1.10 apply to any person under a 
sentence of death imposed by a United States District Court for whom an 
execution date is set on or after August 1, 2000.

[Order No. 2317-2000, 65 FR 48381, August 8, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 1.11  Advisory nature of regulations.

    The regulations contained in this part are advisory only and for the 
internal guidance of Department of Justice personnel. They create no 
enforceable rights in persons applying for executive clemency, nor do 
they restrict the authority granted to the President under Article II, 
section 2 of the Constitution.

<R05>
Sec. 2.2  Eligibility for parole; adult sentences.

    (a) A Federal prisoner serving a maximum term or terms of more than 
one year imposed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 4205 (a) (or pursuant to former 
18 U.S.C. 4202) may be released on parole in the discretion of the 
Commission after completion of one-third of such term or terms, or after 
completion of ten years of a life sentence or of a sentence of over 
thirty years.
    (b) A Federal prisoner serving a maximum term or terms of more than 
one year imposed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 4205(b)(1) (or pursuant to former 
18 U.S.C. 4208(a)(1)) may be released on parole in the discretion of the 
Commission after completion of the court-designated minimum term, which 
may be less than but not more than one-third of the maximum sentence

    (c) A Federal prisoner serving a maximum term or terms of more than

committed on or after October 12, 1984, and the Court imposes a term or 
terms under 26 U.S.C. 5871, the prisoner is eligible for parole only 
after service of one-third of such term or terms, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 
4205(a).
    (e) A Federal prisoner serving a maximum term or terms of one year

<R05>
Sec. 2.3  Same: Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act.

    A Federal prisoner committed under the Narcotic Addict 
Rehabilitation Act may be released on parole in the discretion of the 
Commission after completion of at least six months in treatment, not 
including any period of time for ``study'' prior to final judgment of 
the court. Before parole is ordered by the Commission, the Surgeon 
General or his designated representative must certify that the prisoner 
has made sufficient progress to warrant his release and the Attorney 
General or his designated representative must also report to the 
Commission whether the prisoner should be released. Recertification by 
the Surgeon General prior to reparole consideration is not required (18 
U.S.C. 4254).

<R05>
Sec. 2.5  Sentence aggregation.

    When multiple sentences are aggregated by the Bureau of Prisons 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 4161 and 4205, such sentences are treated as a

Commission pursuant to these rules, and the prisoner has a single parole 
eligibility date as determined by the Bureau of Prisons.

<R05>
Sec. 2.6  Withheld and forfeited good time.

    While neither a forfeiture of good time nor a withholding of good 
time shall bar a prisoner from receiving a parole hearing, section 4206 
of title 18 of the U.S. Code permits the Commission to parole only those 
prisoners who have substantially observed the rules of the institution.

[43 FR 38822, Aug. 31, 1978]


<R05>
Sec. 2.7  Committed fines and restitution orders.

    (a) Committed fines. In any case in which a prisoner shall have had 
a fine imposed upon him by the committing court for which he is to stand 
committed until it is paid or until he is otherwise discharged according 
to law, such prisoner shall not be released on parole or mandatory 
release until payment of the fine, or until the fine commitment order is 
discharged according to law under the regulations of the Bureau of 
Prisons. Discharge from the commitment obligation of any committed fine 
does not discharge the prisoner's obligation to pay the fine as a debt 
due the United States.
    (b) Restitution orders. Where a prisoner applying for parole is 
under an order of restitution, and it appears that the prisoner has the 
ability to pay and has willfully failed to do so, the Commission shall 
require that approval of a parole release plan be contingent upon the 
prisoner first satisfying such restitution order. The prisoner shall be 
notified that failure to satisfy this condition shall result in 
retardation of parole under the provisions of Sec. 2.28(e).

Sec. 2.8  Mental competency proceedings.

    (a) Whenever a prisoner (or parolee) is scheduled for a hearing in 
accordance with the provisions of this part and reasonable doubt exists 
as to his mental competency, i.e., his ability to understand the nature 
of and participate in scheduled proceedings, a preliminary inquiry to 
determine his mental competency shall be conducted by the hearing panel, 
hearing examiner or other official (including a U.S. Probation Officer) 
designated by the Regional Commissioner.
    (b) The hearing examiner(s) or designated official shall receive 
oral or written psychiatric or psychological testimony and other 
evidence that may be available. A preliminary determination of mental 
competency shall be made upon the testimony, evidence, and personal 
observation of the prisoner (or parolee). If the examiner(s) or 
designated official determines that the prisoner is mentally competent, 
the previously scheduled hearing shall be held. If they determine that 
the prisoner is not mentally competent, the previously scheduled hearing 
shall be temporarily postponed.
    (c) Whenever the hearing examiner(s) or designated official 
determine that a prisoner is mentally incompetent and postpone the 
previously scheduled hearing, they shall forward the record of the 
preliminary hearing with their findings to the Regional Commissioner for 
review.
    (1) In the case of a prisoner, if the Regional Commissioner concurs 
with their findings, the Commissioner shall order the temporarily 
postponed hearing to be postponed indefinitely until such time as it is 
determined that the prisoner has recovered sufficiently to understand 
the proceedings. The Regional Commissioner shall require a progress 
report on the mental health of the prisoner at least every six months. 
When the Regional Commissioner determines that the prisoner has 
recovered sufficiently, the Commissioner shall reschedule the hearing 
for the earliest feasible date.
    (2) In the case of a parolee in a revocation proceeding, the 
Regional Commissioner shall postpone the revocation hearing and order 
that the parolee be given a mental health examination in a suitable 
facility of the Bureau of Prisons or the District of Columbia. The 
postponed revocation hearing shall be held within 60 days, or as soon as 
a satisfactory mental health report is submitted. The Regional 
Commissioner shall order that appointment of counsel be sought in any 
case where the parolee does not have counsel for the revocation hearing. 
If the parolee's mental incompetency is raised at a preliminary 
interview or probable cause hearing, the Commission (or hearing 
official) will make a determination of probable cause and, if probable 
cause is found, schedule a revocation hearing as provided in this 
paragraph.
    (d) If the Regional Commissioner disagrees with the findings of the 
hearing examiner(s) or designated official as to the mental competency 
of the prisoner, he shall take such action as he deems appropriate.
    (e) At a postponed revocation hearing under this section, the 
hearing examiner shall make a preliminary determination as to the 
parolee's mental competency, taking into account all available mental 
health reports, any evidence submitted on the parolee's behalf, any 
report from counsel as to counsel's ability to communicate with the 
parolee, and the parolee's own responses to the examiner's questioning.
    (1) If the hearing examiner determines the parolee to be mentally 
competent, the examiner shall conduct the revocation hearing. If counsel 
has previously asserted the parolee's incompetence, the examiner shall 
offer counsel a brief recess to consult with the parolee before 
proceeding.
    (2) If the hearing examiner determines the parolee to be mentally 
incompetent, the examiner shall conduct the revocation hearing, and 
shall take into full account the parolee's mental condition in 
determining the facts and recommending a decision as to revocation and 
reparole.
    (3) If the Commission revokes parole, the Commission may grant 
reparole conditioned on the parolee's acceptance into a particular type 
of mental health program prior to release from prison, or may grant 
reparole with a special condition of supervision that requires 
appropriate mental health treatment, including medication. In

[[Page 108]]

cases where no other option appears appropriate, the Commission may 
grant reparole conditioned upon the parolee's voluntary self-commitment 
to a mental health institution until such time as the parolee has 
sufficiently recovered for the Commission to permit the parolee's return 
to supervision.
    (4) If the Commission finds that the parolee did not commit the 
charged violations of parole, but also finds that the parolee is unable 
to fulfill the normal obligations of a parolee by reason of his mental 
condition, the Commission may reinstate the parolee to parole with any 
appropriate special condition, including the special condition, if 
necessary, that the parolee voluntarily commit himself to a mental 
institution until such time as the parolee has sufficiently recovered 
for the Commission to permit a return to supervision.

Sec. 2.9  Study prior to sentencing.

    When an adult Federal offender has been committed to an institution 
by the sentencing court for observation and study prior to sentencing, 
under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 4205(c), the report to the sentencing 
court is prepared and submitted directly by the Bureau of Prisons.

Sec. 2.10  Date service of sentence commences.

    (a) Service of a sentence of imprisonment commences to run on the 
date on which the person is received at the penitentiary, reformatory, 
or jail for service of the sentence: Provided, however, That any such 
person shall be allowed credit toward the service of his sentence for 
any days spent in custody in connection with the offense or acts for 
which sentence was imposed.
    (b) The imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for civil contempt 
shall interrupt the running of any sentence of imprisonment being served 
at the time the sentence of civil contempt is imposed, and the sentence 
or sentences so interrupted shall not commence to run again until the 
sentence of civil contempt is lifted.
    (c) Service of the sentence of a committed youth offender or person 
committed under the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act commences to run 
from the date of conviction and is interrupted only when such prisoner 
or parolee:
    (1) Is on court-ordered bail;
    (2) Is in escape status;
    (3) Has absconded from parole supervision; or
    (4) Comes within the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 2.11  Application for parole; notice of hearing.

    (a) A federal prisoner (including a committed youth offender or 
prisoner sentenced under the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act) 
desiring to apply for parole shall execute an application form as 
prescribed by the Commission. Such forms shall be available at each 
federal institution and shall be provided to each prisoner who is 
eligible for an initial parole hearing pursuant to Sec. 2.12. Prisoners 
committed under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act shall be considered 
for parole without application and may not waive parole consideration. A 
prisoner who receives an initial hearing need not apply for subsequent 
hearings.
    (b) A prisoner may knowingly and intelligently waive any parole 
consideration on a form provided for that purpose. If a prisoner waives 
parole consideration, he may later apply for parole and may be heard 
during the next visit of the Commission to the institution at which he 
is confined, provided that he has applied at least 60 days prior to the 
first day of the month in which such visit of the Commission occurs.
    (c) A prisoner who declines either to apply for or waive parole 
consideration is deemed to have waived parole consideration.
    (d) In addition to the above procedures relating to parole 
application, all prisoners prior to initial hearing shall be provided 
with an inmate background statement by the Bureau of Prisons for 
completion by the prisoner.

[[Page 109]]

    (e) At least sixty days prior to the initial hearing (and prior to 
any hearing conducted pursuant to Sec. 2.14), the prisoner shall be 
provided with written notice of the time and place of the hearing and of 
his right to review the documents to be considered by the Commission, as 
provided by Sec. 2.55. A prisoner may waive such notice, except that if 
such notice is not waived, the case shall be continued to the time of 
the next regularly scheduled proceeding of the Commission at the 
institution in which the prisoner is confined.

<R05>
Sec. 2.12  Initial hearings: Setting presumptive release dates.

    (a) An initial hearing shall be conducted within 120 days of a 
prisoner's arrival at a federal institution or as soon thereafter as 
practicable; except that in a case of a prisoner with a minimum term of 
parole ineligibility of ten years or more, the initial hearing will be 
conducted nine months prior to the completion of such a minimum term, or 
as soon thereafter as practicable.
    (b) Following initial hearing, the Commission shall (1) set a 
presumptive release date (either by parole or by mandatory release) 
within fifteen years of the hearing; (2) set an effective date of 
parole; or (3) continue the prisoner to a fifteen year reconsideration 
hearing pursuant to Sec. 2.14(c).
    (c) Notwithstanding the above paragraph, a prisoner may not be 
paroled earlier than the completion of any judicially set minimum term 
of imprisonment or other period of parole ineligibility fixed by law.
    (d) A presumptive parole date shall be contingent upon an 
affirmative finding by the Commission that the prisoner has a continued 
record of good conduct and a suitable release plan and shall be subject 
to the provisions of Sec. Sec. 2.14 and 2.28. In the case of a prisoner 
sentenced under the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act, 18 U.S.C. 4254, 
a presumptive parole date shall also be contingent upon certification by 
the Surgeon General pursuant to Sec. 2.3 of these rules. Consideration 
of disciplinary infractions in cases with presumptive parole dates may 
be deferred until the commencement of the next in-person hearing or the 
prerelease record review required by Sec. 2.14(b). While prisoners are 
encouraged to earn the restoration of forfeited or withheld good time, 
the Commission will consider the prisoner's overall institutional record 
in determining whether the conditions of a presumptive parole date have 
been satisfied.

Sec. 2.13  Initial hearing; procedure.

    (a) An initial hearing shall be conducted by a single hearing 
examiner unless the Regional Commissioner orders that the hearing be 
conducted by a panel of two examiners. The examiner shall discuss with 
the prisoner his offense severity rating and salient factor score as 
described in Sec. 2.20, his institutional conduct and, in addition, any 
other matter the examiner may deem relevant.
    (b) A prisoner may be represented at a hearing by a person of his or 
her choice. The function of the prisoner's representative shall be to 
offer a statement at the conclusion of the interview of the prisoner by 
the examiner, and to provide such additional information as the examiner 
shall request. Interested parties who oppose parole may select a 
representative to appear and offer a statement. The hearing examiner 
shall limit or exclude any irrelevant or repetitious statement.
    (c) At the conclusion of the hearing, the examiner shall discuss the 
decision to be recommended by the examiner and the reasons therefor, 
except in the extraordinary circumstance of a complex issue that 
requires further deliberation before a recommendation can be made. 
Written notice of the decision shall be mailed or transmitted to the 
prisoner within 21 days of the date of the hearing, except in 
emergencies. Whenever the Commission initially establishes a release 
date (or modifies the release date thereafter), the prisoner shall also 
receive in writing the reasons therefor.

[[Page 110]]

    (d) In accordance with 18 U.S.C. 4206, the reasons for establishment 
of a release date shall include a guidelines evaluation statement 
containing the prisoner's offense severity rating and salient factor 
score (including the points credited on each item of such score) as 
described in Sec. 2.20, as well as the specific factors and information 
relied upon for any decision outside the range indicated by the 
guidelines.
    (e) No interviews with the Commission, or any representative 
thereof, shall be granted to a prisoner unless his name is docketed for 
a hearing in accordance with Commission procedures. Hearings shall not 
be open to the public.
    (f) A full and complete record of every hearing shall be retained by 
the Commission. Upon a request, pursuant to Sec. 2.56, the Commission 
shall make available to any eligible prisoner such record as the 
Commission has retained of the hearing.

Sec. 2.14  Subsequent proceedings.

    (a) Interim proceedings. The purpose of an interim hearing required 
by 18 U.S.C. 4208(h) shall be to consider any significant developments 
or changes in the prisoner's status that may have occurred subsequent to 
the initial hearing.
    (1) Notwithstanding a previously ordered presumptive release date or 
fifteen year reconsideration hearing, interim hearings shall be 
conducted pursuant to the procedures of Sec. 2.13(b), (c), (e), and (f) 
at the following intervals from the date of the last hearing:
    (i) In the case of a prisoner with a maximum term or terms of less 
than seven years, every eighteen months (until released);
    (ii) In the case of a prisoner with a maximum term or terms of seven 
years or more, every twenty-four months (until released);
    (iii) In the case of a prisoner with an unsatisfied minimum term, 
the first interim hearing shall be scheduled under paragraphs (a)(1)(i) 
or (ii) of this section, or on the docket of hearings that is nine 
months prior to the month of parole eligibility, whichever is later.
    (2) Following an interim hearing, the Commission may:
    (i) Order no change in the previous decision;
    (ii) Advance a presumptive release date, or the date of a fifteen 
year reconsideration hearing. However, it shall be the policy of the 
Commission that once set, a presumptive release date or the date of a 
fifteen year reconsideration hearing shall be advanced only:
    (1) For superior program achievement under the provisions of Sec. 
2.60; or
    (2) For other clearly exceptional circumstances.
    (iii) Retard or rescind a presumptive parole date for reason of 
disciplinary infractions. In a case in which disciplinary infractions 
have occurred, the interim hearing shall be conducted in accordance with 
the procedures of Sec. 2.34(c) through (f). (Prior to each interim 
hearing, prisoners shall be notified on the progress report furnished by 
the Bureau of Prisons that any finding of misconduct by the Discipline 
Hearing Officer since the previous hearing will be considered for 
possible action under this paragraph);
    (iv) If a presumptive date falls within nine months after the date 
of an interim hearing, the Commission may treat the interim hearing as a 
prerelease review in lieu of the record review required by paragraph (b) 
of this section.
    (b) Pre-release reviews. The purpose of a pre-release review shall 
be to determine whether the conditions of a presumptive release date by 
parole have been satisfied.
    (1) At least sixty days prior to a presumptive parole date, the case 
shall be reviewed on the record, including a current institutional 
progress report.
    (2) Following review, the Regional Commissioner may:
    (i) Approve the parole date;
    (ii) Advance or retard the parole date for purpose of release 
planning as provided by Sec. 2.28(e);
    (iii) Retard the parole date or commence rescission proceedings as 
provided by Sec. 2.34;

[[Page 111]]

    (iv) Advance the parole date for superior program achievement under 
the provisions of Sec. 2.60.
    (3) A pre-release review pursuant to this section shall not be 
required if an in-person hearing has been held within nine months of the 
parole date.
    (4) Where:
    (i) There has been no finding of misconduct by an Institutional 
Disciplinary Committee nor any allegation of criminal conduct since the 
last hearing; and
    (ii) No other modification of the release date appears warranted, 
the Executive Hearing Examiner may act for the Regional Commissioner 
under paragraph (b)(2) of this section to approve conversion of the 
presumptive parole date to an effective date of parole.
    (c) Fifteen year reconsideration hearings. A fifteen year 
reconsideration hearing shall be a full reassessment of the case 
pursuant to the procedures at Sec. 2.13.
    (1) A fifteen year reconsideration hearing shall be ordered 
following initial hearing in any case in which a release date is not 
set.
    (2) Following a fifteen year reconsideration hearing, the Commission 
may take any one of the actions authorized by Sec. 2.12(b).

Sec. 2.15  Petition for consideration of parole prior to date set at hearing.

    When a prisoner has served the minimum term of imprisonment required 
by law, the Bureau of Prisons may petition the responsible Regional 
Commissioner for reopening the case under Sec. 2.28(a) and 
consideration for parole prior to the date set by the Commission at the 
initial or review hearing. The petition must show cause why it should be 
granted, i.e., an emergency, hardship, or the existence of other 
extraordinary circumstances that would warrant consideration of early 
parole.

Sec. 2.16  Parole of prisoner in state, local, or territorial institution.

    (a) Any person who is serving a sentence of imprisonment for any 
offense against the United States, but who is confined therefor in a 
state reformatory or other state or territorial institution, shall be 
eligible for parole by the Commission on the same terms and conditions, 
by the same authority, and subject to recommittal for the violation of 
such parole, as though he were confined in a Federal penitentiary, 
reformatory, or other correctional institution.
    (b) Federal prisoners serving concurrent state and Federal sentences 
in state, local, or territorial institutions shall be furnished upon 
request parole application forms. Upon receipt of the application and 
any supplementary classification material submitted by the institution, 
parole consideration shall be made by an examiner panel of the 
appropriate region on the record only. If such prisoner is released from 
his state sentence prior to a Federal grant of parole, he shall be given 
a personal hearing as soon as feasible after receipt at a Federal 
institution.
    (c) Prisoners who are serving Federal sentences exclusively but who 
are being boarded in State, local, or territorial institutions may be 
provided hearings at such facilities or may be transferred by the Bureau 
of Prisons to Federal Institutions for hearings by examiner panels of 
the Commission.

<R05>
Sec. 2.17  Original jurisdiction cases.

    (a) Following any hearing conducted pursuant to these rules, the 
Regional Commissioner may designate that a case should be decided as an 
original jurisdiction case. If the Regional Commissioner makes such a 
designation, the Regional Commissioner shall vote on the case and then 
refer the case to the other Commissioners for their votes. The decision 
in an original jurisdiction case shall be made on the basis of a 
majority vote of Commissioners holding office at the time of the 
decision.

[[Page 112]]

    (b) The following criteria will be used in designating cases as 
original jurisdiction cases:
    (1) Prisoners who have committed serious crimes against the security 
of the Nation, e.g., espionage or aggravated subversive activity.
    (2) Prisoners whose offense behavior:
    (i) Involved an unusual degree of sophistication or planning, or
    (ii) Was part of a large scale criminal conspiracy or a continuing 
criminal enterprise.
    (3) Prisoners who have received national or unusual attention 
because of the nature of the crime, arrest, trial, or prisoner status, 
or because of the community status of the offender or his victim.
    (4) Long-term sentences. Prisoners sentenced to a maximum term of 
forty-five years (or more) or prisoners serving life sentences.
    (c)(1) Any case designated for the original jurisdiction of the 
Commission shall remain an original jurisdiction case unless designation 
is removed pursuant to this subsection.
    (2) A case found to be inappropriately designated for the 
Commission's original jurisdiction, or to no longer warrant such 
designation, may be removed from original jurisdiction under the 
procedures specified in paragraph (a) of this section following a 
regularly scheduled hearing or the reopening of the case pursuant to 
Sec. 2.28. Removal from original jurisdiction may also occur by 
majority vote of the Commission considering a petition for 
reconsideration pursuant to Sec. 2.27. Where the circumstances warrant, 
a case may be redesignated as original jurisdiction pursuant to the 
provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

Sec. 2.18  Granting of parole.

    The granting of parole to an eligible prisoner rests in the 
discretion of the U.S. Parole Commission. As prerequisites to a grant of 
parole, the Commission must determine that the prisoner has 
substantially observed the rules of the institution or institutions in 
which he has been confined; and upon consideration of the nature and 
circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the 
prisoner, must determine that release would not depreciate the 
seriousness of his offense or promote disrespect for the law, and that 
release would not jeopardize the public welfare (i.e., that there is a 
reasonable probability that, if released, the prisoner would live and 
remain at liberty without violating the law or the conditions of his 
parole).


<R05>
Sec. 2.19  Information considered.

    (a) In making a parole or reparole determination the Commission 
shall consider, if available and relevant:
    (1) Reports and recommendations which the staff of the facility in 
which such prisoner is confined may make;
    (2) Official reports of the prisoner's prior criminal record, 
including a report or record of earlier probation and parole 
experiences;
    (3) Pre-sentence investigation reports;
    (4) Recommendations regarding the prisoner's parole made at the time 
of sentencing by the sentencing judge and prosecuting attorney;
    (5) Reports of physical, mental, or psychiatric examination of the 
offender; and
    (6) A statement, which may be presented orally or otherwise, by any 
victim of the offense for which the prisoner is imprisoned about the 
financial, social, psychological, and emotional harm done to, or loss 
suffered by such victim.
    (b)(1) There shall also be taken into consideration such additional 
relevant information concerning the prisoner (including information 
submitted by the prisoner) as may be reasonably available (18 U.S.C. 
4207). The Commission encourages the submission of relevant information 
concerning an eligible prisoner by interested persons.
    (2) To permit adequate review of information concerning the 
prisoner, materials submitted to the Commission should be received by 
the Commission no later than the first day of the month preceding the 
month of the scheduled hearing docket.
    (3) If material of more than six (6), double-spaced, letter-sized 
pages is

[[Page 113]]

first submitted at the time of the hearing (or preliminary interview) 
and the hearing panel (or person conducting the hearing or preliminary 
interview) concludes that it is not feasible to read all the material at 
that time, the person submitting the material will be permitted to 
summarize it briefly at the hearing (or preliminary interview). All of 
the material submitted will become part of the record to be considered 
by the Commission in its review of the proceedings.
    (4) The Commission will normally consider only verbal and written 
evidence at hearings. Recorded audio and visual material will be 
reviewed at hearings only if there is no adequate substitute to permit a 
finding under paragraph (c) of this section. Otherwise, recorded audio 
and visual material should be submitted prior to the hearing for review 
and summarization, pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (c) The Commission may take into account any substantial information 
available to it in establishing the prisoner's offense severity rating, 
salient factor score, and any aggravating or mitigating circumstances, 
provided the prisoner is apprised of the information and afforded an 
opportunity to respond. If the prisoner disputes the accuracy of the 
information presented, the Commission shall resolve such dispute by the 
preponderance of the evidence standard; that is, the Commission shall 
rely upon such information only to the extent that it represents the 
explanation of the facts that best accords with reason and probability. 
If the Commission is given evidence of criminal behavior that has been 
the subject of an acquittal in a federal, state, or local court, the 
Commission may consider that evidence if:
    (1) The Commission finds that it cannot adequately determine the 
prisoner's suitability for release on parole, or to remain on parole, 
unless the evidence is taken into account;
    (2) The Commission is satisfied that the record before it is 
adequate notwithstanding the acquittal;
    (3) The prisoner has been given the opportunity to respond to the 
evidence before the Commission; and
    (4) The evidence before the Commission meets the preponderance 
standard.


In any other case, the Commission shall defer to the trial jury. Offense 
behavior in Category 5 or above shall presumptively support a finding 
under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (d) Recommendations and information from sentencing judges, defense 
attorneys, prosecutors, and other interested parties are welcomed by the 
Commission. In evaluating a recommendation concerning parole, the 
Commission must consider the degree to which such recommendation 
provides the Commission with specific facts and reasoning relevant to 
the statutory criteria for parole (18 U.S.C. 4206) and the application 
of the Commission's guidelines (including reasons for departure 
therefrom). Thus, to be most helpful, a recommendation should state its 
underlying factual basis and reasoning. However, no recommendation 
(including a prosecutorial recommendation pursuant to a plea agreement) 
may be considered as binding upon the Commission's discretionary 
authority to grant or deny parole.

consistent exercise of discretion, and enable fairer and more equitable 
decision-making without removing individual case consideration, the U.S. 
Parole Commission has adopted guidelines for parole release 
consideration.
    (b) These guidelines indicate the customary range of time to be 
served before release for various combinations of offense (severity) and 
offender (parole prognosis) characteristics. The time ranges specified 
by the guidelines are established specifically for cases with good 
institutional adjustment and program progress.
    (c) These time ranges are merely guidelines. Where the circumstances

[[Page 114]]

warrant, decisions outside of the guidelines (either above or below) may 
be rendered.
    (d) The guidelines contain instructions for the rating of certain 
offense behaviors. However, especially mitigating or aggravating 
circumstances in a particular case may justify a decision or a severity 
rating different from that listed.
    (e) An evaluation sheet containing a ``salient factor score'' serves 
as an aid in determining the parole prognosis (potential risk of parole 
violation). However, where circumstances warrant, clinical evaluation of 
risk may override this predictive aid.
    (f) Guidelines for reparole consideration are set forth at Sec. 
2.21.
    (g) The Commission shall review the guidelines, including the 
salient factor score, periodically and may revise or modify them at any 
time as deemed appropriate.
    (h) If an offender was less than 18 years of age at the time of the 
current offense, such youthfulness shall, in itself, be considered as a 
mitigating factor.
    (i) For criminal behavior committed while in confinement see Sec. 
2.36 (Rescission Guidelines).
    (j)(1) In probation revocation cases, the original federal offense 
behavior and any new criminal conduct on probation (federal or 
otherwise) is considered in assessing offense severity. The original 
federal conviction is also counted in the salient factor score as a 
prior conviction. Credit is given toward the guidelines for any time 
spent in confinement on any offense considered in assessing offense 
severity.
    (2) Exception: Where probation has been revoked on a complex 
sentence (i.e., a committed sentence of more than six months on one 
count or more of an indictment or information followed by a probation 
term on other count(s) of an indictment or information), the case shall 
be considered for guideline purposes under Sec. 2.21 as if parole 
rather than probation had been revoked.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Note: For Category Eight, no upper limits are specified due to the
  extreme variability of the cases within this category. For decisions
  exceeding the lower limit of the applicable guideline category by more
  than 48 months, the Commission will specify the pertinent case factors
  upon which it relied in reaching its decision, which may include the
  absence of any factors mitigating the offense. This procedure is
  intended to ensure that the prisoner understands that individualized
  consideration has been given to the facts of the case, and not to
  suggest that a grant of parole is to be presumed for any class of
  Category Eight offenders. However, a murder committed to silence a
  victim or witness, a contract murder, a murder by torture, the murder
  of a law enforcement officer to carry out an offense, or a murder
  committed to further the aims of an on-going criminal operation, shall
  not justify a grant of parole at any point in the prisoner's sentence
  unless there are compelling circumstances in mitigation (e.g., a
  youthful offender who participated in a murder planned and executed by
  his parent). Such aggravated crimes are considered, by definition, at
  the extreme high end of Category Eight offenses. For these cases, the
  expiration of the sentence is deemed to be a decision at the maximum
  limit of the guideline range. (The fact that an offense does not fall
  under the definition contained herein does not mean that the
  Commission is obliged to grant a parole.)

if, an offense behavior cannot be graded by reference to Chapters One-
Eleven, the following formula may be used as a guide.

             Chapter Thirteen General Notes and Definitions

                       Subchapter A--General Notes

    1. If an offense behavior can be classified under more than one 
category, the most serious applicable category is to be used.
    2. If an offense behavior involved multiple separate offenses, the 
severity level may be increased. Exception: in cases graded as Category 
Seven, multiple separate offenses are to be taken into account by 
consideration of a decision above the guidelines rather than by 
increasing the severity level.
    (a) In certain instances, the guidelines specify how multiple 
offenses are to be rated. In offenses rated by monetary loss (e.g., 
theft and related offenses, counterfeiting, tax evasion) or drug 
offenses, the total amount of the property or drugs involved is used as 
the basis for the offense severity rating. In instances not specifically 
covered in the guidelines, the decision-makers must exercise discretion 
as to whether or not the multiple offense behavior is sufficiently 
aggravating to justify increasing the severity rating. The following 
chart is intended to provide guidance in assessing whether the severity 
of multiple offenses is sufficient to raise the offense severity level; 
it is not intended as a mechanical rule.

                       Multiple Separate Offenses
------------------------------------------------------------------------
             Severity               Points        Severity        Points
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Category One.....................    = 1/9  Category Five......      = 9
Category Two.....................    = 1/3  Category Six.......     = 27
Category Three...................      = 1  Category Seven.....     = 45
Category Four....................      = 3  ...................  .......
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Examples: 3 Category Five Offense [3x(9)=27]=Category Six, 5 Category 
          Five Offenses [5x(9)=45]=Category Seven, 2 Category Six 
          Offenses [2x(27)=54]=Category Seven

    (b) The term `multiple separate offenses' generally refers to 
offenses committed at different times. However, there are certain 
circumstances in which offenses committed at the same time are properly 
considered multiple separate offenses for the purpose of establishing 
the offense severity rating. These include (1) unrelated offenses, and 
(2) offenses involving the unlawful possession of weapons during 
commission of another offense.
    (c) For offenses graded according to monetary value (e.g., theft) 
and drug offenses, the severity rating is based on the amount or 
quantity involved and not on the number of separate instances.
    (d) Intervening Arrests. Where offenses ordinarily graded by 
aggregation of value/quantity (e.g., property or drug offenses) are 
separated by an intervening arrest, grade (1) by aggregation of value/
quantity or (2) as multiple separate offenses, whichever results in a 
higher severity category.
    (e) Income Tax Violations Related to Other Criminal Activity. Where 
the circumstances indicate that the offender's income tax violations are 
related to failure to report income from other criminal activity (e.g., 
failure to report income from a fraud offense) grade as tax evasion or 
according to the underlying criminal activity established, whichever is 
higher. Do not grade as multiple separate offenses.
    3. In cases where multiple sentences have been imposed (whether 
consecutive or concurrent, and whether aggregated or not) an offense 
severity rating shall be established to reflect the overall severity of 
the underlying criminal behavior. This rating shall apply whether or not 
any of the component sentences have expired.
    4. The prisoner is to be held accountable for his own actions and 
actions done in concert with others; however, the prisoner is not to be 
held accountable for activities committed by associates over which the 
prisoner has no control and could not have been reasonably expected to 
foresee. However, if the prisoner has been convicted of a conspiracy, he 
must be held accountable for the criminal

[[Page 125]]

activities committed by his co-conspirators, provided such activities 
were committed in furtherance of the conspiracy and subsequent to the 
date the prisoner joined the conspiracy, except in the case of an 
independent, small-scale operator whose role in the conspiracy was 
neither established nor significant. An offender has an ``established'' 
role in a conspiracy if, for example, he takes orders to perform a 
function that assists others to further the objectives of the 
conspiracy, even if his activities did not significantly contribute to 
those objectives. For such offenders, however, a ``peripheral role'' 
reduction may be considered.
    5. The following are examples of circumstances that may be 
considered as aggravating factors: extreme cruelty or brutality to a 
victim; the degree of permanence or likely permanence of serious bodily 
injury resulting from the offender's conduct; an offender's conduct 
while attempting to evade arrest that causes circumstances creating a 
significant risk of harm to other persons (e.g., causing a high speed 
chase or provoking the legitimate firing of a weapon by law enforcement 
officers).
    6. The phrase ``may be considered an aggravating/mitigating factor'' 
is used in this index to provide guidance concerning certain 
circumstances which may warrant a decision above or below the 
guidelines. This does not restrict consideration of above or below 
guidelines decisions only to these circumstances, nor does it mean that 
a decision above or below the guidelines is mandated in every such case.

                        Subchapter B--Definitions

    1. ``Accessory after the fact'' refers to the conduct of one who, 
knowing an offense has been committed, assists the offender to avoid 
apprehension, trial, or punishment (e.g., by assisting in disposal of 
the proceeds of an offense).
    Note: Where the conduct consists of concealing an offense by making 
false statements not under oath, grade as ``misprision of felony''. 
Where the conduct consists of haboring a fugitive, grade as ``harboring 
a fugitive''.
    2. ``Assassination kit'' refers to a disguised weapon designed to 
kill without attracting attention. Unlike other weapons such as sawed-
off shotguns which can be used to intimidate, assassination kits are 
intended to be undetectable in order to make the victim and bystanders 
unaware of the threat. A typical assassination kit is usually, but not 
always, a firearm with a silencer concealed in a briefcase or similar 
disguise and fired without showing the weapon.
    3. ``Bodily injury'' refers to injury of a type normally requiring 
medical attention [e.g., broken bone(s), laceration(s) requiring 
stitches, severe bruises].
    4. ``Carnal knowledge'' refers to sexual intercourse with a female 
who is less than 16 years of age and is not the wife of the offender.
    5. ``Extortionate extension of credit'' refers to any extension of 
credit with respect to which it is the understanding of the creditor and 
the debtor at the time it is made that delay in making repayment or 
failure to make repayment could result in the use of violence or other 
criminal means to cause harm to the person, reputation, or property of 
any person.
    6. ``Failure to appear'' refers to the violation of court imposed 
conditions of release pending trial, appeal, or imposition or execution 
of sentence by failure to appear before the court or to surrender for 
service of sentence.
    7. ``Forcible felony'' includes, but shall not be limited to, 
kidnapping, rape or sodomy, aircraft piracy or interference with a 
flight crew, arson or property destruction offenses, escape, robbery, 
extortion, or criminal entry offenses, and attempts to commit such 
offenses.
    8. ``Involuntary manslaughter'' refers to the unlawful killing of a 
human being without malice in the commission of an unlawful act not 
amounting to a felony, or in the commission in a unlawful manner, or 
without due caution and circumspection, of a lawful act which might 
produce death.
    9. ``Misprision of felony'' refers to the conduct of one who, having 
knowledge of the actual commission of a felony, conceals and does not as 
soon as possible make known the same to some judge or other person in 
civil or military authority. The ``concealment'' described above 
requires an act of commission (e.g., making a false statement to a law 
enforcement officer).
    10. ``Murder'' refers to the unlawful killing of a human being with 
malice aforethought. ``With malice aforethought'' generally refers to a 
finding that the offender formed an intent to kill or do serious bodily 
harm to the victim without just cause or provocation.
    11. ``Opiate'' includes heroin, morphine, opiate derivatives, and 
synthetic opiate substitutes.
    12. ``Other illicit drug offenses'' include, but are not limited to, 
offenses involving the following: amphetamines, hallucinogens, 
barbiturates, methamphetamines, and phencyclidine (PCP).
    13. ``Other medium of exchange'' includes, but is not limited to, 
postage stamps, governmental money orders, or governmental coupons 
redeemable for cash or goods.
    14. ``Peripheral role'' in drug offenses refers to conduct such as 
that of a person hired as a deckhand on a marijuana boat, a person hired 
to help offload marijuana, a person with no special skills hired as a 
simple courier of drugs on a commercial airline flight, or a person 
hired as a chauffeur in a drug

[[Page 126]]

transaction. This definition does not include persons with decision-
making or supervisory authority, persons with relevant special skills 
(e.g., a boat captain, chemist, or airplane pilot), or persons who 
finance such operations. Individuals who transport unusually large 
amounts of drugs (e.g., 50 kilos of cocaine or more) or who otherwise 
appear to have a high degree of trust, professionalism, or control will 
be considered to be ``transporters'' and not ``simple couriers.''
    15. ``Protected person'' refers to a person listed in 18 U.S.C. 351 
(relating to Members of Congress), 1116 (relating to foreign officials, 
official guests, and internationally protected persons), or 1751 
(relating to presidential assassination and officials in line of 
succession).
    16. ``Serious bodily injury'' refers to injury creating a 
substantial risk of death, major disability or loss of a bodily 
function, or disfigurement.
    17. ``Serious bodily injury is the result intended'' refers to a 
limited category of offense behaviors where the circumstances indicate 
that the bodily injury intended was serious (e.g., throwing acid in a 
person's face, or firing a weapon at a person) but where it is not 
established that murder was the intended object. Where the circumstances 
establish that murder was the intended object, grade as an `attempt to 
murder'.
    18. ``Sexual exploitation of children'' refers to employing, using, 
inducing, enticing, or coercing a person less than 18 years of age to 
engage in any sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a 
visual or print medium depicting such conduct with knowledge or reason 
to know that such visual or print medium will be distributed for sale, 
transported in interstate or foreign commerce, or mailed. It also 
includes knowingly transporting, shipping, or receiving such visual or 
print medium for the purposes of distributing for sale, or knowingly 
distribution for sale such visual or print medium.
    19. ``Trafficking in stolen property'' refers to receiving stolen 
property with intent to sell.
    20. The ``value of the property'' is determined by estimating the 
actual or potential replacement cost to the victim. The ``actual 
replacement cost'' is the value or money permanently lost to the victim 
through theft/forgery/fraud. The ``potential replacement cost'' refers 
to the total loss the offender specifically intended to cause by theft/
forgery/fraud, or the total amount of the victim's money or property 
unlawfully exposed to risk of loss through theft/forgery/fraud 
notwithstanding subsequent recovery by the victim. The highest of these 
three values is the value to be used in rating the offense on the 
guidelines.
    21. ``Voluntary manslaughter'' refers to the unlawful killing of a 
human being without malice upon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion.''

                      SALIENT FACTOR SCORING MANUAL

    The following instructions serve as a guide in computing the salient 
factor score.

ITEM A. PRIOR CONVICTIONS/ADJUDICATIONS (ADULT OR JUVENILE) [[None = 3; 
          One = 2; Two or three = 1; Four or more. . . . = 0]]

    A.1 In General.
    (a) Count all convictions/adjudications (adult or juvenile) for 
criminal offenses (other than the current offense) that were committed 
prior to the present period of confinement, except as specifically 
noted.
    (b) Convictions for prior offenses that are not separated from each 
other by an intervening arrest (e.g., two burglaries followed by an 
arrest for both offenses) are counted as a single prior conviction. 
Prior offenses that are separated by an intervening arrest are counted 
separately (e.g., three convictions for larceny and a conviction for an 
additional larceny committed after the arrest for the first three 
larcenies would be counted as two prior convictions, even if all the 
four offenses were adjudicated together).
    (c) Do not count the current federal offense or state/local 
convictions resulting from the current federal offense ((i.e., offenses 
that are considered in assessing the severity of the current offense). 
Exception: Where the first and last overt acts of the current offense 
behavior are separated by an intervening federal conviction (e.g., after 
conviction for the current federal offense, the offender commits another 
federal offense while on appeal bond), both offenses are counted in 
assessing offense severity; the earlier offense is also counted as a 
prior conviction in the salient factor score.
    A.2 Convictions. (a) Felony convictions are counted. Non-felony 
convictions are counted, except as listed under (b) and (c). Convictions 
for driving while intoxicated/while under the influence/while impaired, 
or leaving the scene of an accident involving injury or an attended 
vehicle are counted. For the purpose of scoring Item A of the salient 
factor score, use the offense of conviction.
    (b) Convictions for the following offenses are counted only if the 
sentence resulting was a commitment of more than thirty days (as defined 
in item B) or probation of one year or more (as defined in Item E), or 
if the record indicates that the offense was classified by the 
jurisdiction as a felony (regardless of sentence):
    1. Contempt of court;
    2. Disorderly conduct/disorderly person/breach of the peace/
disturbing the peace/uttering loud and abusive language;
    3. Driving without a license/with a revoked or suspended license/
with a false license;
    4. False information to a police officer;

[[Page 127]]

    5. Fish and game violations;
    6. Gambling (e.g., betting on dice, sports, cards) [Note: Operation 
or promotion of or employment in an unlawful gambling business is not 
included herein];
    7. Loitering;
    8. Non-support;
    9. Prostitution;
    10. Resisting arrest/evade and elude;
    11. Trespassing;
    12. Reckless driving;
    13. Hindering/failure to obey a police officer;
    14. Leaving the scene of an accident (except as listed under (a)).
    (c) Convictions for certain minor offenses are not counted, 
regardless of sentence. These include:
    1. Hitchhiking;
    2. Local regulatory violations;
    3. Public intoxication/possession of alcohol by a minor/possession 
of alcohol in an open container;
    4. Traffic violations (except as specifically listed);
    5. Vagrancy/vagabond and rogue;
    6. Civil contempt.
    A.3 Juvenile Conduct. Count juvenile convictions/adjudications 
except as follows:
    (a) Do not count any status offense (e.g., runaway, truancy, 
habitual disobedience) unless the behavior included a criminal offense 
which would otherwise be counted;
    (b) Do not count any criminal offense committed at age 15 or less, 
unless it resulted in a commitment of more than 30 days.
    A.4 Military Conduct. Count military convictions by general or 
special court-martial (not summary court-martial or Article 15 
disciplinary proceeding) for acts that are generally prohibited by 
civilian criminal law (e.g., assault, theft). Do not count convictions 
for strictly military offenses. Note: This does not preclude 
consideration of serious or repeated military misconduct as a negative 
indicant of parole prognosis (i.e., a possible reason for overriding the 
salient factor score in relation to this item).
    A.5 Diversion. Conduct resulting in diversion from the judicial 
process without a finding of guilt (e.g., deferred prosecution, 
probation without plea, or a District of Columbia juvenile consent 
decree) is not to be counted in scoring this item. However, an instance 
of criminal behavior resulting in a judicial determination of guilt or 
an admission of guilt before a judicial body shall be counted as a 
conviction even if a conviction is not formally entered.
    A.6 Setting Aside of Convictions/Restoration of Civil Rights Setting 
aside or removal of juvenile convictions/adjudications is normally for 
civil purposes (to remove civil penalties and stigma). Such convictions/
adjudications are to be counted for purposes of assessing parole 
prognosis. This also applies to adult convictions/adjudications which 
may be set aside by various methods (including pardon). However, 
convictions/adjudications that were set aside or pardoned on grounds of 
innocence are not to be counted.
    A.7 Convictions Reversed or Vacated on Grounds of Constitutional or 
Procedural Error. Exclude any conviction reversed or vacated for 
constitutional or procedural grounds, unless the prisoner has been 
retried and reconvicted. It is the Commission's presumption that a 
conviction/adjudication is valid, except under the limited circumstances 
described in the first note below. If a prisoner challenges such 
conviction he/she should be advised to petition for a reversal of such 
conviction in the court in which he/she was originally tried, and then 
to provide the Commission with evidence of such reversal. Note: 
Occasionally the presentence report documents facts clearly indicating 
that a conviction was unconstitutional for deprivation of counsel [this 
occurs only when the conviction was for a felony, or for a lesser 
offense for which imprisonment was actually imposed; and the record is 
clear that the defendant (1) was indigent, and (2) was not provided 
counsel, and (3) did not waive counsel]. In such case, do not count the 
conviction. Similarly, do not count a conviction if: (1) the offender 
has petitioned the appropriate court to overturn a felony conviction 
that occurred prior to 1964, or a misdemeanor/petty offense conviction 
that occurred prior to 1973 (and the offender claims he served a jail 
sentence for the non-felony conviction); (2) the offender asserts he was 
denied his right to counsel in the prior conviction; and (3) the 
offender provides evidence (e.g., a letter from the court clerk) that 
the records of the prior conviction are unavailable. Note: If a 
conviction found to be invalid is nonetheless supported by persuasive 
information that the offender committed the criminal act, this 
information may be considered as a negative indicant of parole prognosis 
(i.e., a possible reason for overriding the salient factor score).
    A.8 Ancient Prior Record. If both of the following conditions are 
met: (1) The offender's only countable convictions under Item A occurred 
at least ten years prior to the commencement of the current offense 
behavior (the date of the last countable conviction under Item A refers 
to the date of the conviction, itself, not the date of the offense 
leading to conviction), and (2) there is at least a ten year commitment 
free period in the community (including time on probation or parole) 
between the last release from a countable commitment (under Item B) and 
the commencement of the current offense behavior; then convictions/
commitments prior to the above ten year period are not to be counted for 
purposes of Item A, B, or C. Note: This provision does not preclude 
consideration of earlier behavior (e.g., repetition of particularly 
serious or assaultive conduct) as

[[Page 128]]

a negative indicant of parole prognosis (i.e., a possible reason for 
overriding the salient factor score). Similarly, a substantial crime 
free period in the community, not amounting to ten years, may, in light 
of other factors, indicate that the offender belongs in a better risk 
category than the salient factor score indicates.
    A.9 Foreign Convictions. Foreign convictions (for behavior that 
would be criminal in the United States) are counted.
    A.10 Tribal Court Convictions. Tribal court convictions are counted 
under the same terms and conditions as any other conviction.
    A.11 Forfeiture of Collateral. If the only known disposition is 
forfeiture of collateral, count as a conviction (if a conviction for 
such offense would otherwise be counted).
    A.12 Conditional/Unconditional Discharge (New York State). In N.Y. 
State, the term ``conditional discharge'' refers to a conviction with a 
suspended sentence and unsupervised probation; the term ``unconditional 
discharge'' refers to a conviction with a suspended sentence. Thus, such 
N.Y. State dispositions for countable offenses are counted as 
convictions.
    A.13 Adjudication Withheld (Florida). In Florida, the term 
``adjudication withheld'' refers to a disposition in which a formal 
conviction is not entered at the time of sentencing, the purpose of 
which is to allow the defendant to retain his civil rights and not to be 
classified as a convicted felon. Since the disposition of adjudication 
withheld is characterized by an admission of guilt and/or a finding of 
guilt before a judicial body, dispositions of ``adjudication withheld'' 
are to be counted as convictions for salient factor scoring purposes. 
However, it is not considered a conviction on which forfeiture of street 
time can be based.
    A.14 Juvenile Consent Decree (District of Columbia). A juvenile 
consent decree in the District of Columbia is a diversionary disposition 
not requiring an admission or finding of guilt. Therefore, it is not to 
be used in scoring this item.

ITEM B. PRIOR COMMITMENTS OF MORE THAN THIRTY DAYS (ADULT OR JUVENILE) 
          [[None=-2; One or two=1; Three or more=0]]

    B.1 Count all prior commitments of more than thirty days (adult or 
juvenile) resulting from a conviction/adjudication listed under Item A, 
except as noted below. Also count commitments of more than thirty days 
imposed upon revocation of probation or parole where the original 
probation or parole resulted from a conviction/adjudication counted 
under Item A.
    B.2 Count only commitments that were imposed prior to the commission 
of the last overt act of the current offense behavior. Commitments 
imposed after the current offense are not counted for purposes of this 
item. Concurrent or consecutive sentences (whether imposed as the same 
time or at different times) that result in a continuous period of 
confinement count as a single commitment. However, a new court 
commitment of more than thirty days imposed for an escape/attempted 
escape or for criminal behavior committed while in confinement/escape 
status counts as a separate commitment.
    B.3 Definitions. (a) This item only includes commitments that were 
actually imposed. Do not count a suspended sentence as a commitment. Do 
not count confinement pending trial or sentencing or for study and 
observation as a commitment unless the sentence is specifically to 
``time served''. If a sentence imposed is subsequently reconsidered and 
reduced, do not count as a commitment if it is determined that the total 
time served, including jail time, was 30 days or less. Count a sentence 
to intermittent confinement (e.g., weekends) totaling more than 30 days.
    (b) This item includes confinement in adult or juvenile 
institutions, community corrections centers, and other residential 
treatment centers (e.g., halfway houses and community treatment 
centers). It does not include foster home placement. Count confinement 
in a community corrections center (CCC) or other residential treatment 
center only when it is part of a committed sentence. Do not count 
confinement in a community corrections center or other residential 
treatment center when imposed as a condition of probation or parole. Do 
not count self-commitment for drug or alcohol treatment.
    (c) If a committed sentence of more than 30 days is imposed prior to 
the current offense but the offender avoids or delays service of the 
sentence (e.g., by absconding, escaping, bail pending appeal), count as 
a prior commitment. Note: Where the subject unlawfully avoids service of 
a prior commitment by escaping or failing to appear for service of 
sentence, this commitment is also to be considered in Items D and E. 
Example: An offender is sentenced to a three-year prison term, released 
on appeal bond, and commits the current offense. Count as a previous 
commitment under Item B, but not under Items D and E. To be considered 
under Items D and E, the avoidance of sentence must have been unlawful 
(e.g., escape or failure to report for service of sentence). Example: An 
offender is sentenced to a three-year prison term, escapes, and commits 
the current offense. Count as a previous commitment under Items B, D, 
and E.
    (d) District of Columbia Juvenile Commitment to Department of Human 
Services. In the District of Columbia, juvenile offenders may be 
committed to the Department of Human Services for placement ranging from 
a foster home to a secure juvenile facility. Such a commitment is 
counted only if it can

[[Page 129]]

be established that the juvenile was actually committed for more than 30 
days to a secure juvenile institution or residential treatment center 
rather than a foster home.

ITEM C. AGE AT COMMENCEMENT OF THE CURRENT OFFENSE/PRIOR COMMITMENTS OF 
          MORE THAN THIRTY DAYS (ADULT OR JUVENILE)

    C.1 Score 3 if the subject was 26 years of age or more at the 
commencement of the current offense and has three or fewer prior 
commitments.
    C.2 Score 2 if the subject was 26 years of age or more at the 
commencement of the current offense and has four prior commitments.
    C.3 Score 1 if the subject was 26 years of age or more at the 
commencement of the current offense and has five or more prior 
commitments.
    C.4 Score 2 if the subject was 22-25 years of age at the 
commencement of the current offense and has three or fewer prior 
commitments.
    C.5 Score 1 if the subject was 22-25 years of age at the 
commencement of the current offense and has four prior commitments.
    C.6 Score 0 if the subject was 22-25 years of age at the 
commencement of the current offense and has five or more prior 
commitments.
    C.7 Score 1 if the subject was 20-21 years of age at the 
commencement of the current offense and has three or fewer prior 
commitments.
    C.8 Score 0 if the subject was 20-21 years of age at the 
commencement of the current offense and has four prior commitments.
    C.9 Score 0 if the subject was 19 years of age or less at the 
commencement of the current offense with any number of prior 
commitments.
    C.10 Definitions (a) Use the age of the commencement of the 
subject's current offense behavior, except as noted under the special 
instructions for probation/parole/confinement/escape status violators.
    (b) Prior commitment is defined under Item B.

ITEM D. RECENT COMMITMENT FREE PERIOD (THREE YEARS)

    D.1 Score 1 if the subject has no prior commitments; or if the 
subject was released to the community from his/her last prior commitment 
at least three years prior to commencement of his/her current offense 
behavior.
    D.2 Score 0 if the subject's last release to the community from a 
prior commitment occurred less than three years prior to the current 
offense behavior; or if the subject was in confinement/escape status at 
the time of the current offense.
    D.3 Definitions. (a) Prior commitment is defined under Item B.
    (b) Confinement/escape status is defined under Item E.
    (c) Release to the community means release from confinement status 
(e.g., a person paroled through a CTC is released to the community when 
released from the CTC, not when placed in the CTC).

ITEM E. PROBATION/PAROLE/CONFINEMENT/ESCAPE STATUS VIOLATOR THIS TIME

    E.1 Score 1 if the subject was not on probation or parole, nor in 
confinement or escape status at the time of the current offense 
behavior; and was not committed as a probation, parole, confinement, or 
escape status violator this time.
    E.2 Score 0 if the subject was on probation or parole or in 
confinement or escape status at the time of the current offense 
behavior; or if the subject was committed as a probation, parole, 
confinement, or escape status violator this time.
    E.3 Definitions. (a) The term probation/parole refers to a period of 
federal, state, or local probation or parole supervision. Occasionally, 
a court disposition such as `summary probation' or `unsupervised 
probation' will be encountered. If it is clear that this disposition 
involved no attempt at supervision, it will not be counted for purposes 
of this item. Note: Unsupervised probation/parole due to deportation is 
counted in scoring this item.
    (b) The term ``parole'' includes parole, mandatory parole, 
supervised release, conditional release, or mandatory release 
supervision (i.e., any form of supervised release).
    (c) The term ``confinement/escape status'' includes institutional 
custody, work or study release, pass or furlough, community corrections 
center or other residential treatment center confinement (when such 
confinement is counted as a commitment under Item B), or escape from any 
of the above.

    Item F. Older Offenders.

    F.1 Score 1 if the offender was 41 years of age or more at the 
commencement of the current offense and the total score from Items A-E 
is 9 or less.
    F.2 Score 0 if the offender was less than 41 years of age at the 
commencement of the current offense or if the total score from Items A-E 
is 10.

           Special Instructions--Probation Violator This Time

Item A Count the original conviction that led to the sentence of 
probation as a prior conviction. Do not count the probation revocation 
as a prior conviction.
    Item B Count all prior commitments of more than thirty days which 
were imposed prior to the behavior resulting in the current probation 
revocation. If the subject is committed as a probation violator 
following a `split sentence' for which more than thirty

[[Page 130]]

days were served, count the confinement portion of the `split sentence' 
as a prior commitment. Note: The prisoner is still credited with the 
time served toward the current commitment.
    Item C Use the age at commencement of the probation violation, not 
the original offense.
    Item D Count backwards three years from the commencement of the 
probation violation.
    Item E By definition, no point is credited for this item. Exception: 
A person placed on unsupervised probation (other than for deportation) 
would not lose credit for this item.
    Item F Use the age at commencement of the probation violation, not 
the original offense.

  Special Instructions--Parole or Supervised Release Violator This Time

    Item A The conviction from which paroled or placed on supervised 
release counts as a prior conviction.
    Item B The commitment from which paroled or released to supervised 
release (including a prison term ordered for a prior supervised release 
revocation), counts as a prior commitment.
    Item C Use the age at commencement of the violation behavior 
(including new criminal behavior).
    Item D Count backwards three years from the commencement of the 
violation behavior (including new criminal behavior).
    Item E By definition, no point is credited for this item.
    Item F Use the age at commencement of the violation behavior 
(including new criminal behavior).

   Special Instructions--Confinement/Escape Status Violator With New 
              Criminal Behavior in the Community This Time

    Item A The conviction being served at the time of the confinement/
escape status violation counts as a prior conviction.
    Item B The commitment being served at the time of the confinement/
escape status violation counts as a prior commitment.
    Item C Use the age at commencement of the confinement/escape status 
violation.
    Item D By definition, no point is credited for this item.
    Item E By definition, no point is credited for this item.
    Item F Use the age at commencement of the confinement/escape status 
violation.

Sec. 2.21  Reparole consideration guidelines.

    (a)(1) If revocation is based upon administrative violation(s) only, 
grade the behavior as if a Category One offense under Sec. 2.20.
    (2) If a finding is made that the prisoner has engaged in behavior 
constituting new criminal conduct, the appropriate severity rating for 
the new criminal behavior shall be calculated. New criminal conduct may 
be determined either by a new federal, state, or local conviction or by 
an independent finding by the Commission at revocation hearing. As 
violations may be for state or local offenses, the appropriate severity 
level may be determined by analogy with listed federal offense 
behaviors.
    (b) The guidelines for parole consideration specified at 28 CFR 2.20 
shall then be applied with the salient factor score recalculated. The 
conviction and commitment from which the offender was released shall be 
counted as a prior conviction and commitment.
    (c) Time served on a new state or federal sentence shall be counted 
as time in custody for reparole guideline purposes. This does not affect 
the computation of the expiration date of the violator term as provided 
by Sec. Sec. 2.47(e) and 2.52 (c) and (d).
    (d) The above are merely guidelines. A decision outside these 
guidelines (either above or below) may be made when circumstances 
warrant.

Sec. 2.23  Delegation to hearing examiners.

    (a) There is hereby delegated to hearing examiners the authority 
necessary to conduct hearings and to make recommendations relative to 
the grant or denial of parole or reparole, revocation or reinstatement 
of parole or mandatory release, and conditions of parole. Any hearing 
may be conducted by a single examiner or by a panel of examiners. A 
Executive Hearing Examiner shall function as a hearing examiner for the 
purpose of obtaining a panel recommendation whenever the Regional 
Commissioner has not ordered that a hearing be conducted by a panel of 
two examiners. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. Sec. 2.48 through 
2.51, Sec. Sec. 2.101 through 2.104, and Sec. Sec. 2.214 through 
2.217, there is also delegated to hearing examiners the authority 
necessary to make a probable cause finding, to determine the location of 
a revocation hearing, and to determine the witnesses who will attend the 
hearing, including the authority to issue subpoenas for witnesses and 
evidence.
    (b) The concurrence of two hearing examiners, or of a hearing 
examiner and the Executive Hearing Examiner, shall be required to obtain 
a panel recommendation to the Regional Commissioner. A panel 
recommendation is required in each case decided by a Regional 
Commissioner after the holding of a hearing.
    (c) An examiner panel recommendation consists of two concurring 
examiner votes. In the event of divergent votes, the case shall be 
referred to another hearing examiner (or to the Executive Hearing 
Examiner in the case of a hearing conducted by a panel of examiners) for 
another vote. If concurring votes do not result from such a referral, 
the case shall be referred to any available hearing examiner until a 
panel recommendation is obtained.
    (d) A recommendation of a hearing examiner panel shall become an 
effective Commission decision only upon the Regional Commissioner's 
approval, and docketing at the regional office.

Sec. 2.24  Review of panel recommendation by the Regional Commissioner.

    (a) Upon review of the examiner panel recommendation, the Regional 
Commissioner may make the decision by concurring with the panel 
recommendation. If the Regional Commissioner does not concur, the 
Regional Commissioner shall refer the case to another Commissioner and 
the decision shall be made on the concurring votes of two Commissioners.
    (b) Upon review of the panel recommendation, the Regional 
Commissioner may also:
    (1) Designate the case for the original jurisdiction of the 
Commission pursuant to Sec. 2.17, vote on the case, and then refer the 
case to another Commissioner for further review; or
    (2) Remand the case for a rehearing, with the notice of action 
specifying the purpose of the rehearing.

Sec. 2.26  Appeal to National Appeals Board.

    (a)(1) A prisoner or parolee may submit to the National Appeals 
Board a written appeal of any decision to grant (other than a decision 
to grant parole on the date of parole eligibility), rescind, deny, or 
revoke parole, except that any appeal of a Commission decision pursuant 
to Sec. 2.17 shall be submitted as a petition for reconsideration under 
Sec. 2.27.
    (2) The appeal must be filed on a form provided for that purpose 
within 30 days from the date of entry of the decision that is the 
subject of the appeal. The appeal must include an opening paragraph that 
briefly summarizes the grounds for the appeal. The appellant shall then 
list each ground separately and concisely explain the reasons supporting 
each ground. Appeals that do not conform to the above requirements may 
be returned at the Commission's

[[Page 132]]

discretion, in which case the appellant shall have 30 days from the date 
the appeal is returned to submit an appeal that complies with the above 
requirements. The appellant may provide any additional information for 
the Commission to consider in an addendum to the appeal. Exhibits may be 
attached to an appeal, but the appellant should not attach exhibits that 
are copies of documents already in the possession of the Commission. Any 
exhibits that are copies of documents already in the Commission's files 
will not be retained by the Commission.
    (b)(1) The National Appeals Board may: Affirm the decision of a 
Regional Commissioner on the vote of a single Commissioner other than 
the Commissioner who issued the decision from which the appeal is taken; 
or modify or reverse the decision of a Regional Commissioner, or order a 
new hearing, upon the concurrence of two Commissioners. The Commissioner 
first reviewing the case may in his discretion circulate the case for 
review and vote by the other Commissioners notwithstanding his own vote 
to affirm the Regional Commissioner's decision. In such event, the case 
shall be decided by the concurrence of two out of three votes.
    (2) All Commissioners serve as members of the National Appeals 
Board, and it shall in no case be an objection to a decision of the 
Board that the Commissioner who issued the decision from which an appeal 
is taken participated as a voting member on appeal.
    (c) The National Appeals Board shall act within sixty days of 
receipt of the appellant's papers, to affirm, modify, or reverse the 
decision. Decisions of the National Appeals Board shall be final.
    (d) If no appeal is filed within thirty days of the date of entry of 
the original decision, such decision shall stand as the final decision 
of the Commission.
    (e) Appeals under this section may be based upon the following 
grounds:
    (1) That the guidelines were incorrectly applied as to any or all of 
the following:
    (i) Severity rating;
    (ii) Salient factor score;
    (iii) Time in custody;
    (2) That a decision outside the guidelines was not supported by the 
reasons or facts as stated;
    (3) That especially mitigating circumstances (for example, facts 
relating to the severity of the offense or the prisoner's probability of 
success on parole) justify a different decision;
    (4) That a decision was based on erroneous information, and the 
actual facts justify a different decision;
    (5) That the Commission did not follow correct procedure in deciding 
the case, and a different decision would have resulted if the error had 
not occurred;
    (6) There was significant information in existence but not known at 
the time of the hearing;
    (7) There are compelling reasons why a more lenient decision should 
be rendered on grounds of compassion.
    (f) Upon the written request of the Attorney General seeking review 
of a decision of a Regional Commissioner, which is received within 30 
days of such decision, the National Appeals Board shall reaffirm, 
modify, or reverse the Regional Commissioner's decision within 60 days 
of receipt of the Attorney General's request. The National Appeals Board 
shall inform the Attorney General and the prisoner to whom the decision 
applies in writing of its decision and the reasons therefor. In the 
event the Attorney General submits new and significant information that 
has not previously been disclosed to the prisoner prior to a hearing 
under these rules, the National Appeals Board shall act within 60 days 
to reaffirm, modify or reverse the Regional Commissioner's decision, but 
shall also remand the case for a new hearing if its decision is adverse 
to the prisoner. The prisoner shall have disclosure of the new 
information, and the opportunity to dispute that information under Sec. 
2.19(c) of this part. Following the hearing, the case shall be returned 
to the National Appeals Board, together with a recommendation from the 
hearing examiner, to render a final Commission decision as to the 
disposition of the case.

Sec. 2.27  Petition for reconsideration of original jurisdiction decisions.

    (a) A petition for reconsideration may be filed with the Commission 
in a case decided under the procedure specified in Sec. 2.17 within 
thirty days of the date of such decision. A form is provided for this 
purpose. A petition for reconsideration will be reviewed at the next 
regularly scheduled meeting of the Commission provided the petition is 
received thirty days in advance of such meeting. A petition received by 
the Commission less than thirty days in advance of a regularly scheduled 
meeting will be reviewed at the next regularly scheduled meeting. The 
previous decision made under Sec. 2.17 may be modified or reversed only 
by a majority vote of the Commissioners holding office at the time of 
the review of the petition. If a majority vote is not obtained, the 
previous decision shall stand. A decision under this rule shall be 
final.
    (b) Attorneys, relatives, and other interested parties who wish to 
submit written information concerning a petition for reconsideration 
should send such information to the National Appeals Board, United 
States Parole Commission, 5550 Friendship Boulevard, Chevy Chase, 
Maryland 20815. Petitions and all supporting material are to be 
submitted thirty days in advance of the meeting at which such petitions 
will be considered.
    (c) If no petition for reconsideration is filed within 30 days of 
the entry of a decision under Sec. 2.17, that decision shall stand as 
the final decision of the Commission.

<R05>
Sec. 2.28  Reopening of cases.

    (a) Favorable information. Upon the receipt of new information of 
substantial significance favorable to the prisoner, the Regional 
Commissioner may reopen a case (including an original jurisdiction 
case), and order a special reconsideration hearing on the next available 
docket, or modify the previous decision. The advancement of a 
presumptive release date requires the concurrence of two Commissioners.
    (b) Institutional misconduct. Consideration of disciplinary 
infractions and allegations of new criminal conduct occurring after the 
setting of a parole date are subject to the provisions of Sec. 2.14 (in 
the case of a prisoner with a presumptive date) and Sec. 2.34 (in the 
case of a prisoner with an effective date of parole).
    (c) Additional sentences. If a prisoner receives an additional 
concurrent or consecutive federal sentence following his initial parole 
consideration, the Regional Commissioner shall reopen his case for a new 
initial hearing on the next regularly scheduled docket to consider the 
additional sentence and reevaluate the case. Such action shall void the 
previous presumptive or effective release date. However, a new initial 
hearing is not mandatory where the Commission has previously evaluated 
the new criminal behavior, which led to the additional federal sentence, 
at a rescission hearing under 28 CFR 2.34; except where the new sentence 
extends the mandatory release date for a prisoner previously continued 
to the expiration of his sentence.
    (d) Conviction after revocation. Upon receipt of information 
subsequent to the revocation hearing that a prisoner whose parole has 
been revoked has sustained a new conviction for conduct while on parole, 
the Regional Commissioner may reopen the case pursuant to Sec. 
2.52(c)(2) for a special reconsideration hearing on the next regularly 
scheduled docket to consider forfeiture of time spent on parole and such 
further action as may be appropriate. The entry of a new order shall 
void any presumptive or effective release date previously established.
    (e) Release planning. When an effective date of parole has been set 
by the Commission, release on that date shall be conditioned upon the 
completion of a satisfactory plan for parole supervision. The 
appropriate Regional Commissioner may on his own motion reconsider any 
case prior to release and may reopen and advance or retard an effective 
parole date for purposes of release planning. Retardation without a 
hearing may not exceed 120 days.

[[Page 134]]

    (f) New adverse information. Upon receipt of new and significant 
adverse information that is not covered by paragraphs (a) through (e) of 
this section, a Commissioner may refer the case to the National 
Commissioners with his recommendation and vote to schedule the case for 
a special reconsideration hearing. Such referral shall automatically 
retard the prisoner's scheduled release date until a final decision is 
reached in the case. The decision to schedule a case for a special 
reconsideration hearing shall be based on the concurrence of two 
Commissioner votes, including the vote of the referring Commissioner. 
The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures set 
forth in Sec. Sec. 2.12 and 2.13. The entry of a new order following 
such hearing shall void the previously established release date.

Sec. 2.29  Release on parole.

    (a) A grant of parole shall not be deemed to be operative until a 
certificate of parole has been delivered to the prisoner.
    (b) An effective date of parole shall not be set for a date more 
than nine months from the date of the hearing. Residence in a community 
corrections center as part of a parole release plan generally shall not 
exceed one hundred and twenty days.
    (c) When an effective date of parole falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or 
legal holiday, the Warden of the appropriate institution shall be 
authorized to release the prisoner on the first working day preceding 
such date.

Sec. 2.30  False information or new criminal conduct: Discovery after 

release.

    If evidence comes to the attention of the Commission after a 
prisoner's release that such prisoner has willfully provided false 
information or misrepresented information deemed significant to his 
application for parole or has engaged in any criminal conduct during the 
current sentence prior to the delivery of the parole certificate, the 
Regional Commissioner may reopen the case pursuant to the procedures of 
Sec. 2.28(f) and order the prisoner summoned or retaken for hearing 
pursuant to the procedures of Sec. Sec. 2.49 and 2.50, as applicable, 
to determine whether the order of parole should be cancelled.

Sec. 2.31  Parole to detainers: Statement of policy.

    (a) Where a detainer is lodged against a prisoner, the Commission 
may grant parole if the prisoner in other respects meets the criteria 
set forth in Sec. 2.18. The presence of a detainer is not in itself a 
valid reason for the denial of parole.
    (b) The Commission will cooperate in working out arrangements for 
concurrent supervision with other jurisdictions where it is feasible and 
where release on parole appears to be justified.


<R05>
Sec. 2.32  Parole to local or immigration detainers.

    (a) When a State or local detainer is outstanding against a prisoner 
whom the Commission wishes to parole, the Commission may order either of 
the following:
    (1) Parole to the actual physical custody of the detaining 
authorities only. In this event, release is not to be effected except to 
the detainer. When such a detainer is withdrawn, the prisoner is not to 
be released unless and until the Commission makes a new order of parole.
    (2) Parole to the actual physical custody of the detaining 
authorities or an approved plan. In this event, release is to be 
effected to the community if detaining officials withdraw the detainer 
or make no effort to assume custody of the prisoner, providing there is 
an acceptable plan for community supervision.
    (b) When the Commission wishes to parole a prisoner subject to a 
detainer filed by Federal immigration officials, the Commission shall 
order the following: Parole to the actual physical custody of the 
immigration authorities or an approved plan. In this event, release is 
to be effected regardless of whether immigration officials take the

[[Page 135]]

prisoner into custody, providing there is an acceptable plan for 
community supervision.
    (c) As used in this section ``parole to a detainer'' means release 
to the ``physical custody'' of the authorities who have lodged the 
detainer. Temporary detention in a jail in the county where the 
institution of confinement is located does not constitute release on 
parole to such detainer. If the authorities who lodged the detainer do 
not take the prisoner into custody for any reason, he shall be returned 
to the institution to await further order of the Commission.

<R05>
Sec. 2.33  Release plans.

    (a) A grant of parole is conditioned upon the approval of release 
plans by the Regional Commissioner. In general, the following factors 
are considered as elements in the prisoner's release plan:
    (1) Availability of legitimate employment and an approved residence 
for the prospective parolee; and
    (2) Availability of necessary aftercare for a parolee who is ill or 
who requires special care.
    (b) Generally, parolees will be released only to the place of their 
legal residence unless the Commission is satisfied that another place of 
residence will serve the public interest more effectively or will 
improve the probability of the applicant's readjustment.
    (c) Where the circumstances warrant, the Commission on its own 
motion, or upon recommendation of the probation officer, may require 
that an advisor who is a responsible, reputable, and law-abiding citizen 
living in or near the community in which the releasee will reside be 
available to the releasee. Such advisor shall serve under the direction 
of and in cooperation with the probation officer to whom the parolee is 
assigned.
    (d) When the prisoner has an unsatisfied fine or restitution order, 
a reasonable plan for payment [or performance of services, if so ordered 
by the court] shall, where feasible, be included in the parole release 
plan.

<R05>
Sec. 2.34  Rescission of parole.

    (a) When an effective date of parole has been set by the Commission, 
release on that date is conditioned upon continued satisfactory conduct 
by the prisoner. If a prisoner granted such a date has been found in 
violation of institution rules by a Discipline Hearing Officer or is 
alleged to have committed a new criminal act at any time prior to the 
delivery of the certificate of parole, the Regional Commissioner shall 
be advised promptly of such information. The prisoner shall not be 
released until the institution has been notified that no change has been 
made in the Commission's order to parole. Following receipt of such 
information, the Regional Commissioner may reopen the case and retard 
the parole date for up to 90 days without a hearing, or schedule a 
rescission hearing under this section on the next available docket at 
the institution or on the first docket following return to a federal 
institution from a community corrections center or a state or local 
halfway house.
    (b) Upon the ordering of a rescission hearing under this section, 
the prisoner shall be afforded written notice specifying the information 
to be considered at the hearing. The notice shall further state that the 
purpose of the hearing will be to decide whether rescission of the 
parole date is warranted based on the charges listed on the notice, and 
shall advise the prisoner of the procedural rights described below.
    (c) A hearing before a Discipline Hearing Officer resulting in a 
finding that the prisoner has committed a violation of disciplinary 
rules may be relied upon by the Commission as conclusive evidence of 
institutional misconduct. However, the prisoner will be afforded an 
opportunity to explain any mitigating circumstances, and to present 
documentary evidence in mitigation of the misconduct at the rescission 
hearing.
    (d) In the case of allegations of new criminal conduct committed 
prior to delivery of the parole certificate, the

[[Page 136]]

Commission may consider documentary evidence and/or written testimony 
presented by the prisoner, arresting authorities, or other persons.
    (e) The prisoner may be represented at a rescission hearing by a 
person of his choice. The function of the prisoner's representative 
shall be to offer a statement following the discussion of the charges 
with the prisoner, and to provide such additional information as the 
hearing examiner may require. However, the hearing examiner may limit or 
exclude any irrelevant or repetitious statement.
    (f) The evidence upon which the rescission hearing is to be 
conducted shall be disclosed to the prisoner upon request, subject to 
the exemptions set forth at Sec. 2.55. If the parole grant is 
rescinded, the Commission shall furnish to the prisoner a written 
statement of its findings and the evidence relied upon.

<R05>
Sec. 2.35  Mandatory release in the absence of parole.

    (a) A prisoner shall be mandatorily released by operation of law at 
the end of the sentence imposed by the court less such good time 
deductions as he may have earned through his behavior and efforts at the 
institution of confinement. If released pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 4164, such 
prisoner shall be released, as if on parole, under supervision until the 
expiration of the maximum term or terms for which he was sentenced less 
180 days. If released pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 4205(f), such prisoner shall 
remain under supervision until the expiration of the maximum term or 
terms for which he was sentenced. Insofar as possible, release plans 
shall be completed before the release of any such prisoner.
    (b) It is the Commission's interpretation of the statutory scheme 
for parole and good time that the only function of good time credits is 
to determine the point in a prisoner's sentence when, in the absence of 
parole, the prisoner is to be conditionally released on supervision, as 
described in subsection (a). Once an offender is conditionally released 
from imprisonment, either by parole or mandatory release, the good time 
earned during that period of imprisonment is of no further effect either 
to shorten the period of supervision or to shorten the period of 
imprisonment which the offender may be required to serve for violation 
of parole or mandatory release.
    (c) A prisoner committed under the Youth Corrections Act must be 
initially released conditionally under supervision not later than two 
years before the expiration of the term imposed by the court.
    (d) If the Commission orders a military prisoner who is under the 
Commission's jurisdiction for an offense committed after August 15, 2001 
continued to the expiration of his sentence (or otherwise does not grant 
parole), the Commission shall place such prisoner on mandatory 
supervision after release if the Commission determines that such 
supervision is appropriate to provide an orderly transition to civilian 
life for the prisoner and to protect the community into which such 
prisoner is released. The Commission shall presume that mandatory 
supervision is appropriate for all such prisoners unless case-specific 
factors indicate that supervision is inappropriate. A prisoner who is 
placed on mandatory supervision shall be deemed to be released as if on 
parole, and shall be subject to the conditions of release at Sec. 2.40 
until the expiration of the maximum term for which he was sentenced, 
unless the prisoner's sentence is terminated early by the appropriate 
military clemency board.

Sec. 2.36  Rescission guidelines.

    (a) The following guidelines shall apply to the sanctioning of 
disciplinary infractions or new criminal conduct committed by a prisoner 
during any period of confinement that is credited to his current 
sentence (whether before or after sentence is imposed), but prior to his 
release on parole; and by a parole violator during any period of 
confinement prior to or following the revocation of his parole (except 
when such period of confinement has resulted from

[[Page 137]]

initial parole to a detainer). These guidelines specify the customary 
time to be served for such behavior which shall be added to the time 
required by the original presumptive or effective date. Credit shall be 
given towards service of these guidelines for any time spent in custody 
on a new offense that has not been credited towards service of the 
original presumptive or effective date. If a new concurrent or 
consecutive sentence is imposed for such behavior, these guidelines 
shall also be applied at the initial hearing on such term.
    (1) Administrative rule infraction(s) (including alcohol abuse) 
normally can be adequately sanctioned by postponing a presumptive or 
effective date by 0-60 days per instance of misconduct, or by 0-8 months 
in the case of use or simple possession of illicit drugs or refusal to 
provide a urine sample. Escape or other new criminal conduct shall be 
considered in accordance with the guidelines set forth below.
    (2) Escape/new criminal behavior in a prison facility (including a 
community corrections center). The time required pursuant to the 
guidelines set forth in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section 
shall be added to the time required by the original presumptive or 
effective date.
    (i) Escape or attempted escape--(A) Escape or attempted escape, 
except as listed below--8-16 months.
    (B) If from non-secure custody with voluntary return in 6 days or 
less--<= 6 months.
    (C) If by fear or force applied to person(s), grade under (ii) but 
not less than Category Five.

    Notes: (1) If other criminal conduct is committed during the escape 
or during time spent in escape status, then time to be served for the 
escape/attempted escape shall be added to that assessed for the other 
new criminal conduct.
    (2) Time in escape status shall not be credited.
    (3) Voluntary return is defined as returning voluntarily to the 
facility or voluntarily turning one's self in to a law enforcement 
authority as an escapee (not in connection with an arrest on other 
charges).
    (4) Non-secure custody refers to custody with no significant 
physical restraint [e.g., walkaway from a work detail outside the 
security perimeter of an institution; failure to return to any 
institution from a pass or unescorted furlough; or escape by stealth 
from an institution with no physical perimeter barrier (usually a camp 
or community corrections center)].

    (ii) Other new criminal behavior in a prison facility.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Severity rating in the new criminal
       behavior (from Sec.  2.20)                Guideline range
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Category One.............................  <<=8 months.
Category Two.............................  <<=10 months.
Category Three...........................  12-16 months.
Category Four............................  20-26 months.
Category Five............................  36-48 months.
Category Six.............................  52-64 months.
Category Seven...........................  64-92 months.
Category Eight...........................  120+ months.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Note: Grade unlawful possession of a firearm or explosives in a 
prison facility, other than a community corrections center, as Category 
Six. Grade unlawful possession of a firearm in a community corrections 
center as Category Four. Grade unlawful possession of a dangerous weapon 
other than a firearm or explosives (e.g., a knife) in a prison facility 
or community corrections center as Category Three.

    (3) New criminal behavior in the community (e.g., while on pass, 
furlough, work release, or on escape). In such cases, the guidelines 
applicable to reparole violators under Sec. 2.21 shall be applied, 
using the new offense severity (from Sec. 2.20) and recalculated 
salient factor score (such score shall be recalculated as if the 
prisoner had been on parole at the time of the new criminal behavior). 
The time required pursuant to these guidelines shall be added to the 
time required by the original presumptive or effective date.

    Note: Offenses committed in a prison or in a community corrections 
center that are not limited to the confines of the prison or community 
corrections center (e.g., mail fraud of a victim outside the prison) are 
graded as new criminal behavior in the community.

    (b) The above are merely guidelines. Where the circumstances 
warrant, a decision outside the guidelines (above or below) may be 
rendered provided

[[Page 138]]

specific reasons are given. For example, a substantial period of good 
conduct since the last disciplinary infraction in cases not involving 
new criminal conduct may be treated as a mitigating circumstance.

Sec. 2.37  Disclosure of information concerning parolees; Statement of 

policy.

    (a) Information concerning a parolee under the Commission's 
supervision may be disclosed to a person or persons who may be exposed 
to harm through contact with that particular parolee if such disclosure 
is deemed to be reasonably necessary to give notice that such danger 
exists.
    (b) Information concerning parolees may be released by a Chief U.S. 
Probation Officer to a law enforcement agency (1) as deemed appropriate 
for the protection of the public or the enforcement of the conditions of 
parole or (2) pursuant to a request under 18 U.S.C. 4203(e).
    (c) Information deemed to be ``public sector'' information may be 
disclosed to third parties without the consent of the file subject. 
Public sector information encompasses the following:
    (1) Name;
    (2) Register number;
    (3) Offense of conviction;
    (4) Past and current places of incarceration;
    (5) Age;
    (6) Sentence data on the Bureau of Prisons sentence computation 
record (BP-5);
    (7) Date(s) of parole and parole revocation hearings; and
    (8) The decision(s) rendered by the Commission following a parole or 
parole revocation proceeding, including the dates of continuances and 
parole dates. An inmate's designated future place of incarceration is 
not public information.

Sec. 2.38  Community supervision by U.S. Probation Officers.

    (a) Pursuant to sections 3655 and 4203(b)(4) of title 18 of the U.S. 
Code, U.S. Probation Officers shall provide such parole services as the 
Commission may request. In conformity with the foregoing, probation 
officers function as parole officers and provide supervision to persons 
released by parole or as if on parole (mandatory release) under the 
Commission's jurisdiction.
    (b) A parolee may be transferred to a new district of supervision 
with the permission of the probation officers of both the transferring 
and receiving district, provided such transfer is not contrary to 
instructions from the Commission.

Sec. 2.39  Jurisdiction of the Commission.

    (a) Jurisdiction of the Commission over a parolee shall terminate no 
later than the date of expiration of the maximum term or terms for which 
he was sentenced, except as provided by Sec. 2.35, Sec. 2.43, or Sec. 
2.52.
    (b) The parole of any parolee shall run concurrently with the period 
of parole or probation under any other Federal, State, or local 
sentence.
    (c) Upon the termination of jurisdiction, the Commission shall issue 
a certificate of discharge to such parolee and to such other agencies as 
it may determine.

<R05>
Sec. 2.40  Conditions of release.

    (a) General conditions of release. (1) The conditions set forth in 
Sec. 2.204(a)(3)-(6) apply for the reasons set forth in Sec. 
2.204(a)(1). These conditions are printed on the certificate of release 
issued to each releasee.
    (2)(i) The refusal of a prisoner who has been granted a parole date 
to sign the certificate of release (or any other document necessary to 
fulfill a condition of release) constitutes withdrawal of that 
prisoner's application for parole as of the date of refusal. To be 
considered for parole again, that prisoner must reapply for parole 
consideration.
    (ii) A prisoner who is released to supervision through good-time 
deduction

[[Page 139]]

who refuses to sign the certificate of release is nevertheless bound by 
the conditions set forth in that certificate.
    (b) Special conditions of release. (1) The Commission may impose a 
condition other than one of the general conditions of release if the 
Commission determines that such condition is necessary to protect the 
public from further crimes by the releasee and to provide adequate 
supervision of the releasee. Examples of special conditions of release 
that the Commission frequently imposes are found at Sec. 2.204(b)(2).
    (2) If the Commission requires the releasee's participation in a 
drug-treatment program, the releasee must submit to a drug test before 
release and to at least two other drug tests, as determined by the 
supervision officer. A decision not to impose this special condition, 
because available information indicates a low risk of future substance 
abuse by the releasee, shall constitute good cause for suspension of the 
drug testing requirements of 18 U.S.C. 4209(a). A grant of parole or 
reparole is contingent upon the prisoner passing all pre-release drug 
tests administered by the Bureau of Prisons.
    (c) Changing conditions of release. The provisions of Sec. 2.204(c) 
apply.
    (d) Appeal. A releasee may appeal under Sec. 2.26 an order to 
impose or modify a release condition not later than 30 days after the 
date the condition is imposed or modified.
    (e) Application of release conditions to absconder. The provisions 
of Sec. 2.204(d) apply.
    (f) Revocation for possession of a controlled substance. If the 
Commission finds after a revocation hearing that a releasee, released 
after December 31, 1988, has possessed a controlled substance, the 
Commission shall revoke parole or mandatory release. If such a releasee 
fails a drug test, the Commission shall consider appropriate 
alternatives to revocation. The Commission shall not revoke parole on 
the basis of a single, unconfirmed positive drug test, if the releasee 
challenges the test result and there is no other violation found by the 
Commission to justify revocation.
    (g) Supervision officer guidance. The provisions of Sec. 2.204(f) 
apply.
    (h) Definitions. For purposes of this section--
    (1) The terms supervision officer, domestic violence crime, approved 
offender-rehabilitation program and firearm, as used in Sec. 2.204, 
have the meanings given those terms by Sec. 2.204(g);
    (2) The term releasee, as used in this section and in Sec. 2.204 
means a person convicted of a federal offense who has been released on 
parole or released through good-time deduction; and
    (3) The term certificate of release, as used in this section and 
Sec. 2.204, means the certificate of parole or mandatory release 
delivered to the prisoner under Sec. 2.29.

Sec. 2.41  Travel approval.

    (a) The probation officer may approve travel outside the district 
without approval of the Commission in the following situations:
    (1) Vacation trips not to exceed thirty days.
    (2) Trips, not to exceed thirty days, to investigate reasonably 
certain employment possibilities.
    (3) Recurring travel across a district boundary, not to exceed fifty 
miles outside the district, for purpose of employment, shopping, or 
recreation.
    (b) Specific advance approval by the Commission is required for all 
foreign travel, employment requiring recurring travel more than fifty 
miles outside the district (except employment at offshore locations), 
and vacation travel outside the district exceeding thirty days. A 
request for such permission shall be in writing and must demonstrate a 
substantial need for such travel.
    (c) A special condition imposed by the Regional Commissioner 
prohibiting certain travel shall supersede any general rules relating to 
travel as set forth above.

Sec. 2.43  Early termination.

    (a)(1) Upon its own motion or upon request of the parolee, the 
Commission may terminate supervision, and thus jurisdiction, over a 
parolee prior to the expiration of his maximum sentence.
    (2) A committed youth offender sentenced to a term of more than one 
year may not be granted an early termination of jurisdiction earlier 
than after one year of continuous supervision on parole. When 
termination of jurisdiction prior to the expiration of sentence is 
granted in the case of a youth offender, his conviction shall be 
automatically set aside. A certificate setting aside his conviction 
shall be issued in lieu of a certificate of termination.
    (b) Two years after release on supervision, and at least annually 
thereafter, the Commission shall review the status of each parolee to 
determine the need for continued supervision. In calculating such two-
year period there shall not be included any period of release on parole 
prior to the most recent release, nor any period served in confinement 
on any other sentence. A review will also be conducted whenever early 
termination is recommended by the supervising probation officer.
    (c)(1) Five years after release on supervision, the Commission shall 
terminate supervision over such parolee unless it is determined, after a 
hearing conducted in accordance with the procedures prescribed in 18 
U.S.C. 4214(a)(2), that such supervision should not be terminated 
because there is a likelihood that the parolee will engage in conduct 
violating any criminal law. Such hearing may be conducted by a hearing 
examiner or other official designated by the Regional Commissioner. In 
calculating such five-year period, there shall not be included any 
period of release on parole prior to the most recent release or any 
period served in confinement on any other sentence.
    (2) If supervision is not terminated under paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section the parolee may request a hearing annually thereafter, and a 
hearing shall be conducted with respect to termination of supervision 
not less frequently than biennially.
    (3) A parolee may appeal an adverse decision under paragraphs (c)(1) 
or (c)(2) of this section pursuant to Sec. 2.26 or Sec. 2.27 as 
applicable.
    (d) The Regional Commissioner shall have authority to make decisions 
under this section pursuant to the guidelines set forth below; except 
that in the case of a parolee classified under the provisions of Sec. 
2.17, an affirmative decision to terminate supervision under paragraph 
(b) of this section, or a decision to terminate or continue supervision 
under paragraph (c) of this section shall be made pursuant to the 
provisions of Sec. 2.17.
    (e) Early termination guidelines. In determining whether to grant 
early termination from supervision, the Commission shall apply the 
following guidelines:
    (1) Absent case-specific factors to the contrary, termination of 
supervision shall be considered indicated when:
    (i) A parolee originally classified in the very good risk category 
(pursuant to Sec. 2.20) has completed two continuous years of 
supervision free from any indication of new criminal behavior or serious 
parole violation; and
    (ii) A parolee originally classified in other than the very good 
risk category (pursuant to Sec. 2.20) has completed three continuous 
years of supervision free from any indication of new criminal behavior 
or serious parole violation.

    Note: As used in this section, an indication of new criminal 
behavior includes a new arrest if supported by substantial evidence of 
guilt, even if no conviction or parole revocation results.

    (2) Decisions to continue the parolee under supervision past the 
period indicated above may be made where case-specific factors justify a 
conclusion that continued supervision is needed to protect the public 
welfare. Such case-specific factors may relate to the current behavior 
of the parolee (for example, a parolee whose behavior begins to 
deteriorate as the normally expected time for termination approaches) or 
to the parolee's background (for example, a parolee with a history of 
repetitive assaultive conduct or substantial involvement in large scale 
or organized

[[Page 141]]

criminal activity). In such cases, an additional period of supervision 
prior to termination of jurisdiction may be warranted.
    (3) Decisions to terminate supervision prior to completion of the 
three year period specified in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section may 
be made where it appears that the parolee is a better risk than 
indicated by the salient factor score as originally calculated. However, 
termination of supervision prior to the completion of two years of 
difficulty-free supervision will not be granted unless case-specific 
factors clearly indicate that continued supervision would be 
counterproductive.
    (4) Cases with pending criminal charge(s) shall not be terminated 
from supervision until disposition of such charge(s) is known.
    (5) After five continuous years of supervision, decisions to 
terminate will be made in accordance with subsection (c) of this rule.

<R05>
Sec. 2.44  Summons to appear or warrant for retaking of parolee.

    (a) If a parolee is alleged to have violated the conditions of his 
release, and satisfactory evidence thereof is presented, the Commission 
or a member thereof may:
    (1) Issue a summons requiring the offender to appear for a 
preliminary interview or local revocation hearing.
    (2) Issue a warrant for the apprehension and return of the offender 
to custody.

A summons or warrant may be issued or withdrawn only by the Commission, 
or a member thereof.
    (b) Any summons or warrant under this section shall be issued as 
soon as practicable after the alleged violation is reported to the 
Commission, except when delay is deemed necessary. Issuance of a summons 
or warrant may be withheld until the frequency or seriousness of 
violations, in the opinion of the Commission, requires such issuance. In 
the case of any parolee charged with a criminal offense and awaiting 
disposition of the charge, issuance of a summons or warrant may be 
withheld, a warrant may be issued and held in abeyance, or a warrant may 
be issued and a detainer may be placed.
    (c) A summons or warrant may be issued only within the prisoner's 
maximum term or terms except that in the case of a prisoner released as 
if on parole pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 4164, such summons or warrant may be 
issued only within the maximum term or terms, less one hundred eighty 
days. A summons or warrant shall be considered issued when signed and 
either--
    (1) Placed in the mail or
    (2) Sent by electronic transmission to the intended authorities.
    (d) The issuance of a warrant under this section operates to bar the 
expiration of the parolee's sentence. Such warrant maintains the 
Commission's jurisdiction to retake the parolee either before or after 
the normal expiration date of the sentence and to reach a final decision 
as to revocation of parole and forfeiture of time pursuant to Sec. 
2.52(c).
    (e) A summons or warrant issued pursuant to this section shall be 
accompanied by a statement of the charges against the parolee, the 
applicable procedural rights under the Commission's regulations and the 
possible actions which may be taken by the Commission. A summons shall 
specify the time and place the parolee shall appear for a revocation 
hearing. Failure to appear in response to a summons shall be grounds for 
issuance of a warrant.

opinion that a youth offender will be benefited by further treatment in 
an institution or other facility, may direct his return to custody or

Sec. 2.46  Execution of warrant and service of summons.

    (a) Any officer of any Federal correctional institution or any 
Federal officer authorized to serve criminal process within the United 
States, to whom a warrant is delivered shall execute such warrant by 
taking the parolee and returning him to the custody of the Attorney 
General.
    (b) On arrest of the parolee the officer executing the warrant shall 
deliver to him a copy of the Warrant Application listing the charges 
against the parolee, the applicable procedural rights under the 
Commission's regulations and the possible actions which may be taken by 
the Commission.
    (c) If execution of the warrant is delayed pending disposition of 
local charges, for further investigation, or for some other purpose, the 
parolee is to be continued under supervision by the probation officer 
until the normal expiration of the sentence, or until the warrant is 
executed, whichever first occurs. Monthly supervision reports are to be 
submitted, and the parolee must continue to abide by all the conditions 
of release.
    (d) A summons to appear at a preliminary interview or revocation 
hearing shall be served upon the parolee in person by delivering to the 
parolee a copy of the summons. Service shall be made by any Federal 
officer authorized to serve criminal process within the United States, 
and certification of such service shall be returned to the appropriate 
regional office of the Commission.

Sec. 2.47  Warrant placed as a detainer and dispositional review.

    (a) When a parolee is serving a new sentence in a federal, state or 
local institution, a parole violation warrant may be placed against him 
as a detainer.
    (1) If the prisoner is serving a new sentence in a federal 
institution, a revocation hearing shall be scheduled within 120 days of 
notification of placement of the detainer, or as soon thereafter as 
practicable, provided the prisoner is eligible for and has applied for 
an initial hearing on the new sentence, or is serving a new sentence of 
one year or less. In any other case, the detainer shall be reviewed on 
the record pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (2) If the prisoner is serving a new sentence in a state or local 
institution, the violation warrant shall be reviewed by the Regional 
Commissioner not later than 180 days following notification to the 
Commission of such placement. The parolee shall receive notice of the 
pending review, and shall be permitted to submit a written application 
containing information relative to the disposition of the warrant. He 
shall also be notified of his right to request counsel under the 
provisions of Sec. 2.48(b) to assist him in completing this written 
application.
    (b) If the prisoner is serving a new federal sentence, the Regional 
Commissioner, following a dispositional record review, may:
    (1) Pursuant to the general policy of the Commission, let the 
warrant stand as a detainer and order that the revocation hearing be 
scheduled to coincide with the initial hearing on the new federal 
sentence or upon release from the new sentence, whichever comes first;
    (2) Withdraw the warrant, and either order reinstatement of the 
parolee to supervision upon release from confinement or close the case 
if the expiration date has passed.
    (c) If the prisoner is serving a new state or local sentence, the 
Regional Commissioner, following a dispositional record review may:
    (1) Withdraw the detainer and order reinstatement of the parolee to 
supervision upon release from custody, or close the case if the 
expiration date has passed.
    (2) Order a revocation hearing to be conducted by a hearing examiner 
or an official designated by the Regional Commissioner at the 
institution in which the parolee is confined.
    (3) Let the detainer stand and order further review at an 
appropriate time. If the warrant is not withdrawn and no revocation 
hearing is conducted while the prisoner is in state or local custody, an 
institutional revocation hearing shall be conducted after the prisoner's 
return to federal custody.

[[Page 143]]

    (d) Revocation hearings pursuant to this section shall be conducted 
in accordance with the provisions governing institutional revocation 
hearings, except that a hearing conducted at a state or local facility 
may be conducted by a hearing examiner, hearing examiner panel, or other 
official designated by the Regional Commissioner. Following a revocation 
hearing conducted pursuant to this section, the Commission may take any 
action specified in Sec. 2.52.
    (e)(1) A parole violator whose parole is revoked shall be given 
credit for all time in federal, state, or local confinement on a new 
offense for purposes of satisfaction of the reparole guidelines at Sec. 
2.20 and Sec. 2.21.
    (2) However, it shall be the policy of the Commission that the 
revoked parolee's original sentence (which due to the new conviction, 
stopped running upon his last release from federal confinement on 
parole) again start to run only upon release from the confinement 
portion of the new sentence or the date of reparole granted pursuant of 
these rules, whichever comes first. This subsection does not apply to 
cases where, by law, the running of the original sentence is not 
interrupted by a new conviction (e.g., YCA; NARA; Mexican or Canadian 
treaty cases).
    (f) If a Regional Commissioner determines that additional 
information is required in order to make a decision pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, he may schedule a dispositional 
hearing at the state or local institution where the parolee is confined 
to obtain such information. Such hearing may be conducted by a hearing 
examiner, hearing examiner panel, or other official designated by the 
Regional Commissioner. The parolee shall have notice of such hearing, be 
allowed to testify in his behalf, and have opportunity for counsel as 
provided in Sec. 2.48(b).

Sec. 2.48  Revocation: Preliminary interview.

    (a) Interviewing officer. A parolee who is retaken on a warrant 
issued by a Commissioner shall be given a preliminary interview by an 
official designated by the Regional Commissioner to enable the 
Commission to determine if there is probable cause to believe that the 
parolee has violated his parole as charged, and if so, whether a 
revocation hearing should be conducted. The official designated to 
conduct the preliminary interview may be a U.S. Probation Officer in the 
district where the prisoner is confined, provided he is not the officer 
who recommended that the warrant be issued.
    (b) Notice and opportunity to postpone interview. At the beginning 
of the preliminary interview, the interviewing officer shall ascertain 
that the Warrant Application has been given to the parolee as required 
by Sec. 2.46(b), and shall advise the parolee that he may have the 
preliminary interview postponed in order to obtain representation by an 
attorney or arrange for the attendance of witnesses. The parolee shall 
also be advised that if he cannot afford to retain an attorney he may 
apply to a U.S. District Court for appointment of counsel to represent 
him at the preliminary interview and the revocation hearing pursuant to 
18 U.S.C. 3006A. In addition, the parolee may request the Commission to 
obtain the presence of persons who have given information upon which 
revocation may be based. Such adverse witnesses shall be requested to 
attend the preliminary interview unless the parolee admits a violation 
or has been convicted of a new offense while on supervision or unless 
the interviewing officer finds good cause for their non-attendance. 
Pursuant to Sec. 2.51 a subpoena may issue for the appearance of 
adverse witnesses or the production of documents.
    (c) Review of the charges. At the preliminary interview, the 
interviewing officer shall review the violation charges with the 
parolee, apprise the parolee of the evidence which has been presented to 
the Commission, receive the statements of witnesses and documentary 
evidence on behalf of the parolee, and allow cross-examination of those 
witnesses in attendance. Disclosure of the evidence presented to the 
Commission shall be made pursuant to Sec. 2.50(d).
    (d) At the conclusion of the preliminary interview, the interviewing 
officer

[[Page 144]]

shall inform the parolee of his recommended decision as to whether there 
is probable cause to believe that the parolee has violated the 
conditions of his release, and shall submit to the Commission a digest 
of the interview together with his recommended decision.
    (1) If the interviewing officer's recommended decision is that no 
probable cause may be found to believe that the parolee has violated the 
conditions of his release, the responsible Regional Commissioner shall 
review such recommended decision and notify the parolee of his final 
decision concerning probable cause as expeditiously as possible 
following receipt of the interviewing officer's digest. A decision to 
release the parolee shall be implemented without delay.
    (2) If the interviewing officer's recommended decision is that 
probable cause may be found to believe that the parolee has violated a 
condition (or conditions) of his release, the responsible Regional 
Commissioner shall notify the parolee of his final decision concerning 
probable cause within 21 days of the date of the preliminary interview.
    (3) Notice to the parolee of any final decision of a Regional 
Commissioner finding probable cause and ordering a revocation hearing 
shall state the charges upon which probable cause has been found and the 
evidence relied upon.
    (e) Release notwithstanding probable cause. If the Commission finds 
probable cause to believe that the parolee has violated the conditions 
of his release, reinstatement to supervision or release pending further 
proceeding may nonetheless be ordered if it is determined that:
    (1) Continuation of revocation proceedings is not warranted despite 
the violations found; or
    (2) Incarceration pending further revocation proceedings is not 
warranted by the alleged frequency or seriousness of such violation or 
violations, and that the parolee is not likely to fail to appear for 
further proceedings, and that the parolee does not constitute a danger 
to himself or others.
    (f) Conviction as probable cause. Conviction of a Federal, State, or 
local crime committed subsequent to release by a parolee shall 
constitute probable cause for the purposes of this section and no 
preliminary interview shall be conducted unless otherwise ordered by the 
Regional Commissioner.
    (g) Local revocation hearing. A postponed preliminary interview may 
be conducted as a local revocation hearing by an examiner panel or other 
interviewing officer designated by the Regional Commissioner provided 
that the parolee has been advised that the postponed preliminary 
interview will constitute his final revocation hearing.

<R05>
Sec. 2.49  Place of revocation hearing.

    (a) If the parolee requests a local revocation hearing, he shall be 
given a revocation hearing reasonably near the place of the alleged 
violation(s) or arrest, if the following conditions are met:
    (1) The parolee has not been convicted of a crime committed while 
under supervision; and
    (2) The parolee denies that he has violated any condition of his 
release.
    (b) The parolee shall also be given a local revocation hearing if he 
admits (or has been convicted of) one or more charged violations, but 
denies at least one unadjudicated charge that may be determinative of 
the Commission's decision regarding revocation and/or reparole, and 
requests the presence of one or more adverse witnesses regarding that 
contested charge. If the appearance of such witness at the hearing is 
precluded by the Commission for good cause, a local revocation hearing 
shall not be ordered.
    (c) If there are two or more alleged violations, the hearing may be 
conducted near the place of the violation chiefly relied upon as a basis 
for the issuance of the warrant or summons as determined by the Regional 
Commissioner.
    (d)(1) A parolee shall be given an institutional revocation hearing 
upon the parolee's return or recommitment to an institution if the 
parolee:
    (i) Voluntarily waives the right to a local revocation hearing; or

[[Page 145]]

    (ii) Admits (or has been convicted of) one or more charged 
violations without contesting any unadjudicated charge that may be 
determinative of the Commission's decision regarding revocation and/or 
reparole.
    (2) On his own motion, the Regional Commissioner may designate any 
case described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section for a local 
revocation hearing. The difference in procedures between a ``local 
revocation hearing'' and an ``institutional revocation hearing'' is set 
forth in Sec. 2.50(c).
    (e) A parolee retaken on a warrant issued by the Commission shall be 
retained in custody until final action relative to revocation of his 
release, unless otherwise ordered by the Regional Commissioner under 
Sec. 2.48(e)(2). A parolee who has been given a revocation hearing 
pursuant to the issuance of a summons under Sec. 2.44 shall remain on 
supervision pending the decision of the Commission.
    (f) A local revocation hearing shall be scheduled to be held within 
sixty days of the probable cause determination. Institutional revocation 
hearings shall be scheduled to be held within ninety days of the date of 
the execution of the violator warrant upon which the parolee was 
retaken. However, if a parolee requests and receives any postponement or 
consents to a postponed revocation proceeding, or if a parolee by his 
actions otherwise precludes the prompt conduct of such proceedings, the 
above-stated time limits may be extended. A local revocation hearing may 
be conducted by a hearing examiner, hearing examiner panel, or other 
official designated by the Regional Commissioner.

<R05>
Sec. 2.50  Revocation hearing procedure.

    (a) The purpose of the revocation hearing shall be to determine 
whether the parolee has violated the conditions of his release and, if 
so, whether his parole or mandatory release should be revoked or 
reinstated.
    (b) The alleged violator may present witnesses, and documentary 
evidence in his behalf. However, the presiding hearing officer or 
examiner panel may limit or exclude any irrelevant or repetitious 
statement or documentary evidence.
    (c) At a local revocation hearing, the Commission may on the request 
of the alleged violator or on its own motion, request the attendance of 
persons who have given statements upon which revocation may be based. 
Those witnesses who are present shall be made available for questioning 
and cross-examination in the presence of the alleged violator unless the 
presiding hearing officer or examiner panel finds good cause for their 
non-attendance. Adverse witnesses will not be requested to appear at 
institutional revocation hearings.
    (d) All evidence upon which the finding of violation may be based 
shall be disclosed to the alleged violator at or before the revocation 
hearing. The hearing officer or examiner panel may disclose documentary 
evidence by permitting the alleged violator to examine the document 
during the hearing, or where appropriate, by reading or summarizing the 
document in the presence of the alleged violator.
    (e) In lieu of an attorney, an alleged violator may be represented 
at a revocation hearing by a person of his choice. However, the role of 
such non-attorney representative shall be limited to offering a 
statement on the alleged violator's behalf with regard to reparole or 
reinstatement to supervision.
    (f) A revocation decision may be appealed under the provisions of 
Sec. 2.26 or Sec. 2.27 as applicable.

<R05>
Sec. 2.51  Issuance of a subpoena for the appearance of witnesses or 

production of documents.

    (a)(1) Preliminary interview or local revocation hearing: If any 
person who has given information upon which revocation may be based 
refuses, upon request by the Commission to appear, the Regional 
Commissioner may issue a subpoena for the appearance of such witness. 
Such subpoena may also be issued at the discretion of the Regional

[[Page 146]]

Commissioner in the event such adverse witness is judged unlikely to 
appear as requested.
    (2) In addition, the Regional Commissioner may, upon his own motion 
or upon a showing by the parolee that a witness whose testimony is 
necessary to the proper disposition of his case will not appear 
voluntarily at a local revocation hearing or provide an adequate written 
statement of his testimony, issue a subpoena for the appearance of such 
witness at the revocation hearing.
    (3) Both such subpoenas may also be issued at the discretion of the 
Regional Commissioner if it is deemed necessary for orderly processing 
of the case.
    (b) A subpoena issued pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section 
above may require the production of documents as well as, or in lieu of, 
a personal appearance. The subpoena shall specify the time and the place 
at which the person named therein is commanded to appear, and shall 
specify any documents required to be produced.
    (c) A subpoena may be served by any Federal officer authorized to 
serve criminal process. The subpoena may be served at any place within 
the judicial district in which the place specified in the subpoena is 
located, or any place where the witness may be found. Service of a 
subpoena upon a person named therein shall be made by delivering a copy 
thereof to such person.
    (d) If a person refuses to obey such subpoena, the Commission may 
petition a court of the United States for the judicial district in which 
the parole proceeding is being conducted, or in which such person may be 
found, to require such person to appear, testify, or produce evidence. 
The court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the 
Commission, and failure to obey such an order is punishable by contempt.


<R05>
Sec. 2.52  Revocation decisions.

    (a) Whenever a parolee is summoned or retaken by the Commission, and 
the Commission finds by a preponderance of the evidence, that the 
parolee has violated a condition of the parole, the Commission may take 
any of the following actions:
    (1) Restore the parolee to supervision including where appropriate:
    (i) Reprimand;
    (ii) Modification of the parolee's conditions of release;
    (iii) Referral to a community corrections center for all or part of 
the remainder of his original sentence; or
    (2) Revoke parole.
    (b) If parole is revoked pursuant to this section, the Commission 
shall also determine, on the basis of the revocation hearing, whether 
reparole is warranted or whether the prisoner should be continued for 
further review.
    (c) A parolee whose release is revoked by the Commission will 
receive credit on service of his sentence for time spent under 
supervision, except as provided below:
    (1) If the Commission finds that such parolee intentionally refused 
or failed to respond to any reasonable request, order, summons or 
warrant of the Commission or any agent thereof, the Commission may order 
the forfeiture of the time during which the parolee so refused or failed 
to respond, and such time shall not be credited to service of the 
sentence.
    (2) It is the Commission's interpretation of 18 U.S.C. 4210(b)(2) 
that, if a parolee has been convicted of a new offense committed 
subsequent to his release on parole, which is punishable by any term of 
imprisonment, detention, or incarceration in any penal facility, 
forfeiture of time from the date of such release to the date of 
execution of the warrant is an automatic statutory penalty, and such 
time shall not be credited to the service of the sentence. An actual 
term of confinement or imprisonment need not have been imposed for such 
conviction; it suffices that the statute under which the parolee was 
convicted permits the trial court to impose any term of confinement or 
imprisonment in any penal facility. If such conviction occurs subsequent 
to a revocation hearing the Commission may reopen the case and schedule 
a further hearing relative to time forfeiture and such further 
disposition as may be appropriate. However, in no event shall the 
violator term imposed under this subsection, taken together

[[Page 147]]

with the time served before release, exceed the total length of the 
original sentence.
    (d)(1) Notwithstanding the above, prisoners committed under the 
Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act or the Youth Corrections Act shall 
not be subject to any forfeiture provision, but shall serve 
uninterrupted sentences from the date of conviction, except as provided 
in Sec. 2.10 (b) and (c).
    (2) The commitment of a juvenile offender under the Federal Juvenile 
Delinquency Act may not be extended past the offender's twenty-first 
birthday unless the juvenile has attained his nineteenth birthday at the 
time of his commitment, in which case his commitment shall not exceed 
the lesser of two years or the maximum term which could have been 
imposed on an adult convicted of the same offense.
    (e) In determining whether to revoke parole for non-compliance with 
a condition of fine, restitution, court costs or assessment, and/or 
court ordered child support or alimony payment, the Parole Commission 
shall consider the parolee's employment status, earning ability, 
financial resources, and any other special circumstances that may have a 
bearing on the matter. Revocation shall not be ordered unless the 
parolee is found to be deliberately evading or refusing compliance.

           Appendix to Sec. 2.52--General Statement of Policy

    In the case of any revocation hearing conducted within the Ninth 
Circuit, the Commission will exercise discretion in determining whether 
or not to order forfeiture of all or part of the time spent on parole 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 4210(b)(2). The Commission's policy shall be to 
consider granting credit for time on parole in the case of a parole 
violator originally classified in the very good risk category (pursuant 
to 28 CFR 2.20) if the following conditions are met. The conviction must 
not be for a felony offense. The parole violation behavior (the offense 
of conviction plus any other violations) must be non-violent, and not 
involve a repeat of the parole violator's original offense behavior. 
Further, an adequate period of reimprisonment pursuant to the reparole 
guidelines at 28 CFR 2.21, and an adequate period of renewed supervision 
following release from reimprisonment or reinstatement to supervision, 
must be available without forfeiting street time. In the case of a 
parole violator originally classified in other than the ``very good 
risk'' category, it shall be the Commission's policy to order the 
forfeiture of all time spent on parole absent extraordinary 
circumstances. In no instance will the Commission grant credit in the 
case of a repeat violator on the current sentence.

Sec. 2.53  Mandatory parole.

    (a) A prisoner (including a prisoner sentenced under the Narcotic 
Addict Rehabilitation Act, Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act, or the 
provisions of 5010(c) of the Youth Corrections Act) serving a term or 
terms of 5 years or longer shall be released on parole after completion 
of two-thirds of each consecutive term or terms or after completion of 
30 years of each term or terms of more than 45 years (including life 
terms), whichever comes earlier, unless pursuant to a hearing under this 
section, the Commission determines that there is a reasonable 
probability that the prisoner will commit any Federal, State, or local 
crime or that the prisoner has frequently or seriously violated the 
rules of the institution in which he is confined. If parole is denied 
pursuant to this section, such prisoner shall serve until the expiration 
of his sentence less good time.
    (b) When feasible, at least 60 days prior to the scheduled two-
thirds date, a review of the record shall be conducted by an examiner 
panel. If a mandatory parole is ordered following this review, no 
hearing shall be conducted.
    (c) A prisoner released on mandatory parole pursuant to this section 
shall remain under supervision until the expiration of the full term of 
his sentence unless the Commission terminates parole supervision 
pursuant to Sec. 2.43 prior to the full term date of the sentence.
    (d) A prisoner whose parole has been revoked and whose parole 
violator term is 5 years or more shall be eligible for mandatory parole 
under the provisions of this section upon completion of two-thirds of 
the violator term and shall be considered for mandatory parole under the 
same terms as any other eligible prisoner.

    The Attorney General, within thirty days after entry of a Regional 
Commissioner's decision, may request in writing that the National 
Appeals Board review such decision. Within sixty days of the receipt of 
the request the National Appeals Board shall, upon the concurrence of 
two members, affirm, modify, or reverse the decision, or order a 
rehearing at the institutional or regional level. The Attorney General 
and the prisoner affected shall be informed in writing of the decision, 
and the reasons therefor.

<R05>
Sec. 2.55  Disclosure of file prior to parole hearing.

    (a) Processing disclosure requests. At least 60 days prior to a 
hearing scheduled pursuant to 28 CFR 2.12 or 2.14 each prisoner shall be 
given notice of his right to request disclosure of the reports and other 
documents to be used by the Commission in making its determination.
    (1) The Commission's file consists mainly of documents provided by 
the Bureau of Prisons. Therefore, disclosure of documents used by the 
Commission can normally be accomplished by disclosure of documents in a 
prisoner's institutional file. Requests for disclosure of a prisoner's 
institutional file will be handled under the Bureau of Prison's 
disclosure regulations. The Bureau of Prisons has 15 days from date of 
receipt of a disclosure request to respond to that request.
    (2) A prisoner may also request disclosure of documents used by the 
Commission which are contained in the Commission's regional office file 
but not in the prisoner's institutional file.
    (3) Upon the prisoner's request, a representative shall be given 
access to the presentence investigation report reasonably in advance of 
the initial hearing, interim hearing, and a 15-year reconsideration 
hearing, pursuant and subject to the regulations of the U.S. Bureau of 
Prisons. Disclosure shall not be permitted with respect to confidential 
material withheld by the sentencing court under Rule 32(c)(3)(A), 
F.R.Crim.P.
    (b) Scope of disclosure. The scope of disclosure under this section 
is limited to reports and other documents to be used by the Commission 
in making its determination. At statutory interim hearings conducted 
pursuant to 28 CFR 2.14 the Commission only considers information 
concerning significant developments or changes in the prisoner's status 
since the initial hearing or a prior interim hearing. Therefore, 
prehearing disclosure for interim hearings will be limited to such 
information.
    (c) Exemption to disclosure (18 U.S.C. 4208(c)). A document may be 
withheld from disclosure to the extent it contains:
    (1) Diagnostic opinions which, if known to the prisoner, could lead 
to a serious disruption of his institutional program;
    (2) Material which would reveal a source of information obtained 
upon a promise of confidentiality; or
    (3) Any other information which, if disclosed, might result in harm, 
physical or otherwise to any person.
    (d) Summarizing nondisclosable documents. If any document or portion 
of a document is found by the Commission, the Bureau of Prisons or the 
originating agency to fall within an exemption to disclosure, the agency 
shall:
    (1) Identify the material to be withheld; and
    (2) State the exemption to disclosure under paragraph (c) of this 
section; and
    (3) Provide the prisoner with a summary of the basic content of the 
material withheld with as much specificity as possible without revealing 
the nondisclosable information.
    (e) Waiver of disclosure. When a timely request has been made for 
disclosure, if any document or summary of a document relevant to the 
parole determination has not been disclosed 30 days prior to the 
hearing, the prisoner shall be offered the opportunity to waive 
disclosure of such document without prejudice to his right to later 
review the document or a summary of the document. The examiner panel may 
disclose the document and proceed with the hearing so long as the 
prisoner waives his right to advance disclosure. If the

[[Page 149]]

prisoner chooses not to waive prehearing disclosure, the examiner panel 
shall continue the hearing to the next docket to permit disclosure. A 
continuance for disclosure should not be extended beyond the next 
hearing docket.
    (f) Late received documents. If a document containing new and 
significant adverse information is received after a parole hearing but 
before all review and appellate procedures have been concluded, the 
prisoner shall be given a rehearing on the next docket. A copy of the 
document shall be forwarded to the institution for inclusion in the 
prisoner's institutional file. The Commission shall notify the prisoner 
of the new hearing and his right to request disclosure of the document 
pursuant to this section. If a late received document provides favorable 
information, merely restates already available information or provides 
insignificant information, the case will not be reopened for disclosure.
    (g) Reopened cases. Whenever a case is reopened for a new hearing 
and there is a document the Commission intends to use in making its 
determination, a copy of the document shall be forwarded for inclusion 
in the prisoner's institutional file and the prisoner shall be informed 
of his right to request disclosure of the document pursuant to this 
section.

<R05>
Sec. 2.56  Disclosure of Parole Commission file.

    (a) Procedure. Copies of disclosable records pertaining to a 
prisoner or a parolee which are contained in the subject's Parole 
Commission file may be obtained by that prisoner or parolee upon written 
request pursuant to this section. Such requests shall be answered as 
soon as possible in the order of their receipt. Other persons may obtain 
copies of such documents only upon proof of authorization from the 
prisoner or parolee concerned or to the extent permissible under the 
Freedom of Information Act or the Privacy Act of 1974.
    (b) Scope of disclosure. Disclosure under this section shall extend 
to Commission documents concerning the prisoner or parolee making the 
request. Documents which are contained in the regional file and which 
are prepared by agencies other than the Commission which are also 
subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, shall be 
referred to the appropriate agency for a response pursuant to its 
regulations, unless the document has previously been prepared for 
disclosure pursuant to Sec. 2.55, or is fully disclosable on its face, 
or has been prepared by the Bureau of Prisons. Any Bureau of Prisons 
documents in a parole file are duplicates of records in the inmate's 
institutional file. Before referring these documents to the Bureau of 
Prisons (BOP), the Commission will ask the requestor whether he also 
wants the BOP documents in his parole file processed.
    (1) Requests that are only for a copy of the tape recording of a 
hearing will be processed ahead of requests seeking multiple documents 
from the Parole Commission file (priority processing). A requester may 
limit the scope of the request to a tape recording only (or to a tape 
recording and/or up to two documents) and thereby qualify for priority 
processing. For example, a request for the tape recording and the 
examiner's summary of a hearing qualifies for priority processing.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (c) Exemptions to disclosure. A document or segregable portion 
thereof may be withheld from disclosure to the extent it contains 
material exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. 5 
U.S.C. 552(b)(1)-(9).
    (d) Specification of documents withheld. Documents that are withheld 
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section shall be identified for the 
requester together with the applicable exemption for withholding each 
document or portion thereof. In addition, the requester must be informed 
of the right to appeal any non-disclosure to the Office of the Chairman.
    (e) Hearing record. Upon request by the prisoner or parolee 
concerned, the Commission shall make available a copy of any verbatim 
record (e.g., tape recording) which it has retained of a hearing, 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 4208(f).
    (f) Costs. In any case in which billable costs exceed $14.00 (based 
upon the provisions and fee schedules as set forth in the Department of 
Justice regulation

[[Page 150]]

28 CFR 16.10), requesters will be notified that they will be required to 
reimburse the United States for such costs before copies are released.
    (g) Relation to other provisions. Disclosure under this section is 
authorized by 28 CFR 16.85 under which the Parole Commission is exempt 
from the record disclosure provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as 
well as certain other provisions of the Act pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552a(j)(2). Requests submitted under the Freedom of Information Act or 
the Privacy Act for the requester's own records will be processed under 
this section. In no event will the Commission consider satisfaction of a 
request under this section, the Freedom of Information Act, or the 
Privacy Act of 1974, to be a prerequisite to an adequate parole hearing 
under 18 U.S.C. 4208 (for which disclosure is exclusively governed by 
Sec. 2.55 of this part) or to the exercise of a parole applicant's 
appeal rights under 18 U.S.C. 4215. Provisions of the Freedom of 
Information Act not specifically addressed by these regulations 
(including the reading room) are covered by 28 CFR, part 16, subpart A.
    (h) Appeals--(1) Appeals to the Chairman. When a request for access 
to Parole Commission records or a waiver of fees has been denied in 
whole or in part, or when the Commission fails to respond to a request 
within the time limits set forth in the FOIA, the requester may appeal 
the denial of the request to the Chairman of the Commission within 
thirty days from the date of the notice denying the request. An appeal 
to the Chairman shall be made in writing and addressed to the Office of 
the Chairman, U.S. Parole Commission, 5550 Friendship Boulevard, Suite 
420, Chevy Chase, Maryland 20815.
    (2) Decision on appeal. A decision affirming in whole or in part the 
denial of a request shall include a brief statement of the reason or 
reasons for the affirmance, including each FOIA exemption relied upon 
and its relation to each record withheld, and a statement that judicial 
review of the denial is available in the U.S. district court for the 
judicial district in which the requester resides or has his principal 
place of business, the judicial district in which the requested records 
are located, or in the District of Columbia. If the denial of a request 
is reversed on appeal to the Chairman, the requester shall be so 
notified and the request shall be processed promptly by Commission staff 
in accordance with the Chairman's decision on appeal.
    (i) Expedited processing of Requests. (1) The Commission will 
provide expedited processing of a request when a requester has 
demonstrated a compelling need as defined in this section and has 
presented a statement certified by such person to be true and correct to 
the best of such person's knowledge and belief. A requester may 
demonstrate ``compelling need'' by establishing one of the following:
    (i) That failure to obtain the requested records on an expedited 
basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the 
life or physical safety of an individual; or
    (ii) With respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in 
disseminating information, urgency to inform the public concerning 
actual or alleged federal government activity.
    (2) A determination as to whether to provide expedited processing 
shall be made within ten days after the date of the request. However, 
the fact of lawful imprisonment in a correctional facility or revocation 
of parole shall not be deemed to pose an imminent threat to the life or 
physical safety of an individual. The Commission shall process as soon 
as practicable any request for records to which it has granted expedited 
processing. An administrative appeal of a denial of expedited processing 
may be made to the Chairman of the Commission within thirty days from 
the date of notice denying expedited processing.

Sec. 2.57  Special parole terms.

    (a) The Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act, 21 U.S.C. sections 
801 to 966, provides that, on conviction of certain offenses, mandatory 
``special parole terms'' must be imposed by the court as part of the 
sentence. This

[[Page 151]]

term is an additional period of supervision which commences upon 
completion of any period on parole or mandatory release supervision from 
the regular sentence; or if the prisoner is released without 
supervision, commences upon such release.
    (b) At the time of release under the regular sentence, whether under 
full term expiration or under a mandatory release certificate or a 
parole certificate, a separate Special Parole Term certificate will be 
issued to the prisoner by the Bureau of Prisons.
    (c) Should a parolee be found to have violated conditions of release 
during supervision under his regular sentence, i.e., before commencement 
of the Special Parole Term, he may be returned as a violator under his 
regular sentence; the Special Parole Term will follow unaffected, as in 
paragraph (a) of this section. Should a parolee violate conditions of 
release during the Special Parole Term he will be subject to revocation 
on the Special Parole Term as provided in Sec. 2.52, and subject to 
reparole or mandatory release under the Special Parole Term. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 2.52(c), a special parole term 
violator whose parole is revoked shall receive no credit for time spent 
on parole pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 841(c).
    (d) If a prisoner is reparoled under the revoked Special Parole Term 
a certificate of parole to Special Parole Term is issued by the 
Commission. If the prisoner is mandatorily released under the revoked 
``special parole term'' a certificate of mandatory release to Special 
Parole Term will be issued by the Bureau of Prisons.
    (e) If regular parole or mandatory release supervision is terminated 
under Sec. 2.43, the Special Parole Term commences to run at that point 
in time. Early termination from supervision from a Special Parole Term 
may occur as in the case of a regular parole term, except that the time 
periods considered shall commence from the beginning of the Special 
Parole Term.

Sec. 2.60  Superior program achievement.

    (a) Prisoners who demonstrate superior program achievement (in 
addition to a good conduct record) may be considered for a limited 
advancement of the presumptive date previously set according to the 
schedule below. Such reduction will normally be considered at an interim 
hearing or pre-release review. It is to be stressed that a clear conduct 
record is expected; this reduction applies only to cases with documented 
sustained superior program achievement over a period of 9 months or more 
in custody.
    (b) Superior program achievement may be demonstrated in areas such 
as educational, vocational, industry, or counseling programs, and is to 
be considered in light of the specifics of each case. A report from the 
Bureau of Prisons based upon successful completion of a residential 
substance abuse program of at least 500 hours will be given prompt 
review by the Commission for a possible advancement under this section.
    (c) Upon a finding of superior program achievement, a previously set 
presumptive date may be advanced. The normal maximum advancement 
permissible for superior program achievement during the prisoner's 
entire term shall be as set forth in the following schedule. It is the 
intent of

[[Page 152]]

the Commission that this maximum be exceeded only in the most clearly 
exceptional cases.
    (d) Partial advancements may be given (for example, a case with 
superior program achievement during only part of the term or a case with 
both superior program achievement and minor disciplinary infraction(s)). 
Advancements may be given at different times; however, the limits set 
forth in the following schedule shall apply to the total combined 
advancement.
    (e) Schedule of Permissible Reductions for Superior Program 
Achievement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Total months required by original
             presumptive date                   Permissible reduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------
14 months or less.........................  Not applicable.
15 to 22 months...........................  Up to 1 month.
23 to 30 months...........................  Up to 2 months.
31 to 36 months...........................  Up to 3 months.
37 to 42 months...........................  Up to 4 months.
43 to 48 months...........................  Up to 5 months.
49 to 54 months...........................  Up to 6 months.
55 to 60 months...........................  Up to 7 months.
61 to 66 months...........................  Up to 8 months.
67 to 72 months...........................  Up to 9 months.
73 to 78 months...........................  Up to 10 months.
79 to 84 months...........................  Up to 11 months.
85 to 90 months...........................  Up to 12 months.
91 plus months............................  Up to 13 months.\1\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Plus up to 1 additional month for each 6 months or fraction thereof,
  by which the original date exceeds 96 months.

    (f) For cases originally continued to expiration, the statutory good 
time date (calculated under 18 U.S.C. 4161) will be used for computing 
the maximum reduction permissible and as the base from which the 
reduction is to be subtracted for prisoners serving sentences of less 
than five years. For prisoners serving sentences of five or more, the 
two-thirds date (calculated pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 4206(d)) will be used 
for these purposes. If the prisoner's presumptive release date has been 
further reduced by extra good time (18 U.S.C. 4162) and such reduction 
equals or exceeds the reduction applicable for superior program 
achievement, the Commission will not give an additional reduction for 
superior program achievement.

Sec. 2.61  Qualifications of representatives.

    (a) A prisoner or parolee may select any person to appear as his or 
her representative in any proceeding, and any representative will be 
deemed qualified unless specifically disqualified under paragraph (b) or 
(c) of this section. However, an examiner or examiner panel may bar an 
otherwise qualified representative from participating in a particular 
hearing, provided good cause for such action is found and stated in the 
record (e.g., willfully disruptive conduct during the hearing by 
repeated interruption or use of abusive language). In certain 
situations, good cause may be found in advance of the hearing (e.g., 
that the proposed representative is a prisoner in disciplinary 
segregation whose presence at the hearing would pose a risk to security, 
or has a personal interest in the case which appears to conflict with 
that of the parole applicant).
    (b) The Commission may disqualify any representative from appearing 
before it for up to a five-year period if, following a hearing, the 
Commission finds that the representative has engaged in any conduct 
which demonstrates a clear lack of personal integrity or fitness to 
practice before the Commission (including, but not limited to, 
deliberate or repetitive provision of false information to the 
Commission, or solicitation of clients on the strength of purported 
personal influence with U.S. Parole Commissioners or staff).
    (c)(1) In addition to the prohibitions contained in 18 U.S.C. 207, 
no former employee of any Federal criminal justice agency (in either the 
Executive or Judicial Branch of the Government) with the exception of 
the Federal Defender Service, shall be qualified to act as a 
representative for hire in any case before the Commission for one year 
following termination of Federal employment. However, such persons may 
be employed by, or perform consulting services for, a private firm or 
other organization providing representation before the agency, to the 
extent that such employment or service does not include the performance 
of any representational act before the Commission.

[[Page 153]]

    (2) No prisoner or parolee may serve as a representative before the 
Commission, at the hire of individual clients, in any case.

Sec. 2.62  Rewarding assistance in the prosecution of other offenders; 

criteria and guidelines.

    (a) The Commission may consider as a factor in the parole release 
decision-making a prisoner's assistance to law enforcement authorities 
in the prosecution of other offenders.
    (1) The assistance must have been an important factor in the 
investigation and/or prosecution of an offender other than the prisoner. 
Other significant assistance (e.g., providing information critical to 
prison security) may also be considered.
    (2) The assistance must be reported to the Commission in sufficient 
detail to permit a full evaluation. However, no promises, express or 
implied, as to a Parole Commission reward shall be given any weight in 
evaluating a recommendation for leniency.
    (3) The release of the prisoner must not threaten the public safety.
    (4) The assistance must not have been adequately rewarded by other 
official action.
    (b) If the assistance meets the above criteria, the Commission may 
consider providing a reduction of up to one year from the presumptive 
parole date that the Commission would have deemed warranted had such 
assistance not occurred. If the prisoner would have been continued to 
the expiration of sentence, any reduction will be taken from the actual 
date of the expiration of the sentence. Reductions exceeding the one 
year limit specified above may be considered only in exceptional 
circumstances.
    (c) In the case of an eligible DC Code prisoner whose assistance 
meets the criteria of this section, the Commission may consider 
deducting a point under Category V of the Point Assignment Table at 
Sec. 2.80, in addition to any other deduction for positive program 
achievement, when considering such prisoner for parole. In the case of a 
DC Code prisoner with an unserved minimum term, the Commission may 
consider filing an application under Sec. 2.76 for a reduction of up to 
one-third of such term less applicable good time.

Sec. 2.64  Youth Corrections Act.

    (a) The provisions of this section only apply to offenders serving 
sentences imposed under former 18 U.S.C. section 5010 (b) and (c).
    (b) Approval of program plans. (1) The criteria outlined in 
paragraph (d) of this section (on determining successful response to 
treatment) shall be considered in determining whether a proposed program 
plan will effectively reduce the risk to the public welfare presented by 
the YCA prisoner's release.
    (2) If the prisoner's program plan has not already been approved by 
the Commission, the examiner panel shall be given the plan at a hearing 
for review and approval. The examiners shall indicate their approval or 
disapproval of the program plan (with relevant comments and 
recommendations) in the hearing summary.
    (3) If the examiners consider the plan inadequate, they will discuss 
their concerns with institutional staff. If there is still a 
disagreement on the plan, the case will be referred to the Bureau's 
regional correctional programs administrator with the recommended 
changes. Unresolved disputes concerning the adequacy of the program plan 
shall be decided by the Regional Commissioner and the Regional Director 
of the Bureau of Prisons. The Regional Commissioner shall render the 
final decision on approving or disapproving each program plan on behalf 
of the Commission. Once the program plan has been approved, subsequent 
approvals are not necessary, unless significant modifications are made 
by institutional staff.

[[Page 154]]

    (c) Parole hearings and progress reports. (1) Initial hearings shall 
be conducted in accordance with Sec. Sec. 2.12 and 2.13. The examiner 
panel will discuss with the prisoner and a staff member who is 
knowledgeable about the case the program plan and the importance of good 
conduct and program participation is setting the release date.
    (2) An interim hearing must be scheduled for an inmate every nine 
months if the inmate is serving a sentence of less than seven years. If 
the inmate is serving a sentence of seven years or more, the interim 
hearing must be scheduled every twelve months. If the inmate has been 
continued to the expiration of his sentence, and he has less than twelve 
months remaining to be served prior to his release or his transfer to a 
community corrections center, no further hearing is required. In 
addition, within 60 days of receipt of any special progress report from 
the warden recommending parole, the prisoner shall be scheduled for a 
special interim hearing, unless the recommendation can be timely 
considered at a regularly scheduled interim hearing. An institutional 
staff member who has personal knowledge of the case shall be present to 
assist the examiners in their evaluation of the prisoner's conduct, 
program performance, and response to treatment.
    (3) After any interim hearing or review on the record, the 
Commission may advance the presumptive release date, let the date stand, 
or retard/rescind the date if the prisoner has committed disciplinary 
infractions or new criminal conduct.
    (4) An interim hearing will not be scheduled after receipt of a 
progress report, if the Commission decides on the record to parole the 
prisoner as soon as a release plan is approved (normally within 60 days 
of the decision).
    (5) The institution shall send a progress report to the Commission:
    (i) No more than 60 days before each interim hearing;
    (ii) Upon determining that a prisoner should be recommended for 
parole; and
    (iii) Before presumptive parole date to allow for the pre-release 
record review under Sec. 2.14(b).

The warden may forward progress reports to the Commission at other times 
in his discretion. Progress reports shall also be sent to the Commission 
every six months for prisoners who have waived interim hearings to 
enable the Commission to verify that these prisoners have satisfied the 
conditions of securing their release on an alternative parole date 
granted under the former YCA compliance plan (i.e., completion of the 
program plan) or the normal presumptive release date (i.e., obedience to 
institutional rules).
    (6) For prisoners granted earlier parole dates under former 
compliance plans in Watts v. Bleaski: A prisoner may waive interim 
hearings under this section, in which case he would retain an 
alternative parole date previously granted to him or a presumptive 
parole date granted as a result of a finding that the prisoner had 
responded to treatment. A prisoner who waives an interim hearing under 
this section may, at any time, re-apply for the hearing and be 
considered under this section in accordance with the application/waiver 
provisions at Sec. 2.11. The Commission will not review the program 
plans for prisoners who waive interim hearings pursuant to this 
paragraph, unless the prisoner subsequently is scheduled for a hearing 
to consider new criminal conduct or a rule infraction and a modification 
of the original program plan appears warranted due to the prisoner's new 
criminal offense or infraction. If the prisoner is scheduled for a 
hearing that may not be waived (e.g., an interim hearing where there has 
been a finding of a disciplinary infraction since the last hearing, or 
any hearing scheduled pursuant to Sec. 2.28 (b) through (f), this 
section will be applied at such hearing.
    (7) Warden's recommendation. Based on the completion of the program 
by the prisoner, and the quality of effort demonstrated by the prisoner 
in completing the plan, the warden will recommend to the Commission a 
conditional release date for its consideration. This recommendation 
shall be accompanied by a report on the prisoner's participation and 
level of achievement in different aspects of his program.

[[Page 155]]

    (d) Criteria for finding successful response to treatment programs. 
(1) In determining whether a prisoner has successfully ``responded to 
treatment'' the Commission shall examine whether the prisoner has shown 
that he has received sufficient corrective training, counseling, 
education, and therapy that the public would not be endangered by his 
release. See former 18 U.S.C. 5006(f) (definition of ``treatment'' under 
the YCA). The Bureau of Prisons shall assist the Commission in this 
determination by informing the Commission when the prisoner has 
completed his program plan and by advising the Commission of the quality 
of effort demonstrated by the prisoner in completing the plan.
    (2) In determining the extent of a prisoner's positive response to 
treatment, the Commission shall examine the degree by which the prisoner 
has increased the likelihood that his release would not jeopardize 
public welfare through his program performance and conduct record. See 
18 U.S.C. 4206(a)(2). The starting report for the analysis of a 
prisoner's response to treatment will be the original parole prognosis 
reached by the use of the salient factor score, and an evaluation of the 
nature of the prisoner's prior criminal history and other 
characteristics of the prisoner. The nature of the current offense may 
also be considered in determining the risk to the public welfare 
presented by the prisoner's release. The Commission will then proceed to 
evaluate whether the prisoner's program participation and institutional 
conduct has improved the original risk prognosis and evidences an 
alteration of his valued system, including an understanding of the 
wrongfulness of his past criminal conduct. For those prisoners who have 
exhibited serious or violent criminal behavior, the Commission will 
exercise more caution in making a finding that the prisoner has 
responded to treatment to the degree that he should be released.
    (3) With regard to program performance, significant weight will be 
given to the following factors in determining a prisoner's response to 
treatment. This is not intended as an exhaustive list.
    (i) Vocational training: Where the inmate originally had few job 
skills, the acquisition of a marketable job skill through vocational 
training or an apprenticeship program.
    (ii) Education: Participation in educational programs to acquire an 
educational level at least the level of a high school graduate.
    (iii) Psychological counseling and therapy: Where the prisoner's 
behavior has shown that he may be affected by personality disorders or a 
mental illness that has hampered his ability to lead a law-abiding life, 
or that he may otherwise benefit from such programs, participation in 
psychological and/or other specialized programs which lead to a judgment 
by the therapist/counselor that the prisoner has significantly improved 
his ability to obey the law and favorably modified his value system. 
Participation in these programs will normally be required for a 
significant advancement of the presumptive release date for a prisoner 
who has either committed or attempted a crime of violence.
    (iv) Drug/alcohol abuse programs: Where the prisoner has a history 
of drug/alcohol abuse, participation in a drug/alcohol abuse program 
which leads to the judgment by the therapist/counselor that there is a 
significant likelihood that the prisoner will not revert to drug/alcohol 
abuse and has thereby significantly improved his ability to obey the 
law.
    (v) Work: Assuming the prisoner is physically and mentally able to 
do so and is not otherwise engaged in an institutional activity which 
prevents him from obtaining a job, participation in a job on a regular 
basis so as to demonstrate a stable life pattern and a favorable 
modification of his value system.
    (4) Prison misconduct (i.e., disobedience to institutional rules, 
escape) and new criminal conduct in the institution shall be considered 
in the decision as to whether (or to what degree) a prisoner has 
successfully responded to treatment. The rescission guidelines of 2.36 
shall be used in retarding or rescinding the original presumptive 
release date set according to the guidelines and the factors described 
in 18 U.S.C. 4206. If the original presumptive

[[Page 156]]

date has been advanced based on response to treatment, the rescission 
guidelines may also be used to retard or rescind the new date to 
maintain institutional discipline, if the misconduct is not deemed 
serious enough to affect the decision that the prisoner has responded to 
treatment. But misconduct subsequent to the advancement of a release 
date based on a finding of response to treatment may also result in a 
reversal of that finding and the cancellation of any advancement of the 
original presumptive release date.
    (e) Setting the parole date (balancing section 4206 factors with 
response to treatment). At any hearing or review on the record, the 
presumptive release date may be advanced if it is determined that the 
prisoner has responded to a sufficient degree to his treatment programs. 
The amount of the advancement should be proportional to the degree of 
response evidenced by the prisoner. In making the advancement, no rule 
restricting the amount of the reduction--whether based on the guidelines 
(Sec. 2.20) or the rule on superior program achievement (Sec. 2.60)--
shall be used. The decision will be the result of a case-by-case 
evaluation in which response to treatment programs, the seriousness of 
the offense, and the original parole prognosis are all weighed by the 
Commission with no one factor capable of excluding all others.
    (f) Parole violators. Parole violators returned to an institution 
following a local revocation hearing shall normally be considered for 
reparole under this section at a hearing within six months of their 
arrival at the institution.
    (g) Early termination from supervision. (1) A review of the YCA 
parolee's file will be conducted at the conclusion of each year of 
supervision (following receipt of the annual progress report--Form F-3) 
and six months prior to the expiration of his sentence (after receipt of 
the final report).
    (2) A YCA parolee shall not be continued on supervision beyond the 
time periods specified in the early termination guidelines (Sec. 2.43), 
unless case-specific factors indicate further supervision is warranted. 
The guidelines at Sec. 2.43 shall not be routinely used to deny early 
discharge to a YCA parolee who has yet to complete two (or three) years 
of clean supervision.
    (3) The Commission shall consider the facts and circumstances of 
each YCA parolee's case, focusing on the risk he poses to the public and 
the benefit he may obtain from further supervision. The nature of the 
offense and parolee's past criminal record shall be taken into account 
only to evaluate the risk that the parolee may still pose to the public.
    (4) In denying early discharge, the Commission shall inform the 
probation office by letter (with a copy to the YCA parolee) of the 
reasons for continued supervision. The reasons should pertain, whenever 
possible, to the facts and circumstances of the YCA parolee's case. If 
there are no case-specific factors which indicate that discharge should 
be either granted to denied and further supervision appears warranted, 
the Commission may inform the YCA parolee that he is continued on 
supervision because of its experience with similarly situated offenders.

Sec. 2.65  Paroling policy for prisoners serving aggregate U.S. and D.C. Code 

sentences.

    (a) Applicability. This regulation applies to all prisoners serving 
any combination of U.S. and D.C. Code sentences that have been 
aggregated by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. Such individuals are 
considered for parole on the basis of a single parole eligibility and 
mandatory release date on the aggregate sentence. Pursuant to Sec. 2.5, 
every decision made by the Commission, including the grant, denial, and 
revocation of parole, is made on the basis of the aggregate sentence.
    (b) Basic policy. The Commission shall apply the guidelines at Sec. 
2.20 to the prisoner's U.S. Code crimes, and the guidelines of the 
District of Columbia Board of Parole to the prisoner's D.C. Code crimes.
    (c) Determining the federal guideline range. The Commission shall 
first consider the U.S. Code offenses pursuant to the guidelines at 
Sec. 2.20, and shall determine the appropriate number of

[[Page 157]]

months to be served (the prisoner's ``federal time''). The Commission 
shall deem the ``federal time'' to have commenced with the prisoner's 
initial commitment on the current aggregate sentence, including jail 
time.
    (d) Decisions above the federal guideline range. The ``federal 
time'' thus determined may be a decision within, below or above the 
federal guidelines, but it shall not exceed the limit of the U.S. Code 
sentence, i.e., the number of months that would be required by the 
statutory release date if the U.S. Code sentence is less than five 
years, or the two-thirds date if the U.S. Code sentence is five years or 
more. The D.C. Code criminal behavior may not be used as an aggravating 
offense factor, but may be used as predictive basis for exceeding the 
federal guideline range to account for the actual degree and/or 
seriousness of risk.
    (e) Scheduling the D.C. parole hearing. The Commission shall then 
schedule a D.C. parole hearing to be conducted not later than four 
months prior to the parole eligibility date, or the expiration of the 
``federal time,'' whichever is later. At the D.C. parole hearing the 
Commission shall apply the point score system of the D.C. Board of 
Parole, pursuant to the regulations of the D.C. Board of Parole, to 
determine the prisoner's suitability for release on parole.
    (f) Granting parole. In determining whether or not to grant parole 
pursuant to the point score system of the D.C. Board of Parole, and the 
length of any continuance for a rehearing if parole is denied, the 
Commission shall presume that the eligible prisoner has satisfied basic 
accountability for the D.C. Code offense behavior. However, the 
Commission retains the authority to consider any unusual offense 
circumstances pursuant to 28 DCMR 204.22 to deny parole despite a 
favorable point score, and to set a rehearing date beyond the ordinary 
schedule. The Commission shall also consider whether the totality of the 
prisoner's offense behaviors (U.S. and D.C. Code) warrants a continuance 
to reflect the true seriousness or the degree of the risk that the 
release of the prisoner would pose for the public welfare. Nonetheless, 
the Commission shall not deny parole or order a continuance, solely on 
the ground of punishment for the U.S. Code offenses standing alone, or 
on grounds that have been adequately accounted for in a decision to 
exceed the federal guideline range.
    (g) Hearings. The Commission shall, in accordance with Sec. 2.12 of 
these regulations, conduct an initial hearing to determine the federal 
time. This portion of the decision shall be subject to appeal pursuant 
to Sec. 2.26 of these regulations. A D.C. parole hearing to determine 
the prisoner's suitability for parole under the D.C. guidelines shall be 
conducted as ordered at the initial hearing. Prior to the D.C. parole 
hearing, statutory interim hearings shall be conducted pursuant to Sec. 
2.14 of these regulations, including an interim hearing at eligibility 
on the aggregate sentence if no other interim hearing would be held. 
After the D.C. parole hearing, rehearings shall be conducted pursuant to 
the rules and policy guidelines of the D.C. Board of Parole, if release 
on parole is not granted.
    (h) Revocation decisions. Violations of parole are violations on the 
aggregate sentence, and a parole violation warrant is therefore issued 
under the authority of the aggregate sentence. With regard to the 
reparole decision, the Commission shall follow the guidelines at Sec. 
2.21 of these rules, but rehearings shall be scheduled according to the 
guidelines of the D.C. Board of Parole.
    (i) Forfeiture of street time. All time on parole shall be forfeited 
if required under Sec. 2.52(c) of these regulations. If not, the 
Commission shall divide the total time on parole (street time) according 
to the proportional relationship of the D.C. sentence to the U.S. 
sentence, and shall order the forfeiture of the portion corresponding to 
the D.C. sentence pursuant to D.C. Code 24-406(a). For example, if the 
prisoner is serving a two-year D.C. Code sentence and a three-year U.S. 
Code sentence, the D.C. sentence is two-fifths, or 40 percent, of the 
total aggregate sentence. If he was on parole 100 days, he therefore 
forfeits 40 days. ``Street time'' is measured from the date of release 
on parole to the execution of the

[[Page 158]]

warrant or confinement on other charges.

Sec. 2.66  Expedited Revocation Procedure.

    (a) In addition to the actions available to the Commission under 
Sec. 2.47(a) and (b), and under Sec. 2.48, the Commission may offer an 
alleged parole violator an opportunity to accept responsibility for his 
violation behavior, to waive a revocation hearing, and to accept the 
sanction proposed by the Commission in the Notice of Eligibility for 
Expedited Revocation Procedure that is sent to the alleged parole 
violator.
    (b) The following cases may be considered under the expedited 
revocation procedure:
    (1) Cases in which the alleged parole violator has been given a 
preliminary interview under Sec. 2.48, and the alleged violation 
behavior would be graded Category One or Category Two;
    (2) Cases in which the alleged violator has been given a preliminary 
interview under Sec. 2.48 and the proposed decision is continue to 
expiration of sentence, regardless of offense category; and
    (3) Cases in which an alleged violator has received a dispositional 
review under Sec. 2.47, and the Commission determines that conditional 
withdrawal of the warrant would be appropriate, but forfeiture of street 
time is deemed necessary to provide an adequate period of supervision.
    (c) The alleged violator's consent shall not be deemed to create an 
enforceable agreement with respect to any action the Commission is 
authorized to take by law or regulation, or to limit in any respect the 
normal statutory consequences of a revocation of parole or mandatory 
release.

<R04>
            Subpart B_Transfer Treaty Prisoners and Parolees


<R05>
Sec. 2.68  Prisoners transferred pursuant to treaty.

    (a) Applicability, jurisdiction and statutory interpretation. (1) 
Prisoners transferred pursuant to treaty (transferees) who committed 
their offenses on or after November 1, 1987, shall receive a special 
transferee hearing pursuant to the procedures found in this section and 
18 U.S.C. 4106A. Transferees who committed their offenses prior to 
November 1, 1987, are immediately eligible for parole and shall receive 
a parole hearing pursuant to procedures found at 28 CFR 2.13. The Parole 
Commission shall treat the foreign conviction as though it were a lawful 
conviction in a United States District Court.
    (2) The jurisdiction of the Commission to set a release date and 
periods and conditions of supervised release extends until the 
transferee is released from prison or the transferee's case is otherwise 
transferred to a district court pursuant to an order of the Commission.
    (3) It is the Commission's interpretation of 18 U.S.C. 4106A that 
every transferee is entitled to a release date determination by the 
Commission after considering the applicable sentencing guidelines in 
effect at the time of the hearing. Upon release from imprisonment the 
transferee may be required to serve a period of supervised release 
pursuant to section 5D1.2 of the sentencing guidelines. The combination 
of the period of imprisonment that results from the release date set by 
the Commission and the period of supervised release shall not exceed the 
full term of the sentence imposed by the foreign court. The combined 
periods of imprisonment and supervised release may be less than the full 
term of the sentence imposed by the foreign court unless the applicable 
treaty is found to require otherwise.
    (4) The applicable offense guideline provision is determined by 
selecting the offense in the U.S. Code that is most similar to the 
offense for which the transferee was convicted in the foreign court. In 
so doing, the Commission considers itself required by law

[[Page 159]]

and treaty to respect the offense definitions contained in the foreign 
criminal code under which the prisoner was convicted, as well as the 
official documents supplied by the foreign court.
    (5) The release date that is determined by the Commission under 18 
U.S.C. 4106A(b)(1)(A) is a prison release determination and does not 
represent the imposition of a new sentence for the transferee. However, 
the release date shall be treated by the Bureau of Prisons as if it were 
the full term date of a sentence for the purpose of establishing a 
release date pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 4105(c)(1). The Bureau of Prisons 
release date shall supersede the release date established by the Parole 
Commission under 18 U.S.C. 4106A and shall be the date upon which the 
transferee's period of supervised release commences. If the Commission 
has ordered ``continue to expiration,'' the 4106A release date is the 
same as the full term date of the foreign sentence. It is the 
Commission's interpretation of 18 U.S.C. 4105(c)(1) that the deduction 
of service credits in either case does not operate to reduce the foreign 
sentence or otherwise limit the Parole Commission's authority to 
establish a period of supervised release extending from the date of 
actual release from prison to the full term date of the foreign 
sentence.
    (6) If the Commission sets a release date under 18 U.S.C. 
4106A(b)(1)(A) that is earlier than the mandatory release date 
established by the Bureau of Prisons under 18 U.S.C. 4105(c)(1), then 
the release date set by the Commission controls. If the release date set 
by the Commission under 18 U.S.C. 4106A(b)(1)(A) is equal to or later 
than the mandatory release date established by the Bureau of Prisons 
under 18 U.S.C. 4105(c)(1), then the mandatory release date established 
by the Bureau of Prisons controls.
    (7) It is the Commission's interpretation of 18 U.S.C. 4106A that 
U.S. Code provisions for mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment and 
supervised release, as well as sentencing guideline provisions 
implementing such U.S. Code requirements (e.g., section 5G1.1(b) of the 
sentencing guidelines), were not intended by Congress to be applicable 
in an 18 U.S.C. 4106A(b)(1)(A) determination. Alternatively, it is the 
Commission's position that there is good cause in every transfer treaty 
case for a departure from any statutorily required minimum sentence 
provision in the sentencing guidelines, including section 5G1.1(b) of 
the sentencing guidelines, because Congress did not enact mandatory 
sentence laws with transferees in mind. Thus, in every transfer treaty 
case, the release date will be determined through an exercise of 
Commission discretion, according to the sentencing guideline range that 
is derived from a case-specific ``similar offense'' determination, 
rather than by reference to any provision concerning mandatory minimum 
sentences of imprisonment or terms of supervised release.
    (b) Interview upon entry. Following the transferee's entry into the 
United States, the transferee shall, without unnecessary delay, be 
interviewed by a United States Probation Officer who shall inform the 
transferee of his rights under this regulation. The transferee shall be 
given the appropriate forms for appointment of counsel pursuant to 18 
U.S.C. 3006(A) at the interview if appointment of counsel is requested.
    (c) Postsentence report. A postsentence investigation report, which 
shall include an estimated sentencing classification and sentencing 
guideline range, shall be prepared by the probation office in the 
district of entry (or the transferee's home district). Disclosure of the 
postsentence report shall be made as soon as the report is completed, by 
delivery of a copy of the report to the transferee and his or her 
counsel (if any). Confidential material contained in the postsentence 
investigation report may be withheld pursuant to the procedures of 18 
U.S.C. 4208(c). Copies of all documents provided by the transferring 
country relating to the transferee shall be appended to the postsentence 
report when disclosed to the transferee and when transmitted to the 
Commission.
    (d) Opportunity to object. The transferee (or counsel) shall have 
thirty calendar days after disclosure of the postsentence report to 
transmit any objections to the report he or she may have, in writing, to 
the Commission with a copy to the probation officer.

[[Page 160]]

The Commission shall review the objections and may request that 
additional information be submitted by the probation officer in the form 
of an addendum to the postsentence report. Any disputes of fact or 
disputes concerning application of the sentencing guidelines shall be 
resolved at the special transferee hearing.
    (e) Special transferee hearing. A special transferee hearing shall 
be conducted within 180 days from the transferee's entry into the United 
States, or as soon as is practicable following completion of the 
postsentence report along with any corrections or addendum to the report 
and appointment of counsel for an indigent transferee.
    (1) Waivers. The transferee may waive the special transferee hearing 
on a form provided for that purpose, and the Commission may either:
    (A) Set a release date that falls within 60 days of receipt of the 
waiver and establish a period and conditions of supervised release; or
    (B) Reject the waiver and schedule a hearing.
    (2) Short-term cases. In the case of a transferee who has less than 
six months from the date of his entry into the United States to his 
release date as calculated by the Bureau of Prisons under 18 U.S.C. 
4105, the Commission may, without conducting a hearing or awaiting a 
waiver, set a release date and a period and conditions of supervised 
release. In such cases, the period of supervised release shall not 
exceed the minimum necessary to satisfy the applicable sentencing 
guideline (but may extend to the full-term of the foreign sentence if 
such period is shorter than the minimum of applicable sentencing 
guideline). The transferee may petition the Commission for a more 
favorable decision within 60 days of the Commission's determination, and 
the Commission may act upon the petition regardless of whether or not 
the transferee has been released from prison.
    (f) Representation. The transferee shall have the opportunity to be 
represented by counsel (retained by the transferee or, if financially 
unable to retain counsel, counsel shall be provided pursuant to 18 
U.S.C. 3006(A)), at all stages of the proceeding set forth in this 
section. The transferee may select a non-lawyer representative as 
provided in 28 CFR 2.61.
    (g) The decisionmaking criteria. The Commission shall apply the 
guidelines promulgated by the United States Sentencing Commission, as 
though the transferee were convicted in a United States District Court 
of a statutory offense most nearly similar to the offense of which the 
transferee was convicted in the foreign court. The Commission shall take 
into account the offense definition under foreign law, the length of the 
sentence permitted by that law, and the underlying circumstances of the 
offense behavior, to establish a guideline range that fairly reflects 
the seriousness of the offense behavior committed in the foreign 
country.
    (h) Hearing procedures. Special transferee hearings shall be 
conducted by a hearing examiner. Each special transferee hearing shall 
be recorded by a certified court reporter and the proceedings shall be 
transcribed if the determination of the Commission is appealed. The 
following procedures shall apply at a special transferee proceeding, 
unless waived by the transferee:
    (1) The examiner shall inquire whether the transferee and his 
counsel have had an opportunity to read and discuss the postsentence 
investigation report and whether the transferee is prepared to go 
forward with the hearing. If not, the transferee shall be given the 
opportunity to continue the hearing.
    (2) The transferee shall have an opportunity to present documentary 
evidence and to testify on his own behalf.
    (3) Oral testimony of interested parties may be taken with prior 
advance permission of the Regional Commissioner.
    (4) The transferee and his counsel shall be afforded the opportunity 
to comment upon the guideline estimate contained in the postsentence 
investigation report (and the addendum, if any), and to present 
arguments and information relating to the Commission's final guideline 
determination and decision.

[[Page 161]]

    (5) Disputes of material fact shall be resolved by a preponderance 
of the evidence, with written recommended findings by the examiner 
unless the examiner determines, on the record, not to take the 
controverted matter into account.
    (6) The transferee shall be notified of the examiner's recommended 
findings of fact, and the examiner's recommended determination and 
reasons therefore, at the conclusion of the hearing. The case shall 
thereafter be reviewed by the Executive Hearing Examiner pursuant to 
Sec. 2.23, and the Commission shall make its determination upon a panel 
recommendation.
    (i) Final decision. (1) The Commission shall render a decision as 
soon as practicable and without unnecessary delay. Decisions shall be 
made upon a concurrence of two votes of the National Commissioners. The 
decision shall set a release date and a period and conditions of 
supervised release. If the Commission determines that the appropriate 
release date under 18 U.S.C. 4106A is the full term date of the foreign 
sentence, the Commission will order the transferee to ``continue to 
expiration''.
    (2) Whenever the Bureau of Prisons applies service credits under 18 
U.S.C. 4105 to a release date established by the Commission, the release 
date used by the Bureau of Prisons shall be the date established by the 
Parole Commission pursuant to the sentencing guidelines and not a date 
that resulted from any adjustment made to achieve comparable punishment 
with a similarly-situated U.S. Code offender. The application of service 
credits under 18 U.S.C. 4105 shall supersede any previous release date 
set by the Commission. The Commission may, for the purpose of 
facilitating the application of service credits by the Bureau of 
Prisons, reopen any case on the record to clarify the correct release 
date to be used, and the period of supervised release to be served.
    (3) The Commission may, in its discretion, defer a decision and 
order a rehearing, provided that a statement of the reason for ordering 
a rehearing is issued to the transferee and the transferee's counsel (if 
any).
    (4) The Commission's final decision shall be supported by a 
statement of reasons explaining:
    (i) The similar offense selected as the basis for the Commission's 
decision;
    (ii) The basis for the guideline range applied; and
    (iii) The reason for making a release determination above or below 
the guideline range. If the release date is within a guideline range 
that exceeds twenty-four months, the Commission shall identify the 
reason for the release date selected.
    (j) Appeal. The transferee shall be advised of his right to appeal 
the decision of the Commission to the United States Court of Appeals 
that has jurisdiction over the district in which the transferee is 
confined.
    (k) Reopening or modification of a determination prior to transfer 
of jurisdiction. (1) A hearing and assistance of counsel will be 
provided to the transferee whenever a case is reopened under 
subparagraphs (2), (3), (4), and (5) below unless:
    (i) Waived by the transferee; or
    (ii) The action to be taken is favorable and no factual issue must 
be resolved.
    (2) The Commission may reopen and modify a determination based upon 
information which was not previously considered. Such information must, 
however, be contained in the record of the foreign sentencing court.
    (3) The Commission may reopen and modify a determination of the 
terms and conditions of supervised release. Modifications may include 
approval or disapproval of the transferee's release plan.
    (4) The Commission shall reopen and modify a determination that has 
been found on appeal to have been imposed in violation of the law, to 
have been imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the 
sentencing guidelines, or to have been unreasonable.
    (5) The Commission may reopen and modify a determination upon 
consideration of the factors listed in section 5K1.1 of the sentencing 
guidelines if the transferee provides substantial assistance to law 
enforcement authorities, and that assistance was not previously 
considered by the Commission. The Commission will treat a request from a

[[Page 162]]

foreign or a domestic law enforcement authority as the equivalent of a 
``motion of the government.''
    (6) The Commission may modify a determination based upon a clerical 
mistake or other error in accordance with Federal Rules of Criminal 
Procedure Rule 36.
    (7) The Commission may reopen and modify the release date if it 
determines that a circumstance set forth in 18 U.S.C. 3582(c) is 
satisfied.
    (l) Supervised release. (1) If a period of supervised release is 
imposed, the Commission presumes that the recommended conditions of 
supervised release in section 5D1.3(a) and (c) of the sentencing 
guidelines, a condition requiring the transferee to report to the 
probation office within 72 hours of release from the custody of the 
Bureau of Prisons, a condition that the transferee not commit another 
Federal, state or local crime, and a condition that the transferee not 
possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon are reasonably necessary in 
every case. These conditions, therefore, shall be imposed unless the 
Commission finds otherwise. The Commission may also impose special 
conditions of supervised release whenever deemed reasonably necessary in 
an individual case.
    (2) If the transferee is released pursuant to a date established by 
the Bureau of Prisons under 18 U.S.C. 4105(c)(1), then the period of 
supervised release commences upon the transferee's release from 
imprisonment.

<R05>
Sec. 2.70  Authority and functions of the U.S. Parole Commission with respect to District of Columbia Code offenders.

    (a) The U.S. Parole Commission shall exercise authority over 
District of Columbia Code offenders pursuant to section 11231 of the 
National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 
1997, Public Law 105-33, 111 Stat. 712, and D.C. Code 24-409. The rules 
in this subpart shall govern the operation of the U.S. Parole Commission 
with respect to D.C. Code offenders and shall constitute the parole 
rules of the District of Columbia, as amended and supplemented pursuant 
to section 11231(a)(1) of the Act.
    (b) The Commission shall have sole authority to grant parole, and to 
establish the conditions of release, for all District of Columbia Code 
prisoners who are serving sentences for felony offenses, and who are 
eligible for parole by statute, including offenders who have been 
returned to prison upon the revocation of parole or mandatory release. 
(D.C. Code 24-404 and 408). The above authority shall include youth 
offenders who are committed to prison for treatment and rehabilitation 
based on felony convictions under the D.C. Code. (D.C. Code 24-904(a).)
    (c) The Commission shall have authority to recommend to the Superior 
Court of the District of Columbia a reduction in the minimum sentence of 
a District of Columbia Code prisoner, if the Commission deems such 
recommendation to be appropriate. (D.C. Code 24-401(c).)
    (d) The Commission shall have authority to grant parole to a 
prisoner who is found to be geriatric, permanently incapacitated, or 
terminally ill, notwithstanding the minimum term imposed by the 
sentencing court. (D.C. Code 24-461 through 467.)
    (e) The Commission shall have authority over all District of 
Columbia Code felony offenders who have been released to parole or 
mandatory release supervision, including the authority to return such 
offenders to prison upon an order of revocation. (D.C. Code 24-406.)

<R05>
Sec. 2.71  Application for parole.

    (a) A prisoner (including a committed youth offender) desiring to 
apply for parole shall execute an application form as prescribed by the 
Commission. Such forms shall be available at each institution and shall 
be provided to a prisoner who is eligible for parole consideration. The 
Commission may then conduct an initial hearing or grant an effective 
date of parole on the record. A prisoner who receives an initial hearing 
need not apply for subsequent hearings.
    (b) To the extent practicable, the initial hearing for an eligible 
adult prisoner who has applied for parole shall be held at least 180 
days prior to such prisoner's date of eligibility for parole. The 
initial hearing for a committed youth offender shall be scheduled during 
the first 120 days after admission to the institution that is 
responsible for developing his rehabilitative program.
    (c) A prisoner may knowingly and intelligently waive any parole 
consideration on a form provided for that purpose. A prisoner who 
declines either to apply for or waive parole consideration shall be 
deemed to have waived parole consideration.
    (d) A prisoner who waives parole consideration may later apply for 
parole and be heard during the next visit of the Commission to the 
institution at which the prisoner is confined, provided that the 
prisoner has applied for parole at least 60 days prior to the first day 
of the month in which such visit of the Commission occurs. In no event, 
however, shall such prisoner be heard at an earlier date than that set 
forth in paragraph (b) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 2.72  Hearing procedure.

    (a) At the initial hearing the examiner shall review with the 
prisoner the guidelines at Sec. 2.80, and shall discuss with the 
prisoner such information as the examiner deems relevant, including the 
prisoner's offense behavior, criminal history, institutional record, 
health status, release plans, and community support. If the examiner 
determines that the available file material is not adequate for this 
purpose the examiner may order the hearing to be postponed to the next 
docket so that the missing information can be requested.
    (b) A prisoner may have a representative at the hearing pursuant to 
Sec. 2.13(b) and the opportunity for prehearing disclosure of file 
material pursuant to Sec. 2.55.
    (c) A victim of a crime, or a representative of the immediate family 
of a victim if the victim has died, shall have the right:
    (1) To be present at the parole hearings of each offender who 
committed the crime, and
    (2) To testify and/or offer a written or recorded statement as to 
whether or not parole should be granted, including information and 
reasons in support of such statement. A written statement may be 
submitted at the hearing or provided separately. The prisoner may be 
excluded from the hearing room during the appearance of a victim or 
representative who gives testimony. In lieu of appearing at a parole 
hearing, a victim or representative may request permission to appear 
before an examiner (or other staff member), who shall record and 
summarize the victim's or representative's testimony. Whenever new and 
significant information is provided under this rule, the hearing 
examiner will summarize the information at the parole hearing and will 
give the prisoner an opportunity to respond. Such summary shall be 
consistent with a reasonable request for confidentiality by the victim 
or representative.
    (d) Attorneys, family members, relatives, friends of the prisoner, 
or other interested persons desiring to submit information pertinent to 
any prisoner, may do so at any time, but such information must be 
received by the Commission at least 30 days prior to a scheduled hearing 
in order to be considered at that hearing. Such persons may also request 
permission to appear at the offices of the Commission to speak to a 
Commission staff member, provided such request is received at least 30 
days prior to the scheduled hearing. The purpose of this office visit 
will be to supplement the Commission's record with pertinent factual 
information concerning the prisoner, which shall be placed in the record 
for consideration at the hearing. An office visit at a time other than 
set forth in

[[Page 164]]

this paragraph may be authorized only if the Commission finds good cause 
based upon a written request setting forth the nature of the information 
to be discussed. See Sec. 2.22.
    (e) A full and complete recording of every parole hearing shall be 
retained by the Commission. Upon a request pursuant to Sec. 2.56, the 
Commission shall make available to any eligible prisoner such record as 
the Commission has retained of the hearing.
    (f) Because parole decisions must be reached through a record-based 
hearing and voting process, no contacts shall be permitted between any 
person attempting to influence the Commission's decision-making process, 
and the examiners and Commissioners of the Commission, except as 
expressly provided in this subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 2.73  Parole suitability criteria.

    (a) In accordance with D.C. Code 24-404(a), the Commission shall be 
authorized to release a prisoner on parole in its discretion after the 
prisoner has served the minimum term of the sentence imposed, if the 
following criteria are met:
    (1) The prisoner has substantially observed the rules of the 
institution;
    (2) There is a reasonable probability that the prisoner will live 
and remain at liberty without violating the law; and
    (3) In the opinion of the Commission, the prisoner's release is not 
incompatible with the welfare of society.
    (b) It is the policy of the Commission with respect to District of 
Columbia Code offenders that the minimum term imposed by the sentencing 
court presumptively satisfies the need for punishment for the crime of 
which the prisoner has been convicted, and that the responsibility of 
the Commission is to account for the degree and the seriousness of the 
risk that the release of the prisoner would entail. This responsibility 
is carried out by reference to the Salient Factor Score and the Point 
Assignment Table at Sec. 2.80. However, there may be exceptional cases 
in which the gravity of the offense is sufficient to warrant an upward 
departure from Sec. 2.80 and denial of parole.

<R05>
Sec. 2.74  Decision of the Commission.

    (a) Following each initial or subsequent hearing, the Commission 
shall render a decision granting or denying parole, and shall provide 
the prisoner with a notice of action that includes an explanation of the 
reasons for the decision. The decision shall ordinarily be issued within 
21 days of the hearing, excluding weekends and holidays.
    (b) Whenever a decision is rendered within the applicable guideline 
established in this subpart, it will be deemed a sufficient explanation 
of the Commission's decision for the notice of action to set forth how 
the guideline was calculated. If the decision is a departure from the 
guidelines, the notice of action shall include the reasons for such 
departure.
    (c) The Commission shall resolve relevant issues of fact in 
accordance with Sec. 2.19(c). Decisions granting or denying parole 
shall be based on the concurrence of two Commissioners, except that 
three Commissioner votes shall be required if the decision differs from 
the decision recommended by the examiner panel by more than six months. 
A decision releasing a parolee from active supervision shall also be 
based on the concurrence of two Commissioners. All other decisions, 
including decisions on revocation and reparole made pursuant to Sec. 
2.105(c), shall be based on the vote of one Commissioner, except as 
otherwise provided in this subpart.

Sec. 2.75  Reconsideration proceedings.

    (a)(1) Following an initial or subsequent hearing, the Commission 
may--
    (i) Set an effective date of parole within nine months of the date 
of the hearing;
    (ii) Set a presumptive parole date at least ten months but not more 
than three years from the date of the hearing;
    (iii) Continue the prisoner to the expiration of sentence if the 
prisoner's

[[Page 165]]

mandatory release date is within three years of the date of the hearing;
    (iv) Schedule a reconsideration hearing at three years from the 
month of the hearing; or
    (v) Remand the case for a rehearing on the next available docket 
(but no later than 180 days from the date of the hearing) for the 
consideration of additional information.
    (2) Exceptions. (i) With respect to the rule on three-year 
reconsideration hearings. If the prisoner's current offense behavior 
resulted in the death of a victim and, at the time of the hearing, the 
prisoner must serve more than three years before reaching the minimum of 
the applicable guideline range, the Commission may schedule a 
reconsideration hearing at a date up to five years from the month of the 
last hearing, but not beyond the minimum of the applicable guideline 
range.
    (ii) With respect to youth offenders. Regardless of whether a 
presumptive parole date has been set, a reconsideration hearing shall be 
conducted every twelve months for a youth offender, and on the next 
available docket after the Commission is informed that the prisoner has 
completed his program plan.
    (b) When a rehearing is scheduled, the prisoner shall be given a 
rehearing during the month specified by the Commission, or on the docket 
of hearings immediately preceding that month if no docket of hearings is 
scheduled for the month specified.
    (c) At a reconsideration hearing, the Commission may take any action 
that it could take at an initial hearing. The scheduling of a 
reconsideration hearing does not imply that parole will be granted at 
such hearing.
    (d) Prior to a parole reconsideration hearing, the Commission shall 
review the prisoner's record, including an institutional progress report 
which shall be submitted 60 days prior to the hearing. Based on its 
review of the record, the Commission may grant an effective date of 
parole without conducting the scheduled hearing.
    (e) Notwithstanding a previously established reconsideration 
hearing, the Commission may reopen any case for a special 
reconsideration hearing, as provided in Sec. 2.28, upon the receipt of 
new and significant information concerning the prisoner.

Sec. 2.76  Reduction in minimum sentence.

    (a) A prisoner who has served three or more years of the minimum 
term of his or her sentence may request the Commission to file an 
application with the sentencing court for a reduction in the minimum 
term pursuant to D.C. Code 24-401c. The prisoner's request to the 
Commission shall be in writing and shall state the reasons that the 
prisoner believes such request should be granted. The Commission shall 
require the submission of a special progress report before approving 
such a request.
    (b) Approval of a prisoner's request under this section shall 
require the concurrence of a majority of the Commissioners holding 
office.
    (c) Pursuant to D.C. Code 24-401c, the Commission may file an 
application to the sentencing court for a reduction of a prisoner's 
minimum term if the Commission finds that:
    (1) The prisoner has completed three years of the minimum term 
imposed by the court;
    (2) The prisoner has shown, by report of the responsible prison 
authorities, an outstanding response to the rehabilitative program(s) of 
the institution;
    (3) The prisoner has fully observed the rules of each institution in 
which the prisoner has been confined;
    (4) The prisoner appears to be an acceptable risk for parole based 
on both the prisoner's pre- and post-incarceration record; and
    (5) Service of the minimum term imposed by the court does not appear 
necessary to achieve appropriate punishment and deterrence.
    (d) If the Commission approves a prisoner's request under this 
section, an application for a reduction in the prisoner's minimum term 
shall be forwarded to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia for 
filing with the sentencing court. If the U.S. Attorney objects to the 
Commission's recommendation, the U.S. Attorney shall provide the 
government's objections in writing for consideration by the Commission. 
If, after consideration of the

[[Page 166]]

material submitted, the Commission declines to reconsider its previous 
decision, the U.S. Attorney shall file the application with the 
sentencing court.
    (e) If a prisoner's request under this section is denied by the 
Commission, there shall be a waiting period of two years before the 
Commission will again consider the prisoner's request, absent 
exceptional circumstances.

Sec. 2.77  Medical parole.

    (a) Upon receipt of a report from the institution in which the 
prisoner is confined that the prisoner is terminally ill, or is 
permanently and irreversibly incapacitated by a physical or medical 
condition that is not terminal, the Commission shall determine whether 
or not to release the prisoner on medical parole. Release on medical 
parole may be ordered by the Commission at any time, whether or not the 
prisoner has completed his or her minimum sentence. Consideration for 
medical parole shall be in addition to any other parole for which a 
prisoner may be eligible.
    (b) A prisoner may be granted a medical parole on the basis of 
terminal illness if:
    (1) The institution's medical staff has provided the Commission with 
a reasonable medical judgment that the prisoner is within six months of 
death due to an incurable illness or disease; and
    (2) The Commission finds that:
    (i) The prisoner will not be a danger to himself or others; and
    (ii) Release on parole will not be incompatible with the welfare of 
society.
    (c) A prisoner may be granted a medical parole on the basis of 
permanent and irreversible incapacitation only if the Commission finds 
that:
    (1) The prisoner will not be a danger to himself or others because 
his condition renders him incapable of continued criminal activity; and
    (2) Release on parole will not be incompatible with the welfare of 
society.
    (d) The seriousness of the prisoner's crime shall be considered in 
determining whether or not a medical parole should be granted prior to 
completion of the prisoner's minimum sentence.
    (e) A prisoner, or the prisoner's representative, may apply for a 
medical parole by submitting an application to the institution case 
management staff, who shall forward the application, accompanied by a 
medical report and any recommendations, within 15 days. The Commission 
shall render a decision within 15 days of receiving the application and 
report.
    (f) A prisoner, the prisoner's representative, or the institution 
may request the Commission to reconsider its decision on the basis of 
changed circumstances.
    (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section :
    (1) A prisoner who has been convicted of first degree murder or who 
has been sentenced for a crime committed while armed under D.C. Code 22-
4502, 22-4504(b), or 22-2803, shall not be eligible for medical parole 
(D.C. Code 24-467); and
    (2) A prisoner shall not be eligible for medical parole on the basis 
of a physical or medical condition that existed at the time the prisoner 
was sentenced (D.C. Code 24-462).

<R05>
Sec. 2.78  Geriatric parole.

    (a) Upon receipt of a report from the institution in which the 
prisoner is confined that a prisoner who is at least 65 years of age has 
a chronic infirmity, illness, or disease related to aging, the 
Commission shall determine whether or not to release the prisoner on 
geriatric parole. Release on geriatric parole may be ordered by the 
Commission at any time, whether or not the prisoner has completed his or 
her minimum sentence. Consideration for geriatric parole shall be in 
addition to any other parole for which a prisoner may be eligible.
    (b) A prisoner may be granted a geriatric parole if the Commission 
finds that:
    (1) There is a low risk that the prisoner will commit new crimes; 
and
    (2) The prisoner's release would not be incompatible with the 
welfare of society.
    (c) The seriousness of the prisoner's crime, and the age at which it 
was

[[Page 167]]

committed, shall be considered in determining whether or not a geriatric 
parole should be granted prior to completion of the prisoner's minimum 
sentence.
    (d) A prisoner, or a prisoner's representative, may apply for a 
geriatric parole by submitting an application to the institution case 
management staff, who shall forward the application, accompanied by a 
medical report and any recommendations, within 30 days. The Commission 
shall render a decision within 30 days of receiving the application and 
report.
    (e) In determining whether or not to grant a geriatric parole, the 
Commission shall consider the following factors (D.C. Code 24-465(c)(1)-
(7)):
    (1) Age of the prisoner;
    (2) Severity of illness, disease, or infirmities;
    (3) Comprehensive health evaluation;
    (4) Institutional behavior;
    (5) Level of risk for violence;
    (6) Criminal history; and
    (7) Alternatives to maintaining geriatric long-term prisoners in 
traditional prison settings.
    (f) A prisoner, the prisoner's representative, or the institution, 
may request the Commission to reconsider its decision on the basis of 
changed circumstances.
    (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section:
    (1) A prisoner who has been convicted of first degree murder or who 
has been sentenced for a crime committed while armed under D.C. Code 22-
4502, 22-4504(b), or 22-2803, shall not be eligible for geriatric parole 
(D.C. Code 24-467); and
    (2) A prisoner shall not be eligible for geriatric parole on the 
basis of a physical or medical condition that existed at the time the 
prisoner was sentenced (D.C. Code 24-462).

Sec. 2.79  Good time forfeiture.

    Although a forfeiture of good time will not bar a prisoner from 
receiving a parole hearing, D.C. Code 24-404 permits the Commission to 
parole only those prisoners who have substantially observed the rules of 
the institution. Consequently, the Commission will consider a grant of 
parole for a prisoner with forfeited good time only after a thorough 
review of the circumstances underlying the disciplinary infraction(s). 
The Commission must be satisfied that the prisoner has served a period 
of imprisonment sufficient to outweigh the seriousness of the prisoner's 
misconduct.

Sec. 2.80  Guidelines for D.C. Code offenders.

    (a)(1) Applicability in general. Except as provided below, the 
guidelines in paragraphs (b)-(n) of this section apply at an initial 
hearing or rehearing conducted for any prisoner.
    (2) Reparole decisions. Reparole decisions shall be made in 
accordance with Sec. 2.81.
    (3) Youth offenders. A prisoner sentenced under the Youth 
Rehabilitation Act shall be considered for parole under these guidelines 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except that the prisoner 
shall be given rehearings in accordance with the schedule at Sec. 
2.75(a)(2)(ii) and the prisoner's program achievements shall be 
considered in the parole release decision in accordance with Sec. 
2.106. The guidelines at paragraphs (k)-(m) of this section for awarding 
superior program achievement and subtracting the award in determining 
the total guideline range shall not apply.
    (4) Prisoners considered under the guidelines of the former District 
of Columbia Board of Parole. For a prisoner whose initial hearing was 
held before August 5, 1998, the Commission shall render its decision by 
reference to the guidelines of the former D.C. Board of Parole in effect 
on August 4, 1998. However, when a decision outside such guidelines has 
been made by the Board, or is ordered by the Commission, the Commission 
may determine the appropriateness and extent of the departure by 
comparison with the guidelines of Sec. 2.80. The Commission may also 
correct any error in the calculation of the D.C. Board's guidelines.
    (5) Prisoners given initial hearings under the guidelines in effect 
from August 5, 1998 through December 3, 2000 (the guidelines formerly 
found in 28

[[Page 168]]

CFR 2.80, Appendix to Sec. 2.80 (2000)). For a prisoner given an 
initial hearing under the Sec. 2.80 guidelines in effect from August 5, 
1998 through December 3, 2000, the guidelines in paragraphs (b)-(n) of 
this section shall be applied retroactively subject to the provisions of 
paragraph (o) of this section.
    (b) Guidelines. In determining whether an eligible prisoner should 
be paroled, the Commission shall apply the guidelines set forth in this 
section. The guidelines assign numerical values to pre-and post-
incarceration factors. Decisions outside the guidelines may be made, 
where warranted, pursuant to paragraph (n) of this section.
    (c) Salient factor score and criminal record. The prisoner's Salient 
Factor Score shall be determined by reference to the Salient Factor 
Scoring Manual in Sec. 2.20. The Salient Factor Score is used to assist 
the Commission in assessing the probability that an offender will live 
and remain at liberty without violating the law. The prisoner's record 
of criminal conduct (including the nature and circumstances of the 
current offense) shall be used to assist the Commission in determining 
the probable seriousness of the recidivism that is predicted by the 
Salient Factor Score.
    (d) Disciplinary infractions. The Commission shall assess whether 
the prisoner has been found guilty of committing significant 
disciplinary infractions while under confinement for the current 
offense.
    (e) Program achievement. (1) The Commission shall assess whether the 
prisoner has demonstrated ordinary or superior achievement in the area 
of prison programs, industries, or work assignments while under 
confinement for the current offense. Superior program achievement means 
program achievement that is beyond the level that the prisoner might 
ordinarily be expected to accomplish. Credit for program achievement may 
be granted regardless of whether the guidelines for disciplinary 
infractions have been applied for misconduct during the same period. The 
guidelines in this section presume that the prisoner will have ordinary 
program achievement.
    (2) In the case of a prisoner who has declined to participate in 
institutional programming, a decision in the upper half of the 
applicable guideline range generally will be warranted, except that in 
the case of a prisoner who has a base point score of 3 or less, or who 
has a criminal record involving violence or sexual offenses and who has 
not participated in available programming to address a potential for 
criminal behavior of a violent or sexual nature, a decision above the 
guidelines may be warranted.
    (f) Base point score. Add the applicable points from Categories I-
III of the Point Assignment Table to determine the base point score.

    (g) Definitions and instructions for application of point assignment 
table--(1) Salient factor score means the salient factor score set forth 
at Sec. 2.20.
    (2) High level violence in Category III means any of the following 
offenses--
    (i) Murder;
    (ii) Voluntary manslaughter;
    (iii) Arson of a building in which a person other than the offender 
was present or likely to be present at the time of the offense;
    (iv) Forcible rape or forcible sodomy (first degree sexual abuse);
    (v) Kidnapping, hostage taking, or any armed abduction of a victim 
during a carjacking or other offense;
    (vi) Burglary of a residence while armed with any weapon if a victim 
was in the residence during the offense;
    (vii) Obstruction of justice through violence or threats of 
violence;
    (viii) Any offense involving sexual abuse of a person less than 
sixteen years of age;
    (ix) Mayhem, malicious disfigurement, or any offense defined as 
other violence in paragraph (g)(4) of this section that results in 
serious bodily injury as defined in paragraph (g)(3) of this section;
    (x) Any offense defined as other violence in paragraph (g)(4) of 
this section in which the offender intentionally discharged a firearm;
    (3) Serious bodily injury means bodily injury that involves a 
substantial risk of death, unconsciousness, extreme physical pain, 
protracted and obvious disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment 
of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.
    (4) Other violence means any of the following felony offenses that 
does not qualify as high level violence
    (i) Robbery;
    (ii) Residential burglary;

    (iv) Felony offenses involving a threat, or risk, of bodily harm;
    (v) Felony offenses involving sexual abuse or sexual contact;
    (vi) Involuntary manslaughter (excluding negligent homicide).
    (5) Attempts, conspiracies, and solicitations shall be scored by 
reference to the substantive offense that was the object of the attempt, 
conspiracy, or solicitation; except that Category IIIA shall apply only 
if death actually resulted.
    (6) Current offense means any criminal behavior that is either:
    (i) Reflected in the offense of conviction, or
    (ii) Is not reflected in the offense of conviction but is found by 
the Commission to be related to the offense of conviction (i.e., part of 
the same course of conduct as the offense of conviction). In probation 
violation cases, the current offense includes both the original offense 
and the violation offense, except that the original offense shall be 
scored as a prior conviction (with a prior commitment) rather than as 
part of the current offense, if the prisoner served more than six months 
in prison for the original offense before his probation commenced
    (7) Category IIE applies whenever a firearm is possessed by the 
offender during, or is used by the offender to commit, any offense that 
is not scored under Category II(A-D). Category IIE also applies when the 
current offense is felony unlawful possession of a firearm and there is 
no other current offense. Possession for purposes of Category IIE 
includes constructive possession.
    (8) Category IIIA applies if the death of a victim is:
    (i) Caused by the offender, or
    (ii) Caused by an accomplice and the killing was planned or approved 
by the offender in furtherance of a joint criminal venture.
    (h) Determining the base guideline range. Determine the base 
guideline range for adult prisoners from the following table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) Months to parole eligibility. Determine the total number of 
months until parole eligibility.
    (j) Guideline range for disciplinary infractions. Determine the 
applicable guideline range from Sec. 2.36 for any significant 
disciplinary infractions since

[[Page 170]]

the beginning of confinement on the current offense in the case of an 
initial hearing, and since the last hearing in the case of a rehearing. 
If there are no significant disciplinary infractions, this step is not 
applicable.
    (k) Guidelines for superior program achievement. If superior program 
achievement is found, the award for superior program achievement shall 
be one-third of the number of months during which the prisoner 
demonstrated superior program achievement. The award is determined on 
the basis of all time in confinement on the current offense in the case 
of an initial hearing, and on the basis of time in confinement since the 
last hearing in the case of a rehearing. If superior program achievement 
is not found, this step is not applicable.
    Note: When superior program achievement is found, it is presumed 
that the award will be based on the total number of months since the 
beginning of confinement on the current offense in the case of an 
initial hearing, or since the last hearing in the case of a rehearing. 
Where, however, the Commission determines that the prisoner did not have 
superior program achievement during the entire period, it may base its 
decision solely on the number of months during which the prisoner had 
superior program achievement.
    (l) Determining the total guideline range at an initial hearing. At 
an initial hearing
    (1) Add together the minimum of the base point guideline range (from 
paragraph (h) of this section), the number of months required by the 
prisoner's parole eligibility date (from (i) of this section), and the 
minimum of the guideline range for disciplinary infractions, if 
applicable (from paragraph (j) of this section). Then subtract the award 
for superior program achievement, if applicable (from paragraph (k) of 
this section). The result is the minimum of the Total Guideline Range.
    (2) Add together the maximum of the base point guideline range (from 
paragraph (h) of this section), the number of months required by the 
prisoner's parole eligibility date (from paragraph (i) of this section), 
and the maximum of the guideline range for disciplinary infractions, if 
applicable (from paragraph (j) of this section). Then subtract the award 
for superior program achievement, if applicable (from paragraph (k) of 
this section). The result is the maximum of the Total Guideline Range.
    (m) Determining the total guideline range at a reconsideration 
hearing. At a reconsideration hearing--
    (1) Add together the minimum of the Total Guideline Range from the 
previous hearing, and the minimum of the guideline range for 
disciplinary infractions since the previous hearing, if applicable (from 
paragraph (j) of this section). Then subtract the award for superior 
program achievement, if applicable (from paragraph (k) of this section). 
The result is the minimum of the Total Guideline Range for the current 
hearing.
    (2) Add together the maximum of the Total Guideline Range from the 
previous hearing, and the maximum of the guideline range for 
disciplinary infractions since the previous hearing, if applicable (from 
paragraph (j) of this section). Then subtract the award for superior 
program achievement since the previous hearing, if applicable (from 
paragraph (k) of this section). The result is the maximum of the Total 
Guideline Range for the current hearing.
    (n) Decisions outside the guidelines. (1) The Commission may, in 
unusual circumstances, grant or deny parole to a prisoner 
notwithstanding the guidelines. Unusual circumstances are case-specific 
factors that are not fully taken into account in the guidelines, and 
that are relevant to the grant or denial of parole. In such cases, the 
Commission shall specify in the notice of action the specific factors 
that it relied on in departing from the applicable guideline or 
guideline range. If the prisoner is deemed to be a poorer or more 
serious risk than the guidelines indicate, the Commission shall 
determine what Base Point Score would more appropriately fit the 
prisoner's case, and shall render its initial and rehearing decisions as 
if the prisoner had that higher Base Point Score. It is to be noted 
that, in some cases, an extreme level of risk presented by the prisoner 
may make it inappropriate for the Commission to contemplate a parole at 
any hearing without a significant change in the prisoner's 
circumstances.

[[Page 171]]

    (2) Factors that may warrant a decision above the guidelines 
include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (i) Poorer parole risk than indicated by salient factor score. The 
offender is a poorer parole risk than indicated by the salient factor 
score because of--
    (A) Unusually persistent failure under supervision (pretrial 
release, probation, or parole);
    (B) Unusually persistent history of criminally related substance 
(drug or alcohol) abuse and resistance to treatment efforts; or
    (C) Unusually extensive prior record (sufficient to make the 
offender a poorer risk than the ``poor'' prognosis category).
    (ii) More serious parole risk. The offender is a more serious parole 
risk than indicated by the total point score because of--
    (A) Prior record of violence more extensive or serious than that 
taken into account in the guidelines;
    (B) Current offense demonstrates extraordinary criminal 
sophistication, criminal professionalism in the employment of violence 
or threats of violence, or leadership role in instigating others to 
commit a serious offense;
    (C) Unusual cruelty to the victim (beyond that accounted for by 
scoring the offense as high level violence), or predation upon extremely 
vulnerable victim;
    (D) Unusual propensity to inflict unprovoked and potentially 
homicidal violence, as demonstrated by the circumstances of the current 
offense; or
    (E) Additional serious offense(s) committed after (or while on bond 
or fugitive status from) current offense that show unusual capacity for 
sustained, repeated violent criminal activity.
    (3) Factors that may warrant a decision below the guidelines 
include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (i) Better parole risk than indicated by salient factor score. The 
offender is a better parole risk than indicated by the salient factor 
score because of (applicable only to offenders who are not already in 
the very good risk category)--
    (A) A prior criminal record resulting exclusively from minor 
offenses;
    (B) A substantial crime-free period in the community for which 
credit is not already given on the Salient Factor Score;
    (C) A change in the availability of community resources leading to a 
better parole prognosis;
    (ii) Other factors:
    (A) Unusually lengthy period of incarceration on the minimum 
sentence (in relation to the seriousness of the offense and prior 
record) that warrants an initial parole determination as if the offender 
were being considered at a rehearing;
    (B) Substantial period in custody on other sentence(s) sufficient to 
warrant a finding in paragraph (n)(3) of this section; or
    (C) Clearly exceptional program achievement.
    (o) Conversion rules for retroactive application of the Sec. 2.80 
guidelines. When the guidelines of this section are retroactively 
applied, the following conversion rules shall be used.
    (1) If the prisoner previously had any points added for negative 
institutional behavior under the guidelines formerly found in the 
Appendix to Sec. 2.80 (2000) (i.e., the guidelines in effect from 
August 5, 1998 through December 3, 2000), the total guideline range 
shall be increased by the lesser of:
    (i) The guideline range from Sec. 2.36 found to apply to the prior 
misconduct; or
    (ii) The range of months obtained when the number of points 
previously added for negative institutional behavior is multiplied by 
the rehearing range applicable under the guidelines in the former 
Appendix to Sec. 2.80 (e.g., if two points previously were added for 
misconduct and the applicable rehearing range was 18-24 months, then 36-
48 months (2 x 18-24) would be added).
    (2) If negative institutional behavior previously was sanctioned by 
the application of a guideline range at Sec. 2.36, the total guideline 
range shall be increased by that range for that behavior.
    (3) If the prisoner previously had an extra point deducted for 
superior program achievement (as opposed to ordinary program 
achievement) under the guidelines in the former Appendix to Sec. 2.80, 
the total guideline range shall be decreased by the rehearing guideline 
range applicable under the Appendix to Sec. 2.80 guidelines (e.g., if 
an extra point

[[Page 172]]

previously was subtracted for superior (not ordinary) program 
achievement and the applicable rehearing range was 18-24 months, then 
18-24 months would be subtracted).
    (4) Misconduct or superior program achievement since the last 
hearing shall be considered in accordance with the guidelines of this 
section.

Sec. 2.81  Reparole decisions.

    (a) If the prisoner is not serving a new, parolable D.C. Code 
sentence, the Commission's decision to grant or deny reparole on the 
parole violation term shall be made by reference to the reparole 
guidelines at Sec. 2.21. The Commission shall establish a presumptive 
or effective release date pursuant to Sec. 2.12(b), and conduct interim 
hearings pursuant to Sec. 2.14.
    (b) If the prisoner is eligible for parole on a new D.C. Code felony 
sentence that has been aggregated with the prisoner's parole violation 
term, the Commission shall make a decision to grant or deny parole on 
the basis of the aggregate sentence, and in accordance with the 
guidelines at Sec. 2.80.
    (c) If the prisoner is eligible for parole on a new D.C. Code felony 
sentence but the prisoner's parole violation term has not commenced 
(i.e., the warrant has not been executed), the Commission shall make a 
single parole/reparole decision by applying the guidelines at Sec. 
2.80. The Commission shall establish an appropriate date for the 
execution of the outstanding warrant in order for the guidelines at 
Sec. 2.80 to be satisfied. In cases where the execution of the warrant 
will not result in the aggregation of the new sentence and the parole 
violation term, the Commission shall make parole and reparole decisions 
that are consistent with the guidelines at Sec. 2.80.
    (d) All reparole hearings shall be conducted according to the 
procedures set forth in Sec. 2.72, and may be combined with the holding 
of a revocation hearing if the prisoner's parole has not previously been 
revoked. If the prisoner is serving a period of imprisonment imposed 
upon revocation of his parole by the D.C. Board of Parole, the 
Commission shall consider all available and relevant information 
concerning the prisoner's conduct while on parole, including any 
allegations of criminal or administrative violations left unresolved by 
the Board, pursuant to the procedures applicable to initial hearings 
under Sec. 2.72 and Sec. 2.19(c). The same procedures shall apply in 
the case of any new information concerning criminal or administrative 
violations of parole presented to the Commission for the first time 
following the conclusion of a revocation proceeding that resulted in the 
revocation of parole and the return of the offender to prison.

Sec. 2.82  Effective date of parole.

    (a) An effective date of parole may be granted up to nine months 
from the date of the hearing.
    (b) Except in the case of a medical or geriatric parole, a parole 
that is granted prior to the completion of the prisoner's minimum term 
shall not become effective until the prisoner becomes eligible for 
release on parole.

<R05>
Sec. 2.83  Release planning.

    (a) All grants of parole shall be conditioned on the development of 
a suitable release plan and the approval of that plan by the Commission. 
A parole certificate shall not be issued until a release plan has been 
approved by the Commission. In the case of mandatory release, the 
Commission shall review each prisoner's release plan to determine 
whether the imposition of any special conditions should be ordered to 
promote the prisoner's rehabilitation and protect the public safety.
    (b) If a parole date has been granted, but the prisoner has not 
submitted a proposed release plan, the appropriate correctional or 
supervision staff shall assist the prisoner in formulating a release 
plan for investigation.
    (c) After investigation by a Supervision Officer, the proposed 
release plan shall be submitted to the Commission 30 days prior to the 
prisoner's parole or mandatory release date.

[[Page 173]]

    (d) A Commissioner may retard a parole date for purposes of release 
planning for up to 120 days without a hearing. If efforts to formulate 
an acceptable release plan prove futile by the expiration of such 
period, or if the Offender Supervision staff reports that there are 
insufficient resources to provide effective supervision for the 
individual in question, the Commission shall be promptly notified in a 
detailed report. If the Commission does not order the prisoner to be 
paroled, the Commission shall suspend the grant of parole and conduct a 
reconsideration hearing on the next available docket. Following such 
reconsideration hearing, the Commission may deny parole if it finds that 
the release of the prisoner without a suitable plan would fail to meet 
the criteria set forth in Sec. 2.73. However, if the prisoner 
subsequently presents an acceptable release plan, the Commission may 
reopen the case and issue a new grant of parole.
    (e) The following shall be considered in the formulation of a 
suitable release plan:
    (1) Evidence that the parolee will have an acceptable residence;
    (2) Evidence that the parolee will be legitimately employed as soon 
as released; provided, that in special circumstances, the requirement 
for immediate employment upon release may be waived by the Commission;
    (3) Evidence that the necessary aftercare will be available for 
parolees who are ill, or who have any other demonstrable problems for 
which special care is necessary, such as hospital facilities or other 
domiciliary care; and
    (4) Evidence of availability of, and acceptance in, a community 
program in those cases where parole has been granted conditioned upon 
acceptance or participation in a specific community program.


<R05>
Sec. 2.84  Release to other jurisdictions.

    The Commission, in its discretion, may parole any prisoner to live 
and remain in a jurisdiction other than the District of Columbia.


<R05>
Sec. 2.85  Conditions of release.

    (a) General conditions of release. (1) The conditions set forth in 
Sec. 2.204(a)(3)-(6) apply for the reasons set forth in Sec. 
2.204(a)(1). These conditions are printed on the certificate of release 
issued to each releasee.
    (2)(i) The refusal of a prisoner who has been granted a parole date 
to sign the certificate of release (or any other document necessary to 
fulfill a condition of release) constitutes withdrawal of that 
prisoner's application for parole as of the date of refusal. To be 
considered for parole again, the prisoner must reapply for parole 
consideration.
    (ii) A prisoner who is released to supervision through good-time 
deduction who refuses to sign the certificate of release is nevertheless 
bound by the conditions set forth in that certificate.
    (b) Special conditions of release. The Commission may impose a 
condition other than one of the general conditions of release if the 
Commission determines that such condition is necessary to protect the 
public from further crimes by the releasee and provide adequate 
supervision of the releasee. Examples of special conditions of release 
that the Commission frequently imposes are found at Sec. 2.204(b)(2).
    (c) Changing conditions of release. The provisions of Sec. 2.204(c) 
apply.
    (d) Application of release conditions to absconder. The provisions 
of Sec. 2.204(d) apply.
    (e) Supervision officer guidance. The provisions of Sec. 2.204(f) 
apply.
    (f) Definitions. For purposes of this section--
    (1) The terms supervision officer, domestic violence crime, approved 
offender-rehabilitation program and firearm, as used in Sec. 2.204, 
have the meanings given those terms by Sec. 2.204(g);
    (2) The term releasee, as used in this section and in Sec. 2.204, 
means a person convicted of an offense under the District of Columbia 
Code who has been released on parole or released through good-time 
deduction; and
    (3) The term certificate of release, as used in this section and in 
Sec. 2.204, means the certificate of parole or mandatory release 
delivered to the releasee under Sec. 2.86.

[68 FR 41700, July 15, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 2.86  Release on parole; rescission for misconduct.

    (a) When a parole effective date has been set, actual release on 
parole on

[[Page 174]]

that date shall be conditioned upon the individual maintaining a good 
conduct record in the institution or prerelease program to which the 
prisoner has been assigned.
    (b) The Commission may reconsider any grant of parole prior to the 
prisoner's actual release on parole, and may advance or retard a parole 
effective date or rescind a parole date previously granted based upon 
the receipt of any new and significant information concerning the 
prisoner, including disciplinary infractions. The Commission may retard 
a parole date for disciplinary infractions (e.g., to permit the use of 
graduated sanctions) for up to 120 days without a hearing, in addition 
to any retardation ordered under Sec. 2.83(d).
    (c) If a parole effective date is rescinded for disciplinary 
infractions, an appropriate sanction shall be determined by reference to 
Sec. 2.36.
    (d) After a prisoner has been granted a parole effective date, the 
institution shall notify the Commission of any serious disciplinary 
infractions committed by the prisoner prior to the date of actual 
release. In such case, the prisoner shall not be released until the 
institution has been advised that no change has been made in the 
Commission's order granting parole.
    (e) A grant of parole becomes operative upon the authorized delivery 
of a certificate of parole to the prisoner, and the signing of that 
certificate by the prisoner, who thereafter becomes a parolee.

<R05>
Sec. 2.87  Mandatory release.

    (a) When a prisoner has been denied parole at the initial hearing 
and all subsequent considerations, or parole consideration is expressly 
precluded by statute, the prisoner shall be released at the expiration 
of his or her imposed sentence less the time deducted for any good time 
allowances provided by statute.
    (b) Any prisoner having served his or her term or terms less 
deduction for good time shall, upon release, be deemed to be released on 
parole until the expiration of the maximum term or terms for which he or 
she was sentenced, except that if the offense of conviction was 
committed before April 11, 1987, such expiration date shall be less one 
hundred eighty (180) days. Every provision of these rules relating to an 
individual on parole shall be deemed to include individuals on mandatory 
release.


<R05>
Sec. 2.88  Confidentiality of parole records.

    (a) Consistent with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)), the 
contents of parole records shall be confidential and shall not be 
disclosed outside the Commission except as provided in paragraphs (b) 
and (c) of this section.
    (b) Information that is subject to release to the general public 
without the consent of the prisoner shall be limited to the information 
specified in Sec. 2.37.
    (c) Information other than as described in Sec. 2.37 may be 
disclosed without the consent of the prisoner only pursuant to the 
provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)) and Sec. 2.56.

    Any order entered by the Board of Parole of the District of Columbia 
shall be accorded the status of an order of the Parole Commission unless 
duly

[[Page 175]]

reconsidered and changed by the Commission at a regularly scheduled 
hearing. It shall not constitute grounds for reopening a case that the 
prisoner is subject to an order of the Board of Parole that fails to 
conform to a provision of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 2.91  Supervision responsibility.

    (a) Pursuant to D.C. Code 24-133(c), the District of Columbia Court 
Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA) shall provide 
supervision, through qualified Supervision Officers, for all D.C. Code 
parolees and mandatory releasees under the jurisdiction of the 
Commission who are released to the District of Columbia. Individuals 
under the jurisdiction of the Commission who are released to districts 
outside the D.C. metropolitan area, or who are serving mixed U.S. and 
D.C. Code sentences, shall be supervised by a U.S. Probation Officer 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3655.
    (b) A parolee or mandatory releasee may be transferred to a new 
district of supervision with the permission of the supervision offices 
of both the transferring and receiving district, provided such transfer 
is not contrary to instructions from the Commission.

Sec. 2.92  Jurisdiction of the Commission.

    (a) Pursuant to D.C. Code 24-221.03(a) and 24-405, the jurisdiction 
of the Commission over a parolee shall expire on the date of expiration 
of the maximum term or terms for which he was sentenced, subject to the 
provisions of this subpart relating to warrant issuance, time in 
absconder status, and the forfeiture of credit for time on parole in the 
case of revocation.
    (b) The parole of any parolee shall run concurrently with the period 
of parole, probation, or supervised release under any other Federal, 
State, or local sentence.
    (c) Upon the expiration of the parolee's maximum term as specified 
in the release certificate, the parolee's Supervision Officer shall 
issue a certificate of discharge to such parolee and to such other 
agencies as may be appropriate.
    (d) A termination of parole pursuant to an order of revocation shall 
not affect the Commission's jurisdiction to grant and enforce any 
further periods of parole, up to the expiration of the offender's 
maximum term.

Sec. 2.93  Travel approval.

    (a) A parolee's Supervision Officer may approve travel outside the 
district of supervision without approval of the Commission in the 
following situations:
    (1) Vacation trips not to exceed thirty days.
    (2) Trips, not to exceed thirty days, to investigate reasonably 
certain employment possibilities.
    (3) Recurring travel across a district boundary, not to exceed fifty 
miles outside the district, for purpose of employment, shopping, or 
recreation.
    (b) Specific advance approval by the Commission is required for all 
foreign travel, employment requiring recurring travel more than fifty 
miles outside the district, and vacation travel outside the district of 
supervision exceeding thirty days. A request for such permission shall 
be in writing and must demonstrate a substantial need for such travel.
    (c) A special condition imposed by the Commission prohibiting 
certain travel shall apply instead of any general rules relating to 
travel as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) The district of supervision for a parolee under the supervision 
of the D.C. Community Supervision Office of CSOSA shall be the District 
of Columbia, except that for the purpose of travel permission under this 
section the district of supervision will include the D.C. metropolitan 
area as defined in the certificate of parole.


<R05>
Sec. 2.94  Supervision reports to Commission.

    An initial supervision report to confirm the satisfactory initial 
progress of the parolee shall be submitted to the Commission 90 days 
after the parolee's release from prison, by the officer responsible for 
the parolee's supervision. A regular supervision report shall be 
submitted to the Commission by the

[[Page 176]]

officer responsible for the supervision of the parolee after the 
completion of 12 months of continuous community supervision and annually 
thereafter. The Supervision Officer shall submit such additional reports 
and information concerning both the parolee, and the enforcement of the 
conditions of the parolee's supervision, as the Commission may direct. 
All reports shall be submitted according to the format established by 
the Commission.

    Editorial Note: At 67 FR 57946, Sept. 13, 2002, the first sentence 
of paragraph (a) of Sec. 2.94 was removed. However, paragraph (a) of 
Sec. 2.94 did not exist in the 2001 Edition of that volume.


<R05>
Sec. 2.95  Release from active supervision.

    (a) The Commission, in its discretion, may release a parolee or 
mandatory releasee from further supervision prior to the expiration of 
the maximum term or terms for which he or she was sentenced.
    (b) Two years after release on supervision, and at least annually 
thereafter, the Commission shall review the status of each parolee to 
determine the need for continued supervision. In calculating such two-
year period there shall not be included any period of release on parole 
prior to the most recent release, nor any period served in confinement 
on any other sentence. A review shall also be conducted whenever release 
from supervision is specially recommended by the parolee's Supervision 
Officer.
    (c) In determining whether to grant release from supervision, the 
Commission shall apply the following guidelines, provided that case-
specific factors do not indicate a need for continued supervision:
    (1) For a parolee originally classified in the very good risk 
category and whose current offense did not involve violence, release 
from supervision may be ordered after two continuous years of incident-
free parole in the community;
    (2) For a parolee originally classified in the very good risk 
category and whose current offense involved violence other than high 
level violence, release from supervision may be ordered after three 
continuous years of incident-free parole in the community;
    (3) For a parolee originally classified in the very good risk 
category and whose current offense involved high level violence (without 
death of victim resulting), release from supervision may be ordered 
after four continuous years of incident-free parole in the community;
    (4) For a parolee originally classified in other than the very good 
risk category, whose current offense did not involve violence, and whose 
prior record includes not more than one episode of felony violence, 
release from supervision may be ordered after three continuous years of 
incident-free parole in the community;
    (5) For a parolee originally classified in other than the very good 
risk category, and whose current offense involved violence other than 
high level violence, or whose prior record includes two or more episodes 
of felony violence, release from supervision may be ordered after four 
continuous years of incident-free parole in the community;
    (6) For a parolee who was originally classified in other than the 
very good risk category and whose current offense involved high level 
violence (without death of victim resulting), release from supervision 
may be ordered after five continuous years of incident-free parole in 
the community;
    (7) For any parolee whose current offense involved high level 
violence with death of victim resulting, release from supervision may be 
ordered only upon a case-specific finding that, by reason of age, 
infirmity, or other compelling factors, the parolee is unlikely to be a 
threat to the public safety.
    (d) Decisions to release from supervision prior to completion of the 
periods specified in this section may be made where it appears that the 
parolee is a better risk than indicated by the salient factor score (if 
originally classified in other than the very good risk category), or a 
less serious risk than indicated by a violent current offense or prior 
record (if any). However, release from supervision prior to the 
completion of two years of incident-free supervision will not be granted 
in any case unless case-specific factors clearly indicate that continued 
supervision would be counterproductive to the parolee's rehabilitation.

[[Page 177]]

    (e) Except as provided in Sec. 2.99(c), cases with pending criminal 
charge(s) shall not be released from supervision until the disposition 
of such charge(s) is known. The term ``incident-free'' parole shall 
include both any reported violations, and any arrest or law enforcement 
investigation that raises a reasonable doubt as to whether the parolee 
has been able to refrain from law violations while on parole.


<R05>
Sec. 2.96  Order of release.

    (a) When the Commission approves a recommendation for release from 
active supervision, a written order of release from supervision shall be 
issued and a copy thereof shall be delivered to the releasee.
    (b) Each order of release shall state that the conditions of the 
releasee's parole are waived, except that it shall remain a condition 
that the releasee shall not violate any law or engage in any conduct 
that might bring discredit to the parole system, under penalty of 
possible withdrawal of the order of release or revocation of parole.
    (c) An order of release from supervision shall not release the 
parolee from the custody of the Attorney General or from the 
jurisdiction of the Commission before the expiration of the term or 
terms being served.


<R05>
Sec. 2.97  Withdrawal of order of release.

    If, after an order of release from supervision has been issued by 
the Commission, and prior to the expiration date of the sentence(s) 
being served, the parolee commits any new criminal offense or engages in 
any conduct that might bring discredit to the parole system, the 
Commission may, in its discretion, do any of the following:
    (a) Issue a summons or warrant to commence the revocation process;
    (b) Withdraw the order of release from supervision and return the 
parolee to active supervision; or
    (c) Impose any special conditions to the order of release from 
supervision.


<R05>
Sec. 2.98  Summons to appear or warrant for retaking of parolee.

    (a) If a parolee is alleged to have violated the conditions of his 
release, and satisfactory evidence thereof is presented, the Commission 
or a member thereof may:
    (1) Issue a summons requiring the offender to appear for a probable 
cause hearing or local revocation hearing; or
    (2) Issue a warrant for the apprehension and return of the offender 
to custody.
    (b) A summons or warrant under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may 
be issued or withdrawn only by the Commission, or a member thereof.
    (c) Any summons or warrant under this section shall be issued as 
soon as practicable after the alleged violation is reported to the 
Commission, except when delay is deemed necessary. Issuance of a summons 
or warrant may be withheld until the frequency or seriousness of the 
violations, in the opinion of the Commission, requires such issuance. In 
the case of any parolee who is charged with a criminal offense and who 
is awaiting disposition of such charge, issuance of a summons or warrant 
may be:
    (1) Temporarily withheld;
    (2) Issued by the Commission and held in abeyance;
    (3) Issued by the Commission and a detainer lodged with the 
custodial authority; or
    (4) Issued for the retaking of the parolee.
    (d) A summons or warrant may be issued only within the prisoner's 
maximum term or terms, except that in the case of a prisoner who has 
been mandatorily released from a sentence imposed for an offense 
committed before April 11, 1987, such summons or warrant may be issued 
only within the maximum term or terms less one hundred eighty days. A 
summons or warrant shall be considered issued when signed and either:
    (1) Placed in the mail; or
    (2) Sent by electronic transmission to the appropriate law 
enforcement authority.
    (e) The issuance of a warrant under this section operates to bar the 
expiration of the parolee's sentence. Such warrant maintains the 
Commission's jurisdiction to retake the parolee either before or after 
the normal expiration date of the sentence and to reach a final decision 
as to the revocation of

[[Page 178]]

parole and the forfeiture of time pursuant to D.C. Code 24-406(a).
    (f) A summons or warrant issued pursuant to this section shall be 
accompanied by a warrant application (or other notice) stating:
    (1) The charges against the parolee;
    (2) The specific reports and other documents upon which the 
Commission intends to rely in determining whether a violation occurred 
and whether to revoke parole;
    (3) Notice of the Commission's intent, if the parolee is arrested 
within the District of Columbia, to hold a probable cause hearing within 
five days of the parolee's arrest;
    (4) A statement of the purpose of the probable cause hearing;
    (5) The days of the week on which the Commission regularly holds its 
dockets of probable cause hearings at the Central Detention Facility;
    (6) The parolee's procedural rights in the revocation process; and
    (7) The possible actions that the Commission may take.
    (g) Every warrant issued by the Board of Parole of the District of 
Columbia prior to August 5, 2000, shall be deemed to be a valid warrant 
of the U.S. Parole Commission unless withdrawn by the Commission. Such 
warrant shall be executed as provided in Sec. 2.99, and every offender 
retaken upon such warrant shall be treated for all purposes as if 
retaken upon a warrant issued by the Commission.

or any officer or designated civilian employee of the Metropolitan 
Police Department of the District of Columbia, to whom a warrant is 
delivered, shall execute such warrant by taking the parolee and 
returning him to the custody of the Attorney General.
    (b) Upon the arrest of the parolee, the officer executing the 
warrant shall deliver to the parolee a copy of the warrant application 
(or other notice provided by the Commission) containing the information 
described in Sec. 2.98 (f).
    (c) If execution of the warrant is delayed pending disposition of 
local charges, for further investigation, or for some other purpose, the 
parolee is to be continued under supervision by the Supervision Officer 
until the normal expiration of the sentence, or until the warrant is 
executed, whichever first occurs. Monthly supervision reports are to be 
submitted, and the parolee must continue to abide by all the conditions 
of release.
    (d) If any other warrant for the arrest of the parolee has been 
executed or is outstanding at the time the Commission's warrant is 
executed, the arresting officer may, within 72 hours of executing the 
Commission's warrant, release the parolee to such other warrant and 
lodge the Commission's warrant as a detainer, voiding the execution 
thereof, if such action is consistent with the instructions of the 
Commission. In other cases, a parolee may be released from an executed 
warrant whenever the Commission finds such action necessary to serve the 
ends of justice.
    (e) A summons to appear at a probable cause hearing or revocation 
hearing shall be served upon the parolee in person by delivering to the 
parolee a copy of the summons and the application therefor. Service 
shall be made by any Federal or District of Columbia officer authorized 
to serve criminal process and certification of such service shall be 
returned to the Commission.
    (f) Official notification of the issuance of a Commission warrant 
shall authorize any law enforcement officer within the United States to 
hold the parolee in custody until the warrant can be executed in 
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.

Sec. 2.100  Warrant placed as detainer and dispositional review.

    (a) When a parolee is in the custody of other law enforcement 
authorities, or is serving a new sentence of imprisonment imposed for a 
crime committed while on parole or for a violation of

[[Page 179]]

some other form of community supervision, a parole violation warrant may 
be lodged against him as a detainer.
    (b) If the parolee is serving a new sentence of imprisonment, and is 
eligible and has applied for parole under the Commission's jurisdiction, 
a dispositional revocation hearing shall be scheduled simultaneously 
with the initial hearing on the new sentence. In such cases, the warrant 
shall not be executed except upon final order of the Commission 
following such hearing, as provided in Sec. 2.81(c). In any other 
cases, the detainer shall be reviewed on the record pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) If the parolee is serving a new sentence of imprisonment that 
does not include eligibility for parole under the Commission's 
jurisdiction, the Commission shall review the detainer upon the request 
of the parolee. Following such review, the Commission may:
    (1) Withdraw the detainer and order reinstatement of the parolee to 
supervision upon release from custody, or close the case if the 
expiration date has passed.
    (2) Order a dispositional revocation hearing to be conducted by a 
hearing examiner or an official designated by the Commission at the 
institution in which the parolee is confined. In such case, the warrant 
shall not be executed except upon final order of the Commission 
following such hearing.
    (3) Let the detainer stand until the new sentence is completed. 
Following the release of the parolee, and the execution of the 
Commission's warrant, an institutional revocation hearing shall be 
conducted after the parolee is returned to federal custody.
    (d) Dispositional revocation hearings pursuant to this section shall 
be conducted in accordance with the provisions at Sec. 2.103 governing 
institutional revocation hearings, except that a hearing conducted at a 
state or local facility may be conducted by a hearing examiner, hearing 
examiner panel, or other official designated by the Commission. 
Following a revocation hearing conducted pursuant to this section, the 
Commission may take any action specified in Sec. 2.105.
    (1) The date the violation term commences is the date the 
Commission's warrant is executed. It shall be the policy of the 
Commission that the parolee's violation term (i.e., the unexpired term 
that remained to be served at the time the parolee was last released on 
parole) shall start to run only upon his release from the confinement 
portion of the sentence for the new offense, or the date of reparole 
granted pursuant to this subpart, whichever comes first.
    (2) A parole violator whose parole is revoked shall be given credit 
for all time in confinement resulting from any new offense or violation 
that is considered by the Commission as a basis for revocation, but 
solely for the limited purpose of satisfying the time ranges in the 
reparole guidelines at Sec. 2.81. The computation of the prisoner's 
sentence, and forfeiture of time on parole pursuant to D.C. Code 24-
406(a), is not affected by such guideline credit.

<R05>
Sec. 2.101  Probable cause hearing and determination.

    (a) Hearing. A parolee who is retaken and held in custody in the 
District of Columbia on a warrant issued by the Commission, and who has 
not been convicted of a new crime, shall be given a probable cause 
hearing by an examiner of the Commission no later than five days from 
the date of such retaking. A parolee who is retaken and held in custody 
outside the District of Columbia, but within the Washington DC 
metropolitan area, and who has not been convicted of a new crime, shall 
be given a probable cause hearing by an examiner of the Commission 
within five days of the parolee's arrival at a facility where probable 
cause hearings are conducted. The purpose of a probable cause hearing is 
to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the parolee 
has violated parole as charged, and if so, whether a local or 
institutional revocation hearing should be conducted. If the examiner 
finds probable cause, the examiner shall schedule a final revocation 
hearing to be held within 65 days of such parolee's arrest.
    (b) Notice and opportunity to postpone hearing. Prior to the 
commencement of each docket of probable cause hearings in the District 
of Columbia, a list of

[[Page 180]]

the parolees who are scheduled for probable cause hearings, together 
with a copy of the warrant application for each parolee, shall be sent 
to the D.C. Public Defender Service. At or before the probable cause 
hearing, the parolee (or the parolee's attorney) may submit a written 
request that the hearing be postponed for any period up to thirty days, 
and the Commission shall ordinarily grant such requests. Prior to the 
commencement of the probable cause hearing, the examiner shall advise 
the parolee that the parolee may accept representation by the attorney 
from the D.C. Public Defender Service who is assigned to that docket, 
waive the assistance of an attorney at the probable cause hearing, or 
have the probable cause hearing postponed in order to obtain another 
attorney and/or witnesses on his behalf. In addition, the parolee may 
request the Commission to require the attendance of adverse witnesses 
(i.e., witnesses who have given information upon which revocation may be 
based) at a postponed probable cause hearing. Such adverse witnesses may 
be required to attend either a postponed probable cause hearing, or a 
combined postponed probable cause and local revocation hearing, provided 
the parolee meets the requirements of Sec. 2.102(a) for a local 
revocation hearing. The parolee shall also be given notice of the time 
and place of any postponed probable cause hearing.
    (c) Review of the charges. At the beginning of the probable cause 
hearing, the examiner shall ascertain that the notice required by Sec. 
2.99 (b) has been given to the parolee. The examiner shall then review 
the violation charges with the parolee and shall apprise the parolee of 
the evidence that has been submitted in support of the charges. The 
examiner shall ascertain whether the parolee admits or denies each 
charge listed on the warrant application (or other notice of charges), 
and shall offer the parolee an opportunity to rebut or explain the 
allegations contained in the evidence giving rise to each charge. The 
examiner shall also receive the statements of any witnesses and 
documentary evidence that may be presented by the parolee. At a 
postponed probable cause hearing, the examiner shall also permit the 
parolee to confront and cross-examine any adverse witnesses in 
attendance, unless good cause is found for not allowing confrontation. 
Whenever a probable cause hearing is postponed to secure the appearance 
of adverse witnesses, the Commission will ordinarily order a combined 
probable cause and local revocation hearing as provided in paragraph (i) 
of this section.
    (d) Probable cause determination. At the conclusion of the probable 
cause hearing, the examiner shall determine whether probable cause 
exists to believe that the parolee has violated parole as charged, and 
shall so inform the parolee. The examiner shall then take either of the 
following actions:
    (1) If the examiner determines that no probable cause exists for any 
violation charge, the examiner shall order that the parolee be released 
from the custody of the warrant and either reinstated to parole, or 
discharged from supervision if the parolee's sentence has expired.
    (2) If the hearing examiner determines that probable cause exists on 
any violation charge, and the parolee has requested (and is eligible 
for) a local revocation hearing in the District of Columbia as provided 
by Sec. 2.102 (a), the examiner shall schedule a local revocation 
hearing for a date that is within 65 days of the parolee's arrest. After 
the probable cause hearing, the parolee (or the parolee's attorney) may 
submit a written request for a postponement. Such postponements will 
normally be granted if the request is received no later than fifteen 
days before the date of the revocation hearing. A request for a 
postponement that is received by the Commission less than fifteen days 
before the scheduled date of the revocation hearing will be granted only 
for a compelling reason. The parolee (or the parolee's attorney) may 
also request, in writing, a hearing date that is earlier than the date 
scheduled by the examiner, and the Commission will accommodate such 
request if practicable.
    (e) Institutional revocation hearing. If the parolee is not eligible 
for a local revocation hearing as provided by

[[Page 181]]

Sec. 2.102 (a), or has requested to be transferred to an institution 
for his revocation hearing, the Commission will request the Bureau of 
Prisons to designate the parolee to an appropriate institution, and an 
institutional revocation hearing shall be scheduled for a date that is 
within ninety days of the parolee's retaking.
    (f) Digest of the probable cause hearing. At the conclusion of the 
probable cause hearing, the examiner shall prepare a digest summarizing 
the evidence presented at the hearing, the responses of the parolee, and 
the examiner's findings as to probable cause.
    (g) Release notwithstanding probable cause. Notwithstanding a 
finding of probable cause, the Commission may order the parolee's 
reinstatement to supervision or release pending further proceedings, if 
it determines that:
    (1) Continuation of revocation proceedings is not warranted despite 
the finding of probable cause; or
    (2) Incarceration pending further revocation proceedings is not 
warranted by the frequency or seriousness of the alleged violation(s), 
and the parolee is neither likely to fail to appear for further 
proceedings, nor is a danger to himself or others.
    (h) Conviction as probable cause. Conviction of any crime committed 
subsequent to release by a parolee shall constitute probable cause for 
the purposes of this section, and no probable cause hearing shall be 
conducted unless a hearing is needed to consider additional violation 
charges that may be determinative of the Commission's decision whether 
to revoke parole.
    (i) Combined probable cause and local revocation hearing. A 
postponed probable cause hearing may be conducted as a combined probable 
cause and local revocation hearing, provided such hearing is conducted 
within 65 days of the parolee's arrest and the parolee has been notified 
that the postponed probable cause hearing will constitute his final 
revocation hearing. The Commission's policy is to conduct a combined 
probable cause and local revocation hearing whenever adverse witnesses 
are required to appear and give testimony with respect to contested 
charges.
    (j) Late received charges. If the Commission is notified of an 
additional charge after probable cause has been found to proceed with a 
revocation hearing, the Commission may:
    (1) Remand the case for a supplemental probable cause hearing if the 
new charge may be contested by the parolee and possibly result in the 
appearance of witness(es) at the revocation hearing;
    (2) Notify the parolee that the additional charge will be considered 
at the revocation hearing without conducting a supplemental probable 
cause hearing; or
    (3) Determine that the new charge shall not be considered at the 
revocation hearing.

<R05>
Sec. 2.102  Place of revocation hearing.

    (a) If the parolee requests a local revocation hearing, he shall be 
given a revocation hearing reasonably near the place of the alleged 
violation(s) or arrest, with the opportunity to contest the charges 
against him, if the following conditions are met:
    (1) The parolee has not been convicted of a crime committed while 
under supervision; and
    (2) The parolee denies all charges against him.
    (b) The parolee shall also be given a local revocation hearing if he 
admits (or has been convicted of) one or more charged violations, but 
denies at least one unadjudicated charge that may be determinative of 
the Commission's decision regarding revocation and/or reparole, and 
requests the presence of one or more adverse witnesses regarding that 
contested charge. If the appearance of such witness at the hearing is 
precluded by the Commission for good cause, a local revocation hearing 
shall not be ordered.
    (c) If there are two or more contested charges, a local revocation 
hearing may be conducted near the place of the violation chiefly relied 
upon by the Commission as a basis for the issuance of the warrant or 
summons.
    (d)(1) A parolee shall be given an institutional revocation hearing 
upon the parolee's return or recommitment to an institution if the 
parolee:
    (i) Voluntarily waives the right to a local revocation hearing; or

[[Page 182]]

    (ii) Admits (or has been convicted of) one or more charged 
violations without contesting any unadjudicated charge that may be 
determinative of the Commission's decision regarding revocation and/or 
reparole.
    (2) An institutional revocation hearing may also be conducted in the 
District of Columbia jail or prison facility in which the parolee is 
being held. On his own motion, a Commissioner may designate any case 
described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section for a local revocation 
hearing. The difference in procedures between a ``local revocation 
hearing'' and an ``institutional revocation hearing'' is set forth in 
Sec. 2.103(b).
    (e) A parolee retaken on a warrant issued by the Commission shall be 
retained in custody until final action relative to revocation of his 
parole, unless otherwise ordered by the Commission under Sec. 
2.101(e)(3). A parolee who has been given a revocation hearing pursuant 
to the issuance of a summons shall remain on supervision pending the 
decision of the Commission, unless the Commission has provided 
otherwise.
    (f) A local revocation hearing shall be held not later than sixty-
five days from the retaking of the parolee on the parole violation 
warrant. An institutional revocation hearing shall be held within ninety 
days of the retaking of the parolee on the parole violation warrant. If 
the parolee requests and receives any postponement, or consents to any 
postponement, or by his actions otherwise precludes the prompt 
completion of revocation proceedings in his case, the above-stated time 
limits shall be correspondingly extended.

[65 FR 45888, July 26, 2000, as amended at 67 FR 2570, Jan. 18, 2002; 68 
FR 41531, July 14, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 2.103  Revocation hearing procedure.

    (a) The purpose of the revocation hearing shall be to determine 
whether the parolee has violated the conditions of his release and, if 
so, whether his parole or mandatory release should be revoked or 
reinstated.
    (b) At a local revocation hearing, the alleged violator may present 
voluntary witnesses and documentary evidence in his behalf. The alleged 
violator may also seek the compulsory attendance of any adverse 
witnesses for cross-examination, and any relevant favorable witnesses 
who have not volunteered to attend. At an institutional revocation 
hearing, the alleged violator may present voluntary witnesses and 
documentary evidence in his behalf, but may not request the Commission 
to secure the attendance of any adverse or favorable witness. At any 
hearing, the presiding hearing officer or examiner may limit or exclude 
any irrelevant or repetitious statement or documentary evidence, and may 
prohibit the parolee from contesting matters already adjudicated against 
him in other forums.
    (c) At a local revocation hearing, the Commission shall, on the 
request of the alleged violator, require the attendance of any adverse 
witnesses who have given statements upon which revocation may be based. 
The adverse witnesses who are present shall be made available for 
questioning and cross-examination in the presence of the alleged 
violator. The Commission may also require the attendance of adverse 
witnesses on its own motion, and may excuse any requested adverse 
witness from appearing at the hearing (or from appearing in the presence 
of the alleged violator) if it finds good cause for so doing. A finding 
of good cause for the non-appearance of a requested adverse witness may 
be based, for example, on a significant possibility of harm to the 
witness, the witness not being reasonably available, and/or the 
availability of documentary evidence that is an adequate substitute for 
live testimony.
    (d) All evidence upon which a finding of violation may be based 
shall be disclosed to the alleged violator before the revocation 
hearing. Such evidence shall include the Community Supervision Officer's 
letter summarizing the parolee's adjustment to parole and requesting the 
warrant, all other documents describing the charged violation or 
violations of parole, and any additional evidence upon which the 
Commission intends to rely in determining whether the charged violation 
or violations, if sustained, would warrant revocation of parole. If the 
parolee is represented by an attorney, the attorney shall be provided, 
prior to the revocation hearing, with a copy of the parolee's 
presentence investigation report, if

[[Page 183]]

such report is available to the Commission. If disclosure of any 
information would reveal the identity of a confidential informant or 
result in harm to any person, that information may be withheld from 
disclosure, in which case a summary of the withheld information shall be 
disclosed to the parolee prior to the revocation hearing.
    (e) An alleged violator may be represented by an attorney at either 
a local or an institutional revocation hearing. In lieu of an attorney, 
an alleged violator may be represented at any revocation hearing by a 
person of his choice. However, the role of such non-attorney 
representative shall be limited to offering a statement on the alleged 
violator's behalf. Only licensed attorneys shall be permitted to 
question witnesses, make objections, and otherwise provide legal 
representation for parolees, except in the case of law students 
appearing before the Commission as part of a court-approved clinical 
practice program, with the consent of the alleged violator, and under 
the personal direction of a lawyer or law professor who is physically 
present at the hearing.
    (f) At a local revocation hearing, the Commission shall secure the 
presence of the parolee's Community Supervision Officer, or a substitute 
Community Supervision Officer, who shall bring the parolee's supervision 
file, if the parolee's Community Supervision Officer is not available. 
At the request of the hearing examiner, such officer shall provide 
testimony at the hearing concerning the parolee's adjustment to parole.
    (g) After the revocation hearing, the hearing examiner shall prepare 
a summary of the hearing that includes a description of the evidence 
against the parolee and the evidence submitted by the parolee in defense 
or mitigation of the charges, a summary of the arguments against 
revocation presented by the parolee, and the examiner's recommended 
decision. The hearing examiner's summary, together with the parolee's 
file (including any documentary evidence and letters submitted on behalf 
of the parolee), shall be given to another examiner for review. When two 
hearing examiners concur in a recommended disposition, that 
recommendation, together with the parolee's file and the hearing 
examiner's summary of the hearing, shall be submitted to the Commission 
for decision.

<R05>
Sec. 2.104  Issuance of subpoena for appearance of witnesses or production of 

documents.

    (a)(1) If any adverse witness (i.e., a person who has given 
information upon which revocation may be based) refuses, upon request by 
the Commission, to appear at a probable cause hearing or local 
revocation hearing, a Commissioner may issue a subpoena for the 
appearance of such witness. Such subpoena may also be issued at the 
discretion of a Commissioner in the event such adverse witness is judged 
unlikely to appear as requested.
    (2) In addition, a Commissioner may, upon a showing by the parolee 
that a witness whose testimony is necessary to the proper disposition of 
his case will not appear voluntarily at a local revocation hearing or 
provide an adequate written statement of his testimony, issue a subpoena 
for the appearance of such witness at the revocation hearing.
    (3) Such subpoenas may also be issued at the discretion of a 
Commissioner if deemed necessary for the orderly processing of the case.
    (b) A subpoena issued pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section may 
require the production of documents as well as, or in lieu of, a 
personal appearance. The subpoena shall specify the time and the place 
at which the person named therein is commanded to appear, and shall 
specify any documents required to be produced.
    (c) A subpoena may be served by any Federal or District of Columbia 
officer authorized to serve criminal process. The subpoena may be served 
at any place within the judicial district in which the place specified 
in the subpoena is located, or any place where the witness may be found. 
Service of a subpoena upon a person named therein shall be made by 
delivering a copy thereof to such a person.
    (d) If a person refuses to obey such subpoena, the Commission may 
petition a court of the United States for

[[Page 184]]

the judicial district on which the parole proceeding is being conducted, 
or in which such person may be found, to require such person to appear, 
testify, or produce evidence. If the court issues an order requiring 
such person to appear before the Commission, failure to obey such an 
order is punishable as contempt. 18 U.S.C. 4214 (1976).

Sec. 2.105  Revocation decisions.

    (a) Whenever a parolee is summoned or retaken by the Commission, and 
the Commission finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the parolee 
has violated one or more conditions of parole, the Commission may take 
any of the following actions:
    (1) Restore the parolee to supervision, including where appropriate:
    (i) Reprimand the parolee;
    (ii) Modify the parolee's conditions of release; or
    (iii) Refer the parolee to a residential community treatment center 
for all or part of the remainder of his original sentence; or
    (2) Revoke parole.
    (b) If parole is revoked pursuant to this section, the Commission 
shall also determine whether immediate reparole is warranted or whether 
parole should be terminated pursuant to D.C. Code 24-406(a). Termination 
of parole shall return the parolee to prison. If the parolee is returned 
to prison, the Commission shall also determine a presumptive release 
date pursuant to Sec. 2.81.
    (c) Decisions under this section shall be made by one Commissioner, 
except that a decision to override an examiner panel recommendation 
shall require the concurrence of two Commissioners. The final decision 
following a local revocation hearing shall be issued within 86 days of 
the retaking of the parolee on the parole violation warrant. The final 
decision following an institutional revocation hearing shall be issued 
within 21 days of the hearing, excluding weekends and holidays.
    (d) Pursuant to D.C. Code 24-406(a), a parolee whose parole is 
revoked by the Commission shall receive no credit toward his sentence 
for time spent on parole, including any time the parolee may have spent 
in confinement on other sentences (or in a halfway house as a condition 
of parole) prior to the execution of the Commission's warrant.
    (e) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, 
prisoners committed under the Federal Youth Corrections Act shall not be 
subject to forfeiture of time on parole, but shall serve uninterrupted 
sentences from the date of conviction except as provided in Sec. 
2.10(b) and (c). This exception from D.C. Code 24-406(a) does not apply 
to prisoners serving sentences under the D.C. Youth Rehabilitation Act, 
to which D.C. Code 24-406(a) is fully applicable.
    (f) In determining whether to revoke parole for non-compliance with 
a condition requiring payment of a fine, restitution, court costs or 
assessment, and/or court ordered child support or alimony payment, the 
Commission shall consider the parolee's employment status, earning 
ability, financial resources, and any other special circumstances that 
may have a bearing on the matter. Revocation shall not be ordered unless 
the parolee is found to be deliberately evading or refusing compliance.
    (g) A parolee may appeal a decision made under this section to 
revoke parole, to grant or deny reparole, or to modify the conditions of 
release. The provisions of Sec. 2.26 on the time limits for filing and 
deciding the appeal, the grounds for appeal, the format of the appeal, 
the limits regarding the submission of exhibits, and voting requirements 
apply to an appeal submitted under this paragraph.

Sec. 2.106  Youth Rehabilitation Act.

    (a) Regulations governing YRA offenders and D.C. Code FYCA 
offenders. Unless the judgment and commitment order provides otherwise, 
the provisions of this section shall apply to an offender sentenced 
under the Youth Rehabilitation Act of 1985 (D.C. Code 24-901 et seq.) 
(YRA) who committed his offense before 5 p.m., August 11, 2000, and a 
D.C. Code offender sentenced

[[Page 185]]

under the former Federal Youth Corrections Act (former 18 U.S.C. 5005 et 
seq.) (FYCA). An offender sentenced under the YRA who committed his 
offense (or who continued to commit his offense) on or after 5 p.m., 
August 11, 2000, is not eligible for release on parole, but may be 
terminated from a term of supervised release before the expiration of 
the term and receive a certificate setting aside the conviction under 
Sec. 2.208(f). See D.C. Code 24-904(c) and 24-906(c).
    (b) Application of this subpart to YRA offenders. All provisions of 
this subpart that apply to adult offenders also apply to YRA offenders 
unless a specific exception is made for YRA (or youth) offenders.
    (c) No further benefit finding. If there is a finding that a YRA 
offender will derive no further benefit from treatment, such prisoner 
shall be considered for parole, and for any other action, exclusively 
under the provisions of this subpart that are applicable to adult 
offenders. Such a finding may be made pursuant to D.C. Code 24-905 by 
the Department of Corrections or by the Bureau of Prisons, and shall be 
promptly forwarded to the Commission. However, if the finding is 
appealed to the sentencing judge, the prisoner will continue to be 
treated under the provisions pertaining to YRA offenders until the judge 
makes a final decision denying the appeal.
    (d)(1) Program plans and using program achievement to set the parole 
date. At a YRA prisoner's initial parole hearing, a program plan for the 
prisoner's treatment shall be submitted by institutional staff and 
reviewed by the hearing examiner. Any proposed modifications to the plan 
shall be discussed at the hearing, although further relevant information 
may be presented and considered after the hearing. The plan shall 
adequately account for the risk implications of the prisoner's current 
offense and criminal history and shall address the prisoner's need for 
rehabilitational training. The program plan shall also include an 
estimated date of completion. The criteria at Sec. 2.64(d) for 
successful response to treatment programs shall be considered by the 
Commission in determining whether the proposed program plan would 
effectively reduce the risk to the public welfare.
    (2) The youth offender's response to treatment programs and program 
achievement shall be considered with other relevant factors, such as the 
offense and parole prognosis, in determining when the youth offender 
should be conditionally released under supervision. See Sec. 2.64(e). 
The guidelines at Sec. 2.80(k)-(m) on awarding superior program 
achievement and the subtraction of any award in determining the total 
guideline range shall not be used in the decision.
    (e) Parole violators. A YRA parolee who has had his parole revoked 
shall be scheduled for a rehearing within six months of the revocation 
hearing to review the new program plan prepared by institutional staff, 
unless a parole effective date is granted after the revocation hearing. 
Such program plan shall reflect a thorough reassessment of the 
prisoner's rehabilitational needs in light of the prisoner's failure on 
parole. Decisions on reparole shall be made using the guidelines at 
Sec. 2.80. If a YRA parolee is sentenced to a new prison term of one 
year or more for a crime committed while on parole, the case shall be 
referred to correctional authorities for consideration of a ``no further 
benefit'' finding.
    (f) Unconditional discharge from supervision. (1) A YRA parolee may 
be unconditionally discharged from supervision after service of one year 
on parole supervision if the Commission finds that supervision is no 
longer needed to protect the public safety. A review of the parolee's 
file shall be conducted after the conclusion of each year of supervision 
upon receipt of an annual progress report, and upon receipt of a final 
report to be submitted by the supervision officer six months prior to 
the sentence expiration date.
    (2) In making a decision concerning unconditional discharge, the 
Commission shall consider the facts and circumstances of each case, 
focusing on the risk the parolee poses to the public and the benefit he 
may obtain from further supervision. The decision shall be made after an 
analysis of case-specific factors, including, but not limited to, the 
parolee's prior criminal history, the offense behavior that led to his

[[Page 186]]

conviction, record of drug or alcohol dependence, employment history, 
stability of residence and family relationships, and the number and 
nature of any incidents while under supervision (including new arrests, 
alleged parole violations, and criminal investigations).
    (3) An order of unconditional discharge from supervision terminates 
the YRA offender's sentence. Whenever a YRA offender is unconditionally 
discharged from supervision, the Commission shall issue a certificate 
setting aside the offender's conviction. If the YRA offender is not 
unconditionally discharged from supervision prior to the expiration of 
his sentence, a certificate setting aside the conviction may be issued 
nunc pro tunc if the Commission finds that the failure to issue the 
decision on time was due to administrative delay or error, or that the 
Supervision Officer failed to present the Commission with a progress 
report before the end of the supervision term, and the offender's own 
actions did not contribute to the absence of the final report. However, 
the offender must have deserved to be unconditionally discharged from 
supervision before the end of his supervision term for a nunc pro tunc 
certificate to issue.

Sec. 2.107  Interstate Compact.

    (a) Pursuant to D.C. Code 24-133(b)(2)(G), the Director of the Court 
Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA), or his designee, shall 
be the Compact Administrator with regard to the following individuals on 
parole supervision pursuant to the Interstate Parole and Probation 
Compact authorized by D.C. Code 24-451:
    (1) All D.C. Code parolees who are under the supervision of agencies 
in jurisdictions outside the District of Columbia; and
    (2) All parolees from other jurisdictions who are under the 
supervision of CSOSA within the District of Columbia.
    (b) Transfers of supervision pursuant to the Interstate Compact, 
where appropriate, may be arranged by the Compact Administrator, or his 
designee, and carried out with the approval of the Parole Commission. A 
D.C. Code parolee who is under the Parole Commission's jurisdiction will 
ordinarily be released or transferred to the supervision of a U.S. 
Probation Office outside the District of Columbia.
    (c) Upon receipt of a report that a D.C. Code parolee, who is under 
supervision pursuant to the Interstate Compact in a jurisdiction outside 
the District of Columbia, has violated his or her parole, the Commission 
may issue a warrant pursuant to the procedures of Sec. 2.98. The 
warrant may be executed as provided as in Sec. 2.99. A parolee who is 
arrested on such a warrant shall be considered to be a prisoner in 
federal custody, and may be returned to the District of Columbia or 
designated to a facility of the Bureau of Prisons at the request of the 
Commission.
    (d) If a parolee from another jurisdiction, who is under the 
supervision of CSOSA pursuant to the Interstate Compact, is alleged to 
have violated his or her parole, the Compact Administrator or his 
designee may issue a temporary warrant to secure the arrest of the 
parolee pending issuance of a warrant by the original paroling agency. 
If so requested, the Commission will conduct a courtesy revocation 
hearing on behalf of the original paroling agency whenever a revocation 
hearing within the District of Columbia is required.
    (e) The term ``D.C. Code parolee'' shall include any felony offender 
who is serving a period of parole or mandatory release supervision 
pursuant to a sentence of imprisonment imposed under the District of 
Columbia Code.

<R05>
Sec. 2.200  Authority, jurisdiction, and functions of the U.S. Parole 

Commission with respect to offenders serving terms of supervised release 

imposed by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.

    (a) The U.S. Parole Commission has jurisdiction, pursuant to D.C. 
Code 24-133(c)(2), over all offenders serving terms of supervised 
release imposed by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia under 
the Sentencing Reform Emergency Amendment Act of 2000.
    (b) The U.S. Parole Commission shall have and exercise the same 
authority with respect to a term of supervised release as is vested in 
the United States district courts by 18 U.S.C. 3583(d) through (i), 
except that:
    (1) The procedures followed by the Commission in exercising that 
authority shall be those set forth with respect to offenders on federal 
parole at 18 U.S.C. 4209 through 4215 (Chapter 311 of 18 United States 
Code); and
    (2) An extension of a term of supervised release under subsection 
(e)(2) of 18 U.S.C. 3583 may only be ordered by the Superior Court upon 
motion from the Commission.
    (c) Within the District of Columbia, supervision of offenders on 
terms of supervised release under the Commission's jurisdiction is 
carried out by the Community Supervision Officers of the Court Services 
and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA), pursuant to D.C. Code 24-
133(c)(2). Outside the District of Columbia, supervision is carried out 
by United States Probation Officers pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3655. For the 
purpose of this subpart, any reference to a ``supervision officer'' 
shall include both a Community Supervision Officer of CSOSA and a United 
States Probation Officer in the case of a releasee who is under 
supervision outside the District of Columbia.


<R05>
Sec. 2.201  Period of supervised release.

    (a) A period of supervised release that is subject to the 
Commission's jurisdiction begins to run on the day the offender is 
released from prison and continues to the expiration of the full term 
imposed by the Superior Court, unless early termination is granted by 
the Commission.
    (b) A term of supervised release shall run concurrently with any 
federal, state, or local term of probation, parole or supervised release 
for another offense, but does not run while the offender is imprisoned 
in connection with a conviction for a federal, state, or local crime 
(including a term of imprisonment resulting from a probation, parole, or 
supervised release revocation) unless the period of imprisonment is less 
than 30 days. Such interruption of the term of supervised release is 
required by D.C. Code 24-403.01(b)(5), and is not dependent upon the 
issuance of a warrant or an order of revocation by the Commission.
    (c)(1) For an offender serving multiple terms of supervised release 
imposed by the Superior Court, the duration of the Commission's 
jurisdiction over the offender shall be governed by the longest term 
imposed.
    (2) If the Commission terminates such an offender from supervision 
on the longest term imposed, this order shall have the effect of 
terminating the offender from all terms of supervised release that the 
offender is serving at the time of the order.
    (3) If the Commission issues a warrant or summons for such an 
offender, or revokes supervised release for such an offender, the 
Commission's action shall have the effect of commencing revocation 
proceedings on, or revoking, all terms that the offender is serving at 
the time of the action. In revoking supervised release the Commission 
shall impose a term of imprisonment and a further term of supervised 
release as if the Commission were revoking a single term of supervised 
release. For the purpose of calculating the maximum authorized term of 
imprisonment at first revocation and the original maximum authorized 
term of supervised release, the Commission shall use the unexpired 
supervised release term imposed for the offense punishable by the 
longest maximum term of imprisonment.
    (4) If such an offender is released to a further term of supervised 
release after serving a prison term resulting from a supervised release 
revocation, the Commission shall consider the offender to be serving 
only the single term of supervised release ordered after revocation.

[[Page 188]]


<R05>
Sec. 2.202  Prerelease procedures.

    (a) At least three months, but not more than six months, prior to 
the release of a prisoner who has been sentenced to a term or terms of 
supervised release by the Superior Court, the responsible prison 
officials shall have the prisoner's release plan forwarded to CSOSA (or 
to the appropriate U.S. Probation Office) for investigation. If the 
supervision officer believes that any special condition of supervised 
release should be imposed prior to the release of the prisoner, the 
officer shall forward a request for such condition to the Commission. 
The Commission may, upon such request or of its own accord, impose any 
special condition in addition to the standard conditions specified in 
Sec. 2.204, which shall take effect on the day the prisoner is 
released.
    (b) Upon the release of the prisoner, the responsible prison 
officials shall instruct the prisoner, in writing, to report to the 
assigned supervision office within 72 hours, and shall inform the 
prisoner that failure to report on time shall constitute a violation of 
supervised release. If the prisoner is released to the custody of other 
authorities, the prisoner shall be instructed to report to the 
supervision office within 72 hours after his release from the physical 
custody of such authorities. If the prisoner is unable to report to the 
supervision office within 72 hours of release because of an emergency, 
the prisoner shall be instructed to report to the nearest U.S. Probation 
Office and obey the instructions given by the duty officer.


<R05>
Sec. 2.203  Certificate of supervised release.

    When an offender who has been released from prison to serve a term 
of supervised release reports to the supervision officer for the first 
time, the supervision officer shall deliver to the releasee a 
certificate listing the conditions of supervised release imposed by the 
Commission and shall explain the conditions to the releasee.


<R05>
Sec. 2.204  Conditions of supervised release.

    (a)(1) General conditions of release and notice by certificate of 
release. The conditions set forth in paragraphs (a)(3)-(6) of this 
section apply to every releasee and are necessary to protect the public 
from further crimes by the releasee and to provide adequate supervision 
of the releasee. The certificate of release issued to each releasee by 
the Commission notifies the releasee of these conditions.
    (2) Effect of refusal to sign certificate of release. A releasee who 
refuses to sign the certificate of release is nonetheless bound by the 
conditions set forth in that certificate.
    (3) Reporting arrival. The releasee shall go directly to the 
district named in the certificate, appear in person at the supervision 
office, and report the releasee's residence address to the supervision 
officer. If the releasee is unable to appear in person at that office 
within 72 hours of release because of an emergency, the releasee shall 
report to the nearest U.S. Probation Office and obey the instructions 
given by the duty officer. A releasee who is initially released to the 
physical custody of another authority shall follow the procedures 
described in this paragraph upon release from the custody of the other 
authority.
    (4) Providing information to and cooperating with the supervision 
officer. (i) The releasee shall, between the first and third day of each 
month, make a written report to the supervision officer on a form 
provided for that purpose. The releasee shall also report to the 
supervision officer at such times and in such a manner as that officer 
directs and shall provide such information as the supervision officer 
requests. All information that a releasee provides to the supervision 
officer shall be complete and truthful.
    (ii) The releasee shall notify the supervision officer within two 
days of an arrest or questioning by a law-enforcement officer, a change 
in place of residence, or a change in employment.
    (iii) The releasee shall permit the supervision officer to visit the 
releasee's residence and workplace.
    (iv) The releasee shall permit the supervision officer to confiscate 
any material that the supervision officer believes may constitute 
contraband and that is in plain view in the releasee's possession, 
including in the releasee's residence, workplace, or vehicle.

[[Page 189]]

    (v) The releasee shall submit to a drug or alcohol test whenever 
ordered to do so by the supervision officer.
    (5) Prohibited conduct. (i) The releasee shall not violate any law 
and shall not associate with a person who is violating any law.
    (ii) The releasee shall not possess a firearm, other dangerous 
weapon, or ammunition.
    (iii) The releasee shall not drink alcoholic beverages to excess and 
shall not illegally buy, possess, use, or administer a controlled 
substance. The releasee shall not frequent a place where a controlled 
substance is illegally sold, dispensed, used, or given away.
    (iv) The releasee shall not leave the geographic limits set by the 
certificate of release without written permission from the supervision 
officer.
    (v) The releasee shall not associate with a person who has a 
criminal record without permission from the supervision officer.
    (vi) The releasee shall not enter into an agreement to act as an 
informer or special agent for a law-enforcement agency without the prior 
approval of the Commission.
    (6) Additional conditions. (i) The releasee shall make a diligent 
effort to work regularly, unless excused by the supervision officer, and 
to support any legal dependent. The releasee shall participate in an 
employment readiness program if so directed by the supervision officer.
    (ii) The releasee shall make a diligent effort to satisfy any fine, 
restitution order, court costs or assessment, or court-ordered child 
support or alimony payment to which the releasee is subject. The 
releasee shall provide financial information relevant to the payment of 
such a financial obligation that is requested by the supervision 
officer. If unable to pay such a financial obligation in one sum, the 
releasee shall cooperate with the supervision officer to establish an 
installment-payment schedule.
    (iii) If the term of supervision results from a conviction for a 
domestic violence crime, and such conviction is the releasee's first 
conviction for such a crime, the releasee shall, as directed by the 
supervision officer, attend an approved offender-rehabilitation program 
if such a program is readily available within a 50-mile radius of the 
releasee's residence.
    (iv) The releasee shall comply with any applicable sex-offender 
reporting and registration law.
    (v) The releasee shall provide a DNA sample, as directed by the 
supervision officer, if collection of such sample is authorized by the 
DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000.
    (vi) If the releasee is supervised by the District of Columbia Court 
Services and Offender Supervision Agency, the releasee shall submit to 
the sanctions imposed by the supervision officer within the limits 
established by an approved schedule of graduated sanctions if the 
supervision officer finds that the releasee has tested positive for 
illegal drugs or has committed a noncriminal violation of the conditions 
of release. Notwithstanding the imposition of a graduated sanction, if 
the Commission believes the releasee is a risk to the public safety, or 
is not complying in good faith with the sanction imposed, the Commission 
may commence revocation proceedings on the alleged violation(s) upon 
which the graduated sanction was based.
    (vii) As directed by the supervision officer, the releasee shall 
notify a person of a risk of harm that may be determined from a review 
of the releasee's criminal record or personal history and 
characteristics. In addition, the supervision officer is authorized to 
make such notifications as are permitted by the Commission's rules, and 
to confirm the releasee's compliance with any notification directive.
    (b)(1) Special conditions of release. The Commission may impose a 
condition other than a condition set forth in paragraphs (a)(3)-(6) of 
this section if the Commission determines that such condition is 
necessary to protect the public from further crimes by the releasee and 
provide adequate supervision of the releasee.
    (2) The following are examples of special conditions frequently 
imposed by the Commission--
    (i) That the releasee reside in or participate in the program of a 
community corrections center, or both, for all or part of the period of 
supervision;

[[Page 190]]

    (ii) That the releasee participate in a drug-or alcohol-treatment 
program, and abstain from all use of alcohol and other intoxicants;
    (iii) That, as an alternative to incarceration, the releasee remain 
at home during nonworking hours and have compliance with this condition 
monitored by telephone or electronic signaling devices; and
    (iv) That the releasee permit a supervision officer to conduct a 
search of the releasee's person, or of any building, vehicle, or other 
area under the control of the releasee, at such time as that supervision 
officer shall decide, and to seize contraband found thereon or therein.
    (3) If the Commission requires the releasee's participation in a 
drug-treatment program, the releasee must submit to a drug test within 
15 days of release and to at least two other drug tests, as determined 
by the supervision officer. A decision not to impose this special 
condition, because available information indicates a low risk of future 
substance abuse by the releasee, shall constitute good cause for 
suspension of the drug testing requirements of 18 U.S.C. 3583(d).
    (c) Changing conditions of release. (1) The Commission may at any 
time modify or add to the conditions of release if the Commission 
determines that such modification or addition is necessary to protect 
the public from further crimes by the releasee and provide adequate 
supervision of the releasee.
    (2)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, 
before the Commission orders a change of condition, the releasee shall 
be notified of the proposed modification or addition and, unless waived, 
shall have 10 days from receipt of such notification to comment on the 
proposed modification or addition. Following that 10-day period, the 
Commission shall have 21 days, exclusive of holidays, to determine 
whether to order such modification or addition to the conditions of 
release.
    (ii) The 10-day notice requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this 
section does not apply to a change of condition that results from a 
revocation hearing for the releasee, a determination that the 
modification or addition must be ordered immediately to prevent harm to 
the releasee or to the public, or a request from the releasee.
    (d) Application of release conditions to absconder. A releasee who 
absconds from supervision prevents the term of supervision from expiring 
and the running of the term is tolled during the time that the releasee 
is an absconder. A releasee who absconds from supervision remains bound 
by the conditions of release, even after the date that the term of 
supervision originally was scheduled to expire. The Commission may 
revoke the term of supervision based on a violation of a release 
condition committed by such a releasee before the expiration of the term 
of supervision, as extended by the period of absconding.
    (e) Revocation for certain violations of release conditions. If the 
Commission finds after a revocation hearing that a releasee has 
possessed a controlled substance, refused to comply with drug testing, 
possessed a firearm, or tested positive for illegal controlled 
substances more than three times over the course of one year, the 
Commission shall revoke the term of supervision and impose a term of 
imprisonment as provided at Sec. 2.218. If the releasee fails a drug 
test, the Commission shall consider appropriate alternatives to 
revocation.
    (f) Supervision officer guidance. The Commission expects a releasee 
to understand the conditions of release according to the plain meaning 
of those conditions and to seek the guidance of the supervision officer 
before engaging in conduct that may violate a condition of release. The 
supervision officer may instruct a releasee to refrain from particular 
conduct, or take specific steps to avoid violating a condition of 
release, or to correct an existing violation of a condition of release. 
The releasee's failure to obey a directive from the supervision officer 
to report on compliance with such instructions may be considered as a 
violation of the condition described at paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this 
section.
    (g) Definitions. As used in this section, the term--
    (1) Releasee means a person who has been sentenced to a term of 
supervised

[[Page 191]]

release by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia;
    (2) Supervision officer means a Community Supervision Officer of the 
District of Columbia Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency or 
United States Probation Officer;
    (3) Domestic violence crime has the meaning given that term by 18 
U.S.C. 3561, except that the term ``court of the United States'' as used 
in that definition shall be deemed to include the District of Columbia 
Superior Court;
    (4) Approved offender-rehabilitation program means a program that 
has been approved by the District of Columbia Court Services and 
Offender Supervision Agency (or the United States Probation Office) in 
consultation with a State Coalition Against Domestic Violence or other 
appropriate experts;
    (5) Certificate of release means the certificate of supervised 
release delivered to the releasee under Sec. 2.203; and
    (6) Firearm has the meaning given by 18 U.S.C. 921.


<R05>
Sec. 2.205  Confidentiality of supervised release records.

    (a) Consistent with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C 552a(b)), the 
contents of supervised release records shall be confidential and shall 
not be disclosed outside the Commission and CSOSA (or the U.S. Probation 
Office) except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) Information pertaining to a releasee may be disclosed to the 
general public, without the consent of the releasee, as authorized by 
Sec. 2.37.
    (c) Information other than as described in Sec. 2.37 may be 
disclosed without the consent of the releasee only pursuant to the 
provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a(b)) and the 
implementing rules of the Commission or CSOSA, as applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 2.206  Travel approval and transfers of supervision.

    (a) A releasee's supervision officer may approve travel outside the 
district of supervision without approval of the Commission in the 
following situations:
    (1) Trips not to exceed thirty days for family emergencies, 
vacations, and similar personal reasons;
    (2) Trips, not to exceed thirty days, to investigate reasonably 
certain employment possibilities; and
    (3) Recurring travel across a district boundary, not to exceed fifty 
miles outside the district, for purpose of employment, shopping, or 
recreation.
    (b) Specific advance approval by the Commission is required for all 
foreign travel, employment requiring recurring travel more than fifty 
miles outside the district, and vacation travel outside the district of 
supervision exceeding thirty days. A request for such permission shall 
be in writing and must demonstrate a substantial need for such travel.
    (c) A special condition imposed by the Commission prohibiting 
certain travel shall apply instead of any general rules relating to 
travel as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) The district of supervision for a releasee under the supervision 
of CSOSA shall be the District of Columbia, except that for the purpose 
of travel permission under this section, the district of supervision 
shall include the D.C. metropolitan area as defined in the certificate 
of supervised release.
    (e) A supervised releasee who is under the jurisdiction of the 
Commission, and who is released or transferred to a district outside the 
District of Columbia, shall be supervised by a U.S. Probation Officer 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3655.
    (f) A supervised releasee may be transferred to a new district of 
supervision with the permission of the supervision offices of both the 
transferring and receiving district, provided such transfer is not 
contrary to instructions from the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 2.207  Supervision reports to Commission.

    A regular supervision report shall be submitted to the Commission by 
the supervision officer after the completion of 12 months of continuous 
community supervision and annually thereafter. The supervision officer 
shall submit such additional reports and information concerning both the 
releasee, and the enforcement of the conditions of supervised release, 
as the Commission may direct. All reports shall be submitted according 
to the format established by the Commission.

[[Page 192]]


<R05>
Sec. 2.208  Termination of a term of supervised release.

    (a) The Commission, in its discretion, may terminate a term of 
supervised release and discharge the releasee from further supervision 
at any time after the expiration of one year of supervised release, if 
the Commission is satisfied that such action is warranted by the conduct 
of the releasee and the interest of justice.
    (b) Two years after release on supervision, and at least annually 
thereafter, the Commission shall review the status of each releasee to 
determine the need for continued supervision. In calculating such two-
year period there shall not be included any period of release prior to 
the most recent release, nor any period served in confinement on any 
other sentence. A review shall also be conducted whenever termination of 
supervision is specially recommended by the releasee's supervision 
officer. If the term of supervised release imposed by the court is two 
years or less, termination of supervision shall be considered only if 
specially recommended by the releasee's supervision officer.
    (c) In determining whether to grant early termination of 
supervision, the Commission shall calculate for the releasee a Salient 
Factor Score under Sec. 2.20, and shall apply the following early 
termination guidelines, provided that case-specific factors do not 
indicate a need for continued supervision:
    (1) For a releasee classified in the very good risk category and 
whose current offense did not involve violence, termination of 
supervision may be ordered after two continuous years of incident-free 
supervision in the community.
    (2) For a releasee classified in the very good risk category and 
whose current offense involved violence other than high level violence, 
termination of supervision may be ordered after three continuous years 
of incident-free supervision in the community.
    (3) For a releasee classified in the very good risk category and 
whose current offense involved high level violence (without death of 
victim resulting), termination of supervision may be ordered after four 
continuous years of incident-free supervision in the community.
    (4) For a releasee classified in other than the very good risk 
category, whose current offense did not involve violence, and whose 
prior record includes not more than one episode of felony violence, 
termination of supervision may be ordered after three continuous years 
of incident-free supervision in the community.
    (5) For a releasee classified in other than the very good risk 
category whose current offense involved violence other than high level 
violence, or whose current offense did not involve violence but the 
releasee's prior record includes two or more episodes of felony 
violence, termination of supervision may be ordered after four 
continuous years of incident-free supervision in the community.
    (6) For releasees in the following categories, release from 
supervision prior to five years may be ordered only upon a case-specific 
finding that, by reason of age, infirmity, or other compelling factors, 
the releasee is unlikely to be a threat to the public safety:
    (i) A releasee in other than the very good risk category whose 
current offense involved high level violence;
    (ii) A releasee whose current offense involved high level violence 
with death of victim resulting; and
    (iii) A releasee who is a sex offender serving a term of supervised 
release that exceeds five years.
    (7) The terms violence and high level violence are defined in Sec. 
2.80. The term incident-free supervision means that the releasee has had 
no reported violations, and has not been the subject of any arrest or 
law enforcement investigation that raises a reasonable doubt as to 
whether the releasee has been able to refrain from law violations while 
under supervision.
    (d) Except in the case of a releasee covered by paragraph (c)(6) of 
this section, a decision to terminate supervision below the guidelines 
may be made if it appears that the releasee is a better risk than 
indicated by the salient factor score (if classified in other than the 
very good risk category), or is a less serious risk to the public safety

[[Page 193]]

than indicated by a violent current offense or prior record. However, 
termination of supervision prior to the completion of two years of 
incident-free supervision will not be granted in any case unless case-
specific factors clearly indicate that continued supervision would be 
counterproductive to the releasee's rehabilitation.
    (e) A releasee with a pending criminal charge who is otherwise 
eligible for an early termination from supervision shall not be 
discharged from supervision until the disposition of such charge is 
known.
    (f) Decisions on the early termination of a term of supervised 
release for an offender sentenced under the YRA shall be made under the 
provisions of this section. If the Commission terminates the term of 
supervised release before the expiration of the term, the youth 
offender's conviction is automatically set aside and the Commission 
shall issue a certificate setting aside the conviction. See D.C. Code 
24-906(c), (d). The set-aside certificate shall be issued in lieu of the 
certificate of discharge described in Sec. 2.209.


<R05>
Sec. 2.209  Order of termination.

    When the Commission orders the termination of a term of supervised 
release, it shall issue a certificate to the releasee granting the 
releasee a full discharge from his term of supervised release. The 
termination and discharge shall take effect only upon the actual 
delivery of the certificate of discharge to the releasee by the 
supervision officer, and may be rescinded for good cause at any time 
prior to such delivery.


<R05>
Sec. 2.210  Extension of term.

    (a) At any time during service of a term of supervised release, the 
Commission may submit to the Superior Court a motion to extend the term 
of supervised release to the maximum term authorized by law, if less 
than the maximum authorized term was originally imposed. If the Superior 
Court grants the Commission's motion prior to the expiration of the term 
originally imposed, the extension ordered by the court shall take effect 
upon issuance of the order.
    (b) The Commission may submit the motion for an extension of a term 
of supervised release if the Commission finds that the rehabilitation of 
the releasee or the protection of the public from further crimes by the 
releasee is likely to require a longer period of supervision than the 
court originally contemplated. The Commission's grounds for making such 
a finding shall be stated in the motion filed with the court.
    (c) The provisions of this section shall not apply to the 
Commission's determination of an appropriate period of further 
supervised release following revocation of a term of supervised release.


<R05>
Sec. 2.211  Summons to appear or warrant for retaking releasee.

    (a) If a releasee is alleged to have violated the conditions of his 
release, and satisfactory evidence thereof is presented, a Commissioner 
may:
    (1) Issue a summons requiring the releasee to appear for a probable 
cause hearing or local revocation hearing; or
    (2) Issue a warrant for the apprehension and return of the releasee 
to custody.
    (b) A summons or warrant under paragraph (a) of this section may be 
issued or withdrawn only by a Commissioner.
    (c) Any summons or warrant under this section shall be issued as 
soon as practicable after the alleged violation is reported to the 
Commission, except when delay is deemed necessary. Issuance of a summons 
or warrant may be withheld until the frequency or seriousness of the 
violations, in the opinion of a Commissioner, requires such issuance. In 
the case of any releasee who is charged with a criminal offense and who 
is awaiting disposition of such charge, issuance of a summons or warrant 
may be:
    (1) Temporarily withheld;
    (2) Issued by the Commission and held in abeyance;
    (3) Issued by the Commission and a detainer lodged with the 
custodial authority; or
    (4) Issued for the retaking of the releasee.
    (d) A summons or warrant may be issued only within the maximum term

[[Page 194]]

or terms of the period of supervised release being served by the 
releasee, except as provided for an absconder from supervision in Sec. 
2.204(i). A summons or warrant shall be considered issued when signed 
and either:
    (1) Placed in the mail; or
    (2) Sent by electronic transmission to the appropriate law 
enforcement authority.
    (e) The issuance of a warrant under this section operates to bar the 
expiration of the term of supervised release. Such warrant maintains the 
Commission's jurisdiction to retake the releasee either before or after 
the normal expiration date of the term, and for such time as may be 
reasonably necessary for the Commission to reach a final decision as to 
revocation of the term of supervised release.
    (f) A summons or warrant issued pursuant to this section shall be 
accompanied by a warrant application (or other notice) stating:
    (1) The charges against the releasee;
    (2) The specific reports and other documents upon which the 
Commission intends to rely in determining whether a violation of 
supervised release has occurred and whether to revoke supervised 
release;
    (3) Notice of the Commission's intent, if the releasee is arrested 
within the District of Columbia, to hold a probable cause hearing within 
five days of the releasee's arrest;
    (4) A statement of the purpose of the probable cause hearing;
    (5) The days of the week on which the Commission regularly holds its 
dockets of probable cause hearings at the Central Detention Facility;
    (6) The releasee's procedural rights in the revocation process; and
    (7) The possible actions that the Commission may take.
    (g) In the case of an offender who is serving concurrent terms of 
parole and supervised release under the Commission's jurisdiction, the 
Commission may take any action permitted by this section on the basis of 
one or more of the terms (e.g., the Commission may issue warrants on 
both terms, and order that the first warrant should be executed, and 
that the second warrant should be placed as a detainer and executed only 
when the offender is released from the prison term that begins with the 
execution of the first warrant). The Commission may conduct separate 
revocation hearings, or consider all parole and supervised release 
violation charges in one combined hearing and make dispositions on the 
parole and supervised release terms. If the Commission conducts separate 
revocation hearings and revokes parole or supervised release at the 
first hearing, the Commission may conduct the subsequent hearing on the 
same violation behavior as an institutional hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 2.212  Execution of warrant and service of summons.

    (a) Any officer of any Federal or District of Columbia correctional 
institution, any Federal Officer authorized to serve criminal process, 
or any officer or designated civilian employee of the Metropolitan 
Police Department of the District of Columbia, to whom a warrant is 
delivered, shall execute such warrant by taking the releasee and 
returning him to the custody of the Attorney General.
    (b) Upon the arrest of the releasee, the officer executing the 
warrant shall deliver to the releasee a copy of the warrant application 
(or other notice provided by the Commission) containing the information 
described in Sec. 2.211(f).
    (c) If execution of the warrant is delayed pending disposition of 
local charges, for further investigation, or for some other purpose, the 
releasee is to be continued under supervision by the supervision officer 
until the normal expiration of the sentence, or until the warrant is 
executed, whichever first occurs. Monthly supervision reports are to be 
submitted, and the releasee must continue to abide by all the conditions 
of release.
    (d) If any other warrant for the arrest of the releasee has been 
executed or is outstanding at the time the Commission's warrant is 
executed, the arresting officer may, within 72 hours of executing the 
Commission's warrant, release the arrestee to such other warrant and 
lodge the Commission's warrant as a detainer, voiding the execution 
thereof, provided such action is consistent with the instructions of the

[[Page 195]]

Commission. In other cases, the arrestee may be released from an 
executed warrant whenever the Commission finds such action necessary to 
serve the ends of justice.
    (e) A summons to appear at a probable cause hearing or revocation 
hearing shall be served upon the releasee in person by delivering to the 
releasee a copy of the summons and the application therefor. Service 
shall be made by any Federal or District of Columbia officer authorized 
to serve criminal process and certification of such service shall be 
returned to the Commission.
    (f) Official notification of the issuance of a Commission warrant 
shall authorize any law enforcement officer within the United States to 
hold the releasee in custody until the warrant can be executed in 
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 2.213  Warrant placed as detainer and dispositional review.

    (a) When a releasee is a prisoner in the custody of other law 
enforcement authorities, or is serving a new sentence of imprisonment 
imposed for a crime (or for a violation of some other form of community 
supervision) committed while on supervised release, a violation warrant 
may be lodged against him as a detainer.
    (b) The Commission shall review the detainer upon the request of the 
prisoner pursuant to the procedure set forth in Sec. 2.47(a)(2). 
Following such review, the Commission may:
    (1) Withdraw the detainer and order reinstatement of the prisoner to 
supervision upon release from custody;
    (2) Order a dispositional revocation hearing to be conducted at the 
institution in which the prisoner is confined; or
    (3) Let the detainer stand until the new sentence is completed. 
Following the execution of the Commission's warrant, and the transfer of 
the prisoner to an appropriate federal facility, an institutional 
revocation hearing shall be conducted.
    (c) Dispositional revocation hearings pursuant to this section shall 
be conducted in accordance with the provisions at Sec. 2.216 governing 
institutional revocation hearings. A hearing conducted at a state or 
local facility may be conducted either by a hearing examiner or by any 
federal, state, or local official designated by a Commissioner. 
Following a revocation hearing conducted pursuant to this section, the 
Commission may take any action authorized by Sec. Sec. 2.218 and 2.219.
    (d) The date the violation term commences is the date the 
Commission's warrant is executed. A releasee's violation term (i.e., the 
term of imprisonment and/or further term of supervised release that the 
Commission may require the releasee to serve after revocation) shall 
start to run only upon the offender's release from the confinement 
portion of the intervening sentence.
    (e) An offender whose supervised release is revoked shall be given 
credit for all time in confinement resulting from any new offense or 
violation that is considered by the Commission as a basis for 
revocation, but solely for the purpose of satisfying the time ranges in 
the reparole guidelines at Sec. 2.21. The computation of the offender's 
sentence, and the forfeiture of time on supervised release, are not 
affected by such guideline credit.


<R05>
Sec. 2.214  Probable cause hearing and determination.

    (a) Hearing. A supervised releasee who is retaken and held in 
custody in the District of Columbia on a warrant issued by the 
Commission, and who has not been convicted of a new crime, shall be 
given a probable cause hearing by an examiner of the Commission no later 
than five days from the date of such retaking. A releasee who is retaken 
and held in custody outside the District of Columbia, but within the 
Washington D.C. metropolitan area, and who has not been convicted of a 
new crime, shall be given a probable cause hearing by an examiner of the 
Commission within five days of the releasee's arrival at a facility 
where probable cause hearings are conducted. The purpose of a probable 
cause hearing is to determine whether there is probable cause to believe 
that the releasee has violated the conditions of supervised release as 
charged, and if so, whether a local or institutional revocation hearing 
should be conducted. If the examiner finds probable cause, the

[[Page 196]]

examiner shall schedule a final revocation hearing to be held within 65 
days of the releasee's arrest.
    (b) Notice and opportunity to postpone hearing. Prior to the 
commencement of each docket of probable cause hearings in the District 
of Columbia, a list of the releasees who are scheduled for probable 
cause hearings, together with a copy of the warrant application for each 
releasee, shall be sent to the D.C. Public Defender Service. At or 
before the probable cause hearing, the releasee (or the releasee's 
attorney) may submit a written request that the hearing be postponed for 
any period up to thirty days, and the Commission shall ordinarily grant 
such requests. Prior to the commencement of the probable cause hearing, 
the examiner shall advise the releasee that the releasee may accept 
representation by the attorney from the D.C. Public Defender Service who 
is assigned to that docket, waive the assistance of an attorney at the 
probable cause hearing, or have the probable cause hearing postponed in 
order to obtain another attorney and/or witnesses on his behalf. In 
addition, the releasee may request the Commission to require the 
attendance of adverse witnesses (i.e., witnesses who have given 
information upon which revocation may be based) at a postponed probable 
cause hearing. Such adverse witnesses may be required to attend either a 
postponed probable cause hearing, or a combined postponed probable cause 
and local revocation hearing, provided the releasee meets the 
requirements of Sec. 2.215(a) for a local revocation hearing. The 
releasee shall also be given notice of the time and place of any 
postponed probable cause hearing.
    (c) Review of the charges. At the beginning of the probable cause 
hearing, the examiner shall ascertain that the notice required by Sec. 
2.212(b) has been given to the releasee. The examiner shall then review 
the violation charges with the releasee and shall apprise the releasee 
of the evidence that has been submitted in support of the charges. The 
examiner shall ascertain whether the releasee admits or denies each 
charge listed on the warrant application (or other notice of charges), 
and shall offer the releasee an opportunity to rebut or explain the 
allegations contained in the evidence giving rise to each charge. The 
examiner shall also receive the statements of any witnesses and 
documentary evidence that may be presented by the releasee. At a 
postponed probable cause hearing, the examiner shall also permit the 
releasee to confront and cross-examine any adverse witnesses in 
attendance, unless good cause is found for not allowing confrontation. 
Whenever a probable cause hearing is postponed to secure the appearance 
of adverse witnesses (or counsel in the case of a probable cause hearing 
conducted outside the District of Columbia), the Commission will 
ordinarily order a combined probable cause and local revocation hearing 
as provided in paragraph (i) of this section.
    (d) Probable cause determination. At the conclusion of the probable 
cause hearing, the examiner shall determine whether probable cause 
exists to believe that the releasee has violated the conditions of 
release as charged, and shall so inform the releasee. The examiner shall 
then take either of the following actions:
    (1) If the examiner determines that no probable cause exists for any 
violation charge, the examiner shall order that the releasee be released 
from the custody of the warrant and either reinstated to supervision, or 
discharged from supervision if the term of supervised release has 
expired.
    (2) If the hearing examiner determines that probable cause exists on 
any violation charge, and the releasee has requested (and is eligible 
for) a local revocation hearing in the District of Columbia as provided 
by Sec. 2.215(a), the examiner shall schedule a local revocation 
hearing for a date that is within 65 days of the releasee's arrest. 
After the probable cause hearing, the releasee (or the releasee's 
attorney) may submit a written request for a postponement. Such 
postponements will normally be granted if the request is received no 
later than fifteen days before the date of the revocation hearing. A 
request for a postponement that is received by the Commission less than 
fifteen days before the scheduled date of the revocation hearing will be 
granted only for a compelling reason.

[[Page 197]]

The releasee (or the releasee's attorney) may also request, in writing, 
a hearing date that is earlier than the date scheduled by the examiner, 
and the Commission will accommodate such request if practicable.
    (e) Institutional revocation hearing. If the releasee is not 
eligible for a local revocation hearing as provided by Sec. 2.215(a), 
or has requested to be transferred to an institution for his revocation 
hearing, the Commission will request the Bureau of Prisons to designate 
the releasee to an appropriate institution, and an institutional 
revocation hearing shall be scheduled for a date that is within 90 days 
of the releasee's retaking.
    (f) Digest of the probable cause hearing. At the conclusion of the 
probable cause hearing, the examiner shall prepare a digest summarizing 
the evidence presented at the hearing, the responses of the releasee, 
and the examiner's findings as to probable cause.
    (g) Release notwithstanding probable cause. Notwithstanding a 
finding of probable cause, the Commission may order the releasee's 
reinstatement to supervision or release pending further proceedings, if 
it determines that:
    (1) Continuation of revocation proceedings is not warranted despite 
the finding of probable cause; or
    (2) Incarceration pending further revocation proceedings is not 
warranted by the frequency or seriousness of the alleged violation(s), 
and the releasee is neither likely to fail to appear for further 
proceedings, nor is a danger to himself or others.
    (h) Conviction as probable cause. Conviction of any crime committed 
subsequent to the commencement of a term of supervised release shall 
constitute probable cause for the purposes of this section, and no 
probable cause hearing shall be conducted unless a hearing is needed to 
consider additional violation charges that may be determinative of the 
Commission's decision whether to revoke supervised release.
    (i) Combined probable cause and local revocation hearing. A 
postponed probable cause hearing may be conducted as a combined probable 
cause and local revocation hearing, provided such hearing is conducted 
within 65 days of the releasee's arrest and the releasee has been 
notified that the postponed probable cause hearing will constitute the 
final revocation hearing. The Commission's policy is to conduct a 
combined probable cause and local revocation hearing whenever adverse 
witnesses are required to appear and give testimony with respect to 
contested charges.
    (j) Late received charges. If the Commission is notified of an 
additional charge after probable cause has been found to proceed with a 
revocation hearing, the Commission may:
    (1) Remand the case for a supplemental probable cause hearing to 
determine if the new charge is contested by the releasee and if 
witnesses must be presented at the revocation hearing;
    (2) Notify the releasee that the additional charge will be 
considered at the revocation hearing without conducting a supplemental 
probable cause hearing; or
    (3) Determine that the new charge shall not be considered at the 
revocation hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 2.215  Place of revocation hearing.

    (a) If the releasee requests a local revocation hearing, the 
releasee shall be given a revocation hearing reasonably near the place 
of the alleged violation(s) or arrest, with the opportunity to contest 
the violation charges, if the following conditions are met:
    (1) The releasee has not been convicted of a crime committed while 
under supervision; and
    (2) The releasee denies all violation charges.
    (b) The releasee shall also be given a local revocation hearing if 
the releasee admits (or has been convicted of) one or more charged 
violations, but denies at least one unadjudicated charge that may be 
determinative of the Commission's decision regarding revocation or the 
length of any new term of imprisonment, and the releasee requests the 
presence of one or more adverse witnesses regarding that contested 
charge. If the appearance of such witnesses at the hearing is precluded 
by the Commission for good cause, a local revocation hearing shall not 
be ordered.
    (c) If there are two or more contested charges, a local revocation 
hearing may be conducted near the place of the violation chiefly relied 
upon by the

[[Page 198]]

Commission as a basis for the issuance of the warrant or summons.
    (d)(1) A releasee shall be given an institutional revocation hearing 
upon the releasee's return or recommitment to an institution if the 
releasee:
    (i) Voluntarily waives the right to a local revocation hearing; or
    (ii) Admits (or has been convicted of) one or more charged 
violations without contesting any unadjudicated charge that may be 
determinative of the Commission's decision regarding revocation and/or 
imposition of a new term of imprisonment.
    (2) An institutional revocation hearing may also be conducted in the 
District of Columbia jail or prison facility in which the releasee is 
being held. On his own motion, a Commissioner may designate any case 
described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section for a local revocation 
hearing. The difference in procedures between a ``local revocation 
hearing'' and an ``institutional revocation hearing'' is set forth in 
Sec. 2.216(b).
    (e) Unless the Commission orders release notwithstanding a probable 
cause finding under Sec. 2.214(g), a releasee who is retaken on a 
warrant issued by the Commission shall remain in custody until a 
decision is made on the revocation of the term of supervised release. A 
releasee who has been given a revocation hearing pursuant to the 
issuance of a summons shall remain on supervision pending the decision 
of the Commission, unless the Commission has ordered otherwise.
    (f) A local revocation hearing shall be held not later than 65 days 
from the retaking of the releasee on a supervised release violation 
warrant. An institutional revocation hearing shall be held within 90 
days of the retaking of the releasee on a supervised release violation 
warrant. If the releasee requests and receives any postponement, or 
consents to any postponement, or by his actions otherwise precludes the 
prompt completion of revocation proceedings in his case, the above-
stated time limits shall be correspondingly extended.
    (g) A local revocation hearing may be conducted by a hearing 
examiner or by any federal, state, or local official who is designated 
by a Commissioner to be the presiding hearing officer. An institutional 
revocation hearing may be conducted by a hearing examiner.


<R05>
Sec. 2.216  Revocation hearing procedure.

    (a) The purpose of the revocation hearing shall be to determine 
whether the releasee has violated the conditions of the term of 
supervised release, and, if so, whether the term should be revoked or 
the releasee restored to supervised release.
    (b) At a local revocation hearing, the alleged violator may present 
voluntary witnesses and documentary evidence. The alleged violator may 
also request the Commission to compel the attendance of any adverse 
witnesses for cross-examination, and any other relevant witnesses who 
have not volunteered to attend. At an institutional revocation hearing, 
the alleged violator may present voluntary witnesses and documentary 
evidence, but may not request the Commission to secure the attendance of 
any adverse or favorable witness. At any hearing, the presiding hearing 
officer may limit or exclude any irrelevant or repetitious statement or 
documentary evidence, and may prohibit the releasee from contesting 
matters already adjudicated against him in other forums.
    (c) At a local revocation hearing, the Commission shall, on the 
request of the alleged violator, require the attendance of any adverse 
witnesses who have given statements upon which revocation may be based, 
subject to a finding of good cause as described in paragraph (d) of this 
section. The adverse witnesses who are present shall be made available 
for questioning and cross-examination in the presence of the alleged 
violator. The Commission may also require the attendance of adverse 
witnesses on its own motion.
    (d) The Commission may excuse any requested adverse witness from 
appearing at the hearing (or from appearing in the presence of the 
alleged violator) if the Commission finds good cause for so doing. A 
finding of good cause for the non-appearance of a requested adverse 
witness may be based, for example, on a significant possibility of harm 
to the witness, or the witness not being reasonably available when the 
Commission has documentary evidence that

[[Page 199]]

is an adequate substitute for live testimony.
    (e) All evidence upon which a finding of violation may be based 
shall be disclosed to the alleged violator before the revocation 
hearing. Such evidence shall include the community supervision officer's 
letter summarizing the releasee's adjustment to supervision and 
requesting the warrant, all other documents describing the charged 
violation or violations, and any additional evidence upon which the 
Commission intends to rely in determining whether the charged violation 
or violations, if sustained, would warrant revocation of supervised 
release. If the releasee is represented by an attorney, the attorney 
shall be provided, prior to the revocation hearing, with a copy of the 
releasee's presentence investigation report, if such report is available 
to the Commission. If disclosure of any information would reveal the 
identity of a confidential informant or result in harm to any person, 
that information may be withheld from disclosure, in which case a 
summary of the withheld information shall be disclosed to the releasee 
prior to the revocation hearing.
    (f) An alleged violator may be represented by an attorney at either 
a local or an institutional revocation hearing. In lieu of an attorney, 
an alleged violator may be represented at any revocation hearing by a 
person of his choice. However, the role of such non-attorney 
representative shall be limited to offering a statement on the alleged 
violator's behalf. Only licensed attorneys shall be permitted to 
question witnesses, make objections, and otherwise provide legal 
representation for supervised releasees, except in the case of law 
students appearing before the Commission as part of a court-approved 
clinical practice program. Such law students must be under the personal 
direction of a lawyer or law professor who is physically present at the 
hearing, and the examiner shall ascertain that the releasee consents to 
the procedure.
    (g) At a local revocation hearing, the Commission shall secure the 
presence of the releasee's community supervision officer, or a 
substitute community supervision officer who shall bring the releasee's 
supervision file if the releasee's community supervision officer is not 
available. At the request of the hearing examiner, such officer shall 
provide testimony at the hearing concerning the releasee's adjustment to 
supervision.
    (h) After the revocation hearing, the hearing examiner shall prepare 
a summary of the hearing that includes a description of the evidence 
against the releasee and the evidence submitted by the releasee in 
defense or mitigation of the charges, a summary of the arguments against 
revocation presented by the releasee, and the examiner's recommended 
decision. The hearing examiner's summary, together with the releasee's 
file (including any documentary evidence and letters submitted on behalf 
of the releasee), shall be given to another examiner for review. When 
two hearing examiners concur in a recommended disposition, that 
recommendation, together with the releasee's file and the hearing 
examiner's summary of the hearing, shall be submitted to the Commission 
for decision.


<R05>
Sec. 2.217  Issuance of subpoena for appearance of witnesses or production of 

documents.

    (a)(1) If any adverse witness (i.e., a person who has given 
information upon which revocation may be based) refuses, upon request by 
the Commission, to appear at a probable cause hearing or local 
revocation hearing, a Commissioner may issue a subpoena for the 
appearance of such witness.
    (2) In addition, a Commissioner may, upon a showing by the releasee 
that a witness whose testimony is necessary to the proper disposition of 
his case will not appear voluntarily at a local revocation hearing or 
provide an adequate written statement of his testimony, issue a subpoena 
for the appearance of such witness at the revocation hearing.
    (3) A subpoena may also be issued at the discretion of a 
Commissioner if an adverse witness is judged unlikely to appear as 
requested, or if the subpoena is deemed necessary for the orderly 
processing of the case.
    (b) A subpoena may require the production of documents as well as, 
or in

[[Page 200]]

lieu of, a personal appearance. The subpoena shall specify the time and 
the place at which the person named therein is commanded to appear, and 
shall specify any documents required to be produced.
    (c) A subpoena may be served by any Federal or District of Columbia 
officer authorized to serve criminal process. The subpoena may be served 
at any place within the judicial district in which the place specified 
in the subpoena is located, or any place where the witness may be found. 
Service of a subpoena upon a person named therein shall be made by 
delivering a copy of the subpoena to such a person.
    (d) If a person refuses to obey such subpoena, the Commission may 
petition a court of the United States for the judicial district in which 
the revocation proceeding is being conducted, or in which such person 
may be found, to require such person to appear, testify, or produce 
evidence. If the court issues an order requiring such person to appear 
before the Commission, failure to obey such an order is punishable as 
contempt, as provided in 18 U.S.C. 4214(a)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 2.218  Revocation decisions.

    (a) Whenever a releasee is summoned or retaken by the Commission, 
and the Commission finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the 
releasee has violated one or more conditions of supervised release, the 
Commission may take any of the following actions:
    (1) Restore the releasee to supervision, and where appropriate:
    (i) Reprimand the releasee;
    (ii) Modify the releasee's conditions of release;
    (iii) Refer the releasee to a residential community corrections 
center for all or part of the remainder of the term of supervised 
release; or
    (2) Revoke the term of supervised release.
    (b) If supervised release is revoked, the Commission shall determine 
whether the releasee shall be returned to prison to serve a new term of 
imprisonment, and the length of that term, or whether a new term of 
imprisonment shall be imposed but limited to time served. If the 
Commission imposes a new term of imprisonment that is less than the 
applicable maximum term of imprisonment authorized by law, the 
Commission shall also determine whether to impose a further term of 
supervised release to commence after the new term of imprisonment has 
been served. If the new term of imprisonment is limited to time served, 
any further term of supervised release shall commence upon the issuance 
of the Commission's order. Notwithstanding the above, if a releasee is 
serving another term of imprisonment of 30 days or more in connection 
with a conviction for a federal, state, or local crime (including a term 
of imprisonment resulting from a probation, parole, or supervised 
release revocation), a further term of supervised release imposed by the 
Commission under this paragraph shall not commence until that term of 
imprisonment has been served.
    (c) A releasee whose term of supervised release is revoked by the 
Commission shall receive no credit for time spent on supervised release, 
including any time spent in confinement on other sentences (or in a 
halfway house as a condition of supervised release) prior to the 
execution of the Commission's warrant.
    (d) The Commission's decision regarding the imposition of a term of 
imprisonment following revocation of supervised release, and any further 
term of supervised release, shall be made pursuant to the limitations 
set forth in Sec. 2.219. Within those limitations, the appropriate 
length of any term of imprisonment shall be determined by reference to 
the guidelines at Sec. 2.21. If the term of imprisonment authorized 
under Sec. 2.219 is less than the minimum of the appropriate guideline 
range determined under Sec. 2.21, the term authorized under Sec. 2.219 
shall be the guideline range.
    (e) Whenever the Commission imposes a term of imprisonment upon 
revocation of supervised release that is less than the authorized 
maximum term of imprisonment, it shall be the Commission's general 
policy to impose a further term of supervised release that is the 
maximum term of supervised release permitted by Sec. 2.219. If the

[[Page 201]]

Commission imposes a new term of imprisonment that is equal to the 
maximum term of imprisonment authorized by law (or in the case of a 
subsequent revocation, that uses up the remainder of the maximum term of 
imprisonment authorized by law), the Commission may not impose a further 
term of supervised release.
    (f) Where deemed appropriate, the Commission may depart from the 
guidelines at Sec. 2.21 (with respect to the imposition of a new term 
of imprisonment) in order to permit the imposition of a further term of 
supervised release.
    (g) Decisions under this section shall be made upon the vote of one 
Commissioner, except that a decision to override an examiner panel 
recommendation shall require the concurrence of two Commissioners. The 
final decision following a local revocation hearing shall be issued 
within 86 days of the retaking of the releasee on a supervised release 
violation warrant. The final decision following an institutional 
revocation hearing shall be issued within 21 days of the hearing, 
excluding weekends and holidays.

Sec. 2.219  Maximum terms of imprisonment and supervised release.

    (a) Imprisonment; first revocation. When a term of supervised 
release is revoked, the maximum authorized term of imprisonment that the 
Commission may require the offender to serve, in accordance with D.C. 
Code 24-403.01(b)(7), is determined by reference to the maximum 
authorized term of imprisonment for the offense of conviction. The 
maximum authorized term of imprisonment at the first revocation shall 
be:
    (1) Five years, if the maximum term of imprisonment authorized for 
the offense is life, or if the offense is statutorily designated as a 
Class A felony;
    (2) Three years, if the maximum term of imprisonment authorized for 
the offense is 25 years or more, but less than life, and the offense is 
not statutorily designated as a Class A felony;
    (3) Two years, if the maximum term of imprisonment authorized for 
the offense is 5 years or more, but less than 25 years; or
    (4) One year, if the maximum term of imprisonment authorized for the 
offense is less than 5 years.
    (b) Further term of supervised release; first revocation. (1) When a 
term of supervised release is revoked, and the Commission imposes less 
than the maximum term of imprisonment permitted by paragraph (a) of this 
section, the Commission may also impose a further term of supervised 
release after imprisonment. A term of imprisonment is ``less than the 
maximum authorized term of imprisonment'' if the term is one day or more 
shorter than the maximum authorized term of imprisonment.
    (2) The maximum authorized length of such further term of supervised 
release shall be the original maximum term of supervised release that 
the sentencing court was authorized to impose for the offense of 
conviction, less the term of imprisonment imposed by the Commission upon 
revocation of supervised release. The original maximum authorized term 
of supervised release is as follows:
    (i) Five years if the maximum term of imprisonment authorized for 
the offense is 25 years or more;
    (ii) Three years if the maximum term of imprisonment authorized for 
the offense is more than one year but less than 25 years; and
    (iii) Life if the person is required to register for life, and 10 
years in any other case, if the offender has been sentenced for an 
offense for which registration is required by the Sex Offender 
Registration Act of 1999.
    (3) For example, if the maximum authorized term of imprisonment at 
the first revocation is three years and the original maximum authorized 
term of supervised release is five years, the Commission may impose a 
three-year term of imprisonment with no supervised release to follow, or 
any term of imprisonment of less than three years with a further term of 
supervised release of five years minus the term of imprisonment actually 
imposed (such as a one-year term of imprisonment followed by a four-year 
term of supervised release, or a two-year term of imprisonment followed 
by a three-year term of supervised release).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes: (1) An asterisk next to the offense description indicates that the offense is statutorily designated as a
  Class A felony.
(2) If the defendant must register as a sex offender, the Original Maximum Authorized Term of Supervised Release
  is the maximum period for which the offender may be required to register as a sex offender under D.C. Code 22-
  4002(a) and (b) (ten years or life). See D.C. Code 24-403.01(b)(4). Sex offender registration is required for
  crimes such as first degree sexual abuse, and these crimes are listed in this table with the notation ``10
  years if SOR'' or ``life if SOR'' as the Original Maximum Authorized Term of Supervised Release. Sex offender
  registration, however, may also be required for numerous crimes (such as burglary or murder) if a sexual act
  or contact was involved or was the offender's purpose. In such cases, the offender's status will be determined
  by the presence of an order from the sentencing judge certifying that the defendant is a sex offender.
(3) If the defendant committed the offense before 5 p.m., August 11, 2000, the maximum authorized terms of
  imprisonment and supervised release shall be determined by reference to 18 U.S.C. 3583.


    (d) Imprisonment; successive revocations. (1) When the Commission 
revokes a term of supervised release that was imposed by the Commission 
after a previous revocation of supervised release, the maximum 
authorized term of imprisonment is the maximum term of imprisonment 
permitted by paragraph (a) of this section, less the term or terms of 
imprisonment that were previously imposed by the Commission. In 
calculating such previously-imposed term or terms of imprisonment, the 
Commission shall use the term as imposed without deducting any good time 
credits that may have been earned by the offender prior to his release 
from prison. In no case shall the total of successive terms of 
imprisonment imposed by the Commission exceed the maximum authorized 
term of imprisonment at the first revocation.
    (2) For example, if the maximum authorized term of imprisonment at 
the first revocation is three years and the original maximum authorized 
term of supervised release is five years, the Commission at the first 
revocation may have imposed a one-year term of imprisonment and a 
further four-year term of supervised release. At the second revocation, 
the maximum authorized term of imprisonment will be two years, i.e., the 
maximum authorized term of imprisonment at the first revocation (three 
years) minus the one-year term of imprisonment that was imposed at the 
first revocation.
    (e) Further term of supervised release; successive revocations. (1) 
When the Commission revokes a term of supervised release that was 
imposed by the Commission following a previous revocation of supervised 
release, the Commission may also impose a further term of supervised 
release. The maximum authorized length of such a term of supervised 
release shall be the original maximum authorized term of supervised 
release permitted by paragraph (b) of this section, less the total of 
the terms of imprisonment imposed

[[Page 208]]

by the Commission on the same sentence (including the term of 
imprisonment imposed in the current revocation).
    (2) For example, if the maximum authorized term of imprisonment at 
the first revocation is three years and the original maximum authorized 
term of supervised release is five years, the Commission at the first 
revocation may have imposed a one-year term of imprisonment and a four-
year further term of supervised release. If, at a second revocation, the 
Commission imposes another one-year term of imprisonment, the maximum 
authorized further term of supervised release will be three years (the 
original five-year period minus the total of two years of imprisonment).
    (f) Effect of sentencing court imposing less than the original 
maximum authorized term of supervised release. If the Commission has 
revoked supervised release, the maximum authorized period of further 
supervised release is determined by reference to the original maximum 
authorized term permitted for the offense of conviction (see paragraph 
(b) of this section), even if the sentencing court did not impose the 
original maximum authorized term permitted for the offense of 
conviction.


<R05>
Sec. 2.220  Appeal.

    A supervised releasee may appeal to the Commission a decision to 
revoke supervised release, impose a term of imprisonment, or impose a 
new term of supervised release after revocation. The provisions of Sec. 
2.26 on the time limits for filing and deciding the appeal, the grounds 
for appeal, the format of the appeal, the limits regarding the 
submission of exhibits, and voting requirements apply to an appeal 
submitted under this section.

order of any court suspending, enjoining, restraining, or disbarring him 
from, or otherwise restricting him in, the practice of law. Whenever a 
person acting in a representative capacity appears in person or signs a 
paper in practice before the Commission, his personal appearance or 
signature shall constitute a representation to the Commission that under 
the provisions of this part and applicable law he is authorized and 
qualified to represent the particular person in whose behalf he acts.

and/or the Administrative Procedures Act shall be made parts of the 
record for decision.
    (b) At the conclusion of the hearing the presiding officer shall 
specify the time for submission of proposed findings of fact and 
conclusions of law (unless waived by the parties); transcript of the 
hearing, and supplemental exhibits, if any. He shall set a tentative 
date for the recommended decision based upon the timing of these 
preliminary steps. Extensions of time may be requested by any party, in 
writing, from the Parole Commission. Failure of any party to comply with 
the time frame as established or extended will be deemed to be a waiver 
on his part of his right to submit the document in question. The 
adjudication will proceed and the absence of said document and reasons 
therefor will be noted in the record.


<R05>
Sec. 4.14  Administrative law judge's recommended decision; exceptions

prospective employer named in the application.


<R05>
Sec. 4.16  Rejection of application.

months.

<R05>
Sec. 5.2  Inquiries concerning application of the Act.

    (a) General. Any present or prospective agent of a foreign 
principal, or the agent's attorney, may request from the Assistant 
Attorney General for National Security a statement of the present 
enforcement intentions of the Department of Justice under the Act with 
respect to any presently contemplated activity, course of conduct, 
expenditure, receipt of money or thing of value, or transaction, and 
specifically with respect to whether the same requires registration and 
disclosure pursuant to the Act, or is excluded from coverage or exempted 
from registration and disclosure under any provision of the Act.
    (b) Anonymous, hypothetical, non-party and ex post facto review 
requests excluded. The entire transaction which is the subject of the 
review request must be an actual, as opposed to hypothetical, 
transaction and involve disclosed, as opposed to anonymous, agents and 
principals. Review requests must be submitted by a party to the 
transaction or the party's attorney, and have no application to a party 
that does not join in the request. A review request may not involve only 
past conduct.
    (c) Fee. All requests for statements of the Department's present 
enforcement intentions must be accompanied by a non-refundable filing 
fee submitted in accordance with Sec. 5.5.
    (d) Address. A review request must be submitted in writing to the 
Assistant Attorney General for National Security, Department of Justice, 
Washington, DC 20530.
    (e) Contents. A review request shall be specific and contain in 
detail all relevant and material information bearing on the actual 
activity, course of conduct, expenditure, receipt of money or thing of 
value, or transaction for which review is requested. There is no 
prescribed format for the request, but each request must include:
    (1) The identity(ies) of the agent(s) and foreign principal(s) 
involved;
    (2) The nature of the agent's activities for or in the interest of 
the foreign principal;
    (3) A copy of the existing or proposed written contract with the 
foreign principal or a full description of the terms and conditions of 
each existing or proposed oral agreement; and
    (4) The applicable statutory or regulatory basis for the exemption 
or exclusion claimed.
    (f) Certification. If the requesting party is an individual, the 
review request must be signed by the prospective or current agent, or, 
if the requesting party is not an individual, the review request must be 
signed on behalf of each requesting party by an officer, a director, a 
person performing the functions of an officer or a director of, or an 
attorney for, the requesting party. Each such person signing the review 
request must certify that the review request contains a true, correct 
and complete disclosure with respect to the proposed conduct.
    (g) Additional information. Each party shall provide any additional 
information or documents the National Security Division may thereafter 
request in order to review a matter. Any information furnished orally 
shall be confirmed promptly in writing, signed by the same person who 
signed the initial review request and certified to be a true, correct 
and complete disclosure of the requested information.
    (h) Outcomes. After submission of a review request, the National 
Security Division, in its discretion, may state its present enforcement 
intention under the Act with respect to the proposed conduct; may 
decline to state its present enforcement intention; or, if circumstances 
warrant, may take such other position or initiate such other action as 
it considers appropriate. Any

[[Page 215]]

requesting party or parties may withdraw a review request at any time. 
The National Security Division remains free, however, to submit such 
comments to the requesting party or parties as it deems appropriate. 
Failure to take action after receipt of a review request, documents or 
information, whether submitted pursuant to this procedure or otherwise, 
shall not in any way limit or stop the National Security Division from 
taking any action at such time thereafter as it deems appropriate. The 
National Security Division reserves the right to retain any review 
request, document or information submitted to it under this procedure or 
otherwise and to use any such request, document or information for any 
governmental purpose.
    (i) Time for response. The National Security Division shall respond 
to any review request within 30 days after receipt of the review request 
and of any requested additional information and documents.
    (j) Written decisions only. The requesting party or parties may rely 
only upon a written Foreign Agents Registration Act review letter signed 
by the Assistant Attorney General for National Security or his delegate.
    (k) Effect of review letter. Each review letter can be relied upon 
by the requesting party or parties to the extent the disclosure was 
accurate and complete and to the extent the disclosure continues 
accurately and completely to reflect circumstances after the date of 
issuance of the review letter.
    (l) Compliance. Neither the submission of a review request, nor its 
pendency, shall in any way alter the responsibility of the party or 
parties to comply with the Act.
    (m) Confidentiality. Any written material submitted pursuant to a 
request made under this section shall be treated as confidential and 
shall be exempt from disclosure.

compromise, and matters relating to bonds or other security.

[[Page 226]]


<R05>
Sec. 8.4  Custody of seized property, inventory and receipt.

    All property seized pursuant to the statutes identified in Sec. 8.1 
shall be turned over to the U.S. Marshals Service when not held as 
evidence or to be placed into official use following forfeiture. An 
inventory shall be prepared by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of 
the seized property and a receipt given for it to the person from whom 
it was seized at the time of seizure or as soon thereafter as practical.


<R05>
Sec. 8.5  Appraisement of property subject to forfeiture.

    Seized property shall be appraised. The appraisement shall be the 
function of the Special Agent in Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation 
or his designee having custody of the property. The value of an article 
seized shall be the price at which it or a similar article is fairly 
offered for sale at the time and place of appraisement.


<R05>
Sec. 8.6  Quick-release authority.

    Where the forfeiture proceedings are administrative, the Special 
Agent in Charge, prior to forfeiture, is authorized to release property 
seized for forfeiture. The property can be quick-released when the 
Special Agent in Charge deems that there is an innocent owner having an 
immediate right to possession of the property or when the release would 
be in the best interest of justice and the Government.


<R05>
Sec. 8.7  Judicial forfeiture.

    If the appraised value exceeds the monetary amount set forth in 
title 19, United States Code, section 1607, or a claim and satisfactory 
bond have been received either for property appraised at that amount or 
less, or for seized merchandise which is any monetary instrument within 
the meaning of section 5312(a)(3) of title 31 of the United States Code, 
the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI field office that seized the 
property shall transmit the claim and bond to the U.S. Attorney for the 
judicial district in which the seizure was made for the purpose of 
instituting judicial forfeiture proceedings. Also transmitted with the 
claim and bond will be a description of the property and a complete 
statement of the facts and circumstances leading to the seizure of the 
property.

[Order No. 1476-91, 56 FR 8685, Mar. 1, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 8.8  Advertisement and declaration of forfeiture.

    (a) The notice required by customs laws, section 607, Tariff Act of 
1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1607), of seizure and intention to forfeit 
and sell or otherwise dispose of property seized pursuant to the 
statutes identified in Sec. 8.1, shall describe the property seized, 
state the date seized, cause, and place of seizure; and state that any 
person desiring to claim the property must file with the Special Agent 
in Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) within 20 days from the 
date of the first publication of the notice a claim to such property and 
a bond.
    (b) The bond amount shall be $5,000 or ten percent of the value of 
the claimed property whichever is lower, but not less than $250. The 
bond posted to cover costs may be in cash, certified check, or 
satisfactory sureties. When the claim and bond are received by the 
Special Agent in Charge, he shall, after finding the documents in proper 
form and the sureties satisfactory, transmit the documents, together 
with a description of the property and a complete statement of the facts 
and circumstances surrounding the seizure, to the U.S. Attorney for the 
judicial district in which the seizure was made for purpose of 
proceeding to forfeiture of the property in a manner prescribed by law. 
If the documents are not in satisfactory condition when first received, 
a reasonable time for correction may be allowed. If correction is not 
made within a reasonable time, the documents may be treated as nugatory, 
and the administrative forfeiture shall proceed as though they had not 
been tendered. The filing of the claim and the posting of the bond does 
not entitle the claimant to possession of the property, however, it does 
stop the administrative forfeiture proceeding.
    (c) The notice for administrative forfeiture proceedings shall be 
published once each week for at least three successive weeks in a 
newspaper of general circulation in the judicial district in which the 
property was seized. If a

[[Page 227]]

claim is not made within the time period, the FBI Property Management 
Officer shall declare the property forfeited.

[Order No. 1128-86, 51 FR 8818, Mar. 14, 1986, as amended by Order No. 
1197-87, 52 FR 24448, July 1, 1987; Order No. 1476-91, 56 FR 8687, Mar. 
1, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 8.9  Disposition of forfeited property.

    (a) If the laws of a state in which an article of forfeited property 
is located prohibit the sale of such property or if the U.S. Marshals 
Service is of the opinion that it would be more advantageous to sell the 
forfeited property in another district, the property may be moved to and 
sold in such other district as the U.S. Marshals Service may direct.
    (b) If, after the administrative forfeiture of property is 
completed, it appears that the proceeds of sale will not be sufficient 
to pay the costs of sale or the proceeds will be insignificant in 
relation to the expenses involved in the forfeiture, the U.S. Marshals 
Service may order the destruction of the property. Similarly, property 
forfeited under a decree of a court may be destroyed in accordance with 
section 611, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1611). Also, if the sale or 
use of any article is prohibited under any law of the United States or 
the state where it is stored, the U.S. Marshals Service may order it 
destroyed or cause alteration of the property into an article that is 
not prohibited.
    (c) If arms and munitions are forfeited pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 
401(c), the Secretary of Defense should be contacted to determine if he 
desires this property.


<R05>
Sec. 8.10  Remission or mitigation of forfeiture.

    (a) Any person claiming a legal or equitable interest in any 
property which has been forfeited pursuant to statutes identified in 
Sec. 8.1, may file, in accordance with the provisions of 28 CFR part 9, 
a petition for remission or mitigation of the forfeiture or a petition 
for restoration of the proceeds of sale or for value of the property 
placed in official use. If the foreiture proceedings are administrative, 
the petition shall be addressed to the Director of the FBI and shall be 
filed in triplicate with the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI field 
office that seized the property. It must be executed and sworn to by the 
person alleging interest in the property. If the forfeiture proceedings 
are judicial, the petition shall be addressed to the Attorney General of 
the United States and filed in triplicate with the Special Agent in 
Charge of the FBI field office that seized the property. The petition 
for a judicial forfeiture shall be sworn to by the petitioner, or by his 
or her counsel upon information and belief.
    (b) The petition shall include the following:
    (1) A complete description of the property, including model and 
serial numbers, if any, and the date and place of seizure;
    (2) The petitioner's interest in the property, which shall be 
supported by bills of sale, contracts, mortgages, or other satisfactory 
documentary evidence; and,
    (3) The facts and circumstances, established by satisfactory proof, 
relied upon by the petitioner to justify remission or mitigation of the 
forfeiture. For further information regarding the content of a petition, 
see 28 CFR 9.5.
    (c) Where the petition is for restoration of the proceeds of sale, 
or for value of the property placed in official use, it must be 
supported by satisfactory proof that the petitioner did not know of the 
seizure prior to the declaration of forfeiture and was in such 
circumstances as prevented petitioner from knowing of the same.
    (d) A petition for remission or mitigation of forfeiture should be 
filed within 30 days of the receipt of the notice of seizure. Once 
forfeited property is disposed of, a petition for remission or 
mitigation of forfeiture will no longer be accepted. A petition for 
restoration of proceeds of sale or for value of the property placed in 
official use must be filed within 90 days of the sale of the property, 
or within 90 days of the date the property is placed in official use.
    (e) Upon receipt of a petition, an appropriate investigation shall 
be conducted by the FBI. No hearing shall be held. For administrative 
forfeitures,

[[Page 228]]

the petition and the results of the petition investigation shall be 
forwarded to the Legal Counsel Division, FBI. Final decisions on 
petitions for property forfeited administratively shall be made by the 
Assistant Director, Legal Counsel, FBI or his designee within the Legal 
Counsel Division, FBI. For judicial forfeitures, the petition and the 
results of the petition investigation shall be forwarded to the U.S. 
Attorney who prosecuted the property. The U.S. Attorney shall forward 
the petition and the results of the investigation together with a 
recommendation as to allowance or denial of the petition to the 
Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division. The matter shall be 
assigned to the Asset Forfeiture Office who shall either grant the 
petition by remission or mitigation of the forfeiture or shall deny it.
    (f) A request for reconsideration of the denial of the petition for 
an administrative forfeiture must be submitted within 10 days from 
receipt of the letter denying the petition. Such request shall be 
addressed to the Director of the FBI for referral to the FBI Legal 
Counsel Division and shall be based on evidence recently developed or 
not previously considered. Only one request for reconsideration of a 
denial of a petition shall be considered. For further information 
regarding petitions see 28 CFR part 9.

Sec. 9.1  Authority, purpose, and scope.

    (a) Purpose. This part sets forth the procedures for agency 
officials to follow when considering remission or mitigation of 
administrative forfeitures under the jurisdiction of the agency, and 
civil judicial and criminal judicial forfeitures under the jurisdiction 
of the Criminal Division. The purpose of the regulations in this part is 
to provide a basis for ameliorating the effects of forfeiture through 
the partial or total remission of forfeiture for individuals who have an 
interest in the forfeited property but who did not participate in, or 
have knowledge of, the conduct that resulted in the property being 
subject to forfeiture and, where required, took all reasonable steps 
under the circumstances to ensure that such property would not be used, 
acquired, or disposed of contrary to law. Additionally, the regulations 
provide for partial or total mitigation of the forfeiture and imposition 
of alternative conditions in appropriate circumstances.
    (b) Authority to grant remission and mitigation. (1) Remission and 
mitigation functions in administrative forfeitures are performed by the 
agency seizing the property. Within the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 
authority to grant remission and mitigation is delegated to the 
Forfeiture Counsel, who is the Unit Chief, Legal Forfeiture Unit, Office 
of the General Counsel; within the Drug Enforcement Administration, 
authority to grant remission and mitigation is delegated to the 
Forfeiture Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel; within the Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, authority to grant remission 
and mitigation is delegated to the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; and within the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, authority to grant remission and mitigation is 
delegated to the INS Regional Directors.
    (2) Remission and mitigation functions in judicial cases are 
performed by the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice. Within 
the Criminal Division, authority to grant remission

[[Page 229]]

and mitigation is delegated to the Chief, Asset Forfeiture and Money 
Laundering Section, Criminal Division.
    (3) The powers and responsibilities delegated by these regulations 
in this part may be redelegated to attorneys or managers working under 
the supervision of the designated officials.
    (c) The time periods and internal requirements established in this 
part are designed to guide the orderly administration of the remission 
and mitigation process and are not intended to create rights or 
entitlements in favor of individuals seeking remission or mitigation. 
The regulations will apply to all decisions on petitions for remission 
or mitigation made on or after February 3, 1997. The regulations will 
apply to decisions on requests for reconsideration of a denial of a 
petition under Sec. Sec. 9.3(j) and 9.4(k) only if the initial decision 
on the petition was made under the provisions of this part effective on 
February 3, 1997.
    (d) This part governs any petition for remission filed with the 
Attorney General and supersedes any Department of Justice regulation 
governing petitions for remission, to the extent such regulation is 
inconsistent with this part. In particular, this part supersedes the 
provisions of 21 CFR 1316.79 and 1316.80, which contain remission and 
mitigation procedures for property seized for narcotics violations. The 
provisions of 8 CFR 274.13 through 274.19 and 28 CFR 8.10, which concern 
non-drug related forfeitures, are also superseded by this part where 
those regulations relate to remission and mitigation.

[Order No. 2064-96, 62 FR 316, Jan. 3, 1997, as amended by Order No. 
2650-2003, 68 FR 4928, Jan. 31, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 9.2  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    (a) The term administrative forfeiture means the process by which 
property may be forfeited by an investigative agency rather than through 
judicial proceedings.
    (b) The term appraised value means the estimated market value of an 
asset at the time and place of seizure if such or similar property was 
freely offered for sale between a willing seller and a willing buyer.
    (c) The term Assets Forfeiture Fund means the Department of Justice 
Assets Forfeiture Fund or Department of the Treasury Asset Forfeiture 
Fund, depending upon the identity of the seizing agency.
    (d) The term Attorney General means the Attorney General of the 
United States or his or her designee.
    (e) The term beneficial owner means a person with actual use of, as 
well as an interest in, the property subject to forfeiture.
    (f) The terms Chief, Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section, 
and Chief, refer to the Chief of the Asset Forfeiture and Money 
Laundering Section, Criminal Division, United States Department of 
Justice.
    (g) The term general creditor means one whose claim or debt is not 
secured by a specific right to obtain satisfaction against the 
particular property subject to forfeiture.
    (h) The term judgment creditor means one who has obtained a judgment 
against the debtor but has not yet received full satisfaction of the 
judgment.
    (i) The term judicial forfeiture means either a civil or a criminal 
proceeding in a United States District Court that may result in a final 
judgment and order of forfeiture.
    (j) The term lienholder means a creditor whose claim or debt is 
secured by a specific right to obtain satisfaction against the 
particular property subject to forfeiture. A lien creditor qualifies as 
a lienholder if the lien:
    (1) Was established by operation of law or contract;
    (2) Was created as a result of an exchange of money, goods, or 
services; and
    (3) Is perfected against the specific property forfeited for which 
remission or mitigation is sought (e.g., a real estate mortgage; a 
mechanic's lien).
    (k) The term net equity means the amount of a lienholder's monetary 
interest in property subject to forfeiture. Net equity shall be computed 
by determining the amount of unpaid principal and unpaid interest at the 
time of seizure, and by adding to that sum unpaid interest calculated 
from the date of seizure through the last full month prior to the date 
of the decision on the

[[Page 230]]

petition. Where a rate of interest is set forth in a security agreement, 
the rate of interest to be used in this computation will be the annual 
percentage rate so specified in the security agreement that is the basis 
of the lienholder's interest. In this computation, however, there shall 
be no allowances for attorneys' fees, accelerated or enhanced interest 
charges, amounts set by contract as damages, unearned extended warranty 
fees, insurance, service contract charges incurred after the date of 
seizure, allowances for dealer's reserve, or any other similar charges.
    (l) The term owner means the person in whom primary title is vested 
or whose interest is manifested by the actual and beneficial use of the 
property, even though the title is vested in another. A victim of an 
offense, as defined in paragraph (v) of this section, may also be an 
owner if he or she has a present legally cognizable ownership interest 
in the property forfeited. A nominal owner of property will not be 
treated as its true owner if he or she is not its beneficial owner.
    (m) The term person means an individual, partnership, corporation, 
joint business enterprise, estate, or other legal entity capable of 
owning property.
    (n) The term petition means a petition for remission or mitigation 
of forfeiture under the regulations in this part. This definition 
includes a petition for restoration of the proceeds of sale of forfeited 
property and a petition for the value of forfeited property placed into 
official use.
    (o) The term petitioner means the person applying for remission, 
mitigation, restoration of the proceeds of sale, or for the appraised 
value of forfeited property, under the regulations in this part. A 
petitioner may be an owner as defined in Sec. 9.2(l), a lienholder as 
defined in Sec. 9.2(j), or a victim as defined in Sec. 9.2(v), subject 
to the limitations of Sec. 9.8.
    (p) The term property means real or personal property of any kind 
capable of being owned or possessed.
    (q) The term record means a series of arrests for related crimes, 
unless the arrestee was acquitted or the charges were dismissed for lack 
of evidence; a conviction for a related crime or completion of sentence 
within ten years of the acquisition of the property subject to 
forfeiture; or two convictions for a related crime at any time in the 
past.
    (r) The term related crime as used in Sec. 9.2(q) and Sec. 9.6(e) 
means any crime similar in nature to that which gives rise to the 
seizure of property for forfeiture. For example, where property is 
seized for a violation of the federal laws relating to drugs, a related 
crime would be any offense involving a violation of the federal laws 
relating to drugs or the laws of any state or political subdivision 
thereof relating to drugs.
    (s) The term related offense as used in Sec. 9.8 means:
    (1) Any predicate offense charged in a Federal Racketeer Influenced 
and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) count for which forfeiture was 
ordered; or
    (2) An offense committed as part of the same scheme or design, or 
pursuant to the same conspiracy, as was involved in the offense for 
which forfeiture was ordered.
    (t) The term Ruling Official means any official to whom decision 
making authority has been delegated pursuant to Sec. 9.1(b).
    (u) The term seizing agency means the federal agency that seized the 
property or adopted the seizure of another agency for federal 
forfeiture.
    (v) The term victim means a person who has incurred a pecuniary loss 
as a direct result of the commission of the offense underlying a 
forfeiture. A drug user is not considered a victim of a drug trafficking 
offense under this definition. A victim does not include one who 
acquires a right to sue the perpetrator of the criminal offense for any 
loss by assignment, subrogation inheritance, or otherwise form the 
actual victim, unless that person has acquired an actual ownership 
interest in the forfeited property.
    (w) The term violator means the person whose use or acquisition of 
the property in violation of the law subjected such property to seizure 
for forfeiture.

<R05>
Sec. 9.5  Criteria governing administrative and judicial remission and 

mitigation.

    (a) Remission. (1) The Ruling Official shall not grant remission of 
a forfeiture unless the petitioner establishes that:
    (i) The petitioner has a valid, good faith, and legally cognizable 
interest in the seized property as owner or lienholder as defined in 
this part; and
    (ii) The petitioner is innocent within the meaning of the innocent 
owner provisions of the applicable civil forfeiture statute, is a bona 
fide purchaser for value without cause to believe that the property was 
subject to forfeiture at the time of the purchase, or is one who held a 
legally cognizable interest in the seized property at the time of the 
violation underlying the forfeiture superior to that of the defendant 
within the meaning of the applicable criminal forfeiture statute, and is 
thereby entitled to recover his or her interest in the forfeited 
property by statute. (If the applicable civil forfeiture statute 
contains no innocent owner defense,

[[Page 235]]

the innocent owner provisions applicable to 21 U.S.C. 881(a)(4) shall 
apply.) Unless otherwise provided by statute, in the case of petitioners 
who acquired their interest in the property after the time of the 
violation underlying the forfeiture, the question of whether the 
petitioner had knowledge of the violation shall be determined as of the 
point in time when the interest in the property was acquired.
    (2) The knowledge and responsibilities of petitioner's 
representative, agent, or employee in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this 
section are imputed to the petitioner where the representative, agent, 
or employee was acting in the course of his or her employment and in 
furtherance of the petitioner's business.
    (3) The petitioner has the burden of establishing the basis for 
granting a petition for remission or mitigation of forfeited property, a 
restoration of proceeds of sale or appraised value of forfeited 
property, or a reconsideration of a denial of such a petition. Failure 
to provide information or documents and to submit to interviews, as 
requested, may result in a denial of the petition.
    (4) The Ruling Official shall presume a valid forfeiture and shall 
not consider whether the evidence is sufficient to support the 
forfeiture.
    (5) Willful, materially-false statements or information, made or 
furnished by the petitioner in support of a petition for remission or 
mitigation of forfeited property, the restoration of proceeds or 
appraised value of forfeited property, or the reconsideration of a 
denial of any such petition, shall be grounds for denial of such 
petition and possible prosecution for the filing of false statements.
    (b) Mitigation. (1) The Ruling Official may grant mitigation to a 
party not involved in the commission of the offense underlying 
forfeiture:
    (i) Where the petitioner has not met the minimum conditions for 
remission, but the Ruling Official finds that some relief should be 
granted to avoid extreme hardship, and that return of the property 
combined with imposition of monetary and/or other conditions of 
mitigation in lieu of a complete forfeiture will promote the interest of 
justice and will not diminish the deterrent effect of the law. 
Extenuating circumstances justifying such a finding include those 
circumstances that reduce the responsibility of the petitioner for 
knowledge of the illegal activity, knowledge of the criminal record of a 
user of the property, or failure to take reasonable steps to prevent the 
illegal use or acquisition by another for some reason, such as a 
reasonable fear of reprisal; or
    (ii) Where the minimum standards for remission have been satisfied 
but the overall circumstances are such that, in the opinion of the 
Ruling Official, complete relief is not warranted.
    (2) The Ruling Officials may in his or her discretion grant 
mitigation to a party involved in the commission of the offense 
underlying the forfeiture where certain mitigating factors exist, 
including, but not limited to: the lack of a prior record or evidence of 
similar criminal conduct; if the violation does not include drug 
distribution, manufacturing, or importation, the fact that the violator 
has taken steps, such as drug treatment, to prevent further criminal 
conduct; the fact that the violation was minimal and was not part of a 
larger criminal scheme; the fact that the violator has cooperated with 
federal, state, or local investigations relating to the criminal conduct 
underlying the forfeiture; or the fact that complete forfeiture of an 
asset is not necessary to achieve the legitimate purposes of forfeiture.
    (3) Mitigation may take the form of a monetary condition or the 
imposition of other conditions relating to the continued use of the 
property, and the return of the property, in addition to the imposition 
of any other costs that would be chargeable as a condition to remission. 
This monetary condition is considered as an item of cost payable by the 
petitioner, and shall be deposited into the Assets Forfeiture Fund as an 
amount realized from forfeiture in accordance with the applicable 
statute. If the petitioner fails to accept the Ruling Official's 
mitigation decision or any of its conditions, or fails to pay the 
monetary amount within twenty (20) days of the receipt of the decision, 
the property shall be sold, and the monetary amount imposed and other

[[Page 236]]

costs chargeable as a condition to mitigation shall be subtracted from 
the proceeds of the sale before transmitting the remainder to the 
petitioner.


<R05>
Sec. 9.6  Special rules for specific petitioners.

    (a) General creditors. A general creditor may not be granted 
remission or mitigation of forfeiture unless he or she otherwise 
qualifies as petitioner under this part.
    (b) Rival claimants. If the beneficial owner of the forfeited 
property and the owner of a security interest in the same property each 
files a petition, and if both petitions are found to be meritorious, the 
claims of the beneficial owner shall take precedence.
    (c) Voluntary bailments. A petitioner who allows another to use his 
or her property without cost, and who is not in the business of lending 
money secured by property or of leasing or renting property for profit, 
shall be granted remission or mitigation of forfeiture in accordance 
with the provisions of Sec. 9.5.
    (d) Lessors. A person engaged in the business of leasing or renting 
real or personal property on a long-term basis with the right to 
sublease shall not be entitled to remission or mitigation of a 
forfeiture of such property unless the lessor can demonstrate compliance 
with all the requirements of Sec. 9.5.
    (e) Straw owners. A petition by any person who has acquired a 
property interest recognizable under this part, and who knew or had 
reason to believe that the interest was conveyed by the previous owner 
for the purpose of circumventing seizure, forfeiture, or the regulations 
in this part, shall be denied. A petition by a person who purchases or 
owns property for another who has a record for related crimes as defined 
in Sec. 9.2(r), or a petition by a lienholder who knows or has reason 
to believe that the purchaser or owner of record is not the real 
purchaser or owner, shall be denied unless both the purchaser of record 
and the real purchaser or owner meet the requirements of Sec. 9.5.
    (f) Judgment creditors. (1) A judgment creditor will be recognized 
as a lienholder if:
    (i) The judgment was duly recorded before the seizure of the 
property for forfeiture;
    (ii) Under applicable state or other local law, the judgment 
constitutes a valid lien on the property that attached to it before the 
seizure of the property for forfeiture; and
    (iii) The petitioner had no knowledge of the commission of any act 
or acts giving rise to the forfeiture at the time the judgment became a 
lien on the forfeited property.
    (2) A judgment creditor will not be recognized as a lienholder if 
the property in question is not property of which the judgment debtor is 
entitled to claim ownership under applicable state or other local law 
(e.g., stolen property). A judgment creditor is entitled under this part 
to no more than the amount of the judgment, exclusive of any interest, 
costs, or other fees including attorney's fees associated with the 
action that led to the judgment or its collection.
    (3) A judgment creditor's lien must be registered in the district 
where the property is located if the judgment was obtained outside the 
district.


<R05>
Sec. 9.7  Terms and conditions of remission and mitigation.

    (a) Owners. (1) An owner's interest in property that has been 
forfeited is represented by the property itself or by a monetary 
interest equivalent to that interest at the time of seizure. Whether the 
property or a monetary equivalent will be remitted to an owner shall be 
determined at the discretion of the Ruling Official.
    (2) If a civil judicial forfeiture action against the property is 
pending, release of the property must await an appropriate court order.
    (3) Where the government sells or disposes of the property prior to 
the grant of the remission, the owner shall receive the proceeds of that 
sale, less any costs incurred by the government in the sale. The Ruling 
Official, at his or her discretion, may waive the deduction of costs and 
expenses incident to the forfeiture.
    (4) Where the owner does not comply with the conditions imposed upon 
release of the property by the Ruling Official, the property shall be 
sold. Following the sale, the proceeds shall be used to pay all costs of 
the forfeiture

[[Page 237]]

and disposition of the property, in addition to any monetary conditions 
imposed. The remaining balance shall be paid to the owner.
    (b) Lienholders. (1) When the forfeited property is to be retained 
for official use or transferred to a state or local law enforcement 
agency or foreign government pursuant to law, and remission or 
mitigation has been granted to a lienholder, the recipient of the 
property shall assure that:
    (i) In the case of remission, the lien is satisfied as determined 
through the petition process; or
    (ii) In the case of mitigation, an amount equal to the net equity, 
less any monetary conditions imposed, is paid to the lienholder prior to 
the release of the property to the recipient agency of foreign 
government.
    (2) When the forfeited property is not retained for official use or 
transferred to another agency or foreign government pursuant to law, the 
lienholder shall be notified by the Ruling Official of the right to 
select either of the following alternatives:
    (i) Return of property. The lienholder may obtain possession of the 
property after paying the United States, through the Ruling Official, 
the costs and expenses incident to the forfeiture, the amount, if any, 
by which the appraised value of the property exceeds the lienholder's 
net equity in the property, and any amount specified in the Ruling 
Official's decision as a condition to remit the property. The Ruling 
Official, at his or her discretion, may waive costs and expenses 
incident to the forfeiture. The Ruling Official shall forward a copy of 
the decision, a memorandum of disposition, and the original releases to 
the United States Marshals Service or other property custodian who shall 
thereafter release the property to the lienholder; or
    (ii) Sale of property and payment to lienholder. Subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 9.9(a), upon sale of the property, the lienholder 
may receive the payment of a monetary amount up to the sum of the 
lienholder's net equity, less the expenses and costs incident to the 
forfeiture and sale of the property, and any other monetary conditions 
imposed. The Ruling Official, at his or her discretion, may waive costs 
and expenses incident to the forfeiture.
    (3) If the lienholder does not notify the Ruling Official of the 
selection of one of the two options set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section within twenty (20) days of the receipt of notification, the 
Ruling Official shall direct the United States Marshal or other property 
custodian to sell the property and pay the lienholder an amount up to 
the net equity, less the costs and expenses incurred incident to the 
forfeiture and sale, and any monetary conditions imposed. In the event a 
lienholder subsequently receives a payment of any kind on the debt owed 
for which he or she received payment as a result of the granting of 
remission or mitigation, the lienholder shall reimburse the Assets 
Forfeiture Fund to the extent of the payment received.
    (4) Where the lienholder does not comply with the conditions imposed 
upon the release of the property, the property shall be sold after 
forfeiture. From the proceeds of the sale, all costs incident to the 
forfeiture and sale shall first be deducted, and the balance up to the 
net equity, less any monetary conditions, shall be paid to the 
lienholder.


<R05>
Sec. 9.8  Provisions applicable to victims.

    The provisions of this section apply to victims of an offense 
underlying the forfeiture of property, or of a related offense, who do 
not have a present ownership interest in the forfeited property (or, in 
the case of multiple victims of an offense, who do not have a present 
ownership interest in the forfeited property that is clearly superior to 
that of other petitioner victims). The provisions of this section apply 
only with respect to property forfeited pursuant to statutes that 
explicitly authorize restoration or remission of forfeited property to 
victims. Victims who have a superior present legally cognizable 
ownership interest in forfeited property may file petitions, as other 
owners, subject to the regulations set forth in Sec. 9.7(a). The claims 
of such owner victims, like those of any other owners, shall have 
priority over the claims of any non-owner victims whose claims are 
recognized pursuant to this section.

[[Page 238]]

    (a) Qualification to file. A victim, as defined in Sec. 9.2(v), of 
an offense that was the underlying basis for the criminal, civil, or 
administrative forfeiture of specific property, or a victim of a related 
offense, may be granted remission of the forfeiture of that property, if 
in addition to complying with the other applicable provisions of Sec. 
9.8, the victim satisfactorily demonstrates that:
    (1) A pecuniary loss of a specific amount has been directly caused 
by the criminal offense, or related offense, that was the underlying 
basis for the forfeiture, and that the loss is supported by documentary 
evidence including invoices and receipts;
    (2) The pecuniary loss is the direct result of the illegal acts and 
is not the result of otherwise lawful acts that were committed in the 
course of a criminal offense;
    (3) The victim did not knowingly contribute to, participate in, 
benefit from, or act in a willfully blind manner towards the commission 
of the offense, or related offense, that was the underlying basis of the 
forfeiture;
    (4) The victim has not in fact been compensated for the wrongful 
loss of the property by the perpetrator or others; and
    (5) The victim does not have recourse reasonably available to other 
assets from which to obtain compensation for the wrongful loss of the 
property.
    (b) Pecuniary loss. The amount of the pecuniary loss suffered by a 
victim for which remission may be granted is limited to the fair market 
value of the property of which the victim was deprived as of the date of 
the occurrence of the loss. No allowance shall be made for interest 
foregone or for collateral expenses incurred to recover lost property or 
to seek other recompense.
    (c) Torts. A tort associated with illegal activity that formed the 
basis for the forfeiture shall not be a basis for remission, unless it 
constitutes the illegal activity itself, nor shall remission be granted 
for physical injuries to a petitioner or for damage to a petitioner's 
property.
    (d) Denial of petition. In the exercise of his or her discretion, 
the Ruling Official may decline to grant remission where:
    (1) There is substantial difficulty in calculating the pecuniary 
loss incurred by the victim or victims;
    (2) The amount of the remission, if granted, would be small compared 
with the amount of expenses incurred by the government in determining 
whether to grant remission; or
    (3) The total number of victims is large and the monetary amount of 
the remission so small as to make its granting impractical.
    (e) Pro rata basis. In granting remission to multiple victims 
pursuant to this section, the Ruling Official should generally grant 
remission on a pro rata basis to recognized victims when petitions 
cannot be granted in full due to the limited value of the forfeited 
property. However, the Ruling Official may consider, among others, the 
following factors in establishing appropriate priorities in individual 
cases:
    (1) The specificity and reliability of the evidence establishing a 
loss;
    (2) The fact that a particular victim is suffering an extreme 
financial hardship;
    (3) The fact that a particular victim has cooperated with the 
government in the investigation related to the forfeiture or to a 
related persecution or civil action; and
    (4) In the case of petitions filed by multiple victims of related 
offenses, the fact that a particular victim is a victim of the offense 
underlying the forfeiture.
    (f) Reimbursement. Any petitioner granted remission pursuant to this 
part shall reimburse the Assets Forfeiture Fund for the amount received 
to the extent the individual later receives compensation for the loss of 
the property from any other source. The petitioner shall surrender the 
reimbursement upon payment from any secondary source.
    (g) Claims of financial institution regulatory agencies. In cases 
involving property forfeitable under 18 U.S.C. 981(a)(1)(C) or 
(a)(1)(D), the Ruling Official may decline to grant a petition filed by 
a petitioner in whole or in part due to the lack of sufficient 
forfeitable funds to satisfy both the petition and claims of the 
financial institution regulatory agencies pursuant to 18 U.S.C.

[[Page 239]]

981(e)(3) or (7). Generally, claims of financial institution regulatory 
agencies pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 981(e)(3) or (7) shall take priority over 
claims of victims.


<R05>
Sec. 9.9  Miscellaneous provisions.

    (a) Priority of payment. Except where otherwise provided in this 
part, costs incurred by the United States Marshals Service and other 
agencies participating in the forfeiture that were incident to the 
forfeiture, sale, or other disposition of the property shall be deducted 
from the amount available for remission or mitigation. Such costs 
include, but are not limited to, court costs, storage costs, brokerage 
and other sales-related costs, the amount of any liens and associated 
costs paid by the government on the property, costs incurred in paying 
the ordinary and necessary expenses of a business seized for forfeiture, 
awards for information as authorized by statute, expenses of trustees or 
other assistants pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, 
investigative or prosecutive costs specially incurred incident to the 
particular forfeiture, and costs incurred incident to the processing of 
the petition(s) for remission or mitigation. The remaining balance shall 
be available for remission or mitigation. The Ruling Official shall 
direct the distribution of the remaining balance in the following order 
or priority, except that the Ruling Official may exercise discretion in 
determining the priority between petitioners belonging to classes 
described in paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section in exceptional 
circumstances:
    (1) Owners;
    (2) Lienholders;
    (3) Federal financial institution regulatory agencies (pursuant to 
paragraph (e) of this section), not constituting owners or lienholders; 
and
    (4) Victims not constituting owners or lienholders (pursuant to 
Sec. 9.8).
    (b) Sale or disposition of property prior to ruling. If forfeited 
property has been sold or otherwise disposed of prior to a ruling, the 
Ruling Official may grant relief in the form of a monetary amount. The 
amount realized by the sale of the property is presumed to be the value 
of the property. Monetary relief shall not be greater than the appraised 
value of the property at the time of seizure and shall not exceed the 
amount realized from the sale or other disposition. The proceeds of the 
sale shall be distributed as follows:
    (1) Payment of the government's expenses incurred incident to the 
forfeiture and sale, including court costs and storage charges, if any;
    (2) Payment to the petitioner of an amount up to his or her interest 
in the property;
    (3) Payment to the Assets Forfeiture Fund of all other costs and 
expenses incident to the forfeiture;
    (4) In the case of victims, payment of any amount up to the amount 
of his or her loss; and
    (5) Payment of the balance remaining, if any, to the Assets 
Forfeiture Fund.
    (c) Trustees and other assistants. In the exercise of his or her 
discretion, the Ruling Official, with the approval of the Asset 
Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section, may use the services of a 
trustee, other government official, or appointed contractors to notify 
potential petitioners, process petitions, and make recommendations to 
the Ruling Official on the distribution of property to petitioners. The 
expense for such assistance shall be paid out of the forfeited funds.
    (d) Other agencies of the United States. Where another agency of the 
United States is entitled to remission or mitigation of forfeited assets 
because of an interest that is recognizable under this part or is 
eligible for such transfer pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 981(e)(6), such agency 
shall request the transfer in writing, in addition to complying with any 
applicable provisions of Sec. Sec. 9.3 through 9.5. The decision to 
make such transfer shall be made in writing by the Ruling Official.
    (e) Financial institution regulatory agencies. A Ruling Official may 
direct the transfer of property under 18 U.S.C. 981(e) to certain 
federal financial institution regulatory agencies or an entity acting in 
their behalf, upon receipt of a written request, in lieu of ruling on a 
petition for remission or mitigation.
    (f) Transfers to foreign governments. A Ruling Official may decline 
to grant remission to any petitioner other than

[[Page 240]]

an owner or lienholder so that forfeited assets may be transferred to a 
foreign government pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 981(i)(1), 19 U.S.C. 
1616a(c)(2), or 21 U.S.C. 881(e)(1)(E).
    (g) Filing by attorneys. (1) A petition for remission or mitigation 
may be filed by a petitioner or by his or her attorney or legal 
guardian. If an attorney files on behalf of the petitioner, the petition 
must include a signed and sworn statement by the client-petitioner 
stating that:
    (i) The attorney has the authority to represent the petitioner in 
this proceeding;
    (ii) The petitioner has fully reviewed the petition; and
    (iii) The petition is truthful and accurate in every respect.
    (2) Verbal notification of representation is not acceptable. 
Responses and notification of rulings shall not be sent to an attorney 
claiming to represent a petitioner unless a written notice of 
representation is filed. No extensions of time shall be granted due to 
delays in submission of the notice of representation.
    (h) Consolidated petitions. At the discretion of the Ruling Official 
in individual cases, a petition may be filed by one petitioner on behalf 
of other petitioners, provided the petitions are based on similar 
underlying facts, and the petitioner who files the petition has written 
authority to do so on behalf of the other petitioners. This authority 
must be either expressed in documents giving the petitioner the 
authority to file petitions for remission, or reasonably implied from 
documents giving the petitioner express authority to file claims or 
lawsuits related to the course of conduct in question on behalf of these 
petitioners. An insurer or an administrator of an employee benefit plan, 
for example, which itself has standing to file a petition as a 
``victim'' within the meaning of Sec. 9.2(v), may also file a petition 
on behalf of its insured or plan beneficiaries for any claims they may 
have based on co-payments made to the perpetrator of the offense 
underlying the forfeiture or the perpetrator of a ``related offense'' 
within the meaning of Sec. 9.2(s), if the authority to file claims or 
lawsuits is contained in the document or documents establishing the 
plan. Where such a petition is filed, any amounts granted as a remission 
must be transferred to the other petitioners, not the party filing the 
petition; although, in his or her discretion, the Ruling Official may 
use the actual petitioner as an intermediary for transferring the 
amounts authorized as a remission to the other petitioners.

       Subpart A_Retention of Private Counsel for Debt Collection


<R05>
Sec. 11.1  Delegation of authority.

    The Assistant Attorney General for Administration shall exercise the 
full authority of the Attorney General to develop and administer the 
Department of Justice pilot program for debt collection by private 
counsel. This authority shall include, but is not limited to, the 
authority to set policies and procedures for the program, and to enter 
into contracts for the retention of private counsel. The Assistant 
Attorney General for Adminstration can in turn delegate authority 
regarding debt collection to subordinate officials as appropriate. 
Existing delegations of authority with respect to settlement 
determinations on disputed claims shall remain in force. See generally, 
28 CFR 0.160 et seq.


<R05>
Sec. 11.2  Pilot program.

    The Assistant Attorney General for Administration, in consultation 
with the Executive Office for United States Attorneys, shall designate 
the districts that will participate in the pilot program. U.S. Attorneys 
in the districts chosen for the pilot program, shall direct the full 
cooperation and assistance of their respective offices in implementing 
the program. Among other things, the U.S. Attorneys shall designate an 
Assistant U.S. Attorney to serve as the Contracting Officer's Technical 
Representative (COTR) on the contracts with private debt collection 
lawyers in their respective districts. The COTRs will be responsible for 
assisting the contracting officer by supervising the work of the private 
counsel in their respective districts and providing necessary approvals 
with respect to the initiation or settlement of lawsuits or similar 
matters.


<R05>
Sec. 11.3  Compliance with existing laws.

    The procurement of the services of private attorneys for debt 
collection shall be accomplished in accordance with the competitive 
procurement procedures mandated by Federal law, and set forth in the 
Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, 41 U.S.C. 251 
et seq. Best efforts shall be made to encourage extensive participation 
by law firms owned and controlled by socially and economically 
disadvantaged individuals in the competition for award of these 
contracts in the pilot districts. Such efforts shall include, at 
minimum, publication of the

[[Page 243]]

requirement for these services in the Commerce Business Daily and in a 
selection of pertinent legal publications likely to reach socially and 
economically disadvantaged firms, as well as sending written notice of 
the requirements to bar associations that have a significant socially 
and economically disadvantaged membership in the pilot districts. These 
special recruitment efforts will not authorize or permit preferential 
consideration to any bidders in selection for award of these contracts. 
The Department's Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization 
shall also make its resources available to assist in encouraging broad 
participation in this competition.

otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 11.4  Purpose and scope.

    (a) Purpose. The purpose of this subpart is to implement 5 U.S.C. 
5514 and 31 U.S.C. 3716, which authorize the collection by salary or 
administrative offset of debts owed by persons, organizations, or 
entities to the federal government. Generally, however, a debt may not 
be collected by such means if it has been outstanding for more than ten 
years after the agency's right to collect the debt first accrued. This 
subpart is consistent with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) 
regulations on salary offset, codified at 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, and 
with regulations on administrative offset published jointly by the 
General Accounting Office (GAO) and the Department of Justice 
(Department), codified at 4 CFR part 102.
    (b) Scope. (1) This subpart establishes Departmental procedures for 
the collection of certain debts owed the government.
    (2) This subpart applies to collections by the Department from:
    (i) Federal employees who are indebted to the Department;
    (ii) Employees of the Department who are indebted to other agencies; 
and
    (iii) Other persons, organizations, or entities that are indebted to 
the Department.
    (3) This subpart does not apply:
    (i) To debts or claims arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986 (26 U.S.C. et seq.), the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 et 
seq.), or the tariff laws of the United States;
    (ii) To a situation to which the Contract Disputes Act (41 U.S.C. 
601 et seq.) applies; or
    (iii) In any case where collection of a debt is explicitly provided 
for or prohibited by another statute (e.g., travel advances in 5 U.S.C. 
5705 and employee training expenses in 5 U.S.C. 4108).
    (4) Nothing in this subpart precludes the compromise, suspension, or 
termination of collection actions where appropriate under the standards 
implementing the Federal Claims Collection Act (31 U.S.C. 3711 et seq.), 
namely, 4 CFR chapter II and 38 CFR 1.900-1.954).
    (5) This subpart does not govern debt collection procedures 
implemented by other agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 11.5  Delegation of authority.

    Authority to conduct the following activities is hereby delegated to 
heads of Department organizations with respect to debts arising in their 
respective organizations:
    (a) Initiate and effectuate the administrative collection process.
    (b) Accept or reject compromise offers and suspend or terminate 
collection actions where the claim does not exceed $100,000 or such 
higher amount as the Attorney General may from time to time prescribe, 
exclusive of interest, administrative costs, and penalties as provided 
herein, as set forth in 311 U.S.C. 3711(a)(2).
    (c) Report to consumer reporting agencies certain data pertaining to 
delinquent debts.
    (d) Use offset procedures to effectuate collection.
    (e) Take any other action necessary to facilitate and augment 
collection in accordance with the policies contained herein and as 
otherwise provided by law.

<R05>
Sec. 11.7  Salary adjustments.

    Any negative adjustment to pay arising out of an employee's election 
of coverage, or a change in coverage, under a Federal benefits program 
requiring periodic deductions from pay shall not be considered 
collection of a ``debt'' for the purposes of this subpart if the amount 
to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less. In such

<R05>
Sec. 11.8  Salary offset.

    (a) Notice requirements before offset. Deductions under the 
authority of 5 U.S.C. 5514 will not be made unless the creditor agency 
provides the employee with a written Notice of Intent to Offset a 
minimum of 30 calendar days before salary offset is initiated. When the 
Department is the creditor agency, this Notice of Intent shall be hand-
delivered or sent by certified mail to the Assistant Director, Justice 
Employee Data Service, or to the Section Chief, Voucher and Payroll 
Section, Administrative Services Division, FBI, who shall then transmit 
the Notice of Intent to the debtor-employee. The Notice of Intent shall

the claim and has determined that a debt is owed, including the amount 
of the debt and the facts giving rise to the debt;
    (2) The organization head's intention to collect the debt by means 
of deduction from the employee's current disposable pay account until 
the debt and all accumulated interest is paid in full;
    (3) A repayment schedule that includes the amount, frequency, 
proposed beginning date, and duration of the intended deductions;
    (4) The opportunity for the employee to propose an alternative 
written schedule for the voluntary repayment of the debt, in lieu of 
offset, on terms acceptable to the Department. The employee shall 
include a justification in the request for the alternative schedule. The

not under the supervision or control of the Attorney General) with 
respect to the existence and amount of the debt claimed or the repayment 
schedule (i.e., the percentage of disposable pay to be deducted each pay 
period), so long as a petition is filed by the employee as prescribed in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (9) The name, address, and telephone number of the officer or 
employee of the Department to whom a proposal for voluntary repayment 
must be sent; and the name, address, and telephone number of an officer 
or employee of the Department who may be contacted concerning procedures

stay the commencement of collection proceedings;
    (12) The name and address of the office to which the petition should 
be sent;
    (13) That the Department will initiate certification procedures to 
implement a salary offset not less than 30 days from the date of receipt 
of the Notice of Intent to Offset, unless the employee files a timely 
petition for a hearing;
    (14) That a final decision on whether a hearing will be held (if one 
is requested) will be issued at the earliest practical date, but not 
later than 60 days after the filing of the petition requesting the 
hearing;
    (15) That any knowingly false or frivolous statements, 
representations, or evidence may subject the employee to:
    (i) Disciplinary procedures appropriate under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, 5 
CFR part 752, or any other applicable statutes or regulations;
    (ii) Penalties under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729-3731, or 
under any other applicable statutory authority; or
    (iii) Criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 1001, and 1002 or 
under any other applicable statutory authority;
    (16) Any other rights and remedies available to the employee under 
statutes or regulations governing the program for which the collection 
is being made;
    (17) That unless there are applicable contractual or statutory 
provisions to the contrary, amounts paid on or deducted from debts that 
are later waived or found not to be owed to the United States will be 
promptly refunded to the employee, and
    (i) Interest shall be paid on any amount paid on or deducted from a 
debt that is found not to be owed to the United States; and
    (ii) Interest shall not be paid on any amount paid on or deducted 
from a debt that is later waived; and
    (18) That proceedings with respect to such debt are governed by 5 
U.S.C. 5514.
    (b) Review of Departmental records related to the debt. (1) An 
employee who desires to inspect or copy Department records related to 
the debt must send a letter to the official designated in the Notice of 
Intent requesting access to the relevant records. The letter must be 
received in the office of the salary offset coordination official within 
15 days after the employee's receipt of the Notice of Intent.
    (2) In response to a timely request submitted by the debtor, the 
designated salary offset coordination official will notify the employee 
of the location and time when the employee may inspect and copy records 
related to the debt.

[[Page 247]]

    (3) If the employee is unable personally to inspect the records, due 
to geographical or other constraints, the salary offset coordination 
official shall arrange to send copies of such records to the employee.
    (c) Opportunity for a hearing where the Department is the creditor 
agency--(1) Request for a hearing. (i) An employee who requests a 
hearing on the existence or amount of the debt held by the Department or 
on the offset schedule proposed by the Department must send such request 
to the office designated in the Notice of Intent. The request or 
petition for a hearing must be received by the designated office on or 
before the 15th calendar day following receipt by the employer of the 
notice.
    (ii) The employee must specify whether an oral hearing is requested. 
If an oral hearing is desired, the request should explain why the matter 
cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence alone. The 
request must be signed by the employee and must fully identify and 
explain with reasonable specificity all the facts, evidence, and 
witnesses, if any, that the employee believes support his or her 
position.
    (2) Failure to timely submit. If the employee files a request or 
petition for hearing after the expiration of the 15-calendar-day period 
provided for in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the organization head 
may accept the request if the employee can show that the delay was the 
result of circumstances beyond his or her control or that he or she 
failed to receive actual notice of the filing deadline.
    (3) Obtaining the services of hearing official. (i) When the debtor 
is not a Department employee and the Department cannot provide a prompt 
and appropriate hearing before an administrative law judge or other 
hearing official, the Department may request a hearing official from an 
agent of the paying agency, as designated in 5 CFR part 581, appendix A, 
or as otherwise designated by the paying agency.
    (ii) When the debtor is a Department employee, the Department may 
contact any agent of another agency, as designated in 5 CFR part 581, 
appendix A, or as otherwise designated by the agency, to request a 
hearing official.
    (4) Procedure--(i) Notice. After the employee requests a hearing, 
the hearing official shall notify the employee of the form of the 
hearing to be provided. If the hearing will be oral, the notice shall 
set forth the date, time, and location of the hearing, which must occur 
no more than 30 days after the request is received. If the hearing will 
be conducted by examination of documents, the employee shall be notified 
within 30 days that he or she should submit evidence and arguments in 
writing to the hearing official.
    (ii) Oral hearing. An employee who requests an oral hearing shall be 
provided an oral hearing if the hearing official determines that the 
matter cannot be resolved by review of documentary evidence alone (e.g., 
when an issue of credibility or veracity is involved). The hearing need 
not be an adversarial adjudication, and rules of evidence need not 
apply. Oral hearings may take the form of, but are not limited to:
    (A) Informal conferences with the hearing official in which the 
employee and agency representative are given full opportunity to present 
evidence, witnesses, and argument;
    (B) Informal meetings in which the hearing examiner interviews the 
employee; or
    (C) Formal written submissions followed by an opportunity for oral 
presentation.

Witnesses who testify in oral hearings shall do so under oath or 
affirmation.
    (iii) Documentary hearing. If the hearing official determines that 
an oral hearing is not necessary, he or she shall make the determination 
based upon a review of the written record.
    (iv) Record. The hearing official shall maintain a summary record of 
any hearing conducted under this section.
    (5) Date of decision. The hearing official shall issue a written 
opinion stating his or her decision, based upon all evidence and 
information developed at the hearing, as soon as practicable after the 
hearing, but not later than 60 days after the date on which the petition 
was received by the Department, unless the hearing was delayed at the 
request of the employee, in which case the 60 day decision period shall 
be extended by the number of days by which the hearing was postponed. 
Decisions

[[Page 248]]

not timely rendered shall result in the waiver of penalty and interest 
costs. The decision of the hearing official shall be final.
    (6) Content of decision. The written decision shall include:
    (i) A summary of the facts concerning the origin, nature, and amount 
of the debt;
    (ii) The hearing official's findings, analysis, and conclusions; and
    (iii) The terms of any repayment schedules, if applicable.
    (7) Failure to appear. If, in the absence of good cause shown (e.g., 
illness), the employee or the representative of the Department fails to 
appear, the hearing official shall proceed with the hearing as 
scheduled, and make his or her determination based upon the oral 
testimony presented and the documentation submitted by both parties. At 
the request of both parties, the hearing official may schedule a new 
hearing date. Both parties shall be given reasonable notice of the time 
and place of this new hearing.
    (d) Certification where the Department is the creditor agency. (1) 
The salary offset coordination officer shall provide a certification to 
the appropriate payroll office in all cases where:
    (i) The hearing official determines that a debt exists; or
    (ii) The employee admits the existence and amount of the debt by 
failing to request a hearing.
    (2) The certification must be in writing and must state:
    (i) That the employee owes the debt;
    (ii) The amount and basis of the debt;
    (iii) The date the government's right to collect the debt first 
accrued;
    (iv) That the Department's regulations have been approved by OPM 
pursuant to 5 CFR part 550, subpart K;
    (v) If the collection is to be made by lump-sum payment, the amount 
and data such payment will be collected;
    (vi) If the collection is to be made in installments, the number of 
installments to be collected, the amount of each installment, and the 
commencing date of the first installment, if a date other than the next 
officially established pay period; and
    (vii) The date the employee was notified of the debt, the action(s) 
taken under 5 U.S.C. 5514(a), and the dates such actions were taken.
    (e) Voluntary repayment agreements as alternative to salary offset 
where the Department is the creditor agency. (1) In response to a Notice 
of Intent, an employee may propose to repay the debt in accordance with 
scheduled installment payments. Any employee who wishes to repay a debt 
without salary offset shall submit in writing a proposed agreement to 
repay the debt. The proposal shall set forth a proposed repayment 
schedule. Any proposal under this subsection must be received by the 
office of the official designated in the notice within 15 calendar days 
after receipt of the Notice of Intent.
    (2) In response to a timely proposal by the debtor, the organization 
head shall notify the employee whether the employee's proposed written 
agreement for repayment is acceptable. It is within the organization 
head's discretion to accept or reject a repayment agreement.
    (3) If the organization head decides that the proposed repayment 
agreement is unacceptable, the employee shall have 15 days from the date 
he or she received notice of the decision in which to file a petition 
for a hearing.
    (4) If the organization head decides that the proposed repayment 
agreement is acceptable, the arrangement shall be put in writing and 
signed by both the employee and the organization head.
    (f) Special review where the Department is the creditor agency. (1) 
An employee subject to salary offset or a voluntary repayment agreement 
may, at any time, request a special review by the Department of the 
amount of the salary offset or voluntary payment, based on materially 
changed circumstances, including but not limited to catastrophic 
illness, divorce, death, or disability.
    (2) In determining whether, as a result of materially changed 
circumstances, an offset would prevent the employee from meeting 
essential subsistence expenses (costs incurred for food, housing, 
clothing, transportation, and medical care), the employee shall submit a 
detailed statement and supporting documents for the employee,

[[Page 249]]

his or her spouse, and dependents indicating:
    (i) Income for all sources;
    (ii) Assets;
    (iii) Liabilities;
    (iv) Number of dependents;
    (v) Expenses for food, housing, clothing, and transportation;
    (vi) Medical expenses; and
    (vii) Exceptional expenses, if any.
    (3) If the employee requests a special review under this paragraph, 
the employee shall file an alternative proposed offset or payment 
schedule and a statement, with supporting documents, showing why the 
current salary offset or payments result in an extreme financial 
hardship to the employee.
    (4) The organization head shall evaluate the statement and 
supporting documents and determine whether the original offset or 
repayment schedule imposes an extreme financial hardship on the 
employee. The organization head shall notify the employee in writing 
within 30 days of such determination, including, if appropriate, his or 
her acceptance of a revised offset or payment schedule.
    (5) If the special review results in a revised offset or repayment 
schedule, the salary offset coordination officer shall provide a new 
certification to the paying agency.
    (g) Notice of salary offset where the Department is the paying 
agency. (1) Upon receipt of proper certification from the creditor 
agency, the applicable payroll office shall send the employee a written 
notice of salary offset. Such notice shall advise the employee that:
    (i) The certification has been received from the creditor agency; 
and
    (ii) Salary offset will be initiated at the next officially 
established pay interval.
    (2) The applicable payroll office shall provide a copy of the notice 
to the creditor agency and advise such agency of the dollar amount to be 
offset and the pay period when the offset will begin.
    (h) Procedures for salary offset where the Department is the paying 
agency--(1) Generally. (i) The salary offset coordination officer shall 
coordinate salary deductions under this section.
    (ii) The applicable payroll office shall determine the amount of an 
employee's disposable pay and offset salary.
    (iii) Deductions shall begin the pay period following receipt by the 
applicable payroll office of the certification or as soon thereafter as 
possible.
    (2) Types of collection--(i) Lump-sum payment. If the amount of the 
debt is equal to or less than 15 percent of the employee's disposable 
pay, such debt ordinarily will be collected in one lump-sum payment.
    (ii) Installment deductions. Installment deductions will be made 
over a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment. The 
size and frequency of installment deductions will bear a reasonable 
relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. 
However, the amount deducted from any period will not exceed 15 percent 
of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made unless the 
employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. The 
installment payment should normally be sufficient in size and frequency 
to liquidate the debt in no more than three years. Installment payments 
of less than $50 should be accepted only in the most unusual 
circumstances.
    (iii) Lump-sum deductions from final check. A lump-sum deduction 
exceeding 15 percent of disposable pay may be made pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 
3716 from any final salary payment due a former employee in order to 
liquidate a debt, whether the former employee was separated voluntarily 
or involuntarily.
    (iv) Lump-sum deductions from other sources. Whenever an employee 
subject to salary offset is separated from the Department, and the 
balance of the debt cannot be liquidated by offset of the final salary 
check, the Department, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716, may offset any later 
payments of any kind against the balance of the debt.
    (3) Multiple debts. Where two or more creditor agencies are seeking 
salary offset, or where two or more debts are owed to a single creditor 
agency, the applicable payroll office may, at its discretion, determine 
whether one or

[[Page 250]]

more debts should be offset simultaneously within the 15 percent 
limitation. The best interests of the government shall be the primary 
consideration in the determination by the payroll office of the order of 
the debt collection.
    (4) Precedence of salary deductions by the Department. (i) For 
Department employees, debts owed shall be paid out of disposable pay in 
the following order of precedence:
    (A) Indebtedness due the Department.
    (B) Indebtedness due other agencies.
    (C) Garnishments for alimony and child support payments.
    (D) Court-ordered bankruptcy payments under the Bankruptcy Code.
    (E) Optional life insurance premiums.
    (F) Other voluntary deductions including allotments and assignments, 
in the order determined by the paying agency.
    (ii) In the event that a debt to the Department is certified while 
an employee is subject to salary offset to repay another agency, the 
applicable payroll office may decide whether the debt to the other 
agency should be repaid in full before collecting the Department's claim 
or whether changes should be made in the salary deduction being sent to 
the other agency. If debts owed to the Department can be collected in 
one pay period, the payroll office may suspend the salary offset to the 
other agency for that pay period in order to liquidate the Department's 
debt.
    (i) Coordinating salary offset with other agencies--(1) 
Responsibility of the Department as the creditor agency. (i) The salary 
offset coordination officer shall be responsible for:
    (A) Arranging for hearing upon proper petition by a federal 
employee;
    (B) Preparing the Notice of Intent to Offset consistent with the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section;
    (C) Obtaining hearing officials from other agencies pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and
    (D) Ensuring that each certification of debt is sent to a paying 
agency pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (ii) Upon completion of the procedures established in paragraphs (a) 
through (f) of this section, the salary offset coordination officer 
shall submit a debt claim and an installment agreement or other 
instruction on the payment schedule, if applicable, to the employee's 
paying agency.
    (iii) If the employee is in the process of separating from 
government employment, the Department shall submit its debt claim to the 
employee's paying agency for collection by lump-sum deductions from the 
employee's final check. The paying agency shall certify the total amount 
of its collection and furnish a copy of the certification to the 
Department and to the employee.
    (iv) If the employee is already separated and all payments due from 
his or her former paying agency have been paid, the Department may, 
unless otherwise prohibited, request that money due and payable to the 
employee from the federal government be administratively offset to 
collect the debt.
    (v) When an employee transfers to another paying agency, the 
Department shall not repeat the procedures described in paragraphs (a) 
through (f) of this section in order to resume collecting the debt. 
Instead, the Department shall review the debt upon receiving the former 
paying agency's notice of the employee's transfer and shall ensure the 
collection is resumed by the new paying agency.
    (2) Responsibility of the Department as the paying agency--(i) 
Complete claim. When the Department receives a certified claim from a 
creditor agency, the employee shall be given written notice of the 
certification, the date salary offset will begin, and the amount of the 
periodic deductions. Deductions shall be scheduled to begin at the next 
officially established pay interval or as soon thereafter as possible.
    (ii) Incomplete claim. When the Department receives an incomplete 
certification of debt from a creditor agency, the Department shall 
return the debt claim with notice that procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 
and 5 CFR 550.1104 must be followed and that a properly certified debt 
claim must be received before action will be taken to collect from the 
employee's current pay account.

[[Page 251]]

    (iii) Review. The Department is not authorized to review the merits 
of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or 
validity of the debt certified by the creditor agency.
    (iv) Employees who transfer from one paying agency to another. If, 
after the creditor agency has submitted the debt claim to the 
Department, the employee transfers to an agency outside the Department 
before the debt is collected in full, the Department must certify the 
total amount collected on the debt. One copy of the certification shall 
be furnished to the employee and one copy shall be sent to the creditor 
agency along with notice of the employee's transfer.
    (j) Interest, penalties, and administrative costs. Where the 
Department is the creditor agency, it shall assess interest, penalties, 
and administrative costs pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717 and 4 CFR 102.13.
    (k) Refunds. (1) Where the Department is the creditor agency, it 
shall promptly refund any amount deducted under the authority of 5 
U.S.C. 5514 when:
    (i) The debt is compromised or otherwise found not to be owing to 
the United States; or
    (ii) An administrative or judicial order directs the Department to 
make a refund.
    (2) Unless required by law or contract, refunds under this paragraph 
(k) shall not bear interest.
    (l) Request from a creditor agency for the services of a hearing 
official. (1) The Department may provide a hearing official upon request 
of the creditor agency when the debtor is employed by the Department and 
the creditor agency cannot provide a prompt and appropriate hearing 
before a hearing official furnished pursuant to another lawful 
arrangement.
    (2) The Department may provide a hearing official upon request of a 
creditor agency when the debtor works for the creditor agency and that 
agency cannot arrange for a hearing official.
    (3) The salary offset coordination officer shall arrange for 
qualified personnel to serve as hearing officials.
    (4) Services rendered under this paragraph (l) shall be provided on 
a fully reimbursable basis pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 1535.
    (m) Non-waiver of rights by payments. A debtor's payment, whether 
voluntary or involuntary, of all or any portion of a debt being 
collected pursuant to this section shall not be construed as a waiver of 
any rights that the debtor may have under any statute, regulation, or 
contract except as otherwise provided by law or contract.


<R05>
Sec. 11.9  Administrative offset.

    (a) Collection. The organization head may collect a claim pursuant 
to 31 U.S.C. 3716 from a person, organization, or entity other than an 
agency of the United States Government by administrative offset of 
monies other than salaries payable by the government. Collection by 
administrative offset shall be undertaken where the claim is certain in 
amount, where offset is feasible and desirable and not otherwise 
prohibited, where the applicable statute of limitations has not expired, 
and where the offset is in the best interest of the United States.
    (b) Withholding of payment. Prior to the completion of the 
procedures described in paragraph (c) of this section, the Department 
may withhold a payment to be made to a debtor, if:
    (1) Failure to withhold payment would substantially prejudice the 
Department's ability to collect the debt; and
    (2) The time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably 
permit completion of the procedures described in paragraph (c) of this 
section. Such prior withholding shall be followed promptly by the 
completion of the procedures described in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Debtor's rights. Unless the procedures described in paragraph 
(b) of this section are used, prior to collecting any claim by 
administrative offset, the organization head shall provide the debtor 
with the following:
    (1) Written notification of the nature and amount of the claim, the 
intention of the organization head to collect the claim through 
administrative offset, and a statement of the rights of the debtor under 
this paragraph;

[[Page 252]]

    (2) An opportunity to inspect and copy the records of the Department 
with respect to the claim;
    (3) An opportunity to have the Department's determination of 
indebtedness reviewed by the organization head. Any request for review 
by the debtor shall be in writing and be submitted to the Department 
within 30 days of the date of the notice of the offset. The organization 
head may waive the time limit for requesting review for good cause shown 
by the debtor; and
    (4) An opportunity to enter into a written agreement for the 
repayment of the amount of the claim at the discretion of the 
Department.

If the procedures described in paragraph (b) of this section are 
employed, the procedures described in this paragraph shall be effected 
after offset.
    (d) Interest. The Department is authorized to assess interest and 
related charges on debts that are not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717 to the 
extent authorized under the common law or other applicable statutory 
authority.

   Subpart C_IRS Tax Refund Offset Provisions for Collection of Debts

    Source: Order No. 1792-93, 58 FR 51223, Oct. 1, 1993, unless 
otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 11.10  Scope.

    The provisions of 26 U.S.C. 6402(d) and 31 U.S.C. 3720A authorize 
the Secretary of the Treasury, acting through the Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS), to offset a delinquent debt owed to the United States 
Government from the tax refund due a taxpayer when other collection 
efforts have failed to recover the amount due. The purpose of these 
statutes is to improve the ability of the Government to collect money 
owed it while granting the debtor notice and certain other protections. 
This subpart authorizes the collection of debts owed to the United 
States Government by persons, organizations, and entities by means of 
offsetting any tax refunds due to the debtor by the IRS. It allows 
referral to the IRS for collection of debts that are past due and 
legally enforceable but not reduced to judgment and debts that have been 
reduced to judgment.


<R05>
Sec. 11.11  Definitions.

    (a) Debt. Debt means money owed by an individual, organization or 
entity from sources which include loans insured or guaranteed by the 
United States and all other amounts due the United States from fees, 
leases, services, overpayments, civil and criminal penalties, damages, 
interest, fines, administrative costs, and all other similar sources. A 
debt becomes eligible for tax refund offset procedures if it cannot 
currently be collected pursuant to the salary offset procedures of 5 
U.S.C. 5514(a)(1) and is ineligible for administrative offset under 31 
U.S.C. 3716(a) by reason of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(2), or cannot currently be 
collected by administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) against 
amounts payable to the debtor by the Department of Justice. A non-
judgment debt is eligible for tax refund offset procedures if the 
Department's or the referring agency's right of action accrued more than 
three months but less than ten years before the offset is made. Judgment 
debts are eligible for referral at any time. Debts that have been 
referred to the Department of Justice by other agencies for collection 
are included in this definition.
    (b) Past due. All accelerated debts and all judgment debts are past 
due for purposes of this section. Such debts remain past due until paid 
in full. An accelerated debt is past due if, at the time of the notice 
required by Sec. 11.12(b), any part of the debt had been due, but not 
paid, for at least 90 days. Such an unaccelerated debt remains past due 
until paid to the current amount of indebtedness.
    (c) Notice. Notice means the information sent to the debtor pursuant 
to Sec. 11.12(b). The date of the notice is the date shown on the 
notice letter as its date of issuance.
    (d) Dispute. A dispute is a written statement supported by 
documentation or other evidence that all or part of an alleged debt is 
not past due or legally enforceable, that the amount is not the amount 
currently owed, that the outstanding debt has been satisfied, or, in the 
case of a debt reduced to judgment, that the judgment has been satisfied 
or stayed.

[[Page 253]]


<R05>
Sec. 11.12  Procedures.

    (a) The Department may refer any past due, legally enforceable non-
judgment debt of an individual, organization or entity to the IRS for 
offset if the Department's or the referring agency's rights of action 
accrued more than three months but less than ten years before the offset 
is made. Debts reduced to judgment may be referred at any time. Debts in 
amounts lower than $25.00 are not subject to referral.
    (b) The Department will provide the debtor with written notice of 
its intent to offset before initiating the offset. Notice will be mailed 
to the debtor at the current address of the debtor, as determined from 
information obtained from the IRS pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6103(m)(2), (4), 
(5) or from information regarding the debt maintained by the Department 
of Justice. The notice sent to the debtor will state the amount of the 
debt and inform the debtor that:
    (1) The debt is past due;
    (2) The Department intends to refer the debt to the IRS for offset 
from tax refunds that may be due to the taxpayer;
    (3) The Department intends to provide information concerning the 
delinquent debt exceeding $100 to a consumer reporting bureau (credit 
bureau) unless such debt has already been disclosed; and
    (4) The debtor has 65 days from the date of notice in which to 
present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past due, that the 
amount is not the amount currently owed, that the outstanding debt has 
been satisfied, or, if a judgment debt, that the debt has been 
satisfied, or stayed, before the debt is reported to a consumer 
reporting agency, if applicable, and referred to the IRS for offset from 
tax refunds.
    (c) If the debtor neither pays the amount due nor presents evidence 
that the amount is not past due or is satisfied or stayed, the 
Department will report the debt to a consumer reporting agency at the 
end of the notice period, if applicable, and refer the debt to the IRS 
for offset from the taxpayer's federal tax refund.
    (d) A debtor may request a review by the Department if the debtor 
believes that all or part of the debt is not past due or is not legally 
enforceable, or, in the case of a judgment debt, that the debt has been 
stayed or the amount satisfied, as follows:
    (1) The debtor must send a written request for review to the address 
provided in the notice.
    (2) The request must state the amount disputed and the reasons why 
the debtor believes that the debt is not past due, is not legally 
enforceable, has been satisfied, or, if a judgment debt, has been 
satisfied or stayed.
    (3) The request must include any documents that the debtor wishes to 
be considered or state that additional information will be submitted 
within the time permitted.
    (4) If the debtor wishes to inspect records establishing the nature 
and amount of the debt, the debtor must request an opportunity for such 
an inspection in writing. The office holding the relevant records shall 
make them available for inspection during normal business hours.
    (5) The request for review and any additional information submitted 
pursuant to the request must be received by the Department at the 
address stated in the notice within 65 days of the date of issuance of 
the notice.
    (6) The Department will review disputes and shall consider its 
records and any documentation and arguments submitted by the debtor. The 
Department's decision to refer to the IRS any disputed portion of the 
debt shall be made by the Assistant Attorney General for Administration 
of his designee, who shall hold a position at least one supervisory 
level above the person who made the decision to offset the debt. The 
Department shall send a written notice of its decision to the debtor. 
There is no administrative appeal of this decision.
    (7) If the evidence presented by the debtor is considered by a non-
Departmental agent or other entities or persons acting on the 
Department's behalf, the debtor will be accorded at least 30 days from 
the date the agent or other entity or person determines that all or part 
of the debt is past-due and legally enforceable to request review by an 
officer or employee of the Department of any unresolved dispute.
    (8) Any debt that previously has been reviewed pursuant to this 
section or

[[Page 254]]

any other section of this part, or that has been reduced to a judgment, 
may not be disputed except on the grounds of payments made or events 
occurring subsequent to the previous review of judgment.
    (e) The Department will notify the IRS of any change in the amount 
due promptly after receipt of payments or notice of other reductions.
    (f) In the event that more than one debt is owed, the IRS refund 
offset procedure will be applied in the order in which the debts became 
past due.

$50,000;
    (d) Jointly determine (along with the Secretary of State and the

interest and whether that alien and members of his immediate family may 
receive immigrant visas and be admitted to the United States for 
permanent residence, notwithstanding the requirements of the Immigration 
and Nationality Act;
    (e) Notify any person claiming an award of the determination 
regarding the claim and the amount of the reward, if any. If no reward 
is determined

to be justified, state the reasons, consistent with national security, 
for the denial;
    (f) Certify and transmit, along with the approval of the President 
if necessary, any award to be made to the Director of Central 
Intelligence for payment out of funds appropriated or available for the 
administration of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended, 50 
U.S.C. 401 et seq;
    (g) Not certify any amount over $500,000.

<R05>
Sec. 14.1  Scope of regulations.

    These regulations shall apply only to claims asserted under the 
Federal Tort Claims Act. The terms Federal agency and agency, as used in 
this part, include the executive departments, the military departments, 
independent establishments of the United States, and corporations 
primarily acting as instrumentalities or agencies of the United States 
but do not include any contractor with the United States.

[Order No. 960-81, 46 FR 52355, Oct. 27, 1981]


<R05>
Sec. 14.2  Administrative claim; when presented.

    (a) For purposes of the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 2401(b), 2672, and 
2675, a claim shall be deemed to have been presented when a Federal 
agency receives from a claimant, his duly authorized agent or legal 
representative, an executed Standard Form 95 or other written 
notification of an incident, accompanied by a claim for money damages in 
a sum certain for injury to or loss of property, personal injury, or 
death alleged to have occurred by reason of the incident; and the title 
or legal capacity of the person signing, and is accompanied by evidence 
of his authority to present a claim on behalf of the claimant as agent, 
executor, administrator, parent, guardian, or other representative.
    (b)(1) A claim shall be presented to the Federal agency whose 
activities gave rise to the claim. When a claim is presented to any 
other Federal agency, that agency shall transfer it forthwith to the 
appropriate agency, if the proper agency can be identified from the 
claim, and advise the claimant of the transfer. If transfer is not 
feasible the claim shall be returned to the claimant. The fact of 
transfer shall not, in itself, preclude further transfer, return of the 
claim to the claimant or other appropriate disposition of the claim. A 
claim shall be presented as required by 28 U.S.C. 2401(b) as of the date 
it is received by the appropriate agency.
    (2) When more than one Federal agency is or may be involved in the 
events giving rise to the claim, an agency with which the claim is filed 
shall contact all other affected agencies in order to designate the 
single agency which will thereafter investigate and decide the merits of 
the claim. In the event that an agreed upon designation cannot be made 
by the affected agencies, the Department of Justice shall be consulted 
and will thereafter designate an agency to investigate and decide the 
merits of the claim. Once a determination has been made, the designated 
agency shall notify the claimant that all future correspondence 
concerning the claim shall be directed to that Federal agency. All 
involved Federal agencies may agree either to conduct their own 
administrative reviews and to coordinate the results or to have the 
investigations conducted by the designated Federal agency, but, in 
either event, the designated Federal agency will be responsible for the 
final determination of the claim.
    (3) A claimant presenting a claim arising from an incident to more 
than one agency should identify each agency to which the claim is 
submitted at the time each claim is presented. Where a claim arising 
from an incident is presented to more than one Federal agency without 
any indication that more than one agency is involved, and any one of the 
concerned Federal agencies takes final action on that claim, the final 
action thus taken is conclusive on the claims presented to the other 
agencies in regard to the time required for filing suit set forth in 28 
U.S.C. 2401(b). However, if a second involved Federal agency 
subsequently desires to take further action with a view towards settling 
the claim the second Federal agency may treat the matter as a request 
for reconsideration of the final denial under 28 CFR 14.9(b), unless 
suit has been filed in the interim, and so advise the claimant.
    (4) If, after an agency final denial, the claimant files a claim 
arising out of the same incident with a different Federal agency, the 
new submission of the claim will not toll the requirement of 28 U.S.C. 
2401(b) that suit must be filed within six months of the final denial by 
the first agency, unless the second agency specifically and explicitly 
treats the second submission as a request for reconsideration under 28 
CFR 14.9(b) and so advises the claimant.

[[Page 260]]

    (c) A claim presented in compliance with paragraph (a) of this 
section may be amended by the claimant at any time prior to final agency 
action or prior to the exercise of the claimant's option under 28 U.S.C. 
2675(a). Amendments shall be submitted in writing and signed by the 
claimant or his duly authorized agent or legal representative. Upon the 
timely filing of an amendment to a pending claim, the agency shall have 
six months in which to make a final disposition of the claim as amended 
and the claimant's option under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a) shall not accrue until 
six months after the filing of an amendment.

representative.
    (b) A claim for personal injury may be presented by the injured 
person, his duly authorized agent, or legal representative.
    (c) A claim based on death may be presented by the executor or 
administrator of the decendent's estate, or by any other person legally 
entitled to assert such a claim in accordance with applicable State law.
    (d) A claim for loss wholly compensated by an insurer with the 
rights of a subrogee may be presented by the insurer. A claim for loss

including pain and suffering, the claimant may be required to submit the 
following evidence or information:
    (1) A written report by his attending physician or dentist setting

physical or mental examination by a physician employed by the agency or 
another Federal agency. A copy of the report of the examining physician

request provided that he has, upon request, furnished the report 
referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph and has made or 
agrees to make available to the

Sec. 14.5  Review by legal officers.

    The authority to adjust, determine, compromise, and settle a claim 
under the provisions of section 2672 of title 28, United States Code, 
shall, if the amount of a proposed compromise, settlement, or award 
exceeds $5,000, be exercised by the head of an agency or his designee 
only after review by a legal officer of the agency.

[Order No. 371-66, 31 FR 16616, Dec. 29, 1966, as amended by Order No. 
757-77, 42 FR 62001, Dec. 8, 1977; Order No. 960-81, 46 FR 52355, Oct. 
27, 1981]


<R05>
Sec. 14.6  Dispute resolution techniques and limitations on agency authority.

    (a) Guidance regarding dispute resolution. The administrative 
process established pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2672 and this part 14 is 
intended to serve as an efficient effective forum for rapidly resolving 
tort claims with low costs to all participants. This guidance is 
provided to agencies to improve their use of this administrative process 
and to maximize the benefit achieved through application of prompt, 
fair, and efficient techniques that achieve an informal resolution of 
administrative tort claims without burdening claimants or the agency. 
This section provides guidance to agencies only and does not create or 
establish any right to enforce any provision of this part on behalf of 
any claimant against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or 
any other person. This section also does not require any agency to use 
any dispute resolution technique or process.
    (1) Whenever feasible, administrative claims should be resolved 
through informal discussions, negotiations, and settlements rather than 
through the use of any formal or structured process. At the same time, 
agency personnel processing administrative tort claims should be trained 
in dispute resolution techniques and skills that can contribute to the 
prompt, fair, and efficient resolution of administrative claims.
    (2) An agency may resolve disputed factual questions regarding 
claims against the United States under the FTCA, including 28 U.S.C. 
2671-2680, through the use of any alternative dispute resolution 
technique or process if the agency specifically agrees to employ the 
technique or process, and reserves to itself the discretion to accept or 
reject the determinations made through the use of such technique or 
process.
    (3) Alternative dispute resolution techniques or processes should 
not be

[[Page 262]]

adopted arbitrarily but rather should be based upon a determination that 
use of a particular technique is warranted in the context of a 
particular claim or claims, and that such use will materially contribute 
to the prompt, fair, and efficient resolution of the claims. If 
alternative dispute resolution techniques will not materially contribute 
to the prompt, fair, and efficient resolution of claims, the dispute 
resolution processes otherwise used pursuant to these regulations shall 
be the preferred means of seeking resolution of such claims.
    (b) Alternative dispute resolution--(1) Case-by-case. In order to 
use, and before using, any alternative dispute resolution technique or 
process to facilitate the prompt resolution of disputes that are in 
excess of the agency's delegated authority, an agency may use the 
following procedure to obtain written approval from the Attorney 
General, or his or her designee, to compromise a claim or series of 
related claims.
    (i) A request for settlement authority under paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section shall be directed to the Director, Torts Branch, Civil 
Division, Department of Justice, (``Director'') and shall contain 
information justifying the request, including:
    (A) The basis for concluding that liability exists under the FTCA;
    (B) A description of the proposed alternative dispute resolution 
technique or process and a statement regarding why this proposed form of 
alternative dispute resolution is suitable for the claim or claims;
    (C) A statement reflecting the claimant's or claimants' consent to 
use of the proposed form of alternative dispute resolution, indicating 
the proportion of any additional cost to the United States from use of 
the proposed alternative dispute resolution technique or process that 
shall be borne by the claimant or claimants, and specifying the manner 
and timing of payment of that proportion to be borne by the claimant or 
claimants;
    (D) A statement of how the requested action would facilitate use of 
an alternative dispute resolution technique or process;
    (E) An explanation of the extent to which the decision rendered in 
the alternative dispute resolution proceeding would be made binding upon 
claimants; and,
    (F) An estimate of the potential range of possible settlements 
resulting from use of the proposed alternative dispute resolution 
technique.
    (ii) The Director shall forward a request for expedited settlement 
action under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, along with the 
Director's recommendation as to what action should be taken, to the 
Department of Justice official who has authority to authorize settlement 
of the claim or related claims. If that official approves the request, a 
written authorization shall be promptly forwarded to the requesting 
agency.
    (2) Delegation of authority. Pursuant to, and within the limits of, 
28 U.S.C. 2672, the head of an agency or his or her designee may request 
delegations of authority to make any award, compromise, or settlement 
without the prior written approval of the Attorney General or his or her 
designee in excess of the agency's authority. In considering whether to 
delegate authority pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2672 in excess of previous 
authority conferred upon the agency, consideration shall be given to:
    (i) The extent to which the agency has established an office whose 
responsibilities expressly include the administrative resolution of 
claims presented pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act;
    (ii) The agency's experience with the resolution of administrative 
claims presented pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2672;
    (iii) The Department of Justice's experiences with regard to 
administrative resolution of tort claims arising out of the agency's 
activities.
    (c) Monetary authority. An award, compromise, or settlement of a 
claim by an agency under 28 U.S.C. 2672, in excess of $25,000 or in 
excess of the authority delegated to the agency by the Attorney General 
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2672, whichever is greater, shall be effected only 
with the prior written approval of the Attorney General or his or her 
designee. For purposes of this paragraph, a principal claim and any 
derivative or subrogated claim shall be treated as a single claim.

[[Page 263]]

    (d) Limitations on settlement authority--(1) Policy. An 
administrative claim may be adjusted, determined, compromised, or 
settled by an agency under 28 U.S.C. 2672 only after consultation with 
the Department of Justice when, in the opinion of the agency:
    (i) A new precedent or a new point of law is involved; or
    (ii) A question of policy is or may be involved; or
    (iii) The United States is or may be entitled to indemnity or 
contribution from a third party and the agency is unable to adjust the 
third party claim; or
    (iv) The compromise of a particular claim, as a practical matter, 
will or may control the disposition of a related claim in which the 
amount to be paid may exceed $25,000 or may exceed the authority 
delegated to the agency by the Attorney General pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 
2672, whichever is greater.
    (2) Litigation arising from the same incident. An administrative 
claim may be adjusted, determined, compromised, or settled by an agency 
under 28 U.S.C. 2672 only after consultation with the Department of 
Justice when the agency is informed or is otherwise aware that the 
United States or an employee, agent, or cost-plus contractor of the 
United States is involved in litigation based on a claim arising out of 
the same incident or transaction.
    (e) Procedure. When Department of Justice approval or consultation 
is required, or the advice of the Department of Justice is otherwise to 
be requested, under this section, the written referral or request of the 
Federal agency shall be directed to the Director at any time after 
presentment of a claim to the Federal agency, and shall contain:
    (1) A short and concise statement of the facts and of the reasons 
for the referral or request;
    (2) Copies of relevant portions of the agency's claim file; and
    (3) A statement of the recommendations or views of the agency.

<R05>
Sec. 14.8  Investigation and examination.

    A Federal agency may request any other Federal agency to investigate 
a claim filed under section 2672, title 28, U.S. Code, or to conduct a 
physical examination of a claimant and provide a report of the physical 
examination. Compliance with such requests may be conditioned by a 
Federal agency upon reimbursement by the requesting agency of the 
expense of investigation or examination where reimbursement is 
authorized, as well as where it is required, by statute or regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 14.9  Final denial of claim.

    (a) Final denial of an administrative claim shall be in writing and 
sent to the claimant, his attorney, or legal representative by certified 
or registered mail. The notification of final denial may include a 
statement of the reasons for the denial and shall include a statement 
that, if the claimant is dissatisfied with the agency action, he may 
file suit in an appropriate U.S. District Court not later than 6 months 
after the date of mailing of the notification.
    (b) Prior to the commencement of suit and prior to the expiration of 
the 6-month period provided in 28 U.S.C. 2401(b), a claimant, his duly 
authorized agent, or legal representative, may file a written request 
with the agency for reconsideration of a final denial of a claim under 
paragraph (a) of this section. Upon the timely filing of a request for 
reconsideration the agency shall have 6 months from the date of filing 
in which to make a final disposition of the claim and the claimant's 
option under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a) shall not accrue until 6 months after the 
filing of a request for reconsideration. Final agency action on a 
request for reconsideration shall be effected in accordance with the 
provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.

Sec. 14.10  Action on approved claims.

    (a) Any award, compromise, or settlement in an amount of $2,500 or 
less made pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2672 shall be paid by the head of the

agency. Payment of an award, compromise, or settlement in excess of 
$2,500 shall be obtained by

[[Page 264]]

the agency by forwarding Standard Form 1145 to the Claims Division, 
General Accounting Office. When an award is in excess of $25,000, or in 
excess of the authority delegated to the agency by the Attorney General 
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2672, whichever is greater, Standard Form 1145 
must be accompanied by evidence that the award, compromise, or 
settlement has been approved by the Attorney General or his designee. 
When the use of Standard Form 1145 is required, it shall be executed by 
the claimant, or it shall be accompanied by either a claims settlement 
agreement or a Standard Form 95 executed by the claimant. When a 
claimant is represented by an attorney, the voucher for payment shall 
designate both the claimant and his attorney as payees; the check shall 
be delivered to the attorney, whose address shall appear on the voucher.
    (b) Acceptance by the claimant, his agent, or legal representative, 
of any award, compromise or settlement made pursuant to the provisions 
of section 2672 or 2677 of title 28, United States Code, shall be final 
and conclusive on the claimant, his agent or legal representative and 
any other person on whose behalf or for whose benefit the claim has been 
presented, and shall constitute a complete release of any claim against 
the United States and against any employee of the Government whose act 
or omission gave rise to the claim, by reason of the same subject 
matter.

against such Federal employees and other persons.
    (b) As used in this part:
    (1) Appropriate Federal agency means the Federal agency most closely 
associated with the program out of which the claim or suit arose. When 
it cannot be ascertained which Federal agency is the most closely 
associated with the program out of which the claim or suit arose, the 
responsible Director of the Torts Branch, Civil Division, Department of 
Justice, shall be consulted and will thereafter designate the

the Federal Tort Claims Act is made the exclusive remedy, shall promptly 
deliver to the appropriate Federal agency all process and pleadings 
served on the covered person, or an attested true copy thereof. In

so advise the appropriate Federal agency. The appropriate Federal agency 
shall provide to the United States Attorney for the district embracing 
the place where the action or proceeding is brought, and the responsible 
Branch Director of the Torts Branch, Civil Division, Department of 
Justice, information concerning the commencement of such action or 
proceeding, and copies of all process and pleadings.

withdrawing of certifications, and the removal and defense of, or 
refusal to remove or defend, such civil actions or proceedings shall be 
subject to the instructions and supervision of the Assistant Attorney 
General in charge of the Civil Division or his or her designee.

<R05>
Sec. 16.1  General provisions.

    (a) This subpart contains the rules that the Department of Justice 
follows in processing requests for records under the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552. These rules should be read 
together with the FOIA, which provides additional information about 
access to records maintained by the Department. Requests made by 
individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 
5 U.S.C. 552a, which are processed under subpart D of this part, are 
processed under this subpart also. Information routinely provided to the 
public as part of a regular Department activity (for example, press 
releases issued by the Office of Public Affairs) may be provided to the 
public without following this subpart. As a matter of policy, the 
Department makes discretionary disclosures of records or information 
exempt from disclosure under the FOIA whenever disclosure would not 
foreseeably harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption, but this 
policy does not create any right enforceable in court.
    (b) As used in this subpart, component means each separate bureau, 
office, board, division, commission, service, or administration of the 
Department of Justice.


<R05>
Sec. 16.2  Public reading rooms.

    (a) The Department maintains public reading rooms that contain the 
records that the FOIA requires to be made regularly available for public 
inspection and copying. Each Department component is responsible for 
determining which of the records it generates are required to be made 
available in this way and for making those records available either in 
its own reading room or in the Department's central reading room. Each 
component shall maintain and make available for public inspection and 
copying a current subject-matter index of its reading room records. Each 
index shall be updated regularly, at least quarterly, with respect to 
newly included records.
    (b) The Department maintains public reading rooms or areas at the 
locations listed below:
    (1) Bureau of Prisons--on the Seventh Floor, 500 First Street, NW., 
Washington, DC;
    (2) Civil Rights Division--in Room 930, 320 First Street, NW., 
Washington, DC;
    (3) Community Relations Service--in Suite 2000, 600 E Street, NW., 
Washington, DC;

[[Page 270]]

    (4) Drug Enforcement Administration--in Room W-7216, 700 Army Navy 
Drive, Arlington, Virginia;
    (5) Executive Office for Immigration Review (Board of Immigration 
Appeals)--in Suite 2400, 5107 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church, Virginia;
    (6) Federal Bureau of Investigation--at the J. Edgar Hoover 
Building, 935 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC;
    (7) Foreign Claims Settlement Commission--in Room 6002, 600 E 
Street, NW., Washington, DC;
    (8) Immigration and Naturalization Service--425 I Street, NW., 
Washington, DC;
    (9) Office of Justice Programs--in Room 5430, 810 Seventh Street, 
NW., Washington, DC;
    (10) Pardon Attorney--on the Fourth Floor, 500 First Street, NW., 
Washington, DC;
    (11) Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives--650 
Massachusetts Avenue, NW., Washington, DC;
    (12) United States Attorneys and United States Marshals--at the 
principal offices of the United States Attorneys and the United States 
Marshals, which are listed in most telephone books; and
    (13) All other components of the Department of Justice--in Room 6505 
at the Main Justice Building, 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, 
DC.
    (c) Components shall also make reading room records created by the 
Department on or after November 1, 1996, available electronically at the 
Department's World Wide Web site (which can be found at http://
www.usdoj.gov), through use of the Department's ``Freedom of Information 
Act Home Page.'' This includes each component's index of its reading 
room records, which will indicate which records are available 
electronically.

<R05>
Sec. 16.3  Requirements for making requests.

    (a) How made and addressed. You may make a request for records of 
the Department of Justice by writing directly to the Department 
component that maintains those records. You may find the Department's 
``Freedom of Information Act Reference Guide''--which is available 
electronically at the Department's World Wide Web site, and is available 
in paper form as well--helpful in making your request. For additional 
information about the FOIA, you may refer directly to the statute. If 
you are making a request for records about yourself, see Sec. 16.41(d) 
for additional requirements. If you are making a request for records 
about another individual, either a written authorization signed by that 
individual permitting disclosure of those records to you or proof that 
that individual is deceased (for example, a copy of a death certificate 
or an obituary) will help the processing of your request. Your request 
should be sent to the component's FOIA office at the address listed in 
appendix I to part 16. In most cases, your FOIA request should be sent 
to a component's central FOIA office. For records held by a field office 
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service (INS), however, you must write directly to that 
FBI or INS field office address, which can be found in most telephone 
books or by calling the component's central FOIA office. (The functions 
of each component are summarized in part 0 of this title and in the 
description of the Department and its components in the ``United States 
Government Manual,'' which is issued annually and is available in most 
libraries, as well as for sale from the Government Printing Office's 
Superintendent of Documents. This manual also can be accessed 
electronically at the Government Printing Office's World Wide Web site 
(which can be found at http://www.access.gpo.gov/su--docs).) If you 
cannot determine where within the Department to send your request, you 
may send it to the FOIA/PA Mail Referral Unit, Justice Management 
Division, U.S. Department of Justice, 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., 
Washington, DC 20530-0001. That office will forward your request to the 
component(s) it believes most likely to have the records that you want. 
Your request will be considered received as of the date it is received 
by the proper component's FOIA office. For the quickest possible 
handling, you

[[Page 271]]

should mark both your request letter and the envelope ``Freedom of 
Information Act Request.''
    (b) Description of records sought. You must describe the records 
that you seek in enough detail to enable Department personnel to locate 
them with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, your request 
should include specific information about each record sought, such as 
the date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the 
record. In addition, if you want records about a court case, you should 
provide the title of the case, the court in which the case was filed, 
and the nature of the case. If known, you should include any file 
designations or descriptions for the records that you want. As a general 
rule, the more specific you are about the records or type of records 
that you want, the more likely the Department will be able to locate 
those records in response to your request. If a component determines 
that your request does not reasonably describe records, it shall tell 
you either what additional information is needed or why your request is 
otherwise insufficient. The component also shall give you an opportunity 
to discuss your request so that you may modify it to meet the 
requirements of this section. If your request does not reasonably 
describe the records you seek, the agency's response to your request may 
be delayed.
    (c) Agreement to pay fees. If you make a FOIA request, it shall be 
considered an agreement by you to pay all applicable fees charged under 
Sec. 16.11, up to $25.00, unless you seek a waiver of fees. The 
component responsible for responding to your request ordinarily will 
confirm this agreement in an acknowledgement letter. When making a 
request, you may specify a willingness to pay a greater or lesser 
amount.

1998]


<R05>
Sec. 16.4  Responsibility for responding to requests.

    (a) In general. Except as stated in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of 
this section, the component that first receives a request for a record 
and has possession of that record is the component responsible for 
responding to the request. In determining which records are responsive 
to a request, a component ordinarily will include only records in its 
possession as of the date the component begins its search for them. If 
any other date is used, the component shall inform the requester of that 
date.
    (b) Authority to grant or deny requests. The head of a component, or 
the component head's designee, is authorized to grant or deny any 
request for a record of that component.
    (c) Consultations and referrals. When a component receives a request 
for a record in its possession, it shall determine whether another 
component, or another agency of the Federal Government, is better able 
to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA 
and, if so, whether it should be disclosed as a matter of administrative 
discretion. If the receiving component determines that it is best able 
to process the record in response to the request, then it shall do so. 
If the receiving component determines that it is not best able to 
process the record, then it shall either:
    (1) Respond to the request regarding that record, after consulting 
with the component or agency best able to determine whether to disclose 
it and with any other component or agency that has a substantial 
interest in it; or
    (2) Refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding 
that record to the component best able to determine whether to disclose 
it, or to another agency that originated the record (but only if that 
agency is subject to the FOIA). Ordinarily, the component or agency that 
originated a record will be presumed to be best able to determine 
whether to disclose it.
    (d) Law enforcement information. Whenever a request is made for a 
record containing information that relates to an investigation of a 
possible violation of law and was originated by another component or 
agency, the receiving component shall either refer the responsibility 
for responding to the request regarding that information to that other 
component or agency or consult with that other component or agency.

[[Page 272]]

    (e) Classified information. Whenever a request is made for a record 
containing information that has been classified, or may be appropriate 
for classification, by another component or agency under Executive Order 
12958 or any other executive order concerning the classification of 
records, the receiving component shall refer the responsibility for 
responding to the request regarding that information to the component or 
agency that classified the information, should consider the information 
for classification, or has the primary interest in it, as appropriate. 
Whenever a record contains information that has been derivatively 
classified by a component because it contains information classified by 
another component or agency, the component shall refer the 
responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information 
to the component or agency that classified the underlying information.
    (f) Notice of referral. Whenever a component refers all or any part 
of the responsibility for responding to a request to another component 
or agency, it ordinarily shall notify the requester of the referral and 
inform the requester of the name of each component or agency to which 
the request has been referred and of the part of the request that has 
been referred.
    (g) Timing of responses to consultations and referrals. All 
consultations and referrals will be handled according to the date the 
FOIA request initially was received by the first component or agency, 
not any later date.
    (h) Agreements regarding consultations and referrals. Components may 
make agreements with other components or agencies to eliminate the need 
for consultations or referrals for particular types of records.


<R05>
Sec. 16.5  Timing of responses to requests.

    (a) In general. Components ordinarily shall respond to requests 
according to their order of receipt.
    (b) Multitrack processing. (1) A component may use two or more 
processing tracks by distinguishing between simple and more complex 
requests based on the amount of work and/or time needed to process the 
request, including through limits based on the number of pages involved. 
If a component does so, it shall advise requesters in its slower 
track(s) of the limits of its faster track(s).
    (2) A component using multitrack processing may provide requesters 
in its slower track(s) with an opportunity to limit the scope of their 
requests in order to qualify for faster processing within the specified 
limits of the component's faster track(s). A component doing so will 
contact the requester either by telephone or by letter, whichever is 
more efficient in each case.
    (c) Unusual circumstances. (1) Where the statutory time limits for 
processing a request cannot be met because of ``unusual circumstances,'' 
as defined in the FOIA, and the component determines to extend the time 
limits on that basis, the component shall as soon as practicable notify 
the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances and of the date by 
which processing of the request can be expected to be completed. Where 
the extension is for more than ten working days, the component shall 
provide the requester with an opportunity either to modify the request 
so that it may be processed within the time limits or to arrange an 
alternative time period with the component for processing the request or 
a modified request.
    (2) Where a component reasonably believes that multiple requests 
submitted by a requester, or by a group of requesters acting in concert, 
constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual 
circumstances, and the requests involve clearly related matters, they 
may be aggregated. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters will 
not be aggregated.
    (d) Expedited processing. (1) Requests and appeals will be taken out 
of order and given expedited treatment whenever it is determined that 
they involve:
    (i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could 
reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or 
physical safety of an individual;
    (ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged 
federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in 
disseminating information;
    (iii) The loss of substantial due process rights; or

[[Page 273]]

    (iv) A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which 
there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which 
affect public confidence.
    (2) A request for expedited processing may be made at the time of 
the initial request for records or at any later time. For a prompt 
determination, a request for expedited processing must be received by 
the proper component. Requests based on the categories in paragraphs 
(d)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section must be submitted to the 
component that maintains the records requested. Requests based on the 
category in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section must be submitted to 
the Director of Public Affairs, whose address is: Office of Public 
Affairs, U.S. Department of Justice, Room 1128, 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, 
NW., Washington DC 20530-0001. A component that receives a request that 
must be handled by the Office of Public Affairs shall forward it 
immediately to that office by hand-delivery or fax.
    (3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a 
statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of that person's 
knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting 
expedited processing. For example, a requester within the category in 
paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, if not a full-time member of the 
news media, must establish that he or she is a person whose main 
professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though 
it need not be his or her sole occupation. A requester within the 
category in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section also must establish a 
particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity 
involved in the request, beyond the public's right to know about 
government activity generally. The formality of certification may be 
waived as a matter of administrative discretion.
    (4) Within ten calendar days of its receipt of a request for 
expedited processing, the proper component shall decide whether to grant 
it and shall notify the requester of the decision. If a request for 
expedited treatment is granted, the request shall be given priority and 
shall be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited 
processing is denied, any appeal of that decision shall be acted on 
expeditiously.


<R05>
Sec. 16.6  Responses to requests.

    (a) Acknowledgements of requests. On receipt of a request, a 
component ordinarily shall send an acknowledgement letter to the 
requester which shall confirm the requester's agreement to pay fees 
under Sec. 16.3(c) and provide an assigned request number for further 
reference.
    (b) Grants of requests. Ordinarily, a component shall have twenty 
business days from when a request is received to determine whether to 
grant or deny the request. Once a component makes a determination to 
grant a request in whole or in part, it shall notify the requester in 
writing. The component shall inform the requester in the notice of any 
fee charged under Sec. 16.11 and shall disclose records to the 
requester promptly on payment of any applicable fee. Records disclosed 
in part shall be marked or annotated to show the amount of information 
deleted unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an 
applicable exemption. The location of the information deleted also shall 
be indicated on the record, if technically feasible.
    (c) Adverse determinations of requests. A component making an 
adverse determination denying a request in any respect shall notify the 
requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or 
denials of requests, consist of: a determination to withhold any 
requested record in whole or in part; a determination that a requested 
record does not exist or cannot be located; a determination that a 
record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the 
requester; a determination that what has been requested is not a record 
subject to the FOIA; a determination on any disputed fee matter, 
including a denial of a request for a fee waiver; and a denial of a 
request for expedited treatment. The denial letter shall be signed by 
the head of the component, or the component head's designee, and shall 
include:
    (1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the 
denial;

[[Page 274]]

    (2) A brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial, including any 
FOIA exemption applied by the component in denying the request;
    (3) An estimate of the volume of records or information withheld, in 
number of pages or in some other reasonable form of estimation. This 
estimate does not need to be provided if the volume is otherwise 
indicated through deletions on records disclosed in part, or if 
providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable 
exemption; and
    (4) A statement that the denial may be appealed under Sec. 16.9(a) 
and a description of the requirements of Sec. 16.9(a).


<R05>
Sec. 16.7  Classified information.

    In processing a request for information that is classified under 
Executive Order 12958 (3 CFR, 1996 Comp., p. 333) or any other executive 
order, the originating component shall review the information to 
determine whether it should remain classified. Information determined to 
no longer require classification shall not be withheld on the basis of 
Exemption 1 of the FOIA. On receipt of any appeal involving classified 
information, the Office of Information and Privacy shall take 
appropriate action to ensure compliance with part 17 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 16.8  Business information.

    (a) In general. Business information obtained by the Department from 
a submitter will be disclosed under the FOIA only under this section.
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
    (1) Business information means commercial or financial information 
obtained by the Department from a submitter that may be protected from 
disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA.
    (2) Submitter means any person or entity from whom the Department 
obtains business information, directly or indirectly. The term includes 
corporations; state, local, and tribal governments; and foreign 
governments.
    (c) Designation of business information. A submitter of business 
information will use good-faith efforts to designate, by appropriate 
markings, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time 
thereafter, any portions of its submission that it considers to be 
protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations will 
expire ten years after the date of the submission unless the submitter 
requests, and provides justification for, a longer designation period.
    (d) Notice to submitters. A component shall provide a submitter with 
prompt written notice of a FOIA request or administrative appeal that 
seeks its business information wherever required under paragraph (e) of 
this section, except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, in 
order to give the submitter an opportunity to object to disclosure of 
any specified portion of that information under paragraph (f) of this 
section. The notice shall either describe the business information 
requested or include copies of the requested records or record portions 
containing the information. When notification of a voluminous number of 
submitters is required, notification may be made by posting or 
publishing the notice in a place reasonably likely to accomplish it.
    (e) Where notice is required. Notice shall be given to a submitter 
wherever:
    (1) The information has been designated in good faith by the 
submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under 
Exemption 4; or
    (2) The component has reason to believe that the information may be 
protected from disclosure under Exemption 4.
    (f) Opportunity to object to disclosure. A component will allow a 
submitter a reasonable time to respond to the notice described in 
paragraph (d) of this section and will specify that time period within 
the notice. If a submitter has any objection to disclosure, it is 
required to submit a detailed written statement. The statement must 
specify all grounds for withholding any portion of the information under 
any exemption of the FOIA and, in the case of Exemption 4, it must show 
why the information is a trade secret or commercial or financial 
information that is privileged or confidential. In the event that a 
submitter fails to respond to the notice within the time specified in 
it, the submitter will be considered to have no

[[Page 275]]

objection to disclosure of the information. Information provided by the 
submitter that is not received by the component until after its 
disclosure decision has been made shall not be considered by the 
component. Information provided by a submitter under this paragraph may 
itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.
    (g) Notice of intent to disclose. A component shall consider a 
submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in 
deciding whether to disclose business information. Whenever a component 
decides to disclose business information over the objection of a 
submitter, the component shall give the submitter written notice, which 
shall include:
    (1) A statement of the reason(s) why each of the submitter's 
disclosure objections was not sustained;
    (2) A description of the business information to be disclosed; and
    (3) A specified disclosure date, which shall be a reasonable time 
subsequent to the notice.
    (h) Exceptions to notice requirements. The notice requirements of 
paragraphs (d) and (g) of this section shall not apply if:
    (1) The component determines that the information should not be 
disclosed;
    (2) The information lawfully has been published or has been 
officially made available to the public;
    (3) Disclosure of the information is required by statute (other than 
the FOIA) or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements 
of Executive Order 12600 (3 CFR, 1988 Comp., p. 235); or
    (4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (c) of 
this section appears obviously frivolous--except that, in such a case, 
the component shall, within a reasonable time prior to a specified 
disclosure date, give the submitter written notice of any final decision 
to disclose the information.
    (i) Notice of FOIA lawsuit. Whenever a requester files a lawsuit 
seeking to compel the disclosure of business information, the component 
shall promptly notify the submitter.
    (j) Corresponding notice to requesters. Whenever a component 
provides a submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to 
disclosure under paragraph (d) of this section, the component shall also 
notify the requester(s). Whenever a component notifies a submitter of 
its intent to disclose requested information under paragraph (g) of this 
section, the component shall also notify the requester(s). Whenever a 
submitter files a lawsuit seeking to prevent the disclosure of business 
information, the component shall notify the requester(s).

1998]


<R05>
Sec. 16.9  Appeals.

    (a) Appeals of adverse determinations. If you are dissatisfied with 
a component's response to your request, you may appeal an adverse 
determination denying your request, in any respect, to the Office of 
Information and Privacy, U.S. Department of Justice, Flag Building, 
Suite 570, Washington, DC 20530-0001. You must make your appeal in 
writing and it must be received by the Office of Information and Privacy 
within 60 days of the date of the letter denying your request. Your 
appeal letter may include as much or as little related information as 
you wish, as long as it clearly identifies the component determination 
(including the assigned request number, if known) that you are 
appealing. For the quickest possible handling, you should mark your 
appeal letter and the envelope ``Freedom of Information Act Appeal.'' 
Unless the Attorney General directs otherwise, a Director of the Office 
of Information and Privacy will act on behalf of the Attorney General on 
all appeals under this section, except that:
    (1) In the case of an adverse determination by the Deputy Attorney 
General or the Associate Attorney General, the Attorney General or the 
Attorney General's designee will act on the appeal;
    (2) An adverse determination by the Attorney General will be the 
final action of the Department; and
    (3) An appeal ordinarily will not be acted on if the request becomes 
a matter of FOIA litigation.
    (b) Responses to appeals. The decision on your appeal will be made 
in writing.

[[Page 276]]

A decision affirming an adverse determination in whole or in part shall 
contain a statement of the reason(s) for the affirmance, including any 
FOIA exemption(s) applied, and will inform you of the FOIA provisions 
for court review of the decision. If the adverse determination is 
reversed or modified on appeal, in whole or in part, you will be 
notified in a written decision and your request will be reprocessed in 
accordance with that appeal decision.
    (c) When appeal is required. If you wish to seek review by a court 
of any adverse determination, you must first appeal it under this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 16.10  Preservation of records.

    Each component shall preserve all correspondence pertaining to the 
requests that it receives under this subpart, as well as copies of all 
requested records, until disposition or destruction is authorized by 
title 44 of the United States Code or the National Archives and Records 
Administration's General Records Schedule 14. Records will not be 
disposed of while they are the subject of a pending request, appeal, or 
lawsuit under the FOIA.


<R05>
Sec. 16.11  Fees.

    (a) In general. Components shall charge for processing requests 
under the FOIA in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, except 
where fees are limited under paragraph (d) of this section or where a 
waiver or reduction of fees is granted under paragraph (k) of this 
section. A component ordinarily shall collect all applicable fees before 
sending copies of requested records to a requester. Requesters must pay 
fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United 
States.
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
    (1) Commercial use request means a request from or on behalf of a 
person who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers his or 
her commercial, trade, or profit interests, which can include furthering 
those interests through litigation. Components shall determine, whenever 
reasonably possible, the use to which a requester will put the requested 
records. When it appears that the requester will put the records to a 
commercial use, either because of the nature of the request itself or 
because a component has reasonable cause to doubt a requester's stated 
use, the component shall provide the requester a reasonable opportunity 
to submit further clarification.
    (2) Direct costs means those expenses that an agency actually incurs 
in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use 
requests, reviewing) records to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs 
include, for example, the salary of the employee performing the work 
(the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to 
cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplication machinery. Not 
included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as the costs of 
space and heating or lighting of the facility in which the records are 
kept.
    (3) Duplication means the making of a copy of a record, or of the 
information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. 
Copies can take the form of paper, microform, audiovisual materials, or 
electronic records (for example, magnetic tape or disk), among others. 
Components shall honor a requester's specified preference of form or 
format of disclosure if the record is readily reproducible with 
reasonable efforts in the requested form or format by the office 
responding to the request.
    (4) Educational institution means a preschool, a public or private 
elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate higher 
education, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution 
of professional education, or an institution of vocational education, 
that operates a program of scholarly research. To be in this category, a 
requester must show that the request is authorized by and is made under 
the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not 
sought for a commercial use but are sought to further scholarly 
research.
    (5) Noncommercial scientific institution means an institution that 
is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis, as that term is defined in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and that is operated solely for the 
purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not 
intended to promote any particular product or industry. To be in this 
category, a requester must show that the

[[Page 277]]

request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying 
institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but 
are sought to further scientific research.
    (6) Representative of the news media, or news media requester, means 
any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and 
operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term ``news'' 
means information that is about current events or that would be of 
current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include 
television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and 
publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances where they can 
qualify as disseminators of ``news'') who make their products available 
for purchase or subscription by the general public. For ``freelance'' 
journalists to be regarded as working for a news organization, they must 
demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that 
organization. A publication contract would be the clearest proof, but 
components shall also look to the past publication record of a requester 
in making this determination. To be in this category, a requester must 
not be seeking the requested records for a commercial use. However, a 
request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the 
requester shall not be considered to be for a commercial use.
    (7) Review means the examination of a record located in response to 
a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from 
disclosure. It also includes processing any record for disclosure--for 
example, doing all that is necessary to redact it and prepare it for 
disclosure. Review costs are recoverable even if a record ultimately is 
not disclosed. Review time includes time spent considering any formal 
objection to disclosure made by a business submitter under Sec. 16.8, 
but does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues 
regarding the application of exemptions.
    (8) Search means the process of looking for and retrieving records 
or information responsive to a request. It includes page-by-page or 
line-by-line identification of information within records and also 
includes reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from 
records maintained in electronic form or format. Components shall ensure 
that searches are done in the most efficient and least expensive manner 
reasonably possible. For example, components shall not search line-by-
line where duplicating an entire document would be quicker and less 
expensive.
    (c) Fees. In responding to FOIA requests, components shall charge 
the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted 
under paragraph (k) of this section:
    (1) Search. (i) Search fees shall be charged for all requests--other 
than requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific 
institutions, or representatives of the news media--subject to the 
limitations of paragraph (d) of this section. Components may charge for 
time spent searching even if they do not locate any responsive record or 
if they withhold the record(s) located as entirely exempt from 
disclosure.
    (ii) For each quarter hour spent by clerical personnel in searching 
for and retrieving a requested record, the fee will be $4.00. Where a 
search and retrieval cannot be performed entirely by clerical 
personnel--for example, where the identification of records within the 
scope of a request requires the use of professional personnel--the fee 
will be $7.00 for each quarter hour of search time spent by professional 
personnel. Where the time of managerial personnel is required, the fee 
will be $10.25 for each quarter hour of time spent by those personnel.
    (iii) For computer searches of records, requesters will be charged 
the direct costs of conducting the search, although certain requesters 
(as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) will be charged no 
search fee and certain other requesters (as provided in paragraph (d)(3) 
of this section) will be entitled to the cost equivalent of two hours of 
manual search time without charge. These direct costs will include the 
cost of operating a central processing unit for that portion of 
operating time that is directly attributable to searching for responsive 
records, as well as the costs of operator/programmer salary 
apportionable to the search.

[[Page 278]]

    (2) Duplication. Duplication fees will be charged to all requesters, 
subject to the limitations of paragraph (d) of this section. For a paper 
photocopy of a record (no more than one copy of which need be supplied), 
the fee will be ten cents per page. For copies produced by computer, 
such as tapes or printouts, components will charge the direct costs, 
including operator time, of producing the copy. For other forms of 
duplication, components will charge the direct costs of that 
duplication.
    (3) Review. Review fees will be charged to requesters who make a 
commercial use request. Review fees will be charged only for the initial 
record review--in other words, the review done when a component 
determines whether an exemption applies to a particular record or record 
portion at the initial request level. No charge will be made for review 
at the administrative appeal level for an exemption already applied. 
However, records or record portions withheld under an exemption that is 
subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed again to determine 
whether any other exemption not previously considered applies; the costs 
of that review are chargeable where it is made necessary by such a 
change of circumstances. Review fees will be charged at the same rates 
as those charged for a search under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this 
section.
    (d) Limitations on charging fees. (1) No search fee will be charged 
for requests by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific 
institutions, or representatives of the news media.
    (2) No search fee or review fee will be charged for a quarter-hour 
period unless more than half of that period is required for search or 
review.
    (3) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, 
components will provide without charge:
    (i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent); and
    (ii) The first two hours of search (or the cost equivalent).
    (4) Whenever a total fee calculated under paragraph (c) of this 
section is $14.00 or less for any request, no fee will be charged.
    (5) The provisions of paragraphs (d) (3) and (4) of this section 
work together. This means that for requesters other than those seeking 
records for a commercial use, no fee will be charged unless the cost of 
search in excess of two hours plus the cost of duplication in excess of 
100 pages totals more than $14.00.
    (e) Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00. When a component 
determines or estimates that the fees to be charged under this section 
will amount to more than $25.00, the component shall notify the 
requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, unless the 
requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those 
anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, the 
component shall advise the requester that the estimated fee may be only 
a portion of the total fee. In cases in which a requester has been 
notified that actual or estimated fees amount to more than $25.00, the 
request shall not be considered received and further work shall not be 
done on it until the requester agrees to pay the anticipated total fee. 
Any such agreement should be memorialized in writing. A notice under 
this paragraph will offer the requester an opportunity to discuss the 
matter with Department personnel in order to reformulate the request to 
meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.
    (f) Charges for other services. Apart from the other provisions of 
this section, when a component chooses as a matter of administrative 
discretion to provide a special service--such as certifying that records 
are true copies or sending them by other than ordinary mail--the direct 
costs of providing the service ordinarily will be charged.
    (g) Charging interest. Components may charge interest on any unpaid 
bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the 
requester. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate provided in 31 
U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of the billing until payment 
is received by the component. Components will follow the provisions of 
the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as 
amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of 
consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.

[[Page 279]]

    (h) Aggregating requests. Where a component reasonably believes that 
a requester or a group of requesters acting together is attempting to 
divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding 
fees, the component may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. 
Components may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 
30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. Where requests are 
separated by a longer period, components will aggregate them only where 
there exists a solid basis for determining that aggregation is warranted 
under all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving 
unrelated matters will not be aggregated.
    (i) Advance payments. (1) For requests other than those described in 
paragraphs (i)(2) and (3) of this section, a component shall not require 
the requester to make an advance payment--in other words, a payment made 
before work is begun or continued on a request. Payment owed for work 
already completed (i.e., a prepayment before copies are sent to a 
requester) is not an advance payment.
    (2) Where a component determines or estimates that a total fee to be 
charged under this section will be more than $250.00, it may require the 
requester to make an advance payment of an amount up to the amount of 
the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request, 
except where it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a 
requester that has a history of prompt payment.
    (3) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly 
charged FOIA fee to any component or agency within 30 days of the date 
of billing, a component may require the requester to pay the full amount 
due, plus any applicable interest, and to make an advance payment of the 
full amount of any anticipated fee, before the component begins to 
process a new request or continues to process a pending request from 
that requester.
    (4) In cases in which a component requires advance payment or 
payment due under paragraph (i)(2) or (3) of this section, the request 
shall not be considered received and further work will not be done on it 
until the required payment is received.
    (j) Other statutes specifically providing for fees. The fee schedule 
of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that 
specifically requires an agency to set and collect fees for particular 
types of records. Where records responsive to requests are maintained 
for distribution by agencies operating such statutorily based fee 
schedule programs, components will inform requesters of the steps for 
obtaining records from those sources so that they may do so most 
economically.
    (k) Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees. (1) Records 
responsive to a request will be furnished without charge or at a charge 
reduced below that established under paragraph (c) of this section where 
a component determines, based on all available information, that the 
requester has demonstrated that:
    (i) Disclosure of the requested information is in the public 
interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public 
understanding of the operations or activities of the government, and
    (ii) Disclosure of the information is not primarily in the 
commercial interest of the requester.
    (2) To determine whether the first fee waiver requirement is met, 
components will consider the following factors:
    (i) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested 
records concerns ``the operations or activities of the government.'' The 
subject of the requested records must concern identifiable operations or 
activities of the federal government, with a connection that is direct 
and clear, not remote or attenuated.
    (ii) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: 
Whether the disclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an understanding 
of government operations or activities. The disclosable portions of the 
requested records must be meaningfully informative about government 
operations or activities in order to be ``likely to contribute'' to an 
increased public understanding of those operations or activities. The 
disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in 
either a duplicative or a substantially identical form, would not

[[Page 280]]

be as likely to contribute to such understanding where nothing new would 
be added to the public's understanding.
    (iii) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the 
public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the 
requested information will contribute to ``public understanding.'' The 
disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad 
audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the 
individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in 
the subject area and ability and intention to effectively convey 
information to the public shall be considered. It shall be presumed that 
a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.
    (iv) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: 
Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute ``significantly'' to 
public understanding of government operations or activities. The 
public's understanding of the subject in question, as compared to the 
level of public understanding existing prior to the disclosure, must be 
enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. Components shall not 
make value judgments about whether information that would contribute 
significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of 
the government is ``important'' enough to be made public.
    (3) To determine whether the second fee waiver requirement is met, 
components will consider the following factors:
    (i) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether 
the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the 
requested disclosure. Components shall consider any commercial interest 
of the requester (with reference to the definition of ``commercial use'' 
in paragraph (b)(1) of this section), or of any person on whose behalf 
the requester may be acting, that would be furthered by the requested 
disclosure. Requesters shall be given an opportunity in the 
administrative process to provide explanatory information regarding this 
consideration.
    (ii) The primary interest in disclosure: Whether any identified 
commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in 
comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is 
``primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.'' A fee waiver 
or reduction is justified where the public interest standard is 
satisfied and that public interest is greater in magnitude than that of 
any identified commercial interest in disclosure. Components ordinarily 
shall presume that where a news media requester has satisfied the public 
interest standard, the public interest will be the interest primarily 
served by disclosure to that requester. Disclosure to data brokers or 
others who merely compile and market government information for direct 
economic return shall not be presumed to primarily serve the public 
interest.
    (4) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the 
requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver shall be granted for those 
records.
    (5) Requests for the waiver or reduction of fees should address the 
factors listed in paragraphs (k)(2) and (3) of this section, insofar as 
they apply to each request. Components will exercise their discretion to 
consider the cost-effectiveness of their investment of administrative 
resources in this decisionmaking process, however, in deciding to grant 
waivers or reductions of fees.

    Source: Order No. 919-80, 45 FR 83210, Dec. 18, 1980, unless 
otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 16.21  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart sets forth procedures to be followed with respect 
to the production or disclosure of any material contained in the files 
of the Department, any information relating to material contained in the 
files of the Department, or any information acquired

[[Page 281]]

by any person while such person was an employee of the Department as a 
part of the performance of that person's official duties or because of 
that person's official status:
    (1) In all federal and state proceedings in which the United States 
is a party; and
    (2) In all federal and state proceedings in which the United States 
is not a party, including any proceedings in which the Department is 
representing a government employee solely in that employee's individual 
capacity, when a subpoena, order, or other demand (hereinafter 
collectively referred to as a ``demand'') of a court or other authority 
is issued for such material or information.
    (b) For purposes of this subpart, the term employee of the 
Department includes all officers and employees of the United States 
appointed by, or subject to the supervision, jurisdiction, or control of 
the Attorney General of the United States, including U.S. Attorneys, 
U.S. Marshals, U.S. Trustees and members of the staffs of those 
officials.
    (c) Nothing in this subpart is intended to impede the appropriate 
disclosure, in the absence of a demand, of information by Department law 
enforcement agencies to federal, state, local and foreign law 
enforcement, prosecutive, or regulatory agencies.
    (d) This subpart is intended only to provide guidance for the 
internal operations of the Department of Justice, and is not intended 
to, and does not, and may not be relied upon to create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party 
against the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 16.22  General prohibition of production or disclosure in Federal and 

State proceedings in which the United States is not a party.

    (a) In any federal or state case or matter in which the United 
States is not a party, no employee or former employee of the Department 
of Justice shall, in response to a demand, produce any material 
contained in the files of the Department, or disclose any information 
relating to or based upon material contained in the files of the 
Department, or disclose any information or produce any material acquired 
as part of the performance of that person's official duties or because 
of that person's official status without prior approval of the proper 
Department official in accordance with Sec. Sec. 16.24 and 16.25 of 
this part.
    (b) Whenever a demand is made upon an employee or former employee as 
described in paragraph (a) of this section, the employee shall 
immediately notify the U.S. Attorney for the district where the issuing 
authority is located. The responsible United States Attorney shall 
follow procedures set forth in Sec. 16.24 of this part.
    (c) If oral testimony is sought by a demand in any case or matter in 
which the United States is not a party, an affidavit, or, if that is not 
feasible, a statement by the party seeking the testimony or by his 
attorney, setting forth a summary of the testimony sought and its 
relevance to the proceeding, must be furnished to the responsible U.S. 
Attorney. Any authorization for testimony by a present or former 
employee of the Department shall be limited to the scope of the demand 
as summarized in such statement.
    (d) When information other than oral testimony is sought by a 
demand, the responsible U.S. Attorney shall request a summary of the 
information sought and its relevance to the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 16.23  General disclosure authority in Federal and State proceedings in 

which the United States is a party.

    (a) Every attorney in the Department of Justice in charge of any 
case or matter in which the United States is a party is authorized, 
after consultation with the ``originating component'' as defined in 
Sec. 16.24(a) of this part, to reveal and furnish to any person, 
including an actual or prospective witness, a grand jury, counsel, or a 
court, either during or preparatory to a proceeding, such testimony, and 
relevant unclassified material, documents, or information secured by any 
attorney, or investigator of the Department of Justice, as such attorney 
shall deem necessary or desirable to the discharge of the attorney's 
official duties: Provided, Such an attorney shall consider, with respect 
to any disclosure, the factors set

[[Page 282]]

forth in Sec. 16.26(a) of this part: And further provided, An attorney 
shall not reveal or furnish any material, documents, testimony or 
information when, in the attorney's judgment, any of the factors 
specified in Sec. 16.26(b) exists, without the express prior approval 
by the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the division responsible 
for the case or proceeding, the Director of the Executive Office for 
United States Trustees (hereinafter referred to as ``the EOUST''), or 
such persons' designees.
    (b) An attorney may seek higher level review at any stage of a 
proceeding, including prior to the issuance of a court order, when the 
attorney determines that a factor specified in Sec. 16.26(b) exists or 
foresees that higher level approval will be required before disclosure 
of the information or testimony in question. Upon referral of a matter 
under this subsection, the responsible Assistant Attorney General, the 
Director of EOUST, or their designees shall follow procedures set forth 
in Sec. 16.24 of this part.
    (c) If oral testimony is sought by a demand in a case or matter in 
which the United States is a party, an affidavit, or, if that is not 
feasible, a statement by the party seeking the testimony or by the 
party's attorney setting forth a summary of the testimony sought must be 
furnished to the Department attorney handling the case or matter.


<R05>
Sec. 16.24  Procedure in the event of a demand where disclosure is not 

otherwise authorized.

    (a) Whenever a matter is referred under Sec. 16.22 of this part to 
a U.S. Attorney or, under Sec. 16.23 of this part, to an Assistant 
Attorney General, the Director of the EOUST, or their designees 
(hereinafter collectively referred to as the ``responsible official''), 
the responsible official shall immediately advise the official in charge 
of the bureau, division, office, or agency of the Department that was 
responsible for the collection, assembly, or other preparation of the 
material demanded or that, at the time the person whose testimony was 
demanded acquired the information in question, employed such person 
(hereinafter collectively referred to as the ``originating component''), 
or that official's designee. In any instance in which the responsible 
official is also the official in charge of the originating component, 
the responsible official may perform all functions and make all 
determinations that this regulation vests in the originating component.
    (b) The responsible official, subject to the terms of paragraph (c) 
of this section, may authorize the appearance and testimony of a present 
or former Department employee, or the production of material from 
Department files if:
    (1) There is no objection after inquiry of the originating 
component;
    (2) The demanded disclosure, in the judgment of the responsible 
official, is appropriate under the factors specified in Sec. 16.26(a) 
of this part; and
    (3) None of the factors specified in Sec. 16.26(b) of this part 
exists with respect to the demanded disclosure.
    (c) It is Department policy that the responsible official shall, 
following any necessary consultation with the originating component, 
authorize testimony by a present or former employee of the Department or 
the production of material from Department files without further 
authorization from Department officials whenever possible: Provided, 
That, when information is collected, assembled, or prepared in 
connection with litigation or an investigation supervised by a division 
of the Department or by the EOUST, the Assistant Attorney General in 
charge of such a division or the Director of the EOUST may require that 
the originating component obtain the division's or the EOUST's approval 
before authorizing a responsible official to disclose such information. 
Prior to authorizing such testimony or production, however, the 
responsible official shall, through negotiation and, if necessary, 
appropriate motions, seek to limit the demand to information, the 
disclosure of which would not be inconsistent with the considerations 
specified in Sec. 16.26 of this part.
    (d)(1) In a case in which the United States is not a party, if the 
responsible U.S. attorney and the originating component disagree with 
respect to the appropriateness of demanded testimony or of a particular 
disclosure, or if they

[[Page 283]]

agree that such testimony or such a disclosure should not be made, they 
shall determine if the demand involves information that was collected, 
assembled, or prepared in connection with litigation or an investigation 
supervised by a division of this Department or the EOUST. If so, the 
U.S. attorney shall notify the Director of the EOUST or the Assistant 
Attorney General in charge of the division responsible for such 
litigation or investigation, who may:
    (i) Authorize personally or through a Deputy Assistant Attorney 
General, the demanded testimony or other disclosure of the information 
if such testimony or other disclosure, in the Assistant or Deputy 
Assistant Attorney General's judgment or in the judgment of the Director 
of the EOUST, is consistent with the factors specified in Sec. 16.26(a) 
of this part, and none of the factors specified in Sec. 16.26(b) of 
this part exists with respect to the demanded disclosure;
    (ii) Authorize, personally or by a designee, the responsible 
official, through negotiations and, if necessary, appropriate motions, 
to seek to limit the demand to matters, the disclosure of which, through 
testimony or documents, considerations specified in Sec. 16.26 of this 
part, and otherwise to take all appropriate steps to limit the scope or 
obtain the withdrawal of a demand; or
    (iii) If, after all appropriate steps have been taken to limit the 
scope or obtain the withdrawal of a demand, the Director of the EOUST or 
the Assistant or Deputy Assistant Attorney General does not authorize 
the demanded testimony or other disclosure, refer the matter, personally 
or through a Deputy Assistant Attorney General, for final resolution to 
the Deputy or Associate Attorney General, as indicated in Sec. 16.25 of 
this part.
    (2) If the demand for testimony or other disclosure in such a case 
does not involve information that was collected, assembled, or prepared 
in connection with litigation or an investigation supervised by a 
division of this Department, the originating component shall decide 
whether disclosure is appropriate, except that, when especially 
significant issues are raised, the responsible official may refer the 
matter to the Deputy or Associate Attorney General, as indicated in 
Sec. 16.25 of this part. If the originating component determines that 
disclosure would not be appropriate and the responsible official does 
not refer the matter for higher level review, the responsible official 
shall take all appropriate steps to limit the scope or obtain the 
withdrawal of a demand.
    (e) In a case in which the United States is a party, the Assistant 
General or the Director of the EOUST responsible for the case or matter, 
or such persons' designees, are authorized, after consultation with the 
originating component, to exercise the authorities specified in 
paragraph (d)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section: Provided, That if a 
demand involves information that was collected, assembled, or prepared 
originally in connection with litigation or an investigation supervised 
by another unit of the Department, the responsible official shall notify 
the other division or the EOUST concerning the demand and the 
anticipated response. If two litigating units of the Department are 
unable to resolve a disagreement concerning disclosure, the Assistant 
Attorneys General in charge of the two divisions in disagreement, or the 
Director of the EOUST and the appropriate Assistant Attorney General, 
may refer the matter to the Deputy or Associate Attorney General, as 
indicated in Sec. 16.25(b) of this part.
    (f) In any case or matter in which the responsible official and the 
originating component agree that it would not be appropriate to 
authorize testimony or otherwise to disclose the information demanded, 
even if a court were so to require, no Department attorney responding to 
the demand should make any representation that implies that the 
Department would, in fact, comply with the demand if directed to do so 
by a court. After taking all appropriate steps in such cases to limit 
the scope or obtain the withdrawal of a demand, the responsible official 
shall refer the matter to the Deputy or Associate Attorney General, as 
indicated in Sec. 16.25 of this part.

[[Page 284]]

    (g) In any case or matter in which the Attorney General is 
personally involved in the claim of privilege, the responsible official 
may consult with the Attorney General and proceed in accord with the 
Attorney General's instructions without subsequent review by the Deputy 
or Associate Attorney General.


<R05>
Sec. 16.25  Final action by the Deputy or Associate Attorney General.

    (a) Unless otherwise indicated, all matters to be referred under 
Sec. 16.24 by an Assistant Attorney General, the Director of the EOUST, 
or such person's designees to the Deputy or Associate Attorney General 
shall be referred (1) to the Deputy Attorney General, if the matter is 
referred personally by or through the designee of an Assistant Attorney 
General who is within the general supervision of the Deputy Attorney 
General, or (2) to the Associate Attorney General, in all other cases.
    (b) All other matters to be referred under Sec. 16.24 to the Deputy 
or Associate Attorney General shall be referred (1) to the Deputy 
Attorney General, if the originating component is within the supervision 
of the Deputy Attorney General or is an independent agency that, for 
administrative purposes, is within the Department of Justice, or (2) to 
the Associate Attorney General, if the originating component is within 
the supervision of the Associate Attorney General.
    (c) Upon referral, the Deputy or Associate Attorney General shall 
make the final decision and give notice thereof to the responsible 
official and such other persons as circumstances may warrant.


<R05>
Sec. 16.26  Considerations in determining whether production or disclosure 

should be made pursuant to a demand.

    (a) In deciding whether to make disclosures pursuant to a demand, 
Department officials and attorneys should consider:
    (1) Whether such disclosure is appropriate under the rules of 
procedure governing the case or matter in which the demand arose, and
    (2) Whether disclosure is appropriate under the relevant substantive 
law concerning privilege.
    (b) Among the demands in response to which disclosure will not be 
made by any Department official are those demands with respect to which 
any of the following factors exist:
    (1) Disclosure would violate a statute, such as the income tax laws, 
26 U.S.C. 6103 and 7213, or a rule of procedure, such as the grand jury 
secrecy rule, F.R.Cr.P., Rule 6(e),
    (2) Disclosure would violate a specific regulation;
    (3) Disclosure would reveal classified information, unless 
appropriately declassified by the originating agency,
    (4) Disclosure would reveal a confidential source or informant, 
unless the investigative agency and the source or informant have no 
objection,
    (5) Disclosure would reveal investigatory records compiled for law 
enforcement purposes, and would interfere with enforcement proceedings 
or disclose investigative techniques and procedures the effectiveness of 
which would thereby be impaired,
    (6) Disclosure would improperly reveal trade secrets without the 
owner's consent.
    (c) In all cases not involving considerations specified in 
paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section, the Deputy or 
Associate Attorney General will authorize disclosure unless, in that 
person's judgment, after considering paragraph (a) of this section, 
disclosure is unwarranted. The Deputy or Associate Attorney General will 
not approve disclosure if the circumstances specified in paragraphs 
(b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section exist. The Deputy or Associate 
Attorney General will not approve disclosure if any of the conditions in 
paragraphs (b)(4) through (b)(6) of this section exist, unless the 
Deputy or Associate Attorney General determines that the administration 
of justice requires disclosure. In this regard, if disclosure is 
necessary to pursue a civil or criminal prosecution or affirmative 
relief, such as an injunction, consideration shall be given to:
    (1) The seriousness of the violation or crime involved,
    (2) The past history or criminal record of the violator or accused,

[[Page 285]]

    (3) The importance of the relief sought,
    (4) The importance of the legal issues presented,
    (5) Other matters brought to the attention of the Deputy or 
Associate Attorney General.
    (d) Assistant Attorneys General, U.S. Attorneys, the Director of the 
EOUST, U.S. Trustees, and their designees, are authorized to issue 
instructions to attorneys and to adopt supervisory practices, consistent 
with this subpart, in order to help foster consistent application of the 
foregoing standards and the requirements of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 16.27  Procedure in the event a department decision concerning a demand 

is not made prior to the time a response to the demand is required.

    If response to a demand is required before the instructions from the 
appropriate Department official are received, the responsible official 
or other Department attorney designated for the purpose shall appear and 
furnish the court or other authority with a copy of the regulations 
contained in this subpart and inform the court or other authority that 
the demand has been or is being, as the case may be, referred for the 
prompt consideration of the appropriate Department official and shall 
respectfully request the court or authority to stay the demand pending 
receipt of the requested instructions.


<R05>
Sec. 16.28  Procedure in the event of an adverse ruling.

    If the court or other authority declines to stay the effect of the 
demand in response to a request made in accordance with Sec. 16.27 of 
this chapter pending receipt of instructions, or if the court or other 
authority rules that the demand must be complied with irrespective of 
instructions rendered in accordance with Sec. Sec. 16.24 and 16.25 of 
this part not to produce the material or disclose the information 
sought, the employee or former employee upon whom the demand has been 
made shall, if so directed by the responsible Department official, 
respectfully decline to comply with the demand. See United States ex 
rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951).


<R05>
Sec. 16.29  Delegation by Assistant Attorneys General.

    With respect to any function that this subpart permits the designee 
of an Assistant Attorney General to perform, the Assistant Attorneys 
General are authorized to delegate their authority, in any case or 
matter or any category of cases or matters, to subordinate division 
officials or U.S. attorneys, as appropriate.

   Appendix to Subpart B of Part 16--Redelegation of Authority to the 
Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Litigation, Antitrust Division, To 
      Authorize Production or Disclosure of Material or Information

    1. By virtue of the authority vested in me by 28 CFR 16.23(b)(1) the 
authority delegated to me by that section to authorize the production of 
material and disclosure of information described in 28 CFR 16.21(a) is 
hereby redelegated to the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for 
Litigation, Antitrust Division.
    2. This directive shall become effective on the date of its 
publication in the Federal Register.

<R05>
Sec. 16.30  Purpose and scope.

    This subpart contains the regulations of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) concerning procedures to be followed when the 
subject of an identification record requests production of that record 
to review it or to obtain a change, correction, or updating of that 
record.

[Order No. 2258-99, 64 FR 52226, Sept. 28, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 16.31  Definition of identification record.

    An FBI identification record, often referred to as a ``rap sheet,'' 
is a listing of certain information taken from fingerprint submissions 
retained by the FBI in connection with arrests and, in

[[Page 286]]

some instances, includes information taken from fingerprints submitted 
in connection with federal employment, naturalization, or military 
service. The identification record includes the name of the agency or 
institution that submitted the fingerprints to the FBI. If the 
fingerprints concern a criminal offense, the identification record 
includes the date of arrest or the date the individual was received by 
the agency submitting the fingerprints, the arrest charge, and the 
disposition of the arrest if known to the FBI. All arrest data included 
in an identification record are obtained from fingerprint submissions, 
disposition reports, and other reports submitted by agencies having 
criminal justice responsibilities. Therefore, the FBI Criminal Justice 
Information Services Division is not the source of the arrest data 
reflected on an identification record.

<R05>
Sec. 16.40  General provisions.

    (a) Purpose and scope. This subpart contains the rules that the 
Department of Justice follows under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 
552a. These rules should be read together with the Privacy Act, which 
provides additional information about records maintained on individuals. 
The rules in this subpart apply to all records in systems of records 
maintained by the Department that are retrieved by an individual's name 
or personal identifier. They describe the procedures by which 
individuals may request access to records about themselves, request 
amendment or correction of those records, and request an accounting of 
disclosures of those by the Department. In addition, the Department 
processes all Privacy Act requests for access to records under the 
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, following the rules 
contained in subpart A of this part, which gives requests the benefit of 
both statutes.
    (b) Definitions. As used in this subpart:
    (1) Component means each separate bureau, office, board, division, 
commission, service, or administration of the Department of Justice.
    (2) Request for access to a record means a request made under 
Privacy Act subsection (d)(1).
    (3) Request for amendment or correction of a record means a request 
made under Privacy Act subsection (d)(2).
    (4) Request for an accounting means a request made under Privacy Act 
subsection (c)(3).
    (5) Requester means an individual who makes a request for access, a 
request for amendment or correction, or a request for an accounting 
under the Privacy Act.
    (c) Authority to request records for a law enforcement purpose. The 
head of a component or a United States Attorney, or either's designee, 
is authorized to make written requests under subsection (b)(7) of the 
Privacy Act for records maintained by other agencies that are necessary 
to carry out an authorized law enforcement activity.

<R05>
Sec. 16.41  Requests for access to records.

    (a) How made and addressed. You may make a request for access to a 
Department of Justice record about yourself by appearing in person or by 
writing directly to the Department component that maintains the record. 
Your request should be sent or delivered to the component's Privacy Act 
office at the address listed in appendix I to this part. In most cases, 
a component's central Privacy Act office is the place to send a Privacy 
Act request. For records held by a field office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) or the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), 
however, you must write directly to that FBI or INS field office 
address, which can be found in most telephone books or by calling the 
component's central Privacy Act office. (The functions of each component 
are summarized in Part 0 of this title and in the description of the 
Department and its components in the ``United States Government 
Manual,'' which is issued annually and is available in most libraries, 
as well as for sale from the Government Printing Office's Superintendent 
of Documents. This manual also can be accessed electronically at the 
Government Printing Office's World Wide Web site (which can be found at 
http://www.access.gpo.gov/su--docs). If you cannot determine where 
within the Department to send your request, you may send it to the FOIA/
PA Mail Referral Unit, Justice Management Division, U.S. Department of 
Justice, 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20530-0001, and 
that office will forward it to the component(s) it believes most likely 
to have the records that you seek. For the quickest possible handling, 
you should mark both your request letter and the envelope ``Privacy Act 
Request.''
    (b) Description of records sought. You must describe the records 
that you want in enough detail to enable Department personnel to locate 
the system of records containing them with a reasonable amount of 
effort. Whenever possible, your request should describe the records 
sought, the time periods in which you believe they were compiled, and 
the name or identifying number of each system of records in which you 
believe they are kept. The Department

[[Page 288]]

publishes notices in the Federal Register that describe its components' 
systems of records. A description of the Department's systems of records 
also may be found as part of the ``Privacy Act Compilation'' published 
by the National Archives and Records Administration's Office of the 
Federal Register. This compilation is available in most large reference 
and university libraries. This compilation also can be accessed 
electronically at the Government Printing Office's World Wide Web site 
(which can be found at http://www.access.gpo.gov/su--docs).
    (c) Agreement to pay fees. If you make a Privacy Act request for 
access to records, it shall be considered an agreement by you to pay all 
applicable fees charged under Sec. 16.49, up to $25.00. The component 
responsible for responding to your request ordinarily shall confirm this 
agreement in an acknowledgement letter. When making a request, you may 
specify a willingness to pay a greater or lesser amount.
    (d) Verification of identity. When you make a request for access to 
records about yourself, you must verify your identity. You must state 
your full name, current address, and date and place of birth. You must 
sign your request and your signature must either be notarized or 
submitted by you under 28 U.S.C. 1746, a law that permits statements to 
be made under penalty of perjury as a substitute for notarization. While 
no specific form is required, you may obtain forms for this purpose from 
the FOIA/PA Mail Referral Unit, Justice Management Division, U.S. 
Department of Justice, 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 
20530-0001. In order to help the identification and location of 
requested records, you may also, at your option, include your social 
security number.
    (e) Verification of guardianship. When making a request as the 
parent or guardian of a minor or as the guardian of someone determined 
by a court to be incompetent, for access to records about that 
individual, you must establish:
    (1) The identity of the individual who is the subject of the record, 
by stating the name, current address, date and place of birth, and, at 
your option, the social security number of the individual;
    (2) Your own identity, as required in paragraph (d) of this section;
    (3) That you are the parent or guardian of that individual, which 
you may prove by providing a copy of the individual's birth certificate 
showing your parentage or by providing a court order establishing your 
guardianship; and
    (4) That you are acting on behalf of that individual in making the 
request.

<R05>
Sec. 16.42  Responsibility for responding to requests for access to records.

    (a) In general. Except as stated in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of 
this section, the component that first receives a request for access to 
a record, and has possession of that record, is the component 
responsible for responding to the request. In determining which records 
are responsive to a request, a component ordinarily shall include only 
those records in its possession as of the date the component begins its 
search for them. If any other date is used, the component shall inform 
the requester of that date.
    (b) Authority to grant or deny requests. The head of a component, or 
the component head's designee, is authorized to grant or deny any 
request for access to a record of that component.
    (c) Consultations and referrals. When a component receives a request 
for access to a record in its possession, it shall determine whether 
another component, or another agency of the Federal Government, is 
better able to determine whether the record is exempt from access under 
the Privacy Act. If the receiving component determines that it is best 
able to process the record in response to the request, then it shall do 
so. If the receiving component determines that it is not best able to 
process the record, then it shall either:
    (1) Respond to the request regarding that record, after consulting 
with the component or agency best able to determine whether the record 
is exempt from access and with any other component or agency that has a 
substantial interest in it; or

[[Page 289]]

    (2) Refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding 
that record to the component best able to determine whether it is exempt 
from access, or to another agency that originated the record (but only 
if that agency is subject to the Privacy Act). Ordinarily, the component 
or agency that originated a record will be presumed to be best able to 
determine whether it is exempt from access.
    (d) Law enforcement information. Whenever a request is made for 
access to a record containing information that relates to an 
investigation of a possible violation of law and that was originated by 
another component or agency, the receiving component shall either refer 
the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that 
information to that other component or agency or shall consult with that 
other component or agency.
    (e) Classified information. Whenever a request is made for access to 
a record containing information that has been classified by or may be 
appropriate for classification by another component or agency under 
Executive Order 12958 or any other executive order concerning the 
classification of records, the receiving component shall refer the 
responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information 
to the component or agency that classified the information, should 
consider the information for classification, or has the primary interest 
in it, as appropriate. Whenever a record contains information that has 
been derivatively classified by a component because it contains 
information classified by another component or agency, the component 
shall refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding 
that information to the component or agency that classified the 
underlying information.
    (f) Notice of referral. Whenever a component refers all or any part 
of the responsibility for responding to a request to another component 
or agency, it ordinarily shall notify the requester of the referral and 
inform the requester of the name of each component or agency to which 
the request has been referred and of the part of the request that has 
been referred.
    (g) Timing of responses to consultations and referrals. All 
consultations and referrals shall be handled according to the date the 
Privacy Act access request was initially received by the first component 
or agency, not any later date.
    (h) Agreements regarding consultations and referrals. Components may 
make agreements with other components or agencies to eliminate the need 
for consultations or referrals for particular types of records.

[Order No. 2156-98, 63 FR 29600, June 1, 1998; 63 FR 34965, June 26, 
1998; 63 FR 51401, Sept. 25, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 16.43  Responses to requests for access to records.

    (a) Acknowledgements of requests. On receipt of a request, a 
component ordinarily shall send an acknowledgement letter to the 
requester which shall confirm the requester's agreement to pay fees 
under Sec. 16.41(c) and provide an assigned request number for further 
reference.
    (b) Grants of requests for access. Once a component makes a 
determination to grant a request for access in whole or in part, it 
shall notify the requester in writing. The component shall inform the 
requester in the notice of any fee charged under Sec. 16.49 and shall 
disclose records to the requester promptly on payment of any applicable 
fee. If a request is made in person, the component may disclose records 
to the requester directly, in a manner not unreasonably disruptive of 
its operations, on payment of any applicable fee and with a written 
record made of the grant of the request. If a requester is accompanied 
by another person, the requester shall be required to authorize in 
writing any discussion of the records in the presence of the other 
person.
    (c) Adverse determinations of requests for access. A component 
making an adverse determination denying a request for access in any 
respect shall notify the requester of that determination in writing. 
Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, consist of: A 
determination to withhold any requested record in whole or in part; a 
determination that a requested record does not exist or cannot be 
located; a determination that what has been requested is not a record 
subject to the Privacy

[[Page 290]]

Act; a determination on any disputed fee matter; and a denial of a 
request for expedited treatment. The notification letter shall be signed 
by the head of the component, or the component head's designee, and 
shall include:
    (1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the 
denial;
    (2) A brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial, including any 
Privacy Act exemption(s) applied by the component in denying the 
request; and
    (3) A statement that the denial may be appealed under Sec. 16.45(a) 
and a description of the requirements of Sec. 16.45(a).


<R05>
Sec. 16.44  Classified information.

    In processing a request for access to a record containing 
information that is classified under Executive Order 12958 or any other 
executive order, the originating component shall review the information 
to determine whether it should remain classified. Information determined 
to no longer require classification shall not be withheld from a 
requester on the basis of Exemption (k)(1) of the Privacy Act. On 
receipt of any appeal involving classified information, the Office of 
Information and Privacy shall take appropriate action to ensure 
compliance with part 17 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 16.45  Appeals from denials of requests for access to records.

    (a) Appeals. If you are dissatisfied with a component's response to 
your request for access to records, you may appeal an adverse 
determination denying your request in any respect to the Office of 
Information and Privacy, U.S. Department of Justice, Flag Building, 
Suite 570, Washington, DC 20530-0001. You must make your appeal in 
writing and it must be received by the Office of Information and Privacy 
within 60 days of the date of the letter denying your request. Your 
appeal letter may include as much or as little related information as 
you wish, as long as it clearly identifies the component determination 
(including the assigned request number, if known) that you are 
appealing. For the quickest possible handling, you should mark both your 
appeal letter and the envelope ``Privacy Act Appeal.'' Unless the 
Attorney General directs otherwise, a Director of the Office of 
Information and Privacy will act on behalf of the Attorney General on 
all appeals under this section, except that:
    (1) In the case of an adverse determination by the Deputy Attorney 
General or the Associate Attorney General, the Attorney General or the 
Attorney General's designee will act on the appeal;
    (2) An adverse determination by the Attorney General will be the 
final action of the Department; and
    (3) An appeal ordinarily will not be acted on if the request becomes 
a matter of litigation.
    (b) Responses to appeals. The decision on your appeal will be made 
in writing. A decision affirming an adverse determination in whole or in 
part will include a brief statement of the reason(s) for the affirmance, 
including any Privacy Act exemption applied, and will inform you of the 
Privacy Act provisions for court review of the decision. If the adverse 
determination is reversed or modified on appeal in whole or in part, you 
will be notified in a written decision and your request will be 
reprocessed in accordance with that appeal decision.
    (c) When appeal is required. If you wish to seek review by a court 
of any adverse determination or denial of a request, you must first 
appeal it under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 16.46  Requests for amendment or correction of records.

    (a) How made and addressed. Unless the record is not subject to 
amendment or correction as stated in paragraph (f) of this section, you 
may make a request for amendment or correction of a Department of 
Justice record about yourself by writing directly to the Department 
component that maintains the record, following the procedures in Sec. 
16.41. Your request should identify each particular record in question, 
state the amendment or correction that you want, and state why you 
believe that the record is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. 
You may submit any documentation that you think would be helpful. If you 
believe that the same record is in more than one system of records, you 
should state that and address your request to each

[[Page 291]]

component that maintains a system of records containing the record.
    (b) Component responses. Within ten working days of receiving your 
request for amendment or correction of records, a component shall send 
you a written acknowledgment of its receipt of your request, and it 
shall promptly notify you whether your request is granted or denied. If 
the component grants your request in whole or in part, it shall describe 
the amendment or correction made and shall advise you of your right to 
obtain a copy of the corrected or amended record, in disclosable form. 
If the component denies your request in whole or in part, it shall send 
you a letter signed by the head of the component, or the component 
head's designee, that shall state:
    (1) The reason(s) for the denial; and
    (2) The procedure for appeal of the denial under paragraph (c) of 
this section, including the name and business address of the official 
who will act on your appeal.
    (c) Appeals. You may appeal a denial of a request for amendment or 
correction to the Office of Information and Privacy in the same manner 
as a denial of a request for access to records (see Sec. 16.45) and the 
same procedures shall be followed. If your appeal is denied, you shall 
be advised of your right to file a Statement of Disagreement as 
described in paragraph (d) of this section and of your right under the 
Privacy Act for court review of the decision.
    (d) Statements of Disagreement. If your appeal under this section is 
denied in whole or in part, you have the right to file a Statement of 
Disagreement that states your reason(s) for disagreeing with the 
Department's denial of your request for amendment or correction. 
Statements of Disagreement must be concise, must clearly identify each 
part of any record that is disputed, and should be no longer than one 
typed page for each fact disputed. Your Statement of Disagreement must 
be sent to the component involved, which shall place it in the system of 
records in which the disputed record is maintained and shall mark the 
disputed record to indicate that a Statement of Disagreement has been 
filed and where in the system of records it may be found.
    (e) Notification of amendment/correction or disagreement. Within 30 
working days of the amendment or correction of a record, the component 
that maintains the record shall notify all persons, organizations, or 
agencies to which it previously disclosed the record, if an accounting 
of that disclosure was made, that the record has been amended or 
corrected. If an individual has filed a Statement of Disagreement, the 
component shall append a copy of it to the disputed record whenever the 
record is disclosed and may also append a concise statement of its 
reason(s) for denying the request to amend or correct the record.
    (f) Records not subject to amendment or correction. The following 
records are not subject to amendment or correction:
    (1) Transcripts of testimony given under oath or written statements 
made under oath;
    (2) Transcripts of grand jury proceedings, judicial proceedings, or 
quasi-judicial proceedings, which are the official record of those 
proceedings;
    (3) Presentence records that originated with the courts; and
    (4) Records in systems of records that have been exempted from 
amendment and correction under Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) or (k) by 
notice published in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 16.47  Requests for an accounting of record disclosures.

    (a) How made and addressed. Except where accountings of disclosures 
are not required to be kept (as stated in paragraph (b) of this 
section), you may make a request for an accounting of any disclosure 
that has been made by the Department to another person, organization, or 
agency of any record about you. This accounting contains the date, 
nature, and purpose of each disclosure, as well as the name and address 
of the person, organization, or agency to which the disclosure was made. 
Your request for an accounting should identify each particular record in 
question and should be made by writing directly to the Department 
component that maintains the record, following the procedures in Sec. 
16.41.

[[Page 292]]

    (b) Where accountings are not required. Components are not required 
to provide accountings to you where they relate to:
    (1) Disclosures for which accountings are not required to be kept--
in other words, disclosures that are made to employees within the agency 
and disclosures that are made under the FOIA;
    (2) Disclosures made to law enforcement agencies for authorized law 
enforcement activities in response to written requests from those law 
enforcement agencies specifying the law enforcement activities for which 
the disclosures are sought; or
    (3) Disclosures made from law enforcement systems of records that 
have been exempted from accounting requirements.
    (c) Appeals. You may appeal a denial of a request for an accounting 
to the Office of Information and Privacy in the same manner as a denial 
of a request for access to records (see Sec. 16.45) and the same 
procedures will be followed.


<R05>
Sec. 16.48  Preservation of records.

    Each component will preserve all correspondence pertaining to the 
requests that it receives under this subpart, as well as copies of all 
requested records, until disposition or destruction is authorized by 
title 44 of the United States Code or the National Archives and Records 
Administration's General Records Schedule 14. Records will not be 
disposed of while they are the subject of a pending request, appeal, or 
lawsuit under the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 16.49  Fees.

    Components shall charge fees for duplication of records under the 
Privacy Act in the same way in which they charge duplication fees under 
Sec. 16.11. No search or review fee may be charged for any record 
unless the record has been exempted from access under Exemptions (j)(2) 
or (k)(2) of the Privacy Act.


<R05>
Sec. 16.50  Notice of court-ordered and emergency disclosures.

    (a) Court-ordered disclosures. When a record pertaining to an 
individual is required to be disclosed by a court order, the component 
shall make reasonable efforts to provide notice of this to the 
individual. Notice shall be given within a reasonable time after the 
component's receipt of the order--except that in a case in which the 
order is not a matter of public record, the notice shall be given only 
after the order becomes public. This notice shall be mailed to the 
individual's last known address and shall contain a copy of the order 
and a description of the information disclosed. Notice shall not be 
given if disclosure is made from a criminal law enforcement system of 
records that has been exempted from the notice requirement.
    (b) Emergency disclosures. Upon disclosing a record pertaining to an 
individual made under compelling circumstances affecting health or 
safety, the component shall notify that individual of the disclosure. 
This notice shall be mailed to the individual's last known address and 
shall state the nature of the information disclosed; the person, 
organization, or agency to which it was disclosed; the date of 
disclosure; and the compelling circumstances justifying the disclosure.

<R05>
Sec. 16.51  Security of systems of records.

    (a) Each component shall establish administrative and physical 
controls to prevent unauthorized access to its systems of records, to 
prevent unauthorized disclosure of records, and to prevent physical 
damage to or destruction of records. The stringency of these controls 
shall correspond to the sensitivity of the records that the controls 
protect. At a minimum, each component's administrative and physical 
controls shall ensure that:
    (1) Records are protected from public view;
    (2) The area in which records are kept is supervised during business 
hours to prevent unauthorized persons from having access to them;
    (3) Records are inaccessible to unauthorized persons outside of 
business hours; and
    (4) Records are not disclosed to unauthorized persons or under 
unauthorized circumstances in either oral or written form.
    (b) Each component shall have procedures that restrict access to 
records to

[[Page 293]]

only those individuals within the Department who must have access to 
those records in order to perform their duties and that prevent 
inadvertent disclosure of records.

Sec. 16.52  Contracts for the operation of record systems.

    Any approved contract for the operation of a record system will 
contain the standard contract requirements issued by the General 
Services Administration to ensure compliance with the requirements of 
the Privacy Act for that record system. The contracting component will 
be responsible for ensuring that the contractor complies with these 
contract requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 16.53  Use and collection of social security numbers.

    Each component shall ensure that employees authorized to collect 
information are aware:
    (a) That individuals may not be denied any right, benefit, or 
privilege as a result of refusing to provide their social security 
numbers, unless the collection is authorized either by a statute or by a 
regulation issued prior to 1975; and
    (b) That individuals requested to provide their social security 
numbers must be informed of:
    (1) Whether providing social security numbers is mandatory or 
voluntary;
    (2) Any statutory or regulatory authority that authorizes the 
collection of social security numbers; and
    (3) The uses that will be made of the numbers.


<R05>
Sec. 16.54  Employee standards of conduct.

    Each component will inform its employees of the provisions of the 
Privacy Act, including the Act's civil liability and criminal penalty 
provisions. Unless otherwise permitted by law, an employee of the 
Department of Justice shall:
    (a) Collect from individuals only the information that is relevant 
and necessary to discharge the responsibilities of the Department;
    (b) Collect information about an individual directly from that 
individual whenever practicable;
    (c) Inform each individual from whom information is collected of:
    (1) The legal authority to collect the information and whether 
providing it is mandatory or voluntary;
    (2) The principal purpose for which the Department intends to use 
the information;
    (3) The routine uses the Department may make of the information; and
    (4) The effects on the individual, if any, of not providing the 
information;
    (d) Ensure that the component maintains no system of records without 
public notice and that it notifies appropriate Department officials of 
the existence or development of any system of records that is not the 
subject of a current or planned public notice;
    (e) Maintain all records that are used by the Department in making 
any determination about an individual with such accuracy, relevance, 
timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to ensure 
fairness to the individual in the determination;

FOIA, make reasonable efforts, prior to disseminating any record about 
an individual, to ensure that the record is accurate, relevant, timely, 
and complete;
    (g) Maintain no record describing how an individual exercises his or 
her First Amendment rights, unless it is expressly authorized by statute 
or by the individual about whom the record is maintained, or is 
pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement 
activity;
    (h) When required by the Act, maintain an accounting in the 
specified form of all disclosures of records by the Department to 
persons, organizations, or agencies;
    (i) Maintain and use records with care to prevent the unauthorized

Sec. 16.70  Exemption of the Office of the Attorney General System--limited access.

    (a) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c) 
(3) and (4); (d); (e) (1), (2) and (3), (e)(4) (G) and (H), (e)(5); and 
(g):
    (1) General Files System of the Office of the Attorney General 
(JUSTICE/OAG-001).


These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in the system 
is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j)(2), (k)(1), 
(k)(2), and (k)(5).
    (b) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because making available to a record 
subject the accounting of disclosures from records concerning him/her 
would reveal investigative interest on the part of the Department of 
Justice as well as the recipient agency. This would permit record 
subjects to impede the investigation, e.g., destroy evidence, intimidate 
potential witnesses, or flee the area to avoid inquiries or apprehension 
by law enforcement personnel.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) because this system is exempt from the 
access provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to subsections (j) and (k) 
of the Privacy Act.
    (3) From subsection (d) because the records contained in this system 
relate to official Federal investigations. Individual access to these 
records might compromise ongoing investigations, reveal confidential 
informants or constitute unwarranted invasions of the personal privacy 
of third parties who are involved in a certain investigation. Amendment 
of the records would interfere with ongoing criminal law enforcement 
proceedings and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring 
criminal investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.
    (4) From subsections (e) (1) and (5) because in the course of law 
enforcement investigations, information may occasionally be obtained or 
introduced the accuracy of which is unclear or which is not strictly 
relevant or necessary to a specific investigation. In the interests of 
effective law enforcement, it is appropriate to retain all information 
that may aid in establishing patterns of criminal activity. Moreover, it 
would impede the specific investigative process if it were necessary to 
assure the relevance, accuracy, timeliness and completeness of all 
information obtained.
    (5) From subsection (e)(2) because in a law enforcement 
investigation the requirement that information be collected to the 
greatest extent possible from the subject individual would present a 
serious impediment to law enforcement in that the subject of the 
investigation would be informed of the existence of the investigation 
and would therefore be able to avoid detection, apprehension, or legal 
obligations of duties.
    (6) From subsection (e)(3) because to comply with the requirements 
of this subsection during the course of an investigation could impede 
the information gathering process, thus hampering the investigation.
    (7) From subsections (e)(4) (G) and (H) because this system is 
exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to 
subsections (j) and (k) of the Privacy Act.
    (8) From subsection (g) because this system is exempt from the 
access and amendment provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to 
subsections (j) and (k) of the Privacy Act.

Sec. 16.71  Exemption of the Office of the Deputy Attorney General System--

limited access.

    (a) The following systems of records and exempt from 5 U.S.C. 
552a(d)(1) and (e)(1):
    (1) Presidential Appointee Candidate Records System (JUSTICE/DAG-
006).

[[Page 295]]

    (2) Presidential Appointee Records System (JUSTICE/DAG-007).
    (3) Special Candidates for Presidential Appointments Records System 
(JUSTICE/DAG-008).
    (4) Miscellaneous Attorney Personnel Records System (JUSTICE/DAG-
011).


These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in these 
systems is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5).
    (b) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (d)(1) because many persons are contacted who, 
without an assurance of anonymity, refuse to provide information 
concerning a candidate for a Presidential appointee or Department 
attorney position. Access could reveal the identity of the source of the 
information and constitute a breach of the promise of confidentiality on 
the part of the Department of Justice. Such breaches ultimately would 
restrict the free flow of information vital to a determination of a 
candidate's qualifications and suitability.
    (2) From subsection (e)(1) because in the collection of information 
for investigative and evaluative purposes, it is impossible to determine 
in advance what exact information may be of assistance in determining 
the qualifications and suitability of a candidate. Information which may 
appear irrelevant, when combined with other seemingly irrelevant 
information, can on occasion provide a composite picture of a candidate 
for a position which assists in determining whether that candidate 
should be nominated for appointment.
    (c) The following systems of records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 
552a(c)(3) and (4); (d); (e)(1), (2), (3) and (5); and (g):
    (1) Drug Enforcement Task Force Evaluation and Reporting System 
(JUSTICE/DAG-003).
    (2) General Files System of the Office of the Deputy Attorney 
General (JUSTICE/DAG-013).
    (d) In addition, the Drug Enforcement Task Force Evaluation and 
Reporting System is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(G) and (H). The 
exemptions for the Drug Enforcement Task Force Evaluation and Reporting 
System apply only to the extent that information is subject to exemption 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and (K)(2). The exemptions for the 
General Files System apply only to the extent that information is 
subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), (k)(2) and 
(k)(5).
    (e) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because making available to a record 
subject the accounting of disclosures from records concerning him/her 
could reveal investigative interest on the part of the Department of 
Justice, as well as the recipient agency. This would permit record 
subjects to impede the investigation, e.g., destroy evidence, intimidate 
potential witnesses, or flee the area to avoid inquiries or apprehension 
by law enforcement personnel. Further, making available to a record 
subject the accounting of disclosures could reveal the identity of a 
confidential source. In addition, release of an accounting of 
disclosures from the General Files System may reveal information that is 
properly classified pursuant to Executive Order 12356, and thereby cause 
damage to the national security.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) because these systems are exempt from the 
access provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to subsections (j) and (k) 
of the Privacy Act.
    (3) From subsection (d) because the records contained in these 
systems relate to official Federal investigations. Individual access to 
these records could compromise ongoing investigations, reveal 
confidential informants and/or sensitive investigative techniques used 
in particular investigations, or constitute unwarranted invasions of the 
personal privacy of third parties who are involved in a certain 
investigation. In addition, release of records from the General Files 
System may reveal information that is properly classified pursuant to 
Executive Order 12356, and thereby cause damage to the national 
security. Amendment of the records in either of these systems would 
interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings and impose an 
impossible administrative burden by requiring law

[[Page 296]]

enforcement investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.
    (4) From subsections (e)(1) and (e)(5) because in the course of law 
enforcement investigations information may occasionally be obtained or 
introduced the accuracy of which is unclear or which is not strictly 
relevant or necessary to a specific investigation. In the interests of 
effective law enforcement, it is appropriate to retain all information 
that may aid in establishing patterns of criminal activity. Moreover, it 
would impede any investigative process, whether civil or criminal, if it 
were necessary to assure the relevance, accuracy, timeliness and 
completeness of all information obtained.
    (5) From subsection (e)(2) because in a law enforcement 
investigation the requirement that information be collected to the 
greatest extent possible from the subject individual would present a 
serious impediment to law enforcement in that the subject of the 
investigation would be informed of the existence of the investigation 
and may therefore be able to avoid detection, apprehension, or legal 
obligations or duties.
    (6) From subsection (e)(3) because to comply with the requirements 
of this subsection during the course of an investigation could impede 
the information gathering process, thus hampering the investigation.
    (7) From subsections (e)(4) (G) and (H) because no access to these 
records is available under subsection (d) of the Privacy Act. (This 
exemption applies only to the Drug Enforcement Task Force Evaluation and 
Reporting System.)
    (8) From subsection (g) because these systems of records are exempt 
from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to 
subsections (j) and (k) of the Privacy Act.

limited access.

    (a) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c) 
(3) and (4); (d); (e)(1), (2), (3) and (5); and (g):
    (1) General Files System of the Office of the Associate Attorney

security.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) because this system is exempt from the 
access provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to subsections (j)(2), 
(k)(1), (k)(2) and (k)(5) of the Privacy Act.
    (3) From subsection (d) because the records contained in this system 
relate to official Federal investigations. Individual access to these 
records could compromise ongoing investigations, reveal confidential 
informants and/or sensitive investigative techniques used in particular 
investigations, or constitute unwarranted invasions of the personal 
privacy of third parties who are involved in a certain investigation. In 
addition, release of these records may reveal information that is 
properly classified pursuant to Executive Order 12356, and thereby cause 
damage to the national security. Amendment of the records in this system 
would interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings and impose an 
impossible administrative burden by requiring law enforcement 
investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.
    (4) From subsections (e)(1) and (e)(5) because in the course of law 
enforcement investigations information may occasionally be obtained or

necessary to a specific investigation. In the interests of effective law 
enforcement, it is appropriate to retain all information that may aid in 
establishing patterns of criminal activity. Moreover, it would impede 
any investigative process, whether civil or criminal, if it were

    (6) From subsection (e)(3) because to comply with the requirements 
of this subsection during the course of an investigation could impede 
the information gathering process, thus hampering the investigation.
    (7) From subsection (g) because this system of records is exempt 
from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to 
subsections (j)(2), (k)(1), (k)(2) and (k)(5) of the Privacy Act.

system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), (k)(2) 
and (k)(5).
    (b) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsections (d)(1), (2), (3), and (4) to the extent that 
information in this record system relates to official Federal 
investigations and matters of law enforcement. Individual access to 
these records might compromise ongoing investigations, reveal 
confidential informants or constitute unwarranted invasions of the 
personal privacy of third parties who are involved in a certain 
investigation. Amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing 
criminal law enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible

These exemptions apply to the extent that information in this system is 
subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5).

These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in those 
systems is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), (k)(1) 
and (k)(2).
    (b) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because release of the disclosure 
accounting would put the target of a surveillance or investigation on 
notice of the investigation or surveillance and would thereby seriously 
hinder authorized United States intelligence activities.
    (2) From subsections (c)(4), (d), (e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), (f) and (g) 
because these provisions contemplate individual access to records and 
such access would compromise ongoing surveillances or investigations and 
reveal the sources and methods of an investigation.
    (3) From subsection (e)(2) because, although this office does not 
conduct investigations, the collection efforts of agencies that supply 
information to this office would be thwarted if the agency were required 
to collect information with the subject's knowledge.
    (4) From subsections (e)(3) and (e)(8) because disclosure and notice 
would provide the subject with substantial information which could 
impede of compromise an investigation. For example, an investigatory 
subject could, once made aware that an investigation was ongoing, alter 
his manner of engaging in intelligence or terrorist activities in order 
to avoid detection.

system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j)(2), (k)(1) 
and (k)(2). Where compliance would not appear to interfere with or 
adversely affect the law enforcement process, and/or where it may be 
appropriate to permit individuals to contest the accuracy of the 
information collected, e.g., public source materials, the applicable 
exemption may be waived, either partially or totally, by the Office of 
the Inspector General (OIG).
    (b) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because release of disclosure accounting 
could alert the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential 
criminal, civil, or regulatory violation to the existence of the 
investigation and the fact that they are subjects of the investigation, 
and reveal investigative interest by not only the OIG, but also by the 
recipient agency. Since release of such information to the subjects of 
an investigation would provide them with significant information 
concerning the nature of the investigation, release could result in the 
destruction of documentary evidence, improper influencing of witnesses, 
endangerment of the physical safety of confidential sources, witnesses, 
and law enforcement personnel, the fabrication of testimony, flight of 
the subject from the area, and other activities that could impede or 
compromise the investigation. In addition, accounting for each 
disclosure could result in the release of properly classified 
information which would compromise the national defense or disrupt 
foreign policy.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) because this system is exempt from the 
access provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to subsections (j) and (k) 
of the Privacy Act.

[[Page 301]]

    (3) From the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d) 
because access to the records contained in this system of records could 
inform the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential 
criminal, civil, or regulatory violation, of the existence of that 
investigation; of the nature and scope of the information and evidence 
obtained as to his activities; of the identity of confidential sources, 
witnesses, and law enforcement personnel, and of information that may 
enable the subject to avoid detection or apprehension. These factors 
would present a serious impediment to effective law enforcement where 
they prevent the successful completion of the investigation, endanger 
the physical safety of confidential sources, witnesses, and law 
enforcement personnel, and/or lead to the improper influencing of 
witnesses, the destruction of evidence, or the fabrication of testimony. 
In addition, granting access to such information could disclose 
security-sensitive or confidential business information or information 
that would constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of 
third parties. Finally, access to the records could result in the 
release of properly classified information which would compromise the 
national defense or disrupt foreign policy. Amendment of the records 
would interfere with ongoing investigations and law enforcement 
activities and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring 
investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.
    (4) From subsection (e)(1) because the application of this provision 
could impair investigations and interfere with the law enforcement 
responsibilities of the OIG for the following reasons:
    (i) It is not possible to detect relevance or necessity of specific 
information in the early stages of a civil, criminal or other law 
enforcement investigation, case, or matter, including investigations in 
which use is made of properly classified information. Relevance and 
necessity are questions of judgment and timing, and it is only after the 
information is evaluated that the relevance and necessity of such 
information can be established.
    (ii) During the course of any investigation, the OIG may obtain 
information concerning actual or potential violations of laws other than 
those within the scope of its jurisdiction. In the interest of effective 
law enforcement, the OIG should retain this information, as it may aid 
in establishing patterns of criminal activity, and can provide valuable 
leads for Federal and other law enforcement agencies.
    (iii) In interviewing individuals or obtaining other forms of 
evidence during an investigation, information may be supplied to an 
investigator which relates to matters incidental to the primary purpose 
of the investigation but which may relate also to matters under the 
investigative jurisdiction of another agency. Such information cannot 
readily be segregated.
    (5) From subsection (e)(2) because, in some instances, the 
application of this provision would present a serious impediment to law 
enforcement for the following reasons:
    (i) The subject of an investigation would be placed on notice as to 
the existence of an investigation and would therefore be able to avoid 
detection or apprehension, to improperly influence witnesses, to destroy 
evidence, or to fabricate testimony.
    (ii) In certain circumstances the subject of an investigation cannot 
be required to provide information to investigators, and information 
relating to a subject's illegal acts, violations of rules of conduct, or 
any other misconduct must be obtained from other sources.
    (iii) In any investigation it is necessary to obtain evidence from a 
variety of sources other than the subject of the investigation in order 
to verify the evidence necessary for successful litigation.
    (6) From subsection (e)(3) because the application of this provision 
would provide the subject of an investigation with substantial 
information which could impede or compromise the investigation. 
Providing such notice to a subject of an investigation could interfere 
with an undercover investigation by revealing its existence, and could 
endanger the physical safety of confidential sources, witnesses, and 
investigators by revealing their identities.

[[Page 302]]

    (7) From subsection (e)(5) because the application of this provision 
would prevent the collection of any data not shown to be accurate, 
relevant, timely, and complete at the moment it is collected. In the 
collection of information for law enforcement purposes, it is impossible 
to determine in advance what information is accurate, relevant, timely, 
and complete. Material which may seem unrelated, irrelevant, or 
incomplete when collected may take on added meaning or significance as 
an investigation progresses. The restrictions of this provision could 
interfere with the preparation of a complete investigative report, and 
thereby impede effective law enforcement.
    (8) From subsection (e)(8) because the application of this provision 
could prematurely reveal an ongoing criminal investigation to the 
subject of the investigation, and could reveal investigative techniques, 
procedures, or evidence.
    (9) From subsection (g) to the extent that this system is exempt 
from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to 
subsections (j)(2) and (k)(1) and (k)(2) of the Privacy Act.
    (c) The following system of records is exempted from 5 U.S.C. 
552a(d).
    (1) Office of the Inspector General, Freedom of Information/Privacy 
Acts (FOI/PA) Records (JUSTICE/OIG-003).


This exemption applies only to the extent that information in this 
system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j)(2), (k)(1), 
and (k)(2). To the extent that information in a record pertaining to an 
individual does not relate to official Federal investigations and law 
enforcement matters, the exemption does not apply. In addition, where 
compliance would not appear to interfere with or adversely affect the 
overall law enforcement process, the applicable exemption may be waived 
by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG).
    (d) Exemption from subsection (d) is justified for the following 
reasons:
    (1) From the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d) 
because access to the records contained in this system of records could 
inform the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential 
criminal, civil, or regulatory violation of the existence of that 
investigation; of the nature and scope of the information and evidence 
obtained as to his activities; of the identity of confidential sources, 
witnesses, and law enforcement personnel; and of information that may 
enable the subject to avoid detection or apprehension. These factors 
would present a serious impediment to effective law enforcement where 
they prevent the successful completion of the investigation, endanger 
the physical safety of confidential sources, witnesses, and law 
enforcement personnel, and/or lead to the improper influencing of 
witnesses, the destruction of evidence, or the fabrication of testimony. 
In addition, granting access to such information could disclose 
security-sensitive or confidential business information or information 
that would constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of 
third parties. Finally, access to the records could result in the 
release of properly classified information which would compromise the 
national defense or disrupt foreign policy. Amendment of the records 
would interfere with ongoing investigations and law enforcement 
activities and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring 
investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.

<R05>
Sec. 16.76  Exemption of Justice Management Division.

    (a) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(d):
    (1) Controlled Substances Act Nonpublic Records (JUSTICE/JMD-002).


This exemption applies only to the extent that information in this 
system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).
    (b) Exemption from subsection (d) is justified for the following 
reasons:
    (1) Access to and use of the nonpublic records maintained in this 
system are restricted by law. Section 3607(b) of Title 18 U.S.C. 
(enacted as part of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98-473, 
Chapter II) provides that the sole purpose of these records shall be for 
use by the courts in determining

[[Page 303]]

whether a person found guilty of violating section 404 of the Controlled 
Substances Act qualifies:
    (i) For the disposition available under 18 U.S.C. 3607(a) to persons 
with no prior conviction under a Federal or State law relating to 
controlled substances, or
    (ii) For an order, under 18 U.S.C. 3607(c), expunging all official 
records (except the nonpublic records to be retained by the Department 
of Justice) of the arrest and any subsequent criminal proceedings 
relating to the offense.
    (2) Information in this system consists of arrest records, including 
those of co-defendants. The records include reports of informants and 
investigations. Therefore, access could disclose investigative 
techniques, reveal the identity of confidential sources, and invade the 
privacy of third parties.
    (c) The following system of records is exempted from 5 U.S.C. 
552a(c)(3) and (4); (d)(1), (2), (3), and (4); (e)(1), (2), (3), (5), 
and (8); and (g): Federal Bureau of Investigation Whistleblower Case 
Files (Justice/JMD-023). These exemptions apply only to the extent that 
information in a record contained within this system is subject to 
exemptions pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and (k).
    (d) Exemption from the particular subsections is justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) Subsection (c)(3). To provide the subject with an accounting of 
disclosures of records in this system could inform that individual of 
the existence, nature, or scope of an actual or potential law 
enforcement or counterintelligence investigation, and thereby seriously 
impede law enforcement or counterintelligence efforts by permitting the 
record subject and other persons to whom he might disclose the records 
to avoid criminal penalties, civil remedies, or counterintelligence 
measures.
    (2) Subsection (c)(4). This subsection is inapplicable to the extent 
that an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d).
    (3) Subsection (d)(1). Information within this record system could 
relate to official federal investigations and matters of law 
enforcement. Individual access to these records could compromise ongoing 
investigations, reveal confidential informants and/or sensitive 
investigative techniques used in particular investigations, or 
constitute unwarranted invasions of the personal privacy of third 
parties who are involved in a certain investigation. Disclosure may also 
reveal information relating to actual or potential law enforcement 
investigations. Disclosure of classified national security information 
would cause damage to the national security of the United States.
    (4) Subsection (d)(2). Amendment of these records could interfere 
with ongoing criminal or civil law enforcement proceedings and impose an 
impossible administrative burden by requiring investigations to be 
continuously reinvestigated.
    (5) Subsections (d)(3) and (4). These subsections are inapplicable 
to the extent exemption is claimed from (d)(1) and (2).
    (6) Subsection (e)(1). It is often impossible to determine in 
advance if investigatory information contained in this system is 
accurate, relevant, timely and complete, but, in the interests of 
effective law enforcement and counterintelligence, it is necessary to 
retain this information to aid in establishing patterns of activity and 
provide investigative leads.
    (7) Subsection (e)(2). To collect information from the subject 
individual could serve to notify the subject individual that he or she 
is the subject of a criminal investigation and thereby present a serious 
impediment to such investigations.
    (8) Subsection (e)(3). To inform individuals as required by this 
subsection could reveal the existence of a criminal investigation and 
compromise investigative efforts.
    (9) Subsection (e)(5). It is often impossible to determine in 
advance if investigatory information contained in this system is 
accurate, relevant, timely and complete, but, in the interests of 
effective law enforcement and counterintelligence, it is necessary to 
retain this information to aid in establishing patterns of activity and 
provide investigative leads.
    (10) Subsection (e)(8). To serve notice could give persons 
sufficient warning to evade investigative efforts.

[[Page 304]]

    (11) Subsection (g). This subsection is inapplicable to the extent 
that the system is exempt from other specific subsections of the Privacy 
Act.

Sec. 16.77  Exemption of U.S. Trustee Program System--limited access.

    (a) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a (c) 
(3) and (4); (d); (e) (1), (2) and (3), (e)(4) (G) and (H), (e) (5) and 
(8); (f) and (g):
    (1) U.S. Trustee Program Case Referral System, JUSTICE/UST-004.


These exemptions apply to the extent that information in this system is 
subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and (k)(2).
    (b) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of the disclosure 
accounting would permit the subject of an investigation to obtain 
valuable information concerning the nature of that investigation. This 
would permit record subjects to impede the investigation, e.g., destroy 
evidence, intimidate potential witnesses, or flee the area to avoid 
inquiries or apprehension by law enforcement personnel.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) since an exemption being claimed for 
subsection (d) makes this subsection inapplicable.
    (3) From subsection (d) because access to the records contained in 
this system might compromise ongoing investigations, reveal confidential 
informants, or constitute unwarranted invasions of the personal privacy 
of third parties who are involved in a certain investigation. Amendment 
of the records would interfere with ongoing criminal law enforcement 
proceedings and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring 
criminal investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.
    (4) From subsections (e)(1) and (e)(5) because in the course of law 
enforcement investigations, information may occasionally be obtained or 
introduced the accuracy of which is unclear or which is not strictly 
relevant or necessary to a specific investigation. In the interest of 
effective law enforcement, it is appropriate to retain all information 
that may aid in establishing patterns of criminal activity. Moreover, it 
would impede the specific investigative process if it were necessary to 
assure the relevance, accuracy, timeliness, and completeness of all 
information obtained.
    (5) From subsection (e)(2) because in a criminal investigation the 
requirement that information be collected to the greatest extent 
possible from the subject individual would present a serious impediment 
to law enforcement because the subject of the investigation would be 
placed on notice as to the existence of the investigation and would 
therefore be able to avoid detection or apprehension, to influence 
witnesses improperly, to destroy evidence, or to fabricate testimony.
    (6) From subsection (e)(3) because the requirement that individuals 
supplying information be provided with a form stating the requirements 
of subsection (e)(3) would constitute a serious impediment to law 
enforcement in that it would compromise the existence of a confidential 
investigation or reveal the identity of witnesses or confidential 
informants.
    (7) From subsections (e)(4) (G) and (H) because this system of 
records is exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d) pursuant 
to subsections (j) and (k).
    (8) From subsection (e)(8) because the individual notice requirement 
of this subsection could present a serious impediment to law enforcement 
in that this could interfere with the U.S. Attorney's ability to issue 
subpoenas.
    (9) From subsections (f) and (g) because this system has been 
exempted from the access provisions of subsection (d).

    (a) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 
552a(c)(3) and (d).

[[Page 305]]

    (1) Central Index File and Associated Records, JUSTICE/OSC-001.


These exemptions apply to the extent that information in this system is 
subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2).
    (b) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of the disclosure 
accounting would permit the subject of an investigation to obtain 
valuable information concerning the nature of that investigation. This 
would permit record subjects to impede the investigation, e.g., destroy 
evidence, intimidate potential witnesses, or flee the area to avoid 
inquiries.
    (2) From subsection (d) because access to the records might 
compromise ongoing investigations, reveal confidential informants, or 
constitute unwarranted invasions of the personal privacy of third 
parties who are involved in a certain investigation.

Sec. 16.79  Exemption of Pardon Attorney System.

    (a) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a, 
subsections (c)(3), (c)(4), (d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3), (d)(4), and (e)(5): 
Executive Clemency Case Files/Executive Clemency Tracking System 
(JUSTICE/OPA-001). These exemptions apply only to the extent that 
information in this system of records is subject to exemption pursuant 
to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).
    (b) Exemption from the particular subsections is justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because:
    (i) The purpose of the creation and maintenance of the Executive 
Clemency Case Files/Executive Clemency Tracking System (JUSTICE/OPA-001) 
is to enable the Justice Department to prepare reports and 
recommendations to the President for his ultimate decisions on clemency 
matters, which are committed to exclusive discretion of the President 
pursuant to Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution.
    (ii) Release of the disclosure accounting, for disclosures pursuant 
to the routine uses published for this system, would permit the 
requester to obtain valuable information concerning the nature and scope 
of a clemency investigation, invade the right of candid and confidential 
communications among officials concerned with making recommendations to 
the President in clemency matters, and disclose the identity of persons 
who furnished information to the Government under an express or implied 
promise that their identities would be held in confidence.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) because the exemption from subsections 
(d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3), and (d)(4) will make notification of disputes 
inapplicable.
    (3) From subsections (d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3), and (d)(4) is justified 
for the reasons stated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (4) From subsection (e)(5) is justified for the reasons stated in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

Sec. 16.80  Exemption of Office of Professional Responsibility System--

limited access.

    (a) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 
552a(c)(3) and (4), (d), (e)(1), (2) and (3), (e)(4)(G) and (H), (e)(5) 
and (8), (f) and (g):
    (1) Office of Professional Responsibility Record Index (JUSTICE/OPR-
001).


These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in the system 
is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), (k)(2), 
and (k)(5).
    (b) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because release of the disclosure 
accounting would enable the subject of an investigation to gain 
information concerning the existence, nature and scope of the 
investigation and seriously hamper law enforcement efforts.
    (2) From subsections (c)(4), (d), (e)(4)(G) and (H), (f) and (g) 
because these provisions concern individual access to records and such 
access might compromise ongoing investigations, reveal confidential 
informants and constitute unwarranted invasions of the personal privacy 
of third persons who

[[Page 306]]

provide information in connection with a particular investigation.
    (3) From subsections (e)(1) and (5) because the collection of 
information during an investigation necessarily involves material 
pertaining to other persons or events which is appropriate in a thorough 
investigation, even though portions thereof are not ultimately connected 
to the person or event subject to the final action or recommendation of 
the Office of Professional Responsibility.
    (4) From subsection (e)(2) because collecting the information from 
the subject would thwart the investigation by placing the subject on 
notice of the investigation.
    (5) From subsections (e)(3) and (e)(8) because disclosure and notice 
would provide the subject with substantial information which could 
impede or compromise the investigation. For example, an investigatory 
subject occupying a supervisory position could, once made aware that a 
misconduct investigation was ongoing, put undue pressure on subordinates 
so as to preclude their cooperation with investigators.
    (c) The following system of records is exempted from 5 U.S.C. 
552a(d).
    (1) Freedom of Information/Privacy Act (FOI/PA) Records (JUSTICE/
OPR-002).
    This exemption applies only to the extent that information in this 
system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), 
and (k)(2). To the extent that information in a record pertaining to an 
individual does not relate to national defense or foreign policy, 
official Federal investigations and/or law enforcement matters, the 
exemption does not apply. In addition, where compliance would not appear 
to interfere with or adversely affect the overall law enforcement 
process, the applicable exemption may be waived by OPR.
    (d) Exemption from subsection (d) is justified for the following 
reasons:
    (1) From the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d) 
because access to the records contained in this system of records could 
inform the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential 
criminal, civil, or regulatory violation of the existence of that 
investigation; of the nature and scope of the information and evidence 
obtained as to his activities; of the identity of confidential sources, 
witnesses, and law enforcement personnel; and of information that may 
enable the subject to avoid detection or apprehension. These factors 
would present a serious impediment to effective law enforcement where 
they prevent the successful completion of the investigation, endanger 
the physical safety of confidential sources, witnesses, and law 
enforcement personnel, and/or lead to the improper influencing of 
witnesses, the destruction of evidence, or the fabrication of testimony. 
In addition, granting access to such information could disclose 
security-sensitive or confidential business information or information 
that would constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of 
third parties. Finally, access to the records could result in the 
release of properly classified information which would compromise the 
national defense or disrupt foreign policy. Amendment of the records 
would interfere with ongoing investigations and law enforcement 
activities and impose an enormous administrative burden by requiring 
investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.

Sec. 16.81  Exemption of United States Attorneys Systems--limited access.

    (a) The following systems of records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 
552a(c) (3) and (4), (d), (e) (1), (2) and (3), (e)(4) (G) and (H), (e) 
(5) and (8), (f), and (g):
    (1) Citizen Complaint Files (JUSTICE/USA-003).

    (3) Consumer Complaints (JUSTICE/USA-006).
    (4) Criminal Case Files (JUSTICE/USA-007).

    (8) United States Attorney, District of Columbia Superior Court 
Division, Criminal Files (JUSTICE/USA-013).
    (9) Pre-trial Diversion Program Files (JUSTICE/USA-014).


These exemptions apply to the extent that information in these systems 
is subject to exemption pursuant to U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), (k)(1) and 
(k)(2).
    (b) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of the disclosure 
accounting, for disclosures pursuant to the routine uses published for 
these systems, would permit the subject of a criminal investigation and/
or civil case or matter under investigation, litigation, regulatory or 
administrative review or action, to obtain valuable information 
concerning the nature of that investigation, case or matter and present 
a serious impediment to law enforcement or civil legal activities.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) since an exemption is being claimed for 
subsection (d), this subsection will not be applicable.
    (3) From subsection (d) because access to the records contained in 
these systems would inform the subject of criminal investigation and/or 
civil investigation, matter or case of the existence of that 
investigation, provide the subject of the investigation with information 
that might enable him to avoid detection, apprehension or legal 
obligations, and present a serious impediment to law enforcement and 
other civil remedies.
    (4) From subsection (e)(1) because in the course of criminal 
investigations and/or civil investigations, cases or matters, the U.S. 
Attorneys often obtain information concerning the violation of laws or 
civil obligations other than those relating to an active case or matter. 
In the interests of effective law enforcement and civil litigation, it 
is necessary that the U.S. Attorneys retain this information since it 
can aid in establishing patterns of activity and provide valuable leads 
for other agencies and future cases that may be brought within the U.S. 
Attorneys' offices.
    (5) From subsection (e)(2) because in a criminal investigation the 
requirement that information be collected to the greatest extent 
possible from the subject individual would present a serious impediment 
to law enforcement in that the subject of the investigation would be 
placed on notice of the existence of the investigation and would 
therefore be able to avoid detection, apprehension or legal obligations 
and duties.
    (6) From subsection (e)(3) because the requirement that individuals 
supplying information be provided with a form stating the requirements 
of subsection (e)(3) would constitute a serious impediment to law 
enforcement in that it could compromise the existence of a confidential 
investigation, reveal the identity of confidential sources of 
information and endanger the life and physical safety of confidential 
informants.
    (7) From subsections (e)(4) (G) and (H) because these systems of 
records are exempt from individual access pursuant to subsections (j) 
and (k) of the Privacy Act of 1974.
    (8) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection of information 
for law enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance 
what information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. With the 
passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may 
acquire new significance as further investigation brings new details to 
light and the accuracy of such information can only be determined in a 
court of law. The restrictions of subsection (e)(5) would restrict the 
ability of trained investigators and intelligence analysts to exercise 
their judgment in reporting on investigations and impede the development 
of intelligence necessary for effective law enforcement.
    (9) From subsection (e)(8) because the individual notice 
requirements of subsection (e)(8) could present a serious impediment to 
law enforcement as this could interfere with the United States 
Attorneys' ability to issue subpoenas and could reveal investigative 
techniques and procedures.
    (10) From subsection (f) because these systems of records have been 
exempted from the access provisions of subsection (d).

[[Page 308]]

    (11) From subsection (g) because these systems of records are 
compiled for law enforcement purposes and have been exempted from the 
access provisions of subsections (d) and (f).
    (c) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c) 
(3) and (4), (d), (e) (1), (2) and (3), (e)(4) (G) and (H), (e) (5) and 
(8), (f), and (g):
    (1) Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act Files (JUSTICE/USA-008)


These exemptions apply to the extent that information in this system is 
subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), (k)(1) and (k)(2).
    (d) Because this system contains Department of Justice civil and 
criminal law enforcement, investigatory records, exemptions from the 
particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of the disclosure 
accounting would permit the subject of a criminal investigation and/or 
civil case or matter under investigation, in litigation, or under 
regulatory or administrative review or action to obtain valuable 
information concerning the nature of that investigation, case or matter, 
and present a serious impediment to law enforcement or civil legal 
activities.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) because an exemption is being claimed for 
subsection (d) of the Act (Access to Records), rendering this subsection 
inapplicable to the extent that this system of records is exempted from 
subsection (d).
    (3) From subsection (d) because access to the records contained in 
these systems would inform the subject of a criminal or civil 
investigation, matter or case of the existence of such, and provide the 
subject with information that might enable him to avoid detection, 
apprehension or legal obligations, and present a serious impediment to 
law enforcement and other civil remedies. Amendment of the records would 
interfere with ongoing criminal law enforcement proceedings and impose 
an impossible administrative burden by requiring criminal investigations 
to be continuously reinvestigated.
    (4) From subsection (e)(1) because in the course of criminal 
investigations and/or civil investigations, cases or matters, the U.S. 
Attorneys often obtain information concerning the violation of laws or 
civil obligations other than those relating to an active case or matter. 
In the interests of effective law enforcement and civil litigation, it 
is necessary that the U.S. Attorneys retain this information since it 
can aid in establishing patterns of activity and provide valuable leads 
for other agencies and future cases that may be brought within the U.S. 
Attorneys' offices.
    (5) From subsection (e)(2) because to collect information to the 
greatest extent possible from the subject individual of a criminal 
investigation or prosecution would present a serious impediment to law 
enforcement in that the subject of the investigation would be placed on 
notice of the existence of the investigation and would therefore be able 
to avoid detection, apprehension, or legal obligations and duties.
    (6) From subsection (e)(3) because to provide individuals supplying 
information with a form stating the requirements of subsection (e)(3) 
would constitute a serious impediment to law enforcement in that it 
could compromise the existence of a confidential investigation, reveal 
the identity of confidential sources of information, and endanger the 
life and physical safety of confidential informants.
    (7) From subsections (e)(4) (G) and (H) because this system of 
records is exempt from the individual access provisions of subsection 
(d) and the rules provisions of subsection (f).
    (8) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection of information 
for law enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance 
what information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. With the 
passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may 
acquire new significance as further investigation brings new details to 
light and the accuracy of such information can only be determined in a 
court of law. The restrictions of subsection (e)(5) would inhibit the 
ability of trained investigator and intelligence analysts to exercise 
their judgment in reporting on investigations and impede the development 
of intelligence necessary for effective law enforcement.

[[Page 309]]

    (9) From subsection (e)(8) because the individual notice 
requirements of subsection (e)(8) could present a serious impediment to 
law enforcement as this could interfere with the U.S. Attorneys' ability 
to issue subpoenas and could reveal investigative techniques and 
procedures.
    (10) From subsection (f) because this system has been exempted from 
the individual access provisions of subsection (d).
    (11) From subsection (g) because the records in this system are 
generally compiled for law enforcement purposes and are exempt from the 
access provisions of subsections (d) and (f), rendering subsection (g) 
inapplicable.
    (e) The following systems of records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 
552a(d)(1) and (e)(1):
    (1) Assistant U.S. Attorneys Applicant Records System (JUSTICE/USA-
016).
    (2) Appointed Assistant U.S. Attorneys Personnel System (JUSTICE/
USA-017).


These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in these 
systems is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5).
    (f) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (d)(1) because many persons are contacted who, 
without an assurance of anonymity, refuse to provide information 
concerning a candidate for an Assistant U.S. Attorney position. Access 
could reveal the identity of the source of the information and 
constitute a breach of the promise of confidentiality on the part of the 
Department of Justice. Such breaches ultimately would restrict the free 
flow of information vital to a determination of a candidate's 
qualifications and suitability.
    (2) From subsection (e)(1) because in the collection of information 
for investigative and evaluative purposes, it is impossible to determine 
in advance what exact information may be of assistance in determining 
the qualifications and suitability of a candidate. Information which may 
appear irrelevant, when combined with other seemingly irrelevant 
information, can on occasion provide a composite picture of a candidate 
for a position which assists in determining whether that candidate 
should be nominated for appointment.
    (g) The Giglio Impeachment Files (JUSTICE/USA-018) system of records 
is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a subsections (c)(4), (e)(2), (e)(5), and (g) 
of the Privacy Act, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), and exempt from 
subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f), pursuant to 
5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and (k)(2). These exemptions apply to the extent 
that information in this system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 
U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and (k)(2).
    (h) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3); because an exemption is being claimed 
for subsection (d), this subsection will not be applicable.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4); because an exemption is being claimed 
for subsection (d), this subsection will not be applicable.
    (3) From subsection (d); because access to the records contained in 
these systems is not necessary or may impede an ongoing investigation. 
Most information in the records is derivative from the subject's 
employing agency files, and individual access will be through the 
employing agency's files. Additionally, other information in the records 
may be related to allegations against an agent or witness that are 
currently being investigated. Providing access to this information would 
impede the ongoing investigation.
    (4) From subsection (e)(1); because in the interest of effective law 
enforcement and criminal prosecution, Giglio records will be retained 
because they could later be relevant in a different case; however, this 
relevance cannot be determined in advance.
    (5) From subsection (e)(2); because the nature of the records in 
this system, which are used to impeach or demonstrate bias of a witness, 
requires that the information be collected from others.
    (6) From subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H); because this system of 
records is exempt from individual access pursuant to subsections (j) and 
(k) of the Privacy Act of 1974.

[[Page 310]]

    (7) From subsection (e)(5); because the information in these records 
is not being used to make a determination about the subject of the 
records. According to constitutional principles of fairness articulated 
by the Supreme Court in United States v. Giglio, the records are 
required to be disclosed to criminal defendants to ensure fairness of 
criminal proceedings.
    (8) From subsection (f); because records in this system have been 
exempted from the access provisions of subsection (d).
    (9) From subsection (g); because records in this system are compiled 
for law enforcement purposes and have been exempted from the access 
provisions of subsections (d) and (f).
    (i) Consistent with the legislative purpose of the Privacy Act of 
1974, the Executive Office for United States Attorneys will grant access 
to nonexempt material in records which are maintained by the U.S. 
Attorneys. Disclosure will be governed by the Department's Privacy 
regulations, but will be limited to the extent that the identity of 
confidential sources will not be compromised; subjects of an 
investigation of an actual or potential criminal, civil or regulatory 
violation will not be alerted to the investigation; the physical safety 
of witnesses, informants and law enforcement personnel will not be 
endangered, the privacy of third parties will not be violated; and that 
the disclosure would not otherwise impede effective law enforcement. 
Whenever possible, information of the above nature will be deleted from 
the requested documents and the balance made available. The controlling 
principle behind this limited access is to allow disclosures except 
those indicated above. The decisions to release information from these 
systems will be made on a case-by-case basis.

Sec. 16.82  Exemption of the National Drug Intelligence Center Data Base--

limited access.

    (a) The following system of records is exempted pursuant to the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) from subsections (c) (3) and (4); (d); 
(e) (1), (2), and (3); (e)(4)(I); (e) (5) and (8); and (g) of 5 U.S.C. 
552a. In addition, the following system of records is exempted pursuant 
to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a (k)(1) and (k)(2) from subsections 
(c)(3), (d), and (e)(1) and (e)(4)(I) of 5 U.S.C. 552a:
    (1) National Drug Intelligence Center Data Base (JUSTICE/NDIC-001).
    (2) [Reserved]
    (b) These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in 
this system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), 
(k)(1), and (k)(2). Where compliance would not appear to interfere with 
or adversely affect the law enforcement process, and/or where it may be 
appropriate to permit individuals to contest the accuracy of the 
information collected, e.g., public source materials, the applicable 
exemption may be waived, either partially or totally, by the National 
Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC). Exemptions from the particular 
subsections are justified for the following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) for the same reasons that the system is 
exempted from the provisions of subsection (d).
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) because this system is exempt from the 
access provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to subsection (j)(2) of the 
Privacy Act.
    (3) From subsection (d) because disclosure to the subject could 
alert the subject of an investigation pertaining to narcotic trafficking 
or related activity of the fact and nature of the investigation, and/or 
of the investigative interest of NDIC and other intelligence or law 
enforcement agencies (including those responsible for civil proceedings 
related to laws against drug trafficking); lead to the destruction of 
evidence, improper influencing of witnesses, fabrication of testimony, 
and/or flight of the subject; reveal the details of a sensitive 
investigative or intelligence technique, or the identity of a 
confidential source; or otherwise impede, compromise, or interfere with 
investigative efforts and other related

[[Page 311]]

law enforcement and/or intelligence activities. In addition, disclosure 
could invade the privacy of third parties and/or endanger the life and 
safety of law enforcement personnel, confidential informants, witnesses, 
and potential crime victims. Finally, access to records could result in 
the release of properly classified information that could compromise the 
national defense or foreign policy. Amendment of the records would 
interfere with ongoing investigations and law enforcement activities and 
impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring investigations, 
analyses, and reports to be continuously reinvestigated and revised.
    (4) From subsection (e)(1) because, in the course of its 
acquisition, collation, and analysis of information, NDIC will need to 
retain information not immediately shown to be relevant to counterdrug 
law enforcement to establish patterns of activity and to assist other 
agencies charged with the enforcement of laws and regulations regarding 
drug trafficking and charged with the acquisition of intelligence 
related to international aspects of drug trafficking. This consideration 
applies equally to information acquired from, or collated or analyzed 
for, both law enforcement agencies and agencies of the U.S. foreign 
intelligence community.
    (5) From subsection (e)(2) because application of this provision 
could present a serious impediment to law enforcement in that it would 
put the subject of an investigation, study or analysis on notice of the 
fact of such investigation, study, or analysis, thereby permitting the 
subject to engage in conduct intended to frustrate the activity; 
because, in some circumstances, the subject of an investigation may not 
be required to provide to investigators certain information; and because 
thorough analysis and investigation may require seeking information from 
a number of different sources.
    (6) From subsection (e)(3) (to the extent applicable) because the 
requirement that individuals supplying information be provided a form 
stating the requirements of subsection (e)(3) would constitute a serious 
impediment to law enforcement in that it could compromise the existence 
of a confidential investigation and reveal the identity of confidential 
informants and endanger their lives and safety.
    (7) From subsection (e)(4)(I), to the extent that this subsection is 
interpreted to require more detail regarding the record sources in this 
system than have been published in the Federal Register. Should the 
subsection be so interpreted, exemption from this provision is necessary 
to protect the confidentiality of the sources of criminal and other law 
enforcement information and to protect the privacy and physical safety 
of witnesses and informants. Furthermore, greater specificity concerning 
the sources of properly classified records could compromise national 
defense or foreign policy.
    (8) From subsection (e)(5) because the acquisition, collation, and 
analysis of information for law enforcement purposes does not permit 
advance determination whether such information is accurate or relevant, 
nor can such information be limited to that which is complete or 
apparently timely. Information of this type often requires further 
analysis and investigation to develop into a comprehensive whole that 
which is otherwise incomplete or even fragmentary. Moreover, its 
accuracy is continually subject to analysis and review, and, upon 
careful examination, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may 
acquire added significance as additional information brings new details 
to light. The restrictions imposed by subsection (e)(5) would restrict 
the ability of trained investigators and intelligence analysts to 
exercise their judgment in collating and analyzing information and would 
impede the development of criminal intelligence necessary for effective 
law enforcement.
    (9) From subsection (e)(8) because the individual notice 
requirements of subsection (e)(8) could present a serious impediment to 
law enforcement by revealing investigative techniques, procedures, or 
evidence.
    (10) From subsection (g) to the extent that the system is exempt 
from subsection (d).

Sec. 16.83  Exemption of the Executive Office for Immigration Review System--

limited access.

    (a) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(d):
    (1) The Executive Office for Immigration Review's Records and 
Management Information System (JUSTICE/EOIR-001).


This exemption applies only to the extent that information in the system 
is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k) (1) and (2).
    (b) Exemption from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (d) because access to information which has been 
properly classified pursuant to an Executive Order could have an adverse 
effect on the national security. In addition, from subsection (d) 
because unauthorized access to certain investigatory material could 
compromise ongoing or potential investigations; reveal the identity of 
confidential informants; or constitute unwarranted invasions of the 
personal privacy of third parties.
    (2) From subsection (d) (2), (3), and (4) because the record of 
proceeding constitutes an official record which includes transcripts of 
quasi-judicial administrative proceedings, investigatory materials, 
evidentiary materials such as exhibits, decisional memoranda, and other 
case-related papers. Administrative due process could not be achieved by 
the ex parte ``correction'' of such materials by the individual who is 
the subject thereof.
    (c) The following system of records is exempted form 5 U.S.C. 
552a(d).
    (1) Practitioner Compliant/Disciplinary Files (JUSTICE/EOIR 003). 
This exemption applies only to the extent that information in this 
system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), 
and (k)(2). To the extent that information in a record pertaining to an 
individual does not relate to national defense or foreign policy, 
official Federal investigations and/or law enforcement matters, the 
exemption does not apply. In addition, where compliance would not appear 
to interfere with or adversely affect the overall law or regulatory 
enforcement process, the applicable exemption may be waived by the 
Executive Office for Immigration Review.
    (d) Exemption from subsection (d) is justified for the following 
reasons:
    (1) From the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d) 
because access to the records contained in this system of records could 
inform the subject of the investigation of an actual or potential 
criminal, civil, or regulatory violation or the existence of that 
investigation; of the nature and scope of the information and evidence 
obtained as to the subject's activities; of the identity of confidential 
sources, witnesses, and law enforcement personnel; and of information 
that may enable the subject to avoid detection or apprehension. These 
factors would present a serious impediment to effective law and 
regulatory enforcement where they prevent the successful completion of 
the investigation, endanger the physical safety of confidential sources, 
witnesses, and law enforcement personnel, and/or lead to the improper 
influencing of witnesses, the destruction of evidence, or the 
fabrication of testimony. In addition, granting access to such 
information could disclose security-sensitive or confidential business 
information or information that would constitute an unwarranted invasion 
of the personal privacy of third parties. Finally, access to the records 
could result in the release of properly classified information which 
would compromise the national defense or disrupt foreign policy. 
Amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing investigations and 
law enforcement activities and impose an enormous administrative burden 
by requiring investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.

[Order No. 18-86, 51 FR 32305, Sept. 11, 1986, as amended by Order No.

Sec. 16.84  Exemption of Immigration Appeals System.

    (a) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) 
(2), (3) and (4):
    (1) Decisions of the Board of Immigration Appeals (JUSTICE/BIA-001).


This exemption applies only to the extent that information in this 
system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k).

[[Page 313]]

    (b) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsections (d) (2), (3) and (4) because the decisions 
reflected constitute official records of opinions rendered in quasi-
judicial proceedings. Administrative due process could not be achieved 
by the ex parte ``correction'' of such opinions by the subject of the 
opinion.


<R05>
Sec. 16.85  Exemption of U.S. Parole Commission--limited access.

    (a) The following systems of records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a 
(c) (3) and (4), (d), (e) (2) and (3), (e)(4) (G) and (H), (e)(8), (f) 
and (g):
    (1) Docket Scheduling and Control System (JUSTICE/PRC-001).
    (2) Inmate and Supervision Files System (JUSTICE/PRC-003).
    (3) Labor and Pension Case, Legal File, and General Correspondence 
System (JUSTICE/PRC-004).
    (4) Statistical, Educational and Developmental System (JUSTICE/PRC-
006).
    (5) Workload Record, Decision Result, and Annual Report System 
(JUSTICE/PRC-007).


These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in these 
systems is subject to exemptions pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).
    (b) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because revealing disclosure of 
accountings to inmates and persons on supervision could compromise 
legitimate law enforcement activities and U.S. Parole Commission 
responsibilities.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) because the exemption from subsection (d) 
will make notification of disputes inapplicable.
    (3) From subsection (d) because this is essential to protect 
internal processes by which Commission personnel are able to formulate 
decisions and policies with regard to federal prisoners and persons 
under supervision, to prevent disclosures of information to federal 
inmates or persons on supervision that would jeopardize legitimate 
correctional interests of security, custody, supervision, or 
rehabilitation, to permit receipt of relevant information from other 
federal agencies, state and local law enforcement agencies, and federal 
and state probation and judicial offices, to allow private citizens to 
express freely their opinions for or against parole, to allow relevant 
criminal history type information of co-defendants to be kept in files, 
to allow medical, psychiatric and sociological material to be available 
to professional staff, and to allow a candid process of fact selection, 
opinion formulation, evaluation and recommendation to be continued by 
professional staff. The legal files contain case development material 
and, in addition to other reasons, should be exempt under the attorney-
client privilege. Each labor or pension applicant has had served upon 
him the material in his file which he did not prepare and may see his 
own file at any time.
    (4) From subsection (e)(2) because primary collection of information 
directly from federal inmates or persons on supervision about criminal 
sentence, criminal records, institutional performance, readiness for 
release from custody, or need to be returned to custody is highly 
impractical and inappropriate.
    (5) From subsection (e)(3) because application of this provision to 
the operations and collection of information by the Commission which is 
primarily from sources other than the individual, is inappropriate.
    (6) From subsections (e)(4) (G) and (H) because exemption from the 
access provisions of (d) makes publication of agency procedures under 
(d) inapplicable.
    (7) From subsection (e)(8) because the nature of the Commission's 
activities renders notice of compliance with compulsory legal process 
impractical.
    (8) From subsection (f) because exemption from the provisions of 
subsection (d) will render compliance with provisions of this subsection 
inapplicable.
    (9) From subsection (g) because exemption from the provisions of 
subsection (d) will render the provisions on suits to enforce (d) 
inapplicable.
    (c) Consistent with the legislative purpose of the Privacy Act of 
1974 the U.S. Parole Commission will initiate a

[[Page 314]]

procedure whereby present and former prisoners and parolees may obtain 
copies of material in files relating to them that are maintained by the 
U.S. Parole Commission. Disclosure of the contents will be affected by 
providing copies of documents to requesters through the mails. 
Disclosure will be made to the same extent as would be made under the 
substantive exemptions of the Parole Commission and Reorganization Act 
of 1976 (18 U.S.C. 4208) and Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal 
Procedure. The procedure relating to disclosure of documents may be 
changed generally in the interest of improving the Commission's system 
of disclosure or when required by pending or future decisions and 
directions of the Department of Justice.

Sec. 16.88  Exemption of Antitrust Division Systems--limited access.

    (a) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a 
(c)(3), (d), (e)(4) (G) and (H), and (f):
    (1) Antitrust Caseload Evaluation System (ACES)--Monthly Report 
(JUSTICE/ATR-006).


These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in this 
system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (k)(2).
    (b) Exemption from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because information in this system is 
maintained in aid of ongoing antitrust enforcement investigations and 
proceedings. The release of the accounting of disclosures made under 
subsection (b) of the Act would permit the subject of an investigation 
of an actual or potential criminal or civil violation to determine 
whether he is the subject of an investigation. Disclosure of the 
accounting would therefore present a serious impediment to antitrust law 
enforcement efforts.
    (2) From subsection (d) because access to the information 
retrievable from this system and compiled for law enforcement purposes 
could result in the premature disclosure of the identity of the subject 
of an investigation of an actual or potential criminal or civil 
violation and information concerning the nature of that investigation. 
This information could enable the subject to avoid detection or 
apprehension. This would present a serious impediment to effective law 
enforcement since the subject could hinder or prevent the successful 
completion of the investigation. Further, confidential business and 
financial information, the identities of confidential sources of 
information, third party privacy information, and statutorily 
confidential information such as grand jury information must be 
protected from disclosure.
    (3) From subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) because this system 
is exempt from the individual access provisions of subsection (d).
    (c) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a 
(c)(3), (d), (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f):
    (1) Freedom of Information/Privacy--Requester/Subject Index File 
(JUSTICE/ATR-008).


These exemptions apply to the extent that information in this system is 
subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (k)(2).
    (d) Because this system contains Department of Justice civil and 
criminal law enforcement, investigatory records, exemptions from the 
particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of the accounting of 
disclosures made under subsection (b) of the Act would permit the 
subject of an investigation of an actual or potential criminal or civil 
violation to determine whether he is the subject of an investigation. 
Disclosure of accounting would therefore present a serious impediment to 
antitrust law enforcement efforts.
    (2) From subsection (d) because access to information in this system 
could result in the premature disclosure of the identity of the subject 
of an investigation of an actual or potential criminal or civil 
violation and information concerning the nature of the investigation. 
This information could enable the subject to avoid detection or

[[Page 315]]

apprehension. This would present a serious impendiment to effective law 
enforcement since the subject could hinder or prevent the successful 
completion of the investigation. Further, confidential business and 
financial information, the identities of confidential sources of 
information, third party privacy information, and statutorily 
confidential information such as grand jury information must be 
protected from disclosure.
    (3) From subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) because this system 
is exempt from the individual access provisions of subsection (d).

Sec. 16.89  Exemption of Civil Division Systems--limited access.

    (a) The following systems of records are exempted pursuant to 5 
U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) from subsections (c) (3) and (4), (d), (e)(1), (e)(2), 
(e)(3), (e)(4) (G) and (H), (e)(5), (e)(8), and (g); in addition, the 
following systems of records are exempted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a 
(k)(1) and (k)(2) from subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G) and 
(H):
    (1) Civil Division Case File System, JUSTICE/CIV-001.
    (2) Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts File System, JUSTICE/CIV-
005.


These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in these 
systems is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j)(2), (k)(1) 
and (k)(2).
    (b) Only that information which relates to the investigation, 
prosecution, or defense of actual or potential criminal or civil 
litigation, or which has been properly classified in the interest of 
national defense and foreign policy is exempted for the reasons set 
forth from the following subsections:
    (1) Subsection (c)(3). To provide the subject of a criminal or civil 
matter or case under investigation with an accounting of disclosures of 
records concerning him or her would inform that individual (and others 
to whom the subject might disclose the records) of the existence, 
nature, or scope of that investigation and thereby seriously impede law 
enforcement efforts by permitting the record subject and others to avoid 
criminal penalties and civil remedies.
    (2) Subsections (c)(4), (e)(4) (G) and (H), and (g). These 
provisions are inapplicable to the extent that these systems of records 
are exempted from subsection (d).
    (3) Subsection (d). To the extent that information contained in 
these systems has been properly classified, relates to the investigation 
and/or prosecution of grand jury, civil fraud, and other law enforcement 
matters, disclosure could compromise matters which should be kept secret 
in the interest of national security or foreign policy; compromise 
confidential investigations or proceedings; hamper sensitive civil or 
criminal investigations; impede affirmative enforcement actions based 
upon alleged violations of regulations or of civil or criminal laws; 
reveal the identity of confidential sources; and result in unwarranted 
invasions of the privacy of others. Amendment of the records would 
interfere with ongoing criminal law enforcement proceedings and impose 
an impossible administrative burden by requiring criminal investigations 
to be continuously reinvestigated.
    (4) Subsection (e)(1). In the course of criminal or civil 
investigations, cases, or matters, the Civil Division may obtain 
information concerning the actual or potential violation of laws which 
are not strictly within its statutory authority. In the interest of 
effective law enforcement, it is necessary to retain such information 
since it may establish patterns of criminal activity or avoidance of 
other civil obligations and provide leads for Federal and other law 
enforcement agencies.
    (5) Subsection (e)(2). To collect information from the subject of a 
criminal investigation or prosecution would present a serious impediment 
to law enforcement in that the subject (and others to whom the subject 
might be in contact) would be informed of the existence of the 
investigation and would therefore be able to avoid detection or 
apprehension, to influence witnesses improperly, to destroy evidence, or 
to fabricate testimony.
    (6) Subsection (e)(3). To comply with this requirement during the 
course of a criminal investigation or prosecution could jeopardize the 
investigation by

[[Page 316]]

disclosing the existence of a confidential investigation, revealing the 
identity of witnesses or confidential informants, or impeding the 
information gathering process.
    (7) Subsection (e)(5). In compiling information for criminal law 
enforcement purposes, the accuracy, completeness, timeliness and 
relevancy of the information obtained cannot always be immediately 
determined. As new details of an investigation come to light, seemingly 
irrelevant or untimely information may acquire new significance and the 
accuracy of such information can often only be determined in a court of 
law. Compliance with this requirement would therefore restrict the 
ability of government attorneys in exercising their judgment in 
developing information necessary for effective law enforcement.
    (8) Subsection (e)(8). To serve notice would give persons sufficient 
warning to evade law enforcement efforts.
    (c) The following system of records is exempted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552a(j)(2) from subsections (c) (3) and (4), (d), (e)(1) and (e)(5); in 
addition, this system is also exempted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) 
from subsections (c)(3), (d), and (e)(1).

Consumer Inquiry/Investigatory System, JUSTICE/CIV-006.


These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in this 
system of records is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a 
(j)(2) and (k)(2).
    (d) Only that information compiled for criminal or civil law 
enforcement purposes is exempted for the reasons set forth from the 
following subsections:
    (1) Subsections (c)(3). This system occasionally contains 
investigatory material based on complaints of actual or alleged criminal 
or civil violations. To provide the subject of a criminal or civil 
matter or case under investigation with an accounting of disclosures of 
records concerning him/her would inform that individual of the 
existence, nature, or scope of that investigation, and thereby seriously 
impede law enforcement efforts by permitting the record subject and 
other persons to whom he might disclose the records to avoid criminal 
penalties and civil remedies.
    (2) Subsections (c)(4). This subsection is inapplicable to the 
extent that an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d).
    (3) Subsection (d). Disclosure of information relating to the 
investigation of complaints of alleged violation of criminal or civil 
law could interfere with the investigation, reveal the identity of 
confidential sources, and result in an unwarranted invasion of the 
privacy of others. Amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing 
criminal law enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible 
administrative burden by requiring criminal investigations to be 
continuously reinvestigated.
    (4) Subsection (e)(1). In the course of criminal or civil 
investigations, cases, or matters, the Civil Division may obtain 
information concerning the actual or potential violation of laws which 
are not strictly within its statutory authority. In the interest of 
effective law enforcement, it is necessary to retain such information 
since it may establish patterns of criminal activity or avoidance of 
other civil obligations and provide leads for Federal and other law 
enforcement agencies.
    (5) Subsection (e)(5). In compiling information for criminal law 
enforcement purposes, the accuracy, completeness, timeliness and 
relevancy of the information obtained cannot always be immediately 
determined. As new details of an investigation come to light, seemingly 
irrelevant or untimely information may acquire new significance and the 
accuracy of such information can often only be determined in a court of 
law. Compliance with this requirement would therefore restrict the 
ability of government attorneys in exercising their judgment in 
developing information necessary for effective law enforcement.
    (e) The following system of records is exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552a (j)(2) and (k)(2) from subsection (d):

Congressional and Citizen Correspondence File, JUSTICE/CIV-007.


This exemption applies only to the extent that information in this 
system is

[[Page 317]]

subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C 552a (j)(2) and (k)(2).
    (f) Only that portion of the Congressional and Citizen 
Correspondence File maintained by the Communications Office which 
consists of criminal or civil investigatory information is exempted for 
the reasons set forth from the following subsection:
    (1) Subsection (d). Disclosure of investigatory information would 
jeopardize the integrity of the investigative process, disclose the 
identity of individuals who furnished information to the government 
under an express or implied promise that their identities would be held 
in confidence, and result in an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of 
others. Amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing criminal 
law enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible administrative 
burden by requiring criminal investigations to be continuously 
reinvestigated.

<R05>
Sec. 16.90  Exemption of Civil Rights Division Systems.

    (a) The following system of records is exempted from subsections 
(c)(3) and (4); (d)(1), (2), (3) and (4); (e)(1), (2), (3), (5), and 
(8); and (g) of the Privacy Act pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j) and (k): 
Central Civil Rights Division Index File and Associated Records 
(JUSTICE/CRT-001). These exemptions apply only to the extent that 
information in a record is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552a (j)(2), (k)(1) and (k)(2).
    (b) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) Subsection (c)(3). To provide the subject of a criminal, civil, 
or administrative matter or case under investigation with an accounting 
of disclosures of records concerning him or her could inform that 
individual of the existence, nature, or scope of an actual or potential 
criminal or civil violation to gain valuable information concerning the 
nature and scope of the investigation, to determine whether he or she is 
the subject of the investigation, and seriously impede law enforcement 
efforts by permitting the record subject and other persons to whom he or 
she might disclose the records to avoid criminal penalties, civil 
remedies, or administrative measures.
    (2) Subsection (c)(4). This subsection is inapplicable to the extent 
that an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d).
    (3) Subsection (d)(1). Disclosure of investigatory information could 
interfere with the investigation, reveal the identity of confidential 
sources, and result in an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of others. 
Disclosure of classified national security information would cause 
damage to the national security of the United States. In addition, these 
records may be subject to protective orders entered by federal courts to 
protect their confidentiality. Further, many of the records contained in 
this system are copies of documents which are the property of state 
agencies and were obtained under express or implied promises to strictly 
protect their confidentiality.
    (4) Subsection (d)(2). Amendment of the records could interfere with 
ongoing criminal or civil law enforcement proceedings and impose an 
impossible administrative burden by requiring investigations to be 
continuously reinvestigated.
    (5) Subsection (d)(3) and (4). These subsections are inapplicable to 
the extent exemption is claimed from (d)(1) and (2).
    (6) Subsection (e)(1). It is often impossible to determine in 
advance if investigatory records contained in this system are accurate, 
relevant, timely and complete, but, in the interests of effective law 
enforcement, it is necessary to retain this information to aid in 
establishing patterns of activity and provide investigative leads.
    (7) Subsection (e)(2). To collect information from the subject 
individual could serve notice that he or she is the subject of a 
criminal investigation and thereby present a serious impediment to such 
investigation.
    (8) Subsection (e)(3). To inform individuals as required by this 
subsection could reveal the existence of a criminal or civil 
investigation and compromise investigative efforts.

[[Page 318]]

    (9) Subsection (e)(5). It is often impossible to determine in 
advance if investigatory records contained in this system are accurate, 
relevant, timely and complete, but, in the interests of effective law 
enforcement, it is necessary to retain this information to aid in 
establishing patterns of activity and provide investigative leads.
    (10) Subsection (e)(8). To serve notice could give persons 
sufficient warning to evade investigative efforts.
    (11) Subsection (g). This subsection is inapplicable to the extent 
that the system is exempt from other specific subsections of the Privacy 
Act.
    (c) The following system of records is exempted from subsections 
(d)(1), (2), (3) and (4) of the Privacy Act pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a 
(k): ``Files on Employment Civil Rights Matters Referred by the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission (JUSTICE/CRT-007).'' These exemptions 
apply only to the extent that information in a record is subject to 
exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (k)(2).
    (d) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) Subsection (d)(1). Disclosure of investigatory information could 
interfere with the investigation, reveal the identity of confidential 
sources, and result in an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of others. 
In addition, these records may be subject to protective orders entered 
by federal courts to protect their confidentiality. Further, many of the 
records contained in this system are copies of documents which are the 
property of state agencies and were obtained under express or implied 
promises to strictly protect their confidentiality.
    (2) Subsection (d)(2). Amendment of the records could interfere with 
ongoing criminal or civil law enforcement proceedings and impose an 
impossible administrative burden by requiring investigations to be 
continuously reinvestigated.
    (3) Subsection (d)(1), (2), (3) and (4). This system contains 
investigatory material compiled by the Equal Opportunity Commission 
pursuant to its authority under 42 U.S.C. 2000e-8. Titles 42 U.S.C. 
2000e-5(b), 42 U.S.C. 2000e-8(e), and 44 U.S.C. 3508 make it unlawful to 
make public in any manner whatsoever any information obtained by the 
Commission pursuant to the authority.
    (4) Subsection (d)(3) and (4). These subsections are inapplicable to 
the extent exemption is claimed from (d)(1) and (2).

<R05>
Sec. 16.91  Exemption of Criminal Division Systems--limited access, as 

indicated.

    (a) The following systems of records are exempted pursuant to the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) from subsections (c) (3) and (4), (d), 
(e) (1), (2) and (3), (e)(4) (G), (H) and (I), (e) (5) and (8), (f) and 
(g) of 5 U.S.C. 552a; in addition, the following systems of records are 
exempted pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a (k)(1) and (k)(2) 
from subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I), and (f) 
of 5 U.S.C. 552a:
    (1) Central Criminal Division, Index File and Associated Records 
System of Records (JUSTICE/CRM-001)--Limited Access. This system of 
records and associated exemptions is adopted by and applies with equal 
force and effect to the National Security Division, until modified, 
superseded, or revoked in accordance with law.
    (2) General Crimes Section, Criminal Division, Central Index File 
and Associated Records System of Records (JUSTICE/CRM-004)--Limited 
Access.


These exemptions apply to the extent that information in those systems 
are subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j)(2), (k)(1) and 
(k)(2).
    (b) The systems of records listed under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) 
of this section are exempted, for the reasons set forth, from the 
following provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a:
    (1). (c)(3). The release of the disclosure accounting for 
disclosures made pursuant to subsection (b) of the Act, including those 
permitted under the routine uses published for these systems of records, 
would permit the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential 
criminal, civil, or regulatory violation to determine whether he is the 
subject of investigation, or to obtain valuable information concerning 
the nature of that investigation, and

[[Page 319]]

the information obtained, or the identity of witnesses and informants 
and would therefore present a serious impediment to law enforcement. In 
addition, disclosure of the accounting would amount to notice to the 
individual of the existence of a record; such notice requirement under 
subsection (f)(1) is specifically exempted for these systems of records.
    (2). (c)(4). Since an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d) 
of the Act (Access to Records) this subsection is inapplicable to the 
extent that these systems of records are exempted from subsection (d).
    (3). (d). Access to the records contained in these systems would 
inform the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential 
criminal, civil, or regulatory violation of the existence of that 
investigation, or the nature and scope of the information and evidence 
obtained as to his activities, of the identity of witnesses and 
informants, or would provide information that could enable the subject 
to avoid detection or apprehension. These factors would present a 
serious impediment to effective law enforcement because they could 
prevent the successful completion of the investigation, endanger the 
physical safety of witnesses or informants, and lead to the improper 
influencing of witnesses, the destruction of evidence, or the 
fabrication of testimony.
    (4). (e)(1). The notices of these systems of records published in 
the Federal Register set forth the basic statutory or related authority 
for maintenance of this system. However, in the course of criminal or 
other law enforcement investigations, cases, and matters, the Criminal 
Division or its components will occasionally obtain information 
concerning actual or potential violations of law that are not strictly 
within its statutory or other authority or may compile information in 
the course of an investigation which may not be relevant to a specific 
prosecution. In the interests of effective law enforcement, it is 
necessary to retain such information in these systems of records since 
it can aid in establishing patterns of criminal activity and can provide 
valuable leads for federal and other law enforcement agencies.
    (5). (e)(2). In a criminal investigation or prosecution, the 
requirement that information be collected to the greatest extent 
practicable from the subject individual would present a serious 
impediment to law enforcement because the subject of the investigation 
or prosecution would be placed on notice as to the existence of the 
investigation and would therefore be able to avoid detection or 
apprehension, to influence witnesses improperly, to destroy evidence, or 
to fabricate testimony.
    (6). (e)(3). The requirement that individuals supplying information 
be provided with a form stating the requirements of subsection (e)(3) 
would constitute a serious impediment to law enforcement in that it 
could compromise the existence of a confidential investigation or reveal 
the identity of witnesses or confidential informants.
    (7). (e)(4) (G) and (H). Since an exemption is being claimed for 
subsections (f) (Agency Rules) and (d) (Access to Records) of the Act 
these subsections are inapplicable to the extent that these systems of 
records are exempted from subsections (f) and (d).
    (8). (e)(4)(I). The categories of sources of the records in these 
systems have been published in the Federal Register in broad generic 
terms in the belief that this is all that subsection (e)(4)(I) of the 
Act requires. In the event, however, that this subsection should be 
interpreted to require more detail as to the identity of sources of the 
records in these systems, exemption from this provision is necessary in 
order to protect the confidentiality of the sources of criminal and 
other law enforcement information. Such exemption is further necessary 
to protect the privacy and physical safety of witnesses and informants.
    (9). (e)(5). In the collection of information for criminal law 
enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance what 
information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. With the 
passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may 
acquire new significance as further investigation brings new details to 
light and the accuracy of such information can often only be determined 
in a court

[[Page 320]]

of law. The restrictions of subsection (e)(5) would restrict the ability 
of trained investigators, intelligence analysts, and government 
attorneys in exercising their judgment in reporting on information and 
investigations and impede the development of criminal or other 
intelligence necessary for effective law enforcement.
    (10). (e)(8). The individual notice requirements of subsection 
(e)(8) could present a serious impediment to law enforcement as this 
could interfere with the ability to issue warrants or subpoenas and 
could reveal investigative techniques, procedures, or evidence.
    (11). (f). Procedures for notice to an individual pursuant to 
subsection (f)(1) as to the existence of records pertaining to him 
dealing with an actual or potential criminal, civil, or regulatory 
investigation or prosecution must be exempted because such notice to an 
individual would be detrimental to the successful conduct and/or 
completion of an investigation or prosecution pending or future. In 
addition, mere notice of the fact of an investigation could inform the 
subject or others that their activities are under or may become the 
subject of an investigation and could enable the subjects to avoid 
detection or apprehension, to influence witnesses improperly, to destroy 
evidence, or to fabricate testimony.
    Since an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d) of the Act 
(Access to Records) the rules require pursuant to subsection (f) (2) 
through (5) are inapplicable to these systems of records to the extent 
that these systems of records are exempted from subsection (d).
    (12). (g). Since an exemption is being claimed for subsections (d) 
(Access to Records) and (f) (Agency Rules) this section is inapplicable, 
and is exempted for the reasons set forth for those subsections, to the 
extent that these systems of records are exempted from subsections (d) 
and (f).
    (13). In addition, exemption is claimed for these systems of records 
from compliance with the following provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 
(5 U.S.C. 552a) pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1): 
Subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G), (H) and (I) and (f) to the 
extent that the records contained in these systems are specifically 
authorized to be kept secret in the interests of national defense and 
foreign policy.
    (c) The following system of records is exempted pursuant to the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) (2) from subsection (c) (3) and (4), (d), 
(e) (1), (2) and (3), (e) (4) (G), (H) and (I), (e) (5) and (8), (f) and 
(g) of 5 U.S.C. 552a:

Criminal Division Witness Security File System of Records(JUSTICE/CRM-
002).


These exemptions apply to the extent that information in this system is 
subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).
    (d) The system of records listed under paragraph (c) of this section 
is exempted, for the reasons set forth, from the following provisions of 
5 U.S.C. 552a:
    (1). (c)(3) The release of the disclosure accounting for disclosures 
made pursuant to subsection (b) of the Act, including those permitted 
under the routine uses published for these systems of records, would 
permit the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential 
criminal violation, which may include those protected under the Witness 
Security Program, to determine whether he is the subject of a criminal 
investigation, to obtain valuable information concerning the nature of 
that investigation and the information obtained, or the identity of 
witnesses and informants and the nature of their reports, and would 
therefore present a serious impediment to law enforcement. In addition, 
disclosure of the accounting would amount to notice to the individual of 
the existence of a record; such notice requirement under subsection 
(f)(1) is specifically exempted for these systems of records. Moreover, 
disclosure of the disclosure accounting to an individual protected under 
the Witness Security Program could jeopardize the effectiveness and 
security of the Program by revealing the methods and techniques utilized 
in relocating witnesses and could therefore jeopardize the ability to 
obtain, and to protect the confidentiality of, information compiled for 
purposes of a criminal investigation.
    (2). (c)(4) Since an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d) 
of the Act

[[Page 321]]

(Access to Records) this section is inapplicable.
    (3). (d) Access to the records contained in these systems would 
inform the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential 
criminal violation, which may include those protected under the Witness 
Security Program, of the existence of that investigation, of the nature 
and scope of the information and evidence obtained as to his activities, 
of the identity of witnesses and informants, or would provide 
information that could enable the subject to avoid detection or 
apprehension. These factors would present a serious impediment to 
effective law enforcement because they could prevent the successful 
completion of the investigation, endanger the physical safety of 
witnesses or informants, and lead to the improper influencing of 
witnesses, the destruction of evidence, or the fabrication of testimony. 
In addition, access to the records in these systems to an individual 
protected under the Witness Security Program could jeopardize the 
effectiveness and security of the Program by revealing the methods and 
techniques utilized in relocating witnesses and could therefore 
jeopardize the ability to obtain, and to protect the confidentiality of, 
information compiled for purposes of a criminal investigation.
    (4). Exemption is claimed from subsection (e)(1) for the reasons 
stated in subsection (b)(4) of this section.
    (5). (e)(2) In the course of preparing a Witness Security Program 
for an individual, much of the information is collected from the 
subject. However, the requirement that the information be collected to 
the greatest extent practicable from the subject individual would 
present a serious impediment to criminal law enforcement because the 
individual himself may be the subject of a criminal investigation or 
have been a participant in, or observer of, criminal activity. As a 
result, it is necessary to seek information from other sources. In 
addition, the failure to verify the information provided from the 
individual when necessary and to seek other information could jeopardize 
the confidentiality of the Witness Security Program and lead to the 
obtaining and maintenance of incorrect and uninvestigated information on 
criminal matters.
    (6). (e)(3) The requirement that individuals supplying information 
be provided with a form stating the requirements of subsection (e)(3) 
would constitute a serious impediment to law enforcement in that it 
could compromise or reveal the identity of witnesses and informants 
protected under the Witness Security Program.
    (7). (e)(4) (G) and (H). Since an exemption is being claimed for 
subsections (f) (Agency Rules) and (d) (Access to Records) of the Act 
these subsections are inapplicable.
    (8). (e)(4)(I). The categories of sources of the records in these 
systems have been published in the Federal Register in broad generic 
terms in the belief that this is all that subsection (e)(4)(I) of the 
Act requires. In the event, however, that this subsection should be 
interpreted to require more detail as to the identity of sources of the 
records in the system, exemption from this provision is necessary in 
order to protect the confidentiality of the sources of criminal law, 
enforcement information and of witnesses and informants protected under 
the Witness Security Program.
    (9). Exemption is claimed from subsections (e)(5) and (e)(8) for the 
reasons stated in subsection (b)(9) and (b)(10) of this section.
    (10). Procedures for notice to an individual pursuant to subsection 
(f)(1) as to the existence of records contained in these systems 
pertaining to him would inform the subject of an investigation of an 
actual or potential criminal violation, which may include those 
protected under the Witness Security Program, of the existence of that 
investigation, of the nature and scope of the information and evidence 
obtained as to his activities, of the identity of witnesses and 
informants, or would provide information that could enable the subject 
to avoid detection or apprehension. These factors would present a 
serious impediment to effective law enforcement because they could 
prevent the successful conduct and/or completion of an investigation 
pending or future, endanger the physical safety of witnesses or 
informants, and lead to the improper influencing of witnesses,

[[Page 322]]

the destruction of evidence, or the fabrication of testimony. In 
addition, notices as to the existence of records contained in these 
systems to an individual protected under the Witness Security Program 
could jeopardize the effectiveness and security of the Program by 
revealing the methods and techniques utilized in relocating witnesses 
and could therefore jeopardize the ability to obtain, and to protect the 
confidentiality of, information compiled for purposes of a criminal 
investigation.


Since an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d) of the Act 
(Access to Records) the rules required pursuant to subsection (f) (2) 
through (5) are inapplicable.
    (11). (g) Since an exemption is being claimed for subsections (d) 
(Access to Records) and (f) (Agency Rules) this section is inapplicable 
and is exempted for the reasons set forth for those subsections.
    (e) The following system of records is exempted pursuant to the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) from subsections (c) (3) and (4), (d), 
(e) (4) (G), (H) and (I), (f), and (g) of 5 U.S.C. 552a:

Organized Crime and Racketeering Section, Intelligence and Special 
Services Unit, Information Request System of Records (JUSTICE/CRM-014).


These exemptions apply to the extent that information in this system is 
subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).
    (f) The system of records listed under paragraph (e) of this section 
is exempted for the reasons set forth, from the following provisions of 
5 U.S.C. 552a:
    (1). (c)(3). The release of the disclosure accounting for 
disclosures made pursuant to subsection (b) of the Act, including those 
permitted under the routine uses published for these systems of records, 
would permit the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential 
criminal violation to determine whether he is the subject of a criminal 
investigation and would therefore present a serious impediment to law 
enforcement. The records in these systems contain the names of the 
subjects of the files in question and the system is accessible by name 
of the person checking out the file and by name of the subject of the 
file. In addition, disclosure of the accounting would amount to notice 
to the individual of the existence of a record; such notice requirement 
under subsection (f)(1) is specifically exempted for these systems of 
records.
    (2). (c)(4). Since an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d) 
of the Act (Access to Records) this section is inapplicable.
    (3). (d). Access to the records contained in these systems would 
inform the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential 
criminal violation of the existence of that investigation. This would 
present a serious impediment to effective law enforcement because it 
could prevent the successful completion of the investigation, endanger 
the physical safety of witnesses or informants, and lead to the improper 
influencing of witnesses, the destruction of evidence, or the 
fabrication of testimony.
    (4). Exemption is claimed from subsections (e)(4) (G), (H) and (I) 
for the reasons stated in subsections (b)(7) and (b)(8) of this section.
    (5). (f). These systems may be accessed by the name of the person 
who is the subject of the file and who may also be the subject of a 
criminal investigation. Procedures for notice to an individual pursuant 
to subsection (f)(1) as to the existence of records pertaining to him, 
which may deal with an actual or potential criminal investigation or 
prosecution, must be exempted because such notice to an individual would 
be detrimental to the successful conduct and/or completion of the 
investigation or prosecution pending or future. In addition mere notice 
of the fact of an investigation could inform the subject or others that 
their activities are under or may become the subject of an investigation 
and could enable the subjects to avoid detection or apprehension, to 
influence witnesses improperly, to destroy evidence, or to fabricate 
testimony.


Since an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d) of the Act 
(Access to Records) the rules required pursuant to subsection (f) (2) 
through (5) are inapplicable.
    (6). (g). Since an exemption is being claimed for subsections (d) 
(Access to

[[Page 323]]

Records) and (f) (Agency Rules) of the Act this section is inapplicable 
and is exempted for the reasons set forth for those subsections.

    (g) The following system of records is exempted pursuant to the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) from subsections (c)(4), (d), (e)(4) 
(G), (H) and (I), (f) and (g) of 5 U.S.C. 552a.

File of Names Checked to Determine If Those Individuals Have Been the 
Subject of an Electronic Surveillance System of Records (JUSTICE/CRM-
003).


These exemptions apply to the extent that information in this system is 
subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).
    (h) The system of records listed under paragraph (g) of this section 
is exempted, for the reasons set forth, from the following provisions of 
5 U.S.C. 552a:
    (1). (c)(4). Since an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d) 
of the Act (Access to Records) this section is inapplicable to the 
extent that this system of records is exempted from subsection (d).
    (2). (d). The records contained in this system of records generally 
consist of information filed with the court in response to the request 
and made available to the requestor. To the extent that these records 
have been so filed, no exemption is sought from the provisions of this 
subsection. Occasionally, the records contain pertinent logs of 
intercepted communications and other investigative reports not filed 
with the court. These records must be exempted because access to such 
records could inform the subject of an investigation of an actual or 
potential criminal violation of the existence of that investigation and 
of the nature of the information and evidence obtained by the 
government. This would present a serious impediment to effective law 
enforcement because it could prevent the successful completion of the 
investigation, endanger the physical safety of witnesses or informants, 
and lead to the improper influencing of witnesses, the destruction of 
evidence, or the fabrication of testimony.
    (3). Exemption is claimed from subsections (e)(4) (G), (H) and (I) 
for the reasons stated in subsections (b)(7) and (b)(8) of this section.
    (4). (f). The records contained in this system of records generally 
consist of information filed with the court and made available to the 
requestor. To the extent that these records have been so filed, no 
exemption is sought from the provisions of this subsection. 
Occasionally, the records contain pertinent logs of intercepted 
communications and other investigative reports not filed with the court. 
These records must be exempted from a requirement of notification as to 
their existence because such notice to an individual would be 
detrimental to the successful conduct and/or completion of a criminal 
investigation or prosecution pending or future. In addition, mere notice 
of the existence of such logs or investigative reports could inform the 
subject or others that their activities are under or may become the 
subject of an investigation and could enable the subjects to avoid 
detection or apprehension, to influence witnesses improperly, to destroy 
evidence, or to fabricate testimony.


Since an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d) of the Act 
(Access to Records) the rules required pursuant to subsection (f) (2) 
through (5) are inapplicable to the extent that this system of records 
is exempted for subsection (d).
    (6). (g). Since an exemption is being claimed for subsections (d) 
(Access to Records) and (f) (Agency Rules) this section is inapplicable, 
and is exempted for the reasons set forth for those subsections, to the 
extent that this system of records is exempted from subsections (d) and 
(f).
    (i) The following systems of records are exempted pursuant to the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) from subsections (c) (3) and (4), (d), 
(e) (1), (2), and (3), (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I), (e) (5) and (8), (f) 
and (g) of 5 U.S.C. 552a:
    (1) Information File on Individuals and Commercial Entities Known or 
Suspected of Being Involved in Fraudulent Activities System of Records 
(JUSTICE/CRM-006).
    (2) The Stocks and Bonds Intelligence Control Card File System of 
Records (JUSTICE/CRM-021).

[[Page 324]]

    (3) Tax Disclosure Index File and Associated Records (JUSTICE/CRM-
025).


These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in these 
systems is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).
    (j) The systems of records listed in paragraphs (i)(1), (i)(2), and 
(i)(3) of this section are exempted, for the reasons set forth, from the 
following provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a:
    (1)(c)(3) The release of the disclosure accounting for disclosures 
made pursuant to subsection (b) of the act, including those permitted 
under the routine uses published for these systems of records, would 
permit the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential 
criminal violation to determine whether he is the subject of a criminal 
investigation, to obtain valuable information concerning the nature of 
that investigation, and the information obtained, or the identity of 
witnesses and informants, and would therefore present a serious 
impediment to law enforcement. In addition, disclosure of the accounting 
would amount to notice to the individual of the existence of a record; 
such notice requirement under subsection (f)(1) is specifically exempted 
for this system of records.
    (2)(c)(4) Since an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d) of 
the act (access to records), this section is inapplicable to the extent 
that these systems of records are exempted from subsection (d).
    (3)(d) Access to the records contained in these systems would inform 
the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential criminal 
violation of the existence of that investigation, of the nature and 
scope of the information and evidence obtained as to his activities, of 
the identity of witnesses and informants, or would provide information 
that could enable the subject to avoid detection or apprehension. These 
factors would present a serious impediment to effective law enforcement 
because they could prevent the successful completion of the 
investigation, endanger the physical safety of witnesses or informants, 
and lead to the improper influencing of witnesses, the destruction of 
evidence, or the fabrication of testimony.
    (4) Exemption is claimed from subsections (e) (1), (2), and (3), 
(e)(4) (G), (H), and (I), (e)(5) and (e)(8) for the reasons stated in 
subsections (b)(4), (b)(5), (b)(6), (b)(7), (b)(8), (b)(9), and (b)(10) 
of this section.
    (5)(f) Procedures for notice to an individual pursuant to subsection 
(f)(1) as to the existence of records pertaining to him dealing with an 
actual or potential criminal investigation or prosecution must be 
exempted because such notice to an individual would be detrimental to 
the successful conduct and/or completion of an investigation or 
prosecution pending or future. In addition, mere notice of the fact of 
an investigation could inform the subject or others that their 
activities are under or may become the subject of an investigation and 
could enable the subjects to avoid detection or apprehension, to 
influence witnesses improperly, to destroy evidence, or to fabricate 
testimony. Since an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d) of the 
act (access to records), the rules required pursuant to subsection (f) 
(2) through (5) are inapplicable to these systems of records.
    (6)(g) Since an exemption is being claimed for subsections (d) 
(access to records) and (f) (Agency rules), this section is inapplicable 
and is exempted for the reasons set forth for those subsections.
    (k) The following system of records is exempted pursuant to the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) from subsections (c) (3) and (4), (d), 
(e) (1), (2) and (3), (e)(4) (G), (H) and (I), (e) (5) and (8), (f) and 
(g) of 5 U.S.C. 552a; in addition, the following systems of records are 
exempted pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1) from 
subsections (c) (3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G), (H) and (I) and (f) of 5 
U.S.C. 552a:

Organized Crime and Racketeering Section, Criminal Division, General 
Index File and Associated Records System of Records (JUSTICE/CRM-012).


These exemptions apply to the extent that information in this system is 
subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and (k)(1).

[[Page 325]]

    (l) The system of records listed under paragraph (m)\1\ of this 
section is exempted, for the reasons set forth, from the following 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Paragraph (m) was redesignated as paragraph (k) at 44 FR 54046, 
Sept. 18, 1979.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1). Exemption is claimed from subsections (c) (3) and (4) and (d) 
for the reasons stated in subsections (j)(1), (j)(2) and (j)(3) of this 
section.
    (2). (e)(1). The notice for this system of records published in the 
Federal Register sets forth the basic statutory or related authority for 
maintenance of this system. However, in the course of criminal 
investigations, cases, and matters, the Organized Crime and Racketeering 
Section will occasionally obtain information concerning actual or 
potential violations of law that are not strictly within its statutory 
or other authority, or may compile information in the course of an 
investigation which may not be relevant to a specific prosecution. In 
the interests of effective law enforcement, it is necessary to retain 
such information in this system of records since it can aid in 
establishing patterns of criminal activity and can provide valuable 
leads for federal and other law enforcement agencies.
    (3). Exemption is claimed from subsections (e) (2) and (3), (e)(4) 
(G), (H) and (I), (e) (5) and (8), (f) and (g) for the reasons stated in 
subsections (b)(5), (b)(6), (b)(7), (b)(8), (b)(9), (b)(10), (b)(11) and 
(b)(12) of this section.
    (4). In addition, exemption is claimed for this system of records 
from compliance with the following provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 
(5 U.S.C. 552a) pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1): 
Subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G), (H) and (I) and (f) to the 
extent that the records contained in this system are specifically 
authorized to be kept secret in the interests of national defense and 
foreign policy.

    (m) The following system of records is exempted pursuant to the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) from subsections (c) (3) and (4), (d), 
(e) (2) and (3), (e) (4) (G), (H) and (I), (e) (8), (f) and (g) of 5 
U.S.C. 552a:

Requests to the Attorney General For Approval of Applications to Federal 
Judges For Electronic Interceptions System of Records (JUSTICE/CRM-019).


These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in this 
system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).
    (n) The system of records listed in paragraph (m) of this section is 
exempted for the reasons set forth, from the following provisions of 5 
U.S.C. 552a:
    (1). (c)(3). The release of the disclosure accounting for 
disclosures made pursuant to subsection (b) of the Act, including those 
permitted under the routine uses published for these systems of records, 
would permit the subject of an electronic interception to obtain 
valuable information concerning the interception, including information 
as to whether he is the subject of a criminal investigation, by means 
other than those provided for by statute. Such information could 
interfere with the successful conduct and/or completion of a criminal 
investigation, and would therefore present a serious impediment to law 
enforcement. In addition, disclosure of the accounting would amount to 
notice to the individual of the existence of a record; such notice 
requirement under subsection (f)(1) is specifically exempted for these 
systems of records.
    (2). (c)(4). Since an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d) 
of the Act (Access to Records) this section is inapplicable.
    (3). (d). Access to the records contained in these systems would 
inform the subject of an electronic interception of the existence of 
such surveillance including information as to whether he is the subject 
of a criminal investigation by means other than those provided for by 
statute. This could interfere with the successful conduct and/or 
completion of a criminal investigation and therefore present a serious 
impediment to law enforcement.
    (4). (e)(2). In the context of an electronic interception, the 
requirement that information be collected to the greatest extent 
practicable from the subject individual would present a serious 
impediment to law enforcement because the subject of the investigation

[[Page 326]]

or prosecution would be placed on notice as to the existence of the 
investigation and this would therefore destroy the efficacy of the 
interception.
    (5). (e)(3). The requirement that individuals supplying information 
be provided with a form stating the requirements of subsection (e)(3) 
would constitute a serious impediment to law enforcement in that it 
could compromise the existence of a confidential electronic interception 
or reveal the identity of witnesses or confidential informants.
    (6). (e)(4) (G) and (H). Since an exemption is being claimed for 
subsections (f) (Agency Rules) and (d) (Access to Records) of the Act 
these subsections are inapplicable.
    (7). Exemption is claimed from subsections (e)(4)(I) and (e)(8) for 
the reasons stated in subsections (b)(8) and (b)(10) of this section.
    (8). (f). Procedures for notice to an individual pursuant to 
subsection (f)(1) as to the existence of records pertaining to him 
dealing with an electronic interception other than pursuant to statute 
must be exempted because such notice to an individual would be 
detrimental to the successful conduct and/or completion of an 
investigation pending or future. In addition, mere notice of the fact of 
an electronic interception could inform the subject or others that their 
activities are under or may become the subject of an investigation and 
could enable the subjects to avoid detection or apprehension, to 
influence witnesses improperly, to destroy evidence, or to fabricate 
testimony.


Since an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d) of the Act 
(Access to Records) the rules required pursuant to subsection (f)(2) 
through (5) are inapplicable to these systems of records to the extent 
that these systems of records are exempted from subsection (d).
    (9). (g). Since an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d) 
(Access to Records) and (f) (Agency Rules) this section is inapplicable, 
and is exempted for the reasons set forth for those subsections, to the 
extent that these systems of records are exempted from subsection (d) 
and (f).
    (o) The following system of records is exempted pursuant to the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) from subsections (c) (3) and (4), (d), 
(e) (2) and (3), (e) (4) (G), (H), and (I), (e)(8), (f) and (g) of 5 
U.S.C. 552a; in addition the following system of records is exempted 
pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1) and (k)(2) from 
subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(4) (G), (H) and (I), and (f) of 5 U.S.C. 
552a:

Witness Immunity Records System of Records (JUSTICE/CRM-022).


These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in this 
system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j)(2) and 
(k)(1) and (k)(2).
    (p) The system of records listed under paragraph (q)\2\ of this 
section is exempted, for the reasons set forth, from the following 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Paragraph (q) was redesignated as paragraph (o) at 44 FR 54046, 
Sept. 18, 1979.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1). (c)(3). Release of the accounting of disclosures made pursuant 
to subsection (b) of the Act, including those permitted under the 
routine uses published for this system of records, (a) as to a witness 
for whom immunity has been proposed, would inform the individual of the 
existence of the proposed immunity prematurely, thus creating a serious 
impediment to effective law enforcement in that the witness could flee, 
destroy evidence, or fabricate testimony; and (b) as to a witness to 
whom immunity has been granted, or for whom it has been denied, would 
reveal the nature and scope of the activities, if any, of the witness 
known to the government, which would also create a serious impediment to 
effective law enforcement.
    (2). (c)(4). Since an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d) 
of the Act (Access to Records) this section is inapplicable to the 
extent that this system of records is exempted from subsection (d).
    (3). (d). Access to the records contained in this system (a) as to a 
witness for whom immunity has been proposed, would inform the individual 
of the existence of the proposed immunity prematurely, thus presenting a 
serious impediment to effective law enforcement in that the witness 
could flee, destroy evidence, or fabricate testimony;

[[Page 327]]

and (b) as to a witness to whom immunity has been granted, or for whom 
it has been denied, would reveal the nature and scope of the activities, 
if any, of the witness known to the government, which would also create 
a serious impediment to effective law enforcement.
    (4). (e)(2). In a witness immunity request matter, the requirement 
that information be collected to the greatest extent practicable from 
the subject individual would present a serious impediment to law 
enforcement because the subject of the immunity request and often the 
subject of the underlying investigation or prosecution would be placed 
on notice as to the existence of the investigation and would therefore 
be able to avoid detection or apprehension, to influence witnesses 
improperly, to destroy evidence, or to fabricate testimony.
    (5). Exemption is claimed from subsections (e)(3), (e)(4)(G), (H) 
and (I), and (e)(8) for the reasons stated in subsections (b)(6), 
(b)(7), (b)(8) and (b)(10) of this section.
    (6). (f). Procedures for notice to an individual pursuant to 
subsection (f)(1) as to the existence of records pertaining to him (a) 
as to a witness for whom immunity has been proposed, would inform the 
individual of the existence of the proposed immunity prematurely, thus 
presenting a serious impediment to effective law enforcement in that the 
witness could flee, destroy evidence, or fabricate testimony; and (b) as 
to a witness to whom immunity has been granted, or for whom it has been 
denied, would reveal the nature and scope of the activity, if any, of 
the witness known to the government, which would also create a serious 
impediment to effective law enforcement.


Since an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d) of the Act 
(Access to Records) the rules required pursuant to subsection (f)(2) 
through (5) are inapplicable to this system of records to the extent 
that this system of records is exempted from subsection (d).
    (7). (g). Since an exemption is being claimed for subsections (d) 
(Access to Records) and (f) (Agency Rules) this section is inapplicable, 
and is exempted for the reasons set forth for those subsections, to the 
extent that this system of records is exempted for subsections (d) and 
(f).
    (8). In addition, exemption is claimed for this system of records 
from compliance with the following provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 
(5 U.S.C. 552a) pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1): 
subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G), (H) and (I) and (f) to the 
extent that the records contained in this system are specifically 
authorized to be kept secret in the interests of national defense and 
foreign policy.
    (q) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c) 
(3) and (4), (d), (e) (1), (2) and (3), (e)(4) (G), (H) and (I), (e) (5) 
and (8), (f), and (g):
    (1) Freedom of Information/Privacy Act Records (JUSTICE/CRM-024)


These exemptions apply to the extent that information in this system is 
subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), (k)(1) and (k)(2).
    (r) Because this system contains Department of Justice civil and 
criminal law enforcement, investigatory records, it is exempted for the 
reasons set forth from the following provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a:
    (1)(c)(3). The release of the disclosure accounting would present a 
serious impediment to law enforcement by permitting the subject of an 
investigation of an actual or potential criminal, civil, or regulatory 
violation to determine whether he is the subject of investigation, or to 
obtain valuable information concerning the nature of that investigation 
and the information obtained, or to identify witnesses and informants.
    (2)(c)(4). Since an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d) of 
the Act (Access to Records), this subsection is inapplicable to the 
extent that this system of records is exempted from subsection (d).
    (3)(d). Access to records contained in this system would enable the 
subject of an investigation of an actual or potential criminal or civil 
case or regulatory violation to determine whether he or she is the 
subject of investigation, to obtain valuable information concerning the 
nature and scope of the investigation, and information or evidence 
obtained as to his/her activities, to identify witnesses and informants, 
or to avoid detection or apprehension.

[[Page 328]]

Such results could prevent the successful completion of the 
investigation, endanger the physical safety of witnesses or informants, 
lead to the improper influencing of witnesses, the destruction of 
evidence, or the fabrication of testimony, and thereby present a serious 
impediment to effective law enforcement. Amendment of the records would 
interfere with ongoing criminal law enforcement proceedings and impose 
an impossible administrative burden by requiring criminal investigations 
to be continuously reinvestigated.
    (4)(e)(1). In the course of criminal or other law enforcement 
investigations, cases, and matters, the Criminal Division will 
occasionally obtain information concerning actual or potential 
violations of law that are not strictly within its statutory or other 
authority, or it may compile information in the course of an 
investigation which may not be relevant to a specific prosecution. In 
the interests of effective law enforcement, it is necessary to retain 
such information since it can aid in establishing patterns of criminal 
activity and can provide valuable leads for Federal and other law 
enforcement agencies.
    (5)(e)(2). To collect information to the greatest extent practicable 
from the subject individual of a criminal investigation or prosecution 
would present a serious impediment to law enforcement. The nature of 
criminal and other investigative activities is such that vital 
information about an individual can only be obtained from other persons 
who are familiar with such individual and his/her activities. In such 
investigations it is not feasible to rely upon information furnished by 
the individual concerning his own activities.
    (6) (e)(3). To provide individuals supplying information with a form 
stating the requirements of subsection (e)(3) would constitute a serious 
impediment to law enforcement in that it could compromise the existence 
of a confidential investigation or reveal the identity of witnesses or 
confidential informants.
    (7)(e)(4) (G) and (H). These subsections are inapplicable to the 
extent that this system is exempt from the access provisions of 
subsection (d) and the rules provisions of subsection (f).
    (8)(e)(4)(I). The categories of sources of the records in this 
system have been published in the Federal Register in broad generic 
terms in the belief that this is all that subsection (e)(4)(I) of the 
Act requires. In the event, however, that this subsection should be 
interpreted to require more detail as to the identity of sources of the 
records in this system, exemption from this provision is necessary to 
protect the confidentiality of the sources of criminal and other law 
enforcement information. Such exemption is further necessary to protect 
the privacy and physical safety of witnesses and informants.
    (9) (e)(5). In the collection of information for criminal law 
enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance what 
information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. With the 
passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may 
acquire new significance as further investigation brings new details to 
light and the accuracy of such information can often only be determined 
in a court of law. The restrictions of subsection (e)(5) would inhibit 
the ability of trained investigators, intelligence analysts, and 
government attorneys in exercising their judgment in reporting on 
information and investigations and impede the development of criminal or 
other intelligence necessary for effective law enforcement.
    (10)(e)(8). The individual notice requirements of subsection (e)(8) 
could present a serious impediment to law enforcement as this could 
interfere with the ability to issue warrants or subpoenas and could 
reveal investigative techniques, procedures, or evidence.
    (11)(f). This subsection is inapplicable to the extent that this 
system is exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d).
    (12)(g). Because some of the records in this system contain 
information which was compiled for law enforcement purposes and have 
been exempted from the access provisions of subsection (d), subsection 
(g) is inapplicable.
    (s) The following system of records is exempted from 5 U.S.C. 
552a(d).


[[Page 329]]


Office of Special Investigations Displaced Persons Listings (JUSTICE/
CRM-027).


This exemption applies to the extent that the records in this system are 
subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2).
    (t) Exemption from subsection (d) is justified for the following 
reasons:
    (1) Access to records contained in this system could inform the 
subject of the identity of witnesses or informants. The release of such 
information could present a serious impediment to effective law 
enforcement by endangering the physical safety of witnesses or 
informants; by leading to the improper influencing of witnesses, the 
destruction of evidence, or the fabrication of testimony; or by 
otherwise preventing the successful completion of an investigation.
    (u) The following system of records is exempted pursuant to the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) and/or (k) from subsections (c)(3) and 
(4); (d)(1), (2), (3), and (4); (e)(1), (2), (3), (5), and (8); and (g) 
of 5 U.S.C. 552a: Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Fusion 
Center System (JUSTICE/CRM-028). These exemptions apply only to the 
extent that information in this system is subject to exemption pursuant 
to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) and/or (k).
    (v) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because to provide the subject with an 
accounting of disclosures of records in this system could inform that 
individual of the existence, nature, or scope of an actual or potential 
law enforcement or counterintelligence investigation by the Organized 
Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Fusion Center or the recipient agency, 
and could permit that individual to take measures to avoid detection or 
apprehension, to learn the identity of witnesses and informants, or to 
destroy evidence, and would therefore present a serious impediment to 
law enforcement or counterintelligence efforts. In addition, disclosure 
of the accounting would amount to notice to the individual of the 
existence of a record. Moreover, release of an accounting may reveal 
information that is properly classified pursuant to Executive Order 
12958 (or successor or prior Executive Order) or a statute and could 
compromise the national defense or foreign policy.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) because this subsection is inapplicable 
to the extent that an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d)(1), 
(2), (3), and (4).
    (3) From subsection (d)(1) because disclosure of records in the 
system could alert the subject of an actual or potential criminal, 
civil, or regulatory violation of the existence of that investigation, 
of the nature and scope of the information and evidence obtained as to 
his activities, of the identity of confidential witnesses and 
informants, of the investigative interest of Organized Crime Drug 
Enforcement Task Force Fusion Center and other intelligence or law 
enforcement agencies (including those responsible for civil proceedings 
related to laws against drug trafficking or related financial crimes); 
lead to the destruction of evidence, improper influencing of witnesses, 
fabrication of testimony, and/or flight of the subject; reveal the 
details of a sensitive investigative or intelligence technique, or the 
identity of a confidential source; or otherwise impede, compromise, or 
interfere with investigative efforts and other related law enforcement 
and/or intelligence activities. In addition, disclosure could invade the 
privacy of third parties and/or endanger the life, health, and physical 
safety of law enforcement personnel, confidential informants, witnesses, 
and potential crime victims. Access to records could also result in the 
release of information properly classified pursuant to Executive Order 
12958 (or successor or prior Executive Order) or by statute, thereby 
compromising the national defense or foreign policy.
    (4) From subsection (d)(2) because amendment of the records thought 
to be incorrect, irrelevant, or untimely would also interfere with 
ongoing investigations, criminal or civil law enforcement proceedings, 
and other law enforcement activities and impose an impossible 
administrative burden by requiring investigations, analyses, and reports 
to be continuously reinvestigated and revised.

[[Page 330]]

    (5) From subsections (d)(3) and (4) because these subsections are 
inapplicable to the extent exemption is claimed from (d)(1) and (2).
    (6) From subsection (e)(1) because, in the course of its 
acquisition, collation, and analysis of information under the statutory 
authority granted to it, the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force 
Fusion Center will occasionally obtain information concerning actual or 
potential violations of law that are not strictly within its statutory 
or other authority or may compile information in the course of an 
investigation which may not be relevant to a specific prosecution. It is 
impossible to determine in advance what information collected during an 
investigation will be important or crucial to the apprehension of 
fugitives. In the interests of effective law enforcement, it is 
necessary to retain such information in this system of records because 
it can aid in establishing patterns of criminal activity and can provide 
valuable leads for federal and other law enforcement agencies. This 
consideration applies equally to information acquired from, or collated 
or analyzed for, both law enforcement agencies and agencies of the U.S. 
foreign intelligence community and military community.
    (7) From subsection (e)(2) because in a criminal, civil, or 
regulatory investigation, prosecution, or proceeding, the requirement 
that information be collected to the greatest extent practicable from 
the subject individual would present a serious impediment to law 
enforcement because the subject of the investigation, prosecution, or 
proceeding would be placed on notice as to the existence and nature of 
the investigation, prosecution, and proceeding and would therefore be 
able to avoid detection or apprehension, to influence witnesses 
improperly, to destroy evidence, or to fabricate testimony. Moreover, 
thorough and effective investigation and prosecution may require seeking 
information from a number of different sources.
    (8) From subsection (e)(3) (to the extent applicable) because the 
requirement that individuals supplying information be provided a form 
stating the requirements of subsection (e)(3) would constitute a serious 
impediment to law enforcement in that it could compromise the existence 
of a confidential investigation or reveal the identity of witnesses or 
confidential informants and endanger their lives, health, and physical 
safety. The individual could seriously interfere with undercover 
investigative techniques and could take appropriate steps to evade the 
investigation or flee a specific area.
    (9) From subsection (e)(5) because the acquisition, collation, and 
analysis of information for law enforcement purposes from various 
agencies does not permit a determination in advance or a prediction of 
what information will be matched with other information and thus whether 
it is accurate, relevant, timely and complete. With the passage of time, 
seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may acquire new 
significance as further investigation brings new details to light and 
the accuracy of such information can often only be determined in a court 
of law. The restrictions imposed by subsection (e)(5) would restrict the 
ability of trained investigators, intelligence analysts, and government 
attorneys to exercise their judgment in collating and analyzing 
information and would impede the development of criminal or other 
intelligence necessary for effective law enforcement.
    (10) From subsection (e)(8) because the individual notice 
requirements of subsection (e)(8) could present a serious impediment to 
law enforcement by revealing investigative techniques, procedures, 
evidence, or interest and interfering with the ability to issue warrants 
or subpoenas, and could give persons sufficient warning to evade 
investigative efforts.
    (11) From subsection (g) because this subsection is inapplicable to 
the extent that the system is exempt from other specific subsections of 
the Privacy Act.
    (12) In addition, exemption is claimed for this system of records 
from compliance with the following provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a pursuant 
to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k): subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), 
to the extent that the records contained in this system are

specifically authorized to be kept secret in the interests of national 
defense and foreign policy.

Sec. 16.92  Exemption of Environment and Natural Resources Division Systems--

limited access.

    (a)(1) The following system of records is exempted pursuant to 5 
U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) from subsections (c)(3) and (4), (d), (e)(1), (e)(2), 
(e)(3), (e)(5), (e)(8), (f) and (g); in addition, the following systems 
of records are exempted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1) and (k)(2) from 
subsections (c)(3), (d), and (e)(1):
    (i) Environment and Natural Resources Division Case and Related 
Files System, JUSTICE/ENRD-003.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (2) These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in 
this system relates to the investigation, prosecution or defense of 
actual or potential criminal or civil litigation, or which has been 
properly classified in the interest of national defense and foreign 
policy, and therefore is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552a(j)(2), (k)(1) and (k)(2). To the extent that information in a 
record pertaining to an individual does not relate to national defense 
or foreign policy, official Federal investigations, and/or law 
enforcement matters, the exemption does not apply. In addition, where 
compliance would not appear to interfere with or adversely affect the 
overall law or regulatory enforcement process, the applicable exemption 
may be waived by the Environment and Natural Resources Division.
    (b) Only that information that relates to the investigation, 
prosecution or defense of actual or potential criminal or civil 
litigation, or which has been properly classified in the interest of 
national defense and foreign policy is exempted for the reasons set 
forth from the following subsections:
    (1) Subsection (c)(3). Subsection (c)(3) requires an agency to 
provide an accounting of disclosures of records concerning an 
individual. To provide the subject of a criminal or civil matter or case 
under investigation with an accounting of disclosures of records would 
inform that individual (and others to whom the subject might disclose 
the records) of the existence, nature, or scope of that investigation 
and thereby seriously impede law enforcement efforts by permitting the 
record subject and others to avoid criminal penalties and civil 
remedies.
    (2) Subsections (c)(4) (requiring an agency to inform individuals 
about any corrections made to a record that has been disclosed) and (g) 
(providing for civil remedies when an agency fails to comply with these 
provisions). These provisions are inapplicable to the extent that this 
system of records is exempted from subsection (d).
    (3) Subsection (d). Subsection (d) requires an agency to allow 
individuals to gain access to a record about him or herself; to dispute 
the accuracy, relevance, timeliness or completeness of such records; and 
to have an opportunity to amend his or her record or seek judicial 
review. To the extent that information contained in this system has been 
properly classified, relates to the investigation and/or prosecution of 
grand jury, civil fraud, and other law enforcement matters, disclosure 
could compromise matters which should be kept secret in the interest of 
national security or foreign policy; compromise confidential 
investigations or proceedings; impede affirmative enforcement actions 
based upon alleged violations of regulations or of civil or criminal 
laws; reveal the identity of confidential sources; and result in 
unwarranted invasions of the privacy of others. Amendment of the records 
would interfere with ongoing criminal law enforcement proceedings and 
impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring criminal 
investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.
    (4) Subsection (e)(1). Subsection (e)(1) requires an agency to 
maintain in its records only such information about an individual that 
is relevant and necessary to accomplish the agency's purpose. In the 
course of criminal or civil investigations, cases, or other matters,

[[Page 332]]

the Environment and Natural Resources Division may obtain information 
concerning the actual or potential violation of laws which are not 
strictly within its statutory authority. In the interest of effective 
law enforcement, it is necessary to retain such information since it may 
establish patterns of criminal activity or avoidance of other civil 
obligations and provide leads for Federal and other law enforcement 
agencies.
    (5) Subsection (e)(2). Subsection (e)(2) requires an agency to 
collect information to the greatest extent practicable from the subject 
individual when the information may result in adverse determinations 
about an individual's rights, benefits and privileges under Federal 
programs. To collect information from the subject of a criminal 
investigation or prosecution would present a serious impediment to law 
enforcement in that the subject (and others with whom the subject might 
be in contact) would be informed of the existence of the investigation 
and would therefore be able to avoid detection or apprehension, to 
influence witnesses improperly, to destroy evidence, or to fabricate 
testimony.
    (6) Subsection (e)(3). Subsection (e)(3) requires an agency to 
inform each individual whom it asks to supply information, on a form 
that can be retained by the individual, the authority which authorizes 
the solicitation, the principal purpose for the information, the routine 
uses of the information, and the effects on the individual of not 
providing the requested information. To comply with this requirement 
during the course of a criminal investigation or prosecution could 
jeopardize the investigation by disclosing the existence of a 
confidential investigation, revealing the identity of witnesses or 
confidential informants, or impeding the information gathering process.
    (7) Subsection (e)(5). Subsection (e)(5) requires an agency to 
maintain records with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and 
completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the 
individual. In compiling information for criminal law enforcement 
purposes, the accuracy, completeness, timeliness and relevancy of the 
information obtained cannot always be immediately determined. As new 
details of an investigation come to light, seemingly irrelevant or 
untimely information may acquire new significance and the accuracy of 
such information can often only be determined in a court of law. 
Compliance with this requirement would therefore restrict the ability of 
government attorneys in exercising their judgment in developing 
information necessary for effective law enforcement.
    (8) Subsection (e)(8). Subsection (e)(8) requires agencies to make 
reasonable efforts to serve notice on an individual when any record on 
the individual is made available to any person under compulsory legal 
process. To serve notice would give persons sufficient warning to evade 
law enforcement efforts.
    (9) Subsections (f) and (g). Subsection (f) requires an agency to 
establish procedures to allow an individual to have access to 
information about him or herself and to contest information kept by an 
agency about him or herself. Subsection (g) provides for civil remedies 
against agencies who fail to comply with the Privacy Act requirements. 
These provisions are inapplicable to the extent that this system is 
exempt from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d).
    (c) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a 
(c)(3) and (d):
    (1) Freedom of Information/Privacy Act Records System. (Justice/LDN-
005).


These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in this 
system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2).
    (d) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c) (3) because that portion of the Freedom of 
Information/Privacy Act Records System that consists of investigatory 
materials compiled for law enforcement purposes is being exempted from 
access and contest; the provision for disclosure of accounting is not 
applicable.
    (2) From subsection (d) because of the need to safeguard the 
identity of confidential informants and avoid interference with ongoing 
investigations or

[[Page 333]]

law enforcement activities by preventing premature disclosure of 
information relating to those efforts.

[Order No. 688-77, 42 FR 10000, Feb. 18, 1977, as amended by Order No. 
207-2000, 65 FR 75158, Dec. 1, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 16.93  Exemption of Tax Division Systems--limited access.

    (a) The following systems of records are exempted pursuant to the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a (j)(2) from subsections (c)(3), (c)(4), 
(d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3), (d)(4), (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3), (e)(4)(G), 
(e)(4)(H), (e)(4)(I), (e)(5), (e)(8), (f) and (g) of 5 U.S.C. 552a:
    (1) Tax Division Central Classification Cards, Index Docket Cards, 
and Associated Records--Criminal Tax Cases (JUSTICE/TAX-001)--Limited 
Access.
    (2) These exemptions apply to the extent that information in these 
systems is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).
    (b) The system of records listed under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section is exempted for the reasons set forth below, from the following 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a:
    (1)(c)(3). The release of the disclosure accounting, for disclosures 
made pursuant to subsection (b) of the Act, including those permitted 
under the routine uses published for those systems of records, would 
enable the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential 
criminal tax case to determine whether he or she is the subject of 
investigation, to obtain valuable information concerning the nature of 
that investigation and the information obtained, and to determine the 
identity of witnesses or informants. Such access to investigative 
information would, accordingly, present a serious impediment to law 
enforcement. In addition, disclosure of the accounting would constitute 
notice to the individual of the existence of a record even though such 
notice requirement under subsection (f)(1) is specifically exempted for 
these systems of records.
    (2)(c)(4). Since an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d) of 
the Act (Access to Records) this subsection is inapplicable to the 
extent that these systems of records are exempted from subsection (d).
    (3) (d)(1); (d)(2); (d)(3); (d)(4). Access to the records contained 
in these systems would inform the subject of an actual or potential 
criminal tax investigation of the existence of that investigation, of 
the nature and scope of the information and evidence obtained as to his 
or her activities, and of the identity of witnesses or informants. Such 
access would, accordingly, provide information that could enable the 
subject to avoid detection, apprehension and prosecution. This result, 
therefore, would constitute a serious impediment to effective law 
enforcement not only because it would prevent the successful completion 
of the investigation but also because it could endanger the physical 
safety of witnesses or informants, lead to the improper influencing of 
witnesses, the destruction of evidence, or the fabrication of testimony.
    (4)(e)(1). The notices for these systems of records published in the 
Federal Register, set forth the basic statutory or related authority for 
maintenance of these systems. However, in the course of criminal tax and 
related law enforcement investigations, cases, and matters, the Tax 
Division will occasionally obtain information concerning actual or 
potential violations of law that may not be technically within its 
statutory or other authority or may compile information in the course of 
an investigation which may not be relevant to a specific prosecution. In 
the interests of effective law enforcement, it is necessary to retain 
some or all of such information in these systems of records since it can 
aid in establishing patterns of criminal activity and can provide 
valuable leads for Federal and other law enforcement agencies.
    (5)(e)(2). In a criminal tax investigation or prosecution, the 
requirement that information be collected to the greatest extent 
practicable from the subject individual would present a serious 
impediment to law enforcement because the subject of the investigation 
or prosecution would be placed on notice as to the existence of the 
investigation and would therefore be able to avoid detection or 
apprehension, influence witnesses improperly, destroy evidence, or 
fabricate testimony.

[[Page 334]]

    (6)(e)(3). The requirement that individuals supplying information be 
provided with a form stating the requirements of subsection (e)(3) would 
constitute a serious impediment to law enforcement in that it could 
compromise the existence of a confidential investigation or reveal the 
identity of witnesses or confidential informants.
    (7)(e)(4) (G) and (H). Since an exemption is being claimed for 
subsections (f) (Agency Rules) and (d) (Access to Records) of the Act 
these subsections are inapplicable to the extent that these systems of 
records are exempted from subsection (f) and (d).
    (8)(e)(4)(I). The categories of sources of the records in the 
systems have been published in the Federal Register in broad generic 
terms in the belief that this is all that subsection (e)(4)(I) of the 
Act requires. In the event, however, that this subsection should be 
interpreted to require more detail as to the identity of sources of the 
records in these systems, exemption from this provision is necessary in 
order to protect the confidentiality of the sources of criminal tax and 
related law enforcement information. Such exemption is further necessary 
to protect the privacy and physical safety of witnesses and informants.
    (9)(e)(5). In the collection of information for criminal tax 
enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance what 
information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. With the 
passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may 
acquire new significance as further investigation brings new details to 
light. Furthermore, the accuracy of such information can often only be 
determined in a court of law. The restrictions of subsection (e)(5) 
would restrict the ability of government attorneys in exercising their 
judgment in reporting on information and investigations and impede the 
development of criminal tax information and related data necessary for 
effective law enforcement.
    (10)(e)(8). The individual notice requirements of subsection (e)(8) 
could present a serious impediment to law enforcement as this could 
interfere with the ability to issue warrants or subpoenas and could 
reveal investigative techniques, procedures, or evidence.
    (11)(f). Procedures for notice to an individual pursuant to 
subsection (f)(1) as to the existence of records pertaining to him 
dealing with an actual or potential criminal tax, civil tax, or 
regulatory investigation or prosecution must be exempted because such 
notice to an individual would be detrimental to the successful conduct 
and/or completion or an investigation or prosecution pending or future. 
In addition, mere notice of the fact of an investigation could inform 
the subject or others that their activities are under or may become the 
subject of an investigation and could enable the subjects to avoid 
detection or apprehension, to influence witnesses improperly, to destroy 
evidence, or to fabricate testimony.
    Since an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d) of the Act 
(Access to Records) the rules required pursuant to subsection (f) (2) 
through (5) are inapplicable to these systems of records to the extent 
that these systems of records are exempted from subsection (d).
    (12)(g). Since an exemption is being claimed for subsections (d) 
(Access to Records) and (f) (Agency Rules) this section is inapplicable, 
and is exempted for the reasons set forth for those subsections, to the 
extent that these systems of records are exempted from subsections (d) 
and (f).
    (c) The following system of records is exempted pursuant to the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) from subsections (c)(3), (d)(1), 
(d)(2), (d)(3), (d)(4), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G, (e)(4)(H, (e)(4)(I) and (f) of 
5 U.S.C. 552a:
    (1) Tax Division Central Classification Cards, Index Docket Cards, 
and Associated Records--Civil Tax Cases (JUSTICE/TAX-002)--Limited 
Access.


These exemptions apply to the extent that information in this system is 
subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2).
    (d) The system of records listed under paragraph (c)(1) is exempted 
for the reasons set forth below, from the following provisions of 5 
U.S.C. 552a:
    (1)(c)(3). The release of the disclosure accounting, for disclosures 
made pursuant to subsection (b) of the Act, including those permitted 
under the routine

[[Page 335]]

uses published for this system of records, would enable the subject of 
an investigation of an actual or potential civil tax case to determine 
whether he or she is the subject of investigation, to obtain valuable 
information concerning the nature of that investigation and the 
information obtained, and to determine the identity of witnesses or 
informants. Such access to investigative information would, accordingly, 
present a serious impediment to law enforcement. In addition, disclosure 
of the accounting would constitute notice to the individual of the 
existence of a record even though such notice requirement under 
subsection (f)(1) is specifically exempted for this system of records.
    (2) (d)(1); (d)(2); (d)(3); (d)(4). Access to the records contained 
in this system would inform the subject of an actual or potential civil 
tax investigation of the existence of that investigation, of the nature 
and scope of the information and evidence obtained as to his or her 
activities and of the identity of witnesses or informants. Such access 
would, accordingly, provide information that could enable the subject to 
avoid detection. This result, therefore, would constitute a serious 
impediment to effective law enforcement not only because it would 
prevent the successful completion of the investigation but also because 
it could endanger the physical safety of witnesses or informants, lead 
to the improper influencing of witnesses, the destruction of evidence, 
or the fabrication of testimony.
    (3)(e)(1). The notices for this system of records published in the 
Federal Register set forth the basic statutory or related authority for 
maintenance of this system. However, in the course of civil tax and 
related law enforcement investigations, cases and matters, the Tax 
Division will occasionally obtain information concerning actual or 
potential violations of law that are not strictly or technically within 
its statutory or other authority or may compile information in the 
course of an investigation which may not be relevant to a specific case. 
In the interests of effective law enforcement, it is necessary to retain 
some or all of such information in this system of records since it can 
aid in establishing patterns of tax compliance and can provide valuable 
leads for Federal and other law enforcement agencies.
    (4)(e)(4) (G) and (H). Since an exemption is being claimed for 
subsections (f) (Agency Rules) and (d) (Access to Records) of the Act 
these subsections are inapplicable to the extent that this system of 
records is exempted from subsection (f) and (d).
    (5)(e)(4)(I). The categories of sources of the records in this 
system have been published in the Federal Register in broad generic 
terms in the belief that this is all that subsection (e)(4)(I) of the 
Act requires. In the event, however, that this subsection should be 
interpreted to require more detail as to the identity of sources of the 
records in this system, exemption from this provision is necessary in 
order to protect the confidentiality of the sources of civil tax and 
related law enforcement information. Such exemption is further necessary 
to protect the privacy and physical safety of witnesses and informants.
    (6)(f). Procedures for notice to an individual pursuant to 
subsection (f)(1) as to existence of records pertaining to the 
individual dealing with an actual or potential criminal tax, civil tax, 
or regulatory investigation or prosecution must be exempted because such 
notice to an individual would be detrimental to the successful conduct 
and/or completion of an investigation or case, pending or future. In 
addition, mere notice of the fact of an investigation could inform the 
subject or others that their activities are under or may become the 
subject of an investigation and could enable the subjects to avoid 
detection, to influence witnesses improperly, to destroy evidence, or to 
fabricate testimony.


Since an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d) of the Act 
(Access to Records) the rules required pursuant to subsection (f) (2) 
through (5) are inapplicable to this system of records to the extent 
that this system of records is exempted from subsection (d).
    (e) The following system of records is exempt from subsections 
(c)(3) and (d)(1) of the Privacy Act pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5): 
Files of Applicants for Attorney and Non-Attorney Positions with the Tax 
Division, Justice/

[[Page 336]]

TAX-003. These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in a 
record is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5).
    (f) Exemption from the particular subsections is justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because an accounting could reveal the 
identity of confidential sources and result in an unwarranted invasion 
of the privacy of others. Many persons are contacted who, without an 
assurance of anonymity, refuse to provide information concerning an 
applicant for a position with the Tax Division. Disclosure of an 
accounting could reveal the identity of a source of information and 
constitutes a breach of the promise of confidentiality by the Tax 
Division. This would result in the reduction in the free flow of 
information vital to a determination of an applicant's qualifications 
and suitability for federal employment.
    (2) From subsection (d)(1) because disclosure of records in the 
system could reveal the identity of confidential sources and result in 
an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of others. Many persons are 
contacted who, without an assurance of anonymity, refuse to provide 
information concerning an applicant for a Tax Division position. Access 
could reveal the identity of the source of the information and 
constitute a breach of the promise of confidentiality on the part of the 
Tax Division. Such breaches ultimately would restrict the free flow of 
information vital to a determination of an applicant's qualifications 
and suitability.

Sec. 16.96  Exemption of Federal Bureau of Investigation Systems--limited 

access.

    (a) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 
552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3), (e)(4)(G) and (H), (e)(5), 
(e)(8), (f) and (g):
    (1) Central Records System (CRS) (JUSTICE/FBI-002).


These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in this 
system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(j) and (k). 
Where compliance would not appear to interfere with or adversely affect 
the overall law enforcement process, the applicable exemption may be 
waived by the FBI.
    (b) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because making available to a record 
subject the accounting of disclosures from records concerning him/her 
would reveal investigative interest by not only the FBI, but also by the 
recipient agency. This would permit the record subject to take 
appropriate measures to impede the investigation, e.g., destroy 
evidence, intimidate potential witnesses or flee the area to avoid the 
thrust of the investigation.
    (2)(i) From subsections (d), (e)(4) (G) and (H), (f) and (g) because 
these provisions concern individual access to investigative records, 
compliance with which could compromise sensitive information classified 
in the interest of national security, interfere with the overall law 
enforcement process by revealing a pending sensitive investigation, 
possibly identify a confidential source or disclose information which 
would constitute an unwarranted invasion of another individual's 
personal privacy, reveal a sensitive investigative technique, or 
constitute a potential danger to the health or safety to law enforcement 
personnel.
    (ii) Also, individual access to non-criminal investigative records, 
e.g., civil investigations and administrative inquiries, as described in 
subsection (k) of the Privacy Act, could also compromise classified 
information related to national security, interfere with a pending 
investigation or internal inquiry, constitute an unwarranted invasion of 
privacy, reveal a confidential source or sensitive investigative 
technique, or pose a potential threat to law enforcement personnel. In 
addition, disclosure of information collected pursuant to an employment 
suitability or similar inquiry could reveal the identity of a source who 
provided information under an express promise of confidentiality, or 
could compromise the objectivity or fairness of a testing or examination 
process.
    (iii) In addition, from paragraph (d)(2) of this section, because to 
require

[[Page 337]]

the FBI to amend information thought to be incorrect, irrelevant or 
untimely, because of the nature of the information collected and the 
essential length of time it is maintained, would create an impossible 
administrative and investigative burden by forcing the agency to 
continuously retrograde its investigations attempting to resolve 
questions of accuracy, etc.
    (3) From subsection (e)(1) because:
    (i) It is not possible in all instances to determine relevancy or 
necessity of specific information in the early stages of a criminal or 
other investigation.
    (ii) Relevance and necessity are questions of judgment and timing; 
what appears relevant and necessary when collected ultimately may be 
deemed unnecessary. It is only after the information is assessed that 
its relevancy and necessity in a specific investigative activity can be 
established.
    (iii) In any investigation the FBI might obtain information 
concerning violations of law not under its jurisdiction, but in the 
interest of effective law enforcement, dissemination will be made to the 
agency charged with enforcing such law.
    (iv) In interviewing individuals or obtaining other forms of 
evidence during an investigation, information could be obtained, the 
nature of which would leave in doubt its relevancy and necessity. Such 
information, however, could be relevant to another investigation or to 
an investigative activity under the jurisdiction of another agency.
    (4) From subsection (e)(2) because the nature of criminal and other 
investigative activities is such that vital information about an 
individual can only be obtained from other persons who are familiar with 
such individual and his/her activities. In such investigations it is not 
feasible to rely upon information furnished by the individual concerning 
his own activities.
    (5) From subsection (e)(3) because disclosure would provide the 
subject with substantial information which could impede or compromise 
the investigation. The individual could seriously interfere with 
undercover investigative activities and could take appropriate steps to 
evade the investigation or flee a specific area.
    (6) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection of information 
for law enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance 
what information is accurate, relevant, timely and complete. With the 
passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may 
acquire new significance as further investigation brings new details to 
light. The restrictions imposed by subsection (e)(5) would limit the 
ability of trained investigators and intelligence analysts to exercise 
their judgment in reporting on investigations and impede the development 
of criminal intelligence necessary for effective law enforcement. In 
addition, because many of these records come from other federal, state, 
local, joint, foreign, tribal, and international agencies, it is 
administratively impossible to ensure compliance with this provision.
    (7) From subsection (e)(8) because the notice requirements of this 
provision could seriously interfere with a law enforcement activity by 
alerting the subject of a criminal or other investigation of existing 
investigative interest.
    (c) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c) 
(3) and (4), (d), (e) (1), (2) and (3), (e)(4) (G) and (H), (e) (5) and 
(8), (f), (g) and (m):
    (1) Electronic Surveillance (Elsur) Indices (JUSTICE/FBI-006).


These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in the system 
is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j).
    (d) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of accounting 
disclosures would place the subject of an investigation on notice that 
he is under investigation and provide him with significant information 
concerning the nature of the investigation, resulting in a serious 
impediment to law enforcement.
    (2) From subsections (c)(4), (d), (e)(4) (G) and (H), and (g) 
because these provisions concern an individual's access to records which 
concern him and such access to records in this system would compromise 
ongoing investigations, reveal investigatory techniques and confidential 
informants, and invade the privacy of private citizens who provide

[[Page 338]]

information in connection with a particular investigation.
    (3) From subsection (e)(1) because these indices must be maintained 
in order to provide the information as described in the ``routine uses'' 
of this particular system.
    (4) From subsections (e) (2) and (3) because compliance is not 
feasible given the subject matter of the indices.
    (5) From subsection (e)(5) because this provision is not applicable 
to the indices in view of the ``routine uses'' of the indices. For 
example, it is impossible to predict when it will be necessary to 
utilize information in the system and, accordingly it is not possible to 
determine when the records are timely.
    (6) From subsection (e)(8) because the notice requirement could 
present a serious impediment to law enforcement by revealing 
investigative techniques, procedures and the existence of confidential 
investigations.
    (7) From subsection (m) for the reasons stated in subsection (b)(7) 
of this section.
    (e) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c) 
(3) and (4), (d), (e) (1), (2) and (3), (e)(4) (G) and (H), (e) (5) and 
(8), (f), and (g):
    (1) Identification Division Records System (JUSTICE/FBI-009).


These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in this 
system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j).
    (f) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) for the reasons stated in subsection 
(d)(1) of this section.
    (2) From subsections (c)(4), (d), (e)(4) (G) and (H), (f) and (g) 
because these provisions concern an individual's access to records which 
concern him. Such access is directed at allowing the subject of a record 
to correct inaccuracies in it. Although an alternate system of access 
has been provided in 28 CFR 16.30 to 34 and 28 CFR 20.34, the vast 
majority of records in this system concern local arrests which it would 
be inappropriate for the FBI to undertake to correct.
    (3) From subsection (e)(1) because it is impossible to state with 
any degree of certainty that all information on these records is 
relevant to accomplish a purpose of the FBI, even though acquisition of 
the records from state and local law enforcement agencies is based on a 
statutory requirement. In view of the number of records in the system it 
is impossible to review them for relevancy.
    (4) From subsection (e)(2) because the records in the system are 
necessarily furnished by criminal justice agencies due to their very 
nature.
    (5) From subsection (e)(3) because compliance is not feasible due to 
the nature of the records.
    (6) From subsection (e)(5) because the vast majority of these 
records come from local criminal justice agencies and it is 
administratively impossible to ensure that the records comply with this 
provision. Submitting agencies are, however, urged on a continuing basis 
to ensure that their records are accurate and include all dispositions.
    (7) From subsection (e)(8) because the FBI has no logical manner to 
ascertain whether process has been made public and compliance with this 
provision would in any case, provide an impediment to law enforcement by 
interfering with the ability to issue warrants or subpoenas and by 
revealing investigative techniques, procedures or evidence.
    (g) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a 
(c)(3) and (4), (d), (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3), (e)(4)(G) and (H), (e)(5), 
(e)(8), (f), and (g):
    (1) National Crime Information Center (NCIC) (JUSTICE/FBI-001). 
These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in the system 
is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and (k)(3).
    (h) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) for the reasons stated in subsection 
(d)(1) of this section.
    (2) From subsections (c)(4), (d), (e)(4) (G) and (H), and (g) for 
the reasons stated in subsection (d)(2) of this section. When records 
are properly subject to access by the individual, an alternate means of 
access is provided in subsection (i) of this section.

[[Page 339]]

    (3) From subsection (e)(1) because information contained in this 
system is primarily from state and local records, and it is for the 
official use of agencies outside the Federal Government in accordance 
with 28 U.S.C. 534.
    (4) From subsections (e) (2) and (3) because it is not feasible to 
comply with these provisions given the nature of this system.
    (5) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection of information 
for law enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance 
what information is accurate, relevant, timely and complete. With the 
passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may 
acquire new significance as further investigation brings new details to 
light. The restrictions imposed by subsection (e)(5) would limit the 
ability of trained investigators and intelligence analysts to exercise 
their judgment in reporting on investigations and impede the development 
of criminal intelligence necessary for effective law enforcement. In 
addition, the vast majority of these records come from other federal, 
state, local, joint, foreign, tribal, and international agencies and it 
is administratively impossible to ensure that the records comply with 
this provision. Submitting agencies are, however, urged on a continuing 
basis to ensure that their records are accurate and include all 
dispositions.
    (6) From subsection (e)(8) for the reasons stated in subsection 
(d)(6) of this section.
    (i) Access to computerized criminal history records in the National 
Crime Information Center is available to the individual who is the 
subject of the record pursuant to procedures and requirements specified 
in the Notice of Systems of Records compiled by the National Archives 
and Records Service and published under the designation:
    (j) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a 
(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G) and (H), (e)(5), (f) and (g):
    (1) National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime (NCAVC) 
(JUSTICE/FBI-015).


These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in this 
system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j)(2) and 
(k)(2).
    (k) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because providing the accounting of 
disclosures to the subject could prematurely reveal investigative 
interest by the FBI and other law enforcement agencies, thereby 
providing the individual an opportunity to impede an active 
investigation, destroy or alter evidence, and possibly render harm to 
violent crime victims and/or witnesses.
    (2) From subsections (d), (e)(4) (G) and (H), and (f) because 
disclosure to the subject could interfere with enforcement proceedings 
of a criminal justice agency, reveal the identity of a confidential 
source, result in an unwarranted invasion of another's privacy, reveal 
the details of a sensitive investigative technique, or endanger the life 
and safety of law enforcement personnel, potential violent crime 
victims, and witnesses. Disclosure also could prevent the future 
apprehension of a violent or exceptionally dangerous criminal fugitive 
should he or she modify his or her method of operation in order to evade 
law enforcement. Also, specifically from subsection (d)(2), which 
permits an individual to request amendment of a record, because the 
nature of the information in the system is such that an individual 
criminal offender would frequently demand amendment of derogatory 
information, forcing the FBI to continuously retrograde its criminal 
investigations in an attempt to resolve questions of accuracy, etc.
    (3) From subsection (g) because the system is exempt from the access 
and amendment provisions of subsection (d).
    (4) From subsection (e)(1) because it is not always possible to 
establish relevance and necessity of the information at the time it is 
obtained or developed. Information, the relevance and necessity of which 
may not be readily apparent, frequently can prove to be of investigative 
value at a later date and time.
    (5) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection of information 
for law enforcement purposes it is impossible

[[Page 340]]

to determine in advance what information is accurate, relevant, timely 
and complete. With the passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely 
information may acquire new significance as further investigation brings 
new details to light. The restrictions imposed by subsection (e)(5) 
would limit the ability of trained investigators and intelligence 
analysts to exercise their judgment in reporting on investigations and 
impede the development of criminal intelligence necessary for effective 
law enforcement. In addition, because many of these records come from 
other federal, state, local, joint, foreign, tribal, and international 
agencies, it is administratively impossible to ensure compliance with 
this provision.
    (l) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a 
(c)(3), (c)(4), (d), (e) (1), (2), and (3), (e)(4) (G) and (H), (e)(5), 
(e)(8), (f) and (g).
    (1) FBI Counterdrug Information Indices System (CIIS) (JUSTICE/FBI--
016)
    (2) [Reserved]
    (m) These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in 
this system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j)(2). 
Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because making available to a record 
subject the accounting of disclosures from records concerning him/her 
would reveal investigative interest by not only the FBI, but also by the 
recipient agency. This would permit the record subject to take 
appropriate measures to impede the investigation, e.g., destroy 
evidence, intimidate potential witnesses or flee the area to avoid the 
thrust of the investigation.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) to the extent it is not applicable 
because an exemption is being claimed from subsection (d).
    (3)(i) From subsections (d), (e)(4) (G) and (H) because these 
provisions concern individual access to records, compliance with which 
could compromise sensitive information, interfere with the overall law 
enforcement process by revealing a pending sensitive investigation, 
possibly identify a confidential source or disclose information which 
would constitute an unwarranted invasion of another individual's 
personal privacy, reveal a sensitive investigative technique, or 
constitute a potential danger to the health or safety of law enforcement 
personnel.
    (ii) In addition, from paragraph (d), because to require the FBI to 
amend information thought to be incorrect, irrelevant or untimely, 
because of the nature of the information collected and the essential 
length of time it is maintained, would create an impossible 
administrative and investigative burden by forcing the agency to 
continuously retrograde its investigations attempting to resolve 
questions of accuracy, etc.
    (4)(i) From subsection (e)(1) because it is not possible in all 
instances to determine relevancy or necessity of specific information in 
the early stages of a criminal or other investigation.
    (ii) Relevance and necessity are questions of judgment and timing; 
what appears relevant and necessary when collected ultimately may be 
deemed otherwise. It is only after the information is assessed that its 
relevancy and necessity in a specified investigative activity can be 
established.
    (iii) In any investigation the FBI might obtain information 
concerning violations of law not under its jurisdiction, but in the 
interest of effective law enforcement, dissemination will be made to the 
agency charged with enforcing such law.
    (iv) In interviewing individuals or obtaining other forms of 
evidence during an investigation, information could be obtained, the 
nature of which would leave in doubt its relevancy and necessity. Such 
information, however, could be relevant to another investigations or to 
an investigative activity under the jurisdiction of another agency.
    (5) From subsection (e)(2) because the nature of criminal and other 
investigative activities is such that vital information about an 
individual often can only be obtained from other persons who are 
familiar with such individual and his/her activities. In such 
investigations it is not feasible to principally rely upon information 
furnished by the individual concerning his own activities.

[[Page 341]]

    (6) From subsection (e)(3) because disclosure would provide the 
subject with information which could impede or compromise the 
investigation. The individual could seriously interfere with undercover 
investigative activities and could take appropriate steps to evade the 
investigation or flee a specific area.
    (7) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection of information 
for law enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance 
what information is accurate, relevant, timely and complete. With the 
passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may 
acquire new significance as further investigation brings new details to 
light. The restrictions imposed by subsection (e)(5) would restrict the 
ability of trained investigators and intelligence analysts to exercise 
their judgment in reporting on investigations and impede the development 
of criminal intelligence necessary for effective law enforcement.
    (8) From subsection (e)(8) because the notice requirements of this 
provision could seriously interfere with a law enforcement activity by 
alerting the subject of a criminal or other investigation of existing 
investigative interest.
    (9) From subsection (f) to the extent that this system is exempt 
from the provisions of subsection (d).
    (10) From subsection (g) to the extent that this system of records 
is exempt from the provisions of subsection (d).
    (n) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a (c) 
(3) and (4); (d); (e) (1), (2), and 3; (e)(4) (G) and (H); (e) (5) and 
(8); and (g):
    (1) National DNA Index System (NDIS) (JUSTICE/FBI-017).
    (2) [Reserved]
    (o) These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in 
the system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2). 
Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because making available the accounting 
of disclosures of records to the subject of the record would prematurely 
place the subject on notice of the investigative interest of law 
enforcement agencies, provide the subject with significant information 
concerning the nature of the investigation, or permit the subject to 
take measures to impede the investigation (e.g., destroy or alter 
evidence, intimidate potential witnesses, or flee the area to avoid 
investigation and prosecution), and result in a serious impediment to 
law enforcement.
    (2)(i) From subsections (c)(4), (d), (e)(4) (G) and (H), and (g) 
because these provisions concern an individual's access to records which 
concern him/her and access to records in this system would compromise 
ongoing investigations. Such access is directed at allowing the subject 
of the record to correct inaccuracies in it. The vast majority of 
records in this system are from the DNA records of local and State NDIS 
agencies which would be inappropriate and not feasible for the FBI to 
undertake to correct. Nevertheless, an alternate method to access and/or 
amend records in this system is available to an individual who is the 
subject of a record pursuant to procedures and requirements specified in 
the Notice of Systems of Records compiled by the National Archives and 
Records Administration and published in the Federal Register under the 
designation: National DNA Index System (NDIS) (JUSTICE/FBI-017)
    (ii) In addition, from paragraph (d)(2) of this section, because to 
require the FBI to amend information thought to be incorrect, 
irrelevant, or untimely, because of the nature of the information 
collected and the essential length of time it is maintained, would 
create an impossible administrative and investigative burden by forcing 
the agency to continuously retrograde investigations attempting to 
resolve questions of accuracy, etc.
    (iii) In addition, from subsection (g) to the extent that the system 
is exempt from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d).
    (3) From subsection (e)(1) because:
    (i) Information in this system is primarily from State and local 
records and it is for the official use of agencies outside the Federal 
Government.
    (ii) It is not possible in all instances to determine the relevancy 
or necessity of specific information in the early stages of the criminal 
investigative process.

[[Page 342]]

    (iii) Relevance and necessity are questions of judgment and timing; 
what appears relevant and necessary when collected ultimately may be 
deemed unnecessary, and vice versa. It is only after the information is 
assessed that its relevancy in a specific investigative activity can be 
established.
    (iv) Although the investigative process could leave in doubt the 
relevancy and necessity of evidence which had been properly obtained, 
the same information could be relevant to another investigation or 
investigative activity under the jurisdiction of the FBI or another law 
enforcement agency.
    (4) From subsections (e)(2) and (3) because it is not feasible to 
comply with these provisions given the nature of this system. Most of 
the records in this system are necessarily furnished by State and local 
criminal justice agencies and not by individuals due to the very nature 
of the records and the system.
    (5) From subsection (e)(5) because the vast majority of these 
records come from State and local criminal justice agencies and because 
it is administratively impossible for them and the FBI to insure that 
the records comply with this provision. Submitting agencies are urged 
and make every effort to insure records are accurate and complete; 
however, since it is not possible to predict when information in the 
indexes of the system (whether submitted by State and local criminal 
justice agencies or generated by the FBI) will be matched with other 
information, it is not possible to determine when most of them are 
relevant or timely.
    (6) From subsection (e)(8) because the FBI has no logical manner to 
determine whenever process has been made public and compliance with this 
provision would provide an impediment to law enforcement by interfering 
with ongoing investigations.
    (p) The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), 
(JUSTICE/FBI-018), a Privacy Act system of records, is exempt:
    (1) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), from subsections (c) (3) and 
(4); (d); (e) (1), (2) and (3); (e)(4) (G) and (H); (e) (5) and (8); and 
(g); and
    (2) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k) (2) and (3), from subsections 
(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), and (e)(4) (G) and (H).
    (q) These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in 
the system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), 
(k)(2), and (k)(3). Exemptions from the particular subsections are 
justified for the following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of the accounting of 
disclosures would place the subject on notice that the subject is or has 
been the subject of investigation and result in a serious impediment to 
law enforcement.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) to the extent that it is not applicable 
since an exemption is claimed from subsection (d).
    (3)(i) From subsections (d) and (e)(4) (G) and (H) because these 
provisions concern an individual's access to records which concern the 
individual and such access to records in the system would compromise 
ongoing investigations, reveal investigatory techniques and confidential 
informants, invade the privacy of persons who provide information in 
connection with a particular investigation, or constitute a potential 
danger to the health or safety of law enforcement personnel.
    (ii) In addition, from subsection (d)(2) because, to require the FBI 
to amend information thought to be not accurate, timely, relevant, and 
complete, because of the nature of the information collected and the 
essential length of time it is maintained, would create an impossible 
administrative burden by forcing the agency to continuously update its 
investigations attempting to resolve these issues.
    (iii) Although the Attorney General is exempting this system from 
subsections (d) and (e)(4) (G) and (H), an alternate method of access 
and correction has been provided in 28 CFR, part 25, subpart A.
    (4) From subsection (e)(1) because it is impossible to state with 
any degree of certainty that all information in these records is 
relevant to accomplish a purpose of the FBI, even though acquisition of 
the records from state and local law enforcement agencies is based on a 
statutory requirement. In view of the number of records in the system, 
it

[[Page 343]]

is impossible to review them for relevancy.
    (5) From subsections (e) (2) and (3) because the purpose of the 
system is to verify information about an individual. It would not be 
realistic to rely on information provided by the individual. In 
addition, much of the information contained in or checked by this system 
is from Federal, State, and local criminal history records.
    (6) From subsection (e)(5) because it is impossible to predict when 
it will be necessary to use the information in the system, and, 
accordingly, it is not possible to determine in advance when the records 
will be timely. Since most of the records are from State and local or 
other Federal agency records, it would be impossible to review all of 
them to verify that they are accurate. In addition, an alternate 
procedure is being established in 28 CFR, part 25, subpart A, so the 
records can be amended if found to be incorrect.
    (7) From subsection (e)(8) because the notice requirement could 
present a serious impediment to law enforcement by revealing 
investigative techniques and confidential investigations.
    (8) From subsection (g) to the extent that, pursuant to subsections 
(j)(2), (k)(2), and (k)(3), the system is exempted from the other 
subsections listed in paragraph (p) of this section.
    (r) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 
552a(c)(3) and (4); (d)(1), (2), (3), and (4); (e)(1), (2), (3), (5), 
and (8); and (g):
    (1) Terrorist Screening Records System (TSRS) (JUSTICE/FBI-019).
    (2) These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in 
this system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), 
(k)(1), and (k)(2). Where compliance would not appear to interfere with 
or adversely affect the counterterrorism purposes of this system, and 
the overall law enforcement process, the applicable exemption may be 
waived by the FBI in its sole discretion.
    (s) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because making available to a record 
subject the accounting of disclosures from records concerning him/her 
would specifically reveal any investigative interest in the individual. 
Revealing this information could reasonably be expected to compromise 
ongoing efforts to investigate a known or suspected terrorist by 
notifying the record subject that he/she is under investigation. This 
information could also permit the record subject to take measures to 
impede the investigation, e.g., destroy evidence, intimidate potential 
witnesses, or flee the area to avoid or impede the investigation. 
Similarly, disclosing this information to individuals who have been 
misidentified as known or suspected terrorists due to a close name 
similarity could reveal the Government's investigative interest in a 
terrorist suspect, because it could make known the name of the 
individual who actually is the subject of the Government's interest. 
Consequently, the Government has as great an interest in protecting the 
confidentiality of identifying information of misidentified persons as 
it does in protecting the confidentiality of the identities of known or 
suspected terrorists.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) because this system is exempt from the 
access and amendment provisions of subsection (d).
    (3) From subsections (d)(1), (2), (3), and (4) because these 
provisions concern individual access to and amendment of records 
contained in this system, which consists of counterterrorism, 
investigatory and intelligence records. Compliance with these provisions 
could alert the subject of a terrorism investigation of the fact and 
nature of the investigation, and/or the investigative interest of the 
FBI and/or other intelligence or law enforcement agencies; compromise 
sensitive information classified in the interest of national security; 
interfere with the overall law enforcement process by leading to the 
destruction of evidence, improper influencing of witnesses, fabrication 
of testimony, and/or flight of the subject; could identify a 
confidential source or disclose information which would constitute an 
unwarranted invasion of another's personal privacy; reveal a sensitive 
investigative or intelligence technique; or constitute a potential 
danger to the health

[[Page 344]]

or safety of law enforcement personnel, confidential informants, and 
witnesses. Amendment of these records would interfere with ongoing 
counterterrorism investigations and analysis activities and impose an 
impossible administrative burden by requiring investigations, analyses, 
and reports to be continuously reinvestigated and revised. Similarly, 
compliance with these provisions with respect to records on individuals 
who have been misidentified as known or suspected terrorists due to a 
close name similarity could reveal the Government's investigative 
interest in a terrorist suspect, because it could make known the name of 
the individual who actually is the subject of the Government's interest.
    (4) From subsection (e)(1) because it is not always possible for TSC 
to know in advance what information is relevant and necessary for it to 
complete an identity comparison between the individual being screened 
and a known or suspected terrorist. Also, because TSC and the FBI may 
not always know what information about an encounter with a known or 
suspected terrorist will be relevant to law enforcement for the purpose 
of conducting an operational response.
    (5) From subsection (e)(2) because application of this provision 
could present a serious impediment to counterterrorism efforts in that 
it would put the subject of an investigation, study or analysis on 
notice of that fact, thereby permitting the subject to engage in conduct 
designed to frustrate or impede that activity. The nature of 
counterterrorism investigations is such that vital information about an 
individual frequently can be obtained only from other persons who are 
familiar with such individual and his/her activities. In such 
investigations it is not feasible to rely upon information furnished by 
the individual concerning his own activities.
    (6) From subsection (e)(3), to the extent that this subsection is 
interpreted to require TSC to provide notice to an individual if TSC 
receives information about that individual from a third party. Should 
the subsection be so interpreted, exemption from this provision is 
necessary to avoid impeding counterterrorism efforts by putting the 
subject of an investigation, study or analysis on notice of that fact, 
thereby permitting the subject to engage in conduct intended to 
frustrate or impede that activity.
    (7) From subsection (e)(5) because many of the records in this 
system are derived from other domestic and foreign agency record systems 
and therefore it is not possible for the FBI and the TSC to vouch for 
their compliance with this provision; however, the TSC has implemented 
internal quality assurance procedures to ensure that TSC terrorist 
screening data is as thorough, accurate, and current as possible. In 
addition, TSC supports but does not conduct investigations; therefore, 
it must be able to collect information related to terrorist identities 
and encounters for distribution to law enforcement and intelligence 
agencies that do conduct terrorism investigations. In the collection of 
information for law enforcement, counterterrorism, and intelligence 
purposes, it is impossible to determine in advance what information is 
accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. With the passage of time, 
seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may acquire new 
significance as further investigation brings new details to light. The 
restrictions imposed by (e)(5) would limit the ability of those 
agencies' trained investigators and intelligence analysts to exercise 
their judgment in conducting investigations and impede the development 
of intelligence necessary for effective law enforcement and 
counterterrorism efforts. The TSC has, however, implemented internal 
quality assurance procedures to ensure that TSC terrorist screening data 
is as thorough, accurate, and current as possible. The FBI also is 
exempting the TSRS from the requirements of subsection (e)(5) in order 
to prevent the use of a challenge under subsection (e)(5) as a 
collateral means to obtain access to records in the TSRS. The FBI has 
exempted TSRS records from the access and amendment requirements of 
subsection (d) of the Privacy Act in order to protect the integrity of 
counterterrorism investigations. Exempting the TSRS from subsection 
(e)(5) serves to prevent the assertion of

[[Page 345]]

challenges to a record's accuracy, timeliness, completeness, and/or 
relevance under subsection (e)(5) to circumvent the exemption claimed 
from subsection (d).
    (8) From subsection (e)(8) because to require individual notice of 
disclosure of information due to compulsory legal process would pose an 
impossible administrative burden on the FBI and the TSC and could alert 
the subjects of counterterrorism, law enforcement, or intelligence 
investigations to the fact of those investigations when not previously 
known.
    (9) From subsection (g) to the extent that the system is exempt from 
other specific subsections of the Privacy Act.

<R05>
Sec. 16.97  Exemption of Bureau of Prisons Systems--limited access.

    (a) The following systems of records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a 
(c) (3) and (4), (d), (e) (2) and (3), (e)(4) (H), (e)(8), (f) and (g):
    (1) Custodial and Security Record System (JUSTICE/BOP-001).
    (2) Industrial Inmate Employment Record System (JUSTICE/BOP-003).
    (3) Inmate Administrative Remedy Record System (JUSTICE/BOP-004).
    (4) Inmate Central Record System (JUSTICE/BOP-005).
    (5) Inmate Commissary Accounts Record System (JUSTICE/BOP-006).
    (6) Inmate Physical and Mental Health Record System (JUSTICE/BOP-
007).
    (7) Inmate Safety and Accident Compensation Record System (JUSTICE/
BOP-008).
    (8) Federal Tort Claims Act Record System (JUSTICE/BOP-009).


These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in these 
systems is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j).
    (b) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because inmates will not be permitted to 
gain access or to contest contents of these record systems under the 
provisions of subsection (d) of 5 U.S.C. 552a. Revealing disclosure 
accountings can compromise legitimate law enforcement activities and 
Bureau of Prisons responsibilities.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) because exemption from provisions of 
subsection (d) will make notification of formal disputes inapplicable.
    (3) From subsection (d) because exemption from this subsection is 
essential to protect internal processes by which Bureau personnel are 
able to formulate decisions and policies with regard to federal 
prisoners, to prevent disclosure of information to federal inmates that 
would jeopardize legitimate correctional interests of security, custody, 
or rehabilitation, and to permit receipt of relevant information from 
other federal agencies, state and local law enforcement agencies, and 
federal and state probation and judicial offices.
    (4) From subsection (e)(2) because primary collection of information 
directly from federal inmates about criminal sentences or criminal 
records is highly impractical and inappropriate.
    (5) From subsection (e)(3) because in view of the Bureau of Prisons' 
responsibilities, application of this provision to its operations and 
collection of information is inappropriate.
    (6) From subsection (e)(4)(H) because exemption from provisions of 
subsection (d) will make publication of agency procedures under this 
subsection inapplicable.
    (7) From subsection (e)(8) because the nature of Bureau of Prisons 
law enforcement activities renders notice of compliance with compulsory 
legal process impractical.
    (8) From subsection (f) because exemption from provisions of 
subsection (d) will render compliance with provisions of this subsection 
inapplicable.
    (9) From subsection (g) because exemption from provisions of 
subsection

[[Page 346]]

(d) will render provisions of this subsection inapplicable.
    (c) The following system of records is exempted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552a(j)(2) from subsections (c)(3) and (4), (d), (e)(1), (2) and (3), 
(e)(5) and (e)(8), and (g). In addition, the following system of records 
is exempted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) from subsections (c)(3), 
(d), and (e)(1):

Bureau of Prisons Access Control Entry/Exit, (JUSTICE/BOP-010).

    (d) These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in 
these systems is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) or 
(k)(2). Where compliance would not appear to interfere with or adversely 
affect the law enforcement process, and/or where it may be appropriate 
to permit individuals to contest the accuracy of the information 
collected, e.g. public source materials, or those supplied by third 
parties, the applicable exemption may be waived, either partially or 
totally, by the BOP. Exemptions from the particular subsections are 
justified for the following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) for similar reasons as those enumerated 
in paragraph (3).
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) to the extent that exemption from 
subsection (d) will make notification of corrections or notations of 
disputes inapplicable.
    (3) From the access provisions of subsection (d) to the extent that 
exemption from this subsection may appear to be necessary to prevent 
access by record subjects to information that may jeopardize the 
legitimate correctional interests of safety, security, and good order of 
Bureau of Prisons facilities; to protect the privacy of third parties; 
and to protect access to relevant information received from third 
parties, such as other Federal State, local and foreign law enforcement 
agencies, Federal and State probation and judicial offices, the 
disclosure of which may permit a record subject to evade apprehension, 
prosecution, etc.; and/or to otherwise protect investigatory or law 
enforcement information, whether received from other third parties, or 
whether developed internally by the BOP.
    (4) From the amendment provisions of subsection (d) because 
amendment of the records would interfere with law enforcement operations 
and impose an impossible administrative burden. In addition to efforts 
to ensure accuracy so as to withstand possible judicial scrutiny, it 
would require that law enforcement and investigatory information be 
continuously reexamined, even where the information may have been 
collected from the record subject. Also, where records are provided by 
other Federal criminal justice agencies or other State, local and 
foreign jurisdictions, it may be administratively impossible to ensure 
compliance with this provision.
    (5) From subsection (e)(1) to the extent that the BOP may collect 
information that may be relevant to the law enforcement operations of 
other agencies. In the interests of overall, effective law enforcement, 
such information should be retained and made available to those agencies 
with relevant responsibilities.
    (6) From subsection (e)(2) because primary collection of information 
directly from the record subject is often highly impractical, 
inappropriate and could result in inaccurate information.
    (7) From subsection (e)(3) because compliance with this subsection 
may impede the collection of information that may be valuable to law 
enforcement interests.
    (8) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection and maintenance 
of information for law enforcement purposes, it is impossible to 
determine in advance what information is accurate, relevant, timely and 
complete. Data which may seem unrelated, irrelevant or incomplete when 
collected may take on added meaning or significance as an investigation 
progresses or with the passage of time, and could be relevant to future 
law enforcement decisions.
    (9) From subsection (e)(8) because the nature of BOP law enforcement 
activities renders notice of compliance with compulsory legal process 
impractical and could seriously jeopardize institution security and 
personal safety and/or impede overall law enforcement efforts.

[[Page 347]]

    (10) From subsection (g) to the extent that the system is exempted 
from subsection (d).
    (e) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a (c) 
(3) and (4), (d), (e) (2) and (3), (e)(5) and (e)(8), (f) and (g):

Telephone Activity Record System (JUSTICE/BOP-011).

    (f) These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in 
this system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j)(2) 
and/or (k)(2). Where compliance would not appear to interfere with or 
adversely affect the law enforcement process, and/or where it may be 
appropriate to permit individuals to contest the accuracy of the 
information collected, the applicable exemption may be waived, either 
partially or totally, by the BOP. Exemptions from the particular 
subsections are justified for the following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) to the extent that this system of records 
is exempt from subsection (d), and for such reasons as those cited for 
subsection (d) in paragraph (f)(3) below.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) to the extent that exemption from 
subsection (d) makes this exemption inapplicable.
    (3) From the access provisions of subsection (d) because exemption 
from this subsection is essential to prevent access of information by 
record subjects that may invade third party privacy; frustrate the 
investigative process; jeopardize the legitimate correctional interests 
of safety, security, and good order to prison facilities; or otherwise 
compromise, impede, or interfere with BOP or other law enforcement 
agency activities.
    (4) From the amendment provisions from subsection (d) because 
amendment of the records may interfere with law enforcement operations 
and would impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring that, 
in addition to efforts to ensure accuracy so as to withstand possible 
judicial scrutiny, it would require that law enforcement information be 
continuously reexamined, even where the information may have been 
collected from the record subject. Also, some of these records come from 
other Federal criminal justice agencies or State, local and foreign 
jurisdictions, or from Federal and State probation and judicial offices, 
and it is administratively impossible to ensure that the records comply 
with this provision.
    (5) From subsection (e)(2) because the nature of criminal and other 
investigative activities is such that vital information about an 
individual can be obtained from other persons who are familiar with such 
individual and his/her activities. In such investigations it is not 
feasible to rely solely upon information furnished by the individual 
concerning his/her own activities since it may result in inaccurate 
information.
    (6) From subsection (e)(3) because in view of BOP's operational 
responsibilities, application of this provision to the collection of 
information is inappropriate. Application of this provision could 
provide the subject with substantial information which may in fact 
impede the information gathering process or compromise an investigation.
    (7) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection and maintenance 
of information for law enforcement purposes, it is impossible to 
determine in advance what information is accurate, relevant, timely and 
complete. Material which may seem unrelated, irrelevant or incomplete 
when collected may take on added meaning or significance at a later date 
or as an investigation progresses. Also, some of these records may come 
from other Federal, State, local and foreign law enforcement agencies, 
and from Federal and State probation and judicial offices and it is 
administratively impossible to ensure that the records comply with this 
provision. It would also require that law enforcement information be 
continuously reexamined even where the information may have been 
collected from the record subject.
    (8) From subsection (e)(8) because the nature of BOP law enforcement 
activities renders impractical the notice of compliance with compulsory 
legal process. This requirement could present a serious impediment to 
law enforcement such as revealing investigative techniques or the 
existence of confidential investigations, jeopardize

[[Page 348]]

the security of third parties, or otherwise compromise law enforcement 
efforts.
    (9)-(10) [Reserved]
    (11) From subsections (f) and (g) to the extent that this system is 
exempt from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d).
    (g) The following system of records is exempt pursuant to the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) from subsections (c) (3) and (4), (d), 
(e) (1), (2), and (3), (e)(5) and (e)(8), and (g) of 5 U.S.C. 552a. In 
addition, the following system of records is exempt pursuant to the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a (k)(1) and (k)(2) from subsections (c)(3), 
(d), and (e)(1) of 5 U.S.C. 552a:

Bureau of Prisons, Office of Internal Affairs Investigative Records, 
JUSTICE/BOP-012

    (h) These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in 
this system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j)(2), 
(k)(1), and (k)(2). Where compliance would not appear to interfere with 
or adversely affect the law enforcement process, and/or where it may be 
appropriate to permit individuals to contest the accuracy of the 
information collected, e.g., public source materials, the applicable 
exemption may be waived, either partially or totally, by the Office of 
Internal Affairs (OIA). Exemptions from the particular subsections are 
justified for the following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because release of disclosure accounting 
could alert the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential 
criminal, civil, or regulatory violation to the existence of the 
investigation and the fact that they are subjects of the investigation, 
and reveal investigative interest by not only the OIA but also by the 
recipient agency. Since release of such information to the subjects of 
an investigation would provide them with significant information 
concerning the nature of the investigation, release could result in 
activities that would impede or compromise law enforcement such as: the 
destruction of documentary evidence; improper influencing of witnesses; 
endangerment of the physical safety of confidential sources, witnesses, 
and law enforcement personnel; fabrication of testimony; and flight of 
the subject from the area. In addition, release of disclosure accounting 
could result in the release of properly classified information which 
could compromise the national defense or disrupt foreign policy.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) because this system is exempt from the 
access provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to subsections (j) and (k) 
of the Privacy Act.
    (3) From the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d) 
because access to the records contained in this system of records could 
provide the subject of an investigation with information concerning law 
enforcement activities such as that relating to an actual or potential 
criminal, civil or regulatory violation; the existence of an 
investigation; the nature and scope of the information and evidence 
obtained as to his activities; the identity of confidential sources, 
witnesses, and law enforcement personnel; and information that may 
enable the subject to avoid detection or apprehension. Such disclosure 
would present a serious impediment to effective law enforcement where 
they prevent the successful completion of the investigation; endanger 
the physical safety of confidential sources, witnesses, and law 
enforcement personnel; and/or lead to the improper influencing of 
witnesses, the destruction of evidence, or the fabrication of testimony. 
In addition, granting access to such information could disclose 
security-sensitive or confidential business information or information 
that would constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of 
third parties. Finally, access to the records could result in the 
release of properly classified information which could compromise the 
national defense or disrupt foreign policy. Amendment of the records 
would interfere with ongoing investigations and law enforcement 
activities and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring 
investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.
    (4) From subsection (e)(1) because the application of this provision 
could impair investigations and interfere with the law enforcement 
responsibilities of the OIA for the following reasons:

[[Page 349]]

    (i) It is not possible to detect relevance or necessity of specific 
information in the early stages of a civil, criminal or other law 
enforcement investigation, case, or matter, including investigations in 
which use is made of properly classified information. Relevance and 
necessity are questions of judgment and timing, and it is only after the 
information is evaluated that the relevance and necessity of such 
information can be established.
    (ii) During the course of any investigation, the OIA may obtain 
information concerning actual or potential violations of laws other than 
those within the scope of its jurisdiction. In the interest of effective 
law enforcement, the OIA should retain this information as it may aid in 
establishing patterns of criminal activity, and can provide valuable 
leads for Federal and other law enforcement agencies.
    (iii) In interviewing individuals or obtaining other forms of 
evidence during an investigation, information may be supplied to an 
investigator which relates to matters incidental to the primary purpose 
of the investigation but which may relate also to matters under the 
investigative jurisdiction of another agency. Such information cannot 
readily be segregated.
    (5) From subsection (e)(2) because, in some instances, the 
application of this provision would present a serious impediment to law 
enforcement for the following reasons:
    (i) The subject of an investigation would be placed on notice as to 
the existence of an investigation and would therefore be able to avoid 
detection or apprehension, to improperly influence witnesses, to destroy 
evidence, or to fabricate testimony.
    (ii) In certain circumstances the subject of an investigation cannot 
be required to provide information to investigators, and information 
relating to a subject's illegal acts, violations of rules of conduct, or 
any other misconduct must be obtained from other sources.
    (iii) In any investigation it is necessary to obtain evidence from a 
variety of sources other than the subject of the investigation in order 
to verify the evidence necessary for successful litigation.
    (6) From subsection (e)(3) because the application of this provision 
would provide the subject of an investigation with substantial 
information which could impede or compromise the investigation. 
Providing such notice to a subject of an investigation could interfere 
with an undercover investigation by revealing its existence, and could 
endanger the physical safety of confidential sources, witnesses, and 
investigators by revealing their identities.
    (7) From subsection (e)(5) because the application of this provision 
would prevent the collection of any data not shown to be accurate, 
relevant, timely, and complete at the moment it is collected. In the 
collection of information for law enforcement purposes, it is impossible 
to determine in advance what information is accurate, relevant, timely, 
and complete. Material which may seem unrelated, irrelevant, or 
incomplete when collected may take on added meaning or significance as 
an investigation progresses. The restrictions of this provision could 
interfere with the preparation of a complete investigation report, and 
thereby impede effective law enforcement.
    (8) From subsection (e)(8) because the application of this provision 
could prematurely reveal an ongoing criminal investigation to the 
subject of the investigation, and could reveal investigation techniques, 
procedures, and/or evidence.
    (9) From subsection (g) to the extent that this system is exempt 
from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to 
subsections (j)(2), (k)(1), and (k)(2) of the Privacy Act.
    (i) Consistent with the legislative purpose of the Privacy Act of 
1974 (Pub. L. 93-579) the BOP has initiated a procedure whereby federal 
inmates in custody may gain access and review their individual prison 
files maintained at the institution of incarceration. Access to these 
files will be limited only to the extent that the disclosure of records 
to the inmate would jeopardize internal decision-making or policy 
determinations essential to the effective operation of the Bureau of 
Prisons; to the extent that disclosure of the records to the inmate 
would jeopardize

[[Page 350]]

privacy rights of others, or a legitimate correctional interest of 
security, custody, or rehabilitation; and to the extent information is 
furnished with a legitimate expectation of confidentiality. The Bureau 
of Prisons will continue to provide access to former inmates under 
existing regulations as is consistent with the interests listed above. 
Under present Bureau of Prisons regulations, inmates in federal 
institutions may file administrative complaints on any subject under the 
control of the Bureau. This would include complaints pertaining to 
information contained in these systems of records.
    (j) The following system of records is exempted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552a(j) from subsections (e)(1) and (e)(5): Bureau of Prisons Inmate 
Central Records System, (Justice/BOP-005).
    (k) These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in 
this system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j). Where 
compliance would not appear to interfere with or adversely affect the 
law enforcement process, and/or where it may be appropriate to permit 
individuals to contest the accuracy of the information collected, e.g. 
public source materials, or those supplied by third parties, the 
applicable exemption may be waived, either partially or totally, by the 
Bureau. Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (e)(1) to the extent that the Bureau may collect 
information that may be relevant to the law enforcement operations of 
other agencies. In the interests of overall, effective law enforcement, 
such information should be retained and made available to those agencies 
with relevant responsibilities.
    (2) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection and maintenance 
of information for law enforcement purposes, it is impossible to 
determine in advance what information is accurate, relevant, timely and 
complete. Data which may seem unrelated, irrelevant or incomplete when 
collected may take on added meaning or significance during the course of 
an investigation or with the passage of time, and could be relevant to 
future law enforcement decisions. In addition, because many of these 
records come from the courts and other state and local criminal justice 
agencies, it is administratively impossible for them and the Bureau to 
ensure compliance with this provision. The restrictions of subsection 
(e)(5) would restrict and delay trained correctional managers from 
timely exercising their judgment in managing the inmate population and 
providing for the safety and security of the prisons and the public.
    (l) The following system of records is exempted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552a(j) from subsections (e)(1) and (e)(5): Bureau of Prisons Inmate 
Trust Fund Accounts and Commissary Record System, (Justice/BOP-006).
    (m) These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in 
this system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j). Where 
compliance would not appear to interfere with or adversely affect the 
law enforcement process, and/or where it may be appropriate to permit 
individuals to contest the accuracy of the information collected, e.g. 
public source materials, or those supplied by third parties, the 
applicable exemption may be waived, either partially or totally, by the 
Bureau. Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (e)(1) to the extent that the Bureau may collect 
information that may be relevant to the law enforcement operations of 
other agencies. In the interests of overall, effective law enforcement, 
such information should be retained and made available to those agencies 
with relevant responsibilities.
    (2) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection and maintenance 
of information for law enforcement purposes, it is impossible to 
determine in advance what information is accurate, relevant, timely and 
complete. Data which may seem unrelated, irrelevant or incomplete when 
collected may take on added meaning or significance as an investigation 
progresses or with the passage of time, and could be relevant to future 
law enforcement decisions. In addition, amendment of the records may 
interfere with law enforcement

[[Page 351]]

operations and would impose an impossible administrative burden by 
requiring that law enforcement information be continuously reexamined, 
even where the information may have been collected from the record 
subject or other criminal justice agencies. The restrictions of 
subsection (e)(5) would restrict and delay trained correctional managers 
from timely exercising their judgment in managing the inmate population 
and providing for the safety and security of the prisons and the public.
    (n) The following system of records is exempted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552a(j) from subsections (e)(1) and (e)(5): Bureau of Prisons Inmate 
Physical and Mental Health Records System, (Justice/BOP-007).
    (o) These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in 
this system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j). Where 
compliance would not appear to interfere with or adversely affect the 
law enforcement process, and/or where it may be appropriate to permit 
individuals to contest the accuracy of the information collected, e.g. 
public source materials, or those supplied by third parties, the 
applicable exemption may be waived, either partially or totally, by the 
Bureau. Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (e)(1) to the extent that the Bureau may collect 
information that may be relevant to the law enforcement operations of 
other agencies. In the interests of overall, effective law enforcement, 
such information should be retained and made available to those agencies 
with relevant responsibilities.
    (2) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection and maintenance 
of information for law enforcement purposes, it is impossible to 
determine in advance what information is accurate, relevant, timely and 
complete. Data which may seem unrelated, irrelevant or incomplete when 
collected may take on added meaning or significance during the course of 
an investigation or with the passage of time, and could be relevant to 
future law enforcement decisions. In addition, because many of these 
records come from sources outside the Bureau of Prisons, it is 
administratively impossible for them and the Bureau to ensure compliance 
with this provision. The restrictions of subsection (e)(5) would 
restrict and delay trained correctional managers from timely exercising 
their judgment in managing the inmate population and providing for the 
health care of the inmates and the safety and security of the prisons 
and the public.
    (p) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a 
(c)(3) and (4), (d)(1)-(4), (e)(2) and (3), (e)(5), and (g):
    Inmate Electronic Message Record System (JUSTICE /BOP-013).
    (q) These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in 
this system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j)(2) 
and/or (k)(2). Where compliance would not appear to interfere with or 
adversely affect the law enforcement process, and/or where it may be 
appropriate to permit individuals to contest the accuracy of the 
information collected, the applicable exemption may be waived, either 
partially or totally, by the BOP. Exemptions from the particular 
subsections are justified for the following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) to the extent that this system of records 
is exempt from subsection (d), and for such reasons as those cited for 
subsection (d) in paragraph (q)(3) below.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) to the extent that exemption from 
subsection (d) makes this exemption inapplicable.
    (3) From the access provisions of subsection (d) because exemption 
from this subsection is essential to prevent access of information by 
record subjects that may invade third party privacy; frustrate the 
investigative process; jeopardize the legitimate correctional interests 
of safety, security and good order to prison facilities; or otherwise 
compromise, impede, or interfere with BOP or other law enforcement 
agency activities.
    (4) From the amendment provisions of subsection (d) because 
amendment of the records may interfere with law enforcement operations 
and would impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring that, 
in addition to efforts to ensure accuracy so as to withstand possible 
judicial scrutiny, it would require that law enforcement information be

[[Page 352]]

continuously reexamined, even where the information may have been 
collected from the record subject. Also, some of these records come from 
other Federal criminal justice agencies or State, local and foreign 
jurisdictions, or from Federal and State probation and judicial offices, 
and it is administratively impossible to ensure that records comply with 
this provision.
    (5) From subsection (e)(2) because the nature of criminal and other 
investigative activities is such that vital information about an 
individual can be obtained from other persons who are familiar with such 
individual and his/her activities. In such investigations it is not 
feasible to rely solely upon information furnished by the individual 
concerning his/her own activities since it may result in inaccurate 
information and compromise ongoing criminal investigations or 
correctional management decisions.
    (6) From subsection (e)(3) because in view of BOP's operational 
responsibilities, application of this provision to the collection of 
information is inappropriate. Application of this provision could 
provide the subject with substantial information which may in fact 
impede the information gathering process or compromise ongoing criminal 
investigations or correctional management decisions.
    (7) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection and maintenance 
of information for law enforcement purposes, it is impossible to 
determine in advance what information is accurate, relevant, timely and 
complete. Material which may seem unrelated, irrelevant or incomplete 
when collected may take on added meaning or significance at a later date 
or as an investigation progresses. Also, some of these records may come 
from other Federal, State, local and foreign law enforcement agencies, 
and from Federal and State probation and judicial offices and it is 
administratively impossible to ensure that the records comply with this 
provision. It would also require that law enforcement information be 
continuously reexamined even where the information may have been 
collected from the record subject.
    (8) From subsection (g) to the extent that this system is exempted 
from other provisions of the Act.

Sec. 16.98  Exemption of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)--limited 

access.

    (a) The following systems of records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 
552a(c)(3) and (d):
    (1) Automated Records and Consummated Orders System/Diversion 
Analysis and Detection System (ARCOS/DADS) (Justice/DEA-003)
    (2) Controlled Substances Act Registration Records (Justice/DEA-005)
    (3) Registration Status/Investigatory Records (Justice/DEA-012)
    (b) These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in 
these systems is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). 
Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because release of the disclosure 
accounting would enable the subject of an investigation to gain valuable 
information concerning the nature and scope of the investigation and 
seriously hamper the regulatory functions of the DEA.
    (2) From subsection (d) because access to records contained in these 
systems may provide the subject of an investigation information that 
could enable him to avoid compliance with the Drug Abuse Prevention and 
Control Act of 1970 (Pub. L. 91-513).
    (c) Systems of records identified in paragraphs (c)(1) through 
(c)(7) below are exempted pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a 
(j)(2) from subsections (c)(3) and (4); (d)(1), (2). (3) and (4); 
(e)(1), (2) and (3), (e)(5), (e)(8); and (g) of 5 U.S.C. 552a. In 
addition, systems of records identified in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), 
(c)(3), (c)(4), (c)(5), and (c)(6) below are also exempted pursuant to 
the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a

[[Page 353]]

(k)(1) from subsections (c)(3); (d)(1), (2), (3) and (4); and (e)(1):
    (1) Air Intelligence Program (Justice/DEA-001)
    (2) Clandestine Laboratory Seizure System (CLSS) (Justice/DEA-002)
    (3) Investigative Reporting and Filing System (Justice/DEA-008)
    (4) Planning and Inspection Division Records (Justice/DEA-010)
    (5) Operation Files (Justice/DEA-011)
    (6) Security Files (Justice/DEA-013)
    (7) System to Retrieve Information from Drug Evidence (STRIDE/
Ballistics) (Justice/DEA-014)
    (d) Exemptions apply to the following systems of records only to the 
extent that information in the systems is subject to exemption pursuant 
to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j)(2), (k)(1), and (k)(2): Air Intelligence Program 
(Justice/DEA-001); Clandestine Laboratory Seizure System (CLSS) 
(Justice/DEA-002); Planning and Inspection Division Records (Justice/
DEA-010); and Security Files (Justice/DEA-013). Exemptions apply to the 
Investigative Reporting and Filing System (Justice/DEA-008) only to the 
extent that information in the system is subject to exemption pursuant 
to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) (2) and (k)(1). Exemptions apply to the Operations 
Files (Justice/DEA-011) only to the extent that information in the 
system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and 
(k)(2). Exemptions apply to the System to Retrieve Information from Drug 
Evidence (STRIDE/Ballistics) (Justice/DEA-014) only to the extent that 
information in the system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552a(j)(2). Exemption from the particular subsections are justified for 
the following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because release of disclosure accounting 
would provide to the subjects of an investigation significant 
information concerning the nature of the investigation and thus would 
present the same impediments to law enforcement as those enumerated in 
paragraph (d)(3) regarding exemption from subsection (d).
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) to the extent that it is not applicable 
because an exemption is being claimed from subsection (d).
    (3) From the access provisions of subsection (d) because access to 
records in this system of records would present a serious impediment to 
law enforcement. Specifically, it could inform the record subject of an 
actual or potential criminal, civil, or regulatory investigation of the 
existence of that investigation; of the nature and scope of the 
information and evidence obtained as to his activities; of the identity 
of confidential sources, witnesses, and law enforcement personnel; and 
of information that may enable the subject to avoid detection or 
apprehension. Similarly, it may alert collateral suspects yet 
unprosecuted in closed cases. It could prevent the successful completion 
of the investigation; endanger the life, health, or physical safety of 
confidential sources, witnesses, and law enforcement personnel, and/or 
lead to the improper influencing of witnesses, the destruction of 
evidence, or the fabrication of testimony; or it may simply reveal a 
sensitive investigative technique. In addition, granting access to such 
information could result in the disclosure of confidential/security-
sensitive or other information that would constitute an unwarranted 
invasion of the personal privacy of third parties. Finally, access to 
the records could result in the release of properly classified 
information which would compromise the national defense or disrupt 
foreign policy. From the amendment provisions of subsection (d) because 
amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing investigations and 
law enforcement activities and impose an impossible administrative 
burden by requiring investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.
    (4) From subsection (e)(1) because the application of this provision 
could impair investigations and interfere with the law enforcement 
responsibilities of the DEA for the following reasons:
    (i) It is not possible to detect relevance or necessity of specific 
information in the early stages of a civil, criminal or other law 
enforcement investigation, case, or matter, including investigations 
during which DEA may obtain properly classified information. Relevance 
and necessity are questions of judgment and timing, and it is only after 
the information is evaluated that the relevance and necessity of such 
information can be established.

[[Page 354]]

    (ii) During the DEA's investigative activities DEA may detect the 
violation of either drug-related or non-drug related laws. In the 
interests of effective law enforcement, it is necessary that DEA retain 
all information obtained because it can aid in establishing patterns of 
activity and provide valuable leads for Federal and other law 
enforcement agencies or otherwise assist such agencies in discharging 
their law enforcement responsibilities. Such information may include 
properly classified information, the retention of which could be in the 
interests of national defense and/or foreign policy.
    (5) From subsection (e)(2) because, in some instances, the 
application of this provision would present a serious impediment to law 
enforcement for the following reasons:
    (i) The subject of an investigation would be placed on notice as to 
the existence of an investigation and would therefore be able to avoid 
detection or apprehension, to improperly influence witnesses, to destroy 
evidence, or to fabricate testimony.
    (ii) In certain circumstances the subject of an investigation cannot 
be required to provide information to investigators, and information 
relating to a subject's illegal acts must be obtained from other 
sources.
    (iii) In any investigation it is necessary to obtain evidence from a 
variety of sources other than the subject of the investigation in order 
to verify the evidence necessary for successful prosecution.
    (6) From subsection (e)(3) because the requirements thereof would 
constitute a serious impediment to law enforcement in that they could 
compromise the existence of an actual or potential confidential 
investigation and/or permit the record subject to speculate on the 
identity of a potential confidential source, and endanger the life, 
health or physical safety or either actual or potential confidential 
informants and witnesses, and of investigators/law enforcement 
personnel. In addition, the notification requirement of subsection 
(e)(3) could impede collection of that information from the record 
subject, making it necessary to collect the information solely from 
third party sources and thereby inhibiting law enforcement efforts.
    (7) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection of information 
for law enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance 
what information is accurate, relevant, timely and complete. With the 
passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may 
acquire new significance as further investigation brings new details to 
light and the accuracy of such information can only be determined in a 
court of law. The restrictions imposed by subsection (e)(5) would 
restrict the ability of trained investigators and intelligence analysts 
to exercise their judgment in reporting on investigations and impede the 
development of criminal intelligence necessary for effective law 
enforcement.
    (8) From subsection (e)(8) because the application of this provision 
could prematurely reveal an ongoing criminal investigation to the 
subject of the investigation, and could reveal investigative techniques, 
procedures, or evidence.
    (9) From subsection (g) to the extent that this system is exempt 
from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to 
subsections (j)(2), (k)(1) and (k)(2) of the Privacy Act.
    (e) The following systems of records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a 
(d)(1) and (e)(1):
    (1) Grants of Confidentiality Files (GCF) (Justice/DEA-017), and
    (2) DEA Applicant Investigations (Justice/DEA-018).
    (f) These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in 
these systems is subject to exception pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5). 
Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (d)(1) because many persons are contacted who, 
without an assurance of anonymity, refuse to provide information 
concerning an applicant for a grant of confidentiality with DEA. By 
permitting access to information which may reveal the identity of the 
source of that information--after a promise of confidentiality has been 
given--DEA would breach the promised confidentiality. Ultimately, such 
breaches would restrict the free

[[Page 355]]

flow of information which is vital to a determination of an applicant's 
qualifications for a grant.
    (2) From subsection (e)(1) because in the collection of information 
for investigative and evaluation purposes, it is impossible to determine 
in advance what exact information may be of assistance in determining 
the qualifications and suitability of a candidate. Information which may 
appear irrelevant, when combined with other apparently irrelevant 
information, can on occasion provide a composite picture of an applicant 
which assists in determining whether a grant of confidentiality is 
warranted.

Sec. 16.99  Exemption of the Immigration and Naturalization Service Systems-

limited access.

    (a) The following systems of records of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a (c) (3) and (4), 
(d), (e) (1), (2) and (3), (e) (4)(G) and (H), (e) (5) and (8), and (g):
    (1) The Immigration and Naturalization Service Alien File (A-File) 
and Central Index System (CIS), JUSTICE/INS-001A.
    (2) The Immigration and Naturalization Service Index System, 
JUSTICE/INS-001 which consists of the following subsystems:
    (i) Agency Information Control Record Index.
    (ii) Alien Enemy Index.
    (iii) Congressional Mail Unit Index.
    (iv) Air Detail Office Index.
    (v) Anti-smuggling Index (general).
    (vi) Anti-smuggling Information Centers Systems for Canadian and 
Mexican Borders.
    (vii) Border Patrol Sectors General Index System.
    (viii) Contact Index.
    (ix) Criminal, Narcotic, Racketeer and Subversive Indexes.
    (x) Enforcement Correspondence Control Index System.
    (xi) Document Vendors and Alterers Index.
    (xii) Informant Index.
    (xiii) Suspect Third Party Index.
    (xiv) Examination Correspondence Control Index.
    (xv) Extension Training Enrollee Index.
    (xvi) Intelligence Index.
    (xvii) Naturalization and Citizenship Indexes.
    (xviii) Personnel Investigations Unit Indexes.
    (xix) Service Look-Out Subsystem.
    (xx) White House and Attorney General Correspondence Control Index.
    (xxi) Fraudulent Document Center Index.
    (xxii) Emergency Reassignment Index.
    (xxiii) Alien Documentation, Identification, and Telecommunication 
(ADIT) System.


The exemptions apply to the extent that information in these subsystems 
is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j)(2) and (k)(2).
    (3) The Immigration and Naturalization Service ``National Automated 
Immigration Lookout System (NAILS) JUSTICE/INS-032.'' The exemptions 
apply only to the extent that records in the system are subject to 
exemptions pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and (k)(2).
    (b) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of the disclosure 
accounting for disclosure pursuant to the routine uses published for 
these subsystems would permit the subject of a criminal or civil 
investigation to obtain valuable information concerning the nature of 
that investigation and present a serious impediment to law enforcement.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) since an exemption is being claimed for 
subsection (d), this subsection will not be applicable.
    (3) From subsection (d) because access to the records contained in 
these subsystems would inform the subject of a criminal or civil 
investigation of the existence of that investigation, provide the 
subject of the investigation with information that might enable him to 
avoid detection or apprehension, and present a serious impediment to law 
enforcement.

[[Page 356]]

    (4) From subsection (e)(1) because in the course of criminal or 
civil investigations, the Immigration and Naturalization Service often 
obtains information concerning the violation of laws other than those 
relating to violations over which INS has investigative jurisdiction. In 
the interests of effective law enforcement, it is necessary that INS 
retain this information since it can aid in establishing patterns of 
criminal activity and provide valuable leads for those law enforcement 
agencies that are charged with enforcing other segments of the criminal 
law.
    (5) From subsection (e)(2) because in a criminal or civil 
investigation, the requirement that information be collected to the 
greatest extent possible from the subject individual would present a 
serious impediment to law enforcement in that the subject of the 
investigation would be placed on notice of the existence of the 
investigation and would therefore be able to avoid detection or 
apprehension.
    (6) From subsection (e)(3) because the requirement that individuals 
supplying information be provided with a form stating the requirements 
of subsection (e)(3) would constitute a serious impediment to law 
enforcement in that it could compromise the existence of a confidential 
investigation, reveal the identity of confidential sources of 
information and endanger the life or physical safety of confidential 
informants.
    (7) From subsections (e)(4) (G) and (H) because these subsystems of 
records are exempt from individual access pursuant to subsection (j) of 
the Privacy Act of 1974.
    (8) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection of information 
for law enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance 
what information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. With the 
passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may 
acquire new significance as further investigation brings new details to 
light and the accuracy of such information can only be determined in a 
court of law. The restrictions of subsection (e)(5) would restrict the 
ability of trained investigators and intelligence analysts to exercise 
their judgment in reporting on investigations and impede the development 
of criminal intelligence necessary for effective law enforcement.
    (9) From subsection (e)(8) because the individual notice 
requirements of subsection (e)(8) could present a serious impediment to 
law enforcement as this could interfere with the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service's ability to issue administrative subpoenas and 
could reveal investigative techniques and procedures.
    (10) From subsection (g) because these subsystems of records are 
compiled for law enforcement purposes and have been exempted from the 
access provisions of subsections (d) and (f).
    (11) In addition, these systems of records are exempt from 
subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G) and (H) to the extent they 
are subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1). To permit 
access to records classified pursuant to Executive Order would violate 
the Executive Order protecting classified information.
    (c) The Border Patrol Academy Index Subsystem is exempt from 5 
U.S.C. 552a (d) and (f).

This exemption applies only to the extent that information in this 
subsystem is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k).
    (d) Exemptions for the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons.
    (1) From subsection (d) because exemption is claimed only for those 
testing and examination materials used to determine an individual's 
qualifications for retention and promotion in the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. This is necessary to protect the integrity of 
testing materials and to insure fair and uniform examinations.
    (2) From subsection (f) because the subsystem of records has been 
exempted from the access provisions of subsection (d).
    (e) The Orphan Petitioner Index and Files (Justice/INS-007) system 
of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(d). This exemption applies only 
to the extent that information in this system is subject to exemption 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1).
    (f) Exemption from paragraph (d) of this section is claimed solely 
because

[[Page 357]]

of the possibility of receipt of classified information during the 
course of INS investigation of prospective adoptive parents.

Although it would be rare, prospective adoptive parents may originally 
be from foreign countries (for example) and information received on them 
from their native countries may require classification under Executive 
Order 12356 which safeguards national security information. If such 
information is relevant to the INS determination with respect to 
adoption, the information would be kept in the file and would be 
classified accordingly. Therefore, access could not be granted to the 
record subject under the Privacy Act without violating E.O. 12356.
    (g) The Office of Internal Audit Investigations Index and Records 
(Justice/INS-002) system of records is exempt under the provisions of 5 
U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) from subsections (c)(3) and (4); (d); (e)(1), (2), 
(3), (5) and (8); and (g), but only to the extent that this system 
contains records within the scope of subsection (j)(2), and to the 
extent that records in the system are subject to exemption therefrom. In 
addition, this system of records is also exempt under the provisions of 
5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) from subsections (c)(3); (d); and (e)(1), but only 
to the extent that this system contains records within the scope of 
subsection (k)(2), and to the extent that records in the system are 
subject to exemption therefrom.
    (h) The following justification apply to the exemptions from 
particular subsections:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of the disclosure 
accounting for disclosure could permit the subject of an actual or 
potential criminal or civil investigation to obtain valuable information 
concerning the existence and nature of the investigation, the fact that 
individuals are subjects of the investigation, and present a serious 
impediment to law enforcement.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) to the extent that the exemption from 
subsection (d) is applicable. Subsection (c)(4) will not be applicable 
to the extent that records in the system are properly withholdable under 
subsection (d).
    (3) From the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d) 
because access to the records contained in this system of records could 
inform the subject of a criminal or civil investigation of the existence 
of that investigation; of the nature and scope of the information and 
evidence obtained as to their activities; of the identity of 
confidential sources, witnesses and law enforcement personnel; and of 
information that may enable the subject to avoid detection or 
apprehension. Such disclosures would present a serious impediment to 
effective law enforcement where they prevent the successful completion 
of the investigation; endanger the physical safety of confidential 
sources, witnesses, and law enforcement personnel; and/or lead to the 
improper influencing of witnesses, the destruction of evidence, or the 
fabrication of testimony. In addition, granting access to these records 
could result in a disclosure that would constitute an unwarranted 
invasion of the privacy of third parties. Amendment of the records would 
interfere with ongoing investigations and law enforcement activities and 
impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring investigations 
to be continuously reinvestigated.
    (4) From subsection (e)(1) because in the course of criminal or 
civil investigations, the Immigration and Naturalization Service often 
obtains information concerning the violation of laws other than those 
relating to violations over which INS has investigative jurisdiction, in 
the interests of effective law enforcement, it is necessary that INS 
retain this information since it can aid in establishing patterns of 
criminal activity and provide valuable leads for those law enforcement 
agencies that are charged with enforcing other segments of the criminal 
law.
    (5) From subsection (e)(2) because in a criminal investigation, the 
requirement that information be collected to the greatest extent 
possible from the subject individual would present a serious impediment 
to law enforcement in that the subject of the investigation would be 
placed on notice of the existence of the investigation and would 
therefore be able to avoid detection or apprehension.

[[Page 358]]

    (6) From subsection (e)(3) because the requirement that individuals 
supplying information be provided with a form stating the requirements 
of subsection (e)(3) would constitute a serious impediment of criminal 
law enforcement in that it could compromise the existence of a 
confidential investigation, reveal the identify of confidential sources 
of information and endanger the life or physical safety of confidential 
informants.
    (7) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection of information 
for criminal law enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in 
advance what information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. 
With the passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information 
may acquire new significance as further investigation brings new details 
to light and the accuracy of such information can only be determined in 
a court of law. The restrictions of subsection (e)(5) would restrict the 
ability of trained investigators and intelligence analysts to exercise 
their judgment in reporting on investigations and impede the development 
of criminal intelligence necessary for effective law enforcement.
    (8) From subsection (e)(8) because the individual notice 
requirements of subsection (e)(8) could present a serious impediment to 
criminal law enforcement as this could interfere with the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service's ability to issue administrative subpoenas 
and could reveal investigative techniques and procedures.
    (9) From subsection (g) for those portions of this system of records 
that were compiled for criminal law enforcement purposes and which are 
subject to exemption from the access provisions of subsections (d) 
pursuant to subsection (j)(2).
    (i) The Law Enforcement Support Center Database (LESC) (Justice/INS-
023) system of records is exempt under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 
552a(j)(2) from subsections (c) (3) and (4); (d); (e) (1), (2), (3), 
(5), (8) and (g); but only to the extent that this system contains 
records within the scope of subsection (j)(2), and to the extent that 
records in the system are subject to exemption therefrom. In addition, 
this system of records is also exempt in part under the provisions of 5 
U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) from subsections (c)(3); (d); and (e)(1), but only to 
the extent that this system contains records within the scope of 
subsection (k)(2), and to the extent that records in the system are 
subject to exemption therefrom.
    (j) The following justifications apply to the exemptions from 
particular subsections:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) for reasons stated in paragraph (h)(1) of 
this section.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) for reasons stated in paragraph (h)(2) of 
this section.
    (3) From the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d) 
because access to the records contained in this system of records could 
inform the subject of a criminal or civil investigation of the existence 
of that investigation; of the nature and scope of the information and 
evidence obtained as to their activities; and of information that may 
enable the subject to avoid detection or apprehension. Such disclosures 
would present a serious impediment to effective law enforcement where 
they prevent the successful completion of the investigation or other law 
enforcement operation such as deportation or exclusion. In addition, 
granting access to these records could result in a disclosure that would 
constitute an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of third parties. 
Amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing investigations and 
law enforcement activities and impose an impossible administrative 
burden by requiring investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.
    (4) From subsection (e)(1) for reasons stated in paragraph (h)(4) of 
this section.
    (5) From subsection (e)(2) for reasons stated in paragraph (h)(5) of 
this section.
    (6) From subsection (e)(3) because the requirement that individuals 
supplying information be provided with a form stating the requirements 
of subsection (e)(3) would constitute a serious impediment to criminal 
law enforcement in that it could compromise the existence of a 
confidential investigation.

Sec. 16.100  Exemption of Office of Justice Programs--limited access.

    (a) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(d):
    (1) The Civil Rights Investigative System (JUSTICE/OJP-008).


This exemption applies only to the extent that information in this 
system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2).
    (b) Exemption from subsection (d) is claimed since access to 
information in the Civil Rights Investigative System prior to final 
administrative resolution will deter conciliation and compliance 
efforts. Consistent with the legislative purpose of the Privacy Act of 
1974, decisions to release information from the system will be made on a 
case-by-case basis and information will be made available where it does 
not compromise the complaint and compliance process. In addition, where 
explicit promises of confidentiality must be made to a source during an 
investigation, disclosure will be limited to the extent that the 
identity of such confidential sources will not be compromised.

<R05>
Sec. 16.101  Exemption of U.S. Marshals Service Systems--limited access, as 

indicated.

    (a) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 
552(a)(c) (3) and (4), (d), (e) (1), (2) and (3), (e)(4) (G) and (H), 
(e)(5), (e)(8), (f) and (g):
    (1) Warrant Information System (JUSTICE/USM-007).


These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in this 
system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).
    (b) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of disclosure 
accounting for disclosure made pursuant to subsection (b) of the Act, 
including those permitted under routine uses published for this system 
of records would permit a person to determine whether he is the subject 
of a criminal investigation, and to determine whether a warrant has been 
issued against him, and therefore present a serious impediment to law 
enforcement.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) since an exemption is being claimed for 
subsection (d) of the Act, this section is inapplicable.
    (3) From subsection (d) because access to records would inform a 
person for whom a federal warrant has been issued of the nature and 
scope of information obtained as to his activities, of the identity of 
informants, and afford the person sufficient information to enable the 
subject to avoid apprehension. These factors would present a serious 
impediment to law enforcement in that they would thwart the warrant 
process and endanger lives of informants etc.
    (4) From subsections (e)(1) and (e)(5) because the requirements of 
these subsections would present a serious impediment to law enforcement 
in that it is impossible to determine in advance what information 
collected during an investigation will be important or crucial to the 
apprehension of Federal fugitives. In the interest of effective law 
enforcement, it is appropriate in a thorough investigation to retain 
seemingly irrelevant, untimely, or inaccurate information which, with 
the passage of time, would aid in establishing patterns of activity and 
provide investigative leads toward fugitive apprehension and assist in 
law enforcement activities of other agencies.
    (5) From subsection (e)(2) because the requirement that information 
be collected to the greatest extent practical from the subject 
individual would present a serious impediment to law enforcement because 
the subject of the

[[Page 361]]

investigation or prosecution would be placed on notice as to the 
existence of the warrant and would therefore be able to avoid detection 
or apprehension.
    (6) From subsection (e)(3) because the requirement that individuals 
supplying information be provided with a form stating the requirements 
of subsection (e)(3) would constitute a serious impediment to law 
enforcement in that it could compromise the existence of a confidential 
investigation or reveal identity of confidential informants.
    (7) From subsections (e)(4) (G) and (H) since an exemption is being 
claimed for subsections (f) and (d) of the Act, these subsections are 
inapplicable.
    (8) From subsection (e)(8) because the individual notice requirement 
of this subsection would present a serious impediment to law enforcement 
in that it would give persons sufficient warning to avoid warrants, 
subpoena, etc.
    (9) From subsection (f) because procedures for notice to an 
individual pursuant to subsection (f)(1) as to existence of records 
pertaining to him dealing with warrants must be exempted because such 
notice to individuals would be detrimental to the successful service of 
a warrant. Since an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d) of the 
Act the rules required pursuant to subsections (f) (2) through (5) are 
inapplicable to this system of records.
    (10) From subsection (g) since an exemption is being claimed for 
subsection (d) and (f) this section is inapplicable and is exempted for 
the reasons set forth for these subsections.
    (c) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a (c) 
(3) and (4), (d), (e) (2) and (3), (e)(4) (G) and (H), (e)(8), (f)(2) 
and (g):
    (1) Witness Security System (JUSTICE/USM-008).


These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in this 
system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).
    (d) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of the disclosure 
accounting for disclosures made pursuant to subsection (b) of the Act 
including those permitted under routine uses published for this system 
of records would hamper the effective functioning of the Witness 
Security Program which by its very nature requires strict 
confidentiality vis-a-vis the records.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) for the reason stated in (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (3) From subsection (d) because the U.S. Marshals Service Witness 
Security Program aids efforts of law enforcement officials to prevent, 
control or reduce crime. Access to records would present a serious 
impediment to effective law enforcement through revelation of 
confidential sources and through disclosure of operating procedures of 
the program, and through increased exposure of the program to the 
public.
    (4) From subsection (e)(2) because in the Witness Security Program 
the requirement that information be collected to the greatest extent 
possible from the subject individual would constitute an impediment to 
the program, which is sometimes dependent on sources other than the 
subject witness for verification of information pertaining to the 
witness.
    (5) From subsection (e)(3) for the reason stated in (b)(6) of this 
section.
    (6) From subsection (e)(4) (G) and (H) for the reason stated in 
(b)(7) of this section.
    (7) From subsection (e)(8) for the reason stated in (b)(8) of this 
section.
    (8) From subsection (f)(2) since an exemption is being claimed for 
subsection (d) of the Act the rules required pursuant to subsection (f) 
(2) through (5) are inapplicable to this system of records.
    (9) From subsection (g) for the reason stated in (b)(10) of this 
section.
    (e) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 
552a(c)(3) and (4), (d), (e)(1), (2) and (3), (e)(4)(G) and (H), (e)(5), 
(e)(8), (f) and (g).
    (1) Internal Affairs System (JUSTICE/USM-002)--Limited access. These 
exemptions apply only to the extent that information in this system is 
subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), (k)(2) or (k)(5). 
Where compliance would not interfere with or adversely affect the law 
enforcement process, the USMS may waive the exemptions, either partially 
or totally.

[[Page 362]]

    (f) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsections (c)(3) and (d) to the extent that release of 
the disclosure accounting may impede or interfere with civil or criminal 
law enforcement efforts, reveal a source who furnished information to 
the Government in confidence, and/or result in an unwarranted invasion 
of the personal privacy of collateral record subjects or other third 
party individuals.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) for the reason stated in (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (3) From subsection (e)(1) to the extent that it is necessary to 
retain all information in order not to impede, compromise, or interfere 
with civil or criminal law enforcement efforts, e.g., where the 
significance of the information may not be readily determined and/or 
where such information may provide leads or assistance to Federal and 
other law agencies in discharging their law enforcement 
responsibilities.
    (4) From subsection (e)(2) because the requirement that information 
be collected to the greatest extent practicable from the subject 
individual would present a serious impediment to law enforcement because 
the subject of the investigation or prosecution would be placed on 
notice as to the existence of the investigation and would therefore be 
able to compromise the investigation and avoid detection or 
apprehension.
    (5) From subsection (e)(3) for the reason stated in (b)(6) of this 
section.
    (6) From subsections (e)(4) (G) and (H) for the reason stated in 
(b)(7) of this section.
    (7) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection of information 
for law enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance 
what information is accurate, relevant, timely and complete. With the 
passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may 
acquire new significance and the accuracy of such information can only 
be determined in a court of law. The restrictions imposed by subsection 
(e)(5) would restrict the ability to collect information for law 
enforcement purposes and interfere with the preparation of a complete 
investigative report or otherwise impede effective law enforcement.
    (8) From subsection (e)(8) because the individual notice requirement 
of this subsection would present a serious impediment to law enforcement 
in that the subject of the investigation would be alerted as to the 
existence of the investigation and therefore be able to compromise the 
investigation and avoid detection, subpoena, etc.
    (9) From subsection (f) because procedures for notice to an 
individual pursuant to subsection (f)(1) as to the existence of records 
dealing with investigations of criminal or civil law violations would 
enable the individual to compromise the investigation and evade 
detection or apprehension. Since an exemption is being claimed for 
subsection (d) of the Act, the rules required pursuant to subsections 
(f)(2) through (f)(5) are not applicable to this system.
    (10) From subsection (g) for the reason stated in (b)(10) of this 
section.
    (g) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c) 
(3) and (4), (d), (e)(1), (2) and (3), (e)(4) (G) and (H), (e)(5), 
(e)(8), (f) and (g):
    (1) U.S. Marshals Service Threat Analysis Information System 
(JUSTICE/USM-009).


These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in this 
system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).
    (h) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because to release the disclosure 
accounting would permit a person to determine whether he or she has been 
identified as a specific threat to USMS protectees and to determine the 
need for countermeasures to USMS protective activities and thereby 
present a serious impediment to law enforcement.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) because it is inapplicable since an 
exemption is being claimed for subsection (d).
    (3) From subsection (d) because to permit access to records would 
inform a person of the nature and scope of information obtained as to 
his or her threat-related activities and of the identity of confidential 
sources, and afford the person sufficient information

[[Page 363]]

to develop countermeasures to thwart protective arrangements and 
endanger lives of USMS protectees, informants, etc. To permit amendment 
of the records would interfere with ongoing criminal law enforcement and 
impose an impossible administrative burden requiring criminal 
investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.
    (4) From subsections (e) (1) and (5) because the collection of 
investigatory information used to assess the existence, extent and 
likelihood of a threat situation necessarily includes material from 
which it is impossible to identify and segregate information which may 
not be important to the conduct of a thorough assessment. It is often 
impossible to determine in advance if all information collected is 
accurate, relevant, timely and complete but, in the interests of 
developing effective protective measures, it is necessary that the U.S. 
Marshals Service retain this information in order to establish patterns 
of activity to aid in accurately assessing threat situations. The 
restrictions of subsections (e) (1) and (5) would impede the protective 
responsibilities of the Service and could result in death or serious 
injury to Marshals Service protectees.
    (5) From subsection (e)(2) because to collect information from the 
subject individual would serve notice that he or she is identified as a 
specific threat to USMS protectees and would enable the subject 
individual to develop countermeasures to protective activities and 
thereby present a serious impediment to law enforcement.
    (6) From subsection (e)(3) because to inform individuals as required 
by this subsection would enable the subject individual to develop 
countermeasures to USMS protective arrangements or identify confidential 
sources and thereby present a serious impediment to law enforcement.
    (7) From subsections (e)(4) (G) and (H) because they are 
inapplicable since an exemption is being claimed for subsections (d) and 
(f) of the Act.
    (8) From subsection (e)(8) because to serve notice would give 
persons sufficient warning to develop countermeasures to protective 
arrangements and thereby present a serious impediment to law enforcement 
through compromise of protective procedures, etc.
    (9) From subsection (f) because this system of records is exempt 
from the provisions of subsection (d).
    (10) From subsection (g) because it is inapplicable since an 
exemption is being claimed for subsections (d) and (f).
    (i) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c) 
(3) and (d):
    (1) Judicial Facility Security Index System (JUSTICE/USM-010)


These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in this 
system is exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5).
    (j) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) only to the extent that release of the 
disclosure accounting would reveal the identity of a confidential 
source.
    (2) From subsection (d) only to the extent that access to 
information would reveal the identity of a confidential source.
    (k) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c) 
(3) and (4), (d), (e)(1), (2) and (3), (e)(4) (G) and (H), (e)(5), 
(e)(8), (f) and (g):
    (1) U.S. Marshals Service Freedom of Information/Privacy Act (FOIA/
PA) Files (JUSTICE/USM-012).


These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in this 
system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j)(2), (k)(2) 
and (k)(5).
    (l) Because this system contains Department of Justice civil and 
criminal law enforcement, investigatory records, exemptions from the 
particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because to release the disclosure 
accounting would permit the subject of an investigation to obtain 
valuable information concerning the existence and nature of the 
investigation and present a serious impediment to law enforcement.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) because that portion of this system which 
consists of investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes 
is being exempted from the provisions of subsection (d), rendering this 
provision not applicable.

[[Page 364]]

    (3) From subsection (d) because to permit access to investigatory 
records would reveal the identity of confidential sources and impede 
ongoing investigative or law enforcement activities by the premature 
disclosure of information related to those efforts. To permit amendment 
of the records would interfere with ongoing criminal law enforcement and 
impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring criminal 
investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.
    (4) From subsections (e) (1) and (5) because it is often impossible 
to determine in advance if investigatory records contained in this 
system are accurate, relevant, timely and complete but, in the interests 
of effective law enforcement, it is necessary to retain this information 
to aid in establishing patterns of activity and provide leads in 
criminal investigations.
    (5) From subsection (e)(2) because to collect information from the 
subject individual would serve notice that he or she is the subject of 
criminal investigative or law enforcement activity and thereby present a 
serious impediment to law enforcement.
    (6) From subsection (e)(3) because to inform individuals as required 
by this subsection would enable the subject individual to identify 
confidential sources, reveal the existence of an investigation, and 
compromise law enforcement efforts.
    (7) From subsections (e)(4) (G) and (H) because they are 
inapplicable since an exemption is being claimed for subsections (d) and 
(f) for investigatory records contained in this system.
    (8) From subsection (e)(8) because to serve notice would give 
persons sufficient warning to evade law enforcement efforts.
    (9) From subsection (f) because investigatory records contained in 
this system are exempt from the provisions of subsection (d).
    (10) From subsection (g) because it is inapplicable since an 
exemption is being claimed for subsections (d) and (f).
    (m) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c) 
(3) and (4), (d), (e) (2) and (3), (e)(4) (G) and (H), (e)(8), (f) and 
(g):
    (1) U.S. Marshals Service Administrative Proceedings, Claims and 
Civil Litigation Files (JUSTICE/USM-013).


These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in this 
system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) or 
(k)(5).
    (n) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because to release the disclosure 
accounting for disclosures pursuant to the routine uses published for 
this system would permit the subject of a criminal or civil case or 
matter under investigation, or a case or matter in litigation, or under 
regulatory or administrative review or action, to obtain valuable 
information concerning the nature of that investigation, case or matter, 
and present a serious impediment to law enforcement or civil legal 
activities, or reveal a confidential source.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) because the exemption claimed for 
subsection (d) will make this section inapplicable.
    (3) From subsection (d) because to permit access to records 
contained in this system would provide information concerning litigation 
strategy, or case development, and/or reveal the nature of the criminal 
or civil case or matter under investigation or administrative review, or 
in litigation, and present a serious impediment to law enforcement or 
civil legal activities, or reveal a confidential source.
    (4) From subsection (e)(2) because effective legal representation, 
defense, or claim adjudication necessitates collecting information from 
all individuals having knowledge of the criminal or civil case or 
matter. To collect information primarily from the subject individual 
would present a serious impediment to law enforcement or civil legal 
activities.
    (5) From subsection (e)(3) because to inform the individuals as 
required by this subsection would permit the subject of a criminal or 
civil matter under investigation or administrative review to compromise 
that investigation or administrative review and thereby impede law 
enforcement efforts or civil legal activities.

[[Page 365]]

    (6) From subsections (e)(4) (G) and (H) because these provisions are 
inapplicable since this system is exempt from subsections (d) and (f) of 
the Act.
    (7) From subsection (e)(8) because to serve notice would give 
persons sufficient warning to compromise a criminal or civil 
investigation or administrative review and thereby impede law 
enforcement of civil legal activities.
    (8) From subsection (f) because this system of records is exempt 
from the provisions of subsection (d).
    (9) From subsection (g) because it is inapplicable since an 
exemption is claimed for subsections (d) and (f).
    (o) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c) 
(3) and (4), (d), (e) (1), (2), (5) and (g):
    (1) U.S. Marshals Service Prisoner Transportation System (JUSTICE/
USM-003).

    These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in this 
system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).
    (p) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) where the release of the disclosure 
accounting for disclosures made pursuant to subsection (b) of the Act 
would reveal a source who furnished information to the Government in 
confidence.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) to the extent that the system is exempt 
from subsection (d).
    (3) From subsection (d) because access to records would reveal the 
names and other information pertaining to prisoners, including sensitive 
security information such as the identities and locations of 
confidential sources, e.g., informants and protected witnesses; and 
disclose access codes, data entry codes and message routing symbols used 
in law enforcement communications systems to schedule and effect 
prisoner movements. Thus, such a compromise of law enforcement 
communications systems would subject law enforcement personnel and other 
prisoners to harassment and possible danger, and present a serious 
threat to law enforcement activities. To permit amendment of the records 
would interfere with ongoing criminal law enforcement and impose an 
impossible administrative burden by requiring that information affecting 
the prisoner's security classification be continuously reinvestigated 
when contested by the prisoner, or by anyone on his behalf.
    (4) From subsections (e) (1) and (5) because the security 
classification of prisoners is based upon information collected during 
official criminal investigations; and, in the interest of ensuring safe 
and secure prisoner movements it may be necessary to retain information 
the relevance, necessity, accuracy, timeliness, and completeness of 
which cannot be readily established, but which may subsequently prove 
useful in establishing patterns of criminal activity or avoidance, and 
thus be essential to assigning an appropriate security classification to 
the prisoner. The restrictions of subsection (e) (1) and (5) would 
impede the information collection responsibilities of the USMS, and the 
lack of all available information could result in death or serious 
injury to USMS and other law enforcement personnel, prisoners in 
custody, and members of the public.
    (5) From subsection (e)(2) because the requirement to collect 
information from the subject individual would impede the information 
collection responsibilities of the USMS in that the USMS is often 
dependent upon sources other than the subject individual for 
verification of information pertaining to security risks posed by the 
individual prisoner.
    (6) From subsection (g) to the extent that the system is exempt from 
subsection (d).
    (q) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 
552a(c)(3) and (4), (d), (e)(1), (2), (3), (e)(5) and (e)(8) and (g):
    (1) U.S. Marshals Service Prisoner Processing and Population 
Management System (JUSTICE/USM-005).


These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in this 
system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).
    (r) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because to release the disclosure 
accounting would permit the subject of a criminal proceeding to 
determine the extent or nature of law enforcement authorities'

[[Page 366]]

knowledge regarding his/her alleged misconduct or criminal activities. 
The disclosure of such information could alert the subject to devise 
ways in which to conceal his/her activities and/or prevent law 
enforcement from learning additional information about his/her 
activities, or otherwise inhibit law enforcement efforts. In addition, 
where the individual is the subject of an ongoing or potential inquiry/
investigation, such release could reveal the nature thereof prematurely, 
and may also enable the subject to determine the identity of witnesses 
and informants. Such disclosure could compromise the ongoing or 
potential inquiry/investigation, endanger the lives of witnesses and 
informants, or otherwise impede or thwart law enforcement efforts.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) to the extent that the system is exempt 
from subsection (d).
    (3) From subsection (d) because to permit unlimited access would 
permit the subject of a criminal proceeding to determine the extent or 
nature of law enforcement authorities' knowledge regarding his/her 
alleged misconduct or criminal activities. The disclosure of such 
information could alert the subject to devise ways in which to conceal 
his/her activities and/or prevent law enforcement from learning 
additional information about his/her activities, or otherwise inhibit 
law enforcement efforts. Disclosure would also allow the subject to 
obtain sensitive information concerning the existence and nature of 
security measures and jeopardize the safe and secure transfer of the 
prisoner, the safety and security of other prisoners, informants and 
witnesses, law enforcement personnel, and the public. In addition, 
disclosure may enable the subject to learn prematurely of an ongoing or 
potential inquiry/investigation, and may also permit him/her to 
determine the identities of confidential sources, informants, or 
protected witnesses. Such disclosure could compromise the ongoing or 
potential inquiry/investigation, endanger the lives of witnesses and 
informants, or otherwise impede or thwart law enforcement efforts. 
Disclosure may also constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal 
privacy of third parties. Further, disclosure would reveal access codes, 
data entry codes and message routing symbols used in law enforcement 
communications systems. Access to such codes and symbols would permit 
the subject to impede the flow of law enforcement communications and 
compromise the integrity of law enforcement information, and thus 
present a serious threat to law enforcement activities. To permit 
amendment of the records would expose security matters, and would impose 
an impossible administrative burden by requiring that security 
precautions, and information pertaining thereto, be continuously 
reevaluated if contested by the prisoner, or by anyone on his or her 
behalf. Similarly, to permit amendment could interfere with ongoing or 
potential inquiries/investigations by requiring that such inquiries/
investigations be continuously reinvestigated, or that information 
collected (the relevance and accuracy of which cannot readily be 
determined) be subjected to continuous change.
    (4) From subsections (e)(1) and (5) because the system may contain 
investigatory information or information which is derived from 
information collected during official criminal investigations. In the 
interest of effective law enforcement and litigation, of securing the 
prisoner and of protecting the public, it may be necessary to retain 
information the relevance, necessity, accuracy, timeliness and 
completeness of which cannot be readily established. Such information 
may nevertheless provide investigative leads to other Federal or law 
enforcement agencies, or prove necessary to establish patterns of 
criminal activity or behavior, and/or prove essential to the safe and 
secure detention (and movement) of prisoners. Further, the provisions of 
(e)(1) and (e)(5) would restrict the ability of the USMS in exercising 
its judgment in reporting information during investigations or during 
the development of appropriate security measures, and thus present a 
serious impediment to law enforcement efforts.
    (5) From subsection (e)(2) because the requirement to collect 
information from the subject individual would impede the information 
collection responsibilities of the USMS which is often dependent upon 
sources other than the

[[Page 367]]

subject individual for verification of information pertaining to 
security risks posed by the individual prisoner, to alleged misconduct 
or criminal activity of the prisoner, or to any matter affecting the 
safekeeping and disposition of the individual prisoner.
    (6) From subsection (e)(3) because to inform individuals as required 
by this subsection could impede the information gathering process, 
reveal the existence of an ongoing or potential inquiry/investigation or 
security procedure, and compromise law enforcement efforts.
    (7) From subsection (e)(8) because to serve notice would give 
persons sufficient warning to compromise an ongoing or potential 
inquiry/investigation and thereby evade and impede law enforcement and 
security efforts.
    (8) From subsection (g) to the extent that the system is exempt from 
subsection (d).
    (s) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c) 
(3) and (4), (d), (e) (1), (2), (3), (e) (5) and (e) (8) and (g):

            Joint Automated Booking Stations, Justice/USM-014

    (t) These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in 
the system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2). 
Where compliance would not interfere with or adversely affect the law 
enforcement process, the USMS may waive the exemptions, either partially 
or totally. Exemption from the particular subsections are justified for 
the following reasons:
    (1) From subsections (c)(3) and (d) to the extent that access to 
records in this system of records may impede or interfere with law 
enforcement efforts, result in the disclosure of information that would 
constitute and unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of 
collateral record subjects or other third parties, and/or jeopardize the 
health and/or safety of third parties.
    (2) Where access to certain records may be appropriate, exemption 
from the amendment provisions of subsection (d)(2) in necessary to the 
extent that the necessary and appropriate justification, together with 
proof of record inaccuracy, is not provided, and/or to the extent that 
numerous, frivolous requests to amend could impose an impossible 
administrative burden by requiring agencies to continuously review 
booking and arrest data, much of which is collected from the arrestee 
during the arrest.
    (3) From subsection (e)(1) to the extent that it is necessary to 
retain all information in order not to impede, compromise, or interfere 
with law enforcement efforts, e.g., where the significance of the 
information may not be readily determined and/or where such information 
may provide leads or assistance to Federal and other law enforcement 
agencies in discharging their law enforcement responsibilities.
    (4) From subsection (e)(2) because, in some instances, the 
application of this provision would present a serious impediment to law 
enforcement since it may be necessary to obtain and verify information 
from a variety of sources other than the record subject to ensure 
safekeeping, security, and effective law enforcement. For example, it 
may be necessary that medical and psychiatric personnel provide 
information regarding the subject's behavior, physical health, or mental 
stability, etc. To ensure proper care while in custody, or it may be 
necessary to obtain information from a case agent or the court to ensure 
proper disposition of the subject individual.
    (5) From subsection (e)(3) because the requirement that agencies 
inform each individual whom it asks to supply information of such 
information as is required by subsection (e)(3) may, in some cases, 
impede the information gathering process or otherwise interfere with or 
compromise law enforcement efforts, e.g., the subject may deliberately 
withhold information, or give erroneous information.
    (6) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection of information 
for law enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance 
what information is accurate, relevant, timely and complete. With the 
passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may 
acquire new significance and the accuracy of such information can only 
be determined in a court of law. The restrictions imposed by subsection 
(e)(5) would restrict the ability

[[Page 368]]

to collect information for law enforcement purposes and may prevent the 
eventual development of the necessary criminal intelligence or otherwise 
impede effective law enforcement.
    (7) From subsection (e)(8) to the extent that such notice may 
impede, interfere with, or otherwise compromise law enforcement and 
security efforts.
    (8) From subsection (g) to the extent that this system is exempt 
from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d).
    (u) Consistent with the legislative purpose of the Privacy Act of 
1974, the United States Marshals Service will grant access to nonexempt 
material in records which are maintained by the Service. Disclosure will 
be governed by the Department's Privacy Regulations, but will be limited 
to the extent that the identity of confidential sources will not be 
compromised; subjects of an investigation of an actual or potential 
criminal, civil or regulatory violation will not be alerted to the 
investigation; the physical safety of witnesses, informants and law 
enforcement personnel will not be endangered; the privacy of third 
parties will not be violated; and that the disclosure would not 
otherwise impede effective law enforcement. Whenever possible, 
information of the above nature will be deleted from the requested 
documents and the balance made available. The controlling principle 
behind this limited access is to allow disclosures except those 
indicated above. The decisions to release information from these systems 
will be made on a case-by-case basis.

Sec. 16.102  Exemption of Drug Enforcement Administration and Immigration and 

Naturalization Service Joint System of Records.

    (a) The following system of records is exempted pursuant to 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) from subsections (c) (3) and (4), (d), 
(e) (1), (2) and (3), (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I), (e)(5) and (8), (f), 
(g), and (h) of 5 U.S.C. 552a; in addition the following system of 
records is exempted pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552 (k)(1) 
and (k)(2) from subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G), (H), and 
(I), and (f) of 5 U.S.C. 552a.
    (1) Automated Intelligence Record System (Pathfinder), JUSTICE/DEA-
INS-111.


These exemptions apply to the extent that information in those systems 
is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j)(2), (k)(1) and 
(k)(2).
    (b) The system of records listed under paragraph (a) of this section 
is exempted, for the reasons set forth from the following provisions of 
5 U.S.C. 552a:
    (1)(c)(3). The release of the disclosure accounting for disclosures 
made pursuant to subsection (b) of the Act, including those permitted 
under the routine uses published for these systems of records, would 
permit the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential 
criminal, civil, or regulatory violation to determine whether he is the 
subject of investigation, or to obtain valuable information concerning 
the nature of that investigation, and the information obtained, or the 
identity of witnesses and informants and would therefore present a 
serious impediment to law enforcement. In addition, disclosure of the 
accounting would amount to notice to the individual of the existence of 
a record; such notice requirement under subsection (f)(1) is 
specifically exempted for these systems of records.
    (2)(c)(4). Since an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d) of 
the Act (Access to Records) this subsection is inapplicable to the 
extent that these systems of records are exempted from subsection (d).
    (3)(d). Access to the records contained in these systems would 
inform the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential 
criminal, civil, or regulatory violation of the existence of that 
investigation, or the nature and scope of the information and evidence 
obtained as to his activities, of the identity of witnesses and 
informants, or would provide information that could enable the subject 
to avoid detection or apprehension. These factors would present a 
serious impediment to effective law enforcement because they

[[Page 369]]

could prevent the successful completion of the investigation, endanger 
the physical safety of witnesses or informants, and lead to the improper 
influencing of witnesses, the destruction of evidence, or the 
fabrication of testimony.
    (4)(e)(1). The notices of these systems of records published in the 
Federal Register set forth the basic statutory or related authority for 
maintenance of this system. However, in the course of criminal or other 
law enforcement investigations, cases, and matters, the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service or the Drug Enforcement Administration will 
occasionally obtain information concerning actual or potential 
violations of law that are not strictly within its statutory or other 
authority or may compile information in the course of an investigation 
which may not be relevant to a specific prosecution. In the interests of 
effective law enforcement, it is necessary to retain such information in 
these systems of records since it can aid in establishing patterns of 
criminal activity and can provide valuable leads for federal and other 
law enforcement agencies.
    (5)(e)(2). In a criminal investigation or prosecution, the 
requirement that information be collected to the greatest extent 
practicable from the subject individual would present a serious 
impediment to law enforcement because the subject of the investigation 
or prosecution would be placed on notice as to the existence of the 
investigation and would therefore be able to avoid detection or 
apprehension, to influence witnesses improperly, to destroy evidence, or 
to fabricate testimony.
    (6)(e)(3). The requirement that individuals supplying information be 
provided with a form stating the requirements of subsection (e)(3) would 
constitute a serious impediment to law enforcement in that it could 
compromise the existence of a confidential investigation or reveal the 
identity of witnesses or confidential informants.
    (7)(e)(4) (G) and (H). Since an exemption is being claimed for 
subsections (f) (Agency Rules) and (d) (Access to Records) of the Act 
these subsections are inapplicable to the extent that these systems of 
records are exempted from subsections (f) and (d).
    (8)(e)(4)(I). The categories of sources of the records in these 
systems have been published in the Federal Register in broad generic 
terms in the belief that this is all that subsection (e)(4)(I) of the 
Act requires. In the event, however, that this subsection should be 
interpreted to require more detail as to the identity of sources of the 
records in these systems, exemption from this provision is necessary in 
order to protect the confidentiality of the sources of criminal and 
other law enforcement information. Such exemption is further necessary 
to protect the privacy and physical safety of witnesses and informants.
    (9)(e)(5). In the collection of information for criminal law 
enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance what 
information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. With the 
passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may 
acquire new significance as further investigation brings new details to 
light and the accuracy of such information can often only be determined 
in a court of law. The restrictions of subsection (e)(5) would restrict 
the ability of trained investigators, intelligence analysts, and 
government attorneys in exercising their judgment in reporting on 
information and investigations and impede the development of criminal or 
other intelligence necessary for effective law enforcement.
    (10)(e)(8). The individual notice requirements of subsection (e)(8) 
could present a serious impediment to law enforcement as this could 
interfere with the ability to issue warrants or subpoenas and could 
reveal investigative techniques, procedures, or evidence.
    (11)(f). Procedures for notice to an individual pursuant to 
subsection (f)(1) as to the existence of records pertaining to him 
dealing with an actual or potential criminal, civil, or regulatory 
investigation or prosecution must be exempted because such notice to an 
individual would be detrimental to the successful conduct and/or 
completion of an investigation or prosecution pending or future. In 
addition, mere notice of the fact of an investigation could inform

[[Page 370]]

the subject or others that their activities are under or may become the 
subject of an investigation and could enable the subjects to avoid 
detection or apprehension, to influence witnesses improperly, to destroy 
evidence, or to fabricate testimony.


Since an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d) of the Act 
(Access to Records) the rules required pursuant to subsections (f) (2) 
through (5) are inapplicable to these systems of records to the extent 
that these systems of records are exempted from subsection (d).
    (12)(g). Since an exemption is being claimed for subsections (d) 
(Access to Records) and (f) (Agency Rules) this section is inapplicable, 
and is exempted for the reasons set forth for those subsections, to the 
extent that these systems of records are exempted from subsections (d) 
and (f).
    (13)(h). Since an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d) 
(Access to Records) and (f) (Agency Rules) this section is inapplicable, 
and is exempted for the reasons set forth for those subsections, to the 
extent that these systems of records are exempted from subsections (d) 
and (f).
    (14) In addition, exemption is claimed for these systems of records 
from compliance with the following provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 
(5 U.S.C. 552a) pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1): 
subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I), and (f) to 
the extent that the records contained in these systems are specifically 
authorized to be kept secret in the interests of national defense and 
foreign policy.

Sec. 16.103  Exemption of the INTERPOL-United States National Central Bureau 

(INTERPOL-USNCB) System.

    (a) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c) 
(3) and (4), (d), (e) (1), (2), and (3), (e)(4) (G) and (H), (e)(5) and 
(8), (f) and (g):
    (1) The INTERPOL-United States National Central Bureau (INTERPOL-
USNCB) (Department of Justice) INTERPOL-USNCB Records System (JUSTICE/
INTERPOL-001).


This exemption applies only to the extent that information in this 
system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j)(2), (k)(2), 
and (k)(5).
    (b) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of accounting 
disclosures would place the subject of an investigation on notice that 
he is under investigation and provide him with significant information 
concerning the nature of the investigation, thus resulting in a serious 
impediment to law enforcement.
    (2) From subsections (c)(4), (d), (e)(4) (G), and (H), (f) and (g) 
because these provisions concern individual access to records and such 
access might compromise ongoing investigations reveal investigatory 
techniques and confidential informants, and invade the privacy of 
private citizens who provide information in connection with a particular 
investigation.
    (3) From subsection (e)(1) because information received in the 
course of an international criminal investigation may involve a 
violation of state or local law, and it is beneficial to maintain this 
information to provide investigative leads to state and local law 
enforcement agencies.
    (4) From subsection (e)(2) because collecting information from the 
subject of criminal investigations would thwart the investigation by 
placing the subject on notice.
    (5) From subsection (e)(3) because supplying an individual with a 
statement of the intended use of the requested information could 
compromise the existence of a confidential investigation, and may 
inhibit cooperation.
    (6) From subsection (e)(5) because the vast majority of these 
records come from local criminal justice agencies and it is 
administratively impossible to ensure that the records comply with this 
provision. Submitting agencies are, however, urged on a continuing basis 
to ensure that their records are accurate and include all dispositions.
    (7) From subsection (e)(8) because the notice requirements of this 
provision could present a serious impediment to law enforcement by 
revealing investigative techniques, procedures, and

[[Page 371]]

the existence of confidential investigations.

[Order No. 8-82, 47 FR 44255, Oct. 7, 1982, as amended by Order No. 6-

<R05>
Sec. 16.104  Exemption of Office of Special Counsel--Waco System.

    (a) The following system of records is exempted from subsections 
(c)(3) and (4); (d)(1), (2), (3), and (4); (e)(1), (2), (3), (5) and 
(8); and (g) of the Privacy Act pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) and (k): 
CaseLink Document Database for Office of Special Counsel--Waco, JUSTICE/
OSCW-001. These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in 
a record is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) and (k).
    (b) Only that portion of this system which consists of criminal or 
civil investigatory information is exempted for the reasons set forth 
from the following subsections:
    (1) Subsection (c)(3). To provide the subject of a criminal or civil 
matter or case under investigation with an accounting of disclosures of 
records concerning him or her would inform that individual of the 
existence, nature, or scope of that investigation and thereby seriously 
impede law enforcement efforts by permitting the record subject and 
other persons to whom he might disclose the records to avoid criminal 
penalties and civil remedies.
    (2) Subsection (c)(4). This subsection is inapplicable to the extent 
that an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d).
    (3) Subsection (d)(1). Disclosure of investigatory information could 
interfere with the investigation, reveal the identity of confidential 
sources, and result in an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of others.
    (4) Subsection (d)(2). Amendment of the records would interfere with 
ongoing criminal law enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible 
administrative burden by requiring criminal investigations to be 
continuously reinvestigated.
    (5) Subsections (d)(3) and (4). These subsections are inapplicable 
to the extent exemption is claimed from (d)(1) and (2).
    (6) Subsections (e)(1) and (5). It is often impossible to determine 
in advance if investigatory records contained in this system are 
accurate, relevant, timely and complete; but, in the interests of 
effective law enforcement, it is necessary to retain this information to 
aid in establishing patterns of activity and provide leads in criminal 
investigations.
    (7) Subsection (e)(2). To collect information from the subject 
individual would serve notice that he or she is the subject of criminal 
investigative or law enforcement activity and thereby present a serious 
impediment to law enforcement.
    (8) Subsection (e)(3). To inform individuals as required by this 
subsection would reveal the existence of an investigation and compromise 
law enforcement efforts.
    (9) Subsection (e)(8). To serve notice would give persons sufficient 
warning to evade law enforcement efforts.
    (10) Subsection (g). This subsection is inapplicable to the extent 
that the system is exempt from other specific subsections of the Privacy 
Act.

Sec. 16.105  Exemption of Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force System.

    (a) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a, 
subsections (c)(3), (d)(1), (2), (3) and (4), and (e)(1) and (4)(I): 
Flight Training Candidates File System (JUSTICE/FTTTF-001). This 
exemption applies only to the extent that information is subject to 
exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1).
    (b) Exemption from the particular subsections is justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because making available to a record 
subject the accounting of disclosures could reveal information that is 
classified in the interest of national security.
    (2) From subsection (d)(1), (2), (3) and (4) because access to and 
amendment of certain portions of records within the system would tend to 
reveal or compromise information classified in the interest of national 
security.
    (3) From subsection (e)(1) because it is often impossible to 
determine in advance if information obtained will be relevant for the 
purposes of conducting the risk analysis for flight training candidates.

[[Page 372]]

    (4) From subsection (e)(4)(I) to the extent that this subsection is 
interpreted to require more detail regarding the record sources in this 
system than have been published in the Federal Register. Should the 
subsection be so interpreted, exemption from this provision is necessary 
because greater specificity concerning the sources of these records 
could compromise national security.

Sec. 16.106  Exemption of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and 

Explosives (ATF)--Limited Access.

    (a) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 
552a(c)(3) and (4), (d)(1), (2), (3) and (4), (e)(1), (2), and (3), 
(e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), (e)(5) and (8), (f) and (g).
    (1) Criminal Investigation Report System (JUSTICE/ATF-003).
    (2) These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in 
this system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2). 
Where compliance would not appear to interfere with or adversely affect 
the overall law enforcement process, ATF may waive the applicable 
exemption.
    (b) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because making available to a record 
subject the accounting of disclosures from records concerning him/her 
would reveal investigative interest not only of ATF, but also of the 
recipient agency. This would permit the record subject to take measures 
to impede the investigation, e.g., destroy evidence, intimidate 
potential witnesses or flee the area to avoid the thrust of the 
investigation.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) because an exemption being claimed for 
subsection (d) makes this subsection inapplicable.
    (3) From subsections (d)(1), (e)(4)(G) and (H), (f) and (g) because 
these provisions concern individual access to investigative records, 
compliance with which could compromise sensitive information, interfere 
with the overall law enforcement process by revealing a pending 
sensitive investigation, possibly identify a confidential source or 
disclose information, including actual or potential tax information, 
which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of another individual's 
personal privacy, reveal a sensitive investigative technique, or 
constitute a potential danger to the health or safety of law enforcement 
personnel.
    (4) From subsection (d)(2) because, due to the nature of the 
information collected and the essential length of time it is maintained, 
to require ATF to amend information thought to be incorrect, irrelevant 
or untimely, would create an impossible administrative and investigative 
burden by forcing the agency to continuously retrograde its 
investigations attempting to resolve questions of accuracy, etc.
    (5) From subsections (d)(3) and (4) because these subsections are 
inapplicable to the extent exemption is claimed from (d)(1) and (2).
    (6) From subsection (e)(1) because: (i) It is not possible in all 
instances to determine relevancy or necessity of specific information in 
the early stages of a criminal or other investigation.
    (ii) Relevance and necessity are questions of judgment and timing; 
what appears relevant and necessary when collected ultimately may be 
deemed unnecessary. It is only after the information is assessed that 
its relevancy and necessity in a specific investigative activity can be 
established.
    (iii) In any investigation, ATF might obtain information concerning 
violations of law not under its jurisdiction, but in the interest of 
effective law enforcement, dissemination will be made to the agency 
charged with enforcing such law.
    (iv) In interviewing individuals or obtaining other forms of 
evidence during an investigation, information could be obtained, the 
nature of which would leave in doubt its relevancy and necessity. Such 
information, however, could be relevant to another investigation or to 
an investigative activity under the jurisdiction of another agency.
    (7) From subsection (e)(2) because the nature of criminal and other 
investigative activities is such that vital information about an 
individual can only be obtained from other persons who are familiar with 
such individual and his/her activities. In such investigations it is not 
feasible to rely upon information

[[Page 373]]

furnished by the individual concerning his own activities.
    (8) From subsection (e)(3) because disclosure would provide the 
subject with substantial information that could impede or compromise the 
investigation. The individual could seriously interfere with undercover 
investigative activities and could take steps to evade the investigation 
or flee a specific area.
    (9) From subsection (e)(4)(I) because the categories of sources of 
the records in these systems have been published in the Federal Register 
in broad generic terms in the belief that this is all that subsection 
(e)(4)(I) of the Act requires. In the event, however, that this 
subsection should be interpreted to require more detail as to the 
identity of sources of the records in these systems, exemption from this 
provision is necessary in order to protect the confidentiality of the 
sources of criminal and other law enforcement information. Such 
exemption is further necessary to protect the privacy and physical 
safety of witnesses and informants.
    (10) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection of information 
for law enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance 
what information is accurate, relevant, timely and complete. With the 
passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may 
acquire new significance as further investigation brings new details to 
light. The restrictions imposed by subsection (e)(5) would restrict the 
ability of trained investigators and intelligence analysts to exercise 
their judgment in reporting on investigations and impede the development 
of criminal intelligence necessary for effective law enforcement.
    (11) From subsection (e)(8) because the notice requirements of this 
provision could seriously interfere with a law enforcement activity by 
alerting the subject of a criminal or other investigation of existing 
investigative interest.
    (c) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 
552a(c)(3), (d)(1), (2), (3) and (4), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), 
and (f).
    (1) Internal Security Record System (JUSTICE/ATF-006).
    (2) These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in 
this system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and 
(k)(5). Where compliance would not appear to interfere with or adversely 
affect the overall law enforcement process, ATF may waive the applicable 
exemption.
    (d) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because to provide the subject with an 
accounting of disclosures of records in this system could inform that 
individual of the existence, nature, or scope of an actual or potential 
law enforcement investigation, and thereby seriously impede law 
enforcement efforts by permitting the record subject and other persons 
to whom he might disclose the records to avoid criminal penalties, civil 
remedies, or other measures.
    (2) From subsection (d)(1) because disclosure of records in the 
system could reveal the identity of confidential sources and result in 
an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of others. Disclosure may also 
reveal information relating to actual or potential criminal 
investigations. Such breaches would restrict the free flow of 
information which is vital to the law enforcement process and the 
determination of an applicant's qualifications.
    (3) From subsection (d)(2) because, due to the nature of the 
information collected and the essential length of time it is maintained, 
to require ATF to amend information thought to be incorrect, irrelevant 
or untimely, would create an impossible administrative and investigative 
burden by forcing the agency to continuously retrograde its 
investigations attempting to resolve questions of accuracy, etc.
    (4) From subsections (d)(3) and (4) because these subsections are 
inapplicable to the extent exemption is claimed from (d)(1) and (2).

[[Page 374]]

    (5) From subsection (e)(1) because it is often impossible to 
determine in advance if investigative records contained in this system 
are accurate, relevant, timely, complete, or of some assistance to 
either effective law enforcement investigations, or to the determination 
of the qualifications and suitability of an applicant. It also is 
necessary to retain this information to aid in establishing patterns of 
activity and provide investigative leads. Information that may appear 
irrelevant, when combined with other apparently irrelevant information, 
can on occasion provide a composite picture of a subject or an applicant 
which assists the law enforcement process and the determination of an 
applicant's suitability qualifications.
    (6) From subsection (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) because these 
provisions concern individual access to investigative records, 
compliance with which could compromise sensitive information, interfere 
with the overall law enforcement or qualification process by revealing a 
pending sensitive investigation, possibly identify a confidential source 
or disclose information which would constitute an unwarranted invasion 
of another individual's personal privacy, reveal a sensitive 
investigative technique, or constitute a potential danger to the health 
or safety of law enforcement personnel. In addition, disclosure of 
information collected pursuant to an employment suitability or similar 
inquiry could reveal the identity of a source who provided information 
under an express promise of confidentiality, or could compromise the 
objectivity or fairness of a testing or examination process.
    (7) From subsection (e)(4)(I) because the categories of sources of 
the records in these systems have been published in the Federal Register 
in broad generic terms in the belief that this is all that subsection 
(e)(4)(I) of the Act requires. In the event, however, that this 
subsection should be interpreted to require more detail as to the 
identity of sources of the records in these systems, exemption from this 
provision is necessary in order to protect the confidentiality of the 
sources of criminal and other law enforcement information. Such 
exemption is further necessary to protect the privacy and physical 
safety of witnesses and informants.
    (e) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 
552a(c)(3), (d)(1), (2), (3) and (4), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), 
and (f).
    (1) Personnel Record System (JUSTICE/ATF-007).
    (2) These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in 
this system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5). 
Where compliance would not appear to interfere with or adversely affect 
the overall law enforcement process, ATF may waive the applicable 
exemption.
    (f) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because making available to a record 
subject the accounting of disclosures from records concerning him/her 
would reveal the existence, nature, or scope of an actual or potential 
personnel action. This would permit the record subject to take measures 
to hamper or impede such actions.
    (2) From subsections (d)(1), (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) because many 
persons are contacted who, without an assurance of anonymity, refuse to 
provide information concerning a candidate for a position with ATF. 
Access could reveal the identity of the source of the information and 
constitute a breach of the promise of confidentiality on the part of 
ATF. Such breaches ultimately would restrict the free flow of 
information vital to a determination of a candidate's qualifications and 
suitability.
    (3) From subsection (d)(2) because, due to the nature of the 
information collected and the essential length of time it is maintained, 
to require ATF to amend information thought to be incorrect, irrelevant 
or untimely, would create an impossible administrative and investigative 
burden by forcing the agency to continuously retrograde its 
investigations attempting to resolve questions of accuracy, etc.
    (4) From subsections (d)(3) and (4) because these subsections are 
inapplicable to the extent exemption is claimed from (d)(1) and (2).
    (5) From subsection (e)(1) because:
    (i) It is not possible in all instances to determine relevancy or 
necessity of

[[Page 375]]

specific information in the early stages of a personnel-related action.
    (ii) Relevance and necessity are questions of judgment and timing; 
what appears relevant and necessary when collected ultimately may be 
deemed unnecessary. It is only after the information is assessed that 
its relevancy and necessity in a specific investigative activity can be 
established.
    (iii) ATF might obtain information concerning violations of law not 
under its jurisdiction, but in the interest of effective law 
enforcement, dissemination will be made to the agency charged with 
enforcing such law.
    (iv) In interviewing individuals or obtaining other forms of 
evidence during an investigation, information could be obtained, the 
nature of which would leave in doubt its relevancy and necessity. Such 
information, however, could be relevant to another investigation or to 
an investigative activity under the jurisdiction of another agency.
    (6) From subsection (e)(4)(I) because the categories of sources of 
the records in these systems have been published in the Federal Register 
in broad generic terms in the belief that this is all that subsection 
(e)(4)(I) of the Act requires. In the event, however, that this 
subsection should be interpreted to require more detail as to the 
identity of sources of the records in these systems, exemption from this 
provision is necessary in order to protect the confidentiality of the 
sources of criminal and other law enforcement information. Such 
exemption is further necessary to protect the privacy and physical 
safety of witnesses and informants.
    (g) The following systems of records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 
552a(c)(3), (d)(1), (2), (3) and (4), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), 
and (f).
    (1) Regulatory Enforcement Record System (JUSTICE/ATF-008).
    (2) Technical and Scientific Services Record System (JUSTICE/ATF-
009).
    (3) These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in 
this system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). 
Where compliance would not appear to interfere with or adversely affect 
the overall law enforcement process, ATF may waive the applicable 
exemption.
    (h) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because making available to a record 
subject the accounting of disclosures from records concerning him/her 
would reveal investigative interest, whether civil, criminal or 
regulatory, not only of ATF, but also of the recipient agency. This 
would permit the record subject to take measures to impede the 
investigation, e.g., destroy evidence, intimidate potential witnesses or 
flee the area to avoid the thrust of the investigation thus seriously 
hampering the regulatory and law enforcement functions of ATF.
    (2) From subsections (d)(1), (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) because 
these provisions concern individual access to investigative and 
compliance records, disclosure of which could compromise sensitive 
information, interfere with the overall law enforcement and regulatory 
process by revealing a pending sensitive investigation, possibly 
identify a confidential source or disclose information, including actual 
or potential tax information, which would constitute an unwarranted 
invasion of another individual's personal privacy, reveal a sensitive 
investigative technique, or constitute a potential danger to the health 
or safety of law enforcement personnel.
    (3) From subsection (d)(2) because, due to the nature of the 
information collected and the essential length of time it is maintained, 
to require ATF to amend information thought to be incorrect, irrelevant 
or untimely, would create an impossible administrative and investigative 
burden by forcing the agency to continuously retrograde its 
investigations and compliance actions attempting to resolve questions of 
accuracy, etc.
    (4) From subsections (d)(3) and (4) because these subsections are 
inapplicable to the extent exemption is claimed from (d)(1) and (2).
    (5) From subsection (e)(1) because:
    (i) It is not possible in all instances to determine relevancy or 
necessity of specific information in the early stages of a criminal, 
civil, regulatory, or other investigation.

[[Page 376]]

    (ii) Relevance and necessity are questions of judgment and timing; 
what appears relevant and necessary when collected ultimately may be 
deemed unnecessary. It is only after the information is assessed that 
its relevancy and necessity in a specific investigative or regulatory 
activity can be established.
    (iii) In any investigation or compliance action ATF might obtain 
information concerning violations of law not under its jurisdiction, but 
in the interest of effective law enforcement, dissemination will be made 
to the agency charged with enforcing such law.
    (iv) In interviewing individuals or obtaining other forms of 
evidence during an investigation, information could be obtained, the 
nature of which would leave in doubt its relevancy and necessity. Such 
information, however, could be relevant to another investigation or 
compliance action or to an investigative activity under the jurisdiction 
of another agency.
    (6) From subsection (e)(4)(I) because the categories of sources of 
the records in these systems have been published in the Federal Register 
in broad generic terms in the belief that this is all that subsection 
(e)(4)(I) of the Act requires. In the event, however, that this 
subsection should be interpreted to require more detail as to the 
identity of sources of the records in these systems, exemption from this 
provision is necessary in order to protect the confidentiality of the 
sources of criminal, regulatory, and other law enforcement information. 
Such exemption is further necessary to protect the privacy and physical 
safety of witnesses and informants.

Sec. 16.130  Exemption of Department of Justice Systems: Correspondence 

Management Systems for the Department of Justice (DOJ-003); Freedom of 

Information Act, Privacy Act and Mandatory Declassification Review Requests 

and Administrative Appeals for the Department of Justice (DOJ-004).

    (a) The following Department of Justice systems of records are 
exempted from subsections (c)(3) and (4); (d)(1), (2), (3) and (4); 
(e)(1), (2), (3), (5) and (8); and (g) of the Privacy Act pursuant to 5 
U.S.C. 552a(j) and (k). These exemptions apply only to the extent that 
information in a record is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552a(j) and (k).
    (1) Correspondence Management Systems (CMS) for the Department of 
Justice (DOJ), DOJ/003.
    (2) Freedom of Information Act, Privacy Act, and Mandatory 
Declassification Review Requests and Administrative Appeals for the 
Department of Justice (DOJ), DOJ/004.
    (b) These systems are exempted for the reasons set forth from the 
following subsections:
    (1) Subsection (c)(3). To provide the subject of a criminal, civil, 
or counterintelligence matter or case under investigation with an 
accounting of disclosures of records concerning him or her could inform 
that individual of the existence, nature, or scope of that 
investigation, and thereby seriously impede law enforcement or 
counterintelligence efforts by permitting the record subject and other 
persons to whom he might disclose the records to avoid criminal 
penalties, civil remedies, or counterintelligence measures.
    (2) Subsection (c)(4). This subsection is inapplicable to the extent 
that an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d).
    (3) Subsection (d)(1). Disclosure of investigatory information could 
interfere with the investigation, reveal the identity of confidential 
sources, and result in an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of others. 
Disclosure of classified national security information would cause 
damage to the national security of the United States.
    (4) Subsection (d)(2). Amendment of the records would interfere with 
ongoing criminal or civil law enforcement proceedings and impose an 
impossible administrative burden by requiring investigations to be 
continuously reinvestigated.
    (5) Subsections (d)(3) and (4). These subsections are inapplicable 
to the extent exemption is claimed from (d)(1) and (2).
    (6) Subsection (e)(1). It is often impossible to determine in 
advance if investigatory records contained in this system are accurate, 
relevant, timely and

[[Page 377]]

complete, but, in the interests of effective law enforcement and 
counterintelligence, it is necessary to retain this information to aid 
in establishing patterns of activity and provide investigative leads.
    (7) Subsection (e)(2). To collect information from the subject 
individual could serve notice that he or she is the subject of a 
criminal investigation and thereby present a serious impediment to such 
investigations.
    (8) Subsection (e)(3). To inform individuals as required by this 
subsection could reveal the existence of a criminal investigation and 
compromise investigative efforts.
    (9) Subsection (e)(5). It is often impossible to determine in 
advance if investigatory records contained in this system are accurate, 
relevant, timely and complete, but, in the interests of effective law 
enforcement, it is necessary to retain this information to aid in 
establishing patterns of activity and provide investigative leads.
    (10) Subsection (e)(8). To serve notice could give persons 
sufficient warning to evade investigative efforts.
    (11) Subsection (g). This subsection is inapplicable to the extent 
that the system is exempt from other specific subsections of the Privacy 
Act.

Sec. 16.131  Exemption of Department of Justice (DOJ)/Nationwide Joint 

Automated Booking System (JABS), DOJ-005.

    (a) The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 
552a(c)(3) and (4), (d), (e)(1), (2), (3), (4)(G) and (H), (e)(5) and 
(8), (f) and (g): Nationwide Joint Automated Booking System, Justice/
DOJ-005. These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in 
the system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and 
(k)(2). Where compliance would not interfere with or adversely affect 
the law enforcement process, the DOJ may waive the exemptions, either 
partially or totally.
    (b) Exemption from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsections (c)(3), (c)(4), and (d) to the extent that 
access to records in this system of records may impede or interfere with 
law enforcement efforts, result in the disclosure of information that 
would constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of 
collateral record subjects or other third parties, and/or jeopardize the 
health and/or safety of third parties.
    (2) From subsection (e)(1) to the extent that it is necessary to 
retain all information in order not to impede, compromise, or interfere 
with law enforcement efforts, e.g., where the significance of the 
information may not be readily determined and/or where such information 
may provide leads or assistance to Federal and other law enforcement 
agencies in discharging their law enforcement responsibilities.
    (3) From subsection (e)(2) because, in some instances, the 
application of this provision would present a serious impediment to law 
enforcement since it may be necessary to obtain and verify information 
from a variety to sources other than the record subject to ensure 
safekeeping, security, and effective law enforcement. For example, it 
maybe necessary that medical and psychiatric personnel provide 
information regarding the subject's behavior, physical. health, or 
mental stability, etc. to ensure proper care while in custody, or it may 
be necessary to obtain information from a case agent or the court to 
ensure proper disposition of the subject individual.
    (4) From subsection (e)(3) because the requirement that agencies 
inform each individual whom it asks to supply information of such 
information as is required by subsection (e)(3) may, in some cases, 
impede the information gathering process or otherwise interfere with or 
compromise law enforcement efforts, e.g., the subject may deliberately 
withhold information, or give erroneous information.
    (5) From subsection (4)(G) and(H) because the application of these 
provisions would present a serious impediment to law enforcement 
efforts.
    (6) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection of information 
for law enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance 
what information is accurate, relevant, timely and complete. With the 
passage of time,

[[Page 378]]

seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may acquire new 
significance and the accuracy of such information can only be determined 
in a court of law. The restrictions imposed by subsection (e)(5) would 
restrict the ability to collect information for law enforcement 
purposes, may prevent the eventual development of the necessary criminal 
intelligence, or otherwise impede law enforcement or delay trained law 
enforcement personnel from timely exercising their judgment in managing 
the arrestee.
    (7) From subsection (e)(8) to the extent that such notice may 
impede, interfere with, or otherwise compromise law enforcement and 
security efforts.
    (8) From subsection 5 U.S.C. 552a(f) to the extent that compliance 
with the requirement for procedures providing individual access to 
records, compliance could impede, compromise, or interfere with law 
enforcement efforts.
    (9) From subsection (g) to the extent that this system is exempt 
from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d).

U.S.C. 552a(j) and (k): Personnel Investigation and Security Clearance 
Records for the Department of Justice (DOJ), DOJ-006. These exemptions 
apply only to the extent that information in a record is subject to 
exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) and (k).
    (b) Exemption from the particular subsections is justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) Subsection (c)(3). To provide the subject with an accounting of 
disclosures of records in this system could inform that individual of 
the existence, nature, or scope of an actual or potential law 
enforcement or counterintelligence investigation, and thereby seriously 
impede law enforcement or counterintelligence efforts by permitting the 
record subject and other persons to whom he might disclose the records 
to avoid criminal penalties, civil remedies, or counterintelligence 
measures.
    (2) Subsection (c)(4). This subsection is inapplicable to the extent 
that an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d).
    (3) Subsection (d)(1). Disclosure of records in the system could 
reveal the identity of confidential sources and result in an unwarranted 
invasion of the privacy of others. Disclosure may also reveal 
information relating to actual or potential criminal investigations. 
Disclosure of classified national security information would cause 
damage to the national security of the United States.
    (4) Subsection (d)(2). Amendment of the records could interfere with 
ongoing criminal or civil law enforcement proceedings and impose an 
impossible administrative burden by requiring investigations to be 
continuously reinvestigated.
    (5) Subsections (d)(3) and (4). These subsections are inapplicable 
to the extent exemption is claimed from (d)(1) and (2).
    (6) Subsection (e)(1). It is often impossible to determine in 
advance if investigatory records contained in this system are accurate, 
relevant, timely and complete, but, in the interests of effective law 
enforcement and counterintelligence, it is necessary to retain this 
information to aid in establishing patterns of activity and provide 
investigative leads.
    (7) Subsection (e)(2). To collect information from the subject 
individual could serve notice that he or she is the subject of a 
criminal investigation and thereby present a serious impediment to such 
investigations.
    (8) Subsection (e)(3). To inform individuals as required by this

advance if investigatory records contained in this system are accurate, 
relevant, timely and complete, but, in the interests of effective law 
enforcement, it is necessary to

retain this information to aid in establishing patterns of activity and 
provide investigative leads.
    (10) Subsection (e)(8). To serve notice could give persons 
sufficient warning to evade investigative efforts.

Sec. 16.133  Exemption of Department of Justice Regional Data Exchange System 

(RDEX), DOJ-012.

    (a) The Department of Justice Regional Data Exchange System (RDEX), 
DOJ-012, is exempted from subsections (c)(3) and (4); (d)(1), (2), (3), 
and (4); (e)(1), (2), (3), (5), and (8); and (g) of the Privacy Act 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2). These exemptions apply only to the 
extent that information in a record is subject to exemption pursuant to 
5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).
    (b) This system is exempted from the following subsections for the 
reasons set forth below:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because making available to a record 
subject the accounting of disclosures of criminal law enforcement 
records concerning him or her could inform that individual of the 
existence, nature, or scope of an investigation, or could otherwise 
seriously impede law enforcement efforts.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) because this system is exempt from 
subsections (d)(1), (2), (3), and (4).
    (3) From subsection (d)(1) because disclosure of criminal law 
enforcement information could interfere with an investigation, reveal 
the identity of confidential sources, and result in an unwarranted 
invasion of the privacy of others.
    (4) From subsection (d)(2) because amendment of the records would 
interfere with ongoing criminal law enforcement proceedings and impose 
an impossible administrative burden by requiring investigations to be 
continuously reinvestigated.
    (5) From subsections (d)(3) and (4) because these subsections are 
inapplicable to the extent that exemption is claimed from subsections 
(d)(1) and (2).
    (6) From subsection (e)(1) because it is often impossible to 
determine in advance if criminal law enforcement records contained in 
this system are relevant and necessary, but, in the interests of 
effective law enforcement, it is necessary to retain this information to 
aid in establishing patterns of activity and provide investigative 
leads.
    (7) From subsection (e)(2) because collecting information from the 
subject individual could serve notice that he or she is the subject of a 
criminal law enforcement matter and thereby present a serious impediment 
to law enforcement efforts. Further, because of the nature of criminal 
law enforcement matters, vital information about an individual 
frequently can be obtained only from other persons who are familiar with 
the individual and his or her activities and it often is not practicable 
to rely on information provided directly by the individual.
    (8) From subsection (e)(3) because informing individuals as required 
by this subsection could reveal the existence of a criminal law 
enforcement matter and compromise criminal law enforcement efforts.
    (9) From subsection (e)(5) because it is often impossible to 
determine in advance if criminal law enforcement records contained in 
this system are accurate, relevant, timely, and complete, but, in the 
interests of effective law enforcement, it is necessary to retain this 
information to aid in establishing patterns of activity and obtaining 
investigative leads.
    (10) From subsection (e)(8) because serving notice could give 
persons sufficient warning to evade criminal law enforcement efforts.
    (11) From subsection (g) to the extent that this system is exempt 
from other specific subsections of the Privacy Act.

Sec. 16.201  Voting by the Commissioners without joint deliberation.

    (a) Whenever the Commission's Chairman so directs, any matter which 
(1) does not appear to require joint deliberation among the members of

    (a) The Commission, by majority vote, may close to public 
observation any meeting or portion thereof, and withhold from the public 
announcement concerning such meeting any information, if public 
observation or the furnishing of such information is likely to:
    (1) Disclose matters:
    (i) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an 
executive order to be kept secret in the interests of national defense 
or foreign policy and
    (ii) In fact properly classified pursuant to such executive order;
    (2) Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of 
the Commission or any agency of the Government of the United States;
    (3) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by 
statute (other than 5 U.S.C. 552, or the Federal Rules of Criminal 
Procedure): Provided, That such statute or rule (i) requires that the 
matters be withheld in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the 
issue, or (ii) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers 
to particular types of matters to be withheld, including exempted 
material under the Privacy Act of 1974 or the Commission's Alternate 
Means of Access under the Privacy Act of 1974, as set forth at 28 CFR

    (4) Disclose a trade secret or commercial or financial information 
obtained from any person, corporation, business, labor or pension

confidentiality, including information concerning the financial 
condition or funding of labor or pension organizations, or the financial 
condition of any individual, in conjunction with applications for 
exemption under 29 U.S.C. 504 and 1111, and information concerning 
income, assets and liabilities of inmates, and persons on supervision;
    (5) Involve accusing any person of a crime or formally censuring any 
person;
    (6) Disclose information of a personal nature, where disclosure 
would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
    (7) Disclose an investigatory record compiled for law enforcement 
purposes, or information derived from such a record, which describes the 
criminal history or associations of any person under the Commission's 
jurisdiction or which describes the involvement of any person in the 
commission of a crime, but only to the extent that the production of 
such records or information would:
    (i) Interfere with enforcement proceedings;
    (ii) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trail or an impartial 
adjudication;
    (iii) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
    (iv) Disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case 
of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the 
course of a criminal investigation, or an agency conducting a lawful 
national security intelligence investigation, confidential information 
furnished only by the confidential source;
    (v) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or
    (vi) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement 
personnel;
    (8) Disclose information, the premature disclosure of which would be 
likely to significantly frustrate implementation of proposed Commission 
action except where
    (i) The Commission has already publicly disclosed the content or 
nature of its proposed action or
    (ii) The Commission is required by law to make such disclosure on 
its own initiative prior to taking final Commission action on such 
proposal;

[[Page 382]]

    (9) Specifically concern the Commission's issuance of subpoena or 
participation in a civil action or proceeding; or
    (10) Specifically concern the initiation, conduct, or disposition of 
a particular case of formal adjudication pursuant to the procedures in 5 
U.S.C. 554, or of any case involving a determination on the record after

    (i) Record review hearings following opportunity for an in-person 
hearing pursuant to the procedures of 28 CFR 4.1 through 4.17 and 28 CFR 
4a.1 through 4a.17 \1\ (governing applications for certificates of

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Part 4a was removed at 44 FR 6890, Feb. 2, 1979.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) The initiation, conduct, or disposition by the Commission of 
any matter pursuant to the procedures of 28 CFR 2.1 through 2.58 
(parole, release, supervision, and recommitment of prisoners, youth 
offenders, and juvenile delinquents).
    (b) Public interest provision. Notwithstanding the exemptions at 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(10) of this section, the Commission may 
conduct a meeting or portion of a meeting in public when the Commission 
determines, in its discretion, that the public interest in an open 
meeting clearly outweighs the need for confidentiality.
    (c) Nonpublic matter in announcements. The Commission may delete 
from any announcement or notice required in these regulations 
information the disclosure of which would be likely to have any of the 
consequences described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(10) of this 
section, including the name of any individual considered by the 
Commission in any case of formal or informal adjudication.
    (d) Voting and certification. (1) A separate recorded vote of the 
Commission shall be taken with respect to each meeting or portion 
thereof which is proposed to be closed, and with respect to any 
information which is proposed to be withheld pursuant to this section. 
Voting by proxy shall not be permitted. In the alternative, the 
Commission may, by a single majority vote, close to public observation a 
series of meetings, or portion(s) thereof or withhold information 
concerning such series of meetings, provided that:
    (i) Each meeting in such series involves the same particular 
matters, and
    (ii) Each meeting is scheduled to be held no more than thirty days 
after the initial meeting in the series.
    (2) Upon the request of any Commissioner, the Commission shall make 
a determination as to closure pursuant to this subsection if any person 
whose interests may be directly affected by a portion of a meeting 
requests the Commission to close such portion or portions to the public 
observation for any of the grounds specified in paragraph (a) (5), (6) 
or (7) of this section.
    (3) The determination to close any meeting to public observation 
pursuant to this section shall be made at least one week prior to the 
meeting or the first of a series of meetings as the case may be. If a 
majority of the Commissioners determines by recorded vote that agency 
business requires the meeting to take place at any earlier date, the 
closure determination and announcement thereof shall be made at the 
earliest practicable time. Within one day of any vote taken on whether 
to close a meeting under this section, the Commission shall make 
available to the public a written record reflecting the vote of each 
Commissioner on the question, including a full written explanation of 
its action in closing the meeting, portion(s) thereof, or series of 
meetings, together with a list of all persons expected to attend the 
meeting(s) or portion(s) thereof and their affiliation, subject to the 
provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.
    (4) For every meeting or series of meetings closed pursuant to this 
section, the General Counsel of the Parole Commission shall publicly 
certify that, in Counsel's opinion, the meeting may be closed to the 
public and shall state each relevant exemptive provision.


<R05>
Sec. 16.204  Public notice.

    (a) Requirements. Every open meeting and meeting closed pursuant to 
Sec. 16.203

[[Page 383]]

shall be preceded by a public announcement posted before the main 
entrance to the Chairman's Office at the Commission's headquarters, 5550 
Friendship Boulevard, Chevy Chase, Maryland 20815-7286, and, in the case 
of a meeting held elsewhere, in a prominent place at the location in 
which the meeting will be held. Such announcement shall be transmitted 
to the Federal Register for publication and, in addition, may be issued 
through the Department of Justice, Office of Public Affairs, as a press 
release, or by such other means as the Commission shall deem reasonable 
and appropriate. The announcement shall furnish:
    (1) A brief description of the subject matter to be discussed;
    (2) The date, place, and approximate time of the meeting;
    (3) Whether the meeting will be open or closed to public 
observation; and
    (4) The name and telephone number of the official designated to 
respond to requests for information concerning the meeting. See Sec. 
16.205(d) for the notice requirement applicable to meetings closed 
pursuant to that section.
    (b) Time of notice. The announcement required by this section shall 
be released to the public at least one week prior to the meeting 
announced therein except where a majority of the members of the 
Commission determines by a recorded vote that Commission business 
requires earlier consideration. In the event of such a determination, 
the announcement shall be made at the earliest practicable time.
    (c) Amendments to notice. The time or place of a meeting may be 
changed following the announcement only if the Commission publicly 
announces such change at the earliest practicable time. The subject 
matter of a meeting, or determination of the Commission to open or close 
a meeting, or portion of a meeting, to the public may be changed 
following the announcement only if:
    (1) A majority of the entire membership of the Commission determines 
by a recorded vote that Commission business so requires and that no 
earlier announcement of the change was possible, and
    (2) The Commission publicly announces such change and the vote of 
each member upon such change at the earliest practicable time: Provided, 
That individual items which have been announced for Commission 
consideration at a closed meeting may be deleted without notice.

[42 FR 14713, Mar. 16, 1977 as amended by Order No. 960-81, 46 FR 52357, 
Oct. 27, 1981]


<R05>
Sec. 16.205  Closed meetings--Informal procedures.

    (a) Finding. Based upon a review of the meetings of the U.S. Parole 
Commission since the effective date of the Parole Commission and 
Reorganization Act (May 14, 1976), the regulations issued pursuant 
thereto (28 CFR part 2) the experience of the U.S. Board of Parole, and 
the regulations pertaining to the Commission's authority under 29 U.S.C. 
504 and 29 U.S.C. 1111 (28 CFR parts 4 and 4a), the Commission finds 
that the majority of its meetings may properly be closed to the public 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552 (d)(4) and (c)(10). The major part of normal 
Commission business lies in the adjudication of individual parole cases, 
all of which proceedings commence with an initial parole or revocation 
hearing and are determined on the record thereof.

Original jurisdiction cases are decided at bi-monthly meetings of the 
National Commissioners (28 CFR 2.17) and by the entire Commission in 
conjunction with each business meeting of the Commission (held at least 
quarterly) (28 CFR 2.27).

The National Appeals Board normally decides cases by sequential vote on 
a daily basis, but may meet from time to time for joint deliberations. 
In the period from October, 1975 through September, 1976, the National 
Appeals Board made 2,072 Appellate decisions.

Finally, over the last two years the Commission determined eleven cases 
under the Labor and Pension Acts, which are proceedings pursuant to 5 
U.S.C. 554. The only meetings of the Commission not of an adjudicative 
nature involving the most sensitive inquiry into the personal background 
and behavior of the individual concerned, or involving sensitive 
financial information concerning the parties before the Commission, are 
the normal business meetings of the Commission, which are held at least 
quarterly.

[[Page 384]]

    (b) Meetings to which applicable. The following types of meetings 
may be closed in the event that a majority of the Commissioners present 
at the meeting, and authorized to act on behalf of the Commission, votes 
by recorded vote at the beginning of each meeting or portion thereof, to 
close the meeting or portions thereof:
    (1) Original jurisdiction initial and appellate case deliberations 
conducted pursuant to 28 CFR 2.17 and 2.27;
    (2) National Appeals Board deliberations pursuant to 28 CFR 2.26;
    (3) Meetings of the Commission to conduct a hearing on the record 
regarding applications for certificates of exemption pursuant to the 
Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, 29 U.S.C. 504, 
and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. 1111 
(28 CFR 4.1-17 and 29 CFR 4a.1-17).\1\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Written record of action to close meeting. In the case of a 
meeting or portion of a meeting closed pursuant to this section, the 
Commission shall make available to the public as soon as practicable:
    (1) A written record reflecting the vote of each member of the 
Commission to close the meeting; and
    (2) A certification by the Commission's General Counsel to the 
effect that in Counsel's opinion, the meeting may be closed to the 
public, which certification shall state each relevant exemptive 
provision.
    (d) Public notice. In the case of meetings closed pursuant to this 
section the Commission shall make a public announcement of the subject 
matter to be considered, and the date, place, and time of the meeting. 
The announcement described herein shall be released to the public at the 
earliest practicable time.


<R05>
Sec. 16.206  Transcripts, minutes, and miscellaneous documents concerning 

Commission meetings.

    (a) In the case of any Commission meeting, whether open or closed, 
the Commission shall maintain and make available for public inspection a 
record of the final vote of each member on rules, statements of policy, 
and interpretations adopted by it: 18 U.S.C. 4203(d).
    (b) The Commission shall maintain a complete transcript or 
electronic recording adequate to record fully the proceedings of each 
meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the public pursuant to Sec. 
16.203. In the case of a meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the 
public pursuant to Sec. 16.205 of these regulations, the Commission may 
maintain either the transcript or recording described above, or a set of 
minutes unless a recording is required by title 18 U.S.C. 4208(f). The 
minutes required by this section shall fully and clearly describe all 
matters discussed and shall provide a full and accurate summary of any 
actions taken, and the reasons therefor, including a description of each 
of the views expressed on any item and the record of any rollcall vote 
(reflecting the vote of each Commissioner on the question). All 
documents considered in connection with any action shall be identified 
in such minutes.
    (c) The Commission shall retain a copy of every certification 
executed by the General Counsel's Office pursuant to these regulations, 
together with a statement from the presiding officer of the meeting, or 
portion of a meeting to which the certification applies, setting forth 
the time and place of the meeting, and the persons present.
    (d) Nothing herein shall affect any other provision in Commission 
procedures or regulations requiring the preparation and maintenance of a 
record of all official actions of the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 16.207  Public access to nonexempt transcripts and minutes of closed 

Commission meetings--Documents used at meetings--Record retention.

    (a) Public access to records. Within a reasonable time after any 
closed meeting, the Commission shall make available to the public, in 
the Commission's Public Reading Room located at 5550 Friendship 
Boulevard, Chevy Chase, Maryland 20815-7286, the transcript, electronic 
recording, or minutes of the discussion of any item on the agenda, or of 
any item of the testimony of any witness received at such meeting, 
maintained hereunder, except for such

[[Page 385]]

item or items of such discussion or testimony which contain information 
exempt under any provision of the Government in the Sunshine Act (Pub. 
L. 94-409), or of any amendment thereto. Copies of nonexempt 
transcripts, or minutes, or a transcription of such recording disclosing 
the identity of each speaker, shall be furnished to any person at the 
actual cost of duplication or transcription.
    (b) Access to documents identified or discussed in any Commission 
meeting, open or closed, shall be governed by Department of Justice 
regulations at this part 16, subparts C and D. The Commission reserves 
the right to invoke statutory exemptions to disclosure of such documents 
under 5 U.S.C. 552 and 552a, and applicable regulations. The exemptions 
provided in 5 U.S.C. 552b(c) shall apply to any request made pursuant to 
5 U.S.C. 552 or 552a to copy and inspect any transcripts, recordings or 
minutes prepared or maintained pursuant hereto.
    (c) Retention of records. The Commission shall maintain a complete 
verbatim copy of the transcript, or a complete copy of the minutes, or a 
complete electronic recording of each meeting, or portion of a meeting, 
closed to the public, for a period of at least two years after such 
meeting, or until one year after the conclusion of any Commission 
proceeding with respect to which the meeting or portion thereof was 
held, whichever occurs later.

<R05>
Sec. 16.300  Access to documents for the purpose of responding to an official 

inquiry.

    (a) To the extent permitted by law, former employees of the 
Department shall be given access to documents that they originated, 
reviewed, or signed while employees of the Department, for the purpose 
of responding to an official inquiry by a federal, state, or local 
government entity or professional licensing authority. Documents include 
memoranda, drafts, reports, notes, written communications, and documents 
stored electronically that are in the possession of the Department. 
Access ordinarily will be provided on government premises.
    (b) Requests for access to documents under this section must be

not be delegated below the level of principal deputy component head.
    (c) The written request should describe with specificity the 
documents to which access is sought (including time periods wherever 
possible), the reason for which access is sought (including the timing 
of the official inquiry involved), and any intended disclosure of any of 
the information contained in the documents.

<R05>
Sec. 17.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to ensure that information within the 
Department of Justice (the ``Department'') relating to the national 
security is classified, protected, and declassified pursuant to the 
provisions of Executive Orders 12958 (3 CFR, 1995 Comp., p. 333) and 
12968 (3 CFR, 1995 Comp., p. 391) and implementing directives from the 
Information Security Oversight Office of the National Archives and 
Records Administration (``ISOO''). Executive Orders 12958 and 12968 made 
numerous substantive changes in the system of classification, 
declassification, and downgrading of classified National Security 
Information and the criteria for access to this information. 
Accordingly, this part is a revision of the Department's classified 
information security rules.
    (a) Subpart A of this part prescribes the implementation of 
Executive Orders 12958 and 12968 within the Department through the 
Assistant Attorney General for Administration, as the senior responsible 
agency official. Subpart A of this part also provides for certain 
relationships within the Department between the Assistant Attorney 
General for Administration, other component heads, and the National 
Security Division.
    (b) Subpart B of this part prescribes an orderly and progressive 
system for ensuring that every necessary safeguard and procedure is in 
place to assure that information is properly classified and that 
classified information is protected from unauthorized disclosure. 
Subpart B of this part requires original classification authorities to 
make classification decisions based on specific criteria; provides that 
most newly created classified information be considered for 
declassification after 10 years; provides that historically valuable 
information that is more than 25 years old (including information 
classified under prior Executive Orders) be

[[Page 388]]

automatically declassified, with appropriate exceptions; and establishes 
procedures for authorized holders of classified information to challenge 
the classification of information.
    (c) Subpart C of this part establishes substantive standards and 
procedures for granting, denying, and revoking, and for appealing 
decisions to deny access to classified information with an emphasis on 
ensuring the consistent, cost-effective, and efficient protection of 
classified information. Subpart C of this part provides a process that 
is fair and equitable to those with whom classified information is 
entrusted and, at the same time, assures the security of the classified 
information.

[Order No. 2091-97, 62 FR 36984, July 10, 1997, as amended by Order No. 
2865-2007, 72 FR 10069, Mar. 7, 2007]


<R05>
Sec. 17.2  Scope.

    (a) All employees, contractors, grantees, and others granted access 
to classified information by the Department are governed by this part, 
and by the standards in Executive Order 12958, Executive Order 12968, 
and directives promulgated under those Executive Orders. If any portion 
of this part conflicts with any portion of Executive Order 12958, 
Executive Order 12968, or any successor Executive Order, the Executive 
Order shall apply. This part supersedes the former rule and any 
Department internal operating policy or directive that conflicts with 
any portion of this part.
    (b) This part applies to non-contractor personnel outside of the 
Executive Branch and to contractor personnel or employees who are 
entrusted with classified national security information originated 
within or in the custody of the Department. This part does not affect 
the operation of the Department's participation in the National 
Industrial Security Program under Executive Order 12829 (3 CFR, 1993 
Comp., p. 570).
    (c) This part is independent of and does not affect any 
classification procedures or requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 
1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq).
    (d) This part does not, and is not intended to, create any right to 
judicial review, or any other right or benefit or trust responsibility, 
substantive or procedural, enforceable by a party against the United 
States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or 
any other person. This part creates limited rights to administrative 
review of decisions pursuant to Sec. Sec. 17.30, 17.31, and 17.47. This 
part does not, and is not intended to, create any right to judicial 
review of administrative action under Sec. Sec. 17.14, 17.15, 17.18, 
17.27, 17.30, 17.31 and 17.50.

    (c) The Department Security Officer may grant, deny, suspend, or 
revoke employee access to classified information pursuant to and in 
accordance with Executive Order 12968. The Department Security Officer

Programs Managers when the operational need justifies the delegation and 
when the Department Security Officer is assured that such officials will 
apply all access criteria in a uniform and correct manner in accord with 
the provisions of Executive Order 12968 and subpart C of this part. The 
fact that a delegation has been made pursuant to this section does not 
waive the Department Security Officer's authority to make any 
determinations that have been delegated.
    (d) The Department Security Officer shall maintain a current list of 
all officials authorized pursuant to this part to originally classify or 
declassify documents.
    (e) The Department Security Officer shall promulgate criteria and 
security requirements for the marking and safeguarding of information,

<R05>
Sec. 17.17  Judicial proceedings.

    (a)(1) Any Department official or organization receiving an order or

Established Pursuant to Pub. L. 96-456, 94 Stat. 2025, by the Chief 
Justice of the United States

[[Page 392]]

for the Protection of Classified Information'' may be used in Federal 
criminal cases involving classified information. (Available from the 
Security and Emergency Planning Staff, Justice Management Division, 
Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530.)
    (c) In judicial proceedings other than Federal criminal cases where 
CIPA is used, the Department, through its attorneys, shall seek 
appropriate security safeguards to protect classified information from 
unauthorized disclosure, including, but not limited to, consideration of 
the following:
    (1) A determination by the court of the relevance and materiality of 
the classified information in question;
    (2) An order that classified information shall not be disclosed or 
introduced into evidence at a proceeding without the prior approval of 
either the originating agency, the Attorney General, or the President;
    (3) A limitation on attendance at any proceeding where classified 
information is to be disclosed to those persons with appropriate 
authorization to access classified information whose duties require 
knowledge or possession of the classified information to be disclosed;
    (4) A court facility that provides appropriate safeguarding for the 
classified information as determined by the Department Security Officer;
    (5) Dissemination and accountability controls for all classified 
information offered for identification or introduced into evidence at 
such proceedings;
    (6) Appropriate marking to indicate classified portions of any and 
any the maintenance of any classified under seal;
    (7) Handling and storage of all classified information including 
classified portions of any transcript in a manner consistent with the 
provisions of this regulation and Department implementing directives;
    (8) Return at the conclusion of the proceeding of all classified 
information to the Department or the originating agency, or placing the 
classified information under court seal;
    (9) Retrieval by Department employees of appropriate notes, drafts, 
or any other documents generated during the course of the proceedings 
that contain classified information and immediate transfer to the 
Department for safeguarding and destruction as appropriate; and
    (10) Full and complete advice to all persons to whom classified 
information is disclosed during such proceedings as to the 
classification level of such information, all pertinent safeguarding and 
storage requirements, and their liability in the event of unauthorized 
disclosure.
    (d) Access to classified information by individuals involved in 
judicial proceedings other than employees of the Department is governed 
by Sec. 17.46(c).


<R05>
Sec. 17.18  Prepublication review.

    (a) All individuals with authorized access to Sensitive 
Compartmented Information shall be required to sign nondisclosure 
agreements containing a provision for prepublication review to assure 
deletion of Sensitive Compartmented Information and other classified 
information. Sensitive Compartmented Information is information that not 
only is classified for national security reasons as Top Secret, Secret, 
or Confidential, but also is subject to special access and handling 
requirements because it involves or derives from particularly sensitive 
intelligence sources and methods. The prepublication review provision 
will require Department of Justice employees and other individuals who 
are authorized to have access to Sensitive Compartmented Information to 
submit certain material, described further in the agreement, to the 
Department prior to its publication to provide an opportunity for 
determining whether an unauthorized disclosure of Sensitive 
Compartmented Information or other classified information would occur as 
a consequence of it publication.
    (b) Persons subject to these requirements are invited to discuss 
their plans for public disclosures of information that may be subject to 
these obligations with authorized Department representatives at an early 
stage, or as soon as circumstances indicate these policies must be 
considered. Except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section

[[Page 393]]

for FBI personnel, all questions concerning these obligations should be 
addressed to the Assistant Attorney General for National Security, 
Department of Justice, 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 
20530. The official views of the Department on whether specific 
materials require prepublication review may be expressed only by the 
Assistant Attorney General for National Security and persons should not 
act in reliance upon the views of other Department personnel.
    (c) Prepublication review is required only as expressly provided for 
in a nondisclosure agreement. However, all persons who have had access 
to classified information have an obligation to avoid unauthorized 
disclosures of such information. Therefore, persons who have such access 
but are not otherwise required to submit to prepublication review under 
the terms of an employment or other nondisclosure agreement are 
encouraged to submit material for prepublication review voluntarily if 
they believe that such material may contain classified information.
    (d) The nature and extent of the material that is required to be 
submitted for prepublication review under nondisclosure agreements is 
expressly provided for in those agreements. It should be clear, however, 
that such requirements do not extend to any materials that exclusively 
contain information lawfully obtained at a time when the author has no 
employment, contract, or other relationship with the United States 
Government or that contain information exclusively acquired outside the 
scope of employment.
    (e) A person's obligation to submit material for prepublication 
review remains identical whether such person prepares the materials or 
causes or assists another person (such as a ghost writer, spouse, 
friend, or editor) in preparing the material. Material covered by a 
nondisclosure agreement requiring prepublication review must be 
submitted prior to discussing it with or showing it to a publisher, co-
author, or any other person who is not authorized to have access to it. 
In this regard, it should be noted that a failure to submit such 
material for prepublication review constitutes a breach of the 
obligation and exposes the author to remedial action even in cases where 
the published material does not actually contain Sensitive Compartmented 
Information or classified information. See Snepp v. United States, 444 
U.S. 507 (1980).
    (f) The requirement to submit material for prepublication review is 
not limited to any particular type of material or disclosure or methods 
of production. Written materials include not only book manuscripts but 
all other forms of written materials intended for public disclosure, 
such as (but not limited to) newspaper columns, magazine articles, 
letters to the editor, book reviews, pamphlets, scholarly papers, and 
fictional material.
    (g) Oral statements are also within the scope of a prepublication 
review requirement when based upon written materials, such as an outline 
of the statements to be made. There is no requirement to prepare written 
materials for review, however, unless there is reason to believe in 
advance that oral statements may contain Sensitive Compartmented 
Information or other information required to be submitted for review 
under the terms of the nondisclosure agreement. Thus, a person may 
participate in an oral presentation where there is no opportunity for 
prior preparation (e.g., news interview, panel discussion) without 
violating the provisions of this paragraph.
    (h) Material submitted for republication review will be reviewed 
solely for the purpose of identifying and preventing the disclosure of 
Sensitive Compartmented Information and other classified information. 
This review will be conducted in an impartial manner without regard to 
whether the material is critical of or favorable to the Department. No 
effort will be made to delete embarrassing or critical statements that 
are unclassified. Materials submitted for review will be disseminated to 
other persons or agencies only to the extent necessary to identify 
classified information.
    (i) The Assistant Attorney General for National Security or a 
designee (or,

[[Page 394]]

in the case of FBI employees, the Section Chief, Records/Information 
Dissemination Section, Records Management Division) will respond 
substantively to prepublication review requests within 30 working days 
of receipt of the submission. Priority shall be given to reviewing 
speeches, newspaper articles, and other materials that the author seeks 
to publish on an expedited basis. The Assistant Attorney General's 
decisions may be appealed to the Deputy Attorney General, who will 
process appeals within 15 days of receipt of the appeal. The Deputy 
Attorney General's decision is final and not subject to further 
administrative appeal. Persons who are dissatisfied with the final 
administrative decision may obtain judicial review either by filing an 
action for declaratory relief, or by giving the Department notice of 
their intention to proceed with publication despite the Department's 
request for deletions of classified information and giving the 
Department 30 working days to file a civil action seeking a court order 
prohibiting disclosure. Employees and other affected individuals remain 
obligated not to disclose or publish information determined by the 
Government to be classified until any civil action is resolved.
    (j) The obligations of Department of Justice employees described in 
this subpart apply with equal force to employees of the FBI with 
following exceptions and provisos:
    (1) Nothing in this subpart shall supersede or alter obligations 
assumed under the basic FBI employment agreement.
    (2) FBI employees required to sign nondisclosure agreements 
containing a provision for prepublication review pursuant to this 
subpart shall submit materials for review to the Section Chief, Records/
Information Dissemination Section, Records Management Division. Such 
individuals shall also submit questions as to whether specific materials 
require prepublication review under such agreements to that Section for 
resolution. Where such questions raise policy questions or concern 
significant issues of interpretation under such an agreement, the 
Section Chief, Records/Information Dissemination Section, Records 
Management Division, shall consult with the Assistant Attorney General 
for National Security, or a designee, prior to responding to the 
inquiry.
    (3) Decisions of the Section Chief, Records/Information 
Dissemination Section, Records Management Division, concerning the 
deletion of classified information, may be appealed to the Director, 
FBI, who will process appeals within 15 working days of receipt. Persons 
who are dissatisfied with the Director's decision may, at their option, 
appeal further to the Deputy Attorney General as provided in paragraph 
(i) of this section. Judicial review, as set forth in that paragraph, is 
available following final agency action in the form of a decision by the 
Director, if the appeal process in paragraph (i) of this section is 
pursued, the Deputy Attorney General.

                    Subpart B_Classified Information


<R05>
Sec. 17.21  Classification and declassification authority.

    (a) Top Secret original classification authority may only be 
exercised by the Attorney General, the Assistant Attorney General for 
Administration, and officials to whom such authority is delegated in 
writing by the Attorney General. No official who is delegated Top Secret 
classification authority pursuant to this paragraph may redelegate such 
authority.
    (b) The Assistant Attorney General for Administration may delegate 
original Secret and Confidential classification authority to subordinate 
officials determined to have frequent need to exercise such authority. 
No official who is delegated original classification authority pursuant 
to this paragraph may redelegate such authority.
    (c) Officials authorized to classify information at a specified 
level are also authorized to classify information at a lower level. In 
the absence of an official authorized to exercise classification 
authority pursuant to this section, the person designated to act in lieu 
of such official may exercise the official's classification authority.

[[Page 395]]


<R05>
Sec. 17.22  Classification of information; limitations.

    (a) Information may be originally classified only if all of the 
following standards are met:
    (1) The information is owned by, produced by or for, or is under the 
control of the United States Government;
    (2) The information falls within one or more of the categories of 
information specified in section 1.5 of Executive Order 12958; and
    (3) The classifying official determines that the unauthorized 
disclosure of the information reasonably could be expected to result in 
damage to the national security and such official is able to identify or 
describe the damage.
    (b) Information may be classified as Top Secret, Secret, or 
Confidential according to the standards established in section 1.3 of 
Executive Order 12958. No other terms shall be used to identify United 
States classified national security information except as otherwise 
provided by statute.
    (c) Information shall not be classified if there is significant 
doubt about the need to classify the information. If there is 
significant doubt about the appropriate level of classification with 
respect to information that is being classified, it shall be classified 
at the lower classification of the levels considered.
    (d) Information shall not be classified in order to conceal 
inefficiency, violations of law, or administrative error; to prevent 
embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency; to restrain 
competition; or to prevent or delay release of information that does not 
require protection in the interest of national security. Information 
that has been declassified and released to the public under proper 
authority may not be reclassified.
    (e) Information that has not previously been disclosed to the public 
under proper authority may be classified or reclassified after the 
Department has received a request for it under the Freedom of 
Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), 
or the mandatory review provisions of Sec. 17.31. When it is necessary 
to classify or reclassify such information, it shall be forwarded to the 
Department Security Officer and classified or reclassified only at the 
direction of the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, or the 
Assistant Attorney General for Administration.
    (f) Compilations of items of information that are individually 
unclassified may be classified if the compiled information reveals an 
additional association or relationship that meets the standards for 
classification under Executive Order 12958 and that is not otherwise 
revealed in the individual items of information.


<R05>
Sec. 17.23  Emergency classification requests.

    (a) Whenever any employee, contractor, licensee, certificate holder, 
or grantee of the Department who does not have original classification 
authority originates or develops information that requires immediate 
classification and safeguarding, and no authorized classifier is 
available, that person shall:
    (1) Safeguard the information in a manner appropriate for its 
classification level;
    (2) Apply the appropriate overall classification markings; and
    (3) Within five working days, securely transmit the information to 
the organization that has appropriate subject matter interest and 
classification authority.
    (b) When it is not clear which Department organization would be the 
appropriate original classifier, the information shall be sent to the 
Department Security Officer to determine the appropriate organization.
    (c) The organization with classification authority shall decide 
within 30 days whether to classify information.


<R05>
Sec. 17.24  Duration of classification.

    (a) At the time of original classification, original classification 
authorities shall attempt to establish a specific date or event for 
declassification not more than 10 years from the date of the original 
decision based on the duration of the national security sensitivity of 
the information. If the original classification authority cannot 
determine an earlier specific date or event for declassification, the 
information shall be marked for declassification 10 years from the date 
of the original decision.

[[Page 396]]

    (b) At the time of original classification, an original 
classification authority may exempt specific information from 
declassification within 10 years in accordance with section 1.6(d) of 
Executive Order 12958.
    (c) An original classification authority may extend the duration of 
classification or reclassify specific information for successive periods 
not to exceed 10 years at a time if such action is consistent with the 
standards and procedures established under, and subject to the 
limitations of, Executive Order 12958.


<R05>
Sec. 17.25  Identification and markings.

    (a) Classified information must be marked pursuant to the standards 
set forth in section 1.7 of Executive Order 12958; ISOO implementing 
directives in 32 CFR 2001, subpart B; and internal Department of Justice 
direction provided by the Department Security Officer.
    (b) Foreign government information shall be marked or classified at 
a level equivalent to that level of classification assigned by the 
originating foreign government.
    (c) Information assigned a level of classification under predecessor 
Executive Orders shall be considered as classified at that level of 
classification.


<R05>
Sec. 17.26  Derivative classification.

    (a) Persons need not possess original classification authority to 
derivatively classify information based on source documents or 
classification guides.
    (b) Persons who apply derivative classification markings shall 
observe original classification decisions and carry forward to any newly 
created documents the pertinent classification markings.
    (c) Information classified derivatively from other classified 
information shall be classified and marked in accordance with the 
standards set forth in sections 2.1-2.3 of Executive Order 12958, the 
ISOO implementing directives in 32 CFR 2001.22, and internal Department 
directions provided by the Department Security Officer.


<R05>
Sec. 17.27  Declassification and downgrading.

    (a) Classified information shall be declassified as soon as it no 
longer meets the standards for classification. Declassification and 
downgrading is governed by Sec. 3.1-3.3 of Executive Order 12958, 
implementing ISOO directives at 32 CFR 2001, subpart E, and applicable 
internal Department of Justice direction provided by the Department 
Security Officer.
    (b) Information shall be declassified or downgraded by the official 
who authorized the original classification if that official is still 
serving in the same position, the originator's successor, or a 
supervisory official of either, or by officials delegated such authority 
in writing by the Attorney General or the Assistant Attorney General for 
Administration.
    (c) It is presumed that information that continues to meet the 
classification requirements under Executive Order 12958 requires 
continued protection. In some exceptional cases during declassification 
reviews, the need to protect classified information may be outweighed by 
the public interest in disclosure of the information, and in these cases 
the information should be declassified. If it appears that the public 
interest in disclosure of the information may outweigh the need to 
protect the information, the declassification reviewing official shall 
refer the case with a recommendation for decision to the DRC. The DRC 
shall review the case and make a recommendation to the Attorney General 
on whether the public interest in disclosure outweighs the damage to 
national security that might reasonably be expected from disclosure. The 
Attorney General shall decide whether to declassify the information. The 
decision of the Attorney General shall be final. This provision does not 
amplify or modify the substantive criteria or procedures for 
classification or create any substantive or procedural rights subject to 
judicial review.
    (d) Each component shall develop schedules for declassification of 
records in the National Archives. The Department shall cooperate with 
the National Archives and Records Administration and the Presidential 
Libraries

[[Page 397]]

to ensure that declassification is accomplished in a timely manner.


<R05>
Sec. 17.28  Automatic declassification.

    (a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, all classified 
information contained in records that are more than 25 years old that 
have been determined to have permanent historical value shall be 
declassified automatically on April 17, 2000. Subsequently, all 
classified information in such records shall be automatically 
declassified not later than 25 years after the date of its original 
classification with the exception of specific information exempt from 
automatic declassification pursuant to section 3.4 (b) and (d) of 
Executive Order 12958.
    (b) At least 220 days before information is declassified 
automatically under this section, the respective component head shall 
notify the Assistant Attorney General for Administration through the 
Department Security Officer of any specific information they propose to 
exempt from automatic declassification. The notification shall include:
    (1) A description of the information;
    (2) An explanation of why the information is exempt from automatic 
declassification and must remain classified for a longer period of time; 
and
    (3) A specific date or event for declassification of the information 
whenever the information exempted does not identify a confidential human 
source or human intelligence source.
    (c) Proposed exemptions under this section shall be forwarded to the 
DRC, which shall recommend a disposition of the exemption request to the 
Assistant Attorney General for Administration. When the Assistant 
Attorney General for Administration determines the exemption request is 
consistent with this section, he or she will submit it to the Executive 
Secretary of the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel.
    (d) Declassification guides that narrowly and precisely define 
exempted information may be used to exempt information from automatic 
declassification. Declassification guides must include the exemption 
notification information detailed in paragraph (b) of this section, and 
be approved pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 17.29  Documents of permanent historical value.

    The original classification authority, to the greatest extent 
possible, shall declassify classified information contained in records 
determined to have permanent historical value under title 44 of the 
United States Code before they are accessioned into the National 
Archives. The Department shall cooperate with the National Archives and 
Records Administration in carrying out an automatic declassification 
program involving accessioned Department records, presidential papers, 
and historical materials under the control of the Archivist of the 
United States.


<R05>
Sec. 17.30  Classification challenges.

    (a) Authorized holders of information classified by the Department 
who, in good faith, believe that specific information is improperly 
classified or unclassified are encouraged and expected to challenge the 
classification status of that information pursuant to section 1.9 of 
Executive Order 12958. Authorized holders may submit classification 
challenges in writing to the DRC, through the Office of Information and 
Privacy, United States Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530. The 
challenge need not be more specific than a question as to why the 
information is or is not classified, or is classified at a certain 
level.
    (b) The DRC shall redact the identity of an individual challenging a 
classification under paragraph (a) of this section and forward the 
classification challenge to the original classification authority for 
review and response.
    (c) The original classification authority shall promptly, and in no 
case later than 30 days, provide a written response to the DRC. The 
original classification authority may classify or declassify the 
information subject to challenge or state specific reasons why the 
original classification determination was proper. If the original 
classification authority is not able to response within 30 days, the DRC 
shall inform the individual who filed the challenge in writing of that 
fact, and the anticipated determination date.
    (d) The DRC shall inform the individual challenging the 
classification of the determination made by the original

[[Page 398]]

classification authority and that individual may appeal this 
determination to the DRC. Upon appeal, the DRC may declassify, or direct 
the classification of, the information. If the DRC is not able to act on 
any appeal within 45 days of receipt, the DRC shall inform the 
individual who filed the challenge in writing of that fact, and the 
anticipated determination date.
    (e) The DRC shall provide the individual who appeals a 
classification challenge determination with a written explanation of the 
basis for the DRC decision and a statement of his or her right to appeal 
that determination to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals 
Panel (ISCAP) pursuant to section 5.4 of Executive Order 12958 and the 
rules issued by the ISCAP pursuant to section 5.4 of Executive Order 
12958.
    (f) Any individual who challenges a classification and believes that 
any action has been taken against him or her in retribution because of 
that challenge shall report the facts to the Office of the Inspector 
General or the Office of Professional Responsibility, as appropriate.
    (g) Requests for review of classified material for declassification 
by persons other than authorized holders are governed by Sec. 17.31.


<R05>
Sec. 17.31  Mandatory review for declassification requests.

    (a) Any person may request classified information be reviewed for 
declassification pursuant to the mandatory declassification review 
provisions of section 3.6 of Executive Order 12958. After such a review, 
the information or any reasonably segregable portion thereof that no 
longer requires protection under this part shall be declassified and 
released to the requester unless withholding is otherwise warranted 
under applicable law. If the information, although declassified, is 
withheld, the requester shall be given a brief statement as to the 
reasons for denial and a notice of the right to appeal the determination 
to the Director, Office of Information and Privacy (OIP), United States 
Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530. If the mandatory review for 
declassification request relates to the classification of information 
that has been reviewed for declassification within the past two years or 
that is the subject of pending litigation, the requester shall be 
informed of that fact and the administrative appeal rights.
    (b) Request for mandatory review for declassification and any 
subsequent appeal to the DRC shall be submitted to the Director, Office 
of Information and Privacy, United States Department of Justice, 
Washington, DC 20530, describing the document or material containing the 
information with sufficient specificity to enable the Department to 
locate that information with a reasonable amount of effort. The OIP 
shall promptly forward the request to the component that originally 
classified the information, or the DRC in the case of an appeal, and 
provide the requester with an acknowledgement of receipt of the request.
    (c) When the description of the information in a request is 
deficient, the component shall solicit as much additional identifying 
information as possible from the requestor. Before denying a request on 
the basis that the information or material is not obtainable with a 
reasonable amount of effort, the component shall ask the requestor to 
limit the request to information or material that is reasonably 
obtainable. If the information or material requested cannot be described 
in sufficient particularity, or if it cannot be obtained with a 
reasonable amount of effort, the component shall provide the requestor 
with written notification of the reasons why no action will be taken and 
the right to appeal the decision to the DRC.
    (d) The component that originally classified the information shall 
provide a written response to requests for mandatory review within 60 
days whenever possible, or shall inform the requester in writing why 
additional time is needed. Unless there are unusual circumstances, the 
additional time needed by the component originally classifying the 
information shall not extend beyond 180 days from the receipt of the 
request. If no determination has been made at the end of the 180 day 
period, the requester may apply to the DRC for a determination.
    (e) If the component that originally classified the information 
determines

[[Page 399]]

that continued classification is warranted, it shall notify the 
requester in writing of the decision and the right to appeal the 
decision to the DRC no later that 60 days after receipt of the 
notification of the decision.
    (f) The DRC shall determine the appeals of the components' mandatory 
declassification review decisions within 60 days after receipt of the 
appeal, or notify the requester why additional time is needed. In making 
its determinations concerning requests for declassification of 
classified information, the DRC, for administrative purposes, shall 
impose the burden of proof on the originating component to show that 
continued classification is warranted. The DRC shall provide the 
requester with a written statement of reasons for its decisions.
    (g) If the individual requesting review of a classification is not 
satisfied with the DRC's decision, he or she may appeal to the ISCAP 
pursuant to section 5.4 of Executive Order 12958 and rules issued by the 
ISCAP pursuant to that section.


<R05>
Sec. 17.32  Notification of classification changes.

    All known holders of information affected by unscheduled 
classification changes actions shall be notified promptly of such 
changes by the original classifier or the authority making the change in 
classification.


<R04>
               Subpart C_Access to Classified Information


<R05>
Sec. 17.41  Access to classified information.

    (a) No person may be given access to classified information or 
material originated by, in the custody, or under the control of the 
Department, unless the person--
    (1) Has been determined to be eligible for access in accordance with 
sections 3.1-3.3 of Executive Order 12968;
    (2) Has a demonstrated need-to-know; and
    (3) Has signed an approved nondisclosure agreement.
    (b) Eligibility for access to classified information is limited to 
United States citizens for whom an appropriate investigation of their 
personal and professional history affirmatively indicated loyalty to the 
United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from 
conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and 
ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and 
protection of classified information. A determination of eligibility for 
access to classified information is a discretionary security decision 
based on judgments by appropriately trained adjudicative personnel. 
Eligibility shall be granted only where facts and circumstances indicate 
access to classified information is clearly consistent with the national 
security interests of the United States and any doubt shall be resolved 
in favor of the national security. Sections 2.6 and 3.3 of Executive 
Order 12968 provide only limited exceptions to these requirements.
    (c) The Department of Justice does not discriminate on the basis of 
race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or sexual 
orientation in granting access to classified information. However, the 
Department may investigate and consider any matter that relates to the 
determination of whether access is clearly consistent with the interests 
of national security. No negative inferences concerning the standards 
for access may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation 
of the employee or mental health counseling.
    (d) An employee granted access to classified information may be 
investigated at any time to ascertain whether he or she continues to 
meet the requirements for access.
    (e) An employee granted access to classified information shall 
provide to the Department written consent permitting access by an 
authorized investigative agency, for such time as access to classified 
information is maintained and for a period of three years thereafter, 
to:
    (1) Financial records maintained by a financial institution as 
defined in 31 U.S.C. 5312(a) or by a holding company as defined in 12 
U.S.C. 3401;
    (2) Consumer reports under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 
1681 et seq.); and

[[Page 400]]

    (3) Records maintained by commercial entities within the United 
States pertaining to any travel by the employee outside the United 
States.
    (f) Information may be requested pursuant to the employee consent 
obtained under paragraph (e) of this section only where:
    (1) There are reasonable grounds to believe, based on credible 
information, that the employee or former employee is, or may be, 
disclosing classified information in an unauthorized manner to a foreign 
power or agent of a foreign power;
    (2) Information the Department deems credible indicates the employee 
or former employee has incurred excessive indebtedness or has acquired a 
level of affluence that cannot be explained by other information; or
    (3) Circumstances indicate that the employee or former employee had 
the capability and opportunity to disclose classified information that 
is known to have been lost or compromised to a foreign power or an agent 
of a foreign power.


<R05>
Sec. 17.42  Positions requiring financial disclosure.

    (a) The Assistant Attorney General for Administration, in 
consultation with the Assistant Attorney General for National Security, 
shall designate each employee, by position or category where possible, 
who has a regular need for access to any of the categories of classified 
information described in section 1.3(a) of Executive Order 12968.
    (b) An employee may not hold a position designated as requiring a 
regular need for access to categories of classified information 
described in section 1.3(a) of Executive Order 12968 unless, as a 
condition of access to such information, the employee files with the 
Department Security Officer:
    (1) A financial disclosure form developed pursuant to section 1.3(c) 
of Executive Order 12968 as part of all background investigations or 
reinvestigations;
    (2) The same financial disclosure form, if selected by the 
Department Security Officer on a random basis; and
    (3) Relevant information concerning foreign travel, as determined by 
the Department Security Officer.

[Order No. 2091-97, 62 FR 36984, July 10, 1997, as amended by Order No. 
2865-2007, 72 FR 10069, Mar. 7, 2007]


<R05>
Sec. 17.43  Reinvestigation requirements.

    Employees who are eligible for access to classified information 
shall be subject to periodic reinvestigations and may also be 
reinvestigated if, at any time, there is reason to believe that they may 
no longer meet the standards for access.


<R05>
Sec. 17.44  Access eligibility.

    (a) Determinations of eligibility for access to classified 
information are separate from suitability determinations with respect to 
the hiring or retention of persons for employment by the Department or 
any other personnel actions.
    (b) The number of employees eligible for access to classified 
information shall be kept to the minimum required for the conduct of 
Department functions.
    (c) Eligibility for access to classified information shall be 
limited to classification levels for which there is a need for access. 
No person shall be granted eligibility higher than his or her need.


<R05>
Sec. 17.45  Need-to-know.

    No person shall be granted access to specific classified information 
unless that person has an actual need-to-know that classified 
information, pursuant to section 2.5 of Executive Order 12968.


<R05>
Sec. 17.46  Access by persons outside the Executive Branch.

    (a) Classified information shall not be disseminated outside the 
Executive Branch except under conditions that ensure that the 
information will be given protection equivalent to that afforded within 
the Executive Branch.
    (b) Classified information originated by or in the custody of the 
Department may be made available to individuals or agencies outside the 
Executive Branch provided that such information is necessary for 
performance of a function from which the Federal Government will derive 
a benefit or advantage and that the release is not prohibited

[[Page 401]]

by the originating department or agency (or foreign government in the 
case of Foreign Government Information). Before such a release is made, 
the head of the Office, Board, Division, or Bureau making the release 
shall determine the propriety of such action, in the interest of the 
national security, and must approve the release. Prior to the release, 
the Department Security Officer must confirm that the recipient is 
eligible for access to the classified information involved and agrees to 
safeguard the information in accordance with the provisions of this 
part.
    (c) Members of Congress, Justices of the United States Supreme 
Court, and Judges of the United States Courts of Appeal and District 
Courts do not require a determination of their eligibility for access to 
classified information by the Department. Federal Magistrate Judges must 
be determined eligible for access to classified information by the 
Department Security Officer pursuant to procedures approved by the 
Assistant Attorney General for Administration in consultation with the 
Judicial Conference of the United States. All other Legislative and 
Judicial personnel including, but not limited to, congressional staff, 
court reporters, typists, secretaries, law clerks, and translators who 
require access to classified information must be determined eligible by 
the Department Security Officer consistent with standards established in 
this regulation.
    (d) When other persons outside the Executive Branch who are not 
subject to the National Industrial Security Program require access to 
classified information originated by or in the custody of the 
Department, but do not otherwise possess a proper access authorization, 
an appropriate background investigation must be completed to allow the 
Department Security Officer to determine their eligibility for access to 
classified information. The length of time it generally takes to 
complete an expedited background investigation is 90 days. Therefore, 
all persons requiring access to classified information to participate in 
congressional or judicial proceedings should be identified and the 
background investigation initiated far enough in advance to ensure a 
minimum impact on such proceedings.
    (e) Personnel who are subject to a Department contract or grant or 
who are rendering consultant services to the Department and require 
access to classified information originated by or in the custody of the 
Department shall be processed for such access pursuant to procedures 
approved by the Assistant Attorney General for Administration.
    (f)(1) The requirement that access to classified information may be 
granted only as is necessary for the performance of official duties may 
be waived, pursuant to section 4.5(a) of Executive Order 12958, for 
persons who:
    (i) Are engaged in historical research projects; or
    (ii) Have previously occupied policymaking positions to which they 
were appointed by the President.
    (2) All persons receiving access pursuant to this paragraph (f) must 
have been determined to be trustworthy by the Department Security 
Officer as a precondition before receiving access. Such determinations 
shall be based on such investigation as the Department Security Officer 
deems appropriate. Historical researchers and former presidential 
appointees shall not have access to Foreign Government Information 
without the written permission from an appropriate authority of the 
foreign government concerned.
    (3) Waivers of the ``need-to-know'' requirement under this paragraph 
(f) may be granted by the Department Security Officer provided that the 
Security Programs Manager of the Office, Board, Division, or Bureau with 
classification jurisdiction over the information being sought:
    (i) Makes a written determination that such access is consistent 
with the interest of national security;
    (ii) Limits such access to specific categories of information over 
which the Department has classification jurisdiction;
    (iii) Maintains custody of the classified information at a 
Department facility;
    (iv) Obtains the recipient's written and signed agreement to 
safeguard the information in accordance with the provisions of this 
regulation and to authorize a review of any notes and manuscript for 
determination that no

[[Page 402]]

classified information is contained therein; and
    (v) In the case of former presidential appointees, limits their 
access to items that such former appointees originated, reviewed, 
signed, or received while serving as a presidential appointee and 
ensures that such appointee does not remove or cause to be removed any 
classified information reviewed.
    (4) If access requested by historical researchers and former 
presidential appointees requires the rendering of services for which 
fair and equitable fees may be charged pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 9701, the 
requester shall be so notified and fees may be imposed.


<R05>
Sec. 17.47  Denial or revocation of eligibility for access to classified 

information.

    (a) Applicants and employees who are determined to not meet the 
standards for access to classified information established in section 
3.1 of Executive order 12968 shall be:
    (1) Provided with a comprehensive and detailed written explanation 
of the basis for that decision as the national security interests of the 
United States and other applicable law permit and informed of their 
right to be represented by counsel or other representative at their own 
expense;
    (2) Permitted 30 days from the date of the written explanation to 
request any documents, records, or reports including the entire 
investigative file upon which a denial or revocation is based; and
    (3) Provided copies of documents requested pursuant to this 
paragraph (a) within 30 days of the request to the extent such documents 
would be provided if requested under the Freedom of Information Act (5 
U.S.C. 552) or the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), and as the 
national security interests and other applicable law permit.
    (b) An applicant or employee may file a written reply and request 
for review of the determination within 30 days after written 
notification of the determination or receipt of the copies of the 
documents requested pursuant to this subpart, whichever is later.
    (c) An applicant or employee shall be provided with a written notice 
of and reasons for the results of the review, the identity of the 
deciding authority, and written notice of the right to appeal.
    (d) Within 30 days of receipt of a determination under paragraph (c) 
of this section, the applicant or employee may appeal that determination 
in writing to the ARC, established under Sec. 17.15. The applicant or 
employee may request an opportunity to appear personally before the ARC 
and to present relevant documents, materials, and information.
    (e) An applicant or employee may be represented in any such appeal 
by an attorney or other representative of his or her choice, at his or 
her expense. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the 
Department to grant such attorney or other representative eligibility 
for access to classified information, or to disclose to such attorney or 
representative, or permit the applicant or employee to disclose to such 
attorney or representative, classified information.
    (f) A determination of eligibility for access to classified 
information by the ARC is a discretionary security decision. Decisions 
of the ARC shall be in writing and shall be made as expeditiously as 
possible. Access shall be granted only where facts and circumstances 
indicate that access to classified information is clearly consistent 
with the national security interest of the United States, and any doubt 
shall be resolved in favor of the national security.
    (g) The Department Security Officer shall have an opportunity to 
present relevant information in writing or, if the applicant or employee 
appears personally, in person. Any such written submissions shall be 
made part of the applicant's or employee's security record and, as the 
national security interests of the United States and other applicable 
law permit, shall also be provided to the applicant or employee. Any 
personal presentations shall be, to the extent consistent with the 
national security and other applicable law, in the presence of the 
applicant or employee.
    (h) When the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General personally 
certifies that a procedure set forth in

[[Page 403]]

this section cannot be made available in a particular case without 
damaging the national security interests of the United States by 
revealing classified information, the particular procedure shall not be 
made available. This is a discretionary and final decision not subject 
to further review.
    (i) This section does not limit the authority of the Attorney 
General pursuant to any other law or Executive Order to deny or 
terminate access to classified information if the national security so 
requires and the Attorney General determines that the appeal procedures 
set forth in this section cannot be invoked in a manner that is 
consistent with the national security. Nothing in this section requires 
that the Department provide any procedures under this section to an 
applicant where a conditional offer of employment is withdrawn for 
reasons of suitability or any reason other than denial of eligibility 
for access to classified information. Suitability determinations shall 
not be used for the purpose of denying an applicant or employee the 
review proceedings of this section where there has been a denial or 
revocation of eligibility for access to classified information.

determine whether a grantee has failed to comply with the terms of the 
statute under which the grant was awarded, agency regulations or the 
terms and conditions of the grant. The responsible agency may, in its 
discretion, conduct an investigation into the matter and, if warranted,

judge.
    (b) If the hearing officer appointed is unacceptable to the 
appellant, it shall promptly inform the responsible agency official of 
the reasons for its position. The responsible agency official may select 
another hearing officer, or affirm the initial selection. In either 
case, the official shall inform the appellant of the reasons for the 
decision.
    (c) The hearing officer shall have the following powers and duties:

[[Page 406]]

    (1) The power to hold hearings and regulate the course of the 
hearings and the conduct of the parties and their counsel;
    (2) The power to sign and issue subpoenas and other orders requiring 
access to records;
    (3) The power to administer oaths and affirmations;
    (4) The power to examine witnesses;

    (6) The power to take depositions or to cause depositions to be 
taken;
    (7) The power to hold conferences under Sec. 18.6(d) for the 
settlement or simplification of the issues or for any other proper 
purpose;
    (8) The power to consider and rule upon procedural requests and 
other motions, including motions for default;
    (9) The duty to conduct fair and impartial hearings;
    (10) The duty to maintain order;
    (11) The duty to avoid unnecessary delay; and
    (12) All powers and duties reasonably necessary to perform the 
functions enumerated in subsections (1)-(11).
    (d) The hearing officer may call upon the parties to consider:
    (1) Simplification or clarification of the issues;
    (2) Stipulations, admissions, agreements on documents, or other 
understandings which will expedite conduct of the hearing;
    (3) Limitation of the number of witnesses and of cumulative 
evidence;
    (4) Settlement of all or part of the issues in dispute;

    (g) The responsible agency shall have the burden of going forward 
with the evidence and shall generally present its evidence first.
    (h) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings 
conducted pursuant to this part, but rules designed to assure production 
of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to 
cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the 
hearing officer. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, 
or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered 
or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties, and 
opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on 
either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral 
evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for 
the record.
    (i) During the time a proceeding is before a hearing officer, all 
motions shall be addressed to the hearing officer and, if within his or 
her delegated authority, shall be ruled upon. Any motion upon which the 
hearing officer has no authority to rule shall be certified to the 
responsible agency official with a recommendation. The opposing party 
may answer within such time as may be designated by the hearing officer. 
The hearing officer may permit further replies by both parties.


<R05>
Sec. 18.7  Discovery.

    (a)(1) At any time after the initiation of the proceeding, the 
hearing officer may order, by subpoena if necessary, the taking of a 
deposition and the production of relevant documents by the deponent. 
Such order may be entered upon a showing that the deposition is 
necessary for discovery purposes, and that such discovery could not be 
accomplished by voluntary methods. Such an order may also be entered in 
extraordinary circumstances to preserve relevant evidence upon a showing 
that there is substantial reason to believe that such evidence could not 
be presented through a witness at the hearing. The decisive factors for 
a determination under this subsection, however, shall be fairness to all 
parties and the requirements of due process. Depositions may be taken 
orally or upon written questions before any person who has the power to 
administer oaths.
    (2) Each deponent shall be duly sworn, and any adverse party shall 
have the right to cross-examine. Objections to questions or documents 
shall be in short form, stating the grounds upon which objections are 
made. The

[[Page 407]]

objections made (but not including argument or debate), shall be reduced 
to writing and certified by the officer before whom the deposition was 
taken. Thereafter, the officer shall forward the deposition and one (1) 
copy thereof to the party at whose instance the deposition was taken and 
shall forward one (1) copy to the representative of the other party.
    (3) A deposition may be admitted into evidence as against any party 
who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition, or who 
had due notice thereof, if the hearing officer finds that there are 
sufficient reasons for admission and that the admission of the evidence 
would be fair to all parties and comport with the requirements of due 
process.
    (b)(1) At any time after the initiation of the appeal, any party may 
serve upon any other party written interrogatories to be answered by the 
party served, or by an authorized representative of the party if the 
party served is a corporate or governmental entity. The party served 
shall furnish all information which is available to it.
    (2) Each interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully in 
writing under oath by the party addressed or by an authorized 
representative. The time and manner of returning the interrogatory shall 
be prescribed by the hearing officer.


<R05>
Sec. 18.8  Recommended decision.

    Within a reasonable time after the close of the record of the 
hearings conducted under Sec. 18.6, the hearing officer shall submit 
findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a recommended order to the 
responsible agency official, in writing. The hearing officer shall 
promptly make copies of these documents available to the parties.


<R05>
Sec. 18.9  Final agency decision.

    (a) In hearings conducted under Sec. 18.6, the responsible agency 
official shall make the final agency decision, on the basis of the 
record, findings, conclusions, and recommendations presented by the 
hearing examiner.
    (b) Prior to making a final decision, the responsible agency 
official shall give the parties an opportunity to submit the following,

recommendations:
    (1) Proposed findings and determinations;
    (2) Exceptions to the recommendations of the hearing officer; and
    (3) Supporting reasons for the exceptions or proposed findings or 
determinations; and
    (4) Final briefs summarizing the arguments presented at the hearing.
    (c) All determinations, findings and conclusions made by the 
responsible agency official shall be final and conclusive upon the 
responsible agency and all appellants.


<R05>
Sec. 18.10  Rehearing.

    (a) Any appellant dissatisfied with a final agency decision under 
Sec. 18.9 may, within 30 days after the notice of the final agency 
decision is sent, request the responsible agency official to re-review 
the record, and present additional evidence which is appropriate and 
pertinent to support a different decision.
    (b) If the responsible agency official finds that the appellant has:
    (1) Presented evidence or argument which is sufficiently significant 
to require the conduct of further proceedings; or
    (2) Shown some defect in the conduct of the initial hearing 
sufficient to cause substantial unfairness or an erroneous finding in 
that hearing, the responsible agency official may require that another 
oral hearing be held on one or more of the issues in controversy, or 
permit the dissatisfied party to present further evidence or argument in 
writing.
    (c) Any rehearing ordered by the responsible agency official shall 
be conducted pursuant to Sec. Sec. 18.5-18.8.

    Authority: 39 U.S.C. 3220(a)(2), 5 U.S.C. 301.

    Source: Order No. 1239-87, 52 FR 45174, Nov. 25, 1987, unless 
otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 19.1  Purpose.

    This regulation, providing for a Missing Children Penalty Mail 
Program in the Department of Justice (DOJ), is intended to comply with 
the regulation requirement set forth in section 1(a) of Public Law 99-
87, which adds a new section 3220 to title 39, U.S. Code. The regulation 
also implements the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency 
Prevention (OJJDP) guideline (50 FR 46622) promulgated under the 
authority of 39 U.S.C. 3220(a)(1), and is intended to assist in the 
location and recovery of missing children through the use of DOJ penalty 
mail.


<R05>
Sec. 19.2  Contact person for Missing Children Penalty Mail Program.

    The DOJ contact person for the Missing Children Penalty Mail Program 
is: Patricia Schellman, General Services Staff, Justice Management 
Division, U.S. Department of Justice, 10th and Constitution Ave., NW., 
Washington, DC 20530, telephone number (202) 633-2353.


<R05>
Sec. 19.3  Policy.

    (a) The Department of Justice will supplement and expand the 
national effort to assist in the location and recovery of missing 
children by maximizing the economical use of missing children 
photographs and biographical information in domestic penalty mail 
directed to members of the public.
    (b) Because the use of inserts printed with missing children 
photographs and biographical information has been determined to be the 
most cost effective method for general application of the program, DOJ's 
first priority will be to insert, manually and via automated inserting 
equipment, photographs and biographical data related to missing children 
in a variety of types of penalty mail envelopes. These include:
    (1) Standard letter-size envelopes (4\1/2\<gr-thn-eq>x9\1/
2\<gr-thn-eq>);
    (2) Document-size envelopes (9\1/2\<gr-thn-eq>x12<gr-thn-eq>, 9\1/
2\x11\1/2\<gr-thn-eq>, 10<gr-thn-eq>x13<gr-thn-eq>); and
    (3) Other envelopes (misc. size).
    (c)(1) Maximum consideration will be given to the use of missing 
children materials with high volume printing plant or distribution plan 
mail that will be sent to the public or to Federal, State or local 
government agencies. Every effort will be made to use the most cost 
effective and efficient methods of obtaining, distributing, and 
disseminating missing children information.
    (2) In instances when the printing of photograph(s) and biographical 
information directly on self-mailers and other publications 
(newsletters, bulletins, etc.) and/or on penalty mail envelopes proves 
to be practical and cost effective, this method may also be used. 
Photographs and biographical information related to missing children may 
be printed on the three types of penalty mail envelopes listed above.
    (d) Missing children information shall not be placed on the 
``Penalty Indicia'', ``OCR Read Area'', ``Bar Code Read Area'', and 
``Return Address'' areas of standard letter-size envelopes per appendix 
A of the OJJDP guideline as published in the November 8, 1985, Federal 
Register (50 FR 46625).
    (e) The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (National 
Center) will be the sole source from which DOJ will acquire the camera-
ready and other photographic and biographical materials to be 
disseminated for use by DOJ organizational units. When printing missing 
children information, DOJ will select subjects in accordance with the 
schedule published by the National Center.
    (f) DOJ will remove all printed penalty mail envelopes and other 
materials from circulation or other use (i.e.: Use or destroy) within a 
three month period from the date the National Center receives 
information or notice that a child whose photograph and biographical 
information have been made available to DOJ has been recovered or that 
the parent(s) or guardian's permission to use the child's photograph and 
biographical information has been withdrawn. The National Center will be 
responsible for immediately notifying the DOJ contact person, in 
writing, of the need to withdraw penalty mail envelopes and other 
materials related to

[[Page 409]]

a particular child from circulation. Photographs which were reasonably 
current as of the time of the child's disappearance shall be the only 
acceptable form of visual media or pictorial likeness used on or in DOJ 
penalty mail.
    (g) DOJ will give priority to penalty mail that:
    (1) Is addressed to members of the public and will be received in 
the United States, its territories and possessions; and
    (2) Is widely disseminated and read by DOJ employees such as inter- 
and intra-agency publications and other media.
    (h) All DOJ employee suggestions, ideas or recommendations for 
innovative, cost-effective techniques for implementation of the Missing 
Children Penalty Mail Program should be forwarded to the DOJ contact 
person. DOJ Mail Managers shall hold biannual meetings to discuss the 
status of implementation of the current plan, and to consider 
recommendations to improve future plan implementation.
    (i) This shall be the sole DOJ regulation implementing this program.


<R05>
Sec. 19.4  Cost and percentage estimates.

    It is estimated that this program will cost DOJ $78,000 during the 
initial year. This figure is based on estimates of printing, inserting, 
and administrative costs. It is DOJ's objective that 50 percent of DOJ 
penalty mail contain missing children photographs and biographical 
information by the end of the first year of the program.


<R05>
Sec. 19.5  Report to the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.

    DOJ will compile and submit to OJJDP, by June 30, 1987, a 
consolidated report on its experience in implementation of 39 U.S.C. 
3220(a)(2), the OJJDP guidelines and the DOJ regulation. The report will 
consolidate information gathered from individual DOJ organizational 
units and cover the period February 5, 1986 through March 31, 1987. The 
report will provide the following information:
    (a) DOJ's experience in implementation, including problems 
encountered, successful and/or innovative methods adopted to use missing 
children photographs and information on or in penalty mail, the 
estimated number of pieces of penalty mail containing such information,

  Subpart B_State and Local Criminal History Record Information Systems

    Source: 41 FR 11715, Mar. 19, 1976, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 20.20  Applicability.

    (a) The regulations in this subpart apply to all State and local 
agencies and individuals collecting, storing, or disseminating criminal 
history record information processed by manual or automated operations 
where such collection, storage, or dissemination has been funded in 
whole or in part with funds made available by the Law Enforcement 
Assistance Administration subsequent to July 1, 1973, pursuant to title 
I of the Act. Use of information obtained from the FBI Identification 
Division or the FBI/NCIC system shall also be subject to limitations 
contained in subpart C.
    (b) The regulations in this subpart shall not apply to criminal 
history record information contained in:
    (1) Posters, announcements, or lists for identifying or apprehending 
fugitives or wanted persons;
    (2) Original records of entry such as police blotters maintained by

    (3) Court records of public judicial proceedings;
    (4) Published court or administrative opinions or public judicial, 
administrative or legislative proceedings;

[[Page 414]]

    (c) Nothing in these regulations prevents a criminal justice agency 
from disclosing to the public criminal history record information 
related to the offense for which an individual is currently within the 
criminal justice system. Nor is a criminal justice agency prohibited 
from confirming prior criminal history record information to members of 
the news media or any other person, upon specific inquiry as to whether 
a named individual was arrested, detained, indicted, or whether an 
information or other formal charge was filed, on a specified date, if 
the arrest record information or criminal record information disclosed 
is based on data excluded by paragraph (b) of this section. The 
regulations do not prohibit the dissemination of criminal history record 
information for purposes of international travel, such as issuing visas 
and granting of citizenship.


<R05>
Sec. 20.21  Preparation and submission of a Criminal History Record 

Information Plan.

    A plan shall be submitted to OJARS by each State on March 16, 1976, 
to set forth all operational procedures, except those portions relating 
to dissemination and security. A supplemental plan covering these 
portions shall be submitted no later than 90 days after promulgation of 
these amended regulations. The plan shall set forth operational 
procedures to--
    (a) Completeness and accuracy. Insure that criminal history record 
information is complete and accurate.
    (1) Complete records should be maintained at a central State 
repository. To be complete, a record maintained at a central State 
repository which contains information that an individual has been 
arrested, and which is available for dissemination, must contain 
information of any dispositions occurring within the State within 90 
days after the disposition has occurred. The above shall apply to all 
arrests occurring subsequent to the effective date of these regulations. 
Procedures shall be established for criminal justice agencies to query 
the central repository prior to dissemination of any criminal history 
record information unless it can be assured that the most up-to-date 
disposition data is being used. Inquiries of a central State repository 
shall be made prior to any dissemination except in those cases where 
time is of the essence and the repository is technically incapable of 
responding within the necessary time period.
    (2) To be accurate means that no record containing criminal history 
record information shall contain erroneous information. To accomplish 
this end, criminal justice agencies shall institute a process of data 
collection, entry, storage, and systematic audit that will minimize the 
possibility of recording and storing inaccurate information and upon 
finding inaccurate information of a material nature, shall notify all 
criminal justice agencies known to have received such information.
    (b) Limitations on dissemination. Insure that dissemination of 
nonconviction data has been limited, whether directly or through any 
intermediary only to:
    (1) Criminal justice agencies, for purposes of the administration of 
criminal justice and criminal justice agency employment;
    (2) Individuals and agencies for any purpose authorized by statute, 
ordinance, executive order, or court rule, decision, or order, as 
construed by appropriate State or local officials or agencies;
    (3) Individuals and agencies pursuant to a specific agreement with a 
criminal justice agency to provide services required for the 
administration of criminal justice pursuant to that agreement. The 
agreement shall specifically authorize access to data, limit the use of 
data to purposes for which given, insure the security and 
confidentiality of the data consistent with these regulations, and 
provide sanctions for violation thereof;
    (4) Individuals and agencies for the express purpose of research, 
evaluative, or statistical activities pursuant to an agreement with a 
criminal justice agency. The agreement shall specifically authorize 
access to data, limit the use of data to research, evaluative, or 
statistical purposes, insure the confidentiality and security of the 
data consistent with these regulations and with section 524(a) of the 
Act and any regulations implementing section

[[Page 415]]

524(a), and provide sanctions for the violation thereof. These 
dissemination limitations do not apply to conviction data.
    (c) General policies on use and dissemination. (1) Use of criminal 
history record information disseminated to noncriminal justice agencies 
shall be limited to the purpose for which it was given.
    (2) No agency or individual shall confirm the existence or 
nonexistence of criminal history record information to any person or 
agency that would not be eligible to receive the information itself.
    (3) Subsection (b) does not mandate dissemination of criminal 
history record information to any agency or individual. States and local 
governments will determine the purposes for which dissemination of 
criminal history record information is authorized by State law, 
executive order, local ordinance, court rule, decision or order.
    (d) Juvenile records. Insure that dissemination of records 
concerning proceedings relating to the adjudication of a juvenile as 
delinquent or in need or supervision (or the equivalent) to noncriminal 
justice agencies is prohibited, unless a statute, court order, rule or 
court decision specifically authorizes dissemination of juvenile 
records, except to the same extent as criminal history records may be 
disseminated as provided in paragraph (b) (3) and (4) of this section.
    (e) Audit. Insure that annual audits of a representative sample of 
State and local criminal justice agencies chosen on a random basis shall 
be conducted by the State to verify adherence to these regulations and 
that appropriate records shall be retained to facilitate such audits. 
Such records shall include, but are not limited to, the names of all 
persons or agencies to whom information is disseminated and the date 
upon which such information is disseminated. The reporting of a criminal 
justice transaction to a State, local or Federal repository is not a 
dissemination of information.
    (f) Security. Wherever criminal history record information is 
collected, stored, or disseminated, each State shall insure that the 
following requirements are satisfied by security standards established 
by State legislation, or in the absence of such legislation, by 
regulations approved or issued by the Governor of the State.
    (1) Where computerized data processing is employed, effective and 
technologically advanced software and hardware designs are instituted to 
prevent unauthorized access to such information.
    (2) Access to criminal history record information system facilities, 
systems operating environments, data file contents whether while in use 
or when stored in a media library, and system documentation is 
restricted to authorized organizations and personnel.
    (3)(i) Computer operations, whether dedicated or shared, which 
support criminal justice information systems, operate in accordance with 
procedures developed or approved by the participating criminal justice 
agencies that assure that:
    (a) Criminal history record information is stored by the computer in 
such manner that it cannot be modified, destroyed, accessed, changed, 
purged, or overlaid in any fashion by non-criminal justice terminals.
    (b) Operation programs are used that will prohibit inquiry, record 
updates, or destruction of records, from any terminal other than 
criminal justice system terminals which are so designated.
    (c) The destruction of records is limited to designated terminals 
under the direct control of the criminal justice agency responsible for 
creating or storing the criminal history record information.
    (d) Operational programs are used to detect and store for the output 
of designated criminal justice agency employees all unauthorized 
attempts to penetrate any criminal history record information system, 
program or file.
    (e) The programs specified in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) (b) and (d) of 
this section are known only to criminal justice agency employees 
responsible for criminal history record information system control or 
individuals and agencies pursuant to a specific agreement with the 
criminal justice agency to provide such programs and the program(s) are 
kept continuously under maximum security conditions.

[[Page 416]]

    (f) Procedures are instituted to assure that an individual or agency 
authorized direct access is responsible for (1) the physical security of 
criminal history record information under its control or in its custody 
and (2) the protection of such information from unauthorized access, 
disclosure or dissemination.
    (g) Procedures are instituted to protect any central repository of 
criminal history record information from unauthorized access, theft, 
sabotage, fire, flood, wind, or other natural or manmade disasters.
    (ii) A criminal justice agency shall have the right to audit, 
monitor and inspect procedures established above.
    (4) The criminal justice agency will:
    (i) Screen and have the right to reject for employment, based on 
good cause, all personnel to be authorized to have direct access to 
criminal history record information.
    (ii) Have the right to initiate or cause to be initiated 
administrative action leading to the transfer or removal of personnel 
authorized to have direct access to such information where such 
personnel violate the provisions of these regulations or other security 
requirements established for the collection, storage, or dissemination 
of criminal history record information.
    (iii) Institute procedures, where computer processing is not 
utilized, to assure that an individual or agency authorized direct 
access is responsible for
    (a) The physical security of criminal history record information 
under its control or in its custody and
    (b) The protection of such information from unauthorized access, 
disclosure, or dissemination.
    (iv) Institute procedures, where computer processing is not 
utilized, to protect any central repository of criminal history record 
information from unauthorized access, theft, sabotage, fire, flood, 
wind, or other natural or manmade disasters.
    (v) Provide that direct access to criminal history record 
information shall be available only to authorized officers or employees 
of a criminal justice agency and, as necessary, other authorized 
personnel essential to the proper operation of the criminal history 
record information system.
    (5) Each employee working with or having access to criminal history 
record information shall be made familiar with the substance and intent 
of these regulations.
    (g) Access and review. Insure the individual's right to access and 
review of criminal history information for purposes of accuracy and 
completeness by instituting procedures so that--
    (1) Any individual shall, upon satisfactory verification of his 
identity, be entitled to review without undue burden to either the 
criminal justice agency or the individual, any criminal history record 
information maintained about the individual and obtain a copy thereof 
when necessary for the purpose of challenge or correction;
    (2) Administrative review and necessary correction of any claim by 
the individual to whom the information relates that the information is

the data has been given;
    (5) The correcting agency shall notify all criminal justice 
recipients of corrected information; and

required procedures as set forth in Sec. 20.21 will be operational by 
March 1, 1978, a further extension of the deadline will be granted by 
OJARS upon a showing that the State has made a good faith effort to 
implement these regulations to the maximum extent feasible. 
Documentation justifying the request for the extension including a 
proposed timetable for full compliance must be submitted to OJARS by 
March 1, 1978. Where a State submits a request for an extension, the 
implementation date will be extended an additional 90 days while OJARS 
reviews the documentation for approval or disapproval. To be approved, 
such revised schedule must be consistent with the timetable and 
procedures set out below:
    (a) July 31, 1978--Submission of certificate of compliance with:
    (1) Individual access, challenge, and review requirements;
    (2) Administrative security;
    (3) Physical security to the maximum extent feasible.
    (b) Thirty days after the end of a State's next legislative 
session--Submission to OJARS of a description of State policy on 
dissemination of criminal history record information.
    (c) Six months after the end of a State's legislative session--
Submission to OJARS of a brief and concise description of standards and 
operating procedures to be followed by all criminal justice agencies 
covered by OJARS regulations in complying with the State policy on 
dissemination.
    (d) Eighteen months after the end of a State's legislative session--
Submission to OJARS of a certificate attesting to the conduct of an 
audit of the State central repository and of a random number of other 
criminal justice agencies in compliance with OJARS regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 20.37  Responsibility for accuracy, completeness, currency, and 

integrity.

    It shall be the responsibility of each criminal justice agency 
contributing data to the III System and the FIRS to assure that 
information on individuals is kept complete, accurate, and current so 
that all such records shall contain to the maximum extent feasible 
dispositions for all arrest data included therein. Dispositions should 
be submitted by criminal justice agencies within 120 days after the 
disposition has occurred.


<R05>
Sec. 20.38  Sanction for noncompliance.

    Access to systems managed or maintained by the FBI is subject to 
cancellation in regard to any agency or entity that fails to comply with 
the provisions of subpart C of this part.

Appendix to Part 20--Commentary on Selected Sections of the Regulations 
             on Criminal History Record Information Systems

    Subpart A-Sec. 20.3(d). The definition of criminal history record 
information is intended to include the basic offender-based transaction 
statistics/III System (OBTS/III) data elements. If notations of an 
arrest, disposition, or other formal criminal justice transaction occurs 
in records other than the traditional ``rap sheet,'' such as arrest 
reports, any criminal history record information contained in such 
reports comes under the definition of this subsection.
    The definition, however, does not extend to other information 
contained in criminal justice agency reports. Intelligence or 
investigative information (e.g., suspected criminal activity, 
associates, hangouts, financial information, and ownership of property 
and vehicles) is not included in the definition of criminal history 
information.
    Sec. 20.3(g). The definitions of criminal justice agency and 
administration of criminal justice in Sec. 20.3(b) of this part must be 
considered together. Included as criminal justice agencies would be 
traditional police, courts, and corrections agencies, as well as 
subunits of noncriminal justice agencies that perform the administration 
of criminal justice pursuant to a federal or state statute or executive 
order and allocate a substantial portion of their budgets to the 
administration of criminal justice. The above subunits of noncriminal 
justice agencies would include, for example, the Office of Investigation 
of the Food and Drug Administration, which has as its principal function 
the detection and apprehension of persons violating criminal provisions 
of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Also included under the 
definition of criminal justice agency are umbrella-type administrative 
agencies supplying criminal history information services, such as New 
York's Division of Criminal Justice Services.
    Sec. 20.3(i). Disposition is a key concept in section 524(b) of the 
Act and in Sec. Sec. 20.21(a)(1) and 20.21(b) of this part. It 
therefore is defined in some detail. The specific dispositions listed in 
this subsection are examples only and are not to be construed as 
excluding other, unspecified transactions concluding criminal 
proceedings within a particular agency.
    Sec. 20.3(q). The different kinds of acquittals and dismissals 
delineated in Sec. 20.3(i) are all considered examples of nonconviction 
data.
    Subpart B--Sec. 20.20(a). These regulations apply to criminal 
justice agencies receiving funds under the Omnibus Crime Control and 
Safe Streets Act for manual or automated systems subsequent to July 1, 
1973. In the hearings on the regulations, a number of those testifying 
challenged LEAA's authority to promulgate regulations for manual systems 
by contending that section 524(b) of the Act governs criminal history 
information contained in automated systems.
    The intent of section 524(b), however, would be subverted by only 
regulating automated systems. Any agency that wished to circumvent the 
regulations would be able to create duplicate manual files for purposes 
contrary to the letter and spirit of the regulations.
    Regulation of manual systems, therefore, is authorized by section 
524(b) when coupled with section 501 of the Act which authorizes the 
Administration to establish rules and regulations ``necessary to the 
exercise of its functions * * *.''
    The Act clearly applies to all criminal history record information 
collected, stored, or disseminated with LEAA support subsequent to July 
1, 1973.
    Limitations as contained in subpart C also apply to information 
obtained from the FBI Identification Division or the FBI/NCIC System.
    Sec. 20.20 (b) and (c). Section 20.20 (b) and (c) exempts from 
regulations certain types of records vital to the apprehension of 
fugitives, freedom of the press, and the public's right to know. Court 
records of public judicial proceedings are also exempt from the 
provisions of the regulations.
    Section 20.20(b)(2) attempts to deal with the problem of 
computerized police blotters. In some local jurisdictions, it is 
apparently possible for private individuals and/or newsmen upon 
submission of a specific name to obtain through a computer search of the 
blotter a history of a person's arrests. Such files create a partial 
criminal history data

[[Page 421]]

bank potentially damaging to individual privacy, especially since they 
do not contain final dispositions. By requiring that such records be 
accessed solely on a chronological basis, the regulations limit 
inquiries to specific time periods and discourage general fishing 
expeditions into a person's private life.
    Subsection 20.20(c) recognizes that announcements of ongoing 
developments in the criminal justice process should not be precluded 
from public disclosure. Thus, announcements of arrest, convictions, new 
developments in the course of an investigation may be made. It is also 
permissible for a criminal justice agency to confirm certain matters of 
public record information upon specific inquiry. Thus, if a question is 
raised: ``Was X arrested by your agency on January 3, 1975'' and this 
can be confirmed or denied by looking at one of the records enumerated 
in subsection (b) above, then the criminal justice agency may respond to 
the inquiry. Conviction data as stated in Sec. 20.21(b) may be 
disseminated without limitation.
    Sec. 20.21. The regulations deliberately refrain from specifying 
who within a State should be responsible for preparing the plan. This 
specific determination should be made by the Governor. The State has 90 
days from the publication of these revised regulations to submit the 
portion of the plan covering Sec. Sec. 20.21(b) and 20.21(f).
    Sec. 20.21(a)(1). Section 524(b) of the Act requires that LEAA 
insure criminal history information be current and that, to the maximum 
extent feasible, it contain disposition as well as current data.
    It is, however, economically and administratively impractical to 
maintain complete criminal histories at the local level. Arrangements 
for local police departments to keep track of dispositions by agencies 
outside of the local jurisdictions generally do not exist. It would, 
moreover, be bad public policy to encourage such arrangements since it 
would result in an expensive duplication of files.
    The alternatives to locally kept criminal histories are records 
maintained by a central State repository. A central State repository is 
a State agency having the function pursuant to a statute or executive 
order of maintaining comprehensive statewide criminal history record 
information files. Ultimately, through automatic data processing the 
State level will have the capability to handle all requests for in-State 
criminal history information.
    Section 20.20(a)(1) is written with a centralized State criminal 
history repository in mind. The first sentence of the subsection states 
that complete records should be retained at a central State repository. 
The word ``should'' is permissive; it suggests but does not mandate a 
central State repository.
    The regulations do require that States establish procedures for 
State and local criminal justice agencies to query central State 
repositories wherever they exist. Such procedures are intended to insure 
that the most current criminal justice information is used.
    As a minimum, criminal justice agencies subject to these regulations 
must make inquiries of central State repositories whenever the 
repository is capable of meeting the user's request within a reasonable 
time. Presently, comprehensive records of an individual's transactions 
within a State are maintained in manual files at the State level, if at 
all. It is probably unrealistic to expect manual systems to be able 
immediately to meet many rapid-access needs of police and prosecutors. 
On the other hand, queries of the State central repository for most 
noncriminal justice purposes probably can and should be made prior to 
dissemination of criminal history record information.
    Sec. 20.21(b). The limitations on dissemination in this subsection 
are essential to fulfill the mandate of section 524(b) of the Act which 
requires the Administration to assure that the ``privacy of all 
information is adequately provided for and that information shall only 
be used for law enforcement and criminal justice and other lawful 
purposes.'' The categories for dissemination established in this section 
reflect suggestions by hearing witnesses and respondents submitting 
written commentary.
    The regulations distinguish between conviction and nonconviction 
information insofar as dissemination is concerned. Conviction 
information is currently made available without limitation in many 
jurisdictions. Under these regulations, conviction data and pending 
charges could continue to be disseminated routinely. No statute, 
ordinance, executive order, or court rule is necessary in order to 
authorize dissemination of conviction data. However, nothing in the 
regulations shall be construed to negate a State law limiting such 
dissemination.
    After December 31, 1977, dissemination of nonconviction data would 
be allowed, if authorized by a statute, ordinance, executive order, or 
court rule, decision, or order. The December 31, 1977, deadline allows 
the States time to review and determine the kinds of dissemination for 
non-criminal justice purposes to be authorized. When a State enacts 
comprehensive legislation in this area, such legislation will govern 
dissemination by local jurisdictions within the State. It is possible 
for a public record law which has been construed by the State to 
authorize access to the public of all State records, including criminal 
history record information, to be considered as statutory authority 
under this subsection. Federal legislation and executive orders can also 
authorize dissemination and would be relevant authority.

[[Page 422]]

    For example, Civil Service suitability investigations are conducted 
under Executive Order 10450. This is the authority for most 
investigations conducted by the Commission. Section 3(a) of 10450 
prescribes the minimum scope of investigation and requires a check of 
FBI fingerprint files and written inquiries to appropriate law 
enforcement agencies.
    Sec. 20.21(b)(3). This subsection would permit private agencies 
such as the Vera Institute to receive criminal histories where they 
perform a necessary administration of justice function such as pretrial 
release. Private consulting firms which commonly assist criminal justice 
agencies in information systems development would also be included here.
    Sec. 20.21(b)(4). Under this subsection, any good faith researchers 
including private individuals would be permitted to use criminal history 
record information for research purposes. As with the agencies 
designated in Sec. 20.21(b)(3) researchers would be bound by an 
agreement with the disseminating criminal justice agency and would, of 
course, be subject to the sanctions of the Act.
    The drafters of the regulations expressly rejected a suggestion 
which would have limited access for research purposes to certified 
research organizations. Specifically ``certification'' criteria would 
have been extremely difficult to draft and would have inevitably led to 
unnecessary restrictions on legitimate research.
    Section 524(a) of the Act which forms part of the requirements of 
this section states:

    ``Except as provided by Federal law other than this title, no 
officer or employee of the Federal Government, nor any recipient of 
assistance under the provisions of this title shall use or reveal any 
research or statistical information furnished under this title by any 
person and identifiable to any specific private person for any purpose 
other than the purpose for which it was obtained in accordance with this 
title. Copies of such information shall be immune from legal process, 
and shall not, without the consent of the person furnishing such 
information, be admitted as evidence or used for any purpose in any 
action suit, or other judicial or administrative proceedings.''

LEAA anticipates issuing regulations, pursuant to section 524(a) as soon 
as possible.
    Sec. 20.21(c)(2). Presently some employers are circumventing State 
and local dissemination restrictions by requesting applicants to obtain 
an official certification of no criminal record. An employer's request 
under the above circumstances gives the applicant the unenviable choice 
of invasion of his privacy or loss of possible job opportunities. Under 
this subsection routine certifications of no record would no longer be 
permitted. In extraordinary circumstances, however, an individual could 
obtain a court order permitting such a certification.
    Sec. 20.21(c)(3). The language of this subsection leaves to the 
States the question of who among the agencies and individuals listed in 
Sec. 20.21(b) shall actually receive criminal records. Under these 
regulations a State could place a total ban on dissemination if it so 
wished. The State could, on the other hand, enact laws authorizing any 
member of the private sector to have access to non-conviction data.
    Sec. 20.21(d). Non-criminal justice agencies will not be able to 
receive records of juveniles unless the language of a statute or court 
order, rule, or court decision specifies that juvenile records shall be 
available for dissemination. Perhaps the most controversial part of this 
subsection is that it denies access to records of juveniles by Federal 
agencies conducting background investigations for eligibility to 
classified information under existing legal authority.
    Sec. 20.21(e) Since it would be too costly to audit each criminal 
justice agency in most States (Wisconsin, for example, has 1075 criminal 
justice agencies) random audits of a ``representative sample'' of 
agencies are the next best alternative. The term ``representative 
sample'' is used to insure that audits do not simply focus on certain 
types of agencies. Although this subsection requires that there be 
records kept with the names of all persons or agencies to whom 
information is disseminated, criminal justice agencies are not required 
to maintain dissemination logs for ``no record'' responses.
    Sec. 20.21(f). Requirements are set forth which the States must 
meet in order to assure that criminal history record information is 
adequately protected. Automated systems may operate in shared 
environments and the regulations require certain minimum assurances.
    Sec. 20.21(g)(1). A ``challenge'' under this section is an oral or 
written contention by an individual that his record is inaccurate or 
incomplete; it would require him to give a correct version of his record 
and explain why he believes his version to be correct. While an 
individual should have access to his record for review, a copy of the 
record should ordinarily only be given when it is clearly established 
that it is necessary for the purpose of challenge.
The drafters of the subsection expressly rejected a suggestion that 
would have called for a satisfactory verification of identity by 
fingerprint comparison. It was felt that States ought to be free to 
determine other means of identity verification.
    Sec. 20.21(g)(5). Not every agency will have done this in the past, 
but henceforth adequate records including those required under 20.21(e) 
must be kept so that notification can be made.

[[Page 423]]

    Sec. 20.21(g)(6). This section emphasizes that the right to access 
and review extends only to criminal history record information and does 
not include other information such as intelligence or treatment data.
    Sec. 20.22(a). The purpose for the certification requirement is to 
indicate the extent of compliance with these regulations. The term 
``maximum extent feasible'' acknowledges that there are some areas such 
as the completeness requirement which create complex legislative and 
financial problems.
    Note: In preparing the plans required by these regulations, States 
should look for guidance to the following documents: National Advisory 
Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, Report on the 
Criminal Justice System; Project SEARCH: Security and Privacy 
Considerations in Criminal History Information Systems, Technical 
Reports No. 2 and No. 13; Project SEARCH: A Model State Act for Criminal 
Offender Record Information, Technical Memorandum No. 3; and Project 
SEARCH: Model Administrative Regulations for Criminal Offender Record 
Information, Technical Memorandum No. 4.
    Subpart C-Sec. 20.31. This section defines the criminal history 
record information system managed by the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation. Each state having a record in the III System must have 
fingerprints on file in the FBI CJIS Division to support the III System 
record concerning the individual.
    Paragraph (b) is not intended to limit the identification services 
presently performed by the FBI for local, state, tribal, and federal 
agencies.
    Sec. 20.32. The grandfather clause contained in paragraph (c) of 
this section is designed, from a practical standpoint, to eliminate the 
necessity of deleting from the FBI's massive files the non-includable 
offenses that were stored prior to February, 1973. In the event a person 
is charged in court with a serious or significant offense arising out of 
an arrest involving a non-includable offense, the non-includable offense 
will also appear in the arrest segment of the III System record.
    Sec. 20.33(a)(3). This paragraph incorporates provisions cited in 
28 CFR 50.12 regarding dissemination of identification records outside 
the federal government for noncriminal justice purposes.
    Sec. 20.33(a)(6). Noncriminal justice governmental agencies are 
sometimes tasked to perform criminal justice dispatching functions or 
data processing/information services for criminal justice agencies as 
part, albeit not a principal part, of their responsibilities. Although 
such inter-governmental delegated tasks involve the administration of 
criminal justice, performance of those tasks does not convert an 
otherwise non-criminal justice agency to a criminal justice agency. This 
regulation authorizes this type of delegation if it is effected pursuant 
to executive order, statute, regulation, or interagency agreement. In 
this context, the noncriminal justice agency is servicing the criminal 
justice agency by performing an administration of criminal justice 
function and is permitted access to criminal history record information 
to accomplish that limited function. An example of such delegation would 
be the Pennsylvania Department of Administration's Bureau of 
Consolidated Computer Services, which performs data processing for 
several state agencies, including the Pennsylvania State Police. 
Privatization of the data processing/information services or dispatching 
function by the noncriminal justice governmental agency can be 
accomplished pursuant to Sec. 20.33(a)(7) of this part.
    Sec. 20.34. The procedures by which an individual may obtain a copy 
of his manual identification record are set forth in 28 CFR 16.30-16.34.
    The procedures by which an individual may obtain a copy of his III 
System record are as follows: If an individual has a criminal record 
supported by fingerprints and that record has been entered in the III 
System, it is available to that individual for review, upon presentation 
of appropriate identification, and in accordance with applicable state 
and federal administrative and statutory regulations. Appropriate 
identification includes being fingerprinted for the purpose of insuring 
that he is the individual that he purports to be. The record on file 
will then be verified as his through comparison of fingerprints.
    Procedure. 1. All requests for review must be made by the subject of 
the record through a law enforcement agency which has access to the III 
System. That agency within statutory or regulatory limits can require 
additional identification to assist in securing a positive 
identification.
    2. If the cooperating law enforcement agency can make an 
identification with fingerprints previously taken which are on file 
locally and if the FBI identification number of the individual's record 
is available to that agency, it can make an on-line inquiry through NCIC 
to obtain his III System record or, if it does not have suitable 
equipment to obtain an on-line response, obtain the record from 
Clarksburg, West Virginia, by mail. The individual will then be afforded 
the opportunity to see that record.
    3. Should the cooperating law enforcement agency not have the 
individual's fingerprints on file locally, it is necessary for that 
agency to relate his prints to an existing record by having his

Pacific Islands.
    (d) Pre-trial conference. A conference between the Government 
Attorney and a witness to discuss the witness' testimony. The conference

residence, but includes any place at which the witness is actually 
residing and at which the subpoena or summons is served. If the 
residence of the witness at the time of appearance is different from the 
place of subpoena or summons, the new place of residence shall be 
considered the witness' residence for computation of the transportation 
allowance; but, if the witness is on a business or vacation trip at the 
time of appearance, the witness shall be paid for travel from the place 
of service if this does not result in the witness being paid for more 
travel than is actually performed.
    (f) Summons. An official request, invitation or call, evidenced by 
an official writing of the court, authority, or party responsible for 
the conduct of the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 21.2  Employees of the United States serving as witnesses.

    (a) Applicability. This section applies to employees of the United 
States as defined by 5 U.S.C. 2105, except those whose pay is disbursed 
by the Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of the House of 
Representatives.
    (b) Entitlement to travel expenses--(1) Official capacity. An 
employee is entitled to travel expenses (in accordance with Sec. 
21.2(c)) in connection with any judicial or agency proceeding with 
respect to which the employee is summoned (and is authorized by the 
employee's agency to respond to such summons), or is assigned by his or 
her agency:
    (i) To testify or produce official records on behalf of the United 
States, or
    (ii) To testify in his or her official capacity or produce official 
records on behalf of a party other than the United States.


The witness appropriation of the Department of Justice is not available 
for

[[Page 425]]

expenses incurred under these conditions.
    (2) Unofficial capacity, federal involvement. An employee is 
entitled to travel expenses (in accordance with paragraph (c) of this 
section) in connection with any judicial or agency proceeding with 
respect to which the employee is summoned to testify on behalf of the 
United States. If an employee is summoned to testify on behalf of a 
party other than the United States, the employee's travel expenses shall 
be payable by the court, authority, or party which caused the employee 
to be summoned.
    (3) Unofficial capacity, no Federal involvement. An employee who 
appears as a witness in any judicial proceeding in an unofficial 
capacity in which there is no Federal involvement is not authorized 
Government travel expenses and may retain reimbursement for expenses 
which he or she receives from the court, authority or party which caused 
the employee to be summoned.
    (c) Allowable travel expenses. An employee qualifying for payment of 
travel expenses by virtue of being called in an official capacity or on 
behalf of the United States shall be paid at rates and in amounts 
allowable for other purposes under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5702-5705 
and applicable regulations prescribed thereunder by the Administrator, 
General Services, and the employing agency. Such payment shall be 
reduced to the extent that the travel expenses are paid to the employee 
for his or her appearance by the court, authority, or party which caused 
the employee to be summoned as a witness in an official capacity on 
behalf of a party other than the United States.
    (d) Payment and reimbursement--(1) Payable by the employing agency. 
If an employee serves as a witness, and the case involves the activity 
in connection with which he or she is employed, the travel expenses are 
payable from the appropriation of the employing agency. The Comptroller 
General has defined the extent to which the case must be related to the 
agency's activity as a condition to the agency's responsibility for 
payment in 23 Comp. Gen. 47, 49 (1943), which states ``the employing 
agency is required to pay . . . the traveling expenses incurred by the 
witness only where the information or facts ascertained by the employee 
as part of his official duties forms the basis of the case, or where the 
proceeding is predicated upon a law that that agency is required to 
administer.'' In 39 Comp. Gen. 1, 2 (1959), the Comptroller General 
determined that if an employee testifies regarding facts and information 
he or she acquires in the course of his or her assigned duties, the 
employing agency is responsible for the payment of the employee's travel 
expenses. In these instances, the witness appropriation of the 
Department of Justice is not available for payment of expenses.
    (2) Payable by the Department of Justice. If an employee appears on 
behalf of the United States in an unofficial capacity in a judicial 
proceeding involving the Department of Justice, the employee's travel 
expenses are payable by the Department of Justice. The employing agency 
may advance or pay the travel expenses of the employee and later obtain 
reimbursement from the Department of Justice by submitting an 
appropriate bill together with a copy of the approved advance or travel 
voucher.
    (e) Leave and attendance fee--(1) Leave. An employee is considered 
to be in official duty status when appearing as a witness in his or her 
official capacity or on behalf of the United States in an unofficial 
capacity. An employee is entitled to court leave when he or she appears 
as a witness in an unofficial capacity not on behalf of the United 
States, and the United States, the District of Columbia, or a State or 
local government is a party to the case. An employee must use annual 
leave or leave without pay to appear as a witness when the United 
States, the District of Columbia, or a State or local government is not 
a party.
    (2) Attendance fee. An employee who appears on behalf of the United 
States is not entitled to receive an attendance fee. An employee who 
appears on behalf of a party other than the United States while in 
official duty status or while on court leave should request an 
attendance fee from the court, authority, or party which caused the 
employee to be summoned. Such fee shall be remitted to the employing 
agency. An employee

[[Page 426]]

who must use annual leave or leave without pay to appear as a witness 
may retain an attendance fee which he or she receives.


<R05>
Sec. 21.3  Aliens.

    (a) Aliens entitled to payment of $30 per day. The following aliens 
are entitled to witness fees and allowances provided in Sec. 21.4:
    (1) Aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence (documentary 
evidence: Form I-151 or Form 1-551, Alien Registration Receipt Card);
    (2) Aliens lawfully admitted in one of the nonimmigrant categories 
described in 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15) (documentary evidence: unexpired Form 
1-94, Arrival-Departure Record). But see below Sec. 21.3(b);
    (3) Aliens admitted as refugees under 8 U.S.C. 1157 and aliens 
granted asylum under 8 U.S.C. 1158 (documentary evidence: Form I-94, 
Arrival Departure Record, indicating admission as refugee under 8 U.S.C. 
1157 or granting asylum under 8 U.S.C. 1158, employment authorized);
    (4) Aliens who have rendered themselves amenable to deportation 
proceedings, but have not admitted deportability or have not been 
determined to be deportable pursuant to section 242 of the Immigration 
and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1252).
    (b) Aliens entitled to payment of $1 per day. An alien who is 
``excludable'' in accordance with 8 U.S.C. 1226, but whose removal is 
stayed by the Attorney General (in accordance with 8 U.S.C. 1227(d)) 
because:
    (1) The testimony of the alien is necessary on behalf of the United 
States in the prosecution of offenders against the United States, or
    (2) The testimony of the alien is necessary on behalf of an indigent 
criminal defendant in accordance with Rule 17(b) of the Federal Rules of 
Criminal Procedures,

is entitled to a $1 per day witness fee. No other fees and allowances 
are authorized.
    (c) Aliens not entitled to payment. An alien who has been paroled 
into the United States for prosecution pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5) 
(documentary evidence: Form I-94, Arrival-Departure Record, Parole 
Edition), or an alien who has admitted belonging to a class of aliens 
who are deportable, or an alien who has been determined pursuant to 8 
U.S.C. 1252(b) to be deportable (documentary evidence: decision by a 
Special Inquiry Officer, Board of Immigration Appeals, or court), is 
prohibited from receiving fees and allowances in accordance with 28 
U.S.C. 1821(e).
    (d) Doubtful cases. If the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
advises that the alien has admitted deportability, or that he or she was 
paroled into the United States for prosecution, or that deportation 
proceedings have been completed against the alien with a result 
favorable to the Government, no payment under 28 U.S.C. 1821 may be 
made.


<R05>
Sec. 21.4  Fees and allowances of fact witnesses.

    The fees and allowances of fact witnesses, other than those covered 
by Sec. 21.2, attending at any judicial proceeding, shall be a follows:
    (a) Fee. A witness shall be paid an attendance fee of $30 per day 
for each day's attendance. A witness shall also be paid the attendance 
fee for the time necessarily occupied in going to and returning from the 
place of attendance. However, if both attendance and travel occur on the 
same day, a witness is entitled to only one fee.
    (b) Allowable transportation expenses. A witness shall be entitled 
to transportation expenses based on the means of transportation 
reasonably utilized (based on the nature, duration, location and 
distance of travel) and the distance necessarily traveled from and to 
such witness' residence by the shortest practical route and the fastest 
means of transportation available in going to and returning from the 
place of attendance. Additional costs incurred (including attendance 
fees and subsistence allowances) because of a slower means of 
transportation must be justified for consideration.
    (1) A witness who travels by regularly scheduled common carrier 
shall be paid for the actual expenses of transportation at the most 
economical rate reasonably available. A receipt or other evidence of 
actual cost shall be furnished.

[[Page 427]]

    (2) A witness who travels by privately owned vehicle shall be paid a 
transportation allowance equal to the mileage allowance paid for 
official travel of employees of the Federal Government under the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5704. However, when two or more witnesses travel 
in the same privately owned vehicle, only the witness incurring the 
expense shall receive the mileage allowance.
    (3) A witness incurring incidental transportation expenses, such as 
taxi fares between the place of attendance, residence or lodging and the 
carrier terminals; bridge, road and tunnel tolls; ferry fares; and 
parking fees shall be paid in full for such expenses. Receipts or other 
evidence of actual payment are required for all parking fees (if 
available) and all other single items costing more than $25.
    (4) First-class travel by witnesses requires the same justification 
and approval required for first-class travel by employees of the Federal 
Government.
    (c) Subsistence allowance. A witness (other than a witness detained 
in custody) who is required to be away from his or her residence 
overnight is entitled to a subsistence allowance. A witness who is not 
required to be away from his or her residence overnight is not entitled 
to a subsistence allowance. The witness' subsistence allowance shall not 
exceed either the per diem rate or the actual subsistence allowance rate 
prescribed for Government employees for the place of attendance. These 
rates are established by the Administrator, General Services, for areas 
within the conterminous United States; the Secretary of Defense for 
areas of the United States other than conterminous; or the Secretary of 
State as published in the Standardized Regulations (Government 
Civilians, Foreign Areas) for foreign areas. The witness' subsistence 
allowance shall consist of a meal and miscellaneous expense portion and 
a lodging portion. When an overnight stay is required, the witness shall 
be entitled to:
    (1) The meal and miscellaneous expense portion for each day (or 
partial day) the witness is required to remain away from his or her 
residence and
    (2) The lodging portion for each night the witness is required to 
incur a lodging expense.

The meal and miscellaneous expense portion shall be 50% of the 
authorized subsistence allowance rate rounded to the next whole dollar 
in an actual subsistence rate area, or 45% of the per diem rate rounded 
to the next whole dollar in a per diem area. The lodging portion shall 
be the difference between the meal and miscellaneous expense portion and 
the authorized rate.
    (d) Detained witness fee. A witness (other than an alien covered by 
Sec. 21.3) detained in custody pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3149 for want of 
security for his or her appearance shall receive subsistence in kind and 
shall be paid a single daily attendance fee for each day the witness is 
detained. A witness in custody for purposes other than 18 U.S.C. 3149 is 
ineligible to receive the attendance and subsistence fees provided by 
this section.


<R05>
Sec. 21.5  Use of table of distances.

    Mileage payable to witnesses under 28 U.S.C. 1821 shall be computed 
on the basis of odometer readings or the highway distances as stated in 
the Rand McNally Standard Highway Mileage Guide or in any generally 
accepted highway mileage guide which contains a shortline nationwide 
table of distances. However, with respect to travel in areas for which 
no such highway mileage guide exists, mileage payable under 28 U.S.C. 
1821 shall be based on the lesser of either (a) the route of travel 
actually employed or (b) a usually traveled route.


<R05>
Sec. 21.6  Proceedings in forma pauperis.

    Title 28 U.S.C. 1915 provides for the commencement, prosecution or 
defense of any suit, action, or proceeding without prepayment of fees 
and costs. Witnesses shall attend as in other cases.
    (a) Civil cases. There are currently no provisions for payment of 
witnesses called by the indigent. If the indigent party prevails, 
witness fees and expenses may be taxed as costs in accordance with 28 
U.S.C. 1920.
    (b) Criminal cases. Rule 17(b), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 
requires that fact witnesses subpoenaed on behalf of an indigent 
defendant be paid in

[[Page 428]]

the same manner as witnesses called on behalf of the Government. The 
attendance must be certified by the presiding officer of the court. The 
expenses of Federal Government employees are treated in the same manner 
as they are treated when the employee is called by a Government 
attorney.


<R05>
Sec. 21.7  Certification of witness attendance.

    In any case in which the U.S. Department of Justice, or office or 
organization thereof, is a party, the Department of Justice shall pay 
all fees and allowances of witnesses, except for those witnesses as 
defined in Sec. 21.2, paragraph (d)(1), on the certification of the 
following officials: The U.S. Attorney, an Assistant U.S. Attorney, a 
U.S. Trustee, or the U.S. Department of Justice attorney who actually 
conducts the case. In criminal proceedings in forma pauperis or in 
proceedings before a U.S. Commissioner, U.S. Magistrate or U.S. Parole 
Commission Hearing Examiner, the Department of Justice shall pay all 
fees and allowances of witnesses on the certification of the U.S. 
District Judge hearing the case or such Commissioner, Magistrate, or 
Hearing Examiner.

Sec.
23.1 Purpose.
23.2 Background.
23.3 Applicability.
23.20 Operating principles.
23.30 Funding guidelines.
23.40 Monitoring and auditing of grants for the funding of intelligence

    Source: 58 FR 48452, Sept. 16, 1993, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 23.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this regulation is to assure that all criminal 
intelligence systems operating through support under the Omnibus Crime 
Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 3711, et seq., as 
amended (Pub. L. 90-351, as amended by Pub. L. 91-644, Pub. L. 93-83, 
Pub. L. 93-415, Pub. L. 94-430, Pub. L. 94-503, Pub. L. 95-115, Pub. L. 
96-157, Pub. L. 98-473, Pub. L. 99-570, Pub. L. 100-690, and Pub. L. 
101-647), are utilized in conformance with the privacy and 
constitutional rights of individuals.


<R05>
Sec. 23.2  Background.

    It is recognized that certain criminal activities including but not 
limited to loan sharking, drug trafficking, trafficking in stolen 
property, gambling, extortion, smuggling, bribery, and corruption of 
public officials often involve some degree of regular coordination and 
permanent organization involving a large number of participants over a 
broad geographical area. The exposure of such ongoing networks of 
criminal activity can be aided by the pooling of information about such 
activities. However, because the collection and exchange of intelligence 
data necessary to support control of serious criminal activity may 
represent potential threats to the privacy of individuals to whom such 
data relates, policy guidelines for Federally funded projects are 
required.


<R05>
Sec. 23.3  Applicability.

    (a) These policy standards are applicable to all criminal 
intelligence systems operating through support under

[[Page 433]]

the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 3711, 
et seq., as amended (Pub. L. 90-351, as amended by Pub. L. 91-644, Pub. 
L. 93-83, Pub. L. 93-415, Pub. L. 94-430, Pub. L. 94-503, Pub. L. 95-
115, Pub. L. 96-157, Pub. L. 98-473, Pub. L. 99-570, Pub. L. 100-690, 
and Pub. L. 101-647).
    (b) As used in these policies:
    (1) Criminal Intelligence System or Intelligence System means the 
arrangements, equipment, facilities, and procedures used for the 
receipt, storage, interagency exchange or dissemination, and analysis of 
criminal intelligence information;
    (2) Interjurisdictional Intelligence System means an intelligence 
system which involves two or more participating agencies representing 
different governmental units or jurisdictions;
    (3) Criminal Intelligence Information means data which has been 
evaluated to determine that it:
    (i) Is relevant to the identification of and the criminal activity 
engaged in by an individual who or organization which is reasonably 
suspected of involvement in criminal activity, and
    (ii) Meets criminal intelligence system submission criteria;
    (4) Participating Agency means an agency of local, county, State, 
Federal, or other governmental unit which exercises law enforcement or 
criminal investigation authority and which is authorized to submit and 
receive criminal intelligence information through an interjurisdictional 
intelligence system. A participating agency may be a member or a 
nonmember of an interjurisdictional intelligence system;
    (5) Intelligence Project or Project means the organizational unit 
which operates an intelligence system on behalf of and for the benefit 
of a single agency or the organization which operates an 
interjurisdictional intelligence system on behalf of a group of 
participating agencies; and
    (6) Validation of Information means the procedures governing the 
periodic review of criminal intelligence information to assure its 
continuing compliance with system submission criteria established by 
regulation or program policy.


<R05>
Sec. 23.20  Operating principles.

    (a) A project shall collect and maintain criminal intelligence 
information concerning an individual only if there is reasonable 
suspicion that the individual is involved in criminal conduct or 
activity and the information is relevant to that criminal conduct or 
activity.
    (b) A project shall not collect or maintain criminal intelligence 
information about the political, religious or social views, 
associations, or activities of any individual or any group, association, 
corporation, business, partnership, or other organization unless such 
information directly relates to criminal conduct or activity and there 
is reasonable suspicion that the subject of the information is or may be 
involved in criminal conduct or activity.
    (c) Reasonable Suspicion or Criminal Predicate is established when 
information exists which establishes sufficient facts to give a trained 
law enforcement or criminal investigative agency officer, investigator, 
or employee a basis to believe that there is a reasonable possibility 
that an individual or organization is involved in a definable criminal 
activity or enterprise. In an interjurisdictional intelligence system, 
the project is responsible for establishing the existence of reasonable 
suspicion of criminal activity either through examination of supporting 
information submitted by a participating agency or by delegation of this 
responsibility to a properly trained participating agency which is 
subject to routine inspection and audit procedures established by the 
project.
    (d) A project shall not include in any criminal intelligence system 
information which has been obtained in violation of any applicable 
Federal, State, or local law or ordinance. In an interjurisdictional 
intelligence system, the project is responsible for establishing that no 
information is entered in violation of Federal, State, or local laws, 
either through examination of supporting information submitted by a 
participating agency or by delegation of this responsibility to a 
properly trained participating agency which is subject to routine 
inspection and audit procedures established by the project.

[[Page 434]]

    (e) A project or authorized recipient shall disseminate criminal 
intelligence information only where there is a need to know and a right 
to know the information in the performance of a law enforcement 
activity.
    (f)(1) Except as noted in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, a 
project shall disseminate criminal intelligence information only to law 
enforcement authorities who shall agree to follow procedures regarding 
information receipt, maintenance, security, and dissemination which are 
consistent with these principles.
    (2) Paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall not limit the 
dissemination of an assessment of criminal intelligence information to a 
government official or to any other individual, when necessary, to avoid 
imminent danger to life or property.
    (g) A project maintaining criminal intelligence information shall 
ensure that administrative, technical, and physical safeguards 
(including audit trails) are adopted to insure against unauthorized 
access and against intentional or unintentional damage. A record 
indicating who has been given information, the reason for release of the 
information, and the date of each dissemination outside the project 
shall be kept. Information shall be labeled to indicate levels of 
sensitivity, levels of confidence, and the identity of submitting 
agencies and control officials. Each project must establish written 
definitions for the need to know and right to know standards for 
dissemination to other agencies as provided in paragraph (e) of this 
section. The project is responsible for establishing the existence of an 
inquirer's need to know and right to know the information being 
requested either through inquiry or by delegation of this responsibility 
to a properly trained participating agency which is subject to routine 
inspection and audit procedures established by the project. Each 
intelligence project shall assure that the following security 
requirements are implemented:
    (1) Where appropriate, projects must adopt effective and 
technologically advanced computer software and hardware designs to 
prevent unauthorized access to the information contained in the system;
    (2) The project must restrict access to its facilities, operating 
environment and documentation to organizations and personnel authorized 
by the project;
    (3) The project must store information in the system in a manner 
such that it cannot be modified, destroyed, accessed, or purged without 
authorization;
    (4) The project must institute procedures to protect criminal 
intelligence information from unauthorized access, theft, sabotage, 
fire, flood, or other natural or manmade disaster;
    (5) The project must promulgate rules and regulations based on good 
cause for implementing its authority to screen, reject for employment, 
transfer, or remove personnel authorized to have direct access to the 
system; and
    (6) A project may authorize and utilize remote (off-premises) system 
data bases to the extent that they comply with these security 
requirements.
    (h) All projects shall adopt procedures to assure that all 
information which is retained by a project has relevancy and importance. 
Such procedures shall provide for the periodic review of information and 
the destruction of any information which is misleading, obsolete or 
otherwise unreliable and shall require that any recipient agencies be 
advised of such changes which involve errors or corrections. All 
information retained as a result of this review must reflect the name of 
the reviewer, date of review and explanation of decision to retain. 
Information retained in the system must be reviewed and validated for 
continuing compliance with system submission criteria before the 
expiration of its retention period, which in no event shall be longer 
than five (5) years.
    (i) If funds awarded under the Act are used to support the operation 
of an intelligence system, then:
    (1) No project shall make direct remote terminal access to 
intelligence information available to system participants, except as 
specifically approved by the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) based on a 
determination that the system has adequate policies

[[Page 435]]

and procedures in place to insure that it is accessible only to 
authorized systems users; and
    (2) A project shall undertake no major modifications to system 
design without prior grantor agency approval.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (j) A project shall notify the grantor agency prior to initiation of 
formal information exchange procedures with any Federal, State, 
regional, or other information systems not indicated in the grant 
documents as initially approved at time of award.
    (k) A project shall make assurances that there will be no purchase 
or use in the course of the project of any electronic, mechanical, or 
other device for surveillance purposes that is in violation of the 
provisions of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, Public 
Law 99-508, 18 U.S.C. 2510-2520, 2701-2709 and 3121-3125, or any 
applicable State statute related to wiretapping and surveillance.
    (l) A project shall make assurances that there will be no harassment 
or interference with any lawful political activities as part of the 
intelligence operation.
    (m) A project shall adopt sanctions for unauthorized access, 
utilization, or disclosure of information contained in the system.
    (n) A participating agency of an interjurisdictional intelligence 
system must maintain in its agency files information which documents 
each submission to the system and supports compliance with project entry 
criteria. Participating agency files supporting system submissions must 
be made available for reasonable audit and inspection by project 
representatives. Project representatives will conduct participating 
agency inspection and audit in such a manner so as to protect the 
confidentiality and sensitivity of participating agency intelligence 
records.
    (o) The Attorney General or designee may waive, in whole or in part, 
the applicability of a particular requirement or requirements contained 
in this part with respect to a criminal intelligence system, or for a 
class of submitters or users of such system, upon a clear and convincing 
showing that such waiver would enhance the collection, maintenance or 
dissemination of information in the criminal intelligence system, while 
ensuring that such system would not be utilized in violation of the 
privacy and constitutional rights of individuals or any applicable state 
or federal law.


<R05>
Sec. 23.30  Funding guidelines.

    The following funding guidelines shall apply to all Crime Control 
Act funded discretionary assistance awards and Bureau of Justice 
Assistance (BJA) formula grant program subgrants, a purpose of which is 
to support the operation of an intelligence system. Intelligence systems 
shall only be funded where a grantee/subgrantee agrees to adhere to the 
principles set forth above and the project meets the following criteria:
    (a) The proposed collection and exchange of criminal intelligence 
information has been coordinated with and will support ongoing or 
proposed investigatory or prosecutorial activities relating to specific 
areas of criminal activity.
    (b) The areas of criminal activity for which intelligence 
information is to be utilized represent a significant and recognized 
threat to the population and:
    (1) Are either undertaken for the purpose of seeking illegal power 
or profits or pose a threat to the life and property of citizens; and
    (2) Involve a significant degree of permanent criminal organization; 
or
    (3) Are not limited to one jurisdiction.
    (c) The head of a government agency or an individual with general 
policy making authority who has been expressly delegated such control 
and supervision by the head of the agency will retain control and 
supervision of information collection and dissemination for the criminal 
intelligence system. This official shall certify in writing that he or 
she takes full responsibility and will be accountable for the 
information maintained by and disseminated from the system and that the 
operation of the system will be in compliance with the principles set 
forth in Sec. 23.20.
    (d)(1) Where the system is an interjurisdictional criminal 
intelligence system, the governmental agency

[[Page 436]]

which exercises control and supervision over the operation of the system 
shall require that the head of that agency or an individual with general 
policymaking authority who has been expressly delegated such control and 
supervision by the head of the agency:
    (i) Assume official responsibility and accountability for actions 
taken in the name of the joint entity, and
    (ii) Certify in writing that the official takes full responsibility 
and will be accountable for insuring that the information transmitted to 
the interjurisdictional system or to participating agencies will be in 
compliance with the principles set forth in Sec. 23.20.

private

[[Page 438]]

organization with a net worth of not more than $5 million and not more 
than 500 employees.
    (c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of 
employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the 
adversary adjudication was initiated.


<R05>
Sec. 24.106  Standards for awards.

    (a) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and 
expenses incurred in connection with a proceeding unless (1) the 
position of the Department as a party to the proceeding was 
substantially justified or (2) special circumstances make the award 
sought unjust. No presumption arises that the agency's position was not 
substantially justified simply because the agency did not prevail.
    (b) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly 
or unreasonably protracted the proceedings.


<R05>
Sec. 24.107  Allowable fees and other expenses.

    (a) The following fees and other expenses are allowable under the 
Act:
    (1) Reasonable expenses of expert witnesses;
    (2) Reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, 
test, or project which the Department finds necessary for the 
preparation of the party's case;
    (3) Reasonable attorney or agent fees;
    (b) The amount of fees awarded will be based upon the prevailing 
market rates for the kind and quality of services furnished, except that
    (1) Compensation for an expert witness will not exceed the highest 
rate paid by the Department for expert witnesses; and
    (2) Attorney or agent fees will not be in excess of $75 per hour.

identify the position of the Department in the proceeding that the 
applicant alleges was not substantially justified.
    (b) The application shall include a statement that the applicant's 
net worth as of the time the proceeding was initiated did not exceed $1 
million if the applicant is an individual (other than a sole owner of an 
unincorporated business seeking an award in that capacity) or $5 million 
in the case of all other applicants. An applicant may omit this 
statement if:
    (1) It attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service 
that it qualifies as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) and is exempt 
from taxation under section 501(a) of the Code or, in the case of such 
an organization not required to obtain a ruling from the Internal 
Revenue Service on its exempt status, a statement that describes the 
basis for the applicant's belief that it qualifies under section 
501(c)(3) of the Code; or
    (2) It states that it is a cooperative association as defined in 
section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)).
    (c) If the applicant is a partnership, corporation, association, or 
organization, or a sole owner of an unincorporated business, the 
application shall state that it did not have more than 500 employees at 
the time the proceeding was initiated, giving the number of its 
employees and describing briefly the type and purpose of its 
organization or business.
    (d) The application shall itemize the amount of fees and expenses 
for which an award is sought.
    (e) The application may include any other matters that the applicant 
believes should be considered in determining whether and in what amount 
an award should be made.
    (f) The application shall be signed by the applicant with respect to 
the eligibility of the applicant and by the attorney of the applicant 
with respect to fees and expenses sought. The application shall contain 
or be accompanied by a written verification under oath or affirmation 
under penalty of perjury that the information provided in the 
application and all accompanying material is true and complete to the 
best of the signer's information and belief.

[[Page 439]]


<R05>
Sec. 24.202  Net worth exhibit.

    (a) Each applicant except a qualified tax exempt organization or a 
qualified cooperative must submit with its application a detailed 
exhibit showing its net worth at the time the proceeding was initiated. 
If any individual, corporation, or other entity directly or indirectly 
controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of 
the applicant, or if the applicant directly or indirectly owns or 
controls a majority of the voting shares of other interest of any 
corporation or other entity, the exhibit must include a showing of the 
net worth of all such affiliates or of the applicant including the 
affiliates. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant, 
provided that it makes full disclosure of the applicant's and any 
affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine 
whether the applicant qualifies under the standards of 5 U.S.C. 
504(b)(1)(B)(i). The adjudicative officer may require an applicant to 
file additional information to determine the applicant's eligibility for 
an award.
    (b) The net worth exhibit shall describe any transfers of assets 
from, or obligations incurred by, the applicant or any affiliate, 
occurring in the one-year period prior to the date on which the 
proceeding was initiated, that reduced the net worth of the applicant 
and its affiliates below the applicable net worth ceiling. If there were 
no such transactions, the applicant shall so state.
    (c) The net worth exhibit shall be included in the public record of 
the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 24.203  Documentation of fees and expenses.

    (a) The application shall be accompanied by full documentation of 
the fees and expenses, including the cost of any study, engineering 
report, test, or project, for which an award is sought.
    (b) The documentation shall include an affidavit from any attorney, 
agent, or expert witness representing or appearing in behalf of the 
party, stating the actual time expended and the rate at which fees and 
other expenses were computed and describing the specific services 
performed.
    (1) The affidavit shall state the services performed. In order to 
establish the hourly rate, the affidavit shall state the hourly rate 
which is billed and paid by the majority of clients during the relevant 
time periods.
    (2) If no hourly rate is paid by the majority of clients because, 
for instance, the attorney or agent represents most clients on a 
contingency basis, the attorney or agent shall provide information about 
two attorneys or agents with similar experience, who perform similar 
work, stating their hourly rate.
    (c) The documentation shall also include a description of any 
expenses for which reimbursement is sought and a statement of the 
amounts paid and payable by the applicant or by any other person or 
entity for the services provided.
    (d) The adjudicative officer may require the applicant to provide 
vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation for any expenses claimed.


<R05>
Sec. 24.204  Time for submission of application.

    (a) An application must be filed no later than 30 days after final 
disposition of the proceeding. If review or reconsideration is sought or 
taken of a decision as to which an applicant believes it has prevailed, 
action on the award of fees shall be stayed pending final disposition of 
the underlying controversy.
    (b) Final disposition means the later of:
    (1) The date on which the final agency decision is issued,
    (2) The date on which a petition for rehearing or reconsideration is 
disposed of, or
    (3) The date of final resolution of the proceeding, such as 
settlement or voluntary dismissal, which is not subject to a petition 
for rehearing or reconsideration.

<R04>
     Subpart A_The National Instant Criminal Background Check System


<R05>
Sec. 25.1  Purpose and authority.

    The purpose of this subpart is to establish policies and procedures 
implementing the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (Brady Act), 
Public Law 103-159, 107 Stat. 1536. The Brady Act requires the Attorney 
General to establish a National Instant Criminal Background Check System 
(NICS) to be contacted by any licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, 
or licensed dealer of firearms for information as to whether the 
transfer of a firearm to any person who is not licensed under 18 U.S.C. 
923 would be in violation of Federal or state law. The regulations in 
this subpart are issued pursuant to section 103(h) of the Brady Act, 107 
Stat. 1542 (18 U.S.C. 922 note), and include requirements to ensure the 
privacy and security of the NICS and appeals procedures for persons who 
have been denied the right to obtain a firearm as a result of a NICS 
background check performed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) 
or a state or local law enforcement agency.


<R05>
Sec. 25.2  Definitions.

    Appeal means a formal procedure to challenge the denial of a firearm 
transfer.
    ARI means a unique Agency Record Identifier assigned by the agency 
submitting records for inclusion in the NICS Index.
    ATF means the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms of the 
Department of Treasury.
    Audit log means a chronological record of system (computer) 
activities that enables the reconstruction and examination of the 
sequence of events and/or changes in an event.
    Business day means a 24-hour day (beginning at 12:01 a.m.) on which 
state offices are open in the state in which the proposed firearm 
transaction is to take place.
    Control Terminal Agency means a state or territorial criminal 
justice agency recognized by the FBI as the agency responsible for 
providing state-or territory-wide service to criminal justice users of 
NCIC data.

[[Page 442]]

    Data source means an agency that provided specific information to 
the NICS.
    Delayed means the response given to the FFL indicating that the 
transaction is in an ``Open'' status and that more research is required 
prior to a NICS ``Proceed'' or ``Denied'' response. A ``Delayed'' 
response to the FFL indicates that it would be unlawful to transfer the 
firearm until receipt of a follow-up ``Proceed'' response from the NICS 
or the expiration of three business days, whichever occurs first.
    Denied means denial of a firearm transfer based on a NICS response 
indicating one or more matching records were found providing information 
demonstrating that receipt of a firearm by a prospective transferee 
would violate 18 U.S.C. 922 or state law.
    Denying agency means a POC or the NICS Operations Center, whichever 
determines that information in the NICS indicates that the transfer of a 
firearm to a person would violate Federal or state law, based on a 
background check.
    Dial-up access means any routine access through commercial switched 
circuits on a continuous or temporary basis.
    Federal agency means any authority of the United States that is an 
``Agency'' under 44 U.S.C. 3502(1), other than those considered to be 
independent regulatory agencies, as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(10).
    FFL (federal firearms licensee) means a person licensed by the ATF 
as a manufacturer, dealer, or importer of firearms.
    Firearm has the same meaning as in 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(3).
    Licensed dealer means any person defined in 27 CFR 178.11.
    Licensed importer has the same meaning as in 27 CFR 178.11.
    Licensed manufacturer has the same meaning as in 27 CFR 178.11.
    NCIC (National Crime Information Center) means the nationwide 
computerized information system of criminal justice data established by 
the FBI as a service to local, state, and Federal criminal justice 
agencies.
    NICS means the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, 
which an FFL must, with limited exceptions, contact for information on 
whether receipt of a firearm by a person who is not licensed under 18 
U.S.C. 923 would violate Federal or state law.
    NICS Index means the database, to be managed by the FBI, containing 
information provided by Federal and state agencies about persons 
prohibited under Federal law from receiving or possessing a firearm. The 
NICS Index is separate and apart from the NCIC and the Interstate 
Identification Index (III).
    NICS operational day means the period during which the NICS 
Operations Center has its daily regular business hours.
    NICS Representative means a person who receives telephone inquiries 
to the NICS Operations Center from FFLs requesting background checks and 
provides a response as to whether the receipt or transfer of a firearm 
may proceed or is delayed.
    NRI (NICS Record Identifier) means the system-generated unique 
number associated with each record in the NICS Index.
    NTN (NICS Transaction Number) means the unique number that will be 
assigned to each valid background check inquiry received by the NICS. 
Its primary purpose will be to provide a means of associating inquiries 
to the NICS with the responses provided by the NICS to the FFLs.
    Open means those non-canceled transactions where the FFL has not 
been notified of the final determination. In cases of ``open'' 
responses, the NICS continues researching potentially prohibiting 
records regarding the transferee and, if definitive information is 
obtained, communicates to the FFL the final determination that the check 
resulted in a proceed or a deny. An ``open'' response does not prohibit 
an FFL from transferring a firearm after three business days have 
elapsed since the FFL provided to the system the identifying information 
about the prospective transferee.
    ORI (Originating Agency Identifier) means a nine-character 
identifier assigned by the FBI to an agency that has met the established 
qualifying criteria for ORI assignment to identify the agency in 
transactions on the NCIC System.

[[Page 443]]

    Originating Agency means an agency that provides a record to a 
database checked by the NICS.
    POC (Point of Contact) means a state or local law enforcement agency 
serving as an intermediary between an FFL and the federal databases 
checked by the NICS. A POC will receive NICS background check requests 
from FFLs, check state or local record systems, perform NICS inquiries, 
determine whether matching records provide information demonstrating 
that an individual is disqualified from possessing a firearm under 
Federal or state law, and respond to FFLs with the results of a NICS 
background check. A POC will be an agency with express or implied 
authority to perform POC duties pursuant to state statute, regulation, 
or executive order.
    Proceed means a NICS response indicating that the information 
available to the system at the time of the response did not demonstrate 
that transfer of the firearm would violate federal or state law. A 
``Proceed'' response would not relieve an FFL from compliance with other 
provisions of Federal or state law that may be applicable to firearms 
transfers. For example, under 18 U.S.C. 922(d), an FFL may not lawfully 
transfer a firearm if he or she knows or has reasonable cause to believe 
that the prospective recipient is prohibited by law from receiving or 
possessing a firearm.
    Record means any item, collection, or grouping of information about 
an individual that is maintained by an agency, including but not limited 
to information that disqualifies the individual from receiving a 
firearm, and that contains his or her name or other personal 
identifiers.
    STN (State-Assigned Transaction Number) means a unique number that 
may be assigned by a POC to a valid background check inquiry.
    System means the National Instant Criminal Background Check System 
(NICS).

[Order No. 2186-98, 63 FR 58307, Oct. 30, 1998, as amended by Order No. 
2727-2004, 69 FR 43900, July 23, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 25.3  System information.

    (a) There is established at the FBI a National Instant Criminal 
Background Check System.
    (b) The system will be based at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 
1000 Custer Hollow Road, Clarksburg, West Virginia 26306-0147.
    (c) The system manager and address are: Director, Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, J. Edgar Hoover F.B.I. Building, 935 Pennsylvania Avenue, 
NW, Washington, D.C. 20535.


<R05>
Sec. 25.4  Record source categories.

    It is anticipated that most records in the NICS Index will be 
obtained from Federal agencies. It is also anticipated that a limited 
number of authorized state and local law enforcement agencies will 
voluntarily contribute records to the NICS Index. Information in the 
NCIC and III systems that will be searched during a background check has 
been or will be contributed voluntarily by Federal, state, local, and 
international criminal justice agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 25.5  Validation and data integrity of records in the system.

    (a) The FBI will be responsible for maintaining data integrity 
during all NICS operations that are managed and carried out by the FBI. 
This responsibility includes:
    (1) Ensuring the accurate adding, canceling, or modifying of NICS 
Index records supplied by Federal agencies;
    (2) Automatically rejecting any attempted entry of records into the 
NICS Index that contain detectable invalid data elements;
    (3) Automatic purging of records in the NICS Index after they are on 
file for a prescribed period of time; and
    (4) Quality control checks in the form of periodic internal audits 
by FBI personnel to verify that the information provided to the NICS 
Index remains valid and correct.
    (b) Each data source will be responsible for ensuring the accuracy 
and validity of the data it provides to the NICS Index and will 
immediately correct any record determined to be invalid or incorrect.

[[Page 444]]


<R05>
Sec. 25.6  Accessing records in the system.

    (a) FFLs may initiate a NICS background check only in connection 
with a proposed firearm transfer as required by the Brady Act. FFLs are 
strictly prohibited from initiating a NICS background check for any 
other purpose. The process of accessing the NICS for the purpose of 
conducting a NICS background check is initiated by an FFL's contacting 
the FBI NICS Operations Center (by telephone or electronic dial-up 
access) or a POC. FFLs in each state will be advised by the ATF whether 
they are required to initiate NICS background checks with the NICS 
Operations Center or a POC and how they are to do so.
    (b) Access to the NICS through the FBI NICS Operations Center. FFLs 
may contact the NICS Operations Center by use of a toll-free telephone 
number, only during its regular business hours. In addition to telephone 
access, toll-free electronic dial-up access to the NICS will be provided 
to FFLs after the beginning of the NICS operation. FFLs with electronic 
dial-up access will be able to contact the NICS 24 hours each day, 
excluding scheduled and unscheduled downtime.
    (c)(1) The FBI NICS Operations Center, upon receiving an FFL 
telephone or electronic dial-up request for a background check, will:
    (i) Verify the FFL Number and code word;
    (ii) Assign a NICS Transaction Number (NTN) to a valid inquiry and 
provide the NTN to the FFL;
    (iii) Search the relevant databases (i.e., NICS Index, NCIC, III) 
for any matching records; and
    (iv) Provide the following NICS responses based upon the 
consolidated NICS search results to the FFL that requested the 
background check:
    (A) ``Proceed'' response, if no disqualifying information was found 
in the NICS Index, NCIC, or III.
    (B) ``Delayed'' response, if the NICS search finds a record that 
requires more research to determine whether the prospective transferee 
is disqualified from possessing a firearm by Federal or state law. A 
``Delayed'' response to the FFL indicates that the firearm transfer 
should not proceed pending receipt of a follow-up ``Proceed'' response 
from the NICS or the expiration of three business days (exclusive of the 
day on which the query is made), whichever occurs first. (Example: An 
FFL requests a NICS check on a prospective firearm transferee at 9:00 
a.m. on Friday and shortly thereafter receives a ``Delayed'' response 
from the NICS. If state offices in the state in which the FFL is located 
are closed on Saturday and Sunday and open the following Monday, 
Tuesday, and Wednesday, and the NICS has not yet responded with a 
``Proceed'' or ``Denied'' response, the FFL may transfer the firearm at 
12:01 a.m. Thursday.)
    (C) ``Denied'' response, when at least one matching record is found 
in either the NICS Index, NCIC, or III that provides information 
demonstrating that receipt of a firearm by the prospective transferee 
would violate 18 U.S.C. 922 or state law. The ``Denied'' response will 
be provided to the requesting FFL by the NICS Operations Center during 
its regular business hours.
    (2) None of the responses provided to the FFL under paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section will contain any of the underlying information in the 
records checked by the system.
    (d) Access to the NICS through POCs. In states where a POC is 
designated to process background checks for the NICS, FFLs will contact 
the POC to initiate a NICS background check. Both ATF and the POC will 
notify FFLs in the POC's state of the means by which FFLs can contact 
the POC. The NICS will provide POCs with electronic access to the system 
virtually 24 hours each day through the NCIC communication network. Upon 
receiving a request for a background check from an FFL, a POC will:
    (1) Verify the eligibility of the FFL either by verification of the 
FFL number or an alternative POC-verification system;
    (2) Enter a purpose code indicating that the query of the system is 
for the purpose of performing a NICS background check in connection with 
the transfer of a firearm; and (3) Transmit the request for a background 
check via the NCIC interface to the NICS.
    (e) Upon receiving a request for a NICS background check, POCs may 
also conduct a search of available files

[[Page 445]]

in state and local law enforcement and other relevant record systems, 
and may provide a unique State-Assigned Transaction Number (STN) to a 
valid inquiry for a background check.
    (f) When the NICS receives an inquiry from a POC, it will search the 
relevant databases (i.e., NICS Index, NCIC, III) for any matching 
record(s) and will provide an electronic response to the POC. This 
response will consolidate the search results of the relevant databases 
and will include the NTN. The following types of responses may be 
provided by the NICS to a state or local agency conducting a background 
check:
    (1) No record response, if the NICS determines, through a complete 
search, that no matching record exists.
    (2) Partial response, if the NICS has not completed the search of 
all of its records. This response will indicate the databases that have 
been searched (i.e., III, NCIC, and/or NICS Index) and the databases 
that have not been searched. It will also provide any potentially 
disqualifying information found in any of the databases searched. A 
follow-up response will be sent as soon as all the relevant databases 
have been searched. The follow-up response will provide the complete 
search results.
    (3) Single matching record response, if all records in the relevant 
databases have been searched and one matching record was found.
    (4) Multiple matching record response, if all records in the 
relevant databases have been searched and more than one matching record 
was found.
    (g) Generally, based on the response(s) provided by the NICS, and 
other information available in the state and local record systems, a POC 
will:
    (1) Confirm any matching records; and
    (2) Notify the FFL that the transfer may proceed, is delayed pending 
further record analysis, or is denied. ``Proceed'' notifications made 
within three business days will be accompanied by the NTN or STN 
traceable to the NTN. The POC may or may not provide a transaction 
number (NTN or STN) when notifying the FFL of a ``Denied'' response.
    (h) POC Determination Messages. POCs shall transmit electronic NICS 
transaction determination messages to the FBI for the following 
transactions: open transactions that are not resolved before the end of 
the operational day on which the check is requested; denied 
transactions; transactions reported to the NICS as open and later 
changed to proceed; and denied transactions that have been overturned. 
The FBI shall provide POCs with an electronic capability to transmit 
this information. These electronic messages shall be provided to the 
NICS immediately upon communicating the POC determination to the FFL. 
For transactions where a determination has not been communicated to the 
FFL, the electronic messages shall be communicated no later than the end 
of the operational day on which the check was initiated. With the 
exception of permit checks, newly created POC NICS transactions that are 
not followed by a determination message (deny or open) before the end of 
the operational day on which they were initiated will be assumed to have 
resulted in a proceed notification to the FFL. The information provided 
in the POC determination messages will be maintained in the NICS Audit 
Log described in Sec. 25.9(b). The NICS will destroy its records 
regarding POC determinations in accordance with the procedures detailed 
in Sec. 25.9(b).
    (i) Response recording. FFLs are required to record the system 
response, whether provided by the FBI NICS Operations Center or a POC, 
on the appropriate ATF form for audit and inspection purposes, under 27 
CFR part 178 recordkeeping requirements. The FBI NICS Operations Center 
response will always include an NTN and associated ``Proceed,'' 
``Delayed,'' or ``Denied'' determination. POC responses may vary as 
discussed in paragraph (g) of this section. In these instances, FFLs 
will record the POC response, including any transaction number and/or 
determination.
    (j) Access to the NICS Index for purposes unrelated to NICS 
background checks required by the Brady Act. Access to the NICS Index 
for purposes unrelated to NICS background checks pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 
922(t) shall be limited to uses for the purpose of:

[[Page 446]]

    (1) Providing information to Federal, state, or local criminal 
justice agencies in connection with the issuance of a firearm-related or 
explosives-related permit or license, including permits or licenses to 
possess, acquire, or transfer a firearm, or to carry a concealed 
firearm, or to import, manufacture, deal in, or purchase explosives; or
    (2) Responding to an inquiry from the ATF in connection with a civil 
or criminal law enforcement activity relating to the Gun Control Act (18 
U.S.C. Chapter 44) or the National Firearms Act (26 U.S.C. Chapter 53).

[Order No. 2186-98, 63 FR 58307, Oct. 30, 1998, as amended by Order No. 
2727-2004, 69 FR 43900, July 23, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 25.7  Querying records in the system.

    (a) The following search descriptors will be required in all queries 
of the system for purposes of a background check:
    (1) Name;
    (2) Sex;
    (3) Race;
    (4) Complete date of birth; and
    (5) State of residence.
    (b) A unique numeric identifier may also be provided to search for 
additional records based on exact matches by the numeric identifier. 
Examples of unique numeric identifiers for purposes of this system are: 
Social Security number (to comply with Privacy Act requirements, a 
Social Security number will not be required by the NICS to perform any 
background check) and miscellaneous identifying numbers (e.g., military 
number or number assigned by Federal, state, or local authorities to an 
individual's record). Additional identifiers that may be requested by 
the system after an initial query include height, weight, eye and hair 
color, and place of birth. At the option of the querying agency, these 
additional identifiers may also be included in the initial query of the 
system.


<R05>
Sec. 25.8  System safeguards.

    (a) Information maintained in the NICS Index is stored 
electronically for use in an FBI computer environment. The NICS central 
computer will reside inside a locked room within a secure facility. 
Access to the facility will be restricted to authorized personnel who 
have identified themselves and their need for access to a system 
security officer.
    (b) Access to data stored in the NICS is restricted to duly 
authorized agencies. The security measures listed in paragraphs (c) 
through (f) of this section are the minimum to be adopted by all POCs 
and data sources having access to the NICS.
    (c) State or local law enforcement agency computer centers 
designated by a Control Terminal Agency as POCs shall be authorized NCIC 
users and shall observe all procedures set forth in the NCIC Security 
Policy of 1992 when processing NICS background checks. The 
responsibilities of the Control Terminal Agencies and the computer 
centers include the following:
    (1) The criminal justice agency computer site must have adequate 
physical security to protect against any unauthorized personnel gaining 
access to the computer equipment or to any of the stored data.
    (2) Since personnel at these computer centers can have access to 
data stored in the NICS, they must be screened thoroughly under the 
authority and supervision of a state Control Terminal Agency. This 
authority and supervision may be delegated to responsible criminal 
justice agency personnel in the case of a satellite computer center 
being serviced through a state Control Terminal Agency. This screening 
will also apply to non-criminal justice maintenance or technical 
personnel.
    (3) All visitors to these computer centers must be accompanied by 
staff personnel at all times.
    (4) POCs utilizing a state/NCIC terminal to access the NICS must 
have the proper computer instructions written and other built-in 
controls to prevent data from being accessible to any terminals other 
than authorized terminals.
    (5) Each state Control Terminal Agency shall build its data system 
around a central computer, through which each inquiry must pass for 
screening and verification.
    (d) Authorized state agency remote terminal devices operated by POCs 
and having access to the NICS must meet the following requirements:

[[Page 447]]

    (1) POCs and data sources having terminals with access to the NICS 
must physically place these terminals in secure locations within the 
authorized agency;
    (2) The agencies having terminals with access to the NICS must 
screen terminal operators and must restrict access to the terminals to a 
minimum number of authorized employees; and
    (3) Copies of NICS data obtained from terminal devices must be 
afforded appropriate security to prevent any unauthorized access or use.
    (e) FFL remote terminal devices may be used to transmit queries to 
the NICS via electronic dial-up access. The following procedures will 
apply to such queries:
    (1) The NICS will incorporate a security authentication mechanism 
that performs FFL dial-up user authentication before network access 
takes place;
    (2) The proper use of dial-up circuits by FFLs will be included as 
part of the periodic audits by the FBI; and
    (3) All failed authentications will be logged by the NICS and 
provided to the NICS security administrator.
    (f) FFLs may use the telephone to transmit queries to the NICS, in 
accordance with the following procedures:
    (1) FFLs may contact the NICS Operations Center during its regular 
business hours by a telephone number provided by the FBI;
    (2) FFLs will provide the NICS Representative with their FFL Number 
and code word, the type of sale, and the name, sex, race, date of birth, 
and state of residence of the prospective buyer; and
    (3) The NICS will verify the FFL Number and code word before 
processing the request.
    (g) The following precautions will be taken to help ensure the 
security and privacy of NICS information when FFLs contact the NICS 
Operations Center:
    (1) Access will be restricted to the initiation of a NICS background 
check in connection with the proposed transfer of a firearm.
    (2) The NICS Representative will only provide a response of 
``Proceed'' or ``Delayed'' (with regard to the prospective firearms 
transfer), and will not provide the details of any record information 
about the transferee. In cases where potentially disqualifying 
information is found in response to an FFL query, the NICS 
Representative will provide a ``Delayed'' response to the FFL. Follow-up 
``Proceed'' or ``Denied'' responses will be provided by the NICS 
Operations Center during its regular business hours.
    (3) The FBI will periodically monitor telephone inquiries to ensure 
proper use of the system.
    (h) All transactions and messages sent and received through 
electronic access by POCs and FFLs will be automatically logged in the 
NICS Audit Log described in Sec. 25.9(b). Information in the NICS Audit 
Log will include initiation and termination messages, failed 
authentications, and matching records located by each search 
transaction.
    (i) The FBI will monitor and enforce compliance by NICS users with 
the applicable system security requirements outlined in the NICS POC 
Guidelines and the NICS FFL Manual (available from the NICS Operations 
Center, Federal Bureau of Investigation, 1000 Custer Hollow Road, 
Clarksburg, West Virginia 26306-0147).


<R05>
Sec. 25.9  Retention and destruction of records in the system.

    (a) The NICS will retain NICS Index records that indicate that 
receipt of a firearm by the individuals to whom the records pertain 
would violate Federal or state law. The NICS will retain such records 
indefinitely, unless they are canceled by the originating agency. In 
cases where a firearms disability is not permanent, e.g., a 
disqualifying restraining order, the NICS will automatically purge the 
pertinent record when it is no longer disqualifying. Unless otherwise 
removed, records contained in the NCIC and III files that are accessed 
during a background check will remain in those files in accordance with 
established policy.
    (b) The FBI will maintain an automated NICS Audit Log of all 
incoming and outgoing transactions that pass through the system.
    (1) Contents. The NICS Audit Log will record the following 
information: Type of transaction (inquiry or response),

[[Page 448]]

line number, time, date of inquiry, header, message key, ORI or FFL 
identifier, and inquiry/response data (including the name and other 
identifying information about the prospective transferee and the NTN).
    (i) NICS Audit Log records relating to denied transactions will be 
retained for 10 years, after which time they will be transferred to a 
Federal Records Center for storage;
    (ii) NICS Audit Log records relating to transactions in an open 
status, except the NTN and date, will be destroyed after not more than 
90 days from the date of inquiry; and
    (iii) In cases of NICS Audit Log records relating to allowed 
transactions, all identifying information submitted by or on behalf of 
the transferee will be destroyed within 24 hours after the FFL receives 
communication of the determination that the transfer may proceed. All 
other information, except the NTN and date, will be destroyed after not 
more than 90 days from the date of inquiry.
    (2) Use of information in the NICS Audit Log. The NICS Audit Log 
will be used to analyze system performance, assist users in resolving 
operational problems, support the appeals process, or support audits of 
the use and performance of the system. Searches may be conducted on the 
Audit Log by time frame, i.e., by day or month, or by a particular state 
or agency. Information in the NICS Audit Log pertaining to allowed 
transactions may be accessed directly only by the FBI and only for the 
purpose of conducting audits of the use and performance of the NICS, 
except that:
    (i) Information in the NICS Audit Log, including information not yet 
destroyed under Sec. 5.9(b)(1)(iii), that indicates, either on its face 
or in conjunction with other information, a violation or potential 
violation of law or regulation, may be shared with appropriate 
authorities responsible for investigating, prosecuting, and/or enforcing 
such law or regulation; and
    (ii) The NTNs and dates for allowed transactions may be shared with 
ATF in Individual FFL Audit Logs as specified in Sec. 25.9(b)(4).
    (3) Limitation on use. The NICS, including the NICS Audit Log, may 
not be used by any Department, agency, officer, or employee of the 
United States to establish any system for the registration of firearms, 
firearm owners, or firearm transactions or dispositions, except with 
respect to persons prohibited from receiving a firearm by 18 U.S.C. 
922(g) or (n) or by state law. The NICS Audit Log will be monitored and 
reviewed on a regular basis to detect any possible misuse of NICS data.
    (4) Creation and Use of Individual FFL Audit Logs. Upon written 
request from ATF containing the name and license number of the FFL and 
the proposed date of inspection of the named FFL by ATF, the FBI may 
extract information from the NICS Audit Log and create an Individual FFL 
Audit Log for transactions originating at the named FFL for a limited 
period of time. An Individual FFL Audit Log shall contain all 
information on denied transactions, and, with respect to all other 
transactions, only non-identifying information from the transaction. In 
no instance shall an Individual FFL Audit Log contain more than 60 days 
worth of allowed or open transaction records originating at the FFL. The 
FBI will provide POC states the means to provide to the FBI information 
that will allow the FBI to generate Individual FFL Audit Logs in 
connection with ATF inspections of FFLs in POC states. POC states that 
elect not to have the FBI generate Individual FFL Audit Logs for FFLs in 
their states must develop a means by which the POC will provide such 
Logs to ATF.
    (c) The following records in the FBI-operated terminals of the NICS 
will be subject to the Brady Act's requirements for destruction:
    (1) All inquiry and response messages (regardless of media) relating 
to a background check that results in an allowed transfer; and
    (2) All information (regardless of media) contained in the NICS 
Audit Log relating to a background check that results in an allowed 
transfer.
    (d) The following records of state and local law enforcement units 
serving as POCs will be subject to the Brady Act's requirements for 
destruction:
    (1) All inquiry and response messages (regardless of media) relating 
to the initiation and result of a check of the

[[Page 449]]

NICS that allows a transfer that are not part of a record system created 
and maintained pursuant to independent state law regarding firearms 
transactions; and
    (2) All other records relating to the person or the transfer created 
as a result of a NICS check that are not part of a record system created 
and maintained pursuant to independent state law regarding firearms 
transactions.

[Order No. 2186-98, 63 FR 58307, Oct. 30, 1998, as amended by Order No. 
2354-2001, 66 FR 6474, Jan. 22, 2001; Order No. 2727-2004, 69 FR 43900, 
July 23, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 25.10  Correction of erroneous system information.

    (a) An individual may request the reason for the denial from the 
agency that conducted the check of the NICS (the ``denying agency,'' 
which will be either the FBI or the state or local law enforcement 
agency serving as a POC). The FFL will provide to the denied individual 
the name and address of the denying agency and the unique transaction 
number (NTN or STN) associated with the NICS background check. The 
request for the reason for the denial must be made in writing to the 
denying agency. (POCs at their discretion may waive the requirement for 
a written request.)
    (b) The denying agency will respond to the individual with the 
reasons for the denial within five business days of its receipt of the 
individual's request. The response should indicate whether additional 
information or documents are required to support an appeal, such as 
fingerprints in appeals involving questions of identity (i.e., a claim 
that the record in question does not pertain to the individual who was 
denied).
    (c) If the individual wishes to challenge the accuracy of the record 
upon which the denial is based, or if the individual wishes to assert 
that his or her rights to possess a firearm have been restored, he or 
she may make application first to the denying agency, i.e., either the 
FBI or the POC. If the denying agency is unable to resolve the appeal, 
the denying agency will so notify the individual and shall provide the 
name and address of the agency that originated the document containing 
the information upon which the denial was based. The individual may then 
apply for correction of the record directly to the agency from which it 
originated. If the record is corrected as a result of the appeal to the 
originating agency, the individual may so notify the denying agency, 
which will, in turn, verify the record correction with the originating 
agency (assuming the originating agency has not already notified the 
denying agency of the correction) and take all necessary steps to 
correct the record in the NICS.
    (d) As an alternative to the above procedure where a POC was the 
denying agency, the individual may elect to direct his or her challenge 
to the accuracy of the record, in writing, to the FBI, NICS Operations 
Center, Criminal Justice Information Services Division, 1000 Custer 
Hollow Road, Module C-3, Clarksburg, West Virginia 26306-0147. Upon 
receipt of the information, the FBI will investigate the matter by 
contacting the POC that denied the transaction or the data source. The 
FBI will request the POC or the data source to verify that the record in 
question pertains to the individual who was denied, or to verify or 
correct the challenged record. The FBI will consider the information it 
receives from the individual and the response it receives from the POC 
or the data source. If the record is corrected as a result of the 
challenge, the FBI shall so notify the individual, correct the erroneous 
information in the NICS, and give notice of the error to any Federal 
department or agency or any state that was the source of such erroneous 
records.
    (e) Upon receipt of notice of the correction of a contested record 
from the originating agency, the FBI or the agency that contributed the 
record shall correct the data in the NICS and the denying agency shall 
provide a written confirmation of the correction of the erroneous data 
to the individual for presentation to the FFL. If the appeal of a 
contested record is successful and thirty (30) days or less have 
transpired since the initial check, and there are no other disqualifying 
records upon which the denial was based, the NICS will communicate a 
``Proceed'' response to the FFL. If the appeal is successful and more 
than thirty (30) days have transpired since

[[Page 450]]

the initial check, the FFL must recheck the NICS before allowing the 
sale to continue. In cases where multiple disqualifying records are the 
basis for the denial, the individual must pursue a correction for each 
record.
    (f) An individual may also contest the accuracy or validity of a 
disqualifying record by bringing an action against the state or 
political subdivision responsible for providing the contested 
information, or responsible for denying the transfer, or against the 
United States, as the case may be, for an order directing that the 
contested information be corrected or that the firearm transfer be 
approved.
    (g) An individual may provide written consent to the FBI to maintain 
information about himself or herself in a Voluntary Appeal File to be 
established by the FBI and checked by the NICS for the purpose of 
preventing the future erroneous denial or extended delay by the NICS of 
a firearm transfer. Such file shall be used only by the NICS for this 
purpose. The FBI shall remove all information in the Voluntary Appeal 
File pertaining to an individual upon receipt of a written request by 
that individual. However, the FBI may retain such information contained 
in the Voluntary Appeal File as long as needed to pursue cases of 
identified misuse of the system. If the FBI finds a disqualifying record 
on the individual after his or her entry into the Voluntary Appeal File, 
the FBI may remove the individual's information from the file.

[Order No. 2186-98, 63 FR 58307, Oct. 30, 1998, as amended by Order No. 
2727-2004, 69 FR 43901, July 23, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 25.11  Prohibited activities and penalties.

    (a) State or local agencies, FFLs, or individuals violating this 
subpart A shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $10,000 and subject 
to cancellation of NICS inquiry privileges.
    (b) Misuse or unauthorized access includes, but is not limited to, 
the following:
    (1) State or local agencies', FFLs', or individuals' purposefully 
furnishing incorrect information to the system to obtain a ``Proceed'' 
response, thereby allowing a firearm transfer;
    (2) State or local agencies', FFLs', or individuals' purposefully 
using the system to perform a check for unauthorized purposes; and
    (3) Any unauthorized person's accessing the NICS.

of information to the Department of Justice's (Department's) Office of 
Professional Responsibility (OPR), the Department's Office of Inspector 
General (OIG), the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility (FBI OPR) 
(collectively, Receiving Offices), the Attorney General, the Deputy 
Attorney General, the Director of the FBI, the Deputy Director of the 
FBI, or to the highest ranking official in any FBI field office, the 
disclosure will be a ``protected disclosure'' if the person making it 
reasonably believes that it evidences:
    (1) A violation of any law, rule or regulation; or
    (2) Mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or 
a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.
    (b) Any office or official (other than the OIG or OPR) receiving a 
protected disclosure shall promptly report such disclosure to the OIG or 
OPR for investigation. The OIG and OPR shall proceed in accordance with 
procedures establishing their respective jurisdiction. The OIG or OPR 
may refer such allegations to FBI-OPR for investigation unless the 
Deputy Attorney General determines that such referral shall not be made.

(xi) of 5 U.S.C. 2302(a)(2)(A) taken with respect to an FBI employee 
other than one in a position which the Attorney General has designated 
in advance of encumbrance as being a position of a confidential, policy-
determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character.

                                 Action


<R05>
Sec. 27.3  Investigations: The Department of Justice's Office of Professional 

Responsibility and Office of the Inspector General.

    (a)(1) An FBI employee who believes that another employee of the 
FBI, or of any other Departmental component, has taken or has failed to 
take a personnel action as a reprisal for a protected disclosure 
(reprisal), may report the alleged reprisal to either the Department's 
OPR or the Department's OIG (collectively, Investigative Offices). The 
report of an alleged reprisal must be made in writing.
    (2) For purposes of this subpart, references to the FBI include any 
other Departmental component in which the person or persons accused of 
the reprisal were employed at the time of the alleged reprisal.
    (b) The Investigative Office that receives the report of an alleged 
reprisal shall consult with the other Investigative Office to determine 
which office is more suited, under the circumstances, to conduct an 
investigation into the allegation. The Attorney General retains final 
authority to designate or redesignate the Investigative Office that will 
conduct an investigation.
    (c) Within 15 calendar days of the date the allegation of reprisal 
is first received by an Investigative Office, the office that will 
conduct the investigation (Conducting Office) shall provide written 
notice to the person who made the allegation (Complainant) indicating--
    (1) That the allegation has been received; and
    (2) The name of a person within the Conducting Office who will serve 
as a contact with the Complainant.
    (d) The Conducting Office shall investigate any allegation of 
reprisal to the extent necessary to determine whether there are 
reasonable grounds to believe that a reprisal has been or will be taken.
    (e) Within 90 calendar days of providing the notice required in 
paragraph (c) of this section, and at least every 60 calendar days 
thereafter (or at any other time if the Conducting Office deems 
appropriate), the Conducting Office shall notify the Complainant of the 
status of the investigation.
    (f) The Conducting Office shall determine whether there are 
reasonable grounds to believe that there has been or will be a reprisal 
for a protected disclosure. The Conducting Office shall make this 
determination within 240 calendar days of receiving the allegation of 
reprisal unless the Complainant agrees to an extension.
    (g) If the Conducting Office decides to terminate an investigation, 
it shall provide, no later than 10 business days before providing the 
written statement required by paragraph (h) of this section, a written 
status report to the Complainant containing the factual findings and 
conclusions justifying the termination of the investigation. The 
Complainant may submit written comments on such report to the Conducting 
Office. The Conducting Office shall not be required to provide a 
subsequent written status report after submission of such comments.
    (h) If the Conducting Office terminates an investigation, it shall 
prepare and transmit to the Complainant a written statement notifying 
him/her of--
    (1) The termination of the investigation;
    (2) A summary of relevant facts ascertained by the Conducting 
Office;
    (3) The reasons for termination of the investigation; and
    (4) A response to any comments submitted under paragraph (g) of this 
section.
    (i) Such written statement prepared pursuant to paragraph (h) of 
this section may not be admissible as evidence in any subsequent 
proceeding without the consent of the Complainant.
    (j) Nothing in this part shall prohibit the Receiving Offices, in 
the absence of

[[Page 454]]

a reprisal allegation by an FBI employee under this part, from 
conducting an investigation, under their pre-existing jurisdiction, to 
determine whether a reprisal has been or will be taken.


<R05>
Sec. 27.4  Corrective action and other relief; Director, Office of Attorney 

Recruitment and Management.

    (a) If, in connection with any investigation, the Conducting Office 
determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a reprisal 
has been or will be taken, the Conducting Office shall report this 
conclusion, together with any findings and recommendations for 
corrective action, to the Director, Office of Attorney Recruitment and 
Management (the Director). If the Conducting Office's report to the 
Director includes a recommendation for corrective action, the Director 
shall provide an opportunity for comments on the report by the FBI and 
the Complainant. The Director, upon receipt of the Conducting Office's 
report, shall proceed in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. 
A determination by the Conducting Office that there are reasonable 
grounds to believe a reprisal has been or will be taken shall not be 
cited or referred to in any proceeding under these regulations, without 
the Complainant's consent.
    (b) At any time, the Conducting Office may request the Director to 
order a stay of any personnel action for 45 calendar days if it 
determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a reprisal 
has been or is to be taken. The Director shall order such stay within 
three business days of receiving the request for stay, unless the 
Director determines that, under the facts and circumstances involved, 
such a stay would not be appropriate. The Director may extend the period 
of any stay granted under this paragraph for any period that the 
Director considers appropriate. The Director shall allow the FBI an 
opportunity to comment to the Director on any proposed extension of a 
stay, and may request additional information as the Director deems 
necessary. The Director may terminate a stay at any time, except that no 
such termination shall occur until the Complainant and the Conducting 
Office shall first have had notice and an opportunity to comment.
    (c)(1) The Complainant may present a request for corrective action 
directly to the Director within 60 calendar days of receipt of 
notification of termination of an investigation by the Conducting Office 
or at any time after 120 calendar days from the date the Complainant 
first notified an Investigative Office of an alleged reprisal if the 
Complainant has not been notified by the Conducting Office that it will 
seek corrective action. The Director shall notify the FBI of the receipt 
of the request and allow the FBI 25 calendar days to respond in writing. 
If the Complainant presents a request for corrective action to the 
Director under this paragraph, the Conducting Office may continue to 
seek corrective action specific to the Complainant, including the 
submission of a report to the Director, only with the Complainant's 
consent. Notwithstanding the Complainant's refusal of such consent, the 
Conducting Office may continue to investigate any violation of law, 
rule, or regulation.
    (2) The Director may not direct the Conducting Office to reinstate 
an investigation that the Conducting Office has terminated in accordance 
with Sec. 27.3(h).
    (d) Where a Complainant has presented a request for corrective 
action to the Director under paragraph (c) of this section, the 
Complainant may at any time request the Director to order a stay of any 
personnel action allegedly taken or to be taken in reprisal for a 
protected disclosure. The request for a stay must be in writing, and the 
FBI shall have an opportunity to respond. The request shall be granted 
within 10 business days of the receipt of any response by the FBI if the 
Director determines that such a stay would be appropriate. A stay 
granted under this paragraph shall remain in effect for such period as 
the Director deems appropriate. The Director may modify or dissolve a 
stay under this paragraph at any time if the Director determines that 
such a modification or dissolution is appropriate.
    (e)(1) The Director shall determine, based upon all the evidence, 
whether a protected disclosure was a contributing

[[Page 455]]

factor in a personnel action taken or to be taken. Subject to paragraph 
(e)(2) of this section, if the Director determines that a protected 
disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action taken or to 
be taken, the Director shall order corrective action as the Director 
deems appropriate. The Director may conclude that the disclosure was a 
contributing factor in the personnel action based upon circumstantial 
evidence, such as evidence that the employee taking the personnel action 
knew of the disclosure or that the personnel action occurred within a 
period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the 
disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action.
    (2) Corrective action may not be ordered if the FBI demonstrates by 
clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same 
personnel action in the absence of such disclosure.
    (3) In making the determinations required under this subsection, the 
Director may hold a hearing at which the Complainant may present 
evidence in support of his or her claim, in accordance with such 
procedures as the Director may adopt. The Director is hereby authorized 
to compel the attendance and testimony of, or the production of 
documentary or other evidence from, any person employed by the 
Department if doing so appears reasonably calculated to lead to the 
discovery of admissible evidence, is not otherwise prohibited by law or 
regulation, and is not unduly burdensome. Any privilege available in 
judicial and administrative proceedings relating to the disclosure of 
documents or the giving of testimony shall be available before the 
Director. All assertions of such privileges shall be decided by the 
Director. The Director may, upon request, certify a ruling on an 
assertion of privilege for review by the Deputy Attorney General.
    (f) If the Director orders corrective action, such corrective action 
may include: placing the Complainant, as nearly as possible, in the 
position he would have been in had the reprisal not taken place; 
reimbursement for attorneys fees, reasonable costs, medical costs 
incurred, and travel expenses; back pay and related benefits; and any 
other reasonable and foreseeable consequential damages.
    (g) If the Director determines that there has not been a reprisal, 
the Director shall report this finding in writing to the complainant, 
the FBI, and the Conducting Office.

[Order No. 2264-99, 64 FR 58786, Nov. 1, 1999, as amended by Order No. 
2492-2001, 66 FR 37904, July 20, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 27.5  Review.

    The Complainant or the FBI may request, within 30 calendar days of a 
final determination or corrective action order by the Director, review 
by the Deputy Attorney General of that determination or order. The 
Deputy Attorney General shall set aside or modify the Director's 
actions, findings, or conclusions found to be arbitrary, capricious, an 
abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; obtained 
without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been 
followed; or unsupported by substantial evidence. The Deputy Attorney 
General has full discretion to review and modify corrective action 
ordered by the Director, provided, however that if the Deputy Attorney 
General upholds a finding that there has been a reprisal, then the 
Deputy Attorney general shall order appropriate corrective action.


<R05>
Sec. 27.6  Extensions of time.

    The Director may extend, for extenuating circumstances, any of the 
time limits provided in these regulations relating to proceedings before 
him and to requests for review by the Deputy Attorney General.

              Subpart C_Preservation of Biological Evidence

    Source: Order No. 2762-2005, 70 FR 21957, Apr. 28, 2005, unless 
otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 28.21  Purpose.

    Section 3600A of title 18 of the United States Code (``section 
3600A'') requires the Government to preserve biological evidence that 
was secured in the investigation or prosecution of a Federal offense, if 
a defendant is under a sentence of imprisonment for such offense, 
subject to certain limitations and exceptions. The general purpose of 
this requirement is to preserve biological evidence for possible DNA 
testing under 18 U.S.C. 3600. Subsection (e) of section 3600A requires 
the Attorney General to promulgate regulations to implement and enforce 
section 3600A, including appropriate disciplinary sanctions to ensure 
that employees comply with such regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 28.22  The requirement to preserve biological evidence.

    (a) Applicability in general. The requirement of section 3600A to 
preserve biological evidence applies to evidence that has been retained 
in cases in which the offense or conviction occurred prior to the 
enactment of section 3600A or the adoption of this subpart, as well as 
to evidence secured in pending and future cases.
    (b) Limitation to circumstances in which a defendant is under a 
sentence of imprisonment for the offense. The requirement of section 
3600A to preserve

[[Page 458]]

biological evidence secured in the investigation or prosecution of a 
Federal offense begins to apply when a defendant is convicted and 
sentenced to imprisonment for the offense, and ceases to apply when the 
defendant or defendants are released following such imprisonment. The 
evidence preservation requirement of section 3600A does not apply in the 
following situations:
    (1) Inapplicability at the investigative stage. The requirement of 
section 3600A to preserve biological evidence does not apply at the 
investigative stage of criminal cases, occurring prior to the conviction 
and sentencing to imprisonment of a defendant. Biological evidence may 
be collected and preserved in the investigation of Federal offenses 
prior to the sentencing of a defendant to imprisonment, reflecting sound 
investigative practice and the need for evidence in trial proceedings 
that may result from the investigation, but section 3600A does not 
govern these activities.
    (2) Inapplicability to cases involving only non-incarcerative 
sentences. The requirement of section 3600A to preserve biological 
evidence does not apply in cases in which defendants receive only 
nonincarcerative sentences, such as probation, fines, or payment of 
restitution.
    (3) Inapplicability following release. The requirement of section 
3600A to preserve biological evidence ceases to apply when the defendant 
or defendants are released following imprisonment, either 
unconditionally or under supervision. The requirement does not apply 
during any period following the release of the defendant or defendants 
from imprisonment, even if the defendant or defendants remain on 
supervised release or parole.
    (4) Inapplicability following revocation of release. The requirement 
of section 3600A to preserve biological evidence applies during a 
defendant's imprisonment pursuant to the sentence imposed upon 
conviction of the offense, as opposed to later imprisonment resulting 
from a violation of release conditions. The requirement does not apply 
during any period in which the defendant or defendants are imprisoned 
based on the revocation of probation, supervised release, or parole.
    (c) Conditions of preservation. The requirement of section 3600A to 
preserve biological evidence means that such evidence cannot be 
destroyed or disposed of under the circumstances in which section 3600A 
requires its preservation, but does not limit agency discretion 
concerning the conditions under which biological evidence is maintained 
or the transfer of biological evidence among different agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 28.23  Evidence subject to the preservation requirement.

    (a) Biological evidence generally. The evidence preservation 
requirement of section 3600A applies to ``biological evidence,'' which 
is defined in section 3600A(b). The covered evidence is sexual assault 
forensic examination kits under section 3600A(b)(1) and semen, blood, 
saliva, hair, skin tissue, or other identified biological material under 
section 3600A(b)(2).
    (b) Biological evidence under section 3600A(b)(2). Biological 
evidence within the scope of section 3600A(b)(2) is identified 
biological material that may derive from a perpetrator of the offense, 
and hence might be capable of shedding light on the question of a 
defendant's guilt or innocence through DNA testing to determine whether 
the defendant is the source of the material. In greater detail, evidence 
within the scope of section 3600A(b)(2) encompasses the following:
    (1) Identified biological material. Beyond sexual assault forensic 
examination kits, which are specially referenced in section 3600A(b)(1), 
section 3600A requires preservation only of evidence that is detected 
and identified as semen, blood, saliva, hair, skin tissue, or some other 
type of biological material. Section 3600A's preservation requirement 
does not apply to an item of evidence merely because it is known on 
theoretical grounds that physical things that have been in proximity to 
human beings almost invariably contain unidentified and imperceptible 
amounts of their organic matter.
    (2) Material that may derive from a perpetrator of the crime. 
Biological evidence within the scope of section 3600A(b)(2) must 
constitute ``biological material.'' In the context of section 3600A, 
this term does not encompass all

[[Page 459]]

possible types of organic matter, but rather refers to organic matter 
that may derive from the body of a perpetrator of the crime, and hence 
might be capable of shedding light on a defendant's guilt or innocence 
by including or excluding the defendant as the source of its DNA.

    Example 1. In a murder case in which the victim struggled with the 
killer, scrapings of skin tissue or blood taken from under the victim's 
fingernails would constitute biological material in the sense of section 
3600A(b)(2), and would be subject to section 3600A's requirement to 
preserve biological evidence, assuming satisfaction of the statute's 
other conditions. Such material, which apparently derives from the 
perpetrator of the crime, could potentially shed light on guilt or 
innocence through DNA testing under 18 U.S.C. 3600 to determine whether 
a defendant was the source of this material.
    Example 2. Biological material in the sense of section 3600A(b)(2) 
would not include the body of a murder victim who was shot from a 
distance, the carcasses of cattle in a meat truck secured in an 
investigation of the truck's hijacking, a quantity of marijuana seized 
in a drug trafficking investigation, or articles made from wood or from 
wool or cotton fiber. While such items of evidence constitute organic 
matter in a broader sense, they are not biological material within the 
scope of section 3600A(b)(2), because they do not derive from the body 
of a perpetrator of the crime, and hence could not shed light on a 
defendant's guilt or innocence through DNA testing under 18 U.S.C. 3600 
to determine whether the defendant is the source of the evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 28.24  Exceptions based on the results of judicial proceedings.

    Subsection (c) of section 3600A makes the biological evidence 
preservation requirement inapplicable in two circumstances relating to 
the results of judicial proceedings:
    (a) Judicial denial of DNA testing. Section 3600A(c)(1) exempts 
situations in which a court has denied a motion for DNA testing under 18 
U.S.C. 3600 and no appeal is pending.
    (b) Inclusion of defendant as source. Section 3600A(c)(5) exempts 
situations in which there has been DNA testing under 18 U.S.C. 3600 and 
the results included the defendant as the source of the evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 28.25  Exceptions based on a defendant's conduct.

    Subsection (c) of section 3600A makes the biological evidence 
preservation requirement inapplicable in two circumstances relating to 
action (or inaction) by the defendant:
    (a) Waiver by defendant. Section 3600A(c)(2) makes the biological 
evidence preservation requirement inapplicable if the defendant 
knowingly and voluntarily waived DNA testing in a court proceeding 
conducted after the date of enactment, i.e., after October 30, 2004. 
Hence, for example, if a defendant waives DNA testing in the context of 
a plea agreement, in a pretrial colloquy with the court, in the course 
of discovery in pretrial proceedings, or in a postconviction proceeding, 
and the proceeding in which the waiver occurs takes place after October 
30, 2004, the biological evidence preservation requirement of section 
3600A does not apply.
    (b) Notice to defendant. (1) Section 3600A(c)(3) makes the 
biological evidence preservation requirement inapplicable if the 
defendant is notified that the biological evidence may be destroyed 
``after a conviction becomes final and the defendant has exhausted all 
opportunities for direct review of the conviction,'' and ``the defendant 
does not file a motion under section 3600 within 180 days of receipt of 
the notice.''
    (2) Effective notice concerning the possible destruction of 
biological evidence for purposes of section 3600A(c)(3) cannot be given 
if the case is pending on direct review of the conviction before a court 
of appeals or the Supreme Court, if time remains for the defendant to 
file a notice of appeal from the judgment of conviction in the court of 
appeals, or if time remains for the defendant to file a petition for 
certiorari to the Supreme Court following the court of appeals' 
determination of an appeal of the conviction.
    (3) Once direct review has been completed, or the time for seeking 
direct review has expired, section 3600A(c)(3) allows notice to the 
defendant that biological evidence may be destroyed. The biological 
evidence preservation requirement of section 3600A thereafter does not 
apply, unless the defendant

[[Page 460]]

files a motion under 18 U.S.C. 3600 within 180 days of receipt of the 
notice. Notice to a defendant that biological evidence may be destroyed 
may be provided by certified mail, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons 
shall create a record concerning the delivery of such mail to an inmate. 
To determine whether a defendant has filed a motion under 18 U.S.C. 3600 
within 180 days of receipt of such a notice, the agency providing the 
notice may obtain confirmation of delivery and the date of delivery by 
inquiry with the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and may ascertain whether 
the defendant has filed a motion under 18 U.S.C. 3600 within 180 days of 
that date by checking the records of the district court which entered 
the judgment of conviction of the defendant for the offense or asking 
the United States Attorney's office in that district.


<R05>
Sec. 28.26  Exceptions based on the nature of the evidence.

    Subsection (c)(4) of section 3600A provides that the section's 
biological evidence preservation requirement does not apply if ``the 
evidence must be returned to its rightful owner, or is of such a size, 
bulk, or physical character as to render retention impracticable.'' This 
exception is subject to the condition that the Government must ``take[] 
reasonable measures to remove and preserve portions of the material 
evidence sufficient to permit future DNA testing.''
    (a) Evidence not retained beyond the investigative stage. Section 
3600A(c)(4) has no application if items of the sort it describes--e.g., 
items that must be returned to the rightful owner, or items that are so 
large that their retention is impracticable--are not kept until the time 
when a defendant is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment. 
Investigative agents may take samples from such items during the 
investigative stage of the case, in accordance with their judgment about 
what is needed for purposes of DNA testing or other evidentiary use, or 
may conclude that the nature of the items does not warrant taking such 
samples, and the items themselves may then be returned to the owners or 
otherwise disposed of prior to the trial, conviction, or sentencing of 
any defendant. In such cases, section 3600A is inapplicable, because its 
evidence preservation requirement does not apply at all until a 
defendant is sentenced to imprisonment, as noted in Sec. 28.22(b)(1).
    (b) Evidence not constituting biological material. It is rarely the 
case that a bulky item of the sort described in section 3600A(c)(4), or 
a large part of such an item, constitutes biological evidence as defined 
in section 3600A(b). If such an item is not biological evidence in the 
relevant sense, it is outside the scope of section 3600A. For example, 
the evidence secured in the investigation of a bank robbery may include 
a stolen car that was used in the getaway, and there may be some item in 
the car containing biological material that derives from a perpetrator 
of the crime, such as saliva on a discarded cigarette butt. Even if the 
vehicle is kept until a defendant is sentenced to imprisonment, section 
3600A's preservation requirement would not apply to the vehicle as such, 
because the vehicle is not biological material. It would be sufficient 
for compliance with section 3600A to preserve the particular items in 
the vehicle that contain identified biological material or portions of 
them that contain the biological material.
    (c) Preservation of portions sufficient for DNA testing. If evidence 
described in section 3600A(c)(4) is not otherwise exempt from the 
preservation requirement of section 3600A, and section 3600A(c)(4) is 
relied on in disposing of such evidence, reasonable measures must be 
taken to preserve portions of the evidence sufficient to permit future 
DNA testing. For example, considering a stolen car used in a bank 
robbery, it may be the case that one of the robbers was shot during the 
getaway and bled all over the interior of the car. In such a case, if 
the car is kept until a defendant is sentenced to imprisonment for the 
crime, there would be extensive biological material in the car that 
would potentially be subject to section 3600A's requirement to preserve 
biological evidence. Moreover, the biological material in question could 
not be fully preserved without retaining the whole car or removing and 
retaining large amounts of matter from the interior of the car. Section 
3600A(c)(4) would be relevant in such a case, given

[[Page 461]]

that fully retaining the biological evidence is likely to be 
impracticable or inconsistent with the rightful owner's entitlement to 
the return of the vehicle. In such a case, section 3600A(c)(4) could be 
relied on, and its requirements would be satisfied if samples of the 
blood were preserved sufficient to permit future DNA testing. Preserving 
such samples would dispense with any need under section 3600A to retain 
the vehicle itself or larger portions thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 28.27  Non-preemption of other requirements.

    Section 3600A's requirement to preserve biological evidence applies 
cumulatively with other evidence retention requirements. It does not 
preempt or supersede any statute, regulation, court order, or other 
provision of law that may require evidence, including biological 
evidence, to be preserved.


<R05>
Sec. 28.28  Sanctions for violations.

    (a) Disciplinary sanctions. Violations of section 3600A or of this 
subpart by Government employees shall be subject to the disciplinary 
sanctions authorized by the rules or policies of their employing 
agencies for violations of statutory or regulatory requirements.
    (b) Criminal sanctions. Violations of section 3600A may also be 
subject to criminal sanctions as prescribed in subsection (f) of that 
section. Section 3600A(f) makes it a felony offense, punishable by up to 
five years of imprisonment, for anyone to knowingly and intentionally 
destroy, alter, or tamper with biological evidence that is required to 
be preserved under section 3600A with the intent to prevent that 
evidence from being subjected to DNA testing or prevent the production 
or use of that evidence in an official proceeding.
    (c) No effect on validity of convictions. Section 3600A's 
requirements are enforceable through the disciplinary sanctions and 
criminal sanctions described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. 
A failure to preserve biological evidence as required by section 3600A 
does not provide a basis for relief in any postconviction proceeding.

<R05>
Sec. 29.8  Motor vehicle owner participation.

    In order to participate in this program, the owner(s) of a motor 
vehicle must sign a program consent form and register with a 
participating State or locality. If the vehicle is registered to more 
than one person, both owners must sign the consent form. By enrolling in 
the federal program, the owner(s) of the motor vehicle--
    (a) State(s) that the vehicle is not normally operated under the 
specified conditions; and
    (b) Agree(s) to:
    (1) Display the program decals or devices on the owner's vehicle;
    (2) Permit law enforcement officials in any State or locality to 
stop the motor vehicle if the vehicle is being operated under the

specified condition(s) even if the officials have no other basis for 
believing the vehicle is being operated unlawfully; and
    (4) Comply with any other regulation(s) or guideline(s) governing 
participation in this program.


<R05>
Sec. 29.9  Motor vehicles for hire.

    (a) Any person who is in the business of renting or leasing motor 
vehicles and who rents or leases a motor vehicle on which a program 
decal or device is affixed shall notify the person to whom the motor 
vehicle is rented or leased about the program, prior to transferring 
possession of the vehicle.
    (b) The notice required by this section shall be printed in bold 
type in the rental or lease agreement, and on the envelope in which the 
rental agreement is placed. The notice provision in the rental or lease 
agreement must utilize a larger font than the standard type in the 
agreement. The notice must state that the motor vehicle may be stopped 
by law enforcement officials if it is operated under the conditions 
specified by the program in which the car is enrolled even if the 
officials have no other basis for believing that the vehicle is being 
operated unlawfully.
    (c) Failure to provide the notice required by this section to a 
renter or lessee may result in the assessment of a civil penalty by the 
Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division, or his or her designee, of 
an amount not to exceed $5,000. No penalty shall be assessed unless the 
person charged has been given notice and an opportunity for a hearing of 
such charge.


<R05>
Sec. 29.10  Owner withdrawal from the program.

    An owner may withdraw from the program at any time by completely 
removing the program decal and changing the license plate if necessary. 
The owner is also encouraged to notify the participating agency in 
writing of such withdrawal.


<R05>
Sec. 29.11  Sale or other transfer of an enrolled vehicle.

    Upon the transferral of ownership of an enrolled vehicle, the 
transferring owner must completely remove the program decals, change the 
license plate(s) if necessary, and is encouraged to notify the 
participating agency in writing of the transfer of ownership of the 
vehicle.


<R05>
Sec. 29.12  Specified conditions under which stops may be authorized.

    A motor vehicle owner may voluntarily enroll his or her vehicle(s) 
and give written consent to law enforcement official to stop the vehicle 
if it is being operated under any or all the conditions set forth in 
this section. For each condition, the owner(s) must grant consent and 
affix a separate decal, device, or license plate.
    (a) Time. A motor vehicle owner may authorize law enforcement 
officers to stop the enrolled vehicle if it is being operated between 
the hours of 1:00 AM and 5:00 AM. By enrolling in a program with this 
condition, the owner must state that the vehicle is not normally 
operated between the specified hours, and that the owner understands 
that the operation of the vehicle between those hours provides 
sufficient grounds for a law enforcement officer to reasonably believe 
that the vehicle is not being operated by or with the consent of the 
owner, even if the law enforcement official has no other basis for 
believing that the vehicle is being operated unlawfully.
    (b) Border crossing or port entry. A motor vehicle owner may 
authorize law enforcement officers to stop the enrolled vehicle if it 
crosses, is about to cross or is about to be transported across a United 
States land border, or if it enters a United States port. For purposes 
of this section, the phrase ``about to cross a United States land 
border'' means the vehicle is operated or transported within one mile of 
a United States land border. Participating States or localities may 
implement this provision in accordance with local conditions, provided 
that a participating State or locality may not extend the applicable 
geographic area beyond one mile from the United States land border. By 
enrolling in a

[[Page 464]]

program with this condition, the owner must state that the vehicle is 
not normally driven across a border or into a port, and that the owner 
understands that the operation or transport of the vehicle within a mile 
of a United States land border or into a port provides sufficient 
grounds for a law enforcement officer to believe that the vehicle is not 
being operated by or with the consent of the owner even if the law 
enforcement officer has no other basis for believing that the vehicle is 
being operated unlawfully.


<R05>
Sec. 29.13  No new conditions without consent.

    After the program has begun, new conditions under which a vehicle 
may be stopped may only be added to an existing program if the owner 
consents to the new condition or conditions.

[[Page 466]]


<R05>
Sec. 30.7  How does the Attorney General communicate with state and local 

officials concerning the Department's programs and activities?

    (a) For those programs and activities covered by a state process 
under Sec. 30.6, the Attorney General, to the extent permitted by law:
    (1) Uses the state process to determine views of state and local 
elected officials; and
    (2) Communicates with state and local elected officials, through the 
state process, as early in a program planning cycle as is reasonably 
feasible to explain specific plans and actions.
    (b) The Attorney General provides notice to directly affected state, 
areawide, regional, and local entities in a state or proposed federal 
financial assistance or direct federal development if:
    (1) The state has not adopted a process under the Order; or
    (2) The assistance or development involves a program or activity not 
selected for the state process.

This notice may be made by publication in the Federal Register or other 
means which the Department in its discretion deems appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 30.8  How does the Attorney General provide an opportunity to comment on 

proposed Federal financial assistance and direct Federal development?

    (a) Except in unusual circumstances, the Attorney General gives 
state processes or directly affected state, areawide, regional, and 
local officials and entities:
    (1) At least 30 days from the date established by the Attorney 
General to comment on proposed federal financial assistance in the form 
of noncompeting continuation awards; and
    (2) At least 60 days from the date established by the Attorney 
General to comment on proposed direct federal development or federal

    (a) The Attorney General follows the procedures in Sec. 30.10 if:
    (1) A state office or official is designated to act as a single 
point of contact between a state process and all federal agencies; and
    (2) That office or official transmits a state process recommendation 
for a program selected under Sec. 30.6.
    (b)(1) The single point of contact is not obligated to transmit 
comments from state, areawide, regional, or local officials and entities 
where there is no state process recommendation.
    (2) If a state process recommendation is transmitted by a single 
point of contact, all comments from state, areawide, regional, and local 
officials and entities that differ from it must also be transmitted.
    (c) If a state has not established a process, or is unable to submit 
a state process recommendation, state, areawide, regional, and local 
officials and entities may submit comments either to the applicant or to 
the Department.
    (d) If a program or activity is not selected for a state process, 
state, areawide, regional, and local officials and entities may submit 
comments either to the applicant or to the Department. In addition, if a 
state process recommendation for a nonselected program or activity is 
transmitted to the Department by the single point of contact, the 
Attorney General follows the procedures of Sec. 30.10 of this part.
    (e) The Attorney General considers comments which do not constitute 
a state process recommendation submitted under these regulations and for 
which the Attorney General is not required to apply the procedures of 
Sec. 30.10 of this part, when such comments are provided by a single 
point of contact, by the applicant, or directly to the Department by a 
commenting party.

[[Page 467]]


<R05>
Sec. 30.10  How does the Attorney General make efforts to accommodate 

intergovernmental concerns?

    (a) If a state process provides a state process recommendation to 
the Department through its single point of contact, the Attorney General 
either:
    (1) Accepts the recommendation;
    (2) Reaches a mutually agreeable solution with the state process; or
    (3) Provides the single point of contact with a written explanation 
of the decision, in such form as the Attorney General in his or her 
discretion deems appropriate. The Attorney General may also supplement 
the written explanation by providing the explanation to the single point 
of contact by telephone, other telecommunication, or other means.
    (b) In any explanation under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the 
Attorney General informs the single point of contact that:
    (1) The Department will not implement its decision for at least ten 
days after the single point of contact receives the explanation; or
    (2) The Attorney General has reviewed the decision and determined 
that, because of unusual circumstances, the waiting period of at least 
ten days is not feasible.
    (c) For purposes of computing the waiting period under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, a single point of contact is presumed to have 
received written notification five days after the date of mailing of 
such notification.


<R05>
Sec. 30.11  What are the Attorney General's obligations in interstate 

situations?

    (a) The Attorney General is responsible for:
    (1) Identifying proposed federal financial assistance and direct 
federal development that have an impact on interstate areas;
    (2) Notifying appropriate officials and entities in states which 
have adopted a process and which select the Department's program or 
activity;
    (3) Making efforts to identify and notify the affected state, 
areawide, regional, and local officials and entities in those states 
that have not adopted a process under the Order or do not select the 
Department's program or activity; and
    (4) Responding pursuant to Sec. 30.10 if the Attorney General 
receives a recommendation from a designated areawide agency transmitted 
by a single point of contact in cases in which the review, coordination, 
and communication with the Department have been delegated.
    (b) The Attorney General uses the procedures in Sec. 30.10 if a 
state process provides a state process recommendation to the Department 
through a single point of contact.


<R05>
Sec. 30.12  How may a state simplify, consolidate, or substitute federally 

required state plans?

    (a) As used in this section:
    (1) Simplify means that a state may develop its own format, choose 
its own submission date, and select the planning period for a state 
plan.
    (2) Consolidate means that a state may meet statutory and regulatory 
requirements by combining two or more plans into one document and that 
the state can select the format, submission date, and planning period 
for the consolidated plan.
    (3) Substitute means that a state may use a plan or other document 
that it has developed for its own purposes to meet federal requirements.
    (b) If not inconsistent with law, a state may decide to try to 
simplify, consolidate, or substitute federally required state plans 
without prior approval by the Attorney General.
    (c) The Attorney General reviews each state plan that a state has 
simplified, consolidated, or substituted and accepts the plan only if 
its contents meet federal requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 30.13  May the Attorney General waive any provision of these 

regulations?

    In an emergency, the Attorney General may waive any provision of 
these regulations.

                        Subpart A_Formula Grants

                           General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 31.1  General.

    This subpart defines eligibility and sets forth requirements for 
application for and administration of formula grants to State 
governments authorized by part B, subpart I, of the Juvenile Justice and 
Delinquency Prevention Act.

[60 FR 28440, May 31, 1995, as amended at 64 FR 19676, Apr. 21, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 31.2  Statutory authority.

    The Statute establishing the Office of Juvenile Justice and 
Delinquency Prevention and giving authority to make grants for juvenile 
justice and delinquency prevention improvement programs is the Juvenile 
Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 
5601 et seq.).


<R05>
Sec. 31.3  Formula grant plan and applications.

    Formula Grant Applications for each Fiscal Year should be submitted 
to OJJDP by August 1st (60 days prior to the beginning of the fiscal 
year) or within 60 days after the States are officially notified of the 
fiscal year formula grant allocations. Beginning with FY 1995 and each 
subsequent fiscal year, all Formula Grant Applications are due no later 
than March 31 of the fiscal year for which the funds are allocated.

                           Eligible Applicants


<R05>
Sec. 31.100  Eligibility.

    All States as defined by section 103(7) of the JJDP Act.


<R05>
Sec. 31.101  Designation of State agency.

    The Chief Executive of each State which chooses to apply for a 
formula grant shall establish or designate a State agency as the sole 
agency for supervising the preparation and administration of the plan. 
The plan must demonstrate compliance with administrative and supervisory 
board membership requirements established by the OJJDP Administrator 
pursuant to section 299 (c) of the JJDP Act. States must have available 
for review a copy of the State law or executive order establishing the 
State agency and its authority.


<R05>
Sec. 31.102  State agency structure.

    The State agency may be a discrete unit of State government or a 
division or other component of an existing State crime commission, 
planning agency or other appropriate unit of

[[Page 469]]

State government. Details of organization and structure are matters of 
State discretion, provided that the agency:
    (a) Is a definable entity in the executive branch with the requisite 
authority to carry out the responsibilities imposed by the JJDP Act;
    (b) Has a supervisory board (i.e., a board of directors, commission, 
committee, council, or other policy board) which has responsibility for 
supervising the preparation and administration of the plan and its 
implementation; and
    (c) Has sufficient staff and staff capability to carry out the 
board's policies and the agency's duties and responsibilities to 
administer the program, develop the plan, process applications, 
administer grants awarded under the plan, monitor and evaluate programs 
and projects, provide administration/support services, and perform such 
accountability functions as are necessary to the administration of 
Federal funds, such as grant close-out and audit of subgrant and 
contract funds. At a minimum, one full-time Juvenile Justice Specialist 
must be assigned to the Formula Grants Program by the State agency. 
Where the State does not currently provide or maintain a full-time 
Juvenile Justice Specialist, the plan must clearly establish and 
document that the program and administrative support staff resources 
currently assigned to the program will temporarily meet the adequate 
staff requirement, and provide an assurance that at least one full-time 
Juvenile Justice Specialist will be assigned to the Formula Grants 
Program by the end of FY 1995 (September 30, 1995).


<R05>
Sec. 31.103  Membership of supervisory board.

    The State advisory group appointed under section 223(a)(3) may 
operate as the supervisory board for the State agency, at the discretion 
of the Governor. Where, however, a State has continuously maintained a 
broad-based law enforcement and criminal justice supervisory board 
(council) meeting all the requirements of section 402(b)(2) of the 
Justice System Improvement Act of 1979, and wishes to maintain such a 
board, such composition shall continue to be acceptable provided that 
the board's membership includes the chairman and at least two additional 
citizen members of the State advisory group. For purposes of this 
requirement a citizen member is defined as any person who is not a full-
time government employee or elected official. Any executive committee of 
such a board must include the same proportion of juvenile justice 
advisory group members as are included in the total board membership. 
Any other proposed supervisory board membership is subject to case by 
case review and approval of the OJJDP Administrator and will require, at 
a minimum, ``balanced representation'' of juvenile justice interests.

                          General Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 31.200  General.

    This subpart sets forth general requirements applicable to formula 
grant recipients under the JJDP Act of 1974, as amended. Applicants must 
assure compliance or submit necessary information on these requirements.

[60 FR 28440, May 31, 1995, as amended at 64 FR 19676, Apr. 21, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 31.201  Audit.

    The State must assure that it adheres to the audit requirements 
enumerated in the ``Financial and Administrative Guide for Grants, Guide 
Manual 7100.1 (current edition). Chapter 8 of the Manual contains a 
comprehensive statement of audit policies and requirements relative to 
grantees and subgrantees.


<R05>
Sec. 31.202  Civil rights.

    (a) To carry out the State's Federal civil rights responsibilities 
the plan must:
    (1) Designate a civil rights contact person who has lead 
responsibility in insuring that all applicable civil rights 
requirements, assurances, and conditions are met and who shall act as 
liaison in all civil rights matters with OJJDP and the OJP Office of 
Civil Rights Compliance (OCRC); and
    (2) Provide the Council's Equal Employment Opportunity Program 
(EEOP), if required to maintain one under 28 CFR 42.301, et seq., where 
the application is for $500,000 or more.

[[Page 470]]

    (b) The application must provide assurance that the State will:
    (1) Require that every applicant required to formulate an EEOP in 
accordance with 28 CFR 42.201 et seq., submit a certification to the 
State that it has a current EEOP on file, which meets the requirement 
therein;
    (2) Require that every criminal or juvenile justice agency applying 
for a grant of $500,000 or more submit a copy of its EEOP (if required 
to maintain one under 28 CFR 42.301, et seq.) to OCRC at the time it 
submits its application to the State;
    (3) Inform the public and subgrantees of affected persons' rights to 
file a complaint of discrimination with OCRC for investigation;
    (4) Cooperate with OCRC during compliance reviews of recipients 
located within the State; and
    (5) Comply, and that its subgrantees and contractors will comply 
with the requirement that, in the event that a Federal or State court or 
administrative agency makes a finding of discrimination of the basis of 
race, color, religion, national origin, or sex (after a due process 
hearing) against a State or a subgrantee or contractor, the affected 
recipient or contractor will forward a copy of the finding to OCRC.


<R05>
Sec. 31.203  Open meetings and public access to records.

    The State must assure that the State agency, its supervisory board 
established pursuant to section 299(c) and the State advisory group 
established pursuant to section 223(a)(3) will follow applicable State 
open meeting and public access laws and regulations in the conduct of 
meetings and the maintenance of records relating to their functions.

                    Juvenile Justice Act Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 31.300  General.

    This subpart sets forth specific JJDP Act requirements for 
application and receipt of formula grants.

[60 FR 28440, May 31, 1995, as amended at 64 FR 19676, Apr. 21, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 31.301  Funding.

    (a) Allocation to States. Funds shall be allocated annually among 
the States on the basis of relative population of persons under age 
eighteen. If the amount allocated for Title II (other than parts D and 
E) of the JJDP Act is less than $75 million, the amount allocated to 
each State will not be less than $325,000, nor more than $400,000, 
provided that no State receives less than its allocation for FY 1992. 
The territories will receive not less than $75,000 or more than 
$100,000. If the amount appropriated for Title II (other than parts D 
and E) is $75 million or more, the amount allocated for each State will 
be not less than $400,000, nor more than $600,000, provided that parts D 
and E have been funded in the full amounts authorized. For the 
Territories, the amount is fixed at $100,000. For each of FY's 1994 and 
1995, the minimum allocation is established at $600,000 for States and 
$100,000 for Territories.
    (b) Funds for local use. At least two-thirds of the formula grant 
application to the state (other than the section 222(d) State Advisory 
Group set aside) must be used for programs by local government, local 
private agencies, and eligible Indian tribes, unless the State applies 
for and is granted a waiver by the OJJDP. The proportion of pass-through 
funds to be made available to eligible Indian tribes shall be based upon 
that proportion of the state youth population under 18 years of age who 
reside in geographical areas where the tribes perform law enforcement 
functions. Pursuant to section 223(a)(5)(C) of the JJDP Act, each of the 
standards set forth in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this 
section must be met in order to establish the eligibility of Indian 
tribes to receive pass through funds:
    (1)(i) The tribal entity must be recognized by the Secretary of the 
Interior as an Indian tribe that performs law enforcement functions as 
defined in paragraph (b) (2) of this section.
    (ii) The tribal entity must agree to attempt to comply with the 
requirements of section 223(a)(12)(A), (13), and (14) of the JJDP Act; 
and
    (iii) The tribal entity must identify the juvenile justice needs to 
be served by these funds within the geographical area where the tribe 
performs law enforcement functions.

[[Page 471]]

    (2) Law enforcement functions are deemed to include those activities 
pertaining to the custody of children, including, but not limited to, 
police efforts to prevent, control, or reduce crime and delinquency or 
to apprehend criminal and delinquent offenders, and/or activities of 
adult and juvenile corrections, probation, or parole authorities.
    (3) To carry out this requirement, OJJDP will annually provide each 
state with the most recent Bureau of Census statistics on the number of 
persons under age 18 living within the state, and the number of persons 
under age 18 who reside in geographical areas where Indian tribes 
perform law enforcement functions.
    (4) Pass-through funds available to tribal entities under section 
223(a)(5)(C) shall be made available within states to Indian tribes, 
combinations of Indian tribes, or to an organization or organizations 
designated by such tribe(s), that meet the standards set forth in 
paragraphs (b)(1)(i)-(iii) of this section. Where the relative number of 
persons under age 18 within a geographic area where an Indian tribe 
performs law enforcement functions is too small to warrant an individual 
subgrant or subgrants, the state may, after consultation with the 
eligible tribe(s), make pass-through funds available to a combination of 
eligible tribes within the state, or to an organization or organizations 
designated by and representing a group of qualifying tribes, or target 
the funds on the larger tribal jurisdictions within the state.
    (5) Consistent with section 223(a)(4) of the JJDP Act, the state 
must provide for consultation with Indian tribes or a combination of 
eligible tribes within the state, or an organization or organizations 
designated by qualifying tribes, in the development of a state plan 
which adequately takes into account the juvenile justice needs and 
requests of those Indian tribes within the state.
    (c) Match. Formula grants under the JJDP Act shall be 100% of 
approved costs, with the exception of planning and administration funds, 
which require a 100 percent cash match (dollar for dollar), and 
construction projects funded under section 299C(a)(2) which also require 
a 100 percent cash match.
    (d) Funds for administration. Not more than ten percent of the total 
annual Formula Grant award may be utilized to develop the annual 
juvenile justice plan and pay for administrative expenses, including 
project monitoring. These funds are to be matched on a dollar for dollar 
basis. The State shall make available needed funds for planning and 
administration to units of local government on an equitable basis. Each 
annual application must identify uses of such funds.
    (e) Nonparticipating States. Pursuant to section 223(d), the OJJDP 
Administrator shall endeavor to make the fund allotment under section 
222(a), of a State which chooses not to participate or loses its 
eligibility to participate in the formula grant program, directly 
available to local public and private nonprofit agencies within the 
nonparticipating State. The funds may be used only for the purpose(s) of 
achieving deinstitutionalization of status offenders and nonoffenders, 
separation of juveniles from incarcerated adults, removal of juveniles 
from adult jails and lockups, and reducing the disproportionate 
confinement of minority youth in secure facilities. Absent a request for 
extension which demonstrates compelling circumstances justifying the 
reallocation of formula grant funds back to the State to which the funds 
were initially allocated, or the proceedings under section 223(d), 
formula grant funds allocated to a State which has failed to submit an 
application, plan, or monitoring data establishing its eligibility for 
the funds will, beginning with FY 1995 be reallocated to the 
nonparticipating State program on September 30 of the fiscal year for 
which the funds were appropriated. Reallocated funds will be 
competitively awarded to eligible recipients pursuant to program 
announcements published in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 31.302  Applicant State agency.

    (a) Pursuant to section 223(a)(1), section 223(a)(2) and section 
299(c) of the JJDP Act, the State must assure that the State agency 
approved under section 299(c) has been designated as the sole agency for 
supervising the preparation and administration of the plan

[[Page 472]]

and has the authority to implement the plan.
    (b) Advisory group. Pursuant to section 223(a)(3) of the JJDP Act, 
the Chief Executive:
    (1) Shall establish an advisory group pursuant to section 223(a)(3) 
of the JJDP Act. The State shall provide a list of all current advisory 
group members, indicating their respective dates of appointment and how 
each member meets the membership requirements specified in this section 
of the Act.
    (2) Should consider, in meeting the statutory membership 
requirements of section 223(A)(3) (A)-(E), appointing at least one 
member who represents each of the following: A locally elected official 
representing general purpose local government; a law enforcement 
officer; representatives of juvenile justice agencies, including a 
juvenile or family court judge, a probation officer, a prosecutor, and a 
person who routinely provides legal representation to youth in juvenile 
court; a public agency representative concerned with delinquency 
prevention and treatment; a representative from a private, non-profit 
organization, such as a parents group, concerned with teenage drug and 
alcohol abuse; a high school principal; a recreation director; a 
volunteer who works with delinquent or at risk youth; a person with a 
special focus on the family; a youth worker experienced with programs 
that offer alternatives to incarceration; persons with special 
competence in addressing programs of school violence and vandalism and 
alternatives to expulsion and suspension; and persons with knowledge 
concerning learning disabilities, child abuse, neglect, and youth 
violence.
    (c) The State shall assure that it complies with the Advisory Group 
financial support requirement of section 222(d) and the composition and 
function requirements of section 223(a)(3) of the JJDP Act.


<R05>
Sec. 31.303  Substantive requirements.

    (a) Assurances. The State must certify through the provision of 
assurances that it has complied and will comply (as appropriate) with 
sections 223(a)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), 
(16), (17), (18), (19), (20), (21), (22), and (25), and sections 229 and 
261(d), in formulating and implementing the State plan. The Formula 
Grant Application kit provides a form and guidance for the provision of 
assurances. OJJDP interprets the section 223(a)(16) assurance as 
satisfied by an affirmation that State law and/or policy clearly require 
equitable treatment on the required bases; or by providing in the State 
plan that the State agency will require an assurance of equitable 
treatment by all Formula Grant subgrant and contract recipients, and 
establish as a program goal, in conjunction with the State Advisory 
Group, the adoption and implementation of a statewide juvenile justice 
policy that all youth in the juvenile justice system will be treated 
equitably without regard to gender, race, family income, and mentally, 
emotionally, or physically handicapping conditions. OJJDP interprets the 
section 223(a)(25) assurance as satisfied by a provision in the State 
plan for the State agency and the State Advisory Group to promulgate 
policies and budget priorities that require the funding of programs that 
are part of a comprehensive and coordinated community system of services 
as set forth in section 103(19) of the JJDP Act. This requirement is 
applicable when a State's formula grant for any fiscal year exceeds 105 
percent of the State's formula grant for FY 1992.
    (b) Serious juvenile offender emphasis. Pursuant to sections 
101(a)(10) and 223(a)(10) of the JJDP Act, OJJDP encourages States that 
have identified serious and violent juvenile offenders as a priority 
problem to allocate formula grant funds to programs designed for serious 
and violent juvenile offenders at a level consistent with the extent of 
the problem as identified through the State planning process. Particular 
attention should be given to improving prosecution, sentencing 
procedures, providing resources necessary for effective rehabilitation, 
and facilitating the coordination of services between the juvenile 
justice and criminal justice systems.
    (c) Deinstitutionalization of status offenders and non-offenders. 
Pursuant to section 223(a)(12)(A) of the JJDP Act, the State shall:

[[Page 473]]

    (1) Describe its plan, procedure, and timetable covering the three-
year planning cycle, for assuring that the requirements of this section 
are met. Refer to Sec. 31.303(f)(3) for the rules related to the valid 
court order exception to this Act requirement.
    (2) Describe the barriers the State faces in achieving full 
compliance with the provisions of this requirement.
    (3) Federal wards. Apply this requirement to alien juveniles under 
Federal jurisdiction who are held in State or local facilities.
    (4) DSO compliance. Those States which, based upon the most recently 
submitted monitoring report, have been found to be in full compliance 
with section 223(a)(12)(A) may, in lieu of addressing paragraphs (c)(1) 
and (2) of this section, provide an assurance that adequate plans and 
resources are available to maintain full compliance.
    (5) Submit the report required under section 223(a)(12)(B) of the 
Act as part of the annual monitoring report required by section 
223(a)(15) of the Act.
    (d) Contact with incarcerated adults. (1) Pursuant to section 
223(a)(13) of the JJDP Act the State shall:
    (i) Separation. Describe its plan and procedure, covering the three-
year planning cycle, for assuring that the requirements of this section 
are met. The term contact includes any physical or sustained sight or 
sound contact between juvenile offenders in a secure custody status and 
incarcerated adults, including inmate trustees. A juvenile offender in a 
secure custody status is one who is physically detained or confined in a 
locked room or other area set aside or used for the specific purpose of 
securely detaining persons who are in law enforcement custody. Secure 
detention or confinement may result either from being placed in such a 
room or area and/or from being physically secured to a cuffing rail or 
other stationary object. Sight contact is defined as clear visual 
contact between incarcerated adults and juveniles within close proximity 
to each other. Sound contact is defined as direct oral communication 
between incarcerated adults and juvenile offenders. Separation must be 
accomplished architecturally or through policies and procedures in all 
secure areas of the facility which include, but are not limited to, such 
areas as admissions, sleeping, and shower and toilet areas. Brief and 
inadvertent or accidental contact between juvenile offenders in a secure 
custody status and incarcerated adults in secure areas of a facility 
that are not dedicated to use by juvenile offenders and which are 
nonresidential, which may include dining, recreational, educational, 
vocational, health care, sally ports or other entry areas, and 
passageways (hallways), would not require a facility or the State to 
document or report such contact as a violation. However, any contact in 
a dedicated juvenile area, including any residential area of a secure 
facility, between juveniles in a secure custody status and incarcerated 
adults would be a reportable violation.
    (ii) In those instances where accused juvenile criminal-type 
offenders are authorized to be temporarily detained in facilities where 
adults are confined, the State must set forth the procedures for 
assuring no sight or sound contact between such juveniles and confined 
adults.
    (iii) Describe the barriers which may hinder the separation of 
alleged or adjudicated criminal type offenders, status offenders and 
non-offenders from incarcerated adults in any particular jail, lockup, 
detention or correctional facility.
    (iv) Those States which, based upon the most recently submitted 
monitoring report, have been found to be in compliance with section 
223(a)(13) may, in lieu of addressing paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (ii), and 
(iii) of this section, provide an assurance that adequate plans and 
resources are available to maintain compliance.
    (v) Assure that adjudicated delinquents are not reclassified 
administratively and transferred to an adult (criminal) correctional 
authority to avoid the intent of separating juveniles from adult 
criminals in jails or correctional facilities. A State is not prohibited 
from placing or transferring an alleged or adjudicated delinquent who 
reaches the State's age of full criminal responsibility to an adult 
facility when required or authorized by State law. However, the 
administrative transfer,

[[Page 474]]

without statutory direction or authorization, of a juvenile offender to 
an adult correctional authority, or a transfer within a mixed juvenile 
and adult facility for placement with adult criminals, either before or 
after a juvenile reaches the age of full criminal responsibility, is 
prohibited. A State is also precluded from transferring adult offenders 
to a juvenile correctional authority for placement in a juvenile 
facility. This neither prohibits nor restricts the waiver or transfer of 
a juvenile to criminal court for prosecution, in accordance with State 
law, for a criminal felony violation, nor the detention or confinement 
of a waived or transferred criminal felony violator in an adult 
facility.
    (2) Implementation. The requirement of this provision is to be 
planned and implemented immediately by each State.
    (e) Removal of juveniles from adult jails and lockups. Pursuant to 
section 223(a)(14)of the JJDP Act, the State shall:
    (1) Describe its plan, procedure, and timetable for assuring that 
requirements of this section will be met beginning after December 8, 
1985. Refer to Sec. 31.303(f)(4) to determine the regulatory exception 
to this requirement.
    (2) Describe the barriers that a State faces in removing all 
juveniles from adult jails and lockups. This requirement excepts only 
those alleged or adjudicated juvenile delinquents placed in a jail or a 
lockup for up to six hours from the time they enter a secure custody 
status or immediately before or after a court appearance, those 
juveniles formally waived or transferred to criminal court and against 
whom criminal felony charges have been filed, or juveniles over whom a 
criminal court has original or concurrent jurisdiction and such court's 
jurisdiction has been invoked through the filing of criminal felony 
charges.
    (3) Collocated facilities. (i) Determine whether or not a facility 
in which juveniles are detained or confined is an adult jail or lockup. 
The JJDP Act prohibits the secure custody of juveniles in adult jails 
and lockups, except as otherwise provided under the Act and implementing 
OJJDP regulations. Juvenile facilities collocated with adult facilities 
are considered adult jails or lockups absent compliance with criteria 
established in paragraphs (e)(3)(i)(C)(1) through (4) of this section.
    (A) A collocated facility is a juvenile facility located in the same 
building as an adult jail or lockup, or is part of a related complex of 
buildings located on the same grounds as an adult jail or lockup. A 
complex of buildings is considered ``related'' when it shares physical 
features such as walls and fences, or services beyond mechanical 
services (heating, air conditioning, water and sewer), or the 
specialized services that are allowable under paragraph (e)(3)(i)(C)(3) 
of this section.
    (B) The State must determine whether a collocated facility qualifies 
as a separate juvenile detention facility under the four criteria set 
forth in paragraphs (e)(3)(i)(C) (1) through (4) of this section for the 
purpose of monitoring compliance with section 223(a) (12)(A), (13) and 
(14) of the JJDP Act.
    (C) Each of the following four criteria must be met in order to 
ensure the requisite separateness of a juvenile detention facility that 
is collocated with an adult jail or lockup:
    (1) Separation between juveniles and adults such that there could be 
no sustained sight or sound contact between juveniles and incarcerated 
adults in the facility. Separation can be achieved architecturally or 
through time-phasing of common use nonresidential areas; and
    (2) Separate juvenile and adult programs, including recreation, 
education, vocation, counseling, dining, sleeping, and general living 
activities. There must be an independent and comprehensive operational 
plan for the juvenile detention facility which provides for a full range 
of separate program services. No program activities may be shared by 
juveniles and incarcerated adults. Time-phasing of common use 
nonresidential areas is permissible to conduct program activities. 
Equipment and other resources may be used by both populations subject to 
security concerns; and
    (3) Separate staff for the juvenile and adult populations, including 
management, security, and direct care staff. Staff providing specialized 
services

[[Page 475]]

(medical care, food service, laundry, maintenance and engineering, etc.) 
who are not normally in contact with detainees, or whose infrequent 
contacts occur under conditions of separation of juveniles and adults, 
can serve both populations (subject to State standards or licensing 
requirements). The day to day management, security and direct care 
functions of the juvenile detention center must be vested in a totally 
separate staff, dedicated solely to the juvenile population within the 
collocated facilities; and
    (4) In States that have established standards or licensing 
requirements for juvenile detention facilities, the juvenile facility 
must meet the standards (on the same basis as a free-standing juvenile 
detention center) and be licensed as appropriate. If there are no State 
standards or licensing requirements, OJJDP encourages States to 
establish administrative requirements that authorize the State to review 
the facility's physical plant, staffing patterns, and programs in order 
to approve the collocated facility based on prevailing national juvenile 
detention standards.
    (ii) The State must determine that the four criteria are fully met. 
It is incumbent upon the State to make the determination through an on-
site facility (or full construction and operations plan) review and, 
through the exercise of its oversight responsibility, to ensure that the 
separate character of the juvenile detention facility is maintained by 
continuing to fully meet the four criteria set forth in paragraphs 
(e)(3)(i)(C) (1) through (4) of this section.
    (iii) Collocated juvenile detention facilities approved by the State 
and concurred with by OJJDP before December 10, 1996 may be reviewed by 
the State against the regulatory criteria and OJJDP policies in effect 
at the time of the initial approval and concurrence or against the 
regulatory criteria set forth herein, as the State determines. 
Facilities approved on or after the effective date of this regulation 
shall be reviewed against the regulatory criteria set forth herein. All 
collocated facilities are subject to the separate staff requirement 
established by the 1992 Amendments to the JJDP Act, and set forth in 
paragraph (e)(3)(i)(C)(3) of this section.
    (iv) An annual on-site review of the facility must be conducted by 
the compliance monitoring staff person(s) representing or employed by 
the State agency administering the JJDP Act Formula Grants Program. The 
purpose of the annual review is to determine if compliance with the 
criteria set forth in paragraphs (e)(3)(i)(C) (1) through (4) of this 
section is being maintained.
    (4) Those States which, based upon the most recently submitted 
monitoring report, have been found to be in full compliance with section 
223(a)(14) may, in lieu of addressing paragraphs (e) (1) and (2) of this 
section, provide an assurance that adequate plans and resources are 
available to maintain full compliance.
    (f) Monitoring of jails, detention facilities and correctional 
facilities. (1) Pursuant to section 223(a)(15) of the JJDP Act, and 
except as provided by paragraph (f)(7) of this section, the State shall:
    (i) Describe its plan, procedure, and timetable for annually 
monitoring jails, lockups, detention facilities, correctional facilities 
and non-secure facilities. The plan must at a minimum describe in detail 
each of the following tasks including the identification of the specific 
agency(s) responsible for each task.
    (A) Identification of monitoring universe: This refers to the 
identification of all residential facilities which might hold juveniles 
pursuant to public authority and thus must be classified to determine if 
it should be included in the monitoring effort. This includes those 
facilities owned or operated by public and private agencies.
    (B) Classification of the monitoring universe: This is the 
classification of all facilities to determine which ones should be 
considered as a secure detention or correctional facility, adult 
correctional institution, jail, lockup, or other type of secure or 
nonsecure facility.
    (C) Inspection of facilities: Inspection of facilities is necessary 
to ensure an accurate assessment of each facility's classification and 
record keeping. The inspection must include:

[[Page 476]]

    (1) A review of the physical accommodations to determine whether it 
is a secure or non-secure facility or whether adequate sight and sound 
separation between juvenile and adult offenders exists and
    (2) A review of the record keeping system to determine whether 
sufficient data are maintained to determine compliance with section 
223(a) (12), (13) and/or (14).
    (D) Data collection and data verification: This is the actual 
collection and reporting of data to determine whether the facility is in 
compliance with the applicable requirement(s) of section 223(a) (12), 
(13) and/or (14). The length of the reporting period should be 12 months 
of data, but in no case less than 6 months. If the data is self-reported 
by the facility or is collected and reported by an agency other than the 
State agency designated pursuant to section 223(a)(1) of the JJDP Act, 
the plan must describe a statistically valid procedure used to verify 
the reported data.
    (ii) Provide a description of the barriers which the State faces in 
implementing and maintaining a monitoring system to report the level of 
compliance with section 223(a) (12), (13), and (14) and how it plans to 
overcome such barriers.
    (iii) Describe procedures established for receiving, investigating, 
and reporting complaints of violation of section 223(a) (12), (13), and 
(14). This should include both legislative and administrative procedures 
and sanctions.
    (2) For the purpose of monitoring for compliance with section 
223(a)(12)(A) of the Act, a secure detention or correctional facility is 
any secure public or private facility used for the lawful custody of 
accused or adjudicated juvenile offenders or nonoffenders, or used for 
the lawful custody of accused or convicted adult criminal offenders. 
Accused status offenders or nonoffenders in lawful custody can be held 
in a secure juvenile detention facility for up to twenty-four hours, 
exclusive of weekends and holidays, prior to an initial court appearance 
and for an additional twenty-four hours, exclusive of weekends and 
holidays, following an initial court appearance.
    (3) Valid court order. For the purpose of determining whether a 
valid court order exists and a juvenile has been found to be in 
violation of that valid order all of the following conditions must be 
present prior to secure incarceration:
    (i) The juvenile must have been brought into a court of competent 
jurisdiction and made subject to an order issued pursuant to proper 
authority. The order must be one which regulates future conduct of the 
juvenile. Prior to issuance of the order, the juvenile must have 
received the full due process rights guaranteed by the Constitution of 
the United States.
    (ii) The court must have entered a judgment and/or remedy in accord 
with established legal principles based on the facts after a hearing 
which observes proper procedures.
    (iii) The juvenile in question must have received adequate and fair 
warning of the consequences of violation of the order at the time it was 
issued and such warning must be provided to the juvenile and to the 
juvenile's attorney and/or legal guardian in writing and be reflected In 
the court record and proceedings.
    (iv) All judicial proceedings related to an alleged violation of a 
valid court order must be held before a court of competent jurisdiction. 
A juvenile accused of violating a valid court order may be held in 
secure detention beyond the 24-hour grace period permitted for a 
noncriminal juvenile offender under OJJDP monitoring policy, for 
protective purposes as prescribed by State law, or to assure the 
juvenile's appearance at the violation hearing, as provided by State 
law, if there has been a judicial determination based on a hearing 
during the 24-hour grace period that there is probable cause to believe 
the juvenile violated the court order. In such case the juveniles may be 
held pending a violation hearing for such period of time as is provided 
by State law, but in no event should detention prior to a violation 
hearing exceed 72 hours exclusive of nonjudicial days. A juvenile 
alleged or found in a violation hearing to have violated a Valid Court 
Order may be held only in a secure juvenile detention or correctional 
facility, and not in an adult jail or lockup.

[[Page 477]]

    (v) Prior to and during the violation hearing the following full due 
process rights must be provided:
    (A) The right to have the charges against the juvenile in writing 
served upon him a reasonable time before the hearing;
    (B) The right to a hearing before a court;
    (C) The right to an explanation of the nature and consequences of 
the proceeding;
    (D) The right to legal counsel, and the right to have such counsel 
appointed by the court if indigent;
    (E) The right to confront witnesses;
    (F) The right to present witnesses;
    (G) The right to have a transcript or record of the proceedings; and
    (H) The right of appeal to an appropriate court.
    (vi) In entering any order that directs or authorizes the placement 
of a status offender in a secure facility, the judge presiding over an 
initial probable cause hearing or violation hearing must determine that 
all the elements of a valid court order (paragraphs (f)(3) (i), (ii) and 
(iii) of this section) and the applicable due process rights (paragraph 
(f)(3)(v) of this section) were afforded the juvenile and, in the case 
of a violation hearing, the judge must obtain and review a written 
report that: reviews the behavior of the juvenile and the circumstances 
under which the juvenile was brought before the court and made subject 
to such order; determines the reasons for the juvenile's behavior; and 
determines whether all dispositions other than secure confinement have 
been exhausted or are clearly inappropriate. This report must be 
prepared and submitted by an appropriate public agency (other than a 
court or law enforcement agency).
    (vii) A non-offender such as a dependent or neglected child cannot 
be placed in secure detention or correctional facilities for violating a 
valid court order.
    (4) Removal exception (section 223(a)(14)). The following conditions 
must be met in order for an accused juvenile criminal-type offender, 
awaiting an initial court appearance, to be detained up to 24 hours 
(excluding weekends and holidays) in an adult jail or lockup:
    (i) The State must have an enforceable State law requiring an 
initial court appearance within 24 hours after being taken into custody 
(excluding weekends and holidays);
    (ii) The geographic area having jurisdiction over the juvenile is 
outside a metropolitan statistical area pursuant to the Bureau of 
Census' current designation;
    (iii) A determination must be made that there is no existing 
acceptable alternative placement for the juvenile pursuant to criteria 
developed by the State and approved by OJJDP;
    (iv) The adult jail or lockup must have been certified by the State 
to provide for the sight and sound separation of juveniles and 
incarcerated adults;
    (v) The State must provide documentation that the conditions in 
paragraphs(f)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section have been met and 
received prior approval from OJJDP. OJJDP strongly recommends that jails 
and lockups that incarcerate juveniles be required to provide youth 
specific admissions screening and continuous visual supervision of 
juveniles incarcerated pursuant to this exception; and
    (vi) Pursuant to section 223(a)(14) of the JJDP Act, the nonMSA (low 
population density) exception to the jail and lockup removal requirement 
as described in paragraphs (f)(4) (i) through (v) of this section shall 
remain in effect through 1997, and shall allow for secure custody beyond 
the twenty-four hour period described in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this 
section when the facility is located where conditions of distance to be 
traveled or the lack of highway, road, or other ground transportation do 
not allow for court appearances within twenty-four hours, so that a 
brief (not to exceed an additional forty-eight hours) delay is 
excusable; or the facility is located where conditions of safety exist 
(such as severely adverse, life-threatening weather conditions that do 
not allow for reasonably safe travel), in which case the time for an 
appearance may be delayed until twenty-four hours after the time that 
such conditions allow for reasonably safe travel.

[[Page 478]]

States may use these additional statutory allowances only where the 
precedent requirements set forth in paragraphs (f)(4) (i) through (v) of 
this section have been complied with. This may necessitate statutory or 
judicial (court rule or opinion) relief within the State from the 
twenty-four hour initial court appearance standard required by paragraph 
(f)(4)(i) of this section.
    (5) Reporting requirement. The State shall report annually to the 
Administrator of OJJDP on the results of monitoring for section 
223(a)(12),(13), and (14) of the JJDP Act. The reporting period should 
provide 12 months of data, but shall not be less than six months. The 
report shall be submitted to the Administrator of OJJDP by December 31 
of each year.
    (i) To demonstrate the extent of compliance with section 
223(a)(12)(A) of the JJDP Act, the report must include, at a minimum,

similar State law. A juvenile who violates this statute, or a similar 
state law, is excepted from the deinstitutionalization of status 
offenders requirement;
    (D) The total number of accused status offenders (including valid 
court order violators, out of state runaways, and Federal wards, but

    (6) Compliance. The State must demonstrate the extent to which the 
requirements of sections 223(a)(12)(A), (13), (14), and (23) of the Act 
are met. If the State fails to demonstrate full compliance with sections 
223(a)(12)(A) and (14), and compliance with sections 223(a)(13) and (23) 
by the end of the fiscal year for any fiscal year beginning with fiscal 
year 1994, the State's allotment under section 222 will be reduced by 
twenty five percent for each such failure, provided that the State will 
lose its eligibility for any allotment unless: the State agrees to 
expend all remaining funds (except planning and administration, State 
advisory group set-aside funds and Indian tribe pass-through funds) for 
the purpose of

[[Page 480]]

achieving compliance with the mandate(s) for which the State is in 
noncompliance; or the Administrator makes discretionary determination 
that the State has substantially complied with the mandate(s) for which 
there is noncompliance and that the State has made through appropriate 
executive or legislative action, an unequivocal commitment to achieving 
full compliance within a reasonable time. In order for a determination 
to be made that a State has substantially complied with the mandate(s), 
the State must demonstrate that it has: Diligently carried out the plan 
approved by OJJDP; demonstrated significant progress toward full 
compliance; submitted a plan based on an assessment of current barriers 
to DMC; and provided an assurance that added resources will be expended, 
be it formula grants or other funds, to achieve compliance. Where a 
State's allocation is reduced, the amount available for planning and 
administration and the required pass-through allocation, other than 
State advisory group set-aside, will be reduced because they are based 
on the reduced allocation.
    (i) Full compliance with section 223(a)(12)(A) is achieved when a 
State has removed 100 percent of status offenders and nonoffenders from 
secure detention and correctional facilities or can demonstrate full 
compliance with de minimis exceptions pursuant to the policy criteria 
contained in the Federal Register of January 9, 1981 (copies are 
available from the Office of General Counsel, Office of Justice 
Programs, 633 Indiana Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20531).
    (ii) Compliance with section 223(a)(13) has been achieved when a 
State can demonstrate that:
    (A) The last submitted monitoring report, covering a full 12 months 
of data, demonstrates that no juveniles were incarcerated in 
circumstances that were in violation of section 223(a)(13); or
    (B)(1) The instances of noncompliance reported in the last submitted 
monthly report do not indicate a pattern or practice but rather 
constitute isolated instances; and
    (2)(i) Where all instances of noncompliance reported were in 
violation of or departure from State law, rule, or policy that clearly 
prohibits the incarceration of all juvenile offenders in circumstances 
that would be in violation of section 223(a)(13), existing enforcement 
mechanisms are such that the instances of noncompliance are unlikely to 
recur in the future; or
    (ii) An acceptable plan has been developed to eliminate the 
noncompliant incidents.
    (iii)(A) Full compliance is achieved when a state demonstrates that 
the last submitted monitoring report, covering 12 months of actual data, 
demonstrates that no juveniles were held in adult jails or lockups in 
circumstances that were in violation of section 223(a)(14).
    (B) Full compliance with de minimis exceptions is achieved when a 
State demonstrates that it has met the standard set forth in either of 
paragraphs (f)(6)(iii)(B) (1) or (2) of this section:
    (1) Substantive de minimis standard. To comply with this standard 
the State must demonstrate that each of the following requirements have 
been met:
    (i) State law, court rule, or other statewide executive or judicial 
policy clearly prohibits the detention or confinement of all juveniles 
in circumstances that would be in violation of section 223(a)(14);
    (ii) All instances of noncompliance reported in the last submitted 
monitoring reported were in violation of or departures from, the State 
law, rule, or policy referred to in paragraph (f)(6)(iii)(B)(1)(i) of 
this section;
    (iii) The instances of noncompliance do not indicate a pattern or 
practice but rather constitute isolated instances;
    (iv) Existing mechanisms for the enforcement of the State law, rule 
or policy referred to in paragraph (f)(6)(iii)(B)(1)(i) of this section 
are such that the instances of noncompliance are unlikely to recur in 
the future; and
    (v) An acceptable plan has been developed to eliminate the 
noncompliant incidents and to monitor the existing mechanism referred to 
in paragraph (f)(6)(iii)(B)(1)(iv) of this section.
    (2) Numerical de minimis standard. To comply with this standard the 
State

[[Page 481]]

must demonstrate that each of the following requirements under 
paragraphs (f)(6)(iii)(B)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section have been met:
    (i) The incidents of noncompliance reported in the State's last 
submitted monitoring report do not exceed an annual rate of 9 per 
100,000 juvenile population of the State; and
    (ii) An acceptable plan has been developed to eliminate the 
noncompliant incidents through the enactment or enforcement of State 
law, rule, or statewide executive or judicial policy, education, the 
provision of alternatives, or other effective means.
    (iii) Exception. When the annual rate for a State exceeds 9 
incidents of noncompliance per 100,000 juvenile population, the State 
will be considered ineligible for a finding of full compliance with de 
minimis exceptions under the numerical de minimis standard unless the 
State has recently enacted changes in State law which have gone into 
effect and which the State demonstrates can reasonably be expected to 
have a substantial, significant and positive impact on the state's 
achieving full (100%) compliance or full compliance with de minimis 
exceptions by the end of the monitoring period immediately following the 
monitoring period under consideration.
    (iv) Progress. Beginning with the monitoring report due by December 
31, 1990, any State whose prior full compliance status is based on 
having met the numerical de minimis standard set forth in paragraph 
(f)(6)(iii)(B)(2)(i) of this Sec. 31.303, must annually demonstrate, in 
its request for a finding of full compliance with de minimis exceptions, 
continued and meaningful progress toward achieving full (100%) 
compliance in order to maintain eligibility for a continued finding of 
full compliance with de minimis exceptions.
    (v) Request submission. Determinations of full compliance and full 
compliance with de minimis exceptions are made annually by OJJDP 
following submission of the monitoring report due by December 31 of each 
calendar year. Any State reporting less than full (100%) compliance in 
any annual monitoring report may request a finding of full compliance 
with de minimis exceptions under paragraph (f)(6)(iii)(B) (1) or (2) of 
this section. The request may be submitted in conjunction with the 
monitoring report, as soon thereafter as all information required for a 
determination is available, or be included in the annual State plan and 
application for the State's formula grant award.
    (C) Waiver. Failure to achieve full compliance as defined in this 
section shall terminate any State's eligibility for FY 1993 and prior 
year formula grant funds unless the Administrator of OJJDP waives 
termination of the State's eligibility. ln order to be eligible for this 
waiver of termination, a State must request a waiver and demonstrate 
that it meets the standards set forth in paragraphs (f)(6)(iii)(C) (1)-
(7) of this section:
    (1) Agrees to expend all of its formula grant award except planning 
and administration, advisory group set-aside, and Indian tribe pass-
through funds, to achieve compliance with section 223(a)(14); and
    (2) Removed all status and nonoffender juveniles from adult jails 
and lockups. Compliance with this standard requires that the last 
submitted monitoring report demonstrate that no status offender 
(including those accused of or adjudicated for violating a valid court 
order) or nonoffender juveniles were securely detained in adult jails or 
lock-ups for any length of time; or that all status offenders and 
nonoffenders securely detained in adult jails and lock-ups for any 
length of time were held in violation of an enforceable State law and 
did not constitute a pattern or practice within the State; and
    (3) Made meaningful progress in removing juvenile criminal-type 
offenders from adult jails and lockups. Compliance with this standard 
requires the State to document a significant reduction in the number of 
jurisdictions securely detaining juvenile criminal-type offenders in 
violation of section 223 (a)(14) of the JJDP Act; or a significant 
reduction in the number of facilities securely detaining such juveniles; 
or a significant reduction in the average length of time each juvenile 
criminal-type offender is securely detained in an adult jail or lock-up; 
or State legislation has recently been enacted and taken effect and 
which the State demonstrates will significantly impact the

[[Page 482]]

secure detention of juvenile criminal-type offenders in adult jails and 
lock-ups; and
    (4) Diligently carried out the State's jail and lockup removal plan 
approved by OJJDP. Compliance with this standard requires that actions 
have been undertaken to achieve the State's jail and lock-up removal 
goals and objectives within approved time lines, and that the State 
Advisory Group, required by section 223 (a)(3) of the JJDP Act, has 
maintained an appropriate involvement in developing and/or implementing 
the State's plan; and
    (5) Submitted an acceptable plan, based on an assessment of current 
jail and lockup removal barriers within the State, to eliminate 
noncompliant incidents; and
    (6) Achieved compliance with section 223(a)(15) of the JJDP Act; and
    (7) Demonstrates an unequivocal commitment, through appropriate 
executive or legislative action, to achieving full compliance.
    (D) Waiver maximum. A State may receive a waiver of termination of 
eligibility from the Administrator under paragraph (f)(6)(iii)(C) of 
this section for a combined maximum of four Formula Grant Awards through 
Fiscal Year 1993. No additional waivers will be granted.
    (7) Monitoring report exemption. States which have been determined 
by the OJJDP Administrator to have achieved full compliance with 
sections 223(a)(12)(A), (a)(14), and compliance with section 223(a)(13) 
of the JJDP and wish to be exempted from the annual monitoring report 
requirements must submit a written request to the OJJDP Administrator 
which demonstrates that:
    (i) The State provides for an adequate system of monitoring jails, 
law enforcement lockup, detention facilities, to enable an annual 
determination of State compliance with sections 223(a)(12)(A), (13), and 
(14) of the JJDP Act;
    (ii) State legislation has been enacted which conforms to the 
requirements of Sections 223(a)(12)(A), (13), and (14) of the JJDP Act; 
and
    (iii) The enforcement of the legislation is statutorily or 
administratively prescribed, specifically providing that:
    (A) Authority for enforcement of the statute is assigned;
    (B) Time frames for monitoring compliance with the statute are 
specified; and
    (C) Adequate procedures are set forth for enforcement of the statute 
and the imposition of sanctions for violations.
    (g) Juvenile crime analysis. Pursuant to section 223(a)(8), the 
State must conduct an analysis of juvenile crime problems, including 
juvenile gangs that commit crimes, and juvenile justice and delinquency 
prevention needs within the State, including those geographical areas in 
which an Indian tribe performs law enforcement functions. The analysis 
and needs assessment must include educational needs, gender specific 
services, delinquency prevention and treatment services in rural areas, 
and mental health services available to juveniles in the juvenile 
justice system. The analysis should discuss barriers to accessing 
services and provide a plan to provide such services where needed.
    (1) Analysis. The analysis must be provided in the multiyear 
application. A suggested format for the analysis is provided in the 
Formula Grant Application Kit.
    (2) Product. The product of the analysis is a series of brief 
written problem statements set forth in the application that define and 
describe the priority problems.
    (3) Programs. Applications are to include descriptions of programs 
to be supported with JJDP Act formula grant funds. A suggested format 
for these programs is included in the application kit.
    (4) Performance indicators. A list of performance indicators must be 
developed and set forth for each program. These indicators show what 
data will be collected at the program level to measure whether 
objectives and performance goals have been achieved and should relate to 
the measures used in the problem statement and statement of program 
objectives.
    (h) Annual performance report. Pursuant to section 223(a) and 
section 223(a)(22) the State plan shall provide for submission of an 
annual performance report. The State shall report on its progress in the 
implementation of

[[Page 483]]

the approved programs, described in the three-year plan. The performance 
indicators will serve as the objective criteria for a meaningful 
assessment of progress toward achievement of measurable goals. The 
annual performance report shall describe progress made in addressing the 
problem of serious juvenile crime, as documented in the juvenile crime 
analysis pursuant to section 223(a)(8)(A). The annual performance report 
must be submitted to OJJDP no later than June 30 and address all formula 
grant activities carried out during the previous complete calendar year, 
federal fiscal year, or State fiscal year for which information is 
available, regardless of which year's formula grant funds were used to 
support the activities being reported on, e.g., during a reporting 
period, activities may have been funded from two or more formula grant 
awards.
    (i) Technical assistance. States shall include, within their plan, a 
description of technical assistance needs. Specific direction regarding 
the development and inclusion of all technical assistance needs and 
priorities will be provided in the ``Application Kit for Formula Grants 
under the JJDPA.''
    (j) Minority detention and confinement. Pursuant to section 
223(a)(23) of the JJDP Act, States must demonstrate specific efforts to 
reduce the proportion of juveniles detained or confined in secure 
detention facilities, secure correctional facilities, jails and lockups 
who are members of minority groups if such proportion exceeds the 
proportion such groups represent in the general population, viz., in 
most States, youth between ages ten-seventeen are subject to secure 
custody. It is essential that States approach this statutory mandate in 
a comprehensive manner. The purpose of the statute and the regulation in 
this part is to encourage States to address, programmatically, any 
features of its justice system, and related laws and policies, that may 
account for the disproportionate detention or confinement of minority 
juveniles in secure detention facilities, secure correctional 
facilities, jails, and lockups. The disproportionate minority 
confinement core requirement neither establishes nor requires numerical 
standards or quotas in order for a State to achieve or maintain 
compliance. Compliance with this provision is achieved when a State 
meets the requirements set forth in paragraphs (j)(1) through (3) of 
this section:
    (1) Identification. Provide quantifiable documentation (State, 
county and local level) in the State's FY 1994 Formula Grant Plan (and 
all subsequent Multi-Year Plans) Juvenile Crime Analysis and Needs 
Assessment to determine whether minority juveniles are 
disproportionately detained or confined in secure detention and 
correctional facilities, jails and lockups in relation to their 
proportion of the State juvenile population. Guidelines are provided in 
the OJJDP Disproportionate Minority Confinement Technical Assistance 
Manual (see Phase I Matrix). Where quantifiable documentation is not 
available to determine if disproportionate minority confinement exists 
in secure detention and correctional facilities, jails and lockups, the 
State must provide a time-limited plan of action, not to exceed six 
months, for developing and implementing a system for the ongoing 
collection, analysis and dissemination of information regarding 
minorities for those facilities where documentation does not exist.
    (2) Assessment. Each State's FY 1994 Formula Grant Plan must provide 
a completed assessment of disproportionate minority confinement. 
Assessments must, at minimum, identify and explain differences in 
arrest, diversion and adjudication rates, court dispositions other than 
incarceration, the rates and periods of prehearing detention in and 
dispositional commitments to secure facilities of minority youth in the 
juvenile justice system, and transfers to adult court (see Phase II 
Matrix). If a completed assessment is not available, the State must 
submit a time-limited plan (not to exceed twelve months from submission 
of the Formula Grant Application) for completing the assessment.
    (3) Intervention. Each State's FY 1995 Formula Grant Plan must, 
where disproportionate confinement has been demonstrated, provide a 
time-limited plan of action for reducing the disproportionate 
confinement of minority

[[Page 484]]

juveniles in secure facilities. The intervention plan shall be based on 
the results of the assessment, and must include, but not be limited to 
the following:
    (i) Diversion. Increasing the availability and improving the quality 
of diversion programs for minorities who come in contact with the 
juvenile justice system, such as police diversion programs;
    (ii) Prevention. Providing developmental, operational, and 
assessment assistance (financial and/or technical) for prevention 
programs in communities with a high percentage of minority residents 
with emphasis upon support for community-based organizations (including 
non-traditional organizations) that serve minority youth;
    (iii) Reintegration. Providing developmental, operational, and 
assessment assistance (financial and/or technical) for programs designed 
to reduce recidivism by facilitating the reintegration of minority youth 
in the community following release from dispositional commitments to 
reduce recidivism;
    (iv) Policies and procedures. Providing financial and/or technical 
assistance that addresses necessary changes in statewide and local, 
executive, judicial, and legal representation policies and procedures; 
and
    (v) Staffing and training. Providing financial and/or technical 
assistance that addresses staffing and training needs that will 
positively impact the disproportionate confinement of minority youth in 
secure facilities.
    (4) The time-limited plans of action set forth in paragraphs (j) 
(1), (2) and (3) of this section must include a clear indication of 
current and future barriers; which agencies, organizations, or 
individual(s) will be responsible for taking what specific actions; 
when; and what the anticipated outcomes are. The interim and final 
outcomes from implementation of the time-limited plan of action must be 
reported in each State's Multi-Year Plans and Annual Plan Updates. Final 
outcomes for individual project awards are to be included with each 
State's annual performance report (See paragraph (h) of this section).
    (5) Technical assistance is available through the OJJDP Technical 
Assistance Contract to help guide States with the data collection and 
analysis, and with programmatic elements of this requirement. 
Information from the OJJDP Special Emphasis Initiative on 
Disproportionate Minority Confinement pilot sites will be disseminated 
as it becomes available.
    (6) For purposes of this statutory mandate, minority populations are 
defined as: African-Americans, American Indians, Asians, Pacific 
Islanders, and Hispanics.
    (k) Pursuant to section 223(a)(24) of the JJDP Act, states shall 
agree to other terms and conditions as the Administrator may reasonably 
prescribe to assure the effectiveness of programs assisted under the 
Formula Grant.

<R05>
Sec. 31.502  Assurances and plan information.

    (a) In its application for a Juvenile Accountability Incentive Block 
Grant (JAIBG), each State must provide assurances to the Office of 
Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), absent a waiver as 
provided in the JAIBG Program Guidance Manual, that:
    (1) The State will subgrant at least 75% of the State's allocation 
of funds to eligible units of local government to implement authorized 
programs at the local level; and
    (2) The State, and each unit of local government applying for a 
subgrant from the State, will expend not less than 45% of any grant

government certifies to the State, that the interests of public safety 
and juvenile crime control would be better served by expending the grant 
award for purposes set forth in the twelve program areas in a different 
ratio. Such certification shall provide information concerning the 
availability of existing structures or initiatives within the intended 
areas of expenditure (or the availability of alternative funding sources 
for those areas), and the reasons for the State or unit of local 
government's alternative use.
    (3) The funds provided under this part shall be administered in 
compliance with the standards set forth in part 38 (Equal Treatment for 
Faith-based Organizations) of this chapter.
    (b) Following award of JAIBG funds to a State by OJJDP, but prior to

<R05>
Sec. 31.503  Notice of proposed use of funds.

    The mechanism for a State to report on the proposed use of funds by 
the State or by a subgrantee unit of local government is by electronic 
submission of a ``Follow Up Information Form'' to be provided to each 
participating State. The purpose of this report is for the State to 
provide assurances to OJJDP that funds expended by the State and its 
subgrantee units of local government will be used for authorized program 
purpose areas. Although no actual program descriptions will be required, 
information about the distribution of funds among the authorized program 
purpose areas must be provided. Upon receipt and review of the ``Follow 
Up Information Form'' by OJJDP, States may obligate program funds 
retained for expenditure at the State level. Similarly, the State shall 
require that each recipient unit of local government submit its proposed 
use of non-administrative funds to the State prior to drawdown of 
subgrant funds to implement local programs and projects. Upon receipt 
and review of the local unit of government's proposed fund use, the 
State shall authorize the local unit of government to obligate local 
subgrant funds. The State shall electronically submit a copy of the 
local subgrant information to OJJDP, as provided in the award package, 
within 30 days of the date that the local unit of government is 
authorized to obligate program funds under its subgrant award.

    All states are eligible to apply for and receive block grants. 
Section 404 of the Act. State, as defined in the statute, means any 
state of the United States and includes the District of Columbia, the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Section 901(a)(2) 
of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 33.11  Units of local government.

    (a) Units of local government are eligible to receive subgrants from 
a participating state. Unit of local government means any city, county, 
township, borough, parish, village, or other general purpose political 
subdivision of a state and includes Indian tribes which perform law 
enforcement functions as determined by the Secretary of the Interior.

    (b) If the Bureau determines, during any fiscal year, that a portion 
of the funds allocated to a state will not be required, or that a state 
will be unable to qualify and receive funds, or that a state chooses not 
to participate in the program, then the Bureau shall award the funds 
allocated to the state directly to urban, rural, and suburban units of 
local government or combinations thereof within the state, giving 
priority to those jurisdictions with the greatest need. Section 407(d) 
of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 33.12  Establishment of State Office.

    (a) Section 408(a) of the Act provides that the chief executive of

    Section 407(a) of the Justice Assistance Act provides that 80 
percent of the total amount appropriated for part D (block grants) and 
part E (discretionary grants) shall be allocated for block grants.
    (a) Allocation to States. Each participating state shall receive a 
base amount of $250,000 with the remaining funds allocated to each state 
on the basis of the state's relative share of total U.S. population. 
Section 407(a) of the Act. If a state does not elect to participate in 
the Act, the states allocation shall be awarded by the Bureau directly 
to local units of government and

[[Page 514]]

combinations of units of local government within the state. Section 
407(d) of the Act.
    (b) Allocation of funds within the State. (1) Funds granted to the 
state are further subgranted by the state to state agencies and units of 
local government to carry out programs and projects contained in an 
approved application. Each state shall distribute to its local units of 
government, in the aggregate, a portion of the state's block grant funds 
equal to the local government share of total state and local criminal 
justice expenditures. Section 407(b) of the Act. In determining the 
portion to be distributed to local units, the most recent and complete 
data available from the Bureau of Justice Statistics of the U.S. 
Department of Justice shall be used unless the use of other data has 
been approved in advance by the Bureau of Justice Assistance.
    (2) To request approval of a distribution ratio other than that 
based on data of the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the head of the State 
Office must certify in writing to the Bureau of Justice Assistance that 
the ratio it proposes is a correct reflection of the local share of 
total state and local criminal justice expenditures and that the state 
has notified its major local governments of the request and informed 
them of the opportunity to contact the Bureau within 30 days, if they 
have any objections. The written request must also cite the expenditure 
data used to substantiate the proposed change.
    (c) Allocation based on greatest need. In distributing funds among 
urban, rural, and suburban units of local government, the state shall 
give priority to those jurisdictions with the greatest need. Section 
407(b)(2) of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 33.21  Match.

    (a) Funds may be used to pay up to 50 percent of the cost of a 
program or project. Section 403(b)(1) of the Act. The remaining non-
Federal share shall be in cash. Section 403(b)(2) of the Act. Match will 
be provided on a project by project basis. However, states may request 
the Bureau to approve exceptions such as match on a program by program 
basis, state-wide basis, unit-of-government basis, or a combination of 
the above. States must include any requests for approval of other than 
project-by-project match in their applications to the Bureau.
    (b) Funds subgranted to an Indian tribe which performs law 
enforcement functions (as determined by the Secretary of the Interior) 
shall be used to pay 100 percent of the cost of a program or project.

notwithstanding any other provision of law, title to all expendable and 
nonexpendable personal property purchased with funds made available 
under this title, including property with funds made available under 
this title as in effect before the effective date of the Justice 
Assistance Act of 1984, shall vest in the criminal justice agency or 
nonprofit organization that purchased the property if it certifies to 
the State Office that it will use the property for criminal justice 
purposes. If such certification is not made, title to the property shall 
vest in the State Office, which shall seek to have the property used for 
criminal justice purposes elsewhere in the state prior to using it or 
disposing of it in any other manner. If a State Office does not exist, 
certification will be made directly to the Bureau of Justice Assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 33.23  Limitations on fund use.

    In order to insure the most efficient and effective use of grant 
funds, the Justice Assistance Act places restrictions on the award of 
block monies for routine equipment, personnel costs, construction, 
supplanting of state and local funds, and land acquisition.
    (a) Equipment and hardware. The purchase or acquisition of equipment 
or hardware with grant funds is prohibited unless the purchase or 
acquisition is an incidental and necessary part of a program. Section 
406(c)(1) of the Act.
    (b) General salaries and personnel costs. Payment of personnel costs 
with grant funds is prohibited unless the costs are an incidental and 
necessary part of a program. Section 406(c)(1) of the Act. Programs 
which have as their primary purpose the payment of usual salaries

[[Page 515]]

paid to employees generally, or to specific classes of employees within 
a jurisdiction, are prohibited. Notwithstanding the above, grant funds 
may be used to compensate personnel for time engaged in conducting or 
undergoing training programs or the compensation of personnel engaged in 
research, development demonstration, or short-term programs. Section 
406(c)(2) of the Act.
    (c) Construction. Construction projects are prohibited. Section 
406(c)(3) of the Act.
    (d) Land acquisition. Acquisition of land with grant funds is 
prohibited. Section 406(c)(3) of the Act.
    (e) Ineffective programs. The use of grant funds is prohibited for 
programs or projects which, based upon evaluations by the National 
Institute of Justice, Bureau of Justice Assistance, Bureau of Justice 
Statistics, state or local agencies, and other public or private 
organizations, have been demonstrated to offer a low probability of 
improving the functioning of the criminal justice system. The Bureau of 
Justice Assistance will formally identify ineffective programs by notice 
in the Federal Register after opportunity for public comment. Section 
406(c)(4) of the Act.
    (f) Administrative costs. The use of grant funds to pay for costs 
incurred in applying for or administering the block grant is prohibited. 
Block grant funds may only be used to carry out programs that fall 
within one of the purposes listed in section 403(a) of the Justice 
Assistance Act. Section 403(a) of the Act.
    (g) Period of project support. A grant recipient may receive block 
grant funds for a specific program or project for a period not to exceed 
four years. The four-year maximum allowable period of funding includes 
any period prior to the Justice Assistance Act when the program or 
project was supported by funds made available under title I of the 
Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act. Section 403(c) of the Act.
    (h) Non-supplantation. Block grant funds shall not be used to 
supplant state or local funds, but will be used to increase the amounts 
of such funds that would, in the absence of Federal aid, be made 
available for criminal justice activities. Section 405(2) of the Act.

                      Purposes of Block Grant Funds


<R05>
Sec. 33.30  Program criteria.

    The Justice Assistance Act requires that block grant funds assist 
states and local governments to carry out specific programs which offer 
a high probability of improving the functioning of the criminal justice 
system, with special emphasis on violent crime and serious offenders. 
Section 403(a) of the Act.
    (a) High probability of improving the criminal justice system. High 
probability of improving the criminal justice system means that a 
prudent assessment of the concepts and implementation plans included in 
a proposed program, project, approach, or practice, together with an 
assessment of the problem to which it is addressed and of data and 
information bearing on the problem, concept, and implementation plan, 
provides strong evidence that the proposed activities would result in 
identifiable improvements in the criminal justice system if implemented 
as proposed. Section 901(a)(21) of the Act.
    (b) Special emphasis on violent crime and serious offenders. Special 
emphasis on violent crime and serious offenders means that a 
relationship exists between the program and violent crime, the victims 
of violent crime, serious offenders and their acts, and the prevention 
of violent crime and serious offenses. Violent crime, for the purpose of 
this program, includes homicide, robbery, assault, arson, residential 
burglary, child abuse and molestation, sexual assault, kidnapping, and 
all felonies involving weapons or narcotics trafficking. Serious 
offenders are those who commit violent crimes.
    (c) Criminal justice. Criminal justice means activities pertaining 
to crime prevention, control, or reduction, or the enforcement of the 
criminal law, including but not limited to, police efforts to prevent, 
control, or reduce crime or to apprehend criminals, including juveniles, 
activities of courts

[[Page 516]]

having criminal jurisdiction, and related agencies (including but not 
limited to prosecutorial and defender services, juvenile delinquency 
agencies, and pretrial service or release agencies), activities of 
corrections, probation or parole authorities and related agencies 
assisting in the rehabilitation, supervision, and care of criminal 
offenders, and programs relating to the prevention, control, or 
reduction of narcotic addiction and juvenile delinquency. Section 
901(a)(1) of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 33.31  Eligible purposes and programs.

    (a) Eligible purposes. Block grant funds may be used for the 
following purposes listed in section 403(a) of the Justice Assistance 
Act:
    (1) Providing community and neighborhood programs that enable 
citizens and police to undertake initiatives to prevent and control 
neighborhood crime;
    (2) Disrupting illicit commerce in stolen goods and property;
    (3) Combating arson;
    (4) Effectively investing and bringing to trial white-collar crime, 
organized crime, public corruption crimes, and fraud against the 
Government;
    (5) Identifying criminal cases involving persons (including juvenile 
offenders) with a history of serious criminal conduct in order to 
expedite the processing of such cases and to improve court system 
management and sentencing practices and procedures in such cases;
    (6) Developing and implementing programs which provide assistance to 
jurors and witnesses, and assistance (other than compensation) to 
victims of crimes;

    (a) The Act encourages the implementation of programs that have been 
proven successful. Pursuant to section 403(a)(14) of the Act, the Bureau 
of Justice Assistance, after a process of consultation coordinated by 
the Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Justice Programs with 
the National Institute of Justice, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, and 
the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, certifies 
that the following programs have been proven successful:
    (1)(i) Purpose: Providing community and neighborhood programs that 
enable citizens and police to undertake initiatives to prevent and 
control neighborhood crime.
    (ii) Certified program: Community crime prevention. This program 
aims to prevent crime and reduce the fear of crime through organized 
collective citizen action. Community crime prevention programs may be 
initiated by either law enforcement agencies or existing community 
groups, but each must have the active support and involvement of the 
other. Local programs must be designed to meet the needs and problems of 
specific neighborhoods or communities and particular population groups, 
including the elderly. They must make extensive use of volunteers. The 
specific services or activities to be implemented depend on the local 
situation and crime problem, but usually have, as a core element, 
neighborhood (block) watch with additional activities optional. Programs 
to provide training, technical assistance and other support services are 
also eligible for funding. Program objectives and elements are described 
in greater detail in the Program Brief on Community Crime Prevention.
    (A) Critical elements:
    (1) Pre-program planning to determine needs and problems of 
community.

    (ii) Certified program: Property Crime (STING) Program. This program 
targets the apprehension and prosecution of burglars/thieves as well as 
those individuals who provide the outlets for receipt of stolen goods 
and property. The majority of the model programs have established 
storefronts in which law enforcement officers pose as fences who buy 
stolen goods. In areas where there is a high concentration of organized 
crime, programs have employed techniques to infiltrate organizations in 
order to obtain evidence for prosecution of serious crime. Program 
objectives and elements are described in greater detail in the Program 
Brief on Property Crime (STING) Program.

assistance to jurors and witnesses, and assistance (other than 
compensation) to victims of crimes.
    (ii) Certified program: victim assistance. This program provides 
services and assistance to victims in order to speed their recovery from 
the financial loss,

[[Page 520]]

physical suffering and emotional trauma of victimization, and to assure 
proper and sensitive treatment of innocent victims in the criminal 
justice process. Victim assistance programs usually encompass a wide 
range of support services. The specific services to be provided, and the 
specific target group should reflect local needs and priorities. Program 
objectives and elements are described in greater detail in the Program 
Brief on Victim Assistance.
    (A) Critical elements:
    (1) Analysis of the community's victim/witness needs and problems.
    (2) Targeting of existing and planned activities and services to 
respond to this community situation.

and prison for persons who pose no danger to the community.
    (ii) Certified program: Jail overcrowding/alternatives to pretrial 
detention. This program aims to control jail population through improved 
intake screening which assures that persons who should be in jail are 
detained, and that alternatives are available for those requiring less 
than maximum supervision. Particular care must be taken that persons 
charged with violent crimes be detained and that the impact on victims 
and witnesses be a factor in screening decisions. The program calls for 
the development of a jail population management plan as part of a 
planning phase, followed by implementation of specific activities and 
services. Among the activities and services that may be funded are 
central intake and screening, pretrial services, diversion to 
detoxification centers, citation release, community corrections, 
sentencing alternatives, and jail management information systems.

proprietary software will be placed in the public domain.
    (ii) Certified program: Prosecution Management Support System 
(PMSS). This program is a specific application of the generic planning, 
implementation, and assessment requirements for effective system 
development and performance. PMSS uses automated data processing systems 
to support priority prosecution, improved conviction rates, speedy trial 
management, and improved efficiency/effectiveness of the

[[Page 522]]

prosecutor's office. Model programs result in information systems which 
support prosecution activities such as identification of violent and 
career criminals, case and subpoena preparation and witness 
notification. Systems are used to monitor management decisions and 
prosecutor actions and to reduce case processing time and case 
preparation time. Program objectives and elements are described in 
greater detail in the Program Brief on Prosecution Management Support 
System. This Program Brief has been designed to provide guidance for all 
criminal justice information systems. The critical elements for PMSS are

Statistics, and Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and 
Delinquency Prevention, as having proved successful.
    (15)(i) Purpose: Providing programs which address the problem of 
serious offenses committed by juveniles.
    (ii) Certified program: Restitution by juvenile offenders: This 
program promotes the use of restitution by juvenile offenders to make 
juveniles accountable to the victim and the community and to increase 
community confidence in the juvenile justice system. Juvenile 
restitution has been an effective alternative to incarceration in 
jurisdictions that have used it, reducing recidivism and providing 
benefits to victims. Assistance in the design and development of 
Juvenile Restitution Programs funded under this Program is available 
through the Restitution Education, Training and Technical Assistance 
(RESTTA) Program funded by the Office of Juvenile Justice and 
Delinquency Prevention. Program objectives and elements are described in

enforcement by integrating and maximizing the effectiveness of police 
field operations and the use of crime analysis techniques.
    (ii) Certified program: Integrated Criminal Apprehension Program 
(ICAP). This program integrates and directs law enforcement activities 
relative to the prevention, detection and investigation of serious and 
violent crime. Components of model programs have included systematic 
data collection and analysis, crime analysis, structured planning and 
service delivery. The program emphasizes better use of existing 
resources and better management of the patrol operation and

applications directly to the Bureau. A unit of local government 
receiving a block grant award directly from the Bureau assumes 
responsibility for all activities which would normally be the 
responsibility of the State Office.

<R04>
                          Subpart A_Competition


<R05>
Sec. 34.1  Purpose and applicability.

    (a) This subpart of the regulation implements section 262(d)(1) (A) 
and (B) of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, 
as amended (42 U.S.C. 5601 et seq.). This provision requires that 
project applications, selected for categorical assistance awards under 
part C--National Programs shall be selected through a competitive 
process established by rule by the Administrator, OJJDP. The statute 
specifies that this process must include announcement in the Federal 
Register of the availability of funds for assistance programs, the 
general criteria applicable to the selection of applications for 
assistance, and a description

[[Page 530]]

of the procedures applicable to the submission and review of assistance 
applications.
    (b) This subpart of the regulation applies to all grant, cooperative 
agreement, and other assistance awards selected by the Administrator, 
OJJDP, or the Administrator's designee, under part C--National Programs, 
of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, as 
amended, except as provided in the exceptions to applicability set forth 
below.


<R05>
Sec. 34.2  Exceptions to applicability.

    The following are assistance and procurement contract award 
situations that OJJDP considers to be outside the scope of the section 
262(d)(1) competition requirement:
    (a) Assistance awards to initially fund or continue projects if the 
Administrator has made a written determination that the proposed program 
is not within the scope of any program announcement expected to be 
issued, is otherwise eligible for an award, and the proposed project is 
of such outstanding merit, as determined through peer review under 
subpart B of this part, that an assistance award without competition is 
justified (section 262(d)(1)(B)(i));
    (b) Assistance awards to initially fund or continue training 
services to be funded under part C, section 244, if the Administrator 
has made a written determination that the applicant is uniquely 
qualified to provide proposed training services and other qualified 
sources are not capable of providing such services (section 
262(d)(1)(B)(ii));
    (c) Assistance awards of funds transferred to OJJDP by another 
Federal agency to augment authorized juvenile justice programs, 
projects, or purposes;
    (d) Funds transferred to other Federal agencies by OJJDP for program 
purposes as authorized by law;
    (e) Procurement contract awards which are subject to applicable 
Federal laws and regulations governing the procurement of goods and 
services for the benefit and use of the government;
    (f) Assistance awards from the 5% ``set aside'' of Special Emphasis 
funds under section 261(e); and
    (g) Assistance awards under section 241(f).


<R05>
Sec. 34.3  Selection criteria.

    (a) All individual project applications will, at a minimum, be 
subject to review based on the extent to which they meet the following 
general selection criteria:
    (1) The problem to be addressed by the project is clearly stated;
    (2) The objectives of the proposed project are clearly defined;
    (3) The project design is sound and contains program elements 
directly linked to the achievement of project objectives;
    (4) The project management structure is adequate to the successful 
conduct of the project;
    (5) Organizational capability is demonstrated at a level sufficient 
to successfully support the project; and
    (6) Budgeted costs are reasonable, allowable and cost effective for 
the activities proposed to be undertaken.
    (b) The general selection criteria set forth under paragraph (a) of 
this section, may be supplemented for each announced competitive program 
by program-specific selection criteria for the particular part C 
program. Such announcements may also modify the general selection 
criteria to provide greater specificity or otherwise improve their 
applicability to a given program. The relative weight (point value) for 
each selection criterion will be specified in the program announcement.


<R05>
Sec. 34.4  Additional competitive application requirements and procedures.

    (a) Applications for grants. Any applicant eligible for assistance 
may submit on or before such submission deadline date or dates as the 
Administrator may establish in program announcements, an application 
containing such pertinent information and in accordance with the forms 
and instructions as prescribed therein and any additional forms and 
instructions as may be specified by the Administrator. Such application 
shall be executed by the applicant or an official or representative of 
the applicant duly authorized to make such application and to assume on 
behalf of the applicant the obligations imposed by law, applicable 
regulations, and any additional terms and conditions of the assistance 
award. The Administrator may require any applicant

[[Page 531]]

eligible for assistance under this subpart to submit a preliminary 
proposal for review and approval prior to the acceptance of an 
application.
    (b) Cooperative arrangements. (1) When specified in program 
announcements, eligible parties may enter into cooperative arrangements 
with other eligible parties, including those in another State, and 
submit joint applications for assistance.
    (2) A joint application made by two or more applicants for 
assistance may have separate budgets corresponding to the programs, 
services and activities performed by each of the joint applicants or may 
have a combined budget. If joint applications present separate budgets, 
the Administrator may make separate awards, or may award a single 
assistance award authorizing separate amounts for each of the joint 
applicants.
    (c) Evaluation of applications submitted under part C of the Act. 
All applications filed in accordance with Sec. 34.1 of this subpart for 
assistance with part C--National Programs funds shall be evaluated by 
the Administrator through OJJDP and other DOJ personnel (internal 
review) and by such experts or consultants required for this purpose 
that the Administrator determines are specially qualified in the 
particular part C program area covered by the announced program (peer 
review). Supplementary application review procedures, in addition to 
internal review and peer review, may be used for each competitive part C 
program announcement. The program announcement shall clearly state the 
application review procedures (peer review and other) to be used for 
each competitive part C program announcement.
    (d) Applicant's performance on prior award. When the applicant has 
previously received an award from OJJDP or another Federal agency, the 
applicant's noncompliance with requirements applicable to such prior 
award as reflected in past written evaluation reports and memoranda on 
performance, and the completeness of required submissions, may be 
considered by the Administrator. In any case where the Administrator 
proposes to deny assistance based upon the applicant's noncompliance 
with requirements applicable to a prior award, the Administrator shall 
do so only after affording the applicant reasonable notice and an 
opportunity to rebut the proposed basis for denial of assistance.
    (e) Applicant's fiscal integrity. Applicants must meet OJP standard 
of fiscal integrity (see OJP M 7100.1C, par. 24 and OJP HB 4500.2B, par. 
48 a and b).
    (f) Disposition of applications. On the basis of competition and 
applicable review procedures completed pursuant to this regulation, the 
Administrator will either:
    (1) Approve the application for funding, in whole or in part, for 
such amount of funds, and subject to such conditions as the 
Administrator deems necessary or desirable for the completion of the 
approved project;
    (2) Determine that the application is of acceptable quality for 
funding, in that it meets minimum criteria, but that the application 
must be disapproved for funding because it did not rank sufficiently 
high in relation to other applications approved for funding to qualify 
for an award based on the level of funding allocated to the program; or
    (3) Reject the application for failure to meet the applicable 
selection criteria at a sufficiently high level to justify an award of 
funds, or for other reason which the Administrator deems compelling, as

                          Subpart B_Peer Review


<R05>
Sec. 34.100  Purpose and applicability.

    (a) This subpart of the regulation implements section 262(d)(2) of 
the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, as amended. 
This provision requires that projects funded as new or continuation 
programs selected for categorical assistance awards under part C--
National Programs shall be reviewed before selection and thereafter as 
appropriate through a formal peer review process. Such process must 
utilize experts (other than officials and employees of the Department of 
Justice) in fields related to the technical and/or subject matter of the 
proposed program.
    (b) This subpart of the regulation applies to all applications for 
grants, cooperative agreements, and other assistance awards selected by 
the Administrator, OJJDP, for funding under part C--National Programs 
that are being considered for competitive and noncompetitive (including 
continuation) awards to begin new project periods, except as provided in 
the exceptions to applicability set forth below.


<R05>
Sec. 34.101  Exceptions to applicability.

    The assistance and procurement contract situations specified in 
Sec. 34.2 (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g) of subpart A of this part are 
considered by OJJDP to be outside the scope of the section 262(d) peer 
review requirement as set forth in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 34.102  Peer review procedures.

    The OJJDP peer review process is contained in an OJJDP ``Peer Review 
Guideline,'' developed in consultation with the Directors and other 
appropriate officials of the National Science Foundation and the 
National Institute of Mental Health. In addition to specifying 
substantive and procedural matters related to the peer review process, 
the ``Guideline'' addresses such issues as standards of conduct, 
conflict of interest, compensation of peer reviewers, etc. The 
``Guideline'' describes a process that evolves in accordance with 
experience and opportunities to effect improvements. The peer review 
process for all part C--National Programs assistance awards subject to 
this regulation will be conducted in a manner consistent with this 
subpart as implemented in the ``Peer Review Guideline''.


<R05>
Sec. 34.103  Definition.

    Peer review means the technical and programmatic evaluation by a 
group of experts (other than officers and employees of the Department of 
Justice) qualified by training and experience to give expert advice, 
based on selection criteria established under subpart A of this part, in 
a program announcement, or as established by the Administrator, on the 
technical and programmatic merit of assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 34.104  Use of peer review.

    (a) Peer review for competitive and noncompetitive applications. (1) 
For competitive applications, each program announcement will indicate 
the program specific peer review procedures and selection criteria to be 
followed in peer review for that program. In the case of competitive 
programs for which a large number of applications is expected, 
preapplications (concept papers) may be required. Preapplications will 
be reviewed by qualified OJJDP staff to eliminate those pre-applications 
which fail to meet minimum program requirements, as specified in a 
program announcement, or clearly lack sufficient merit to qualify as 
potential candidates for funding consideration. The Administrator may 
subject both pre-applications and formal applications to the peer review 
process.
    (2) For noncompetitive applications, the general selection criteria 
set forth under subpart A of this part may be supplemented by program 
specific selection criteria for the particular part C program. 
Applicants for noncompetitive continuation awards will be fully informed 
of any additional specific criteria in writing.
    (b) When formal applications are required in response to a program 
announcement, an initial review will be conducted by qualified OJJDP 
staff, in order to eliminate from peer review

[[Page 533]]

consideration applications which do not meet minimum program 
requirements. Such requirements will be specified in the program 
announcement. Applications determined to be qualified and eligible for 
further consideration will then be considered under the peer review 
process.
    (c) Ratings will be in the form of numerical scores assigned by 
individual peer reviewers as illustrated in the OJJDP ``Peer Review 
Guideline.'' The results of peer review under a competitive program will 
be a relative aggregate ranking of applications in the form of ``Summary 
Ratings.'' The results of peer review for a noncompetitive new or 
continuation project will be in the form of numerical scores based on 
criteria established by the Administrator.
    (d) Peer review recommendations, in conjunction with the results of 
internal review and any necessary supplementary review, will assist the 
Administrator's consideration of competitive, noncompetitive, 
applications and selection of applications for funding.
    (e) Peer review recommendations are advisory only and are binding on 
the Administrator only as provided by section 262(d)(B)(i) for 
noncompetitive assistance awards to programs determined through peer 
review not to be of such outstanding merit that an award without 
competition is justified. In such case, the determination of whether to 
issue a competitive program announcement will be subject to the exercise 
of the Administrator's discretion.


<R05>
Sec. 34.105  Peer review methods.

    (a) For both competitive and noncompetitive applications, peer 
review will normally consist of written comments provided in response to 
the general selection criteria established under subpart A of this part 
and any program specific selection criteria identified in the program 
announcement or otherwise established by the Administrator, together 
with the assignment of numerical values. Peer review may be conducted at 
meetings with peer reviewers held under OJJDP oversight, through mail 
reviews, or a combination of both. When advisable, site visits may also 
be employed. The method of peer review anticipated for each announced 
competitive program, including the evaluation criteria to be used by 
peer reviewers, will be specified in each program announcement.
    (b) When peer review is conducted through meetings, peer review 
panelists will be gathered together for instruction by OJJDP, including 
review of the OJJDP ``Peer Review Guideline''. OJJDP will oversee the 
conduct of individual and group review sessions, as appropriate. When 
time or other factors preclude the convening of a peer review panel, 
mail reviews will be used. For competitive programs, mail reviews will 
be used only where the Administrator makes a written determination of 
necessity.


<R05>
Sec. 34.106  Number of peer reviewers.

    The number of peer reviewers will vary by program (as affected by 
the volume of applications anticipated or received). OJJDP will select a 
minimum of three peer reviewers (qualified individuals who are not 
officers or employees of the Department of Justice) for each program or 
project review in order to ensure a diversity of backgrounds and 
perspectives. In no case will fewer than three reviews be made of each 
individual application.


<R05>
Sec. 34.107  Use of Department of Justice staff.

    OJJDP will use qualified OJJDP and other DOJ staff as internal 
reviewers. Internal reviewers determine applicant compliance with basic 
program and statutory requirements, review the results of peer review, 
and provide overall program evaluation and recommendations to the 
Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 34.108  Selection of reviewers.

    The Program Manager, through the Director of the OJJDP program 
division with responsibility for a particular program or project will 
propose a selection of peer reviewers from an extensive and varied pool 
of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention experts for approval by 
the Administrator. The selection process for peer reviewers is detailed 
in the OJJDP ``Peer Review Guideline''.

[[Page 534]]


<R05>
Sec. 34.109  Qualifications of peer reviewers.

    The general reviewer qualification criteria to be used in the 
selection of peer reviewers are:
    (a) Generalized knowledge of juvenile justice or related fields; and
    (b) Specialized knowledge in areas or disciplines addressed by the 
applications to be reviewed under a particular program.
    (c) Must not have a conflict of interest (see OJP M7100.1C, par. 
94).

Additional details concerning peer reviewer qualifications are provided 
in the OJJDP ``Peer Review Guideline''.


<R05>
Sec. 34.110  Management of peer reviews.

    A technical support contractor may assist in managing the peer 
review process.


<R05>
Sec. 34.111  Compensation.

    All peer reviewers will be eligible to be paid according to 
applicable regulations and policies concerning consulting fees and 
reimbursement for expenses. Detailed information is provided in the 
OJJDP ``Peer Review Guideline''.

impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the public entity's 
program with respect to individuals with disabilities; or
    (iii) That perpetuate the discrimination of another public entity if 
both public entities are subject to common administrative control or are 
agencies of the same State.
    (4) A public entity may not, in determining the site or location of

benefits,

[[Page 539]]

services, or advantages to individuals with disabilities, or to a

by this part.
    (d) A public entity shall administer services, programs, and 
activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of 
qualified individuals with disabilities.
    (e)(1) Nothing in this part shall be construed to require an 
individual with a disability to accept an accommodation, aid, service, 
opportunity, or benefit provided under the ADA or this part which such 
individual chooses not to accept.
    (2) Nothing in the Act or this part authorizes the representative or 
guardian of an individual with a disability to decline food, water, 
medical treatment, or medical services for that individual.
    (f) A public entity may not place a surcharge on a particular 
individual with a disability or any group of individuals with 
disabilities to cover the costs of measures, such as the provision of

                     Subpart D_Program Accessibility


<R05>
Sec. 35.149  Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 35.150, no qualified 
individual with a disability shall, because a public entity's facilities 
are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with disabilities, be 
excluded from participation in, or be denied the benefits of the 
services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to 
discrimination by any public entity.


<R05>
Sec. 35.150  Existing facilities.

    (a) General. A public entity shall operate each service, program, or 
activity so that the service, program, or activity, when viewed in its 
entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with 
disabilities. This paragraph does not--
    (1) Necessarily require a public entity to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities;
    (2) Require a public entity to take any action that would threaten 
or destroy the historic significance of an historic property; or
    (3) Require a public entity to take any action that it can 
demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a 
service, program, or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where personnel of the public entity 
believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the service, 
program, or activity or would result in undue financial and 
administrative burdens, a public entity has the burden of proving that 
compliance with Sec. 35.150(a) of this part would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the head of a public entity or his 
or her designee after considering all resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the service, program, or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, a public entity shall take any other action that would

[[Page 541]]

not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless 
ensure that individuals with disabilities receive the benefits or 
services provided by the public entity.
    (b) Methods--(1) General. A public entity may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock or other 
conveyances, or any other methods that result in making its services, 
programs, or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals 
with disabilities. A public entity is not required to make structural 
changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in 
achieving compliance with this section. A public entity, in making 
alterations to existing buildings, shall meet the accessibility 
requirements of Sec. 35.151. In choosing among available methods for 
meeting the requirements of this section, a public entity shall give 
priority to those methods that offer services, programs, and activities 
to qualified individuals with disabilities in the most integrated 
setting appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 35.150(a) in historic preservation programs, a public entity shall 
give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals 
with disabilities. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic 
property is not required because of paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this 
section, alternative methods of achieving program accessibility 
include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or 
through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. Where structural changes in 
facilities are undertaken to comply with the obligations established 
under this section, such changes shall be made within three years of 
January 26, 1992, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.
    (d) Transition plan. (1) In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, a public 
entity that employs 50 or more persons shall develop, within six months 
of January 26, 1992, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary 
to complete such changes. A public entity shall provide an opportunity 
to interested persons, including individuals with disabilities or 
organizations representing individuals with disabilities, to participate 
in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments. A copy 
of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection.
    (2) If a public entity has responsibility or authority over streets, 
roads, or walkways, its transition plan shall include a schedule for 
providing curb ramps or other sloped areas where pedestrian walks cross 
curbs, giving priority to walkways serving entities covered by the Act, 
including State and local government offices and facilities, 
transportation, places of public accommodation, and employers, followed 
by walkways serving other areas.
    (3) The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (i) Identify physical obstacles in the public entity's facilities 
that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to 
individuals with disabilities;
    (ii) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (iii) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (iv) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.
    (4) If a public entity has already complied with the transition plan 
requirement of a Federal agency regulation implementing section 504 of 
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, then the requirements of this paragraph 
(d) shall apply

[[Page 542]]

only to those policies and practices that were not included in the 
previous transition plan.

    (a) Design and construction. Each facility or part of a facility 
constructed by, on behalf of, or for the use of a public entity shall be 
designed and constructed in such manner that the facility or part of the 
facility is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with 
disabilities, if the construction was commenced after January 26, 1992.
    (b) Alteration. Each facility or part of a facility altered by, on 
behalf of, or for the use of a public entity in a manner that affects or 
could affect the usability of the facility or part of the facility

the altered portion of the facility is readily accessible to and usable 
by individuals with disabilities, if the alteration was commenced after 
January 26, 1992.
    (c) Accessibility standards. Design, construction, or alteration of 
facilities in conformance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility 
Standards (UFAS) (appendix A to 41 CFR part 101-19.6) or with the 
Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings 
and Facilities (ADAAG) (appendix A to 28 CFR part 36) shall be deemed to 
comply with the requirements of this section with respect to those 
facilities, except that the elevator exemption contained at section 
4.1.3(5) and section 4.1.6(1)(k) of ADAAG shall not apply. Departures 
from particular requirements of either standard by the use of other 
methods shall be permitted when it is clearly evident that equivalent 
access to the facility or part of the facility is thereby provided.
    (d) Alterations: Historic properties. (1) Alterations to historic 
properties shall comply, to the maximum extent feasible, with section 
4.1.7 of UFAS or section 4.1.7 of ADAAG.
    (2) If it is not feasible to provide physical access to an historic 
property in a manner that will not threaten or destroy the historic 
significance of the building or facility, alternative methods of access 
shall be provided pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 35.150.
    (e) Curb ramps. (1) Newly constructed or altered streets, roads, and 
highways must contain curb ramps or other sloped areas at any 
intersection having curbs or other barriers to entry from a street level 
pedestrian walkway.
    (2) Newly constructed or altered street level pedestrian walkways 
must contain curb ramps or other sloped areas at intersections to 
streets, roads, or highways.

Sec. 35.164  Duties.

    This subpart does not require a public entity to take any action 
that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a service, program, or activity or in undue financial and 
administrative burdens. In those circumstances where personnel of the 
public entity believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter 
the service, program, or activity or would result in undue financial and

an action required to comply with this subpart would result in such an 
alteration or such burdens, a public entity shall take any other action 
that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would 
nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals 
with disabilities receive the benefits or services provided by the 
public entity.

    Note: For the convenience of the reader, this appendix contains the 
text of the preamble to the final regulation on nondiscrimination on the 
basis of disability in State and local government services beginning at 
the heading ``Section-by-Section Analysis'' and ending before ``List of

                         Section 35.101 Purpose

    Section 35.101 states the purpose of the rule, which is to 
effectuate subtitle A of title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act 
of 1990 (the Act), which prohibits discrimination on the basis of 
disability by public entities. This part does not, however, apply to 
matters within the scope of the authority of the Secretary of 
Transportation under subtitle B of title II of the Act.

                       Section 35.102 Application

    This provision specifies that, except as provided in paragraph (b), 
the regulation applies to all services, programs, and activities 
provided or made available by public entities, as that term is defined 
in Sec. 35.104. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 
U.S.C. 794), which prohibits discrimination on the basis of handicap in 
federally assisted programs and activities, already covers those 
programs and activities of public entities that receive Federal 
financial assistance. Title II of the ADA extends this prohibition of 
discrimination to include all services, programs, and activities 
provided or made available by State and local governments or any of 
their instrumentalities or agencies, regardless of the receipt of 
Federal financial assistance. Except as provided in Sec. 35.l34, this 
part does not apply to private entities.
    The scope of title II's coverage of public entities is comparable to 
the coverage of Federal Executive agencies under the 1978 amendment to 
section 504, which extended section 504's application to all programs 
and activities ``conducted by'' Federal Executive agencies, in that 
title II applies to anything a public entity does. Title II coverage, 
however, is not limited to ``Executive'' agencies, but includes 
activities of the legislative and judicial branches of State and local 
governments. All governmental activities of public entities are covered, 
even if they are carried out by contractors. For example, a State is 
obligated by title II to ensure that the services, programs, and 
activities of a State park inn operated under contract by a private 
entity are in compliance with title II's requirements. The private 
entity operating the inn would also be subject to the obligations of 
public accommodations under title III of the Act and the Department's 
title III regulations at 28 CFR part 36.
    Aside from employment, which is also covered by title I of the Act, 
there are two major categories of programs or activities covered by this 
regulation: those involving general public contact as part of ongoing 
operations of the entity and those directly administered by the entities 
for program beneficiaries and participants. Activities in the first 
category include communication with

[[Page 547]]

the public (telephone contacts, office walk-ins, or interviews) and the 
public's use of the entity's facilities. Activities in the second 
category include programs that provide State or local government 
services or benefits.
    Paragraph (b) of Sec. 35.102 explains that to the extent that the 
public transportation services, programs, and activities of public 
entities are covered by subtitle B of title II of the Act, they are 
subject to the regulation of the Department of Transportation (DOT) at 
49 CFR part 37, and are not covered by this part. The Department of 
Transportation's ADA regulation establishes specific requirements for 
construction of transportation facilities and acquisition of vehicles. 
Matters not covered by subtitle B, such as the provision of auxiliary 
aids, are covered by this rule. For example, activities that are covered 
by the Department of Transportation's regulation implementing subtitle B 
are not required to be included in the self-evaluation required by Sec. 
35.105. In addition, activities not specifically addressed by DOT's ADA 
regulation may be covered by DOT's regulation implementing section 504 
for its federally assisted programs and activities at 49 CFR part 27. 
Like other programs of public entities that are also recipients of 
Federal financial assistance, those programs would be covered by both 
the section 504 regulation and this part. Although airports operated by 
public entities are not subject to DOT's ADA regulation, they are 
subject to subpart A of title II and to this rule.
    Some commenters asked for clarification about the responsibilities 
of public school systems under section 504 and the ADA with respect to 
programs, services, and activities that are not covered by the 
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), including, for 
example, programs open to parents or to the public, graduation 
ceremonies, parent-teacher organization meetings, plays and other events 
open to the public, and adult education classes. Public school systems 
must comply with the ADA in all of their services, programs, or 
activities, including those that are open to parents or to the public. 
For instance, public school systems must provide program accessibility 
to parents and guardians with disabilities to these programs, 
activities, or services, and appropriate auxiliary aids and services 
whenever necessary to ensure effective communication, as long as the 
provision of the auxiliary aids results neither in an undue burden or in 
a fundamental alteration of the program.

                Section 35.103 Relationship to Other Laws

    Section 35.103 is derived from sections 501 (a) and (b) of the ADA. 
Paragraph (a) of this section provides that, except as otherwise 
specifically provided by this part, title II of the ADA is not intended 
to apply lesser standards than are required under title V of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 790-94), or the 
regulations implementing that title. The standards of title V of the 
Rehabilitation Act apply for purposes of the ADA to the extent that the 
ADA has not explicitly adopted a different standard than title V. 
Because title II of the ADA essentially extends the antidiscrimination 
prohibition embodied in section 504 to all actions of State and local 
governments, the standards adopted in this part are generally the same 
as those required under section 504 for federally assisted programs. 
Title II, however, also incorporates those provisions of titles I and 
III of the ADA that are not inconsistent with the regulations 
implementing section 504. Judiciary Committee report, H.R. Rep. No. 485, 
101st Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 3, at 51 (1990) (hereinafter ``Judiciary 
report'') ; Education and Labor Committee report, H.R. Rep. No. 485, 
101st Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, at 84 (1990) (hereinafter ``Education and 
Labor report''). Therefore, this part also includes appropriate 
provisions derived from the regulations implementing those titles. The 
inclusion of specific language in this part, however, should not be 
interpreted as an indication that a requirement is not included under a 
regulation implementing section 504.
    Paragraph (b) makes clear that Congress did not intend to displace 
any of the rights or remedies provided by other Federal laws (including 
section 504) or other State laws (including State common law) that 
provide greater or equal protection to individuals with disabilities. As 
discussed above, the standards adopted by title II of the ADA for State 
and local government services are generally the same as those required 
under section 504 for federally assisted programs and activities. 
Subpart F of the regulation establishes compliance procedures for 
processing complaints covered by both this part and section 504.
    With respect to State law, a plaintiff may choose to pursue claims 
under a State law that does not confer greater substantive rights, or 
even confers fewer substantive rights, if the alleged violation is 
protected under the alternative law and the remedies are greater. For 
example, a person with a physical disability could seek damages under a 
State law that allows compensatory and punitive damages for 
discrimination on the basis of physical disability, but not on the basis 
of mental disability. In that situation, the State law would provide 
narrower coverage, by excluding mental disabilities, but broader 
remedies, and an individual covered by both laws could choose to bring 
an action under both laws. Moreover, State tort claims confer greater 
remedies and are not preempted by the ADA. A plaintiff may join a State 
tort claim to a case brought under the

[[Page 548]]

ADA. In such a case, the plaintiff must, of course, prove all the 
elements of the State tort claim in order to prevail under that cause of 
action.

                       Section 35.104 Definitions

    ``Act.'' The word ``Act'' is used in this part to refer to the 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Public Law 101-336, which is 
also referred to as the ``ADA.''
    ``Assistant Attorney General.'' The term ``Assistant Attorney 
General'' refers to the Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Rights 
Division of the Department of Justice.
    ``Auxiliary aids and services.'' Auxiliary aids and services include 
a wide range of services and devices for ensuring effective 
communication. The proposed definition in Sec. 35.104 provided a list 
of examples of auxiliary aids and services that were taken from the 
definition of auxiliary aids and services in section 3(1) of the ADA and 
were supplemented by examples from regulations implementing section 504 
in federally conducted programs (see 28 CFR 39.103).
    A substantial number of commenters suggested that additional 
examples be added to this list. The Department has added several items 
to this list but wishes to clarify that the list is not an all-inclusive 
or exhaustive catalogue of possible or available auxiliary aids or 
services. It is not possible to provide an exhaustive list, and an 
attempt to do so would omit the new devices that will become available 
with emerging technology.
    Subparagraph (1) lists several examples, which would be considered 
auxiliary aids and services to make aurally delivered materials 
available to individuals with hearing impairments. The Department has 
changed the phrase used in the proposed rules, ``orally delivered 
materials,'' to the statutory phrase, ``aurally delivered materials,'' 
to track section 3 of the ADA and to include non-verbal sounds and 
alarms, and computer generated speech.
    The Department has added videotext displays, transcription services, 
and closed and open captioning to the list of examples. Videotext 
displays have become an important means of accessing auditory 
communications through a public address system. Transcription services 
are used to relay aurally delivered material almost simultaneously in 
written form to persons who are deaf or hearing-impaired. This 
technology is often used at conferences, conventions, and hearings. 
While the proposed rule expressly included television decoder equipment 
as an auxiliary aid or service, it did not mention captioning itself. 
The final rule rectifies this omission by mentioning both closed and 
open captioning.
    Several persons and organizations requested that the Department 
replace the term ``telecommunications devices for deaf persons'' or 
``TDD's'' with the term ``text telephone.'' The Department has declined 
to do so. The Department is aware that the Architectural and 
Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (ATBCB) has used the phrase 
``text telephone'' in lieu of the statutory term ``TDD'' in its final 
accessibility guidelines. Title IV of the ADA, however, uses the term 
``Telecommunications Device for the Deaf'' and the Department believes 
it would be inappropriate to abandon this statutory term at this time.
    Several commenters urged the Department to include in the definition 
of ``auxiliary aids and services'' devices that are now available or 
that may become available with emerging technology. The Department 
declines to do so in the rule. The Department, however, emphasizes that, 
although the definition would include ``state of the art'' devices, 
public entities are not required to use the newest or most advanced 
technologies as long as the auxiliary aid or service that is selected 
affords effective communication.
    Subparagraph (2) lists examples of aids and services for making 
visually delivered materials accessible to persons with visual 
impairments. Many commenters proposed additional examples, such as 
signage or mapping, audio description services, secondary auditory 
programs, telebraillers, and reading machines. While the Department 
declines to add these items to the list, they are auxiliary aids and 
services and may be appropriate depending on the circumstances.
    Subparagraph (3) refers to acquisition or modification of equipment 
or devices. Several commenters suggested the addition of current 
technological innovations in microelectronics and computerized control 
systems (e.g., voice recognition systems, automatic dialing telephones, 
and infrared elevator and light control systems) to the list of 
auxiliary aids. The Department interprets auxiliary aids and services as 
those aids and services designed to provide effective communications, 
i.e., making aurally and visually delivered information available to 
persons with hearing, speech, and vision impairments. Methods of making 
services, programs, or activities accessible to, or usable by, 
individuals with mobility or manual dexterity impairments are addressed 
by other sections of this part, including the provision for 
modifications in policies, practices, or procedures (Sec. 35.130 
(b)(7)).
    Paragraph (b)(4) deals with other similar services and actions. 
Several commenters asked for clarification that ``similar services and 
actions'' include retrieving items from shelves, assistance in reaching 
a marginally accessible seat, pushing a barrier aside in order to 
provide an accessible route, or assistance in removing a sweater or 
coat. While retrieving an item from a shelf might be an ``auxiliary aid 
or service'' for a blind

[[Page 549]]

person who could not locate the item without assistance, it might be a 
method of providing program access for a person using a wheelchair who 
could not reach the shelf, or a reasonable modification to a self-
service policy for an individual who lacked the ability to grasp the 
item. As explained above, auxiliary aids and services are those aids and 
services required to provide effective communications. Other forms of 
assistance are more appropriately addressed by other provisions of the 
final rule.
    ``Complete complaint.'' ``Complete complaint'' is defined to include 
all the information necessary to enable the Federal agency designated 
under subpart G as responsible for investigation of a complaint to 
initiate its investigation.
    ``Current illegal use of drugs.'' The phrase ``current illegal use 
of drugs'' is used in Sec. 35.131. Its meaning is discussed in the 
preamble for that section.
    ``Designated agency.'' The term ``designated agency'' is used to 
refer to the Federal agency designated under subpart G of this rule as 
responsible for carrying out the administrative enforcement 
responsibilities established by subpart F of the rule.
    ``Disability.'' The definition of the term ``disability'' is the 
same as the definition in the title III regulation codified at 28 CFR 
part 36. It is comparable to the definition of the term ``individual 
with handicaps'' in section 7(8) of the Rehabilitation Act and section 
802(h) of the Fair Housing Act. The Education and Labor Committee report 
makes clear that the analysis of the term ``individual with handicaps'' 
by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) in its 
regulations implementing section 504 (42 FR 22685 (May 4, 1977)) and the 
analysis by the Department of Housing and Urban Development in its 
regulation implementing the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (54 FR 
3232 (Jan. 23, 1989)) should also apply fully to the term ``disability'' 
(Education and Labor report at 50).
    The use of the term ``disability'' instead of ``handicap'' and the 
term ``individual with a disability'' instead of ``individual with 
handicaps'' represents an effort by Congress to make use of up-to-date, 
currently accepted terminology. As with racial and ethnic epithets, the 
choice of terms to apply to a person with a disability is overlaid with 
stereotypes, patronizing attitudes, and other emotional connotations. 
Many individuals with disabilities, and organizations representing such 
individuals, object to the use of such terms as ``handicapped person'' 
or ``the handicapped.'' In other recent legislation, Congress also 
recognized this shift in terminology, e.g., by changing the name of the 
National Council on the Handicapped to the National Council on 
Disability (Pub. L. 100-630).
    In enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act, Congress concluded 
that it was important for the current legislation to use terminology 
most in line with the sensibilities of most Americans with disabilities. 
No change in definition or substance is intended nor should one be 
attributed to this change in phraseology.
    The term ``disability'' means, with respect to an individual--
    (A) A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or 
more of the major life activities of such individual;
    (B) A record of such an impairment; or
    (C) Being regarded as having such an impairment. If an individual 
meets any one of these three tests, he or she is considered to be an 
individual with a disability for purposes of coverage under the 
Americans with Disabilities Act.
    Congress adopted this same basic definition of ``disability,'' first 
used in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and in the Fair Housing 
Amendments Act of 1988, for a number of reasons. First, it has worked 
well since it was adopted in 1974. Second, it would not be possible to 
guarantee comprehensiveness by providing a list of specific 
disabilities, especially because new disorders may be recognized in the 
future, as they have since the definition was first established in 1974.

Test A--A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or 
          more of the major life activities of such individual

    Physical or mental impairment. Under the first test, an individual 
must have a physical or mental impairment. As explained in paragraph 
(1)(i) of the definition, ``impairment'' means any physiological 
disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss 
affecting one or more of the following body systems: neurological; 
musculoskeletal; special sense organs (which would include speech organs 
that are not respiratory such as vocal cords, soft palate, tongue, 
etc.); respiratory, including speech organs; cardiovascular; 
reproductive; digestive; genitourinary; hemic and lymphatic; skin; and 
endocrine. It also means any mental or psychological disorder, such as 
mental retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, 
and specific learning disabilities. This list closely tracks the one 
used in the regulations for section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 
1973 (see, e.g., 45 CFR 84.3(j)(2)(i)).
    Many commenters asked that ``traumatic brain injury'' be added to 
the list in paragraph (1)(i). Traumatic brain injury is already included 
because it is a physiological condition affecting one of the listed body 
systems, i.e., ``neurological.'' Therefore, it was unnecessary to add 
the term to the regulation, which only provides representative examples 
of physiological disorders.

[[Page 550]]

    It is not possible to include a list of all the specific conditions, 
contagious and noncontagious diseases, or infections that would 
constitute physical or mental impairments because of the difficulty of 
ensuring the comprehensiveness of such a list, particularly in light of 
the fact that other conditions or disorders may be identified in the 
future. However, the list of examples in paragraph (1)(ii) of the 
definition includes: orthopedic, visual, speech and hearing impairments, 
cerebral palsy, epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, 
cancer, heart disease, diabetes, mental retardation, emotional illness, 
specific learning disabilities, HIV disease (symptomatic or 
asymptomatic), tuberculosis, drug addiction, and alcoholism. The phrase 
``symptomatic or asymptomatic'' was inserted in the final rule after 
``HIV disease'' in response to commenters who suggested the 
clarification was necessary.
    The examples of ``physical or mental impairments'' in paragraph 
(1)(ii) are the same as those contained in many section 504 regulations, 
except for the addition of the phrase ``contagious and noncontagious'' 
to describe the types of diseases and conditions included, and the 
addition of ``HIV disease (symptomatic or asymptomatic)'' and 
``tuberculosis'' to the list of examples. These additions are based on 
the committee reports, caselaw, and official legal opinions interpreting 
section 504. In School Board of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273 
(1987), a case involving an individual with tuberculosis, the Supreme 
Court held that people with contagious diseases are entitled to the 
protections afforded by section 504. Following the Arline decision, this 
Department's Office of Legal Counsel issued a legal opinion that 
concluded that symptomatic HIV disease is an impairment that 
substantially limits a major life activity; therefore it has been 
included in the definition of disability under this part. The opinion 
also concluded that asymptomatic HIV disease is an impairment that 
substantially limits a major life activity, either because of its actual 
effect on the individual with HIV disease or because the reactions of 
other people to individuals with HIV disease cause such individuals to 
be treated as though they are disabled. See Memorandum from Douglas W. 
Kmiec, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, 
Department of Justice, to Arthur B. Culvahouse, Jr., Counsel to the 
President (Sept. 27, 1988), reprinted in Hearings on S. 933, the 
Americans with Disabilities Act, Before the Subcomm. on the Handicapped 
of the Senate Comm. on Labor and Human Resources, 101st. Cong., 1st 
Sess. 346 (1989).
    Paragraph (1)(iii) states that the phrase ``physical or mental 
impairment'' does not include homosexuality or bisexuality. These 
conditions were never considered impairments under other Federal 
disability laws. Section 511(a) of the statute makes clear that they are 
likewise not to be considered impairments under the Americans with 
Disabilities Act.
    Physical or mental impairment does not include simple physical 
characteristics, such as blue eyes or black hair. Nor does it include 
environmental, cultural, economic, or other disadvantages, such as 
having a prison record, or being poor. Nor is age a disability. 
Similarly, the definition does not include common personality traits 
such as poor judgment or a quick temper where these are not symptoms of 
a mental or psychological disorder. However, a person who has these 
characteristics and also has a physical or mental impairment may be 
considered as having a disability for purposes of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act based on the impairment.
    Substantial Limitation of a Major Life Activity. Under Test A, the 
impairment must be one that ``substantially limits a major life 
activity.'' Major life activities include such things as caring for 
one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, 
breathing, learning, and working.
    For example, a person who is paraplegic is substantially limited in 
the major life activity of walking, a person who is blind is 
substantially limited in the major life activity of seeing, and a person 
who is mentally retarded is substantially limited in the major life 
activity of learning. A person with traumatic brain injury is 
substantially limited in the major life activities of caring for one's 
self, learning, and working because of memory deficit, confusion, 
contextual difficulties, and inability to reason appropriately.
    A person is considered an individual with a disability for purposes 
of Test A, the first prong of the definition, when the individual's 
important life activities are restricted as to the conditions, manner, 
or duration under which they can be performed in comparison to most 
people. A person with a minor, trivial impairment, such as a simple 
infected finger, is not impaired in a major life activity. A person who 
can walk for 10 miles continuously is not substantially limited in 
walking merely because, on the eleventh mile, he or she begins to 
experience pain, because most people would not be able to walk eleven 
miles without experiencing some discomfort.
    The Department received many comments on the proposed rule's 
inclusion of the word ``temporary'' in the definition of ``disability.'' 
The preamble indicated that impairments are not necessarily excluded 
from the definition of ``disability'' simply because they are temporary, 
but that the duration, or expected duration, of an impairment is one 
factor that may properly be considered in determining whether the 
impairment substantially limits a major life activity. The

[[Page 551]]

preamble recognized, however, that temporary impairments, such as a 
broken leg, are not commonly regarded as disabilities, and only in rare 
circumstances would the degree of the limitation and its expected 
duration be substantial. Nevertheless, many commenters objected to 
inclusion of the word ``temporary'' both because it is not in the 
statute and because it is not contained in the definition of 
``disability'' set forth in the title I regulations of the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The word ``temporary'' has 
been deleted from the final rule to conform with the statutory language.
    The question of whether a temporary impairment is a disability must 
be resolved on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration both the 
duration (or expected duration) of the impairment and the extent to 
which it actually limits a major life activity of the affected 
individual.
    The question of whether a person has a disability should be assessed 
without regard to the availability of mitigating measures, such as 
reasonable modification or auxiliary aids and services. For example, a 
person with hearing loss is substantially limited in the major life 
activity of hearing, even though the loss may be improved through the 
use of a hearing aid. Likewise, persons with impairments, such as 
epilepsy or diabetes, that substantially limit a major life activity, 
are covered under the first prong of the definition of disability, even 
if the effects of the impairment are controlled by medication.
    Many commenters asked that environmental illness (also known as 
multiple chemical sensitivity) as well as allergy to cigarette smoke be 
recognized as disabilities. The Department, however, declines to state 
categorically that these types of allergies or sensitivities are 
disabilities, because the determination as to whether an impairment is a 
disability depends on whether, given the particular circumstances at 
issue, the impairment substantially limits one or more major life 
activities (or has a history of, or is regarded as having such an 
effect).
    Sometimes respiratory or neurological functioning is so severely 
affected that an individual will satisfy the requirements to be 
considered disabled under the regulation. Such an individual would be 
entitled to all of the protections afforded by the Act and this part. In 
other cases, individuals may be sensitive to environmental elements or 
to smoke but their sensitivity will not rise to the level needed to 
constitute a disability. For example, their major life activity of 
breathing may be somewhat, but not substantially, impaired. In such 
circumstances, the individuals are not disabled and are not entitled to 
the protections of the statute despite their sensitivity to 
environmental agents.
    In sum, the determination as to whether allergies to cigarette 
smoke, or allergies or sensitivities characterized by the commenters as 
environmental illness are disabilities covered by the regulation must be 
made using the same case-by-case analysis that is applied to all other 
physical or mental impairments. Moreover, the addition of specific 
regulatory provisions relating to environmental illness in the final 
rule would be inappropriate at this time pending future consideration of 
the issue by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance 
Board, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Occupational Safety 
and Health Administration of the Department of Labor.

                 Test B--A record of such an impairment

    This test is intended to cover those who have a record of an 
impairment. As explained in paragraph (3) of the rule's definition of 
disability, this includes a person who has a history of an impairment 
that substantially limited a major life activity, such as someone who 
has recovered from an impairment. It also includes persons who have been 
misclassified as having an impairment.
    This provision is included in the definition in part to protect 
individuals who have recovered from a physical or mental impairment that 
previously substantially limited them in a major life activity. 
Discrimination on the basis of such a past impairment is prohibited. 
Frequently occurring examples of the first group (those who have a 
history of an impairment) are persons with histories of mental or 
emotional illness, heart disease, or cancer; examples of the second 
group (those who have been misclassified as having an impairment) are 
persons who have been misclassified as having mental retardation or 
mental illness.

           Test C--Being regarded as having such an impairment

    This test, as contained in paragraph (4) of the definition, is 
intended to cover persons who are treated by a public entity as having a 
physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life 
activity. It applies when a person is treated as if he or she has an 
impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, regardless 
of whether that person has an impairment.
    The Americans with Disabilities Act uses the same ``regarded as'' 
test set forth in the regulations implementing section 504 of the 
Rehabilitation Act. See, e.g., 28 CFR 42.540(k)(2)(iv), which provides:
    (iv) ``Is regarded as having an impairment'' means (A) Has a 
physical or mental impairment that does not substantially limit major 
life activities but that is treated by a recipient as constituting such 
a limitation; (B) Has a physical or mental impairment that substantially 
limits major life activities only as a result of the attitudes of others 
toward such impairment; or (C) Has none of

[[Page 552]]

the impairments defined in paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section but is 
treated by a recipient as having such an impairment.
    The perception of the covered entity is a key element of this test. 
A person who perceives himself or herself to have an impairment, but 
does not have an impairment, and is not treated as if he or she has an 
impairment, is not protected under this test.
    A person would be covered under this test if a public entity refused 
to serve the person because it perceived that the person had an 
impairment that limited his or her enjoyment of the goods or services 
being offered.
    For example, persons with severe burns often encounter 
discrimination in community activities, resulting in substantial 
limitation of major life activities. These persons would be covered 
under this test based on the attitudes of others towards the impairment, 
even if they did not view themselves as ``impaired.''
    The rationale for this third test, as used in the Rehabilitation Act 
of 1973, was articulated by the Supreme Court in Arline, 480 U.S. 273 
(1987). The Court noted that although an individual may have an 
impairment that does not in fact substantially limit a major life 
activity, the reaction of others may prove just as disabling. ``Such an 
impairment might not diminish a person's physical or mental 
capabilities, but could nevertheless substantially limit that person's 
ability to work as a result of the negative reactions of others to the 
impairment.'' Id. at 283. The Court concluded that, by including this 
test in the Rehabilitation Act's definition, ``Congress acknowledged 
that society's accumulated myths and fears about disability and diseases 
are as handicapping as are the physical limitations that flow from 
actual impairment.'' Id. at 284.
    Thus, a person who is denied services or benefits by a public entity 
because of myths, fears, and stereotypes associated with disabilities 
would be covered under this third test whether or not the person's 
physical or mental condition would be considered a disability under the 
first or second test in the definition.
    If a person is refused admittance on the basis of an actual or 
perceived physical or mental condition, and the public entity can 
articulate no legitimate reason for the refusal (such as failure to meet 
eligibility criteria), a perceived concern about admitting persons with 
disabilities could be inferred and the individual would qualify for 
coverage under the ``regarded as'' test. A person who is covered because 
of being regarded as having an impairment is not required to show that 
the public entity's perception is inaccurate (e.g., that he will be 
accepted by others) in order to receive benefits from the public entity.
    Paragraph (5) of the definition lists certain conditions that are 
not included within the definition of ``disability.'' The excluded 
conditions are: Transvestism, transsexualism, pedophilia, exhibitionism, 
voyeurism, gender identity disorders not resulting from physical 
impairments, other sexual behavior disorders, compulsive gambling, 
kleptomania, pyromania, and psychoactive substance use disorders 
resulting from current illegal use of drugs. Unlike homosexuality and 
bisexuality, which are not considered impairments under either section 
504 or the Americans with Disabilities Act (see the definition of 
``disability,'' paragraph (1)(iv)), the conditions listed in paragraph 
(5), except for transvestism, are not necessarily excluded as 
impairments under section 504. (Transvestism was excluded from the 
definition of disability for section 504 by the Fair Housing Amendments 
Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-430, section 6(b)).
    ``Drug.'' The definition of the term ``drug'' is taken from section 
510(d)(2) of the ADA.
    ``Facility.'' ``Facility'' means all or any portion of buildings, 
structures, sites, complexes, equipment, rolling stock or other 
conveyances, roads, walks, passageways, parking lots, or other real or 
personal property, including the site where the building, property, 
structure, or equipment is located. It includes both indoor and outdoor 
areas where human-constructed improvements, structures, equipment, or 
property have been added to the natural environment.
    Commenters raised questions about the applicability of this part to 
activities operated in mobile facilities, such as bookmobiles or mobile 
health screening units. Such activities would be covered by the 
requirement for program accessibility in Sec. 35.150, and would be 
included in the definition of ``facility'' as ``other real or personal 
property,'' although standards for new construction and alterations of 
such facilities are not yet included in the accessibility standards 
adopted by Sec. 35.151. Sections 35.150 and 35.151 specifically address 
the obligations of public entities to ensure accessibility by providing 
curb ramps at pedestrian walkways.
    ``Historic preservation programs'' and ``Historic properties'' are 
defined in order to aid in the interpretation of Sec. Sec. 35.150 
(a)(2) and (b)(2), which relate to accessibility of historic 
preservation programs, and Sec. 35.151(d), which relates to the 
alteration of historic properties.
    ``Illegal use of drugs.'' The definition of ``illegal use of drugs'' 
is taken from section 510(d)(1) of the Act and clarifies that the term 
includes the illegal use of one or more drugs.
    ``Individual with a disability'' means a person who has a disability 
but does not include an individual who is currently illegally using 
drugs, when the public entity acts on the basis of such use. The phrase 
``current illegal use of drugs'' is explained in Sec. 35.131.

[[Page 553]]

    ``Public entity.'' The term ``public entity'' is defined in 
accordance with section 201(1) of the ADA as any State or local 
government; any department, agency, special purpose district, or other 
instrumentality of a State or States or local government; or the 
National Railroad Passenger Corporation, and any commuter authority (as 
defined in section 103(8) of the Rail Passenger Service Act).
    ``Qualified individual with a disability.'' The definition of 
``qualified individual with a disability'' is taken from section 201(2) 
of the Act, which is derived from the definition of ``qualified 
handicapped person'' in the Department of Health and Human Services' 
regulation implementing section 504 (45 CFR Sec. 84.3(k)). It combines 
the definition at 45 CFR 84.3(k)(1) for employment (``a handicapped 
person who, with reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential 
functions of the job in question'') with the definition for other 
services at 45 CFR 84.3(k)(4) (``a handicapped person who meets the 
essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of such services'').
    Some commenters requested clarification of the term ``essential 
eligibility requirements.'' Because of the variety of situations in 
which an individual's qualifications will be at issue, it is not 
possible to include more specific criteria in the definition. The 
``essential eligibility requirements'' for participation in some 
activities covered under this part may be minimal. For example, most 
public entities provide information about their operations as a public 
service to anyone who requests it. In such situations, the only 
``eligibility requirement'' for receipt of such information would be the 
request for it. Where such information is provided by telephone, even 
the ability to use a voice telephone is not an ``essential eligibility 
requirement,'' because Sec. 35.161 requires a public entity to provide 
equally effective telecommunication systems for individuals with 
impaired hearing or speech.
    For other activities, identification of the ``essential eligibility 
requirements'' may be more complex. Where questions of safety are 
involved, the principles established in Sec. 36.208 of the Department's 
regulation implementing title III of the ADA, to be codified at 28 CFR, 
part 36, will be applicable. That section implements section 302(b)(3) 
of the Act, which provides that a public accommodation is not required 
to permit an individual to participate in or benefit from the goods, 
services, facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations of the 
public accommodation, if that individual poses a direct threat to the 
health or safety of others.
    A ``direct threat'' is a significant risk to the health or safety of 
others that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies, 
practices, or procedures, or by the provision of auxiliary aids or 
services. In School Board of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273 
(1987), the Supreme Court recognized that there is a need to balance the 
interests of people with disabilities against legitimate concerns for 
public safety. Although persons with disabilities are generally entitled 
to the protection of this part, a person who poses a significant risk to 
others will not be ``qualified,'' if reasonable modifications to the 
public entity's policies, practices, or procedures will not eliminate 
that risk.
    The determination that a person poses a direct threat to the health 
or safety of others may not be based on generalizations or stereotypes 
about the effects of a particular disability. It must be based on an 
individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on 
current medical evidence or on the best available objective evidence, to 
determine: the nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the 
probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether 
reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures will 
mitigate the risk. This is the test established by the Supreme Court in 
Arline. Such an inquiry is essential if the law is to achieve its goal 
of protecting disabled individuals from discrimination based on 
prejudice, stereotypes, or unfounded fear, while giving appropriate 
weight to legitimate concerns, such as the need to avoid exposing others 
to significant health and safety risks. Making this assessment will not 
usually require the services of a physician. Sources for medical 
knowledge include guidance from public health authorities, such as the 
U.S. Public Health Service, the Centers for Disease Control, and the 
National Institutes of Health, including the National Institute of 
Mental Health.
    ``Qualified interpreter.'' The Department received substantial 
comment regarding the lack of a definition of ``qualified interpreter.'' 
The proposed rule defined auxiliary aids and services to include the 
statutory term, ``qualified interpreters'' (Sec. 35.104), but did not 
define it. Section 35.160 requires the use of auxiliary aids including 
qualified interpreters and commenters stated that a lack of guidance on 
what the term means would create confusion among those trying to secure 
interpreting services and often result in less than effective 
communication.
    Many commenters were concerned that, without clear guidance on the 
issue of ``qualified'' interpreter, the rule would be interpreted to 
mean ``available, rather than qualified'' interpreters. Some claimed 
that few public entities would understand the difference between a 
qualified interpreter and a person who simply knows a few signs or how 
to fingerspell.
    In order to clarify what is meant by ``qualified interpreter'' the 
Department has added a definition of the term to the final rule. A 
qualified interpreter means an interpreter who is able to interpret 
effectively, accurately, and impartially both receptively

[[Page 554]]

and expressively, using any necessary specialized vocabulary. This 
definition focuses on the actual ability of the interpreter in a 
particular interpreting context to facilitate effective communication 
between the public entity and the individual with disabilities.
    Public comment also revealed that public entities have at times 
asked persons who are deaf to provide family members or friends to 
interpret. In certain circumstances, notwithstanding that the family 
member of friend is able to interpret or is a certified interpreter, the 
family member or friend may not be qualified to render the necessary 
interpretation because of factors such as emotional or personal 
involvement or considerations of confidentiality that may adversely 
affect the ability to interpret``effectively, accurately, and 
impartially.''
    The definition of ``qualified interpreter'' in this rule does not 
invalidate or limit standards for interpreting services of any State or 
local law that are equal to or more stringent than those imposed by this 
definition. For instance, the definition would not supersede any 
requirement of State law for use of a certified interpreter in court 
proceedings.
    ``Section 504.'' The Department added a definition of ``section 
504'' because the term is used extensively in subpart F of this part.
    ``State.'' The definition of ``State'' is identical to the statutory 
definition in section 3(3) of the ADA.

                     Section 35.105 Self-evaluation

    Section 35.105 establishes a requirement, based on the section 504 
regulations for federally assisted and federally conducted programs, 
that a public entity evaluate its current policies and practices to 
identify and correct any that are not consistent with the requirements 
of this part. As noted in the discussion of Sec. 35.102, activities 
covered by the Department of Transportation's regulation implementing 
subtitle B of title II are not required to be included in the self-
evaluation required by this section.
    Experience has demonstrated the self-evaluation process to be a 
valuable means of establishing a working relationship with individuals 
with disabilities, which has promoted both effective and efficient 
implementation of section 504. The Department expects that it will 
likewise be useful to public entities newly covered by the ADA.
    All public entities are required to do a self-evaluation. However, 
only those that employ 50 or more persons are required to maintain the 
self-evaluation on file and make it available for public inspection for 
three years. The number 50 was derived from the Department of Justice's 
section 504 regulations for federally assisted programs, 28 CFR 
42.505(c). The Department received comments critical of this limitation, 
some suggesting the requirement apply to all public entities and others 
suggesting that the number be changed from 50 to 15. The final rule has 
not been changed. Although many regulations implementing section 504 for 
federally assisted programs do use 15 employees as the cut-off for this 
record-keeping requirement, the Department believes that it would be 
inappropriate to extend it to those smaller public entities covered by 
this regulation that do not receive Federal financial assistance. This 
approach has the benefit of minimizing paperwork burdens on small 
entities.
    Paragraph (d) provides that the self-evaluation required by this 
section shall apply only to programs not subject to section 504 or those 
policies and practices, such as those involving communications access, 
that have not already been included in a self-evaluation required under 
an existing regulation implementing section 504. Because most self-
evaluations were done from five to twelve years ago, however, the 
Department expects that a great many public entities will be reexamining 
all of their policies and programs. Programs and functions may have 
changed, and actions that were supposed to have been taken to comply 
with section 504 may not have been fully implemented or may no longer be 
effective. In addition, there have been statutory amendments to section 
504 which have changed the coverage of section 504, particularly the 
Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, Public Law No. 100-259, 102 Stat. 
28 (1988), which broadened the definition of a covered ``program or 
activity.''
    Several commenters suggested that the Department clarify public 
entities' liability during the one-year period for compliance with the 
self-evaluation requirement. The self-evaluation requirement does not 
stay the effective date of the statute nor of this part. Public entities 
are, therefore, not shielded from discrimination claims during that 
time.
    Other commenters suggested that the rule require that every self-
evaluation include an examination of training efforts to assure that 
individuals with disabilities are not subjected to discrimination 
because of insensitivity, particularly in the law enforcement area. 
Although the Department has not added such a specific requirement to the 
rule, it would be appropriate for public entities to evaluate training 
efforts because, in many cases, lack of training leads to discriminatory 
practices, even when the policies in place are nondiscriminatory.

                          Section 35.106 Notice

    Section 35.106 requires a public entity to disseminate sufficient 
information to applicants, participants, beneficiaries, and other 
interested persons to inform them of the rights and protections afforded 
by the ADA and this regulation. Methods of providing this information 
include, for example, the publication of information in handbooks, 
manuals, and pamphlets that are distributed

[[Page 555]]

to the public to describe a public entity's programs and activities; the 
display of informative posters in service centers and other public 
places; or the broadcast of information by television or radio. In 
providing the notice, a public entity must comply with the requirements 
for effective communication in Sec. 35.160. The preamble to that 
section gives guidance on how to effectively communicate with 
individuals with disabilities.

   Section 35.107 Designation of Responsible Employee and Adoption of 
                          Grievance Procedures

    Consistent with Sec. 35.105, self-evaluation, the final rule 
requires that public entities with 50 or more employees designate a 
responsible employee and adopt grievance procedures. Most of the 
commenters who suggested that the requirement that self-evaluation be 
maintained on file for three years not be limited to those employing 50 
or more persons made a similar suggestion concerning Sec. 35.107. 
Commenters recommended either that all public entities be subject to 
Sec. 35.107, or that ``50 or more persons'' be changed to ``15 or more 
persons.'' As explained in the discussion of Sec. 35.105, the 
Department has not adopted this suggestion.
    The requirement for designation of an employee responsible for 
coordination of efforts to carry out responsibilities under this part is 
derived from the HEW regulation implementing section 504 in federally 
assisted programs. The requirement for designation of a particular 
employee and dissemination of information about how to locate that 
employee helps to ensure that individuals dealing with large agencies 
are able to easily find a responsible person who is familiar with the 
requirements of the Act and this part and can communicate those 
requirements to other individuals in the agency who may be unaware of 
their responsibilities. This paragraph in no way limits a public 
entity's obligation to ensure that all of its employees comply with the 
requirements of this part, but it ensures that any failure by individual 
employees can be promptly corrected by the designated employee.
    Section 35.107(b) requires public entities with 50 or more employees 
to establish grievance procedures for resolving complaints of violations 
of this part. Similar requirements are found in the section 504 
regulations for federally assisted programs (see, e.g., 45 CFR 84.7(b)). 
The rule, like the regulations for federally assisted programs, provides 
for investigation and resolution of complaints by a Federal enforcement 
agency. It is the view of the Department that public entities subject to 
this part should be required to establish a mechanism for resolution of 
complaints at the local level without requiring the complainant to 
resort to the Federal complaint procedures established under subpart F. 
Complainants would not, however, be required to exhaust the public 
entity's grievance procedures before filing a complaint under subpart F. 
Delay in filing the complaint at the Federal level caused by pursuit of 
the remedies available under the grievance procedure would generally be 
considered good cause for extending the time allowed for filing under 
Sec. 35.170(b).

                     Subpart B--General Requirements

       Section 35.130 General Prohibitions Against Discrimination

    The general prohibitions against discrimination in the rule are 
generally based on the prohibitions in existing regulations implementing 
section 504 and, therefore, are already familiar to State and local 
entities covered by section 504. In addition, Sec. 35.130 includes a 
number of provisions derived from title III of the Act that are implicit 
to a certain degree in the requirements of regulations implementing 
section 504.
    Several commenters suggested that this part should include the 
section of the proposed title III regulation that implemented section 
309 of the Act, which requires that courses and examinations related to 
applications, licensing, certification, or credentialing be provided in 
an accessible place and manner or that alternative accessible 
arrangements be made. The Department has not adopted this suggestion. 
The requirements of this part, including the general prohibitions of 
discrimination in this section, the program access requirements of 
subpart D, and the communications requirements of subpart E, apply to 
courses and examinations provided by public entities. The Department 
considers these requirements to be sufficient to ensure that courses and 
examinations administered by public entities meet the requirements of 
section 309. For example, a public entity offering an examination must 
ensure that modifications of policies, practices, or procedures or the 
provision of auxiliary aids and services furnish the individual with a 
disability an equal opportunity to demonstrate his or her knowledge or 
ability. Also, any examination specially designed for individuals with 
disabilities must be offered as often and in as timely a manner as are 
other examinations. Further, under this part, courses and examinations 
must be offered in the most integrated setting appropriate. The analysis 
of Sec. 35.130(d) is relevant to this determination.
    A number of commenters asked that the regulation be amended to 
require training of law enforcement personnel to recognize the 
difference between criminal activity and the effects of seizures or 
other disabilities such as mental retardation, cerebral palsy, traumatic 
brain injury, mental illness, or deafness. Several disabled commenters 
gave personal statements about the abuse they had

[[Page 556]]

received at the hands of law enforcement personnel. Two organizations 
that commented cited the Judiciary report at 50 as authority to require 
law enforcement training.
    The Department has not added such a training requirement to the 
regulation. Discriminatory arrests and brutal treatment are already 
unlawful police activities. The general regulatory obligation to modify 
policies, practices, or procedures requires law enforcement to make 
changes in policies that result in discriminatory arrests or abuse of 
individuals with disabilities. Under this section law enforcement 
personnel would be required to make appropriate efforts to determine 
whether perceived strange or disruptive behavior or unconsciousness is 
the result of a disability. The Department notes that a number of States 
have attempted to address the problem of arresting disabled persons for 
noncriminal conduct resulting from their disability through adoption of 
the Uniform Duties to Disabled Persons Act, and encourages other 
jurisdictions to consider that approach.
    Paragraph (a) restates the nondiscrimination mandate of section 202 
of the ADA. The remaining paragraphs in Sec. 35.130 establish the 
general principles for analyzing whether any particular action of the 
public entity violates this mandate.
    Paragraph (b) prohibits overt denials of equal treatment of 
individuals with disabilities. A public entity may not refuse to provide 
an individual with a disability with an equal opportunity to participate 
in or benefit from its program simply because the person has a 
disability.
    Paragraph (b)(1)(i) provides that it is discriminatory to deny a 
person with a disability the right to participate in or benefit from the 
aid, benefit, or service provided by a public entity. Paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii) provides that the aids, benefits, and services provided to 
persons with disabilities must be equal to those provided to others, and 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) requires that the aids, benefits, or services 
provided to individuals with disabilities must be as effective in 
affording equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same 
benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as those provided to 
others. These paragraphs are taken from the regulations implementing 
section 504 and simply restate principles long established under section 
504.
    Paragraph (b)(1)(iv) permits the public entity to develop separate 
or different aids, benefits, or services when necessary to provide 
individuals with disabilities with an equal opportunity to participate 
in or benefit from the public entity's programs or activities, but only 
when necessary to ensure that the aids, benefits, or services are as 
effective as those provided to others. Paragraph (b)(1)(iv) must be read 
in conjunction with paragraphs (b)(2), (d), and (e). Even when separate 
or different aids, benefits, or services would be more effective, 
paragraph (b)(2) provides that a qualified individual with a disability 
still has the right to choose to participate in the program that is not 
designed to accommodate individuals with disabilities. Paragraph (d) 
requires that a public entity administer services, programs, and 
activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of 
qualified individuals with disabilities.
    Paragraph (b)(2) specifies that, notwithstanding the existence of 
separate or different programs or activities provided in accordance with 
this section, an individual with a disability shall not be denied the 
opportunity to participate in such programs or activities that are not 
separate or different. Paragraph (e), which is derived from section 
501(d) of the Americans with Disabilities Act, states that nothing in 
this part shall be construed to require an individual with a disability 
to accept an accommodation, aid, service, opportunity, or benefit that 
he or she chooses not to accept.
    Taken together, these provisions are intended to prohibit exclusion 
and segregation of individuals with disabilities and the denial of equal 
opportunities enjoyed by others, based on, among other things, 
presumptions, patronizing attitudes, fears, and stereotypes about 
individuals with disabilities. Consistent with these standards, public 
entities are required to ensure that their actions are based on facts 
applicable to individuals and not on presumptions as to what a class of 
individuals with disabilities can or cannot do.
    Integration is fundamental to the purposes of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act. Provision of segregated accommodations and services 
relegates persons with disabilities to second-class status. For example, 
it would be a violation of this provision to require persons with 
disabilities to eat in the back room of a government cafeteria or to 
refuse to allow a person with a disability the full use of recreation or 
exercise facilities because of stereotypes about the person's ability to 
participate.
    Many commenters objected to proposed paragraphs (b)(1)(iv) and (d) 
as allowing continued segregation of individuals with disabilities. The 
Department recognizes that promoting integration of individuals with 
disabilities into the mainstream of society is an important objective of 
the ADA and agrees that, in most instances, separate programs for 
individuals with disabilities will not be permitted. Nevertheless, 
section 504 does permit separate programs in limited circumstances, and 
Congress clearly intended the regulations issued under title II to adopt 
the standards of section 504. Furthermore, Congress included authority 
for

[[Page 557]]

separate programs in the specific requirements of title III of the Act. 
Section 302(b)(1)(A)(iii) of the Act provides for separate benefits in 
language similar to that in Sec. 35.130(b)(1)(iv), and section 
302(b)(1)(B) includes the same requirement for ``the most integrated 
setting appropriate'' as in Sec. 35.130(d).
    Even when separate programs are permitted, individuals with 
disabilities cannot be denied the opportunity to participate in programs 
that are not separate or different. This is an important and overarching 
principle of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Separate, special, or 
different programs that are designed to provide a benefit to persons 
with disabilities cannot be used to restrict the participation of 
persons with disabilities in general, integrated activities.
    For example, a person who is blind may wish to decline participating 
in a special museum tour that allows persons to touch sculptures in an 
exhibit and instead tour the exhibit at his or her own pace with the 
museum's recorded tour. It is not the intent of this section to require 
the person who is blind to avail himself or herself of the special tour. 
Modified participation for persons with disabilities must be a choice, 
not a requirement.
    In addition, it would not be a violation of this section for a 
public entity to offer recreational programs specially designed for 
children with mobility impairments. However, it would be a violation of 
this section if the entity then excluded these children from other 
recreational services for which they are qualified to participate when 
these services are made available to nondisabled children, or if the 
entity required children with disabilities to attend only designated 
programs.
    Many commenters asked that the Department clarify a public entity's 
obligations within the integrated program when it offers a separate 
program but an individual with a disability chooses not to participate 
in the separate program. It is impossible to make a blanket statement as 
to what level of auxiliary aids or modifications would be required in 
the integrated program. Rather, each situation must be assessed 
individually. The starting point is to question whether the separate 
program is in fact necessary or appropriate for the individual. Assuming 
the separate program would be appropriate for a particular individual, 
the extent to which that individual must be provided with modifications 
in the integrated program will depend not only on what the individual 
needs but also on the limitations and defenses of this part. For 
example, it may constitute an undue burden for a public accommodation, 
which provides a full-time interpreter in its special guided tour for 
individuals with hearing impairments, to hire an additional interpreter 
for those individuals who choose to attend the integrated program. The 
Department cannot identify categorically the level of assistance or aid 
required in the integrated program.
    Paragraph (b)(1)(v) provides that a public entity may not aid or 
perpetuate discrimination against a qualified individual with a 
disability by providing significant assistance to an agency, 
organization, or person that discriminates on the basis of disability in 
providing any aid, benefit, or service to beneficiaries of the public 
entity's program. This paragraph is taken from the regulations 
implementing section 504 for federally assisted programs.
    Paragraph (b)(1)(vi) prohibits the public entity from denying a 
qualified individual with a disability the opportunity to participate as 
a member of a planning or advisory board.
    Paragraph (b)(1)(vii) prohibits the public entity from limiting a 
qualified individual with a disability in the enjoyment of any right, 
privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving any 
aid, benefit, or service.
    Paragraph (b)(3) prohibits the public entity from utilizing criteria 
or methods of administration that deny individuals with disabilities 
access to the public entity's services, programs, and activities or that 
perpetuate the discrimination of another public entity, if both public 
entities are subject to common administrative control or are agencies of 
the same State. The phrase ``criteria or methods of administration'' 
refers to official written policies of the public entity and to the 
actual practices of the public entity. This paragraph prohibits both 
blatantly exclusionary policies or practices and nonessential policies 
and practices that are neutral on their face, but deny individuals with 
disabilities an effective opportunity to participate. This standard is 
consistent with the interpretation of section 504 by the U.S. Supreme 
Court in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985). The Court in Choate 
explained that members of Congress made numerous statements during 
passage of section 504 regarding eliminating architectural barriers, 
providing access to transportation, and eliminating discriminatory 
effects of job qualification procedures. The Court then noted: ``These 
statements would ring hollow if the resulting legislation could not 
rectify the harms resulting from action that discriminated by effect as 
well as by design.'' Id. at 297 (footnote omitted).
    Paragraph (b)(4) specifically applies the prohibition enunciated in 
Sec. 35.130(b)(3) to the process of selecting sites for construction of 
new facilities or selecting existing facilities to be used by the public 
entity. Paragraph (b)(4) does not apply to construction of additional 
buildings at an existing site.

[[Page 558]]

    Paragraph (b)(5) prohibits the public entity, in the selection of 
procurement contractors, from using criteria that subject qualified 
individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of 
disability.
    Paragraph (b)(6) prohibits the public entity from discriminating 
against qualified individuals with disabilities on the basis of 
disability in the granting of licenses or certification. A person is a 
``qualified individual with a disability'' with respect to licensing or 
certification if he or she can meet the essential eligibility 
requirements for receiving the license or certification (see Sec. 
35.104).
    A number of commenters were troubled by the phrase ``essential 
eligibility requirements'' as applied to State licensing requirements, 
especially those for health care professions. Because of the variety of 
types of programs to which the definition of ``qualified individual with 
a disability'' applies, it is not possible to use more specific language 
in the definition. The phrase ``essential eligibility requirements,'' 
however, is taken from the definitions in the regulations implementing 
section 504, so caselaw under section 504 will be applicable to its 
interpretation. In Southeastern Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 
397, for example, the Supreme Court held that section 504 does not 
require an institution to ``lower or effect substantial modifications of 
standards to accommodate a handicapped person,'' 442 U.S. at 413, and 
that the school had established that the plaintiff was not ``qualified'' 
because she was not able to ``serve the nursing profession in all 
customary ways,'' id. Whether a particular requirement is ``essential'' 
will, of course, depend on the facts of the particular case.
    In addition, the public entity may not establish requirements for 
the programs or activities of licensees or certified entities that 
subject qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the 
basis of disability. For example, the public entity must comply with 
this requirement when establishing safety standards for the operations 
of licensees. In that case the public entity must ensure that standards 
that it promulgates do not discriminate against the employment of 
qualified individuals with disabilities in an impermissible manner.
    Paragraph (b)(6) does not extend the requirements of the Act or this 
part directly to the programs or activities of licensees or certified 
entities themselves. The programs or activities of licensees or 
certified entities are not themselves programs or activities of the 
public entity merely by virtue of the license or certificate.
    Paragraph (b)(7) is a specific application of the requirement under 
the general prohibitions of discrimination that public entities make 
reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures where 
necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability. Section 
302(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the ADA sets out this requirement specifically for 
public accommodations covered by title III of the Act, and the House 
Judiciary Committee Report directs the Attorney General to include those 
specific requirements in the title II regulation to the extent that they 
do not conflict with the regulations implementing section 504. Judiciary 
report at 52.
    Paragraph (b)(8), a new paragraph not contained in the proposed 
rule, prohibits the imposition or application of eligibility criteria 
that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or 
any class of individuals with disabilities from fully and equally 
enjoying any service, program, or activity, unless such criteria can be 
shown to be necessary for the provision of the service, program, or 
activity being offered. This prohibition is also a specific application 
of the general prohibitions of discrimination and is based on section 
302(b)(2)(A)(i) of the ADA. It prohibits overt denials of equal 
treatment of individuals with disabilities, or establishment of 
exclusive or segregative criteria that would bar individuals with 
disabilities from participation in services, benefits, or activities.
    Paragraph (b)(8) also prohibits policies that unnecessarily impose 
requirements or burdens on individuals with disabilities that are not 
placed on others. For example, public entities may not require that a 
qualified individual with a disability be accompanied by an attendant. A 
public entity is not, however, required to provide attendant care, or 
assistance in toileting, eating, or dressing to individuals with 
disabilities, except in special circumstances, such as where the 
individual is an inmate of a custodial or correctional institution.
    In addition, paragraph (b)(8) prohibits the imposition of criteria 
that ``tend to'' screen out an individual with a disability. This 
concept, which is derived from current regulations under section 504 
(see, e.g., 45 CFR 84.13), makes it discriminatory to impose policies or 
criteria that, while not creating a direct bar to individuals with 
disabilities, indirectly prevent or limit their ability to participate. 
For example, requiring presentation of a driver's license as the sole 
means of identification for purposes of paying by check would violate 
this section in situations where, for example, individuals with severe 
vision impairments or developmental disabilities or epilepsy are 
ineligible to receive a driver's license and the use of an alternative 
means of identification, such as another photo I.D. or credit card, is 
feasible.
    A public entity may, however, impose neutral rules and criteria that 
screen out, or tend to screen out, individuals with disabilities if the 
criteria are necessary for the safe operation of the program in 
question. Examples of safety qualifications that would be justifiable in 
appropriate circumstances

[[Page 559]]

would include eligibility requirements for drivers' licenses, or a 
requirement that all participants in a recreational rafting expedition 
be able to meet a necessary level of swimming proficiency. Safety 
requirements must be based on actual risks and not on speculation, 
stereotypes, or generalizations about individuals with disabilities.
    Paragraph (c) provides that nothing in this part prohibits a public 
entity from providing benefits, services, or advantages to individuals 
with disabilities, or to a particular class of individuals with 
disabilities, beyond those required by this part. It is derived from a 
provision in the section 504 regulations that permits programs conducted 
pursuant to Federal statute or Executive order that are designed to 
benefit only individuals with disabilities or a given class of 
individuals with disabilities to be limited to those individuals with 
disabilities. Section 504 ensures that federally assisted programs are 
made available to all individuals, without regard to disabilities, 
unless the Federal program under which the assistance is provided is 
specifically limited to individuals with disabilities or a particular 
class of individuals with disabilities. Because coverage under this part 
is not limited to federally assisted programs, paragraph (c) has been 
revised to clarify that State and local governments may provide special 
benefits, beyond those required by the nondiscrimination requirements of 
this part, that are limited to individuals with disabilities or a 
particular class of individuals with disabilities, without thereby 
incurring additional obligations to persons without disabilities or to 
other classes of individuals with disabilities.
    Paragraphs (d) and (e), previously referred to in the discussion of 
paragraph (b)(1)(iv), provide that the public entity must administer 
services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting 
appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities, 
i.e., in a setting that enables individuals with disabilities to 
interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible, and 
that persons with disabilities must be provided the option of declining 
to accept a particular accommodation.
    Some commenters expressed concern that Sec. 35.130(e), which states 
that nothing in the rule requires an individual with a disability to 
accept special accommodations and services provided under the ADA, could 
be interpreted to allow guardians of infants or older people with 
disabilities to refuse medical treatment for their wards. Section 
35.130(e) has been revised to make it clear that paragraph (e) is 
inapplicable to the concern of the commenters. A new paragraph (e)(2) 
has been added stating that nothing in the regulation authorizes the 
representative or guardian of an individual with a disability to decline 
food, water, medical treatment, or medical services for that individual. 
New paragraph (e) clarifies that neither the ADA nor the regulation 
alters current Federal law ensuring the rights of incompetent 
individuals with disabilities to receive food, water, and medical 
treatment. See, e.g., Child Abuse Amendments of 1984 (42 U.S.C. 
5106a(b)(10), 5106g(10)); Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 
U.S.C. 794); the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights 
Act (42 U.S.C. 6042).
    Sections 35.130(e) (1) and (2) are based on section 501(d) of the 
ADA. Section 501(d) was designed to clarify that nothing in the ADA 
requires individuals with disabilities to accept special accommodations 
and services for individuals with disabilities that may segregate them:
    The Committee added this section [501(d)] to clarify that nothing in 
the ADA is intended to permit discriminatory treatment on the basis of 
disability, even when such treatment is rendered under the guise of 
providing an accommodation, service, aid or benefit to the individual 
with disability. For example, a blind individual may choose not to avail 
himself or herself of the right to go to the front of a line, even if a 
particular public accommodation has chosen to offer such a modification 
of a policy for blind individuals. Or, a blind individual may choose to 
decline to participate in a special museum tour that allows persons to 
touch sculptures in an exhibit and instead tour the exhibits at his or 
her own pace with the museum's recorded tour.

Judiciary report at 71-72. The Act is not to be construed to mean that 
an individual with disabilities must accept special accommodations and 
services for individuals with disabilities when that individual can 
participate in the regular services already offered. Because medical 
treatment, including treatment for particular conditions, is not a 
special accommodation or service for individuals with disabilities under 
section 501(d), neither the Act nor this part provides affirmative 
authority to suspend such treatment. Section 501(d) is intended to 
clarify that the Act is not designed to foster discrimination through 
mandatory acceptance of special services when other alternatives are 
provided; this concern does not reach to the provision of medical 
treatment for the disabling condition itself.
    Paragraph (f) provides that a public entity may not place a 
surcharge on a particular individual with a disability, or any group of 
individuals with disabilities, to cover any costs of measures required 
to provide that individual or group with the nondiscriminatory treatment 
required by the Act or this part. Such measures may include the 
provision of auxiliary aids or of modifications required to provide 
program accessibility.
    Several commenters asked for clarification that the costs of 
interpreter services may not be assessed as an element of ``court

[[Page 560]]

costs.'' The Department has already recognized that imposition of the 
cost of courtroom interpreter services is impermissible under section 
504. The preamble to the Department's section 504 regulation for its 
federally assisted programs states that where a court system has an 
obligation to provide qualified interpreters, ``it has the corresponding 
responsibility to pay for the services of the interpreters.'' (45 FR 
37630 (June 3, 1980)). Accordingly, recouping the costs of interpreter 
services by assessing them as part of court costs would also be 
prohibited.
    Paragraph (g), which prohibits discrimination on the basis of an 
individual's or entity's known relationship or association with an 
individual with a disability, is based on sections 102(b)(4) and 
302(b)(1)(E) of the ADA. This paragraph was not contained in the 
proposed rule. The individuals covered under this paragraph are any 
individuals who are discriminated against because of their known 
association with an individual with a disability. For example, it would 
be a violation of this paragraph for a local government to refuse to 
allow a theater company to use a school auditorium on the grounds that 
the company had recently performed for an audience of individuals with 
HIV disease.
    This protection is not limited to those who have a familial 
relationship with the individual who has a disability. Congress 
considered, and rejected, amendments that would have limited the scope 
of this provision to specific associations and relationships. Therefore, 
if a public entity refuses admission to a person with cerebral palsy and 
his or her companions, the companions have an independent right of 
action under the ADA and this section.
    During the legislative process, the term ``entity'' was added to 
section 302(b)(1)(E) to clarify that the scope of the provision is 
intended to encompass not only persons who have a known association with 
a person with a disability, but also entities that provide services to 
or are otherwise associated with such individuals. This provision was 
intended to ensure that entities such as health care providers, 
employees of social service agencies, and others who provide 
professional services to persons with disabilities are not subjected to 
discrimination because of their professional association with persons 
with disabilities.

                   Section 35.131 Illegal Use of Drugs

    Section 35.131 effectuates section 510 of the ADA, which clarifies 
the Act's application to people who use drugs illegally. Paragraph (a) 
provides that this part does not prohibit discrimination based on an 
individual's current illegal use of drugs.
    The Act and the regulation distinguish between illegal use of drugs 
and the legal use of substances, whether or not those substances are 
``controlled substances,'' as defined in the Controlled Substances Act 
(21 U.S.C. 812). Some controlled substances are prescription drugs that 
have legitimate medical uses. Section 35.131 does not affect use of 
controlled substances pursuant to a valid prescription under supervision 
by a licensed health care professional, or other use that is authorized 
by the Controlled Substances Act or any other provision of Federal law. 
It does apply to illegal use of those substances, as well as to illegal 
use of controlled substances that are not prescription drugs. The key 
question is whether the individual's use of the substance is illegal, 
not whether the substance has recognized legal uses. Alcohol is not a 
controlled substance, so use of alcohol is not addressed by Sec. 35.131 
(although alcoholics are individuals with disabilities, subject to the 
protections of the statute).
    A distinction is also made between the use of a substance and the 
status of being addicted to that substance. Addiction is a disability, 
and addicts are individuals with disabilities protected by the Act. The 
protection, however, does not extend to actions based on the illegal use 
of the substance. In other words, an addict cannot use the fact of his 
or her addiction as a defense to an action based on illegal use of 
drugs. This distinction is not artificial. Congress intended to deny 
protection to people who engage in the illegal use of drugs, whether or 
not they are addicted, but to provide protection to addicts so long as 
they are not currently using drugs.
    A third distinction is the difficult one between current use and 
former use. The definition of ``current illegal use of drugs'' in Sec. 
35.104, which is based on the report of the Conference Committee, H.R. 
Conf. Rep. No. 596, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 64 (1990) (hereinafter 
``Conference report''), is ``illegal use of drugs that occurred recently 
enough to justify a reasonable belief that a person's drug use is 
current or that continuing use is a real and ongoing problem.''
    Paragraph (a)(2)(i) specifies that an individual who has 
successfully completed a supervised drug rehabilitation program or has 
otherwise been rehabilitated successfully and who is not engaging in 
current illegal use of drugs is protected. Paragraph (a)(2)(ii) 
clarifies that an individual who is currently participating in a 
supervised rehabilitation program and is not engaging in current illegal 
use of drugs is protected. Paragraph (a)(2)(iii) provides that a person 
who is erroneously regarded as engaging in current illegal use of drugs, 
but who is not engaging in such use, is protected.
    Paragraph (b) provides a limited exception to the exclusion of 
current illegal users of drugs from the protections of the Act. It 
prohibits denial of health services, or services provided in connection 
with drug rehabilitation to an individual on the basis of current

[[Page 561]]

illegal use of drugs, if the individual is otherwise entitled to such 
services. A health care facility, such as a hospital or clinic, may not 
refuse treatment to an individual in need of the services it provides on 
the grounds that the individual is illegally using drugs, but it is not 
required by this section to provide services that it does not ordinarily 
provide. For example, a health care facility that specializes in a 
particular type of treatment, such as care of burn victims, is not 
required to provide drug rehabilitation services, but it cannot refuse 
to treat an individual's burns on the grounds that the individual is 
illegally using drugs.
    Some commenters pointed out that abstention from the use of drugs is 
an essential condition of participation in some drug rehabilitation 
programs, and may be a necessary requirement in inpatient or residential 
settings. The Department believes that this comment is well-founded. 
Congress clearly intended to prohibit exclusion from drug treatment 
programs of the very individuals who need such programs because of their 
use of drugs, but, once an individual has been admitted to a program, 
abstention may be a necessary and appropriate condition to continued 
participation. The final rule therefore provides that a drug 
rehabilitation or treatment program may prohibit illegal use of drugs by 
individuals while they are participating in the program.
    Paragraph (c) expresses Congress' intention that the Act be neutral 
with respect to testing for illegal use of drugs. This paragraph 
implements the provision in section 510(b) of the Act that allows 
entities ``to adopt or administer reasonable policies or procedures, 
including but not limited to drug testing,'' that ensure that an 
individual who is participating in a supervised rehabilitation program, 
or who has completed such a program or otherwise been rehabilitated 
successfully is no longer engaging in the illegal use of drugs. The 
section is not to be ``construed to encourage, prohibit, restrict, or 
authorize the conducting of testing for the illegal use of drugs.''
    Paragraph 35.131(c) clarifies that it is not a violation of this 
part to adopt or administer reasonable policies or procedures to ensure 
that an individual who formerly engaged in the illegal use of drugs is 
not currently engaging in illegal use of drugs. Any such policies or 
procedures must, of course, be reasonable, and must be designed to 
identify accurately the illegal use of drugs. This paragraph does not 
authorize inquiries, tests, or other procedures that would disclose use 
of substances that are not controlled substances or are taken under 
supervision by a licensed health care professional, or other uses 
authorized by the Controlled Substances Act or other provisions of 
Federal law, because such uses are not included in the definition of 
``illegal use of drugs.'' A commenter argued that the rule should permit 
testing for lawful use of prescription drugs, but most commenters 
preferred that tests must be limited to unlawful use in order to avoid 
revealing the lawful use of prescription medicine used to treat 
disabilities.

                         Section 35.132 Smoking

    Section 35.132 restates the clarification in section 501(b) of the 
Act that the Act does not preclude the prohibition of, or imposition of 
restrictions on, smoking in transportation covered by title II. Some 
commenters argued that this section is too limited in scope, and that 
the regulation should prohibit smoking in all facilities used by public 
entities. The reference to smoking in section 501, however, merely 
clarifies that the Act does not require public entities to accommodate 
smokers by permitting them to smoke in transportation facilities.

            Section 35.133 Maintenance of Accessible Features

    Section 35.133 provides that a public entity shall maintain in 
operable working condition those features of facilities and equipment 
that are required to be readily accessible to and usable by persons with 
disabilities by the Act or this part. The Act requires that, to the 
maximum extent feasible, facilities must be accessible to, and usable 
by, individuals with disabilities. This section recognizes that it is 
not sufficient to provide features such as accessible routes, elevators, 
or ramps, if those features are not maintained in a manner that enables 
individuals with disabilities to use them. Inoperable elevators, locked 
accessible doors, or ``accessible'' routes that are obstructed by 
furniture, filing cabinets, or potted plants are neither ``accessible 
to'' nor ``usable by'' individuals with disabilities.
    Some commenters objected that this section appeared to establish an 
absolute requirement and suggested that language from the preamble be 
included in the text of the regulation. It is, of course, impossible to 
guarantee that mechanical devices will never fail to operate. Paragraph 
(b) of the final regulation provides that this section does not prohibit 
isolated or temporary interruptions in service or access due to 
maintenance or repairs. This paragraph is intended to clarify that 
temporary obstructions or isolated instances of mechanical failure would 
not be considered violations of the Act or this part. However, allowing 
obstructions or ``out of service'' equipment to persist beyond a 
reasonable period of time would violate this part, as would repeated 
mechanical failures due to improper or inadequate maintenance. Failure 
of the public entity to ensure that accessible routes are

[[Page 562]]

properly maintained and free of obstructions, or failure to arrange 
prompt repair of inoperable elevators or other equipment intended to 
provide access would also violate this part.
    Other commenters requested that this section be expanded to include 
specific requirements for inspection and maintenance of equipment, for 
training staff in the proper operation of equipment, and for maintenance 
of specific items. The Department believes that this section properly 
establishes the general requirement for maintaining access and that 
further details are not necessary.

                 Section 35.134 Retaliation or Coercion

    Section 35.134 implements section 503 of the ADA, which prohibits 
retaliation against any individual who exercises his or her rights under 
the Act. This section is unchanged from the proposed rule. Paragraph (a) 
of Sec. 35.134 provides that no private or public entity shall 
discriminate against any individual because that individual has 
exercised his or her right to oppose any act or practice made unlawful 
by this part, or because that individual made a charge, testified, 
assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, 
or hearing under the Act or this part.
    Paragraph (b) provides that no private or public entity shall 
coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with any individual in the 
exercise of his or her rights under this part or because that individual 
aided or encouraged any other individual in the exercise or enjoyment of 
any right granted or protected by the Act or this part.
    This section protects not only individuals who allege a violation of 
the Act or this part, but also any individuals who support or assist 
them. This section applies to all investigations or proceedings 
initiated under the Act or this part without regard to the ultimate 
resolution of the underlying allegations. Because this section prohibits 
any act of retaliation or coercion in response to an individual's effort 
to exercise rights established by the Act and this part (or to support 
the efforts of another individual), the section applies not only to 
public entities subject to this part, but also to persons acting in an 
individual capacity or to private entities. For example, it would be a 
violation of the Act and this part for a private individual to harass or 
intimidate an individual with a disability in an effort to prevent that 
individual from attending a concert in a State-owned park. It would, 
likewise, be a violation of the Act and this part for a private entity 
to take adverse action against an employee who appeared as a witness on 
behalf of an individual who sought to enforce the Act.

              Section 35.135 Personal Devices and Services

    The final rule includes a new Sec. 35.135, entitles ``Personal 
devices and services,'' which states that the provision of personal 
devices and services is not required by title II. This new section, 
which serves as a limitation on all of the requirements of the 
regulation, replaces Sec. 35.160(b)(2) of the proposed rule, which 
addressed the issue of personal devices and services explicitly only in 
the context of communications. The personal devices and services 
limitation was intended to have general application in the proposed rule 
in all contexts where it was relevant. The final rule, therefore, 
clarifies this point by including a general provision that will 
explicitly apply not only to auxiliary aids and services but across-the-
board to include other relevant areas such as, for example, 
modifications in policies, practices, and procedures (Sec. 
35.130(b)(7)). The language of Sec. 35.135 parallels an analogous 
provision in the Department's title III regulations (28 CFR 36.306) but 
preserves the explicit reference to ``readers for personal use or 
study'' in Sec. 35.160(b)(2) of the proposed rule. This section does 
not preclude the short-term loan of personal receivers that are part of 
an assistive listening system.

                          Subpart C--Employment

           Section 35.140 Employment Discrimination Prohibited

    Title II of the ADA applies to all activities of public entities, 
including their employment practices. The proposed rule cross-referenced 
the definitions, requirements, and procedures of title I of the ADA, as 
established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR 
part 1630. This proposal would have resulted in use, under Sec. 35.140, 
of the title I definition of ``employer,'' so that a public entity with 
25 or more employees would have become subject to the requirements of 
Sec. 35.140 on July 26, 1992, one with 15 to 24 employees on July 26, 
1994, and one with fewer than 15 employees would have been excluded 
completely.
    The Department received comments objecting to this approach. The 
commenters asserted that Congress intended to establish 
nondiscrimination requirements for employment by all public entities, 
including those that employ fewer than 15 employees; and that Congress 
intended the employment requirements of title II to become effective at 
the same time that the other requirements of this regulation become 
effective, January 26, 1992. The Department has reexamined the statutory 
language and legislative history of the ADA on this issue and has 
concluded that Congress intended to cover the employment practices of 
all public entities and that the applicable effective date is that of 
title II.

[[Page 563]]

    The statutory language of section 204(b) of the ADA requires the 
Department to issue a regulation that is consistent with the ADA and the 
Department's coordination regulation under section 504, 28 CFR part 41. 
The coordination regulation specifically requires nondiscrimination in 
employment, 28 CFR 41.52-41.55, and does not limit coverage based on 
size of employer. Moreover, under all section 504 implementing 
regulations issued in accordance with the Department's coordination 
regulation, employment coverage under section 504 extends to all 
employers with federally assisted programs or activities, regardless of 
size, and the effective date for those employment requirements has 
always been the same as the effective date for nonemployment 
requirements established in the same regulations. The Department 
therefore concludes that Sec. 35.140 must apply to all public entities 
upon the effective date of this regulation.
    In the proposed regulation the Department cross-referenced the 
regulations implementing title I of the ADA, issued by the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission at 29 CFR part 1630, as a compliance 
standard for Sec. 35.140 because, as proposed, the scope of coverage 
and effective date of coverage under title II would have been 
coextensive with title I. In the final regulation this language is 
modified slightly. Subparagraph (1) of new paragraph (b) makes it clear 
that the standards established by the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission in 29 CFR part 1630 will be the applicable compliance 
standards if the public entity is subject to title I. If the public 
entity is not covered by title I, or until it is covered by title I, 
subparagraph (b)(2) cross-references section 504 standards for what 
constitutes employment discrimination, as established by the Department 
of Justice in 28 CFR part 41. Standards for title I of the ADA and 
section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act are for the most part identical 
because title I of the ADA was based on requirements set forth in 
regulations implementing section 504.
    The Department, together with the other Federal agencies responsible 
for the enforcement of Federal laws prohibiting employment 
discrimination on the basis of disability, recognizes the potential for 
jurisdictional overlap that exists with respect to coverage of public 
entities and the need to avoid problems related to overlapping coverage. 
The other Federal agencies include the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission, which is the agency primarily responsible for enforcement of 
title I of the ADA, the Department of Labor, which is the agency 
responsible for enforcement of section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 
1973, and 26 Federal agencies with programs of Federal financial 
assistance, which are responsible for enforcing section 504 in those 
programs. Section 107 of the ADA requires that coordination mechanisms 
be developed in connection with the administrative enforcement of 
complaints alleging discrimination under title I and complaints alleging 
discrimination in employment in violation of the Rehabilitation Act. 
Although the ADA does not specifically require inclusion of employment 
complaints under title II in the coordinating mechanisms required by 
title I, Federal investigations of title II employment complaints will 
be coordinated on a government-wide basis also. The Department is 
currently working with the EEOC and other affected Federal agencies to 
develop effective coordinating mechanisms, and final regulations on this 
issue will be issued on or before January 26, 1992.

                    Subpart D--Program Accessibility

                Section 35.149 Discrimination Prohibited

    Section 35.149 states the general nondiscrimination principle 
underlying the program accessibility requirements of Sec. Sec. 35.150 
and 35.151.

                   Section 35.150 Existing Facilities

    Consistent with section 204(b) of the Act, this regulation adopts 
the program accessibility concept found in the section 504 regulations 
for federally conducted programs or activities (e.g., 28 CFR part 39). 
The concept of ``program accessibility'' was first used in the section 
504 regulation adopted by the Department of Health, Education, and 
Welfare for its federally assisted programs and activities in 1977. It 
allowed recipients to make their federally assisted programs and 
activities available to individuals with disabilities without extensive 
retrofitting of their existing buildings and facilities, by offering 
those programs through alternative methods. Program accessibility has 
proven to be a useful approach and was adopted in the regulations issued 
for programs and activities conducted by Federal Executive agencies. The 
Act provides that the concept of program access will continue to apply 
with respect to facilities now in existence, because the cost of 
retrofitting existing facilities is often prohibitive.
    Section 35.150 requires that each service, program, or activity 
conducted by a public entity, when viewed in its entirety, be readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. The 
regulation makes clear, however, that a public entity is not required to 
make each of its existing facilities accessible (Sec. 35.150(a)(1)). 
Unlike title III of the Act, which requires public accommodations to 
remove architectural barriers where such removal is ``readily 
achievable,'' or to provide goods and services through alternative 
methods, where those methods are ``readily achievable,'' title II 
requires a public entity to make its programs accessible in all cases, 
except where to do so would result

[[Page 564]]

in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program or in undue 
financial and administrative burdens. Congress intended the ``undue 
burden'' standard in title II to be significantly higher than the 
``readily achievable'' standard in title III. Thus, although title II 
may not require removal of barriers in some cases where removal would be 
required under title III, the program access requirement of title II 
should enable individuals with disabilities to participate in and 
benefit from the services, programs, or activities of public entities in 
all but the most unusual cases.
    Paragraph (a)(2), which establishes a special limitation on the 
obligation to ensure program accessibility in historic preservation 
programs, is discussed below in connection with paragraph (b).
    Paragraph (a)(3), which is taken from the section 504 regulations 
for federally conducted programs, generally codifies case law that 
defines the scope of the public entity's obligation to ensure program 
accessibility. This paragraph provides that, in meeting the program 
accessibility requirement, a public entity is not required to take any 
action that would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of 
its service, program, or activity or in undue financial and 
administrative burdens. A similar limitation is provided in Sec. 
35.164.
    This paragraph does not establish an absolute defense; it does not 
relieve a public entity of all obligations to individuals with 
disabilities. Although a public entity is not required to take actions 
that would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a 
service, program, or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens, it nevertheless must take any other steps necessary to ensure 
that individuals with disabilities receive the benefits or services 
provided by the public entity.
    It is the Department's view that compliance with Sec. 35.150(a), 
like compliance with the corresponding provisions of the section 504 
regulations for federally conducted programs, would in most cases not 
result in undue financial and administrative burdens on a public entity. 
In determining whether financial and administrative burdens are undue, 
all public entity resources available for use in the funding and 
operation of the service, program, or activity should be considered. The 
burden of proving that compliance with paragraph (a) of Sec. 35.150 
would fundamentally alter the nature of a service, program, or activity 
or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens rests with 
the public entity.
    The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or 
burdens must be made by the head of the public entity or his or her 
designee and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons 
for reaching that conclusion. The Department recognizes the difficulty 
of identifying the official responsible for this determination, given 
the variety of organizational forms that may be taken by public entities 
and their components. The intention of this paragraph is that the 
determination must be made by a high level official, no lower than a 
Department head, having budgetary authority and responsibility for 
making spending decisions.
    Any person who believes that he or she or any specific class of 
persons has been injured by the public entity head's decision or failure 
to make a decision may file a complaint under the compliance procedures 
established in subpart F.
    Paragraph (b)(1) sets forth a number of means by which program 
accessibility may be achieved, including redesign of equipment, 
reassignment of services to accessible buildings, and provision of 
aides.
    The Department wishes to clarify that, consistent with longstanding 
interpretation of section 504, carrying an individual with a disability 
is considered an ineffective and therefore an unacceptable method for 
achieving program accessibility. Department of Health, Education, and 
Welfare, Office of Civil Rights, Policy Interpretation No. 4, 43 FR 
36035 (August 14, 1978). Carrying will be permitted only in manifestly 
exceptional cases, and only if all personnel who are permitted to 
participate in carrying an individual with a disability are formally 
instructed on the safest and least humiliating means of carrying. 
``Manifestly exceptional'' cases in which carrying would be permitted 
might include, for example, programs conducted in unique facilities, 
such as an oceanographic vessel, for which structural changes and 
devices necessary to adapt the facility for use by individuals with 
mobility impairments are unavailable or prohibitively expensive. 
Carrying is not permitted as an alternative to structural modifications 
such as installation of a ramp or a chairlift.
    In choosing among methods, the public entity shall give priority 
consideration to those that will be consistent with provision of 
services in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of 
individuals with disabilities. Structural changes in existing facilities 
are required only when there is no other feasible way to make the public 
entity's program accessible. (It should be noted that ``structural 
changes'' include all physical changes to a facility; the term does not 
refer only to changes to structural features, such as removal of or 
alteration to a load-bearing structural member.) The requirements of 
Sec. 35.151 for alterations apply to structural changes undertaken to 
comply with this section. The public entity may comply with the program 
accessibility requirement by delivering services at alternate accessible 
sites or making home visits as appropriate.

                     Historic Preservation Programs

    In order to avoid possible conflict between the congressional 
mandates to preserve historic properties, on the one hand, and to 
eliminate discrimination against individuals with disabilities on the 
other, paragraph (a)(2) provides that a public entity is not required to 
take any action that would threaten or destroy the historic significance 
of an historic property. The special limitation on program accessibility 
set forth in paragraph (a)(2) is applicable only to historic 
preservation programs, as defined in Sec. 35.104, that is, programs 
that have preservation of historic properties as a primary purpose. 
Narrow application of the special limitation is justified because of the 
inherent flexibility of the program accessibility requirement. Where 
historic preservation is not a primary purpose of the program, the 
public entity is not required to use a particular facility. It can 
relocate all or part of its program to an accessible facility, make home 
visits, or use other standard methods of achieving program accessibility 
without making structural alterations that might threaten or destroy 
significant historic features of the historic property. Thus, government 
programs located in historic properties, such as an historic State 
capitol, are not excused from the requirement for program access.
    Paragraph (a)(2), therefore, will apply only to those programs that 
uniquely concern the preservation and experience of the historic 
property itself. Because the primary benefit of an historic preservation 
program is the experience of the historic property, paragraph (b)(2) 
requires the public entity to give priority to methods of providing 
program accessibility that permit individuals with disabilities to have 
physical access to the historic property. This priority on physical 
access may also be viewed as a specific application of the general 
requirement that the public entity administer programs in the most 
integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals 
with disabilities (Sec. 35.130(d)). Only when providing physical access 
would threaten or destroy the historic significance of an historic 
property, or would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of 
the program or in undue financial and administrative burdens, may the 
public entity adopt alternative methods for providing program 
accessibility that do not ensure physical access. Examples of some 
alternative methods are provided in paragraph (b)(2).

                              Time Periods

    Paragraphs (c) and (d) establish time periods for complying with the 
program accessibility requirement. Like the regulations for federally 
assisted programs (e.g., 28 CFR 41.57(b)), paragraph (c) requires the 
public entity to make any necessary structural changes in facilities as 
soon as practicable, but in no event later than three years after the 
effective date of this regulation.
    The proposed rule provided that, aside from structural changes, all 
other necessary steps to achieve compliance with this part must be taken 
within sixty days. The sixty day period was taken from regulations 
implementing section 504, which generally were effective no more than 
thirty days after publication. Because this regulation will not be 
effective until January 26, 1992, the Department has concluded that no 
additional transition period for non-structural changes is necessary, so 
the sixty day period has been omitted in the final rule. Of course, this 
section does not reduce or eliminate any obligations that are already 
applicable to a public entity under section 504.
    Where structural modifications are required, paragraph (d) requires 
that a transition plan be developed by an entity that employs 50 or more 
persons, within six months of the effective date of this regulation. The 
legislative history of title II of the ADA makes it clear that, under 
title II, ``local and state governments are required to provide curb 
cuts on public streets.'' Education and Labor report at 84. As the 
rationale for the provision of curb cuts, the House report explains, 
``The employment, transportation, and public accommodation sections of * 
* * (the ADA) would be meaningless if people who use wheelchairs were 
not afforded the opportunity to travel on and between the streets.'' Id. 
Section 35.151(e), which establishes accessibility requirements for new 
construction and alterations, requires that all newly constructed or 
altered streets, roads, or highways must contain curb ramps or other 
sloped areas at any intersection having curbs or other barriers to entry 
from a street level pedestrian walkway, and all newly constructed or 
altered street level pedestrian walkways must have curb ramps or other 
sloped areas at intersections to streets, roads, or highways. A new 
paragraph (d)(2) has been added to the final rule to clarify the 
application of the general requirement for program accessibility to the 
provision of curb cuts at existing crosswalks. This paragraph requires 
that the transition plan include a schedule for providing curb ramps or 
other sloped areas at existing pedestrian walkways, giving priority to 
walkways serving entities covered by the Act, including State and local 
government offices and facilities, transportation, public 
accommodations, and employers, followed by walkways serving other areas. 
Pedestrian ``walkways'' include locations where access is required for 
use of public transportation, such as bus stops that are not located at 
intersections or crosswalks.
    Similarly, a public entity should provide an adequate number of 
accessible parking

[[Page 566]]

spaces in existing parking lots or garages over which it has 
jurisdiction.
    Paragraph (d)(3) provides that, if a public entity has already 
completed a transition plan required by a regulation implementing 
section 504, the transition plan required by this part will apply only 
to those policies and practices that were not covered by the previous 
transition plan. Some commenters suggested that the transition plan 
should include all aspects of the public entity's operations, including 
those that may have been covered by a previous transition plan under 
section 504. The Department believes that such a duplicative requirement 
would be inappropriate. Many public entities may find, however, that it 
will be simpler to include all of their operations in the transition 
plan than to attempt to identify and exclude specifically those that 
were addressed in a previous plan. Of course, entities covered under 
section 504 are not shielded from their obligations under that statute 
merely because they are included under the transition plan developed 
under this section.

             Section 35.151 New Construction and Alterations

    Section 35.151 provides that those buildings that are constructed or 
altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of a public entity shall be 
designed, constructed, or altered to be readily accessible to and usable 
by individuals with disabilities if the construction was commenced after 
the effective date of this part. Facilities under design on that date 
will be governed by this section if the date that bids were invited 
falls after the effective date. This interpretation is consistent with 
Federal practice under section 504.
    Section 35.151(c) establishes two standards for accessible new 
construction and alteration. Under paragraph (c), design, construction, 
or alteration of facilities in conformance with the Uniform Federal 
Accessibility Standards (UFAS) or with the Americans with Disabilities 
Act Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (hereinafter 
ADAAG) shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of this section 
with respect to those facilities except that, if ADAAG is chosen, the 
elevator exemption contained at Sec. Sec. 36.40l(d) and 36.404 does not 
apply. ADAAG is the standard for private buildings and was issued as 
guidelines by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance 
Board (ATBCB) under title III of the ADA. It has been adopted by the 
Department of Justice and is published as appendix A to the Department's 
title III rule in today's Federal Register. Departures from particular 
requirements of these standards by the use of other methods shall be 
permitted when it is clearly evident that equivalent access to the 
facility or part of the facility is thereby provided. Use of two 
standards is a departure from the proposed rule.
    The proposed rule adopted UFAS as the only interim accessibility 
standard because that standard was referenced by the regulations 
implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act promulgated by most 
Federal funding agencies. It is, therefore, familiar to many State and 
local government entities subject to this rule. The Department, however, 
received many comments objecting to the adoption of UFAS. Commenters 
pointed out that, except for the elevator exemption, UFAS is not as 
stringent as ADAAG. Others suggested that the standard should be the 
same to lessen confusion.
    Section 204(b) of the Act states that title II regulations must be 
consistent not only with section 504 regulations but also with ``this 
Act.'' Based on this provision, the Department has determined that a 
public entity should be entitled to choose to comply either with ADAAG 
or UFAS.
    Public entities who choose to follow ADAAG, however, are not 
entitled to the elevator exemption contained in title III of the Act and 
implemented in the title III regulation at Sec. 36.401(d) for new 
construction and Sec. 36.404 for alterations. Section 303(b) of title 
III states that, with some exceptions, elevators are not required in 
facilities that are less than three stories or have less than 3000 
square feet per story. The section 504 standard, UFAS, contains no such 
exemption. Section 501 of the ADA makes clear that nothing in the Act 
may be construed to apply a lesser standard to public entities than the 
standards applied under section 504. Because permitting the elevator 
exemption would clearly result in application of a lesser standard than 
that applied under section 504, paragraph (c) states that the elevator 
exemption does not apply when public entities choose to follow ADAAG. 
Thus, a two-story courthouse, whether built according to UFAS or ADAAG, 
must be constructed with an elevator. It should be noted that Congress 
did not include an elevator exemption for public transit facilities 
covered by subtitle B of title II, which covers public transportation 
provided by public entities, providing further evidence that Congress 
intended that public buildings have elevators.
    Section 504 of the ADA requires the ATBCB to issue supplemental 
Minimum Guidelines and Requirements for Accessible Design of buildings 
and facilities subject to the Act, including title II. Section 204(c) of 
the ADA provides that the Attorney General shall promulgate regulations 
implementing title II that are consistent with the ATBCB's ADA 
guidelines. The ATBCB has announced its intention to issue title II 
guidelines in the future. The Department anticipates that, after the 
ATBCB's title II guidelines have been published, this rule will be 
amended to adopt new accessibility standards consistent with

[[Page 567]]

the ATBCB's rulemaking. Until that time, however, public entities will 
have a choice of following UFAS or ADAAG, without the elevator 
exemption.
    Existing buildings leased by the public entity after the effective 
date of this part are not required by the regulation to meet 
accessibility standards simply by virtue of being leased. They are 
subject, however, to the program accessibility standard for existing 
facilities in Sec. 35.150. To the extent the buildings are newly 
constructed or altered, they must also meet the new construction and 
alteration requirements of Sec. 35.151.
    The Department received many comments urging that the Department 
require that public entities lease only accessible buildings. Federal 
practice under section 504 has always treated newly leased buildings as 
subject to the existing facility program accessibility standard. Section 
204(b) of the Act states that, in the area of ``program accessibility, 
existing facilities,'' the title II regulations must be consistent with 
section 504 regulations. Thus, the Department has adopted the section 
504 principles for these types of leased buildings. Unlike the 
construction of new buildings where architectural barriers can be 
avoided at little or no cost, the application of new construction 
standards to an existing building being leased raises the same prospect 
of retrofitting buildings as the use of an existing Federal facility, 
and the same program accessibility standard should apply to both owned 
and leased existing buildings. Similarly, requiring that public entities 
only lease accessible space would significantly restrict the options of 
State and local governments in seeking leased space, which would be 
particularly burdensome in rural or sparsely populated areas.
    On the other hand, the more accessible the leased space is, the 
fewer structural modifications will be required in the future for 
particular employees whose disabilities may necessitate barrier removal 
as a reasonable accommodation. Pursuant to the requirements for leased 
buildings contained in the Minimum Guidelines and Requirements for 
Accessible Design published under the Architectural Barriers Act by the 
ATBCB, 36 CFR 1190.34, the Federal Government may not lease a building 
unless it contains (1) One accessible route from an accessible entrance 
to those areas in which the principal activities for which the building 
is leased are conducted, (2) accessible toilet facilities, and (3) 
accessible parking facilities, if a parking area is included within the 
lease (36 CFR 1190.34). Although these requirements are not applicable 
to buildings leased by public entities covered by this regulation, such 
entities are encouraged to look for the most accessible space available 
to lease and to attempt to find space complying at least with these 
minimum Federal requirements.
    Section 35.151(d) gives effect to the intent of Congress, expressed 
in section 504(c) of the Act, that this part recognize the national 
interest in preserving significant historic structures. Commenters 
criticized the Department's use of descriptive terms in the proposed 
rule that are different from those used in the ADA to describe eligible 
historic properties. In addition, some commenters criticized the 
Department's decision to use the concept of ``substantially impairing'' 
the historic features of a property, which is a concept employed in 
regulations implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. 
Those commenters recommended that the Department adopt the criteria of 
``adverse effect'' published by the Advisory Council on Historic 
Preservation under the National Historic Preservation Act, 36 CFR 800.9, 
as the standard for determining whether an historic property may be 
altered.
    The Department agrees with these comments to the extent that they 
suggest that the language of the rule should conform to the language 
employed by Congress in the ADA. A definition of ``historic property,'' 
drawn from section 504 of the ADA, has been added to Sec. 35.104 to 
clarify that the term applies to those properties listed or eligible for 
listing in the National Register of Historic Places, or properties 
designated as historic under State or local law.
    The Department intends that the exception created by this section be 
applied only in those very rare situations in which it is not possible 
to provide access to an historic property using the special access 
provisions established by UFAS and ADAAG. Therefore, paragraph (d)(1) of 
Sec. 35.151 has been revised to clearly state that alterations to 
historic properties shall comply, to the maximum extent feasible, with 
section 4.1.7 of UFAS or section 4.1.7 of ADAAG. Paragraph (d)(2) has 
been revised to provide that, if it has been determined under the 
procedures established in UFAS and ADAAG that it is not feasible to 
provide physical access to an historic property in a manner that will 
not threaten or destroy the historic significance of the property, 
alternative methods of access shall be provided pursuant to the 
requirements of Sec. 35.150.
    In response to comments, the Department has added to the final rule 
a new paragraph (e) setting out the requirements of Sec. 36.151 as 
applied to curb ramps. Paragraph (e) is taken from the statement 
contained in the preamble to the proposed rule that all newly 
constructed or altered streets, roads, and highways must contain curb 
ramps at any intersection having curbs or other barriers to entry from a 
street level pedestrian walkway, and that all newly constructed or 
altered street level pedestrian walkways must have curb ramps at 
intersections to streets, roads, or highways.

                        Subpart E--Communications

                         Section 35.160 General

    Section 35.160 requires the public entity to take such steps as may 
be necessary to ensure that communications with applicants, 
participants, and members of the public with disabilities are as 
effective as communications with others.
    Paragraph (b)(1) requires the public entity to furnish appropriate 
auxiliary aids and services when necessary to afford an individual with 
a disability an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the 
benefits of, the public entity's service, program, or activity. The 
public entity must provide an opportunity for individuals with 
disabilities to request the auxiliary aids and services of their choice. 
This expressed choice shall be given primary consideration by the public 
entity (Sec. 35.160(b)(2)). The public entity shall honor the choice 
unless it can demonstrate that another effective means of communication 
exists or that use of the means chosen would not be required under Sec. 
35.164.
    Deference to the request of the individual with a disability is 
desirable because of the range of disabilities, the variety of auxiliary 
aids and services, and different circumstances requiring effective 
communication. For instance, some courtrooms are now equipped for 
``computer-assisted transcripts,'' which allow virtually instantaneous 
transcripts of courtroom argument and testimony to appear on displays. 
Such a system might be an effective auxiliary aid or service for a 
person who is deaf or has a hearing loss who uses speech to communicate, 
but may be useless for someone who uses sign language.
    Although in some circumstances a notepad and written materials may 
be sufficient to permit effective communication, in other circumstances 
they may not be sufficient. For example, a qualified interpreter may be 
necessary when the information being communicated is complex, or is 
exchanged for a lengthy period of time. Generally, factors to be 
considered in determining whether an interpreter is required include the 
context in which the communication is taking place, the number of people 
involved, and the importance of the communication.
    Several commenters asked that the rule clarify that the provision of 
readers is sometimes necessary to ensure access to a public entity's 
services, programs or activities. Reading devices or readers should be 
provided when necessary for equal participation and opportunity to 
benefit from any governmental service, program, or activity, such as 
reviewing public documents, examining demonstrative evidence, and 
filling out voter registration forms or forms needed to receive public 
benefits. The importance of providing qualified readers for examinations 
administered by public entities is discussed under Sec. 35.130. Reading 
devices and readers are appropriate auxiliary aids and services where 
necessary to permit an individual with a disability to participate in or 
benefit from a service, program, or activity.
    Section 35.160(b)(2) of the proposed rule, which provided that a 
public entity need not furnish individually prescribed devices, readers 
for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature, has 
been deleted in favor of a new section in the final rule on personal 
devices and services (see Sec. 35.135).
    In response to comments, the term ``auxiliary aids and services'' is 
used in place of ``auxiliary aids'' in the final rule. This phrase 
better reflects the range of aids and services that may be required 
under this section.
    A number of comments raised questions about the extent of a public 
entity's obligation to provide access to television programming for 
persons with hearing impairments. Television and videotape programming 
produced by public entities are covered by this section. Access to audio 
portions of such programming may be provided by closed captioning.

      Section 35.161 Telecommunication Devices for the Deaf (TDD's)

    Section 35.161 requires that, where a public entity communicates 
with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, TDD's or equally 
effective telecommunication systems be used to communicate with 
individuals with impaired speech or hearing.
    Problems arise when a public entity which does not have a TDD needs 
to communicate with an individual who uses a TDD or vice versa. Title IV 
of the ADA addresses this problem by requiring establishment of 
telephone relay services to permit communications between individuals 
who communicate by TDD and individuals who communicate by the telephone 
alone. The relay services required by title IV would involve a relay 
operator using both a standard telephone and a TDD to type the voice 
messages to the TDD user and read the TDD messages to the standard 
telephone user.
    Section 204(b) of the ADA requires that the regulation implementing 
title II with respect to communications be consistent with the 
Department's regulation implementing section 504 for its federally 
conducted programs and activities at 28 CFR part 39. Section 35.161, 
which is taken from Sec. 39.160(a)(2) of that regulation, requires the 
use of TDD's or equally effective telecommunication systems for 
communication with people who use TDD's. Of course, where relay 
services, such as those required by title IV of the ADA are available, a 
public entity may use those services to meet the requirements of this 
section.
    Many commenters were concerned that public entities should not rely 
heavily on the

[[Page 569]]

establishment of relay services. The commenters explained that while 
relay services would be of vast benefit to both public entities and 
individuals who use TDD's, the services are not sufficient to provide 
access to all telephone services. First, relay systems do not provide 
effective access to the increasingly popular automated systems that 
require the caller to respond by pushing a button on a touch tone phone. 
Second, relay systems cannot operate fast enough to convey messages on 
answering machines, or to permit a TDD user to leave a recorded message. 
Third, communication through relay systems may not be appropriate in 
cases of crisis lines pertaining to rape, domestic violence, child 
abuse, and drugs. The Department believes that it is more appropriate 
for the Federal Communications Commission to address these issues in its 
rulemaking under title IV.
    Some commenters requested that those entities with frequent contacts 
with clients who use TDD's have on-site TDD's to provide for direct 
communication between the entity and the individual. The Department 
encourages those entities that have extensive telephone contact with the 
public such as city halls, public libraries, and public aid offices, to 
have TDD's to insure more immediate access. Where the provision of 
telephone service is a major function of the entity, TDD's should be 
available.

               Section 35.162 Telephone Emergency Services

    Many public entities provide telephone emergency services by which 
individuals can seek immediate assistance from police, fire, ambulance, 
and other emergency services. These telephone emergency services--
including ``911'' services--are clearly an important public service 
whose reliability can be a matter of life or death. The legislative 
history of title II specifically reflects congressional intent that 
public entities must ensure that telephone emergency services, including 
911 services, be accessible to persons with impaired hearing and speech 
through telecommunication technology (Conference report at 67; Education 
and Labor report at 84-85).
    Proposed Sec. 35.162 mandated that public entities provide 
emergency telephone services to persons with disabilities that are 
``functionally equivalent'' to voice services provided to others. Many 
commenters urged the Department to revise the section to make clear that 
direct access to telephone emergency services is required by title II of 
the ADA as indicated by the legislative history (Conference report at 
67-68; Education and Labor report at 85). In response, the final rule 
mandates ``direct access,'' instead of ``access that is functionally 
equivalent'' to that provided to all other telephone users. Telephone 
emergency access through a third party or through a relay service would 
not satisfy the requirement for direct access.
    Several commenters asked about a separate seven-digit emergency call 
number for the 911 services. The requirement for direct access disallows 
the use of a separate seven-digit number where 911 service is available. 
Separate seven-digit emergency call numbers would be unfamiliar to many 
individuals and also more burdensome to use. A standard emergency 911 
number is easier to remember and would save valuable time spent in 
searching in telephone books for a local seven-digit emergency number.
    Many commenters requested the establishment of minimum standards of 
service (e.g., the quantity and location of TDD's and computer modems 
needed in a given emergency center). Instead of establishing these 
scoping requirements, the Department has established a performance 
standard through the mandate for direct access.
    Section 35.162 requires public entities to take appropriate steps, 
including equipping their emergency systems with modern technology, as 
may be necessary to promptly receive and respond to a call from users of 
TDD's and computer modems. Entities are allowed the flexibility to 
determine what is the appropriate technology for their particular needs. 
In order to avoid mandating use of particular technologies that may 
become outdated, the Department has eliminated the references to the 
Baudot and ASCII formats in the proposed rule.
    Some commenters requested that the section require the installation 
of a voice amplification device on the handset of the dispatcher's 
telephone to amplify the dispatcher's voice. In an emergency, a person 
who has a hearing loss may be using a telephone that does not have an 
amplification device. Installation of speech amplification devices on 
the handsets of the dispatchers' telephones would respond to that 
situation. The Department encourages their use.
    Several commenters emphasized the need for proper maintenance of 
TDD's used in telephone emergency services. Section 35.133, which 
mandates maintenance of accessible features, requires public entities to 
maintain in operable working condition TDD's and other devices that 
provide direct access to the emergency system.

                 Section 35.163 Information and Signage

    Section 35.163(a) requires the public entity to provide information 
to individuals with disabilities concerning accessible services, 
activities, and facilities. Paragraph (b) requires the public entity to 
provide signage at all inaccessible entrances to each of its facilities 
that directs users to an accessible entrance or to a location with 
information about accessible facilities.
    Several commenters requested that, where TDD-equipped pay phones or 
portable TDD's

[[Page 570]]

exist, clear signage should be posted indicating the location of the 
TDD. The Department believes that this is required by paragraph (a). In 
addition, the Department recommends that, in large buildings that house 
TDD's, directional signage indicating the location of available TDD's 
should be placed adjacent to banks of telephones that do not contain a 
TDD.

                          Section 35.164 Duties

    Section 35.164, like paragraph (a)(3) of Sec. 35.150, is taken from 
the section 504 regulations for federally conducted programs. Like 
paragraph (a)(3), it limits the obligation of the public entity to 
ensure effective communication in accordance with Davis and the circuit 
court opinions interpreting it. It also includes specific requirements 
for determining the existence of undue financial and administrative 
burdens. The preamble discussion of Sec. 35.150(a) regarding that 
determination is applicable to this section and further explains the 
public entity's obligation to comply with Sec. Sec. 35.160-35.164. 
Because of the essential nature of the services provided by telephone 
emergency systems, the Department assumes that Sec. 35.164 will rarely 
be applied to Sec. 35.162.

                    Subpart F--Compliance Procedures

    Subpart F sets out the procedures for administrative enforcement of 
this part. Section 203 of the Act provides that the remedies, 
procedures, and rights set forth in section 505 of the Rehabilitation 
Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794a) for enforcement of section 504 of the 
Rehabilitation Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of 
handicap in programs and activities that receive Federal financial 
assistance, shall be the remedies, procedures, and rights for 
enforcement of title II. Section 505, in turn, incorporates by reference 
the remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in title VI of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d to 2000d-4a). Title VI, which 
prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin 
in federally assisted programs, is enforced by the Federal agencies that 
provide the Federal financial assistance to the covered programs and 
activities in question. If voluntary compliance cannot be achieved, 
Federal agencies enforce title VI either by the termination of Federal 
funds to a program that is found to discriminate, following an 
administrative hearing, or by a referral to this Department for judicial 
enforcement.
    Title II of the ADA extended the requirements of section 504 to all 
services, programs, and activities of State and local governments, not 
only those that receive Federal financial assistance. The House 
Committee on Education and Labor explained the enforcement provisions as 
follows:
    It is the Committee's intent that administrative enforcement of 
section 202 of the legislation should closely parallel the Federal 
government's experience with section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 
1973. The Attorney General should use section 504 enforcement procedures 
and the Department's coordination role under Executive Order 12250 as 
models for regulation in this area.
    The Committee envisions that the Department of Justice will identify 
appropriate Federal agencies to oversee compliance activities for State 
and local governments. As with section 504, these Federal agencies, 
including the Department of Justice, will receive, investigate, and 
where possible, resolve complaints of discrimination. If a Federal 
agency is unable to resolve a complaint by voluntary means, * * * the 
major enforcement sanction for the Federal government will be referral 
of cases by these Federal agencies to the Department of Justice.
    The Department of Justice may then proceed to file suits in Federal 
district court. As with section 504, there is also a private right of 
action for persons with disabilities, which includes the full panoply of 
remedies. Again, consistent with section 504, it is not the Committee's 
intent that persons with disabilities need to exhaust Federal 
administrative remedies before exercising their private right of action.

Education & Labor report at 98. See also S. Rep. No. 116, 101st Cong., 
1st Sess., at 57-58 (1989).
    Subpart F effectuates the congressional intent by deferring to 
section 504 procedures where those procedures are applicable, that is, 
where a Federal agency has jurisdiction under section 504 by virtue of 
its provision of Federal financial assistance to the program or activity 
in which the discrimination is alleged to have occurred. Deferral to the 
504 procedures also makes the sanction of fund termination available 
where necessary to achieve compliance. Because the Civil Rights 
Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100-259) extended the application of section 
504 to all of the operations of the public entity receiving the Federal 
financial assistance, many activities of State and local governments are 
already covered by section 504. The procedures in subpart F apply to 
complaints concerning services, programs, and activities of public 
entities that are covered by the ADA.
    Subpart G designates the Federal agencies responsible for enforcing 
the ADA with respect to specific components of State and local 
government. It does not, however, displace existing jurisdiction under 
section 504 of the various funding agencies. Individuals may still file 
discrimination complaints against recipients of Federal financial 
assistance with the agencies that provide that assistance, and the 
funding agencies will continue to process those complaints under

[[Page 571]]

their existing procedures for enforcing section 504. The substantive 
standards adopted in this part for title II of the ADA are generally the 
same as those required under section 504 for federally assisted 
programs, and public entities covered by the ADA are also covered by the 
requirements of section 504 to the extent that they receive Federal 
financial assistance. To the extent that title II provides greater 
protection to the rights of individuals with disabilities, however, the 
funding agencies will also apply the substantive requirements 
established under title II and this part in processing complaints 
covered by both this part and section 504, except that fund termination 
procedures may be used only for violations of section 504.
    Subpart F establishes the procedures to be followed by the agencies 
designated in subpart G for processing complaints against State and 
local government entities when the designated agency does not have 
jurisdiction under section 504.

                        Section 35.170 Complaints

    Section 35.170 provides that any individual who believes that he or 
she or a specific class of individuals has been subjected to 
discrimination on the basis of disability by a public entity may, by 
himself or herself or by an authorized representative, file a complaint 
under this part within 180 days of the date of the alleged 
discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by the agency for 
good cause. Although Sec. 35.107 requires public entities that employ 
50 or more persons to establish grievance procedures for resolution of 
complaints, exhaustion of those procedures is not a prerequisite to 
filing a complaint under this section. If a complainant chooses to 
follow the public entity's grievance procedures, however, any resulting 
delay may be considered good cause for extending the time allowed for 
filing a complaint under this part.
    Filing the complaint with any Federal agency will satisfy the 
requirement for timely filing. As explained below, a complaint filed 
with an agency that has jurisdiction under section 504 will be processed 
under the agency's procedures for enforcing section 504.
    Some commenters objected to the complexity of allowing complaints to 
be filed with different agencies. The multiplicity of enforcement 
jurisdiction is the result of following the statutorily mandated 
enforcement scheme. The Department has, however, attempted to simplify 
procedures for complainants by making the Federal agency that receives 
the complaint responsible for referring it to an appropriate agency.
    The Department has also added a new paragraph (c) to this section 
providing that a complaint may be filed with any agency designated under 
subpart G of this part, or with any agency that provides funding to the 
public entity that is the subject of the complaint, or with the 
Department of Justice. Under Sec. 35.171(a)(2), the Department of 
Justice will refer complaints for which it does not have jurisdiction 
under section 504 to an agency that does have jurisdiction under section 
504, or to the agency designated under subpart G as responsible for 
complaints filed against the public entity that is the subject of the 
complaint or in the case of an employment complaint that is also subject 
to title I of the Act, to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 
Complaints filed with the Department of Justice may be sent to the 
Coordination and Review Section, P.O. Box 66118, Civil Rights Division, 
U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20035-6118.

                 Section 35.171 Acceptance of Complaints

    Section 35.171 establishes procedures for determining jurisdiction 
and responsibility for processing complaints against public entities. 
The final rule provides complainants an opportunity to file with the 
Federal funding agency of their choice. If that agency does not have 
jurisdiction under section 504, however, and is not the agency 
designated under subpart G as responsible for that public entity, the 
agency must refer the complaint to the Department of Justice, which will 
be responsible for referring it either to an agency that does have 
jurisdiction under section 504 or to the appropriate designated agency, 
or in the case of an employment complaint that is also subject to title 
I of the Act, to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
    Whenever an agency receives a complaint over which it has 
jurisdiction under section 504, it will process the complaint under its 
section 504 procedures. When the agency designated under subpart G 
receives a complaint for which it does not have jurisdiction under 
section 504, it will treat the complaint as an ADA complaint under the 
procedures established in this subpart.
    Section 35.171 also describes agency responsibilities for the 
processing of employment complaints. As described in connection with 
Sec. 35.140, additional procedures regarding the coordination of 
employment complaints will be established in a coordination regulation 
issued by DOJ and EEOC. Agencies with jurisdiction under section 504 for 
complaints alleging employment discrimination also covered by title I 
will follow the procedures established by the coordination regulation 
for those complaints. Complaints covered by title I but not section 504 
will be referred to the EEOC, and complaints covered by this part but 
not title I will be processed under the procedures in this part.

[[Page 572]]

                 Section 35.172 Resolution of Complaints

    Section 35.172 requires the designated agency to either resolve the 
complaint or issue to the complainant and the public entity a Letter of 
Findings containing findings of fact and conclusions of law and a 
description of a remedy for each violation found.
    The Act requires the Department of Justice to establish 
administrative procedures for resolution of complaints, but does not 
require complainants to exhaust these administrative remedies. The 
Committee Reports make clear that Congress intended to provide a private 
right of action with the full panoply of remedies for individual victims 
of discrimination. Because the Act does not require exhaustion of 
administrative remedies, the complainant may elect to proceed with a 
private suit at any time.

             Section 35.173 Voluntary Compliance Agreements

    Section 35.173 requires the agency to attempt to resolve all 
complaints in which it finds noncompliance through voluntary compliance 
agreements enforceable by the Attorney General.

                         Section 35.174 Referral

    Section 35.174 provides for referral of the matter to the Department 
of Justice if the agency is unable to obtain voluntary compliance.

                     Section 35.175 Attorney's Fees

    Section 35.175 states that courts are authorized to award attorneys 
fees, including litigation expenses and costs, as provided in section 
505 of the Act. Litigation expenses include items such as expert witness 
fees, travel expenses, etc. The Judiciary Committee Report specifies 
that such items are included under the rubric of ``attorneys fees'' and 
not ``costs'' so that such expenses will be assessed against a plaintiff 
only under the standard set forth in Christiansburg Garment Co. v. Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission, 434 U.S. 412 (1978). (Judiciary 
report at 73.)

         Section 35.176 Alternative Means of Dispute Resolution

    Section 35.176 restates section 513 of the Act, which encourages use 
of alternative means of dispute resolution.

     Section 35.177 Effect of Unavailability of Technical Assistance

    Section 35.177 explains that, as provided in section 506(e) of the 
Act, a public entity is not excused from compliance with the 
requirements of this part because of any failure to receive technical 
assistance.

                      Section 35.178 State Immunity

    Section 35.178 restates the provision of section 502 of the Act that 
a State is not immune under the eleventh amendment to the Constitution 
of the United States from an action in Federal or State court for 
violations of the Act, and that the same remedies are available for any 
such violations as are available in an action against an entity other 
than a State.

                     Subpart G--Designated Agencies

                   Section 35.190 Designated Agencies

    Subpart G designates the Federal agencies responsible for 
investigating complaints under this part. At least 26 agencies currently 
administer programs of Federal financial assistance that are subject to 
the nondiscrimination requirements of section 504 as well as other civil 
rights statutes. A majority of these agencies administer modest programs 
of Federal financial assistance and/or devote minimal resources 
exclusively to ``external'' civil rights enforcement activities. Under 
Executive Order 12250, the Department of Justice has encouraged the use 
of delegation agreements under which certain civil rights compliance 
responsibilities for a class of recipients funded by more than one 
agency are delegated by an agency or agencies to a ``lead'' agency. For 
example, many agencies that fund institutions of higher education have 
signed agreements that designate the Department of Education as the 
``lead'' agency for this class of recipients.
    The use of delegation agreements reduces overlap and duplication of 
effort, and thereby strengthens overall civil rights enforcement. 
However, the use of these agreements to date generally has been limited 
to education and health care recipients. These classes of recipients are 
funded by numerous agencies and the logical connection to a lead agency 
is clear (e.g., the Department of Education for colleges and 
universities, and the Department of Health and Human Services for 
hospitals).
    The ADA's expanded coverage of State and local government operations 
further complicates the process of establishing Federal agency 
jurisdiction for the purpose of investigating complaints of 
discrimination on the basis of disability. Because all operations of 
public entities now are covered irrespective of the presence or absence 
of Federal financial assistance, many additional State and local 
government functions and organizations now are subject to Federal 
jurisdiction. In some cases, there is no historical or single clear-cut 
subject matter relationship with a Federal agency as was the case in the 
education example described above. Further, the 33,000 governmental 
jurisdictions subject to the ADA differ greatly in their organization,

[[Page 573]]

making a detailed and workable division of Federal agency jurisdiction 
by individual State, county, or municipal entity unrealistic.
    This regulation applies the delegation concept to the investigation 
of complaints of discrimination on the basis of disability by public 
entities under the ADA. It designates eight agencies, rather than all 
agencies currently administering programs of Federal financial 
assistance, as responsible for investigating complaints under this part. 
These ``designated agencies'' generally have the largest civil rights 
compliance staffs, the most experience in complaint investigations and 
disability issues, and broad yet clear subject area responsibilities. 
This division of responsibilities is made functionally rather than by 
public entity type or name designation. For example, all entities 
(regardless of their title) that exercise responsibilities, regulate, or 
administer services or programs relating to lands and natural resources 
fall within the jurisdiction of the Department of Interior.
    Complaints under this part will be investigated by the designated 
agency most closely related to the functions exercised by the 
governmental component against which the complaint is lodged. For 
example, a complaint against a State medical board, where such a board 
is a recognizable entity, will be investigated by the Department of 
Health and Human Services (the designated agency for regulatory 
activities relating to the provision of health care), even if the board 
is part of a general umbrella department of planning and regulation (for 
which the Department of Justice is the designated agency). If two or 
more agencies have apparent responsibility over a complaint, Sec. 
35.190(c) provides that the Assistant Attorney General shall determine 
which one of the agencies shall be the designated agency for purposes of 
that complaint.
    Thirteen commenters, including four proposed designated agencies, 
addressed the Department of Justice's identification in the proposed 
regulation of nine ``designated agencies'' to investigate complaints 
under this part. Most comments addressed the proposed specific 
delegations to the various individual agencies. The Department of 
Justice agrees with several commenters who pointed out that 
responsibility for ``historic and cultural preservation'' functions 
appropriately belongs with the Department of Interior rather than the 
Department of Education. The Department of Justice also agrees with the 
Department of Education that ``museums'' more appropriately should be 
delegated to the Department of Interior, and that ``preschool and 
daycare programs'' more appropriately should be assigned to the 
Department of Health and Human Services, rather than to the Department 
of Education. The final rule reflects these decisions.
    The Department of Commerce opposed its listing as the designated 
agency for ``commerce and industry, including general economic 
development, banking and finance, consumer protection, insurance, and 
small business''. The Department of Commerce cited its lack of a 
substantial existing section 504 enforcement program and experience with 
many of the specific functions to be delegated. The Department of 
Justice accedes to the Department of Commerce's position, and has 
assigned itself as the designated agency for these functions.
    In response to a comment from the Department of Health and Human 
Services, the regulation's category of ``medical and nursing schools'' 
has been clarified to read ``schools of medicine, dentistry, nursing, 
and other health-related fields''. Also in response to a comment from 
the Department of Health and Human Services, ``correctional 
institutions'' have been specifically added to the public safety and 
administration of justice functions assigned to the Department of 
Justice.
    The regulation also assigns the Department of Justice as the 
designated agency responsible for all State and local government 
functions not assigned to other designated agencies. The Department of 
Justice, under an agreement with the Department of the Treasury, 
continues to receive and coordinate the investigation of complaints 
filed under the Revenue Sharing Act. This entitlement program, which was 
terminated in 1986, provided civil rights compliance jurisdiction for a 
wide variety of complaints regarding the use of Federal funds to support 
various general activities of local governments. In the absence of any 
similar program of Federal financial assistance administered by another 
Federal agency, placement of designated agency responsibilities for 
miscellaneous and otherwise undesignated functions with the Department 
of Justice is an appropriate continuation of current practice.
    The Department of Education objected to the proposed rule's 
inclusion of the functional area of ``arts and humanities'' within its 
responsibilities, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development 
objected to its proposed designation as responsible for activities 
relating to rent control, the real estate industry, and housing code 
enforcement. The Department has deleted these areas from the lists 
assigned to the Departments of Education and Housing and Urban 
Development, respectively, and has added a new paragraph (c) to Sec. 
35.190, which provides that the Department of Justice may assign 
responsibility for components of State or local governments that 
exercise responsibilities, regulate, or administer services, programs, 
or activities relating to functions not assigned to specific designated 
agencies by paragraph (b) of this section to other appropriate agencies. 
The Department believes

[[Page 574]]

that this approach will provide more flexibility in determining the 
appropriate agency for investigation of complaints involving those 
components of State and local governments not specifically addressed by 
the listings in paragraph (b). As provided in Sec. Sec. 35.170 and 
35.171, complaints filed with the Department of Justice will be referred 
to the appropriate agency.
    Several commenters proposed a stronger role for the Department of 
Justice, especially with respect to the receipt and assignment of 
complaints, and the overall monitoring of the effectiveness of the 
enforcement activities of Federal agencies. As discussed above, 
Sec. Sec. 35.170 and 35.171 have been revised to provide for referral 
of complaints by the Department of Justice to appropriate enforcement 
agencies. Also, language has been added to Sec. 35.190(a) of the final 
regulation stating that the Assistant Attorney General shall provide 
policy guidance and interpretations to designated agencies to ensure the 
consistent and effective implementation of this part.

                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 36.101  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to implement title III of the Americans 
with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12181), which prohibits 
discrimination on the basis of disability by public accommodations and 
requires places of public accommodation and commercial facilities to be 
designed, constructed, and altered in compliance with the accessibility 
standards established by this part.


<R05>
Sec. 36.102  Application.

    (a) General. This part applies to any--
    (1) Public accommodation;

(29 U.S.C. 791) or the regulations issued by Federal agencies pursuant 
to that title.
    (b) Section 504. This part does not affect the obligations of a 
recipient of Federal financial assistance to comply with the 
requirements of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 
794) and regulations issued by Federal agencies implementing section 
504.
    (c) Other laws. This part does not invalidate or limit the remedies, 
rights, and procedures of any other Federal laws, or State or local laws 
(including State common law) that provide greater or equal protection 
for the rights of individuals with disabilities or individuals 
associated with them.


<R05>
Sec. 36.104  Definitions.

    For purposes of this part, the term--
    Act means the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-
336, 104 Stat. 327, 42 U.S.C. 12101-12213 and 47 U.S.C. 225 and 611).
    Commerce means travel, trade, traffic, commerce, transportation, or 
communication--
    (1) Among the several States;
    (2) Between any foreign country or any territory or possession and 
any State; or
    (3) Between points in the same State but through another State or 
foreign country.
    Commercial facilities means facilities--
    (1) Whose operations will affect commerce;
    (2) That are intended for nonresidential use by a private entity; 
and
    (3) That are not--
    (i) Facilities that are covered or expressly exempted from coverage 
under the Fair Housing Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 3601-3631);
    (ii) Aircraft; or
    (iii) Railroad locomotives, railroad freight cars, railroad 
cabooses, commuter or intercity passenger rail cars

[[Page 576]]

(including coaches, dining cars, sleeping cars, lounge cars, and food 
service cars), any other railroad cars described in section 242 of the 
Act or covered under title II of the Act, or railroad rights-of-way. For 
purposes of this definition, ``rail'' and ``railroad'' have the meaning 
given the term ``railroad'' in section 202(e) of the Federal Railroad 
Safety Act of 1970 (45 U.S.C. 431(e)).
    Current illegal use of drugs means illegal use of drugs that 
occurred recently enough to justify a reasonable belief that a person's 
drug use is current or that continuing use is a real and ongoing 
problem.
    Disability means, with respect to an individual, a physical or 
mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major 
life activities of such individual; a record of such an impairment; or 
being regarded as having such an impairment.
    (1) The phrase physical or mental impairment means--
    (i) Any physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, 
or anatomical loss affecting one or more of the following body systems: 
neurological; musculoskeletal; special sense organs; respiratory, 
including speech organs; cardiovascular; reproductive; digestive; 
genitourinary; hemic and lymphatic; skin; and endocrine;
    (ii) Any mental or psychological disorder such as mental 
retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and 
specific learning disabilities;
    (iii) The phrase physical or mental impairment includes, but is not 
limited to, such contagious and noncontagious diseases and conditions as 
orthopedic, visual, speech, and hearing impairments, cerebral palsy, 
epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, cancer, heart disease, 
diabetes, mental retardation, emotional illness, specific learning 
disabilities, HIV disease (whether symptomatic or asymptomatic), 
tuberculosis, drug addiction, and alcoholism;
    (iv) The phrase physical or mental impairment does not include 
homosexuality or bisexuality.
    (2) The phrase major life activities means functions such as caring 
for one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, 
speaking, breathing, learning, and working.
    (3) The phrase has a record of such an impairment means has a 
history of, or has been misclassified as having, a mental or physical 
impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.
    (4) The phrase is regarded as having an impairment means--
    (i) Has a physical or mental impairment that does not substantially 
limit major life activities but that is treated by a private entity as 
constituting such a limitation;
    (ii) Has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits 
major life activities only as a result of the attitudes of others toward 
such impairment; or
    (iii) Has none of the impairments defined in paragraph (1) of this 
definition but is treated by a private entity as having such an

<R05>
Sec. 36.205  Association.

    A public accommodation shall not exclude or otherwise deny equal 
goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, accommodations, or

to have a relationship or association.


<R05>
Sec. 36.206  Retaliation or coercion.

[[Page 580]]


<R05>
Sec. 36.207  Places of public accommodation located in private residences.

    (a) When a place of public accommodation is located in a private 
residence, the portion of the residence used exclusively as a residence

of others that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies, 
practices, or procedures, or by the provision of auxiliary aids or 
services.
    (c) In determining whether an individual poses a direct threat to 
the health or safety of others, a public accommodation must make an 
individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on

probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether 
reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures will 
mitigate the risk.

<R05>
Sec. Sec. 36.214-36.299  [Reserved]


<R04>
                     Subpart C_Specific Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 36.301  Eligibility criteria.

    (a) General. A public accommodation shall not impose or apply 
eligibility criteria that screen out or tend to screen out an individual 
with a disability or any class of individuals with disabilities from 
fully and equally enjoying any goods, services, facilities, privileges, 
advantages, or accommodations, unless such criteria can be shown to be 
necessary for the provision of the goods, services, facilities, 
privileges, advantages, or accommodations being offered.
    (b) Safety. A public accommodation may impose legitimate safety 
requirements that are necessary for safe operation. Safety requirements 
must be based on actual risks and not on mere speculation, stereotypes, 
or generalizations about individuals with disabilities.
    (c) Charges. A public accommodation may not impose a surcharge on a 
particular individual with a disability or any group of individuals with 
disabilities to cover the costs of measures, such as the provision of 
auxiliary aids, barrier removal, alternatives to barrier removal, and 
reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, that are 
required to provide that individual or group with the nondiscriminatory 
treatment required by the Act or this part.


<R05>
Sec. 36.302  Modifications in policies, practices, or procedures.

    (a) General. A public accommodation shall make reasonable 
modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, when the 
modifications are necessary to afford goods, services, facilities, 
privileges, advantages, or accommodations to individuals with 
disabilities, unless the public accommodation can demonstrate that 
making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the 
goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations.
    (b) Specialties--(1) General. A public accommodation may refer an 
individual with a disability to another public accommodation, if that 
individual is seeking, or requires, treatment or services outside of the 
referring public accommodation's area of specialization, and if, in the 
normal course of its operations, the referring public accommodation 
would make a similar referral for an individual without a disability who 
seeks or requires the same treatment or services.

[[Page 582]]

    (2) Illustration--medical specialties. A health care provider may 
refer an individual with a disability to another provider, if that 
individual is seeking, or requires, treatment or services outside of the 
referring provider's area of specialization, and if the referring 
provider would make a similar referral for an individual without a 
disability who seeks or requires the same treatment or services. A 
physician who specializes in treating only a particular condition cannot 
refuse to treat an individual with a disability for that condition, but 
is not required to treat the individual for a different condition.
    (c) Service animals--(1) General. Generally, a public accommodation 
shall modify policies, practices, or procedures to permit the use of a 
service animal by an individual with a disability.
    (2) Care or supervision of service animals. Nothing in this part 
requires a public accommodation to supervise or care for a service 
animal.
    (d) Check-out aisles. A store with check-out aisles shall ensure 
that an adequate number of accessible check-out aisles are kept open 
during store hours, or shall otherwise modify its policies and 
practices, in order to ensure that an equivalent level of convenient 
service is provided to individuals with disabilities as is provided to 
others. If only one check-out aisle is accessible, and it is generally 
used for express service, one way of providing equivalent service is to 
allow persons with mobility impairments to make all their purchases at 
that aisle.


<R05>
Sec. 36.303  Auxiliary aids and services.

    (a) General. A public accommodation shall take those steps that may 
be necessary to ensure that no individual with a disability is excluded, 
denied services, segregated or otherwise treated differently than other 
individuals because of the absence of auxiliary aids and services, 
unless the public accommodation can demonstrate that taking those steps 
would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods, services, facilities, 
privileges, advantages, or accommodations being offered or would result 
in an undue burden, i.e., significant difficulty or expense.
    (b) Examples. The term ``auxiliary aids and services'' includes--
    (1) Qualified interpreters, notetakers, computer-aided transcription 
services, written materials, telephone handset amplifiers, assistive 
listening devices, assistive listening systems, telephones compatible 
with hearing aids, closed caption decoders, open and closed captioning, 
telecommunications devices for deaf persons (TDD's), videotext displays, 
or other effective methods of making aurally delivered materials 
available to individuals with hearing impairments;
    (2) Qualified readers, taped texts, audio recordings, Brailled 
materials, large print materials, or other effective methods of making 
visually delivered materials available to individuals with visual 
impairments;
    (3) Acquisition or modification of equipment or devices; and
    (4) Other similar services and actions.
    (c) Effective communication. A public accommodation shall furnish 
appropriate auxiliary aids and services where necessary to ensure 
effective communication with individuals with disabilities.
    (d) Telecommunication devices for the deaf (TDD's). (1) A public 
accommodation that offers a customer, client, patient, or participant 
the opportunity to make outgoing telephone calls on more than an 
incidental convenience basis shall make available, upon request, a TDD 
for the use of an individual who has impaired hearing or a communication 
disorder.
    (2) This part does not require a public accommodation to use a TDD 
for receiving or making telephone calls incident to its operations.
    (e) Closed caption decoders. Places of lodging that provide 
televisions in five or more guest rooms and hospitals that provide 
televisions for patient use shall provide, upon request, a means for 
decoding captions for use by an individual with impaired hearing.
    (f) Alternatives. If provision of a particular auxiliary aid or 
service by a public accommodation would result in a fundamental 
alteration in the nature of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, 
advantages, or accommodations being offered or in an undue burden,

[[Page 583]]

i.e., significant difficulty or expense, the public accommodation shall 
provide an alternative auxiliary aid or service, if one exists, that 
would not result in an alteration or such burden but would nevertheless 
ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with 
disabilities receive the goods, services, facilities, privileges, 
advantages, or accommodations offered by the public accommodation.


<R05>
Sec. 36.304  Removal of barriers.

    (a) General. A public accommodation shall remove architectural 
barriers in existing facilities, including communication barriers that 
are structural in nature, where such removal is readily achievable, 
i.e., easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much 
difficulty or expense.
    (b) Examples. Examples of steps to remove barriers include, but are 
not limited to, the following actions--
    (1) Installing ramps;
    (2) Making curb cuts in sidewalks and entrances;
    (3) Repositioning shelves;
    (4) Rearranging tables, chairs, vending machines, display racks, and 
other furniture;
    (5) Repositioning telephones;
    (6) Adding raised markings on elevator control buttons;
    (7) Installing flashing alarm lights;
    (8) Widening doors;
    (9) Installing offset hinges to widen doorways;
    (10) Eliminating a turnstile or providing an alternative accessible 
path;
    (11) Installing accessible door hardware;
    (12) Installing grab bars in toilet stalls;
    (13) Rearranging toilet partitions to increase maneuvering space;
    (14) Insulating lavatory pipes under sinks to prevent burns;
    (15) Installing a raised toilet seat;
    (16) Installing a full-length bathroom mirror;
    (17) Repositioning the paper towel dispenser in a bathroom;
    (18) Creating designated accessible parking spaces;
    (19) Installing an accessible paper cup dispenser at an existing 
inaccessible water fountain;
    (20) Removing high pile, low density carpeting; or
    (21) Installing vehicle hand controls.
    (c) Priorities. A public accommodation is urged to take measures to 
comply with the barrier removal requirements of this section in 
accordance with the following order of priorities.
    (1) First, a public accommodation should take measures to provide 
access to a place of public accommodation from public sidewalks, 
parking, or public transportation. These measures include, for example, 
installing an entrance ramp, widening entrances, and providing 
accessible parking spaces.
    (2) Second, a public accommodation should take measures to provide 
access to those areas of a place of public accommodation where goods and 
services are made available to the public. These measures include, for 
example, adjusting the layout of display racks, rearranging tables, 
providing Brailled and raised character signage, widening doors, 
providing visual alarms, and installing ramps.
    (3) Third, a public accommodation should take measures to provide 
access to restroom facilities. These measures include, for example, 
removal of obstructing furniture or vending machines, widening of doors, 
installation of ramps, providing accessible signage, widening of toilet 
stalls, and installation of grab bars.
    (4) Fourth, a public accommodation should take any other measures 
necessary to provide access to the goods, services, facilities, 
privileges, advantages, or accommodations of a place of public 
accommodation.
    (d) Relationship to alterations requirements of subpart D of this 
part. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, 
measures taken to comply with the barrier removal requirements of this 
section shall comply with the applicable requirements for alterations in 
Sec. 36.402 and Sec. Sec. 36.404-36.406 of this part for the element 
being altered. The path of travel requirements of Sec. 36.403 shall not 
apply to measures taken solely to comply with the barrier removal 
requirements of this section.
    (2) If, as a result of compliance with the alterations requirements 
specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the measures required to 
remove a barrier

[[Page 584]]

would not be readily achievable, a public accommodation may take other 
readily achievable measures to remove the barrier that do not fully 
comply with the specified requirements. Such measures include, for 
example, providing a ramp with a steeper slope or widening a doorway to 
a narrower width than that mandated by the alterations requirements. No 
measure shall be taken, however, that poses a significant risk to the 
health or safety of individuals with disabilities or others.
    (e) Portable ramps. Portable ramps should be used to comply with 
this section only when installation of a permanent ramp is not readily 
achievable. In order to avoid any significant risk to the health or 
safety of individuals with disabilities or others in using portable 
ramps, due consideration shall be given to safety features such as 
nonslip surfaces, railings, anchoring, and strength of materials.
    (f) Selling or serving space. The rearrangement of temporary or 
movable structures, such as furniture, equipment, and display racks is 
not readily achievable to the extent that it results in a significant 
loss of selling or serving space.
    (g) Limitation on barrier removal obligations. (1) The requirements 
for barrier removal under Sec. 36.304 shall not be interpreted to 
exceed the standards for alterations in subpart D of this part.
    (2) To the extent that relevant standards for alterations are not 
provided in subpart D of this part, then the requirements of Sec. 
36.304 shall not be interpreted to exceed the standards for new 
construction in subpart D of this part.
    (3) This section does not apply to rolling stock and other 
conveyances to the extent that Sec. 36.310 applies to rolling stock and 
other conveyances.


<R05>
Sec. 36.305  Alternatives to barrier removal.

    (a) General. Where a public accommodation can demonstrate that 
barrier removal is not readily achievable, the public accommodation 
shall not fail to make its goods, services, facilities, privileges, 
advantages, or accommodations available through alternative methods, if 
those methods are readily achievable.
    (b) Examples. Examples of alternatives to barrier removal include, 
but are not limited to, the following actions--
    (1) Providing curb service or home delivery;
    (2) Retrieving merchandise from inaccessible shelves or racks;
    (3) Relocating activities to accessible locations;
    (c) Multiscreen cinemas. If it is not readily achievable to remove 
barriers to provide access by persons with mobility impairments to all 
of the theaters of a multiscreen cinema, the cinema shall establish a 
film rotation schedule that provides reasonable access for individuals 
who use wheelchairs to all films. Reasonable notice shall be provided to 
the public as to the location and time of accessible showings.


<R05>
Sec. 36.306  Personal devices and services.

    This part does not require a public accommodation to provide its 
customers, clients, or participants with personal devices, such as

eyeglasses or hearing aids; or services of a personal nature including 
assistance in eating, toileting, or dressing.


<R05>
Sec. 36.307  Accessible or special goods.

    (a) This part does not require a public accommodation to alter its 
inventory to include accessible or special goods that are designed for, 
or facilitate use by, individuals with disabilities.
    (b) A public accommodation shall order accessible or special goods 
at the request of an individual with disabilities, if, in the normal 
course of its operation, it makes special orders on request for 
unstocked goods, and if the accessible or special goods can be obtained 
from a supplier with whom the public accommodation customarily does 
business.
    (c) Examples of accessible or special goods include items such as 
Brailled versions of books, books on audio cassettes, closed-captioned 
video tapes, special sizes or lines of clothing, and special foods to 
meet particular dietary needs.

<R05>
Sec. 36.308  Seating in assembly areas.

    (a) Existing facilities. (1) To the extent that it is readily 
achievable, a public accommodation in assembly areas shall--
    (i) Provide a reasonable number of wheelchair seating spaces and 
seats with removable aisle-side arm rests; and
    (ii) Locate the wheelchair seating spaces so that they--
    (A) Are dispersed throughout the seating area;
    (B) Provide lines of sight and choice of admission prices comparable 
to those for members of the general public;
    (C) Adjoin an accessible route that also serves as a means of egress 
in case of emergency; and
    (D) Permit individuals who use wheelchairs to sit with family 
members or other companions.
    (2) If removal of seats is not readily achievable, a public 
accommodation shall provide, to the extent that it is readily achievable 
to do so, a portable chair or other means to permit a family member or 
other companion to sit with an individual who uses a wheelchair.
    (3) The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section shall not be 
interpreted to exceed the standards for alterations in subpart D of this 
part.
    (b) New construction and alterations. The provision and location of 
wheelchair seating spaces in newly constructed or altered assembly areas 
shall be governed by the standards for new construction and alterations 
in subpart D of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 36.309  Examinations and courses.

    (a) General. Any private entity that offers examinations or courses 
related to applications, licensing, certification, or credentialing for 
secondary or postsecondary education, professional, or trade purposes 
shall offer such examinations or courses in a place and manner 
accessible to persons with disabilities or offer alternative accessible 
arrangements for such individuals.
    (b) Examinations. (1) Any private entity offering an examination 
covered by this section must assure that--
    (i) The examination is selected and administered so as to best 
ensure that, when the examination is administered to an individual with 
a disability that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the 
examination results accurately reflect the individual's aptitude or 
achievement level or whatever other factor the examination purports to 
measure, rather than reflecting the individual's impaired sensory, 
manual, or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors 
that the examination purports to measure);
    (ii) An examination that is designed for individuals with impaired 
sensory, manual, or speaking skills is offered at equally convenient 
locations, as often, and in as timely a manner as are other 
examinations; and
    (iii) The examination is administered in facilities that are 
accessible to individuals with disabilities or alternative accessible 
arrangements are made.
    (2) Required modifications to an examination may include changes in 
the length of time permitted for completion of the examination and 
adaptation of the manner in which the examination is given.
    (3) A private entity offering an examination covered by this section 
shall provide appropriate auxiliary aids for persons with impaired 
sensory, manual, or speaking skills, unless that private entity can 
demonstrate that offering a particular auxiliary aid would fundamentally 
alter the measurement of the skills or knowledge the examination is 
intended to test or would result in an undue burden. Auxiliary aids and 
services required by this section may include taped examinations, 
interpreters or other effective methods of making orally delivered 
materials available to individuals with hearing impairments, Brailled or 
large print examinations and answer sheets or qualified readers for 
individuals with visual impairments or learning disabilities, 
transcribers for individuals with manual impairments, and other similar 
services and actions.
    (4) Alternative accessible arrangements may include, for example, 
provision of an examination at an individual's home with a proctor if 
accessible facilities or equipment are unavailable.

[[Page 586]]

Alternative arrangements must provide comparable conditions to those 
provided for nondisabled individuals.
    (c) Courses. (1) Any private entity that offers a course covered by 
this section must make such modifications to that course as are 
necessary to ensure that the place and manner in which the course is 
given are accessible to individuals with disabilities.
    (2) Required modifications may include changes in the length of time 
permitted for the completion of the course, substitution of specific 
requirements, or adaptation of the manner in which the course is 
conducted or course materials are distributed.
    (3) A private entity that offers a course covered by this section 
shall provide appropriate auxiliary aids and services for persons with 
impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills, unless the private entity 
can demonstrate that offering a particular auxiliary aid or service 
would fundamentally alter the course or would result in an undue burden. 
Auxiliary aids and services required by this section may include taped 
texts, interpreters or other effective methods of making orally 
delivered materials available to individuals with hearing impairments, 
Brailled or large print texts or qualified readers for individuals with 
visual impairments and learning disabilities, classroom equipment 
adapted for use by individuals with manual impairments, and other 
similar services and actions.
    (4) Courses must be administered in facilities that are accessible 
to individuals with disabilities or alternative accessible arrangements 
must be made.
    (5) Alternative accessible arrangements may include, for example, 
provision of the course through videotape, cassettes, or prepared notes. 
Alternative arrangements must provide comparable conditions to those 
provided for nondisabled individuals.


<R05>
Sec. 36.310  Transportation provided by public accommodations.

    (a) General. (1) A public accommodation that provides transportation 
services, but that is not primarily engaged in the business of 
transporting people, is subject to the general and specific provisions 
in subparts B, C, and D of this part for its transportation operations, 
except as provided in this section.
    (2) Examples. Transportation services subject to this section 
include, but are not limited to, shuttle services operated between 
transportation terminals and places of public accommodation, customer 
shuttle bus services operated by private companies and shopping centers, 
student transportation systems, and transportation provided within 
recreational facilities such as stadiums, zoos, amusement parks, and ski 
resorts.
    (b) Barrier removal. A public accommodation subject to this section 
shall remove transportation barriers in existing vehicles and rail 
passenger cars used for transporting individuals (not including barriers 
that can only be removed through the retrofitting of vehicles or rail 
passenger cars by the installation of a hydraulic or other lift) where 
such removal is readily achievable.
    (c) Requirements for vehicles and systems. A public accommodation 
subject to this section shall comply with the requirements pertaining to 
vehicles and transportation systems in the regulations issued by the 
Secretary of Transportation pursuant to section 306 of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. Sec. 36.311-36.399  [Reserved]


<R04>
               Subpart D_New Construction and Alterations


<R05>
Sec. 36.401  New construction.

    (a) General. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
this section, discrimination for purposes of this part includes a 
failure to design and construct facilities for first occupancy after 
January 26, 1993, that are readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with disabilities.
    (2) For purposes of this section, a facility is designed and 
constructed for first occupancy after January 26, 1993, only--
    (i) If the last application for a building permit or permit 
extension for the facility is certified to be complete, by a State, 
County, or local government after January 26, 1992 (or, in those 
jurisdictions where the government does not certify completion of 
applications,

[[Page 587]]

if the last application for a building permit or permit extension for 
the facility is received by the State, County, or local government after 
January 26, 1992); and
    (ii) If the first certificate of occupancy for the facility is 
issued after January 26, 1993.
    (b) Commercial facilities located in private residences. (1) When a 
commercial facility is located in a private residence, the portion of 
the residence used exclusively as a residence is not covered by this 
subpart, but that portion used exclusively in the operation of the 
commercial facility or that portion used both for the commercial 
facility and for residential purposes is covered by the new construction 
and alterations requirements of this subpart.
    (2) The portion of the residence covered under paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section extends to those elements used to enter the commercial 
facility, including the homeowner's front sidewalk, if any, the door or 
entryway, and hallways; and those portions of the residence, interior or 
exterior, available to or used by employees or visitors of the 
commercial facility, including restrooms.
    (c) Exception for structural impracticability. (1) Full compliance 
with the requirements of this section is not required where an entity 
can demonstrate that it is structurally impracticable to meet the 
requirements. Full compliance will be considered structurally 
impracticable only in those rare circumstances when the unique 
characteristics of terrain prevent the incorporation of accessibility 
features.
    (2) If full compliance with this section would be structurally 
impracticable, compliance with this section is required to the extent 
that it is not structurally impracticable. In that case, any portion of 
the facility that can be made accessible shall be made accessible to the 
extent that it is not structurally impracticable.
    (3) If providing accessibility in conformance with this section to 
individuals with certain disabilities (e.g., those who use wheelchairs) 
would be structurally impracticable, accessibility shall nonetheless be 
ensured to persons with other types of disabilities (e.g., those who use 
crutches or who have sight, hearing, or mental impairments) in 
accordance with this section.
    (d) Elevator exemption. (1) For purposes of this paragraph (d)--
    (i) Professional office of a health care provider means a location 
where a person or entity regulated by a State to provide professional 
services related to the physical or mental health of an individual makes 
such services available to the public. The facility housing the 
``professional office of a health care provider'' only includes floor 
levels housing at least one health care provider, or any floor level 
designed or intended for use by at least one health care provider.
    (ii) Shopping center or shopping mall means--
    (A) A building housing five or more sales or rental establishments; 
or
    (B) A series of buildings on a common site, either under common 
ownership or common control or developed either as one project or as a 
series of related projects, housing five or more sales or rental 
establishments. For purposes of this section, places of public 
accommodation of the types listed in paragraph (5) of the definition of 
``place of public accommodation'' in section Sec. 36.104 are considered 
sales or rental establishments. The facility housing a ``shopping center 
or shopping mall'' only includes floor levels housing at least one sales 
or rental establishment, or any floor level designed or intended for use 
by at least one sales or rental establishment.
    (2) This section does not require the installation of an elevator in 
a facility that is less than three stories or has less than 3000 square 
feet per story, except with respect to any facility that houses one or 
more of the following:
    (i) A shopping center or shopping mall, or a professional office of 
a health care provider.
    (ii) A terminal, depot, or other station used for specified public 
transportation, or an airport passenger terminal. In such a facility, 
any area housing passenger services, including boarding and debarking, 
loading and unloading, baggage claim, dining facilities, and other 
common areas open to the public, must be on an accessible route from an 
accessible entrance.

[[Page 588]]

    (3) The elevator exemption set forth in this paragraph (d) does not 
obviate or limit, in any way the obligation to comply with the other 
accessibility requirements established in paragraph (a) of this section. 
For example, in a facility that houses a shopping center or shopping 
mall, or a professional office of a health care provider, the floors 
that are above or below an accessible ground floor and that do not house 
sales or rental establishments or a professional office of a health care 
provider, must meet the requirements of this section but for the 
elevator.


<R05>
Sec. 36.402  Alterations.

    (a) General. (1) Any alteration to a place of public accommodation 
or a commercial facility, after January 26, 1992, shall be made so as to 
ensure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the altered portions of the 
facility are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with 
disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs.
    (2) An alteration is deemed to be undertaken after January 26, 1992, 
if the physical alteration of the property begins after that date.
    (b) Alteration. For the purposes of this part, an alteration is a 
change to a place of public accommodation or a commercial facility that 
affects or could affect the usability of the building or facility or any 
part thereof.
    (1) Alterations include, but are not limited to, remodeling, 
renovation, rehabilitation, reconstruction, historic restoration, 
changes or rearrangement in structural parts or elements, and changes or 
rearrangement in the plan configuration of walls and full-height 
partitions. Normal maintenance, reroofing, painting or wallpapering, 
asbestos removal, or changes to mechanical and electrical systems are 
not alterations unless they affect the usability of the building or 
facility.
    (2) If existing elements, spaces, or common areas are altered, then 
each such altered element, space, or area shall comply with the 
applicable provisions of appendix A to this part.
    (c) To the maximum extent feasible. The phrase ``to the maximum 
extent feasible,'' as used in this section, applies to the occasional 
case where the nature of an existing facility makes it virtually 
impossible to comply fully with applicable accessibility standards 
through a planned alteration. In these circumstances, the alteration 
shall provide the maximum physical accessibility feasible. Any altered 
features of the facility that can be made accessible shall be made 
accessible. If providing accessibility in conformance with this section 
to individuals with certain disabilities (e.g., those who use 
wheelchairs) would not be feasible, the facility shall be made 
accessible to persons with other types of disabilities (e.g., those who 
use crutches, those who have impaired vision or hearing, or those who 
have other impairments).


<R05>
Sec. 36.403  Alterations: Path of travel.

    (a) General. An alteration that affects or could affect the 
usability of or access to an area of a facility that contains a primary 
function shall be made so as to ensure that, to the maximum extent 
feasible, the path of travel to the altered area and the restrooms, 
telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area, are readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including 
individuals who use wheelchairs, unless the cost and scope of such 
alterations is disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration.
    (b) Primary function. A ``primary function'' is a major activity for 
which the facility is intended. Areas that contain a primary function 
include, but are not limited to, the customer services lobby of a bank, 
the dining area of a cafeteria, the meeting rooms in a conference 
center, as well as offices and other work areas in which the activities 
of the public accommodation or other private entity using the facility 
are carried out. Mechanical rooms, boiler rooms, supply storage rooms, 
employee lounges or locker rooms, janitorial closets, entrances, 
corridors, and restrooms are not areas containing a primary function.
    (c) Alterations to an area containing a primary function. (1) 
Alterations that affect the usability of or access to an area containing 
a primary function include, but are not limited to--
    (i) Remodeling merchandise display areas or employee work areas in a 
department store;

[[Page 589]]

    (ii) Replacing an inaccessible floor surface in the customer service 
or employee work areas of a bank;
    (iii) Redesigning the assembly line area of a factory; or
    (iv) Installing a computer center in an accounting firm.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, alterations to windows, 
hardware, controls, electrical outlets, and signage shall not be deemed 
to be alterations that affect the usability of or access to an area 
containing a primary function.
    (d) Landlord/tenant: If a tenant is making alterations as defined in 
Sec. 36.402 that would trigger the requirements of this section, those 
alterations by the tenant in areas that only the tenant occupies do not 
trigger a path of travel obligation upon the landlord with respect to 
areas of the facility under the landlord's authority, if those areas are 
not otherwise being altered.
    (e) Path of travel. (1) A ``path of travel'' includes a continuous, 
unobstructed way of pedestrian passage by means of which the altered 
area may be approached, entered, and exited, and which connects the 
altered area with an exterior approach (including sidewalks, streets, 
and parking areas), an entrance to the facility, and other parts of the 
facility.
    (2) An accessible path of travel may consist of walks and sidewalks, 
curb ramps and other interior or exterior pedestrian ramps; clear floor 
paths through lobbies, corridors, rooms, and other improved areas; 
parking access aisles; elevators and lifts; or a combination of these 
elements.
    (3) For the purposes of this part, the term ``path of travel'' also 
includes the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the 
altered area.
    (f) Disproportionality. (1) Alterations made to provide an 
accessible path of travel to the altered area will be deemed 
disproportionate to the overall alteration when the cost exceeds 20% of 
the cost of the alteration to the primary function area.
    (2) Costs that may be counted as expenditures required to provide an 
accessible path of travel may include:
    (i) Costs associated with providing an accessible entrance and an 
accessible route to the altered area, for example, the cost of widening 
doorways or installing ramps;
    (ii) Costs associated with making restrooms accessible, such as 
installing grab bars, enlarging toilet stalls, insulating pipes, or 
installing accessible faucet controls;
    (iii) Costs associated with providing accessible telephones, such as 
relocating the telephone to an accessible height, installing 
amplification devices, or installing a telecommunications device for 
deaf persons (TDD);
    (iv) Costs associated with relocating an inaccessible drinking 
fountain.
    (g) Duty to provide accessible features in the event of 
disproportionality. (1) When the cost of alterations necessary to make 
the path of travel to the altered area fully accessible is 
disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration, the path of 
travel shall be made accessible to the extent that it can be made 
accessible without incurring disproportionate costs.
    (2) In choosing which accessible elements to provide, priority 
should be given to those elements that will provide the greatest access, 
in the following order:
    (i) An accessible entrance;
    (ii) An accessible route to the altered area;
    (iii) At least one accessible restroom for each sex or a single 
unisex restroom;
    (iv) Accessible telephones;
    (v) Accessible drinking fountains; and
    (vi) When possible, additional accessible elements such as parking, 
storage, and alarms.
    (h) Series of smaller alterations. (1) The obligation to provide an 
accessible path of travel may not be evaded by performing a series of 
small alterations to the area served by a single path of travel if those 
alterations could have been performed as a single undertaking.
    (2)(i) If an area containing a primary function has been altered 
without providing an accessible path of travel to that area, and 
subsequent alterations of that area, or a different area on the same 
path of travel, are undertaken within three years of the original 
alteration, the total cost of alterations to the primary function areas 
on that

[[Page 590]]

path of travel during the preceding three year period shall be 
considered in determining whether the cost of making that path of travel 
accessible is disproportionate.
    (ii) Only alterations undertaken after January 26, 1992, shall be 
considered in determining if the cost of providing an accessible path of 
travel is disproportionate to the overall cost of the alterations.


<R05>
Sec. 36.404  Alterations: Elevator exemption.

    (a) This section does not require the installation of an elevator in 
an altered facility that is less than three stories or has less than 
3,000 square feet per story, except with respect to any facility that 
houses a shopping center, a shopping mall, the professional office of a 
health care provider, a terminal, depot, or other station used for 
specified public transportation, or an airport passenger terminal.
    (1) For the purposes of this section, professional office of a 
health care provider means a location where a person or entity regulated 
by a State to provide professional services related to the physical or 
mental health of an individual makes such services available to the 
public. The facility that houses a professional office of a health care 
provider only includes floor levels housing by at least one health care 
provider, or any floor level designed or intended for use by at least 
one health care provider.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, shopping center or shopping 
mall means--
    (i) A building housing five or more sales or rental establishments; 
or
    (ii) A series of buildings on a common site, connected by a common 
pedestrian access route above or below the ground floor, that is either 
under common ownership or common control or developed either as one 
project or as a series of related projects, housing five or more sales 
or rental establishments. For purposes of this section, places of public 
accommodation of the types listed in paragraph (5) of the definition of 
place of public accommodation in Sec. 36.104 are considered sales or 
rental establishments. The facility housing a shopping center or 
shopping mall only includes floor levels housing at least one sales or 
rental establishment, or any floor level designed or intended for use by 
at least one sales or rental establishment.
    (b) The exemption provided in paragraph (a) of this section does not 
obviate or limit in any way the obligation to comply with the other 
accessibility requirements established in this subpart. For example, 
alterations to floors above or below the accessible ground floor must be 
accessible regardless of whether the altered facility has an elevator.


<R05>
Sec. 36.405  Alterations: Historic preservation.

    (a) Alterations to buildings or facilities that are eligible for 
listing in the National Register of Historic Places under the National 
Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.), or are designated as 
historic under State or local law, shall comply to the maximum extent 
feasible with section 4.1.7 of appendix A to this part.
    (b) If it is determined under the procedures set out in section 
4.1.7 of appendix A that it is not feasible to provide physical access 
to an historic property that is a place of public accommodation in a 
manner that will not threaten or destroy the historic significance of 
the building or facility, alternative methods of access shall be 
provided pursuant to the requirements of subpart C of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 36.406  Standards for new construction and alterations.

    (a) New construction and alterations subject to this part shall 
comply with the standards for accessible design published as appendix A 
to this part (ADAAG).
    (b) The chart in the appendix to this section provides guidance to 
the user in reading appendix A to this part (ADAAG) together with 
subparts A through D of this part, when determining requirements for a 
particular facility.

                        Appendix to Sec. 36.406

    This chart has no effect for purposes of compliance or enforcement. 
It does not necessarily provide complete or mandatory information.

<R05>
Sec. 36.501  Private suits.

    (a) General. Any person who is being subjected to discrimination on 
the basis of disability in violation of the Act or this part or who has 
reasonable grounds for believing that such person is about to be 
subjected to discrimination in violation of section 303 of the Act or 
subpart D of this part may institute a civil action for preventive 
relief, including an application for a permanent or temporary 
injunction, restraining order, or other order. Upon timely application, 
the court may, in its discretion, permit the Attorney General to 
intervene in the civil action if the Attorney General or his or her 
designee certifies that the case is of general public importance. Upon 
application by the complainant and in such circumstances as the court 
may deem just, the court may appoint an attorney for such complainant 
and may authorize the commencement of the civil action without the 
payment of fees, costs, or security. Nothing in this section shall 
require a person with a disability to engage in a futile gesture if

[[Page 592]]

the person has actual notice that a person or organization covered by 
title III of the Act or this part does not intend to comply with its 
provisions.
    (b) Injunctive relief. In the case of violations of Sec. 36.304, 
Sec. Sec. 36.308, 36.310(b), 36.401, 36.402, 36.403, and 36.405 of this 
part, injunctive relief shall include an order to alter facilities to 
make such facilities readily accessible to and usable by individuals 
with disabilities to the extent required by the Act or this part. Where 
appropriate, injunctive relief shall also include requiring the 
provision of an auxiliary aid or service, modification of a policy, or 
provision of alternative methods, to the extent required by the Act or 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 36.502  Investigations and compliance reviews.

    (a) The Attorney General shall investigate alleged violations of the 
Act or this part.
    (b) Any individual who believes that he or she or a specific class 
of persons has been subjected to discrimination prohibited by the Act or 
this part may request the Department to institute an investigation.
    (c) Where the Attorney General has reason to believe that there may 
be a violation of this part, he or she may initiate a compliance review.


<R05>
Sec. 36.503  Suit by the Attorney General.

    Following a compliance review or investigation under Sec. 36.502, 
or at any other time in his or her discretion, the Attorney General may 
commence a civil action in any appropriate United States district court 
if the Attorney General has reasonable cause to believe that--
    (a) Any person or group of persons is engaged in a pattern or 
practice of discrimination in violation of the Act or this part; or
    (b) Any person or group of persons has been discriminated against in 
violation of the Act or this part and the discrimination raises an issue 
of general public importance.


<R05>
Sec. 36.504  Relief.

    (a) Authority of court. In a civil action under Sec. 36.503, the 
court--
    (1) May grant any equitable relief that such court considers to be 
appropriate, including, to the extent required by the Act or this part--
    (i) Granting temporary, preliminary, or permanent relief;
    (ii) Providing an auxiliary aid or service, modification of policy, 
practice, or procedure, or alternative method; and
    (iii) Making facilities readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with disabilities;
    (2) May award other relief as the court considers to be appropriate, 
including monetary damages to persons aggrieved when requested by the 
Attorney General; and
    (3) May, to vindicate the public interest, assess a civil penalty 
against the entity in an amount
    (i) Not exceeding $50,000 for a first violation occurring before 
September 29, 1999, and not exceeding $55,000 for a first violation 
occurring on or after September 29, 1999; and
    (ii) Not exceeding $100,000 for any subsequent violation occurring 
before September 29, 1999, and not exceeding $110,000 for any subsequent 
violation occurring on or after September 29, 1999.
    (b) Single violation. For purposes of paragraph (a) (3) of this 
section, in determining whether a first or subsequent violation has 
occurred, a determination in a single action, by judgment or settlement, 
that the covered entity has engaged in more than one discriminatory act 
shall be counted as a single violation.
    (c) Punitive damages. For purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, the terms ``monetary damages'' and ``such other relief'' do not 
include punitive damages.
    (d) Judicial consideration. In a civil action under Sec. 36.503, 
the court, when considering what amount of civil penalty, if any, is 
appropriate, shall give consideration to any good faith effort or 
attempt to comply with this part by the entity. In evaluating good 
faith, the court shall consider, among other factors it deems relevant, 
whether the entity could have reasonably anticipated the need for an 
appropriate type of auxiliary aid needed to accommodate

[[Page 593]]

the unique needs of a particular individual with a disability.

[Order No. 1513-91, 56 FR 35592, July 26, 1991, as amended by Order No. 
2249-99, 64 FR 47103, Aug. 30, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 36.505  Attorneys fees.

    In any action or administrative proceeding commenced pursuant to the 
Act or this part, the court or agency, in its discretion, may allow the 
prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's 
fee, including litigation expenses, and costs, and the United States 
shall be liable for the foregoing the same as a private individual.


<R05>
Sec. 36.506  Alternative means of dispute resolution.

    Where appropriate and to the extent authorized by law, the use of 
alternative means of dispute resolution, including settlement 
negotiations, conciliation, facilitation, mediation, factfinding, 
minitrials, and arbitration, is encouraged to resolve disputes arising 
under the Act and this part.


<R05>
Sec. 36.507  Effect of unavailability of technical assistance.

    A public accommodation or other private entity shall not be excused 
from compliance with the requirements of this part because of any 
failure to receive technical assistance, including any failure in the 
development or dissemination of any technical assistance manual 
authorized by the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 36.508  Effective date.

    (a) General. Except as otherwise provided in this section and in 
this part, this part shall become effective on January 26, 1992.
    (b) Civil actions. Except for any civil action brought for a 
violation of section 303 of the Act, no civil action shall be brought 
for any act or omission described in section 302 of the Act that 
occurs--
    (1) Before July 26, 1992, against businesses with 25 or fewer 
employees and gross receipts of $1,000,000 or less.
    (2) Before January 26, 1993, against businesses with 10 or fewer 
employees and gross receipts of $500,000 or less.

purchased or leased vehicles required to be accessible by Sec. 36.310 
must be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with 
disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, if the 
solicitation for the vehicle is made after August 25, 1990.

17522, Apr. 5, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 36.604  Preliminary determination.

    After consultation with the Architectural and Transportation 
Barriers Compliance Board, the Assistant Attorney General shall make a 
preliminary determination of equivalency or a preliminary determination 
to deny certification.


<R05>
Sec. 36.605  Procedure following preliminary determination of equivalency.

    (a) If the Assistant Attorney General makes a preliminary 
determination of equivalency under Sec. 36.604, he or she shall inform 
the submitting official, in writing, of that preliminary determination. 
The Assistant Attorney General shall also--
    (1) Publish a notice in the Federal Register that advises the public 
of the preliminary determination of equivalency with respect to the 
particular

[[Page 595]]

code, and invite interested persons and organizations, including 
individuals with disabilities, during a period of at least 60 days 
following publication of the notice, to file written comments relevant 
to whether a final certification of equivalency should be issued;
    (2) After considering the information received in response to the 
notice described in paragraph (a) of this section, and after publishing 
a separate notice in the Federal Register, hold an informal hearing in 
Washington, DC at which interested persons, including individuals with 
disabilities, are provided an opportunity to express their views with 
respect to the preliminary determination of equivalency; and
    (b) The Assistant Attorney General, after consultation with the 
Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, and 
consideration of the materials and information submitted pursuant to 
this section and Sec. 36.603, shall issue either a certification of 
equivalency or a final determination to deny the request for 
certification. He or she shall publish notice of the certification of 
equivalency or denial of certification in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 36.606  Procedure following preliminary denial of certification.

    (a) If the Assistant Attorney General makes a Preliminary 
determination to deny certification of a code under Sec. 36.604, he or 
she shall notify the submitting official of the determination. The 
notification may include specification of the manner in which the code 
could be amended in order to qualify for certification.
    (b) The Assistant Attorney General shall allow the submitting 
official not less than 15 days to submit data, views, and arguments in 
opposition to the preliminary determination to deny certification. If 
the submitting official does not submit materials, the Assistant 
Attorney General shall not be required to take any further action. If 
the submitting official submits materials, the Assistant Attorney 
General shall evaluate those materials and any other relevant 
information. After evaluation of any newly submitted materials, the 
Assistant Attorney General shall make either a final denial of 
certification or a preliminary determination of equivalency.


<R05>
Sec. 36.607  Effect of certification.

    (a)(1) A certification shall be considered a certification of 
equivalency only with respect to those features or elements that are 
both covered by the certified code and addressed by the standards 
against which equivalency is measured.
    (2) For example, if certain equipment is not covered by the code, 
the determination of equivalency cannot be used as evidence with respect 
to the question of whether equipment in a building built according to 
the code satisfies the Act's requirements with respect to such 
equipment. By the same token, certification would not be relevant to 
construction of a facility for children, if the regulations against 
which equivalency is measured do not address children's facilities.
    (b) A certification of equivalency is effective only with respect to 
the particular edition of the code for which certification is granted. 
Any amendments or other changes to the code after the date of the 
certified edition are not considered part of the certification.
    (c) A submitting official may reapply for certification of 
amendments or other changes to a code that has already received 
certification.


<R05>
Sec. 36.608  Guidance concerning model codes.

    Upon application by an authorized representative of a private entity 
responsible for developing a model code, the Assistant Attorney General 
may review the relevant model code and issue guidance concerning whether 
and in what respects the model code is consistent with the minimum 
requirements of the Act for the accessibility and usability of places of 
public accommodation and commercial facilities under this part.

 Appendix B to Part 36--Preamble to Regulation on Nondiscrimination on 
   the Basis of Disability by Public Accommodations and in Commercial 
                  Facilities (Published July 26, 1991)

    Note: For the convenience of the reader, this appendix contains the 
text of the preamble to the final regulation on nondiscrimination on the 
basis of disability by public accommodations and in commercial 
facilities beginning at the heading ``Section-by-Section Analysis and 
Response to Comments'' and ending before ``List of Subjects in 28 CFR 
part 36'' (56 FR 35546, July 26, 1991).

          Section-By-Section Analysis and Response to Comments

                           Subpart A--General

                         Section 36.101 Purpose

    Section 36.101 states the purpose of the rule, which is to 
effectuate title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. 
This title prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by public 
accommodations, requires places of public accommodation and commercial 
facilities to be designed, constructed, and altered in compliance with 
the accessibility standards established by this part, and requires that 
examinations or courses related to licensing or certification for 
professional or trade purposes be accessible to persons with 
disabilities.

                       Section 36.102 Application

    Section 36.102 specifies the range of entities and facilities that 
have obligations under the final rule. The rule applies to any public 
accommodation or commercial facility as those terms are defined in Sec. 
36.104. It also applies, in accordance with section 309 of the ADA, to 
private entities that offer examinations or courses related to 
applications, licensing, certification, or credentialing for secondary 
or postsecondary education, professional, or trade purposes. Except as 
provided in Sec. 36.206, ``Retaliation or coercion,'' this part does 
not apply to individuals other than public accommodations or to public 
entities. Coverage of private individuals and public entities is 
discussed in the preamble to Sec. 36.206.
    As defined in Sec. 36.104, a public accommodation is a private 
entity that owns, leases or leases to, or operates a place of public 
accommodation. Section 36.102(b)(2) emphasizes that the general and 
specific public accommodations requirements of subparts B and C obligate 
a public accommodation only with respect to the operations of a place of 
public accommodation. This distinction is drawn in recognition of the 
fact that a private entity that meets the regulatory definition of 
public accommodation could also own, lease or lease to, or operate 
facilities that are not places of public accommodation. The rule would 
exceed the reach of the ADA if it were to apply the public 
accommodations requirements of subparts B and C to the operations of a 
private entity that do not involve a place of public accommodation. 
Similarly, Sec. 36.102(b)(3) provides that the new construction and 
alterations requirements of subpart D obligate a public accommodation 
only with respect to facilities used as, or designed or constructed for 
use as, places of public accommodation or commercial facilities.
    On the other hand, as mandated by the ADA and reflected in Sec. 
36.102(c), the new construction and alterations requirements of subpart 
D apply to a commercial facility whether or not the facility is a place 
of public accommodation, or is owned, leased, leased to, or operated by 
a public accommodation.
    Section 36.102(e) states that the rule does not apply to any private 
club, religious entity, or public entity. Each of these terms is defined 
in Sec. 36.104. The exclusion of private clubs and religious entities 
is derived from section 307 of the ADA; and the exclusion of public 
entities is based on the statutory definition of public accommodation in 
section 301(7) of the ADA, which excludes entities other than private 
entities from coverage under title III of the ADA.

                Section 36.103 Relationship to Other Laws

    Section 36.103 is derived from sections 501 (a) and (b) of the ADA. 
Paragraph (a) provides that, except as otherwise specifically provided 
by this part, the ADA is not intended to apply lesser standards than are 
required under title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 
U.S.C. 790-794), or the regulations implementing that title. The 
standards of title V of the Rehabilitation Act apply for purposes of the 
ADA to the extent that the ADA has not explicitly adopted a different 
standard from title V. Where the ADA explicitly provides a different 
standard from section 504, the ADA standard applies to the ADA, but not 
to section 504. For example, section 504 requires that all federally 
assisted programs and activities be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps, even if major structural alterations are 
necessary to make a program accessible. Title III of the ADA, in 
contrast, only requires alterations to existing facilities if the 
modifications are ``readily achievable,'' that is, able to be 
accomplished easily and without much difficulty or expense. A public 
accommodation that is covered under both section 504 and the ADA is 
still required to meet the ``program accessibility'' standard in order 
to comply with section 504, but would not be in violation of the ADA 
unless

[[Page 688]]

it failed to make ``readily achievable'' modifications. On the other 
hand, an entity covered by the ADA is required to make ``readily 
achievable'' modifications, even if the program can be made accessible 
without any architectural modifications. Thus, an entity covered by both 
section 504 and title III of the ADA must meet both the ``program 
accessibility'' requirement and the ``readily achievable'' requirement.
    Paragraph (b) makes explicit that the rule does not affect the 
obligation of recipients of Federal financial assistance to comply with 
the requirements imposed under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 
1973.
    Paragraph (c) makes clear that Congress did not intend to displace 
any of the rights or remedies provided by other Federal laws or other 
State or local laws (including State common law) that provide greater or 
equal protection to individuals with disabilities. A plaintiff may 
choose to pursue claims under a State law that does not confer greater 
substantive rights, or even confers fewer substantive rights, if the 
alleged violation is protected under the alternative law and the 
remedies are greater. For example, assume that a person with a physical 
disability seeks damages under a State law that allows compensatory and 
punitive damages for discrimination on the basis of physical disability, 
but does not allow them on the basis of mental disability. In that 
situation, the State law would provide narrower coverage, by excluding 
mental disabilities, but broader remedies, and an individual covered by 
both laws could choose to bring an action under both laws. Moreover, 
State tort claims confer greater remedies and are not preempted by the 
ADA. A plaintiff may join a State tort claim to a case brought under the 
ADA. In such a case, the plaintiff must, of course, prove all the 
elements of the State tort claim in order to prevail under that cause of 
action.
    A commenter had concerns about privacy requirements for banking 
transactions using telephone relay services. Title IV of the Act 
provides adequate protections for ensuring the confidentiality of 
communications using the relay services. This issue is more 
appropriately addressed by the Federal Communications Commission in its 
regulation implementing title IV of the Act.

                       Section 36.104 Definitions

    ``Act.'' The word ``Act'' is used in the regulation to refer to the 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101-336, which is also 
referred to as the ``ADA.''
    ``Commerce.'' The definition of ``commerce'' is identical to the 
statutory definition provided in section 301(l) of the ADA. It means 
travel, trade, traffic, commerce, transportation, or communication among 
the several States, between any foreign country or any territory or 
possession and any State, or between points in the same State but 
through another State or foreign country. Commerce is defined in the 
same manner as in title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which 
prohibits racial discrimination in public accommodations.
    The term ``commerce'' is used in the definition of ``place of public 
accommodation.'' According to that definition, one of the criteria that 
an entity must meet before it can be considered a place of public 
accommodation is that its operations affect commerce. The term 
``commerce'' is similarly used in the definition of ``commercial 
facility.''
    The use of the phrase ``operations affect commerce'' applies the 
full scope of coverage of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution in 
enforcing the ADA. The Constitution gives Congress broad authority to 
regulate interstate commerce, including the activities of local business 
enterprises (e.g., a physician's office, a neighborhood restaurant, a 
laundromat, or a bakery) that affect interstate commerce through the 
purchase or sale of products manufactured in other States, or by 
providing services to individuals from other States. Because of the 
integrated nature of the national economy, the ADA and this final rule 
will have extremely broad application.
    ``Commercial facilities'' are those facilities that are intended for 
nonresidential use by a private entity and whose operations affect 
commerce. As explained under Sec. 36.401, ``New construction,'' the new 
construction and alteration requirements of subpart D of the rule apply 
to all commercial facilities, whether or not they are places of public 
accommodation. Those commercial facilities that are not places of public 
accommodation are not subject to the requirements of subparts B and C 
(e.g., those requirements concerning auxiliary aids and general 
nondiscrimination provisions).
    Congress recognized that the employees within commercial facilities 
would generally be protected under title I (employment) of the Act. 
However, as the House Committee on Education and Labor pointed out, 
``[t]o the extent that new facilities are built in a manner that make[s] 
them accessible to all individuals, including potential employees, there 
will be less of a need for individual employers to engage in reasonable 
accommodations for particular employees.'' H.R. Rep. No. 485, 101st 
Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, at 117 (1990) [hereinafter ``Education and Labor 
report'']. While employers of fewer than 15 employees are not covered by 
title I's employment discrimination provisions, there is no such 
limitation with respect to new construction covered under title III. 
Congress chose not to so limit the new construction provisions because 
of its desire for a uniform requirement of accessibility in new 
construction, because accessibility can be accomplished easily in the 
design and construction

[[Page 689]]

stage, and because future expansion of a business or sale or lease of 
the property to a larger employer or to a business that is a place of 
public accommodation is always a possibility.
    The term ``commercial facilities'' is not intended to be defined by 
dictionary or common industry definitions. Included in this category are 
factories, warehouses, office buildings, and other buildings in which 
employment may occur. The phrase, ``whose operations affect commerce,'' 
is to be read broadly, to include all types of activities reached under 
the commerce clause of the Constitution.
    Privately operated airports are also included in the category of 
commercial facilities. They are not, however, places of public 
accommodation because they are not terminals used for ``specified public 
transportation.'' (Transportation by aircraft is specifically excluded 
from the statutory definition of ``specified public transportation.'') 
Thus, privately operated airports are subject to the new construction 
and alteration requirements of this rule (subpart D) but not to subparts 
B and C. (Airports operated by public entities are covered by title II 
of the Act.) Places of public accommodation located within airports, 
such as restaurants, shops, lounges, or conference centers, however, are 
covered by subparts B and C of this part.
    The statute's definition of ``commercial facilities'' specifically 
includes only facilities ``that are intended for nonresidential use'' 
and specifically exempts those facilities that are covered or expressly 
exempted from coverage under the Fair Housing Act of 1968, as amended 
(42 U.S.C. 3601-3631). The interplay between the Fair Housing Act and 
the ADA with respect to those facilities that are ``places of public 
accommodation'' was the subject of many comments and is addressed in the 
preamble discussion of the definition of ``place of public 
accommodation.''
    ``Current illegal use of drugs.'' The phrase ``current illegal use 
of drugs'' is used in Sec. 36.209. Its meaning is discussed in the 
preamble for that section.
    ``Disability.'' The definition of the term ``disability'' is 
comparable to the definition of the term ``individual with handicaps'' 
in section 7(8)(B) of the Rehabilitation Act and section 802(h) of the 
Fair Housing Act. The Education and Labor Committee report makes clear 
that the analysis of the term ``individual with handicaps'' by the 
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in its regulations 
implementing section 504 (42 FR 22685 (May 4, 1977)) and the analysis by 
the Department of Housing and Urban Development in its regulation 
implementing the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (54 FR 3232 (Jan. 
23, 1989)) should also apply fully to the term ``disability'' (Education 
and Labor report at 50).
    The use of the term ``disability'' instead of ``handicap'' and the 
term ``individual with a disability'' instead of ``individual with 
handicaps'' represents an effort by the Congress to make use of up-to-
date, currently accepted terminology. The terminology applied to 
individuals with disabilities is a very significant and sensitive issue. 
As with racial and ethnic terms, the choice of words to describe a 
person with a disability is overlaid with stereotypes, patronizing 
attitudes, and other emotional connotations. Many individuals with 
disabilities, and organizations representing such individuals, object to 
the use of such terms as ``handicapped person'' or ``the handicapped.'' 
In other recent legislation, Congress also recognized this shift in 
terminology, e.g., by changing the name of the National Council on the 
Handicapped to the National Council on Disability (Pub. L. 100-630).
    In enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act, Congress concluded 
that it was important for the current legislation to use terminology 
most in line with the sensibilities of most Americans with disabilities. 
No change in definition or substance is intended nor should be 
attributed to this change in phraseology.
    The term ``disability'' means, with respect to an individual--
    (A) A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or 
more of the major life activities of such individual;
    (B) A record of such an impairment; or
    (C) Being regarded as having such an impairment.
    If an individual meets any one of these three tests, he or she is 
considered to be an individual with a disability for purposes of 
coverage under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
    Congress adopted this same basic definition of ``disability,'' first 
used in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and in the Fair Housing 
Amendments Act of 1988, for a number of reasons. It has worked well 
since it was adopted in 1974. There is a substantial body of 
administrative interpretation and judicial precedent on this definition. 
Finally, it would not be possible to guarantee comprehensiveness by 
providing a list of specific disabilities, especially because new 
disorders may be recognized in the future, as they have since the 
definition was first established in 1974.

Test A--A Physical or Mental Impairment That Substantially Limits One or 
          More of the Major Life Activities of Such Individual

    Physical or mental impairment. Under the first test, an individual 
must have a physical or mental impairment. As explained in paragraph (1) 
(i) of the definition, ``impairment'' means any physiological disorder 
or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical

[[Page 690]]

loss affecting one or more of the following body systems: Neurological; 
musculoskeletal; special sense organs (including speech organs that are 
not respiratory, such as vocal cords, soft palate, and tongue); 
respiratory, including speech organs; cardiovascular; reproductive; 
digestive; genitourinary; hemic and lymphatic; skin; and endocrine. It 
also means any mental or psychological disorder, such as mental 
retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and 
specific learning disabilities. This list closely tracks the one used in 
the regulations for section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (see, 
e.g., 45 CFR 84.3(j)(2)(i)).
    Many commenters asked that ``traumatic brain injury'' be added to 
the list in paragraph (1)(i). Traumatic brain injury is already included 
because it is a physiological condition affecting one of the listed body 
systems, i.e., ``neurological.'' Therefore, it was unnecessary for the 
Department to add the term to the regulation.
    It is not possible to include a list of all the specific conditions, 
contagious and noncontagious diseases, or infections that would 
constitute physical or mental impairments because of the difficulty of 
ensuring the comprehensiveness of such a list, particularly in light of 
the fact that other conditions or disorders may be identified in the 
future. However, the list of examples in paragraph (1)(iii) of the 
definition includes: Orthopedic, visual, speech and hearing impairments; 
cerebral palsy; epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, 
cancer, heart disease, diabetes, mental retardation, emotional illness, 
specific learning disabilities, HIV disease (symptomatic or 
asymptomatic), tuberculosis, drug addiction, and alcoholism.
    The examples of ``physical or mental impairments'' in paragraph 
(1)(iii) are the same as those contained in many section 504 
regulations, except for the addition of the phrase ``contagious and 
noncontagious'' to describe the types of diseases and conditions 
included, and the addition of ``HIV disease (symptomatic or 
asymptomatic)'' and ``tuberculosis'' to the list of examples. These 
additions are based on the ADA committee reports, caselaw, and official 
legal opinions interpreting section 504. In School Board of Nassau 
County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273 (1987), a case involving an individual 
with tuberculosis, the Supreme Court held that people with contagious 
diseases are entitled to the protections afforded by section 504. 
Following the Arline decision, this Department's Office of Legal Counsel 
issued a legal opinion that concluded that symptomatic HIV disease is an 
impairment that substantially limits a major life activity; therefore it 
has been included in the definition of disability under this part. The 
opinion also concluded that asymptomatic HIV disease is an impairment 
that substantially limits a major life activity, either because of its 
actual effect on the individual with HIV disease or because the 
reactions of other people to individuals with HIV disease cause such 
individuals to be treated as though they are disabled. See Memorandum 
from Douglas W. Kmiec, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Office of 
Legal Counsel, Department of Justice, to Arthur B. Culvahouse, Jr., 
Counsel to the President (Sept. 27, 1988), reprinted in Hearings on S. 
933, the Americans with Disabilities Act, Before the Subcomm. on the 
Handicapped of the Senate Comm. on Labor and Human Resources, 101st 
Cong., 1st Sess. 346 (1989). The phrase ``symptomatic or asymptomatic'' 
was inserted in the final rule after ``HIV disease'' in response to 
commenters who suggested that the clarification was necessary to give 
full meaning to the Department's opinion.
    Paragraph (1)(iv) of the definition states that the phrase 
``physical or mental impairment'' does not include homosexuality or 
bisexuality. These conditions were never considered impairments under 
other Federal disability laws. Section 511(a) of the statute makes clear 
that they are likewise not to be considered impairments under the 
Americans with Disabilities Act.
    Physical or mental impairment does not include simple physical 
characteristics, such as blue eyes or black hair. Nor does it include 
environmental, cultural, economic, or other disadvantages, such as 
having a prison record, or being poor. Nor is age a disability. 
Similarly, the definition does not include common personality traits 
such as poor judgment or a quick temper where these are not symptoms of 
a mental or psychological disorder. However, a person who has these 
characteristics and also has a physical or mental impairment may be 
considered as having a disability for purposes of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act based on the impairment.
    Substantial limitation of a major life activity. Under Test A, the 
impairment must be one that ``substantially limits a major life 
activity.'' Major life activities include such things as caring for 
one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, 
breathing, learning, and working. For example, a person who is 
paraplegic is substantially limited in the major life activity of 
walking, a person who is blind is substantially limited in the major 
life activity of seeing, and a person who is mentally retarded is 
substantially limited in the major life activity of learning. A person 
with traumatic brain injury is substantially limited in the major life 
activities of caring for one's self, learning, and working because of 
memory deficit, confusion, contextual difficulties, and inability to 
reason appropriately.
    A person is considered an individual with a disability for purposes 
of Test A, the first prong of the definition, when the individual's

[[Page 691]]

important life activities are restricted as to the conditions, manner, 
or duration under which they can be performed in comparison to most 
people. A person with a minor, trivial impairment, such as a simple 
infected finger, is not impaired in a major life activity. A person who 
can walk for 10 miles continuously is not substantially limited in 
walking merely because, on the eleventh mile, he or she begins to 
experience pain, because most people would not be able to walk eleven 
miles without experiencing some discomfort.
    The Department received many comments on the proposed rule's 
inclusion of the word ``temporary'' in the definition of ``disability.'' 
The preamble indicated that impairments are not necessarily excluded 
from the definition of ``disability'' simply because they are temporary, 
but that the duration, or expected duration, of an impairment is one 
factor that may properly be considered in determining whether the 
impairment substantially limits a major life activity. The preamble 
recognized, however, that temporary impairments, such as a broken leg, 
are not commonly regarded as disabilities, and only in rare 
circumstances would the degree of the limitation and its expected 
duration be substantial: Nevertheless, many commenters objected to 
inclusion of the word ``temporary'' both because it is not in the 
statute and because it is not contained in the definition of 
``disability'' set forth in the title I regulations of the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The word ``temporary'' has 
been deleted from the final rule to conform with the statutory language. 
The question of whether a temporary impairment is a disability must be 
resolved on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration both the 
duration (or expected duration) of the impairment and the extent to 
which it actually limits a major life activity of the affected 
individual.
    The question of whether a person has a disability should be assessed 
without regard to the availability of mitigating measures, such as 
reasonable modifications or auxiliary aids and services. For example, a 
person with hearing loss is substantially limited in the major life 
activity of hearing, even though the loss may be improved through the 
use of a hearing aid. Likewise, persons with impairments, such as 
epilepsy or diabetes, that substantially limit a major life activity, 
are covered under the first prong of the definition of disability, even 
if the effects of the impairment are controlled by medication.
    Many commenters asked that environmental illness (also known as 
multiple chemical sensitivity) as well as allergy to cigarette smoke be 
recognized as disabilities. The Department, however, declines to state 
categorically that these types of allergies or sensitivities are 
disabilities, because the determination as to whether an impairment is a 
disability depends on whether, given the particular circumstances at 
issue, the impairment substantially limits one or more major life 
activities (or has a history of, or is regarded as having such an 
effect).
    Sometimes respiratory or neurological functioning is so severely 
affected that an individual will satisfy the requirements to be 
considered disabled under the regulation. Such an individual would be 
entitled to all of the protections afforded by the Act and this part. In 
other cases, individuals may be sensitive to environmental elements or 
to smoke but their sensitivity will not rise to the level needed to 
constitute a disability. For example, their major life activity of 
breathing may be somewhat, but not substantially, impaired. In such 
circumstances, the individuals are not disabled and are not entitled to 
the protections of the statute despite their sensitivity to 
environmental agents.
    In sum, the determination as to whether allergies to cigarette 
smoke, or allergies or sensitivities characterized by the commenters as 
environmental illness are disabilities covered by the regulation must be 
made using the same case-by-case analysis that is applied to all other 
physical or mental impairments. Moreover, the addition of specific 
regulatory provisions relating to environmental illness in the final 
rule would be inappropriate at this time pending future consideration of 
the issue by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance 
Board, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Occupational Safety 
and Health Administration of the Department of Labor.

                 Test B--A Record of Such an Impairment

    This test is intended to cover those who have a record of an 
impairment. As explained in paragraph (3) of the rule's definition of 
disability, this includes a person who has a history of an impairment 
that substantially limited a major life activity, such as someone who 
has recovered from an impairment. It also includes persons who have been 
misclassified as having an impairment.
    This provision is included in the definition in part to protect 
individuals who have recovered from a physical or mental impairment that 
previously substantially limited them in a major life activity. 
Discrimination on the basis of such a past impairment is prohibited. 
Frequently occurring examples of the first group (those who have a 
history of an impairment) are persons with histories of mental or 
emotional illness, heart disease, or cancer; examples of the second 
group (those who have been misclassified as having an impairment) are 
persons who have been misclassified as having mental retardation or 
mental illness.

[[Page 692]]

           Test C--Being Regarded as Having Such an Impairment

    This test, as contained in paragraph (4) of the definition, is 
intended to cover persons who are treated by a private entity or public 
accommodation as having a physical or mental impairment that 
substantially limits a major life activity. It applies when a person is 
treated as if he or she has an impairment that substantially limits a 
major life activity, regardless of whether that person has an 
impairment.
    The Americans with Disabilities Act uses the same ``regarded as'' 
test set forth in the regulations implementing section 504 of the 
Rehabilitation Act. See, e.g., 28 CFR 42.540(k)(2)(iv), which provides:
    (iv) ``Is regarded as having an impairment'' means (A) Has a 
physical or mental impairment that does not substantially limit major 
life activities but that is treated by a recipient as constituting such 
a limitation; (B) Has a physical or mental impairment that substantially 
limits major life activities only as a result of the attitudes of others 
toward such impairment; or (C) Has none of the impairments defined in 
paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section but is treated by a recipient as 
having such an impairment.
    The perception of the private entity or public accommodation is a 
key element of this test. A person who perceives himself or herself to 
have an impairment, but does not have an impairment, and is not treated 
as if he or she has an impairment, is not protected under this test. A 
person would be covered under this test if a restaurant refused to serve 
that person because of a fear of ``negative reactions'' of others to 
that person. A person would also be covered if a public accommodation 
refused to serve a patron because it perceived that the patron had an 
impairment that limited his or her enjoyment of the goods or services 
being offered.
    For example, persons with severe burns often encounter 
discrimination in community activities, resulting in substantial 
limitation of major life activities. These persons would be covered 
under this test based on the attitudes of others towards the impairment, 
even if they did not view themselves as ``impaired.''
    The rationale for this third test, as used in the Rehabilitation Act 
of 1973, was articulated by the Supreme Court in Arline, 480 U.S. 273 
(1987). The Court noted that, although an individual may have an 
impairment that does not in fact substantially limit a major life 
activity, the reaction of others may prove just as disabling. ``Such an 
impairment might not diminish a person's physical or mental 
capabilities, but could nevertheless substantially limit that person's 
ability to work as a result of the negative reactions of others to the 
impairment.'' Id. at 283. The Court concluded that, by including this 
test in the Rehabilitation Act's definition, ``Congress acknowledged 
that society's accumulated myths and fears about disability and disease 
are as handicapping as are the physical limitations that flow from 
actual impairment.'' Id. at 284.
    Thus, a person who is not allowed into a public accommodation 
because of the myths, fears, and stereotypes associated with 
disabilities would be covered under this third test whether or not the 
person's physical or mental condition would be considered a disability 
under the first or second test in the definition.
    If a person is refused admittance on the basis of an actual or 
perceived physical or mental condition, and the public accommodation can 
articulate no legitimate reason for the refusal (such as failure to meet 
eligibility criteria), a perceived concern about admitting persons with 
disabilities could be inferred and the individual would qualify for 
coverage under the ``regarded as'' test. A person who is covered because 
of being regarded as having an impairment is not required to show that 
the public accommodation's perception is inaccurate (e.g., that he will 
be accepted by others, or that insurance rates will not increase) in 
order to be admitted to the public accommodation.
    Paragraph (5) of the definition lists certain conditions that are 
not included within the definition of ``disability.'' The excluded 
conditions are: transvestism, transsexualism, pedophilia, exhibitionism, 
voyeurism, gender identity disorders not resulting from physical 
impairments, other sexual behavior disorders, compulsive gambling, 
kleptomania, pyromania, and psychoactive substance use disorders 
resulting from current illegal use of drugs. Unlike homosexuality and 
bisexuality, which are not considered impairments under either the 
Americans with Disabilities Act (see the definition of ``disability,'' 
paragraph (1)(iv)) or section 504, the conditions listed in paragraph 
(5), except for transvestism, are not necessarily excluded as 
impairments under section 504. (Transvestism was excluded from the 
definition of disability for section 504 by the Fair Housing Amendments 
Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-430, Sec. 6(b).) The phrase ``current illegal 
use of drugs'' used in this definition is explained in the preamble to 
Sec. 36.209.
    ``Drug.'' The definition of the term ``drug'' is taken from section 
510(d)(2) of the ADA.
    ``Facility.'' ``Facility'' means all or any portion of buildings, 
structures, sites, complexes, equipment, rolling stock or other 
conveyances, roads, walks, passageways, parking lots, or other real or 
personal property, including the site where the building, property, 
structure, or equipment is located. Committee reports made clear that 
the definition of facility was drawn from the definition of facility in 
current Federal regulations (see, e.g., Education and Labor report

[[Page 693]]

at 114). It includes both indoor and outdoor areas where human-
constructed improvements, structures, equipment, or property have been 
added to the natural environment.
    The term ``rolling stock or other conveyances'' was not included in 
the definition of facility in the proposed rule. However, commenters 
raised questions about the applicability of this part to places of 
public accommodation operated in mobile facilities (such as cruise 
ships, floating restaurants, or mobile health units). Those places of 
public accommodation are covered under this part, and would be included 
in the definition of ``facility.'' Thus the requirements of subparts B 
and C would apply to those places of public accommodation. For example, 
a covered entity could not discriminate on the basis of disability in 
the full and equal enjoyment of the facilities (Sec. 36.201). 
Similarly, a cruise line could not apply eligibility criteria to 
potential passengers in a manner that would screen out individuals with 
disabilities, unless the criteria are ``necessary,'' as provided in 
Sec. 36.301.
    However, standards for new construction and alterations of such 
facilities are not yet included in the Americans with Disabilities Act 
Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (ADAAG) adopted by 
Sec. 36.406 and incorporated in appendix A. The Department therefore 
will not interpret the new construction and alterations provisions of 
subpart D to apply to the types of facilities discussed here, pending 
further development of specific requirements.
    Requirements pertaining to accessible transportation services 
provided by public accommodations are included in Sec. 36.310 of this 
part; standards pertaining to accessible vehicles will be issued by the 
Secretary of Transportation pursuant to section 306 of the Act, and will 
be codified at 49 CFR part 37.
    A public accommodation has obligations under this rule with respect 
to a cruise ship to the extent that its operations are subject to the 
laws of the United States.
    The definition of ``facility'' only includes the site over which the 
private entity may exercise control or on which a place of public 
accommodation or a commercial facility is located. It does not include, 
for example, adjacent roads or walks controlled by a public entity that 
is not subject to this part. Public entities are subject to the 
requirements of title II of the Act. The Department's regulation 
implementing title II, which will be codified at 28 CFR part 35, 
addresses the obligations of public entities to ensure accessibility by 
providing curb ramps at pedestrian walkways.
    ``Illegal use of drugs.'' The definition of ``illegal use of drugs'' 
is taken from section 510(d)(1) of the Act and clarifies that the term 
includes the illegal use of one or more drugs.
    ``Individual with a disability'' means a person who has a disability 
but does not include an individual who is currently illegally using 
drugs, when the public accommodation acts on the basis of such use. The 
phrase ``current illegal use of drugs'' is explained in the preamble to 
Sec. 36.209.
    ``Place of public accommodation.'' The term ``place of public 
accommodation'' is an adaptation of the statutory definition of ``public 
accommodation'' in section 301(7) of the ADA and appears as an element 
of the regulatory definition of public accommodation. The final rule 
defines ``place of public accommodation'' as a facility, operated by a 
private entity, whose operations affect commerce and fall within at 
least one of 12 specified categories. The term ``public accommodation,'' 
on the other hand, is reserved by the final rule for the private entity 
that owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public 
accommodation. It is the public accommodation, and not the place of 
public accommodation, that is subject to the regulation's 
nondiscrimination requirements. Placing the obligation not to 
discriminate on the public accommodation, as defined in the rule, is 
consistent with section 302(a) of the ADA, which places the obligation 
not to discriminate on any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or 
operates a place of public accommodation.
    Facilities operated by government agencies or other public entities 
as defined in this section do not qualify as places of public 
accommodation. The actions of public entities are governed by title II 
of the ADA and will be subject to regulations issued by the Department 
of Justice under that title. The receipt of government assistance by a 
private entity does not by itself preclude a facility from being 
considered as a place of public accommodation.
    The definition of place of public accommodation incorporates the 12 
categories of facilities represented in the statutory definition of 
public accommodation in section 301(7) of the ADA:
    1. Places of lodging.
    2. Establishments serving food or drink.
    3. Places of exhibition or entertainment.
    4. Places of public gathering.
    5. Sales or rental establishments.
    6. Service establishments.
    7. Stations used for specified public transportation.
    8. Places of public display or collection.
    9. Places of recreation.
    10. Places of education.
    11. Social service center establishments.
    12. Places of exercise or recreation.
    In order to be a place of public accommodation, a facility must be 
operated by a private entity, its operations must affect commerce, and 
it must fall within one of these 12

[[Page 694]]

categories. While the list of categories is exhaustive, the 
representative examples of facilities within each category are not. 
Within each category only a few examples are given. The category of 
social service center establishments would include not only the types of 
establishments listed, day care centers, senior citizen centers, 
homeless shelters, food banks, adoption agencies, but also 
establishments such as substance abuse treatment centers, rape crisis 
centers, and halfway houses. As another example, the category of sales 
or rental establishments would include an innumerable array of 
facilities that would sweep far beyond the few examples given in the 
regulation. For example, other retail or wholesale establishments 
selling or renting items, such as bookstores, videotape rental stores, 
car rental establishment, pet stores, and jewelry stores would also be 
covered under this category, even though they are not specifically 
listed.
    Several commenters requested clarification as to the coverage of 
wholesale establishments under the category of ``sales or rental 
establishments.'' The Department intends for wholesale establishments to 
be covered under this category as places of public accommodation except 
in cases where they sell exclusively to other businesses and not to 
individuals. For example, a company that grows food produce and supplies 
its crops exclusively to food processing corporations on a wholesale 
basis does not become a public accommodation because of these 
transactions. If this company operates a road side stand where its crops 
are sold to the public, the road side stand would be a sales 
establishment covered by the ADA. Conversely, a sales establishment that 
markets its goods as ``wholesale to the public'' and sells to 
individuals would not be exempt from ADA coverage despite its use of the 
word ``wholesale'' as a marketing technique.
    Of course, a company that operates a place of public accommodation 
is subject to this part only in the operation of that place of public 
accommodation. In the example given above, the wholesale produce company 
that operates a road side stand would be a public accommodation only for 
the purposes of the operation of that stand. The company would be 
prohibited from discriminating on the basis of disability in the 
operation of the road side stand, and it would be required to remove 
barriers to physical access to the extent that it is readily achievable 
to do so (see Sec. 36.304); however, in the event that it is not 
readily achievable to remove barriers, for example, by replacing a 
gravel surface or regrading the area around the stand to permit access 
by persons with mobility impairments, the company could meet its 
obligations through alternative methods of making its goods available, 
such as delivering produce to a customer in his or her car (see Sec. 
36.305). The concepts of readily achievable barrier removal and 
alternatives to barrier removal are discussed further in the preamble 
discussion of Sec. Sec. 36.304 and 36.305.
    Even if a facility does not fall within one of the 12 categories, 
and therefore does not qualify as a place of public accommodation, it 
still may be a commercial facility as defined in Sec. 36.104 and be 
subject to the new construction and alterations requirements of subpart 
D.
    A number of commenters questioned the treatment of residential 
hotels and other residential facilities in the Department's proposed 
rule. These commenters were essentially seeking resolution of the 
relationship between the Fair Housing Act and the ADA concerning 
facilities that are both residential in nature and engage in activities 
that would cause them to be classified as ``places of public 
accommodation'' under the ADA. The ADA's express exemption relating to 
the Fair Housing Act applies only to ``commercial facilities'' and not 
to ``places of public accommodation.''
    A facility whose operations affect interstate commerce is a place of 
public accommodation for purposes of the ADA to the extent that its 
operations include those types of activities engaged in or services 
provided by the facilities contained on the list of 12 categories in 
section 301(7) of the ADA. Thus, a facility that provides social 
services would be considered a ``social service center establishment.'' 
Similarly, the category ``places of lodging'' would exclude solely 
residential facilities because the nature of a place of lodging 
contemplates the use of the facility for short-term stays.
    Many facilities, however, are mixed use facilities. For example, in 
a large hotel that has a separate residential apartment wing, the 
residential wing would not be covered by the ADA because of the nature 
of the occupancy of that part of the facility. This residential wing 
would, however, be covered by the Fair Housing Act. The separate 
nonresidential accommodations in the rest of the hotel would be a place 
of lodging, and thus a public accommodation subject to the requirements 
of this final rule. If a hotel allows both residential and short-term 
stays, but does not allocate space for these different uses in separate, 
discrete units, both the ADA and the Fair Housing Act may apply to the 
facility. Such determinations will need to be made on a case-by-case 
basis. Any place of lodging of the type described in paragraph (1) of 
the definition of place of public accommodation and that is an 
establishment located within a building that contains not more than five 
rooms for rent or hire and is actually occupied by the proprietor of the 
establishment as his or her residence is not covered by the ADA. (This 
exclusion from coverage does not apply to other categories of public 
accommodations, for example, professional offices or homeless

[[Page 695]]

shelters, that are located in a building that is also occupied as a 
private residence.)
    A number of commenters noted that the term ``residential hotel'' may 
also apply to a type of hotel commonly known as a ``single room 
occupancy hotel.'' Although such hotels or portions of such hotels may 
fall under the Fair Housing Act when operated or used as long-term 
residences, they are also considered ``places of lodging'' under the ADA 
when guests of such hotels are free to use them on a short-term basis. 
In addition, ``single room occupancy hotels'' may provide social 
services to their guests, often through the operation of Federal or 
State grant programs. In such a situation, the facility would be 
considered a ``social service center establishment'' and thus covered by 
the ADA as a place of public accommodation, regardless of the length of 
stay of the occupants.
    A similar analysis would also be applied to other residential 
facilities that provide social services, including homeless shelters, 
shelters for people seeking refuge from domestic violence, nursing 
homes, residential care facilities, and other facilities where persons 
may reside for varying lengths of time. Such facilities should be 
analyzed under the Fair Housing Act to determine the application of that 
statute. The ADA, however, requires a separate and independent analysis. 
For example, if the facility, or a portion of the facility, is intended 
for or permits short-term stays, or if it can appropriately be 
categorized as a service establishment or as a social service 
establishment, then the facility or that portion of the facility used 
for the covered purpose is a place of public accommodation under the 
ADA. For example, a homeless shelter that is intended and used only for 
long-term residential stays and that does not provide social services to 
its residents would not be covered as a place of public accommodation. 
However, if this facility permitted short-term stays or provided social 
services to its residents, it would be covered under the ADA either as a 
``place of lodging'' or as a ``social service center establishment,'' or 
as both.
    A private home, by itself, does not fall within any of the 12 
categories. However, it can be covered as a place of public 
accommodation to the extent that it is used as a facility that would 
fall within one of the 12 categories. For example, if a professional 
office of a dentist, doctor, or psychologist is located in a private 
home, the portion of the home dedicated to office use (including areas 
used both for the residence and the office, e.g., the entrance to the 
home that is also used as the entrance to the professional office) would 
be considered a place of public accommodation. Places of public 
accommodation located in residential facilities are specifically 
addressed in Sec. 36.207.
    If a tour of a commercial facility that is not otherwise a place of 
public accommodation, such as, for example, a factory or a movie studio 
production set, is open to the general public, the route followed by the 
tour is a place of public accommodation and the tour must be operated in 
accordance with the rule's requirements for public accommodations. The 
place of public accommodation defined by the tour does not include those 
portions of the commercial facility that are merely viewed from the tour 
route. Hence, the barrier removal requirements of Sec. 36.304 only 
apply to the physical route followed by the tour participants and not to 
work stations or other areas that are merely adjacent to, or within view 
of, the tour route. If the tour is not open to the general public, but 
rather is conducted, for example, for selected business colleagues, 
partners, customers, or consultants, the tour route is not a place of 
public accommodation and the tour is not subject to the requirements for 
public accommodations.
    Public accommodations that receive Federal financial assistance are 
subject to the requirements of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act as 
well as the requirements of the ADA.
    Private schools, including elementary and secondary schools, are 
covered by the rule as places of public accommodation. The rule itself, 
however, does not require a private school to provide a free appropriate 
education or develop an individualized education program in accordance 
with regulations of the Department of Education implementing section 504 
of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (34 CFR part 104), and 
regulations implementing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act 
(34 CFR part 300). The receipt of Federal assistance by a private 
school, however, would trigger application of the Department of 
Education's regulations to the extent mandated by the particular type of 
assistance received.
    ``Private club.'' The term ``private club'' is defined in accordance 
with section 307 of the ADA as a private club or establishment exempted 
from coverage under title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title II 
of the 1964 Act exempts any ``private club or other establishment not in 
fact open to the public, except to the extent that the facilities of 
such establishment are made available to the customers or patrons of [a 
place of public accommodation as defined in title II].'' The rule, 
therefore, as reflected in Sec. 36.102(e) of the application section, 
limits the coverage of private clubs accordingly. The obligations of a 
private club that rents space to any other private entity for the 
operation of a place of public accommodation are discussed further in 
connection with Sec. 36.201.
    In determining whether a private entity qualifies as a private club 
under title II, courts have considered such factors as the degree of 
member control of club operations, the selectivity of the membership 
selection

[[Page 696]]

process, whether substantial membership fees are charged, whether the 
entity is operated on a nonprofit basis, the extent to which the 
facilities are open to the public, the degree of public funding, and 
whether the club was created specifically to avoid compliance with the 
Civil Rights Act. See e.g., Tillman v. Wheaton-Haven Recreation Ass'n, 
410 U.S. 431 (1973); Daniel v. Paul, 395 U.S. 298 (1969); Olzman v. Lake 
Hills Swim Club, Inc., 495 F.2d 1333 (2d Cir. 1974); Anderson v. Pass 
Christian Isles Golf Club, Inc., 488 F.2d 855 (5th Cir. 1974); Smith v. 
YMCA, 462 F.2d 634 (5th Cir. 1972); Stout v. YMCA, 404 F.2d 687 (5th 
Cir. 1968); United States v. Richberg, 398 F.2d 523 (5th Cir. 1968); 
Nesmith v. YMCA, 397 F.2d 96 (4th Cir. 1968); United States v. Lansdowne 
Swim Club, 713 F. Supp. 785 (E.D. Pa. 1989); Durham v. Red Lake Fishing 
and Hunting Club, Inc., 666 F. Supp. 954 (W.D. Tex. 1987); New York v. 
Ocean Club, Inc., 602 F. Supp. 489 (E.D.N.Y. 1984); Brown v. Loudoun 
Golf and Country Club, Inc., 573 F. Supp. 399 (E.D. Va. 1983); United 
States v. Trustees of Fraternal Order of Eagles, 472 F. Supp. 1174 (E.D. 
Wis. 1979); Cornelius v. Benevolent Protective Order of Elks, 382 F. 
Supp. 1182 (D. Conn. 1974).
    ``Private entity.'' The term ``private entity'' is defined as any 
individual or entity other than a public entity. It is used as part of 
the definition of ``public accommodation'' in this section.
    The definition adds ``individual'' to the statutory definition of 
private entity (see section 301(6) of the ADA). This addition clarifies 
that an individual may be a private entity and, therefore, may be 
considered a public accommodation if he or she owns, leases (or leases 
to), or operates a place of public accommodation. The explicit inclusion 
of individuals under the definition of private entity is consistent with 
section 302(a) of the ADA, which broadly prohibits discrimination on the 
basis of disability by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or 
operates a place of public accommodation.
    ``Public accommodation.'' The term ``public accommodation'' means a 
private entity that owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of 
public accommodation. The regulatory term, ``public accommodation,'' 
corresponds to the statutory term, ``person,'' in section 302(a) of the 
ADA. The ADA prohibits discrimination ``by any person who owns, leases 
(or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.'' The text 
of the regulation consequently places the ADA's nondiscrimination 
obligations on ``public accommodations'' rather than on ``persons'' or 
on ``places of public accommodation.''
    As stated in Sec. 36.102(b)(2), the requirements of subparts B and 
C obligate a public accommodation only with respect to the operations of 
a place of public accommodation. A public accommodation must also meet 
the requirements of subpart D with respect to facilities used as, or 
designed or constructed for use as, places of public accommodation or 
commercial facilities.
    ``Public entity.'' The term ``public entity'' is defined in 
accordance with section 201(1) of the ADA as any State or local 
government; any department, agency, special purpose district, or other 
instrumentality of a State or States or local government; and the 
National Railroad Passenger Corporation, and any commuter authority (as 
defined in section 103(8) of the Rail Passenger Service Act). It is used 
in the definition of ``private entity'' in Sec. 36.104. Public entities 
are excluded from the definition of private entity and therefore cannot 
qualify as public accommodations under this regulation. However, the 
actions of public entities are covered by title II of the ADA and by the 
Department's title II regulations codified at 28 CFR part 35.
    ``Qualified interpreter.'' The Department received substantial 
comment regarding the lack of a definition of ``qualified interpreter.'' 
The proposed rule defined auxiliary aids and services to include the 
statutory term, ``qualified interpreters'' (Sec. 36.303(b)), but did 
not define that term. Section 36.303 requires the use of a qualified 
interpreter where necessary to achieve effective communication, unless 
an undue burden or fundamental alteration would result. Commenters 
stated that a lack of guidance on what the term means would create 
confusion among those trying to secure interpreting services and often 
result in less than effective communication.
    Many commenters were concerned that, without clear guidance on the 
issue of ``qualified'' interpreter, the rule would be interpreted to 
mean ``available, rather than qualified'' interpreters. Some claimed 
that few public accommodations would understand the difference between a 
qualified interpreter and a person who simply knows a few signs or how 
to fingerspell.
    In order to clarify what is meant by ``qualified interpreter'' the 
Department has added a definition of the term to the final rule. A 
qualified interpreter means an interpreter who is able to interpret 
effectively, accurately, and impartially both receptively and 
expressively, using any necessary specialized vocabulary. This 
definition focuses on the actual ability of the interpreter in a 
particular interpreting context to facilitate effective communication 
between the public accommodation and the individual with disabilities.
    Public comment also revealed that public accommodations have at 
times asked persons who are deaf to provide family members or friends to 
interpret. In certain circumstances, notwithstanding that the family 
member or friend is able to interpret or is a certified interpreter, the 
family member or friend may not be qualified to render the necessary 
interpretation because of factors such as emotional or personal 
involvement

[[Page 697]]

or considerations of confidentiality that may adversely affect the 
ability to interpret ``effectively, accurately, and impartially.''
    ``Readily achievable.'' The definition of ``readily achievable'' 
follows the statutory definition of that term in section 301(9) of the 
ADA. Readily achievable means easily accomplishable and able to be 
carried out without much difficulty or expense. The term is used as a 
limitation on the obligation to remove barriers under Sec. Sec. 
36.304(a), 36.305(a), 36.308(a), and 36.310(b). Further discussion of 
the meaning and application of the term ``readily achievable'' may be 
found in the preamble section for Sec. 36.304.
    The definition lists factors to be considered in determining whether 
barrier removal is readily achievable in any particular circumstance. A 
significant number of commenters objected to Sec. 36.306 of the 
proposed rule, which listed identical factors to be considered for 
determining ``readily achievable'' and ``undue burden'' together in one 
section. They asserted that providing a consolidated section blurred the 
distinction between the level of effort required by a public 
accommodation under the two standards. The readily achievable standard 
is a ``lower'' standard than the ``undue burden'' standard in terms of 
the level of effort required, but the factors used in determining 
whether an action is readily achievable or would result in an undue 
burden are identical (See Education and Labor report at 109). Although 
the preamble to the proposed rule clearly delineated the relationship 
between the two standards, to eliminate any confusion the Department has 
deleted Sec. 36.306 of the proposed rule. That section, in any event, 
as other commenters noted, had merely repeated the lists of factors 
contained in the definitions of readily achievable and undue burden.
    The list of factors included in the definition is derived from 
section 301(9) of the ADA. It reflects the congressional intention that 
a wide range of factors be considered in determining whether an action 
is readily achievable. It also takes into account that many local 
facilities are owned or operated by parent corporations or entities that 
conduct operations at many different sites. This section makes clear 
that, in some instances, resources beyond those of the local facility 
where the barrier must be removed may be relevant in determining whether 
an action is readily achievable. One must also evaluate the degree to 
which any parent entity has resources that may be allocated to the local 
facility.
    The statutory list of factors in section 301(9) of the Act uses the 
term ``covered entity'' to refer to the larger entity of which a 
particular facility may be a part. ``Covered entity'' is not a defined 
term in the ADA and is not used consistently throughout the Act. The 
definition, therefore, substitutes the term ``parent entity'' in place 
of ``covered entity'' in paragraphs (3), (4), and (5) when referring to 
the larger private entity whose overall resources may be taken into 
account. This usage is consistent with the House Judiciary Committee's 
use of the term ``parent company'' to describe the larger entity of 
which the local facility is a part (H.R. Rep. No. 485, 101st Cong., 2d 
Sess., pt. 3, at 40-41, 54-55 (1990) (hereinafter ``Judiciary 
report'')).
    A number of commenters asked for more specific guidance as to when 
and how the resources of a parent corporation or entity are to be taken 
into account in determining what is readily achievable. The Department 
believes that this complex issue is most appropriately resolved on a 
case-by-case basis. As the comments reflect, there is a wide variety of 
possible relationships between the site in question and any parent 
corporation or other entity. It would be unwise to posit legal 
ramifications under the ADA of even generic relationships (e.g., banks 
involved in foreclosures or insurance companies operating as trustees or 
in other similar fiduciary relationships), because any analysis will 
depend so completely on the detailed fact situations and the exact 
nature of the legal relationships involved. The final rule does, 
however, reorder the factors to be considered. This shift and the 
addition of the phrase ``if applicable'' make clear that the line of 
inquiry concerning factors will start at the site involved in the action 
itself. This change emphasizes that the overall resources, size, and 
operations of the parent corporation or entity should be considered to 
the extent appropriate in light of ``the geographic separateness, and 
the administrative or fiscal relationship of the site or sites in 
question to any parent corporation or entity.''
    Although some commenters sought more specific numerical guidance on 
the definition of readily achievable, the Department has declined to 
establish in the final rule any kind of numerical formula for 
determining whether an action is readily achievable. It would be 
difficult to devise a specific ceiling on compliance costs that would 
take into account the vast diversity of enterprises covered by the ADA's 
public accommodations requirements and the economic situation that any 
particular entity would find itself in at any moment. The final rule, 
therefore, implements the flexible case-by-case approach chosen by 
Congress.
    A number of commenters requested that security considerations be 
explicitly recognized as a factor in determining whether a barrier 
removal action is readily achievable. The Department believes that 
legitimate safety requirements, including crime prevention measures, may 
be taken into account so long as they are based on actual risks and are 
necessary for safe operation of the public accommodation. This point has 
been included in the definition.

[[Page 698]]

    Some commenters urged the Department not to consider acts of barrier 
removal in complete isolation from each other in determining whether 
they are readily achievable. The Department believes that it is 
appropriate to consider the cost of other barrier removal actions as one 
factor in determining whether a measure is readily achievable.
    ``Religious entity.'' The term ``religious entity'' is defined in 
accordance with section 307 of the ADA as a religious organization or 
entity controlled by a religious organization, including a place of 
worship. Section 36.102(e) of the rule states that the rule does not 
apply to any religious entity.
    The ADA's exemption of religious organizations and religious 
entities controlled by religious organizations is very broad, 
encompassing a wide variety of situations. Religious organizations and 
entities controlled by religious organizations have no obligations under 
the ADA. Even when a religious organization carries out activities that 
would othervise make it a public accommodation, the religious 
organization is exempt from ADA coverage. Thus, if a church itself 
operates a day care center, a nursing home, a private school, or a 
diocesan school system, the operations of the center, home, school, or 
schools would not be subject to the requirements of the ADA or this 
part. The religious entity would not lose its exemption merely because 
the services provided were open to the general public. The test is 
whether the church or other religious organization operates the public 
accommodation, not which individuals receive the public accommodation's 
services.
    Religious entities that are controlled by religious organizations 
are also exempt from the ADA's requirements. Many religious 
organizations in the United States use lay boards and other secular or 
corporate mechanisms to operate schools and an array of social services. 
The use of a lay board or other mechanism does not itself remove the 
ADA's religious exemption. Thus, a parochial school, having religious 
doctrine in its curriculum and sponsored by a religious order, could be 
exempt either as a religious organization or as an entity controlled by 
a religious organization, even if it has a lay board. The test remains a 
factual one--whether the church or other religious organization controls 
the operations of the school or of the service or whether the school or 
service is itself a religious organization.
    Although a religious organization or a religious entity that is 
controlled by a religious organization has no obligations under the 
rule, a public accommodation that is not itself a religious 
organization, but that operates a place of public accommodation in 
leased space on the property of a religious entity, which is not a place 
of worship, is subject to the rule's requirements if it is not under 
control of a religious organization. When a church rents meeting space, 
which is not a place of worship, to a local community group or to a 
private, independent day care center, the ADA applies to the activities 
of the local community group and day care center if a lease exists and 
consideration is paid.
    ``Service animal.'' The term ``service animal'' encompasses any 
guide dog, signal dog, or other animal individually trained to provide 
assistance to an individual with a disability. The term is used in Sec. 
36.302(c), which requires public accommodations generally to modify 
policies, practices, and procedures to accommodate the use of service 
animals in places of public accommodation.
    ``Specified public transportation.'' The definition of ``specified 
public transportation'' is identical to the statutory definition in 
section 301(10) of the ADA. The term means transportation by bus, rail, 
or any other conveyance (other than by aircraft) that provides the 
general public with general or special service (including charter 
service) on a regular and continuing basis. It is used in category (7) 
of the definition of ``place of public accommodation,'' which includes 
stations used for specified public transportation.
    The effect of this definition, which excludes transportation by 
aircraft, is that it excludes privately operated airports from coverage 
as places of public accommodation. However, places of public 
accommodation located within airports would be covered by this part. 
Airports that are operated by public entities are covered by title II of 
the ADA and, if they are operated as part of a program receiving Federal 
financial assistance, by section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. 
Privately operated airports are similarly covered by section 504 if they 
are operated as part of a program receiving Federal financial 
assistance. The operations of any portion of any airport that are under 
the control of an air carrier are covered by the Air Carrier Access Act. 
In addition, airports are covered as commercial facilities under this 
rule.
    ``State.'' The definition of ``State'' is identical to the statutory 
definition in section 3(3) of the ADA. The term is used in the 
definitions of ``commerce'' and ``public entity'' in Sec. 36.104.
    ``Undue burden.'' The definition of ``undue burden'' is analogous to 
the statutory definition of ``undue hardship'' in employment under 
section 101(10) of the ADA. The term undue burden means ``significant 
difficulty or expense'' and serves as a limitation on the obligation to 
provide auxiliary aids and services under Sec. 36.303 and Sec. Sec. 
36.309 (b)(3) and (c)(3). Further discussion of the meaning and 
application of the term undue burden may be found in the preamble 
discussion of Sec. 36.303.
    The definition lists factors considered in determining whether 
provision of an auxiliary aid or service in any particular circumstance 
would result in an undue burden.

[[Page 699]]

The factors to be considered in determining whether an action would 
result in an undue burden are identical to those to be considered in 
determining whether an action is readily achievable. However, ``readily 
achievable'' is a lower standard than ``undue burden'' in that it 
requires a lower level of effort on the part of the public accommodation 
(see Education and Labor report at 109).
    Further analysis of the factors to be considered in determining 
undue burden may be found in the preamble discussion of the definition 
of the term ``readily achievable.''

                     Subpart B--General Requirements

    Subpart B includes general prohibitions restricting a public 
accommodation from discriminating against people with disabilities by 
denying them the opportunity to benefit from goods or services, by 
giving them unequal goods or services, or by giving them different or 
separate goods or services. These general prohibitions are patterned 
after the basic, general prohibitions that exist in other civil rights 
laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, sex, color, 
religion, or national origin.

                         Section 36.201 General

    Section 36.201(a) contains the general rule that prohibits 
discrimination on the basis of disability in the full and equal 
enjoyment of goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and 
accommodations of any place of public accommodation.
    Full and equal enjoyment means the right to participate and to have 
an equal opportunity to obtain the same results as others to the extent 
possible with such accommodations as may be required by the Act and 
these regulations. It does not mean that an individual with a disability 
must achieve an identical result or level of achievement as persons 
without a disability. For example, an exercise class cannot exclude a 
person who uses a wheelchair because he or she cannot do all of the 
exercises and derive the same result from the class as persons without a 
disability.
    Section 302(a) of the ADA states that the prohibition against 
discrimination applies to ``any person who owns, leases (or leases to), 
or operates a place of public accommodation,'' and this language is 
reflected in Sec. 36.201(a). The coverage is quite extensive and would 
include sublessees, management companies, and any other entity that 
owns, leases, leases to, or operates a place of public accommodation, 
even if the operation is only for a short time.
    The first sentence of paragraph (b) of Sec. 36.201 reiterates the 
general principle that both the landlord that owns the building that 
houses the place of public accommodation, as well as the tenant that 
owns or operates the place of public accommodation, are public 
accommodations subject to the requirements of this part. Although the 
statutory language could be interpreted as placing equal responsibility 
on all private entities, whether lessor, lessee, or operator of a public 
accommodation, the committee reports suggest that liability may be 
allocated. Section 36.201(b) of that section of the proposed rule 
attempted to allocate liability in the regulation itself. Paragraph 
(b)(2) of that section made a specific allocation of liability for the 
obligation to take readily achievable measures to remove barriers, and 
paragraph (b)(3) made a specific allocation for the obligation to 
provide auxiliary aids.
    Numerous commenters pointed out that these allocations would not 
apply in all situations. Some asserted that paragraph (b)(2) of the 
proposed rule only addressed the situation when a lease gave the tenant 
the right to make alterations with permission of the landlord, but 
failed to address other types of leases, e.g., those that are silent on 
the right to make alterations, or those in which the landlord is not 
permitted to enter a tenant's premises to make alterations. Several 
commenters noted that many leases contain other clauses more relevant to 
the ADA than the alterations clause. For example, many leases contain a 
``compliance clause,'' a clause which allocates responsibility to a 
particular party for compliance with all relevant Federal, State, and 
local laws. Many commenters pointed out various types of relationships 
that were left unaddressed by the regulation, e.g., sale and leaseback 
arrangements where the landlord is a financial institution with no 
control or responsibility for the building; franchises; subleases; and 
management companies which, at least in the hotel industry, often have 
control over operations but are unable to make modifications to the 
premises.
    Some commenters raised specific questions as to how the barrier 
removal allocation would work as a practical matter. Paragraph (b)(2) of 
the proposed rule provided that the burden of making readily achievable 
modifications within the tenant's place of public accommodation would 
shift to the landlord when the modifications were not readily achievable 
for the tenant or when the landlord denied a tenant's request for 
permission to make such modifications. Commenters noted that the rule 
did not specify exactly when the burden would actually shift from tenant 
to landlord and whether the landlord would have to accept a tenant's 
word that a particular action is not readily achievable. Others 
questioned if the tenant should be obligated to use alternative methods 
of barrier removal before the burden shifts. In light of the fact that 
readily achievable removal of barriers can include such actions as 
moving of racks and displays, some commenters doubted the 
appropriateness of requiring a

[[Page 700]]

landlord to become involved in day-to-day operations of its tenants' 
businesses.
    The Department received widely differing comments in response to the 
preamble question asking whether landlord and tenant obligations should 
vary depending on the length of time remaining on an existing lease. 
Many suggested that tenants should have no responsibilities in ``shorter 
leases,'' which commenters defined as ranging anywhere from 90 days to 
three years. Other commenters pointed out that the time remaining on the 
lease should not be a factor in the rule's allocation of 
responsibilities, but is relevant in determining what is readily 
achievable for the tenant. The Department agrees with this latter 
approach and will interpret the rule in that manner.
    In recognition of the somewhat limited applicability of the 
allocation scheme contained in the proposed rule, paragraphs (b)(2) and 
(b)(3) have been deleted from the final rule. The Department has 
substituted instead a statement that allocation of responsibility as 
between the parties for taking readily achievable measures to remove 
barriers and to provide auxiliary aids and services both in common areas 
and within places of public accommodation may be determined by the lease 
or other contractual relationships between the parties. The ADA was not 
intended to change existing landlord/tenant responsibilities as set 
forth in the lease. By deleting specific provisions from the rule, the 
Department gives full recognition to this principle. As between the 
landlord and tenant, the extent of responsibility for particular 
obligations may be, and in many cases probably will be, determined by 
contract.
    The suggested allocation of responsibilities contained in the 
proposed rule may be used if appropriate in a particular situation. 
Thus, the landlord would generally be held responsible for making 
readily achievable changes and providing auxiliary aids and services in 
common areas and for modifying policies, practices, or procedures 
applicable to all tenants, and the tenant would generally be responsible 
for readily achievable changes, provision of auxiliary aids, and 
modification of policies within its own place of public accommodation.
    Many commenters objected to the proposed rule's allocation of 
responsibility for providing auxiliary aids and services solely to the 
tenant, pointing out that this exclusive allocation may not be 
appropriate in the case of larger public accommodations that operate 
their businesses by renting space out to smaller public accommodations. 
For example, large theaters often rent to smaller traveling companies 
and hospitals often rely on independent contractors to provide 
childbirth classes. Groups representing persons with disabilities 
objected to the proposed rule because, in their view, it permitted the 
large theater or hospital to evade ADA responsibilities by leasing to 
independent smaller entities. They suggested that these types of public 
accommodations are not really landlords because they are in the business 
of providing a service, rather than renting space, as in the case of a 
shopping center or office building landlord. These commenters believed 
that responsibility for providing auxiliary aids should shift to the 
landlord, if the landlord relies on a smaller public accommodation or 
independent contractor to provide services closely related to those of 
the larger public accommodation, and if the needed auxiliary aids prove 
to be an undue burden for the smaller public accommodation. The final 
rule no longer lists specific allocations to specific parties but, 
rather, leaves allocation of responsibilities to the lease negotiations. 
Parties are, therefore, free to allocate the responsibility for 
auxiliary aids.
    Section 36.201(b)(4) of the proposed rule, which provided that 
alterations by a tenant on its own premises do not trigger a path of 
travel obligation on the landlord, has been moved to Sec. 36.403(d) of 
the final rule.
    An entity that is not in and of itself a public accommodation, such 
as a trade association or performing artist, may become a public 
accommodation when it leases space for a conference or performance at a 
hotel, convention center, or stadium. For an entity to become a public 
accommodation when it is the lessee of space, however, the Department 
believes that consideration in some form must be given. Thus, a Boy 
Scout troop that accepts donated space does not become a public 
accommodation because the troop has not ``leased'' space, as required by 
the ADA.
    As a public accommodation, the trade association or performing 
artist will be responsible for compliance with this part. Specific 
responsibilities should be allocated by contract, but, generally, the 
lessee should be responsible for providing auxiliary aids and services 
(which could include interpreters, Braille programs, etc.) for the 
participants in its conference or performance as well as for assuring 
that displays are accessible to individuals with disabilities.
    Some commenters suggested that the rule should allocate 
responsibilities for areas other than removal of barriers and auxiliary 
aids. The final rule leaves allocation of all areas to the lease 
negotiations. However, in general landlords should not be given 
responsibility for policies a tenant applies in operating its business, 
if such policies are solely those of the tenant. Thus, if a restaurant 
tenant discriminates by refusing to seat a patron, it would be the 
tenant, and not the landlord, who would be responsible, because the 
discriminatory policy is imposed solely by the tenant and not by the 
landlord. If, however, a tenant refuses to modify a ``no

[[Page 701]]

pets'' rule to allow service animals in its restaurant because the 
landlord mandates such a rule, then both the landlord and the tenant 
would be liable for violation of the ADA when a person with a service 
dog is refused entrance. The Department wishes to emphasize, however, 
that the parties are free to allocate responsibilities in any way they 
choose.
    Private clubs are also exempt from the ADA. However, consistent with 
title II of the Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. 2000a(e), a private club is 
considered a public accommodation to the extent that ``the facilities of 
such establishment are made available to the customers or patrons'' of a 
place of public accommodation. Thus, if a private club runs a day care 
center that is open exclusively to its own members, the club, like the 
church in the example above, would have no responsibility for compliance 
with the ADA. Nor would the day care center have any responsibilities 
because it is part of the private club exempt from the ADA.
    On the other hand, if the private club rents to a day care center 
that is open to the public, then the private club would have the same 
obligations as any other public accommodation that functions as a 
landlord with respect to compliance with title III within the day care 
center. In such a situation, both the private club that ``leases to'' a 
public accommodation and the public accommodation lessee (the day care 
center) would be subject to the ADA. This same principle would apply if 
the private club were to rent to, for example, a bar association, which 
is not generally a public accommodation but which, as explained above, 
becomes a public accommodation when it leases space for a conference.

                        Section 36.202 Activities

    Section 36.202 sets out the general forms of discrimination 
prohibited by title III of the ADA. These general prohibitions are 
further refined by the specific prohibitions in subpart C. Section 
36.213 makes clear that the limitations on the ADA's requirements 
contained in subpart C, such as ``necessity'' (Sec. 36.301(a)) and 
``safety'' (Sec. 36.301(b)), are applicable to the prohibitions in 
Sec. 36.202. Thus, it is unnecessary to add these limitations to Sec. 
36.202 as has been requested by some commenters. In addition, the 
language of Sec. 36.202 very closely tracks the language of section 
302(b)(1)(A) of the Act, and that statutory provision does not expressly 
contain these limitations.
    Deny participation--Section 36.202(a) provides that it is 
discriminatory to deny a person with a disability the right to 
participate in or benefit from the goods, services, facilities, 
privileges, advantages, or accommodations of a place of public 
accommodation.
    A public accommodation may not exclude persons with disabilities on 
the basis of disability for reasons other than those specifically set 
forth in this part. For example, a public accommodation cannot refuse to 
serve a person with a disability because its insurance company 
conditions coverage or rates on the absence of persons with 
disabilities. This is a frequent basis of exclusion from a variety of 
community activities and is prohibited by this part.
    Unequal benefit--Section 36.202(b) prohibits services or 
accommodations that are not equal to those provided others. For example, 
persons with disabilities must not be limited to certain performances at 
a theater.
    Separate benefit--Section 36.202(c) permits different or separate 
benefits or services only when necessary to provide persons with 
disabilities opportunities as effective as those provided others. This 
paragraph permitting separate benefits ``when necessary'' should be read 
together with Sec. 36.203(a), which requires integration in ``the most 
integrated setting appropriate to the needs of the individual.'' The 
preamble to that section provides further guidance on separate programs. 
Thus, this section would not prohibit the designation of parking spaces 
for persons with disabilities.
    Each of the three paragraphs (a)-(c) prohibits discrimination 
against an individual or class of individuals ``either directly or 
through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements.'' The intent of 
the contractual prohibitions of these paragraphs is to prohibit a public 
accommodation from doing indirectly, through a contractual relationship, 
what it may not do directly. Thus, the ``individual or class of 
individuals'' referenced in the three paragraphs is intended to refer to 
the clients and customers of the public accommodation that entered into 
a contractual arrangement. It is not intended to encompass the clients 
or customers of other entities. A public accommodation, therefore, is 
not liable under this provision for discrimination that may be practiced 
by those with whom it has a contractual relationship, when that 
discrimination is not directed against its own clients or customers. For 
example, if an amusement park contracts with a food service company to 
operate its restaurants at the park, the amusement park is not 
responsible for other operations of the food service company that do not 
involve clients or customers of the amusement park. Section 36.202(d) 
makes this clear by providing that the term ``individual or class of 
individuals'' refers to the clients or customers of the public 
accommodation that enters into the contractual, licensing, or other 
arrangement.

                   Section 36.203 Integrated Settings

    Section 36.203 addresses the integration of persons with 
disabilities. The ADA recognizes that the provision of goods and 
services in an integrated manner is a fundamental tenet of 
nondiscrimination on the basis of

[[Page 702]]

disability. Providing segregated accommodations and services relegates 
persons with disabilities to the status of second-class citizens. For 
example, it would be a violation of this provision to require persons 
with mental disabilities to eat in the back room of a restaurant or to 
refuse to allow a person with a disability the full use of a health spa 
because of stereotypes about the person's ability to participate. 
Section 36.203(a) states that a public accommodation shall afford goods, 
services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations to an 
individual with a disability in the most integrated setting appropriate 
to the needs of the individual. Section 36.203(b) specifies that, 
notwithstanding the existence of separate or different programs or 
activities provided in accordance with this section, an individual with 
a disability shall not be denied the opportunity to participate in such 
programs or activities that are not separate or different. Section 
306.203(c), which is derived from section 501(d) of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act, states that nothing in this part shall be construed to 
require an individual with a disability to accept an accommodation, aid, 
service, opportunity, or benefit that he or she chooses not to accept.
    Taken together, these provisions are intended to prohibit exclusion 
and segregation of individuals with disabilities and the denial of equal 
opportunities enjoyed by others, based on, among other things, 
presumptions, patronizing attitudes, fears, and stereotypes about 
individuals with disabilities. Consistent with these standards, public 
accommodations are required to make decisions based on facts applicable 
to individuals and not on the basis of presumptions as to what a class 
of individuals with disabilities can or cannot do.
    Sections 36.203 (b) and (c) make clear that individuals with 
disabilities cannot be denied the opportunity to participate in programs 
that are not separate or different. This is an important and overarching 
principle of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Separate, special, or 
different programs that are designed to provide a benefit to persons 
with disabilities cannot be used to restrict the participation of 
persons with disabilities in general, integrated activities.
    For example, a person who is blind may wish to decline participating 
in a special museum tour that allows persons to touch sculptures in an 
exhibit and instead tour the exhibit at his or her own pace with the 
museum's recorded tour. It is not the intent of this section to require 
the person who is blind to avail himself or herself of the special tour. 
Modified participation for persons with disabilities must be a choice, 
not a requirement.
    Further, it would not be a violation of this section for an 
establishment to offer recreational programs specially designed for 
children with mobility impairments in those limited circumstances. 
However, it would be a violation of this section if the entity then 
excluded these children from other recreational services made available 
to nondisabled children, or required children with disabilities to 
attend only designated programs.
    Many commenters asked that the Department clarify a public 
accommodation's obligations within the integrated program when it offers 
a separate program, but an individual with a disability chooses not to 
participate in the separate program. It is impossible to make a blanket 
statement as to what level of auxiliary aids or modifications are 
required in the integrated program. Rather, each situation must be 
assessed individually. Assuming the integrated program would be 
appropriate for a particular individual, the extent to which that 
individual must be provided with modifications will depend not only on 
what the individual needs but also on the limitations set forth in 
subpart C. For example, it may constitute an undue burden for a 
particular public accommodation, which provides a full-time interpreter 
in its special guided tour for individuals with hearing impairments, to 
hire an additional interpreter for those individuals who choose to 
attend the integrated program. The Department cannot identify 
categorically the level of assistance or aid required in the integrated 
program.
    The preamble to the proposed rule contained a statement that some 
interpreted as encouraging the continuation of separate schools, 
sheltered workshops, special recreational programs, and other similar 
programs. It is important to emphasize that Sec. 36.202(c) only calls 
for separate programs when such programs are ``necessary'' to provide as 
effective an opportunity to individuals with disabilities as to other 
individuals. Likewise, Sec. 36.203(a) only permits separate programs 
when a more integrated setting would not be ``appropriate.'' Separate 
programs are permitted, then, in only limited circumstances. The 
sentence at issue has been deleted from the preamble because it was too 
broadly stated and had been erroneously interpreted as Departmental 
encouragement of separate programs without qualification.
    The proposed rule's reference in Sec. 36.203(b) to separate 
programs or activities provided in accordance with ``this section'' has 
been changed to ``this subpart'' in recognition of the fact that 
separate programs or activities may, in some limited circumstances, be 
permitted not only by Sec. 36.203(a) but also by Sec. 36.202(c).
    In addition, some commenters suggested that the individual with the 
disability is the only one who can decide whether a setting is 
``appropriate'' and what the ``needs'' are.

[[Page 703]]

Others suggested that only the public accommodation can make these 
determinations. The regulation does not give exclusive responsibility to 
either party. Rather, the determinations are to be made based on an 
objective view, presumably one which would take into account views of 
both parties.
    Some commenters expressed concern that Sec. 36.203(c), which states 
that nothing in the rule requires an individual with a disability to 
accept special accommodations and services provided under the ADA, could 
be interpreted to allow guardians of infants or older people with 
disabilities to refuse medical treatment for their wards. Section 
36.203(c) has been revised to make it clear that paragraph (c) is 
inapplicable to the concern of the commenters. A new paragraph (c)(2) 
has been added stating that nothing in the regulation authorizes the 
representative or guardian of an individual with a disability to decline 
food, water, medical treatment, or medical services for that individual. 
New paragraph (c) clarifies that neither the ADA nor the regulation 
alters current Federal law ensuring the rights of incompetent 
individuals with disabilities to receive food, water, and medical 
treatment. See, e.g., Child Abuse Amendments of 1984 (42 U.S.C. 
5106a(b)(10), 5106g(10)); Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 
U.S.C 794); Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act 
(42 U.S.C. 6042).
    Sections 36.203(c) (1) and (2) are based on section 501(d) of the 
ADA. Section Sec. 501(d) was designed to clarify that nothing in the 
ADA requires individuals with disabilities to accept special 
accommodations and services for individuals with disabilities that may 
segregate them:
    The Committee added this section (501(d)) to clarify that nothing in 
the ADA is intended to permit discriminatory treatment on the basis of 
disability, even when such treatment is rendered under the guise of 
providing an accommodation, service, aid or benefit to the individual 
with disability. For example, a blind individual may choose not to avail 
himself or herself of the right to go to the front of a line, even if a 
particular public accommodation has chosen to offer such a modification 
of a policy for blind individuals. Or, a blind individual may choose to 
decline to participate in a special museum tour that allows persons to 
touch sculptures in an exhibit and instead tour the exhibits at his or 
her own pace with the museum's recorded tour.

(Judiciary report at 71-72.) The Act is not to be construed to mean that 
an individual with disabilities must accept special accommodations and 
services for individuals with disabilities when that individual chooses 
to participate in the regular services already offered. Because medical 
treatment, including treatment for particular conditions, is not a 
special accommodation or service for individuals with disabilities under 
section 501(d), neither the Act nor this part provides affirmative 
authority to suspend such treatment. Section 501(d) is intended to 
clarify that the Act is not designed to foster discrimination through 
mandatory acceptance of special services when other alternatives are 
provided; this concern does not reach to the provision of medical 
treatment for the disabling condition itself.
    Section 36.213 makes clear that the limitations contained in subpart 
C are to be read into subpart B. Thus, the integration requirement is 
subject to the various defenses contained in subpart C, such as safety, 
if eligibility criteria are at issue (Sec. 36.301(b)), or fundamental 
alteration and undue burden, if the concern is provision of auxiliary 
aids (Sec. 36.303(a)).

                  Section 36.204 Administrative Methods

    Section 36.204 specifies that an individual or entity shall not, 
directly, or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize 
standards or criteria or methods of administration that have the effect 
of discriminating on the basis of disability or that perpetuate the 
discrimination of others who are subject to common administrative 
control. The preamble discussion of Sec. 36.301 addresses eligibility 
criteria in detail.
    Section 36.204 is derived from section 302(b)(1)(D) of the Americans 
with Disabilities Act, and it uses the same language used in the 
employment section of the ADA (section 102(b)(3)). Both sections 
incorporate a disparate impact standard to ensure the effectiveness of 
the legislative mandate to end discrimination. This standard is 
consistent with the interpretation of section 504 by the U.S. Supreme 
Court in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985). The Court in Choate 
explained that members of Congress made numerous statements during 
passage of section 504 regarding eliminating architectural barriers, 
providing access to transportation, and eliminating discriminatory 
effects of job qualification procedures. The Court then noted: ``These 
statements would ring hollow if the resulting legislation could not 
rectify the harms resulting from action that discriminated by effect as 
well as by design.'' Id at 297 (footnote omitted).
    Of course, Sec. 36.204 is subject to the various limitations 
contained in subpart C including, for example, necessity (Sec. 
36.301(a)), safety (Sec. 36.301(b)), fundamental alteration (Sec. 
36.302(a)), readily achievable (Sec. 36.304(a)), and undue burden 
(Sec. 36.303(a)).

                       Section 36.205 Association

    Section 36.205 implements section 302(b)(1)(E) of the Act, which 
provides that a public accommodation shall not exclude or

[[Page 704]]

otherwise deny equal goods, services, facilities, privileges, 
advantages, accommodations, or other opportunities to an individual or 
entity because of the known disability of an individual with whom the 
individual or entity is known to have a relationship or association. 
This section is unchanged from the proposed rule.
    The individuals covered under this section include any individuals 
who are discriminated against because of their known association with an 
individual with a disability. For example, it would be a violation of 
this part for a day care center to refuse admission to a child because 
his or her brother has HIV disease.
    This protection is not limited to those who have a familial 
relationship with the individual who has a disability. If a place of 
public accommodation refuses admission to a person with cerebral palsy 
and his or her companions, the companions have an independent right of 
action under the ADA and this section.
    During the legislative process, the term ``entity'' was added to 
section 302(b)(1)(E) to clarify that the scope of the provision is 
intended to encompass not only persons who have a known association with 
a person with a disability, but also entities that provide services to 
or are otherwise associated with such individuals. This provision was 
intended to ensure that entities such as health care providers, 
employees of social service agencies, and others who provide 
professional services to persons with disabilities are not subjected to 
discrimination because of their professional association with persons 
with disabilities. For example, it would be a violation of this section 
to terminate the lease of an entity operating an independent living 
center for persons with disabilities, or to seek to evict a health care 
provider because that individual or entity provides services to persons 
with mental impairments.

                 Section 36.206 Retaliation or Coercion

    Section 36.206 implements section 503 of the ADA, which prohibits 
retaliation against any individual who exercises his or her rights under 
the Act. This section is unchanged from the proposed rule. Paragraph (a) 
of Sec. 36.206 provides that no private entity or public entity shall 
discriminate against any individual because that individual has 
exercised his or her right to oppose any act or practice made unlawful 
by this part, or because that individual made a charge, testified, 
assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, 
or hearing under the Act or this part.
    Paragraph (b) provides that no private entity or public entity shall 
coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with any individual in the 
exercise of his or her rights under this part or because that individual 
aided or encouraged any other individual in the exercise or enjoyment of 
any right granted or protected by the Act or this part.
    Illustrations of practices prohibited by this section are contained 
in paragraph (c), which is modeled on a similar provision in the 
regulations issued by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to 
implement the Fair Housing Act (see 24 CFR 100.400(c)(l)). Prohibited 
actions may include:
    (1) Coercing an individual to deny or limit the benefits, services, 
or advantages to which he or she is entitled under the Act or this part;
    (2) Threatening, intimidating, or interfering with an individual who 
is seeking to obtain or use the goods, services, facilities, privileges, 
advantages, or accommodations of a public accommodation;
    (3) Intimidating or threatening any person because that person is 
assisting or encouraging an individual or group entitled to claim the 
rights granted or protected by the Act or this part to exercise those 
rights; or
    (4) Retaliating against any person because that person has 
participated in any investigation or action to enforce the Act or this 
part.
    This section protects not only individuals who allege a violation of 
the Act or this part, but also any individuals who support or assist 
them. This section applies to all investigations or proceedings 
initiated under the Act or this part without regard to the ultimate 
resolution of the underlying allegations. Because this section prohibits 
any act of retaliation or coercion in response to an individual's effort 
to exercise rights established by the Act and this part (or to support 
the efforts of another individual), the section applies not only to 
public accommodations that are otherwise subject to this part, but also 
to individuals other than public accommodations or to public entities. 
For example, it would be a violation of the Act and this part for a 
private individual, e.g., a restaurant customer, to harass or intimidate 
an individual with a disability in an effort to prevent that individual 
from patronizing the restaurant. It would, likewise, be a violation of 
the Act and this part for a public entity to take adverse action against 
an employee who appeared as a witness on behalf of an individual who 
sought to enforce the Act.

    Section 36.207 Places of Public Accommodation Located in Private 
                               Residences

    A private home used exclusively as a residence is not covered by 
title III because it is neither a ``commercial facility'' nor a ``place 
of public accommodation.'' In some situations, however, a private home 
is not used exclusively as a residence, but houses a place of public 
accommodation in all or part of a home (e.g., an accountant who meets 
with his or her clients at his or her residence). Section 36.207(a) 
provides that those portions of the private residence used in the 
operation

[[Page 705]]

of the place of public accommodation are covered by this part.
    For instance, a home or a portion of a home may be used as a day 
care center during the day and a residence at night. If all parts of the 
house are used for the day care center, then the entire residence is a 
place of public accommodation because no part of the house is used 
exclusively as a residence. If an accountant uses one room in the house 
solely as his or her professional office, then a portion of the house is 
used exclusively as a place of public accommodation and a portion is 
used exclusively as a residence. Section 36.207 provides that when a 
portion of a residence is used exclusively as a residence, that portion 
is not covered by this part. Thus, the portions of the accountant's 
house, other than the professional office and areas and spaces leading 
to it, are not covered by this part. All of the requirements of this 
rule apply to the covered portions, including requirements to make 
reasonable modifications in policies, eliminate discriminatory 
eligibility criteria, take readily achievable measures to remove 
barriers or provide readily achievable alternatives (e.g., making house 
calls), provide auxiliary aids and services and undertake only 
accessible new construction and alterations.
    Paragraph (b) was added in response to comments that sought 
clarification on the extent of coverage of the private residence used as 
the place of public accommodation. The final rule makes clear that the 
place of accommodation extends to all areas of the home used by clients 
and customers of the place of public accommodation. Thus, the ADA would 
apply to any door or entry way, hallways, a restroom, if used by 
customers and clients; and any other portion of the residence, interior 
or exterior, used by customers or clients of the public accommodation. 
This interpretation is simply an application of the general rule for all 
public accommodations, which extends statutory requirements to all 
portions of the facility used by customers and clients, including, if 
applicable, restrooms, hallways, and approaches to the public 
accommodation. As with other public accommodations, barriers at the 
entrance and on the sidewalk leading up to the public accommodation, if 
the sidewalk is under the control of the public accommodation, must be 
removed if doing so is readily achievable.
    The Department recognizes that many businesses that operate out of 
personal residences are quite small, often employing only the homeowner 
and having limited total revenues. In these circumstances the effect of 
ADA coverage would likely be quite minimal. For example, because the 
obligation to remove existing architectural barriers is limited to those 
that are easily accomplishable without much difficulty or expense (see 
Sec. 36.304), the range of required actions would be quite modest. It 
might not be readily achievable for such a place of public accommodation 
to remove any existing barriers. If it is not readily achievable to 
remove existing architectural barriers, a public accommodation located 
in a private residence may meet its obligations under the Act and this 
part by providing its goods or services to clients or customers with 
disabilities through the use of alternative measures, including delivery 
of goods or services in the home of the customer or client, to the 
extent that such alternative measures are readily achievable (See Sec. 
36.305).
    Some commenters asked for clarification as to how the new 
construction and alteration standards of subpart D will apply to 
residences. The new construction standards only apply to the extent that 
the residence or portion of the residence was designed or intended for 
use as a public accommodation. Thus, for example, if a portion of a home 
is designed or constructed for use exclusively as a lawyer's office or 
for use both as a lawyer's office and for residential purposes, then it 
must be designed in accordance with the new construction standards in 
the appendix. Likewise, if a homeowner is undertaking alterations to 
convert all or part of his residence to a place of public accommodation, 
that work must be done in compliance with the alterations standards in 
the appendix.
    The preamble to the proposed rule addressed the applicable 
requirements when a commercial facility is located in a private 
residence. That situation is now addressed in Sec. 36.401(b) of subpart 
D.

                      Section 36.208 Direct Threat

    Section 36.208(a) implements section 302(b)(3) of the Act by 
providing that this part does not require a public accommodation to 
permit an individual to participate in or benefit from the goods, 
services, facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations of the 
public accommodation, if that individual poses a direct threat to the 
health or safety of others. This section is unchanged from the proposed 
rule.
    The Department received a significant number of comments on this 
section. Commenters representing individuals with disabilities generally 
supported this provision, but suggested revisions to further limit its 
application. Commenters representing public accommodations generally 
endorsed modifications that would permit a public accommodation to 
exercise its own judgment in determining whether an individual poses a 
direct threat.
    The inclusion of this provision is not intended to imply that 
persons with disabilities pose risks to others. It is intended to 
address concerns that may arise in this area. It establishes a strict 
standard that must be met before denying service to an individual

[[Page 706]]

with a disability or excluding that individual from participation.
    Paragraph (b) of this section explains that a ``direct threat'' is a 
significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be 
eliminated by a modification of policies, practices, or procedures, or 
by the provision of auxiliary aids and services. This paragraph codifies 
the standard first applied by the Supreme Court in School Board of 
Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273 (1987), in which the Court held 
that an individual with a contagious disease may be an ``individual with 
handicaps'' under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. In Arline, the 
Supreme Court recognized that there is a need to balance the interests 
of people with disabilities against legitimate concerns for public 
safety. Although persons with disabilities are generally entitled to the 
protection of this part, a person who poses a significant risk to others 
may be excluded if reasonable modifications to the public 
accommodation's policies, practices, or procedures will not eliminate 
that risk. The determination that a person poses a direct threat to the 
health or safety of others may not be based on generalizations or 
stereotypes about the effects of a particular disability; it must be 
based on an individual assessment that conforms to the requirements of 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    Paragraph (c) establishes the test to use in determining whether an 
individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others. A 
public accommodation is required to make an individualized assessment, 
based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical evidence or 
on the best available objective evidence, to determine: The nature, 
duration, and severity of the risk; the probability that the potential 
injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable modifications of 
policies, practices, or procedures will mitigate the risk. This is the 
test established by the Supreme Court in Arline. Such an inquiry is 
essential if the law is to achieve its goal of protecting disabled 
individuals from discrimination based on prejudice, stereotypes, or 
unfounded fear, while giving appropriate weight to legitimate concerns, 
such as the need to avoid exposing others to significant health and 
safety risks. Making this assessment will not usually require the 
services of a physician. Sources for medical knowledge include guidance 
from public health authorities, such as the U.S. Public Health Service, 
the Centers for Disease Control, and the National Institutes of Health, 
including the National Institute of Mental Health.
    Many of the commenters sought clarification of the inquiry 
requirement. Some suggested that public accommodations should be 
prohibited from making any inquiries to determine if an individual with 
a disability would pose a direct threat to other persons. The Department 
believes that to preclude all such inquiries would be inappropriate. 
Under Sec. 36.301 of this part, a public accommodation is permitted to 
establish eligibility criteria necessary for the safe operation of the 
place of public accommodation. Implicit in that right is the right to 
ask if an individual meets the criteria. However, any eligibility or 
safety standard established by a public accommodation must be based on 
actual risk, not on speculation or stereotypes; it must be applied to 
all clients or customers of the place of public accommodation; and 
inquiries must be limited to matters necessary to the application of the 
standard.
    Some commenters suggested that the test established in the Arline 
decision, which was developed in the context of an employment case, is 
too stringent to apply in a public accommodations context where 
interaction between the public accommodation and its client or customer 
is often very brief. One suggested alternative was to permit public 
accommodations to exercise ``good faith'' judgment in determining 
whether an individual poses a direct threat, particularly when a public 
accommodation is dealing with a client or customer engaged in disorderly 
or disruptive behavior.
    The Department believes that the ADA clearly requires that any 
determination to exclude an individual from participation must be based 
on an objective standard. A public accommodation may establish neutral 
eligibility criteria as a condition of receiving its goods or services. 
As long as these criteria are necessary for the safe provision of the 
public accommodation's goods and services and applied neutrally to all 
clients or customers, regardless of whether they are individuals with 
disabilities, a person who is unable to meet the criteria may be 
excluded from participation without inquiry into the underlying reason 
for the inability to comply. In places of public accommodation such as 
restaurants, theaters, or hotels, where the contact between the public 
accommodation and its clients is transitory, the uniform application of 
an eligibility standard precluding violent or disruptive behavior by any 
client or customer should be sufficient to enable a public accommodation 
to conduct its business in an orderly manner.
    Some other commenters asked for clarification of the application of 
this provision to persons, particularly children, who have short-term, 
contagious illnesses, such as fevers, influenza, or the common cold. It 
is common practice in schools and day care settings to exclude persons 
with such illnesses until the symptoms subside. The Department believes 
that these commenters misunderstand the scope of this rule. The ADA only 
prohibits discrimination against an individual with a disability. Under 
the ADA and

[[Page 707]]

this part, a ``disability'' is defined as a physical or mental 
impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. 
Common, short-term illnesses that predictably resolve themselves within 
a matter of days do not ``substantially limit'' a major life activity; 
therefore, it is not a violation of this part to exclude an individual 
from receiving the services of a public accommodation because of such 
transitory illness. However, this part does apply to persons who have 
long-term illnesses. Any determination with respect to a person who has 
a chronic or long-term illness must be made in compliance with the 
requirements of this section.

                   Section 36.209 Illegal Use of Drugs

    Section 36.209 effectuates section 510 of the ADA, which clarifies 
the Act's application to people who use drugs illegally. Paragraph (a) 
provides that this part does not prohibit discrimination based on an 
individual's current illegal use of drugs.
    The Act and the regulation distinguish between illegal use of drugs 
and the legal use of substances, whether or not those substances are 
``controlled substances,'' as defined in the Controlled Substances Act 
(21 U.S.C. 812). Some controlled substances are prescription drugs that 
have legitimate medical uses. Section 36.209 does not affect use of 
controlled substances pursuant to a valid prescription, under 
supervision by a licensed health care professional, or other use that is 
authorized by the Controlled Substances Act or any other provision of 
Federal law. It does apply to illegal use of those substances, as well 
as to illegal use of controlled substances that are not prescription 
drugs. The key question is whether the individual's use of the substance 
is illegal, not whether the substance has recognized legal uses. Alcohol 
is not a controlled substance, so use of alcohol is not addressed by 
Sec. 36.209. Alcoholics are individuals with disabilities, subject to 
the protections of the statute.
    A distinction is also made between the use of a substance and the 
status of being addicted to that substance. Addiction is a disability, 
and addicts are individuals with disabilities protected by the Act. The 
protection, however, does not extend to actions based on the illegal use 
of the substance. In other words, an addict cannot use the fact of his 
or her addiction as a defense to an action based on illegal use of 
drugs. This distinction is not artificial. Congress intended to deny 
protection to people who engage in the illegal use of drugs, whether or 
not they are addicted, but to provide protection to addicts so long as 
they are not currently using drugs.
    A third distinction is the difficult one between current use and 
former use. The definition of ``current illegal use of drugs'' in Sec. 
36.104, which is based on the report of the Conference Committee, H.R. 
Conf. Rep. No. 596, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 64 (1990), is ``illegal use of 
drugs that occurred recently enough to justify a reasonable belief that 
a person's drug use is current or that continuing use is a real and 
ongoing problem.''
    Paragraph (a)(2)(i) specifies that an individual who has 
successfully completed a supervised drug rehabilitation program or has 
otherwise been rehabilitated successfully and who is not engaging in 
current illegal use of drugs is protected. Paragraph (a)(2)(ii) 
clarifies that an individual who is currently participating in a 
supervised rehabilitation program and is not engaging in current illegal 
use of drugs is protected. Paragraph (a)(2)(iii) provides that a person 
who is erroneously regarded as engaging in current illegal use of drugs, 
but who is not engaging in such use, is protected.
    Paragraph (b) provides a limited exception to the exclusion of 
current illegal users of drugs from the protections of the Act. It 
prohibits denial of health services, or services provided in connection 
with drug rehabilitation, to an individual on the basis of current 
illegal use of drugs, if the individual is otherwise entitled to such 
services. As explained further in the discussion of Sec. 36.302, a 
health care facility that specializes in a particular type of treatment, 
such as care of burn victims, is not required to provide drug 
rehabilitation services, but it cannot refuse to treat an individual's 
burns on the grounds that the individual is illegally using drugs.
    A commenter argued that health care providers should be permitted to 
use their medical judgment to postpone discretionary medical treatment 
of individuals under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The regulation 
permits a medical practitioner to take into account an individual's use 
of drugs in determining appropriate medical treatment. Section 36.209 
provides that the prohibitions on discrimination in this part do not 
apply when the public accommodation acts on the basis of current illegal 
use of drugs. Although those prohibitions do apply under paragraph (b), 
the limitations established under this part also apply. Thus, under 
Sec. 36.208, a health care provider or other public accommodation 
covered under Sec. 36.209(b) may exclude an individual whose current 
illegal use of drugs poses a direct threat to the health or safety of 
others, and, under Sec. 36.301, a public accommodation may impose or 
apply eligibility criteria that are necessary for the provision of the 
services being offered, and may impose legitimate safety requirements 
that are necessary for safe operation. These same limitations also apply 
to individuals with disabilities who use alcohol or prescription drugs. 
The Department believes that these provisions address this commenter's 
concerns.
    Other commenters pointed out that abstention from the use of drugs 
is an essential

[[Page 708]]

condition for participation in some drug rehabilitation programs, and 
may be a necessary requirement in inpatient or residential settings. The 
Department believes that this comment is well-founded. Congress clearly 
did not intend to exclude from drug treatment programs the very 
individuals who need such programs because of their use of drugs. In 
such a situation, however, once an individual has been admitted to a 
program, abstention may be a necessary and appropriate condition to 
continued participation. The final rule therefore provides that a drug 
rehabilitation or treatment program may deny participation to 
individuals who use drugs while they are in the program.
    Paragraph (c) expresses Congress' intention that the Act be neutral 
with respect to testing for illegal use of drugs. This paragraph 
implements the provision in section 510(b) of the Act that allows 
entities ``to adopt or administer reasonable policies or procedures, 
including but not limited to drug testing,'' that ensure an individual 
who is participating in a supervised rehabilitation program, or who has 
completed such a program or otherwise been rehabilitated successfully, 
is no longer engaging in the illegal use of drugs. Paragraph (c) is not 
to be construed to encourage, prohibit, restrict, or authorize the 
conducting of testing for the illegal use of drugs.
    Paragraph (c) of Sec. 36.209 clarifies that it is not a violation 
of this part to adopt or administer reasonable policies or procedures to 
ensure that an individual who formerly engaged in the illegal use of 
drugs is not currently engaging in illegal use of drugs. Any such 
policies or procedures must, of course, be reasonable, and must be 
designed to identify accurately the illegal use of drugs. This paragraph 
does not authorize inquiries, tests, or other procedures that would 
disclose use of substances that are not controlled substances or are 
taken under supervision by a licensed health care professional, or other 
uses authorized by the Controlled Substances Act or other provisions of 
Federal law, because such uses are not included in the definition of 
``illegal use of drugs.''
    One commenter argued that the rule should permit testing for lawful 
use of prescription drugs, but most favored the explanation that tests 
must be limited to unlawful use in order to avoid revealing the use of 
prescription medicine used to treat disabilities. Tests revealing legal 
use of prescription drugs might violate the prohibition in Sec. 36.301 
of attempts to unnecessarily identify the existence of a disability.

                         Section 36.210 Smoking

    Section 36.210 restates the clarification in section 501(b) of the 
Act that the Act does not preclude the prohibition of, or imposition of 
restrictions on, smoking. Some commenters argued that Sec. 36.210 does 
not go far enough, and that the regulation should prohibit smoking in 
all places of public accommodation. The reference to smoking in section 
501 merely clarifies that the Act does not require public accommodations 
to accommodate smokers by permitting them to smoke in places of public 
accommodations.

            Section 36.211 Maintenance of Accessible Features

    Section 36.211 provides that a public accommodation shall maintain 
in operable working condition those features of facilities and equipment 
that are required to be readily accessible to and usable by persons with 
disabilities by the Act or this part. The Act requires that, to the 
maximum extent feasible, facilities must be accessible to, and usable 
by, individuals with disabilities. This section recognizes that it is 
not sufficient to provide features such as accessible routes, elevators, 
or ramps, if those features are not maintained in a manner that enables 
individuals with disabilities to use them. Inoperable elevators, locked 
accessible doors, or ``accessible'' routes that are obstructed by 
furniture, filing cabinets, or potted plants are neither ``accessible 
to'' nor ``usable by'' individuals with disabilities.
    Some commenters objected that this section appeared to establish an 
absolute requirement and suggested that language from the preamble be 
included in the text of the regulation. It is, of course, impossible to 
guarantee that mechanical devices will never fail to operate. Paragraph 
(b) of the final regulation provides that this section does not prohibit 
isolated or temporary interruptions in service or access due to 
maintenance or repairs. This paragraph is intended to clarify that 
temporary obstructions or isolated instances of mechanical failure would 
not be considered violations of the Act or this part. However, allowing 
obstructions or ``out of service'' equipment to persist beyond a 
reasonable period of time would violate this part, as would repeated 
mechanical failures due to improper or inadequate maintenance. Failure 
of the public accommodation to ensure that accessible routes are 
properly maintained and free of obstructions, or failure to arrange 
prompt repair of inoperable elevators or other equipment intended to 
provide access, would also violate this part.
    Other commenters requested that this section be expanded to include 
specific requirements for inspection and maintenance of equipment, for 
training staff in the proper operation of equipment, and for maintenance 
of specific items. The Department believes that this section properly 
establishes the general requirement for maintaining access and that 
further, more detailed requirements are not necessary.

[[Page 709]]

                        Section 36.212 Insurance

    The Department received numerous comments on proposed Sec. 36.212. 
Most supported the proposed regulation but felt that it did not go far 
enough in protecting individuals with disabilities and persons 
associated with them from discrimination. Many commenters argued that 
language from the preamble to the proposed regulation should be included 
in the text of the final regulation. Other commenters argued that even 
that language was not strong enough, and that more stringent standards 
should be established. Only a few commenters argued that the Act does 
not apply to insurance underwriting practices or the terms of insurance 
contracts. These commenters cited language from the Senate committee 
report (S. Rep. No. 116, 101st Cong., 1st Sess., at 84-86 (1989) 
(hereinafter ``Senate report'')), indicating that Congress did not 
intend to affect existing insurance practices.
    The Department has decided to adopt the language of the proposed 
rule without change. Sections 36.212 (a) and (b) restate section 501(c) 
of the Act, which provides that the Act shall not be construed to 
restrict certain insurance practices on the part of insurance companies 
and employers, as long as such practices are not used to evade the 
purposes of the Act. Section 36.212(c) is a specific application of 
Sec. 36.202(a), which prohibits denial of participation on the basis of 
disability. It provides that a public accommodation may not refuse to 
serve an individual with a disability because of limitations on coverage 
or rates in its insurance policies (see Judiciary report at 56).
    Many commenters supported the requirements of Sec. 36.212(c) in the 
proposed rule because it addressed an important reason for denial of 
services by public accommodations. One commenter argued that services 
could be denied if the insurance coverage required exclusion of people 
whose disabilities were reasonably related to the risks involved in that 
particular place of public accommodation. Sections 36.208 and 36.301 
establish criteria for denial of participation on the basis of 
legitimate safety concerns. This paragraph does not prohibit 
consideration of such concerns in insurance policies, but provides that 
any exclusion on the basis of disability must be based on the 
permissible criteria, rather than on the terms of the insurance 
contract.
    Language in the committee reports indicates that Congress intended 
to reach insurance practices by prohibiting differential treatment of 
individuals with disabilities in insurance offered by public 
accommodations unless the differences are justified. ``Under the ADA, a 
person with a disability cannot be denied insurance or be subject to 
different terms or conditions of insurance based on disability alone, if 
the disability does not pose increased risks'' (Senate report at 84; 
Education and Labor report at 136). Section 501(c) (1) of the Act was 
intended to emphasize that ``insurers may continue to sell to and 
underwrite individuals applying for life, health, or other insurance on 
an individually underwritten basis, or to service such insurance 
products, so long as the standards used are based on sound actuarial 
data and not on speculation'' (Judiciary report at 70 (emphasis added); 
see also Senate report at 85; Education and Labor report at 137).
    The committee reports indicate that underwriting and classification 
of risks must be ``based on sound actuarial principles or be related to 
actual or reasonably anticipated experience'' (see, e.g., Judiciary 
report at 71). Moreover, ``while a plan which limits certain kinds of 
coverage based on classification of risk would be allowed * * *, the 
plan may not refuse to insure, or refuse to continue to insure, or limit 
the amount, extent, or kind of coverage available to an individual, or 
charge a different rate for the same coverage solely because of a 
physical or mental impairment, except where the refusal, limitation, or 
rate differential is based on sound actuarial principles or is related 
to actual or reasonably anticipated experience'' (Senate report at 85; 
Education and Labor report at 136-37; Judiciary report at 71). The ADA, 
therefore, does not prohibit use of legitimate actuarial considerations 
to justify differential treatment of individuals with disabilities in 
insurance.
    The committee reports provide some guidance on how nondiscrimination 
principles in the disability rights area relate to insurance practices. 
For example, a person who is blind may not be denied coverage based on 
blindness independent of actuarial risk classification. With respect to 
group health insurance coverage, an individual with a pre-existing 
condition may be denied coverage for that condition for the period 
specified in the policy, but cannot be denied coverage for illness or 
injuries unrelated to the pre-existing condition. Also, a public 
accommodation may offer insurance policies that limit coverage for 
certain procedures or treatments, but may not entirely deny coverage to 
a person with a disability.
    The Department requested comment on the extent to which data that 
would establish statistically sound correlations are available. Numerous 
commenters cited pervasive problems in the availability and cost of 
insurance for individuals with disabilities and parents of children with 
disabilities. No commenters cited specific data, or sources of data, to 
support specific exclusionary practices. Several commenters reported 
that, even when statistics are available, they are often outdated and do 
not reflect current medical technology and treatment methods. Concern 
was expressed that adequate efforts are not made to distinguish those 
individuals

[[Page 710]]

who are high users of health care from individuals in the same 
diagnostic groups who may be low users of health care. One insurer 
reported that ``hard data and actuarial statistics are not available to 
provide precise numerical justifications for every underwriting 
determination,'' but argued that decisions may be based on ``logical 
principles generally accepted by actuarial science and fully consistent 
with state insurance laws.'' The commenter urged that the Department 
recognize the validity of information other than statistical data as a 
basis for insurance determinations.
    The most frequent comment was a recommendation that the final 
regulation should require the insurance company to provide a copy of the 
actuarial data on which its actions are based when requested by the 
applicant. Such a requirement would be beyond anything contemplated by 
the Act or by Congress and has therefore not been included in the 
Department's final rule. Because the legislative history of the ADA 
clarifies that different treatment of individuals with disabilities in 
insurance may be justified by sound actuarial data, such actuarial data 
will be critical to any potential litigation on this issue. This 
information would presumably be obtainable in a court proceeding where 
the insurer's actuarial data was the basis for different treatment of 
persons with disabilities. In addition, under some State regulatory 
schemes, insurers may have to file such actuarial information with the 
State regulatory agency and this information may be obtainable at the 
State level.
    A few commenters representing the insurance industry conceded that 
underwriting practices in life and health insurance are clearly covered, 
but argued that property and casualty insurance are not covered. The 
Department sees no reason for this distinction. Although life and health 
insurance are the areas where the regulation will have its greatest 
application, the Act applies equally to unjustified discrimination in 
all types of insurance provided by public accommodations. A number of 
commenters, for example, reported difficulties in obtaining automobile 
insurance because of their disabilities, despite their having good 
driving records.

      Section 36.213 Relationship of Subpart 8 to Subparts C and D

    This section explains that subpart B sets forth the general 
principles of nondiscrimination applicable to all entities subject to 
this regulation, while subparts C and D provide guidance on the 
application of this part to specific situations. The specific provisions 
in subparts C and D, including the limitations on those provisions, 
control over the general provisions in circumstances where both specific 
and general provisions apply. Resort to the general provisions of 
subpart B is only appropriate where there are no applicable specific 
rules of guidance in subparts C or D. This interaction between the 
specific requirements and the general requirements operates with regard 
to contractual obligations as well.
    One illustration of this principle is its application to the 
obligation of a public accommodation to provide access to services by 
removal of architectural barriers or by alternatives to barrier removal. 
The general requirement, established in subpart B by Sec. 36.203, is 
that a public accommodation must provide its services to individuals 
with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate. This 
general requirement would appear to categorically prohibit 
``segregated'' seating for persons in wheelchairs. Section 36.304, 
however, only requires removal of architectural barriers to the extent 
that removal is ``readily achievable.'' If providing access to all areas 
of a restaurant, for example, would not be ``readily achievable,'' a 
public accommodation may provide access to selected areas only. Also, 
Sec. 36.305 provides that, where barrier removal is not readily 
achievable, a public accommodation may use alternative, readily 
achievable methods of making services available, such as curbside 
service or home delivery. Thus, in this manner, the specific 
requirements of Sec. Sec. 36.304 and 36.305 control over the general 
requirement of Sec. 36.203.

                    Subpart C--Specific Requirements

    In general, subpart C implements the ``specific prohibitions'' that 
comprise section 302(b)(2) of the ADA. It also addresses the 
requirements of section 309 of the ADA regarding examinations and 
courses.

                   Section 36.301 Eligibility Criteria

    Section 36.301 of the rule prohibits the imposition or application 
of eligibility criteria that screen out or tend to screen out an 
individual with a disability or any class of individuals with 
disabilities from fully and equally enjoying any goods, services, 
facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations, unless such 
criteria can be shown to be necessary for the provision of the goods, 
services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations being 
offered. This prohibition is based on section 302(b)(2)(A)(i) of the 
ADA.
    It would violate this section to establish exclusive or segregative 
eligibility criteria that would bar, for example, all persons who are 
deaf from playing on a golf course or all individuals with cerebral 
palsy from attending a movie theater, or limit the seating of 
individuals with Down's syndrome to only particular areas of a 
restaurant. The wishes, tastes, or preferences of other customers may 
not be asserted to justify criteria that

[[Page 711]]

would exclude or segregate individuals with disabilities.
    Section 36.301 also prohibits attempts by a public accommodation to 
unnecessarily identify the existence of a disability; for example, it 
would be a violation of this section for a retail store to require an 
individual to state on a credit application whether the applicant has 
epilepsy, mental illness, or any other disability, or to inquire 
unnecessarily whether an individual has HIV disease.
    Section 36.301 also prohibits policies that unnecessarily impose 
requirements or burdens on individuals with disabilities that are not 
placed on others. For example, public accommodations may not require 
that an individual with a disability be accompanied by an attendant. As 
provided by Sec. 36.306, however, a public accommodation is not 
required to provide services of a personal nature including assistance 
in toileting, eating, or dressing.
    Paragraph (c) of Sec. 36.301 provides that public accommodations 
may not place a surcharge on a particular individual with a disability 
or any group of individuals with disabilities to cover the costs of 
measures, such as the provision of auxiliary aids and services, barrier 
removal, alternatives to barrier removal, and reasonable modifications 
in policies, practices, and procedures, that are required to provide 
that individual or group with the nondiscriminatory treatment required 
by the Act or this part.
    A number of commenters inquired as to whether deposits required for 
the use of auxiliary aids, such as assistive listening devices, are 
prohibited surcharges. It is the Department's view that reasonable, 
completely refundable, deposits are not to be considered surcharges 
prohibited by this section. Requiring deposits is an important means of 
ensuring the availability of equipment necessary to ensure compliance 
with the ADA.
    Other commenters sought clarification as to whether Sec. 36.301(c) 
prohibits professionals from charging for the additional time that it 
may take in certain cases to provide services to an individual with 
disabilities. The Department does not intend Sec. 36.301(c) to prohibit 
professionals who bill on the basis of time from charging individuals 
with disabilities on that basis. However, fees may not be charged for 
the provision of auxiliary aids and services, barrier removal, 
alternatives to barrier removal, reasonable modifications in policies, 
practices, and procedures, or any other measures necessary to ensure 
compliance with the ADA.
    Other commenters inquired as to whether day care centers may charge 
for extra services provided to individuals with disabilities. As stated 
above, Sec. 36.302(c) is intended only to prohibit charges for measures 
necessary to achieve compliance with the ADA.
    Another commenter asserted that charges may be assessed for home 
delivery provided as an alternative to barrier removal under Sec. 
36.305, when home delivery is provided to all customers for a fee. 
Charges for home delivery are permissible if home delivery is not 
considered an alternative to barrier removal. If the public 
accommodation offers an alternative, such as curb, carry-out, or 
sidewalk service for which no surcharge is assessed, then it may charge 
for home delivery in accordance with its standard pricing for home 
delivery.
    In addition, Sec. 36.301 prohibits the imposition of criteria that 
``tend to'' screen out an individual with a disability. This concept, 
which is derived from current regulations under section 504 (see, e.g., 
45 CFR 84.13), makes it discriminatory to impose policies or criteria 
that, while not creating a direct bar to individuals with disabilities, 
indirectly prevent or limit their ability to participate. For example, 
requiring presentation of a driver's license as the sole means of 
identification for purposes of paying by check would violate this 
section in situations where, for example, individuals with severe vision 
impairments or developmental disabilities or epilepsy are ineligible to 
receive a driver's license and the use of an alternative means of 
identification, such as another photo I.D. or credit card, is feasible.
    A public accommodation may, however, impose neutral rules and 
criteria that screen out, or tend to screen out, individuals with 
disabilities, if the criteria are necessary for the safe operation of 
the public accommodation. Examples of safety qualifications that would 
be justifiable in appropriate circumstances would include height 
requirements for certain amusement park rides or a requirement that all 
participants in a recreational rafting expedition be able to meet a 
necessary level of swimming proficiency. Safety requirements must be 
based on actual risks and not on speculation, stereotypes, or 
generalizations about individuals with disabilities.

   Section 36.302 Modifications in Policies, Practices, or Procedures

    Section 36.302 of the rule prohibits the failure to make reasonable 
modifications in policies, practices, and procedures when such 
modifications may be necessary to afford any goods, services, 
facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations, unless the entity 
can demonstrate that making such modifications would fundamentally alter 
the nature of such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, 
or accommodations. This prohibition is based on section 302(b)(2)(A)(ii) 
of the ADA.
    For example, a parking facility would be required to modify a rule 
barring all vans or all vans with raised roofs, if an individual who 
uses a wheelchair-accessible van wishes to park in that facility, and if 
overhead structures are high enough to accommodate

[[Page 712]]

the height of the van. A department store may need to modify a policy of 
only permitting one person at a time in a dressing room, if an 
individual with mental retardation needs and requests assistance in 
dressing from a companion. Public accommodations may need to revise 
operational policies to ensure that services are available to 
individuals with disabilities. For instance, a hotel may need to adopt a 
policy of keeping an accessible room unoccupied until an individual with 
a disability arrives at the hotel, assuming the individual has properly 
reserved the room.
    One example of application of this principle is specifically 
included in a new Sec. 36.302(d) on check-out aisles. That paragraph 
provides that a store with check-out aisles must ensure that an adequate 
number of accessible check-out aisles is kept open during store hours, 
or must otherwise modify its policies and practices, in order to ensure 
that an equivalent level of convenient service is provided to 
individuals with disabilities as is provided to others. For example, if 
only one check-out aisle is accessible, and it is generally used for 
express service, one way of providing equivalent service is to allow 
persons with mobility impairments to make all of their purchases at that 
aisle. This principle also applies with respect to other accessible 
elements and services. For example, a particular bank may be in 
compliance with the accessibility guidelines for new construction 
incorporated in appendix A with respect to automated teller machines 
(ATM) at a new branch office by providing one accessible walk-up machine 
at that location, even though an adjacent walk-up ATM is not accessible 
and the drive-up ATM is not accessible. However, the bank would be in 
violation of this section if the accessible ATM was located in a lobby 
that was locked during evening hours while the drive-up ATM was 
available to customers without disabilities during those same hours. The 
bank would need to ensure that the accessible ATM was available to 
customers during the hours that any of the other ATM's was available.
    A number of commenters inquired as to the relationship between this 
section and Sec. 36.307, ``Accessible or special goods.'' Under Sec. 
36.307, a public accommodation is not required to alter its inventory to 
include accessible or special goods that are designed for, or facilitate 
use by, individuals with disabilities. The rule enunciated in Sec. 
36.307 is consistent with the ``fundamental alteration'' defense to the 
reasonable modifications requirement of Sec. 36.302. Therefore, Sec. 
36.302 would not require the inventory of goods provided by a public 
accommodation to be altered to include goods with accessibility 
features. For example, Sec. 36.302 would not require a bookstore to 
stock Brailled books or order Brailled books, if it does not do so in 
the normal course of its business.
    The rule does not require modifications to the legitimate areas of 
specialization of service providers. Section 36.302(b) provides that a 
public accommodation may refer an individual with a disability to 
another public accommodation, if that individual is seeking, or 
requires, treatment or services outside of the referring public 
accommodation's area of specialization, and if, in the normal course of 
its operations, the referring public accommodation would make a similar 
referral for an individual without a disability who seeks or requires 
the same treatment or services.
    For example, it would not be discriminatory for a physician who 
specializes only in burn treatment to refer an individual who is deaf to 
another physician for treatment of an injury other than a burn injury. 
To require a physician to accept patients outside of his or her 
specialty would fundamentally alter the nature of the medical practice 
and, therefore, not be required by this section.
    A clinic specializing exclusively in drug rehabilitation could 
similarly refuse to treat a person who is not a drug addict, but could 
not refuse to treat a person who is a drug addict simply because the 
patient tests positive for HIV. Conversely, a clinic that specializes in 
the treatment of individuals with HIV could refuse to treat an 
individual that does not have HIV, but could not refuse to treat a 
person for HIV infection simply because that person is also a drug 
addict.
    Some commenters requested clarification as to how this provision 
would apply to situations where manifestations of the disability in 
question, itself, would raise complications requiring the expertise of a 
different practitioner. It is not the Department's intention in Sec. 
36.302(b) to prohibit a physician from referring an individual with a 
disability to another physician, if the disability itself creates 
specialized complications for the patient's health that the physician 
lacks the experience or knowledge to address (see Education and Labor 
report at 106).
    Section 36.302(c)(1) requires that a public accommodation modify its 
policies, practices, or procedures to permit the use of a service animal 
by an individual with a disability in any area open to the general 
public. The term ``service animal'' is defined in Sec. 36.104 to 
include guide dogs, signal dogs, or any other animal individually 
trained to provide assistance to an individual with a disability.
    A number of commenters pointed to the difficulty of making the 
distinction required by the proposed rule between areas open to the 
general public and those that are not. The ambiguity and uncertainty 
surrounding these provisions has led the Department to adopt a single 
standard for all public accommodations.

[[Page 713]]

    Section 36.302(c)(1) of the final rule now provides that 
``[g]enerally, a public accommodation shall modify policies, practices, 
and procedures to permit the use of a service animal by an individual 
with a disability.'' This formulation reflects the general intent of 
Congress that public accommodations take the necessary steps to 
accommodate service animals and to ensure that individuals with 
disabilities are not separated from their service animals. It is 
intended that the broadest feasible access be provided to service 
animals in all places of public accommodation, including movie theaters, 
restaurants, hotels, retail stores, hospitals, and nursing homes (see 
Education and Labor report at 106; Judiciary report at 59). The section 
also acknowledges, however, that, in rare circumstances, accommodation 
of service animals may not be required because a fundamental alteration 
would result in the nature of the goods, services, facilities, 
privileges, or accommodations offered or provided, or the safe operation 
of the public accommodation would be jeopardized.
    As specified in Sec. 36.302(c)(2), the rule does not require a 
public accommodation to supervise or care for any service animal. If a 
service animal must be separated from an individual with a disability in 
order to avoid a fundamental alteration or a threat to safety, it is the 
responsibility of the individual with the disability to arrange for the 
care and supervision of the animal during the period of separation.
    A museum would not be required by Sec. 36.302 to modify a policy 
barring the touching of delicate works of art in order to enhance the 
participation of individuals who are blind, if the touching threatened 
the integrity of the work. Damage to a museum piece would clearly be a 
fundamental alteration that is not required by this section.

               Section 36.303 Auxiliary Aids and Services.

    Section 36.303 of the final rule requires a public accommodation to 
take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that no individual with a 
disability is excluded, denied services, segregated or otherwise treated 
differently than other individuals because of the absence of auxiliary 
aids and services, unless the public accommodation can demonstrate that 
taking such steps would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods, 
services, facilities, advantages, or accommodations being offered or 
would result in an undue burden. This requirement is based on section 
302(b)(2)(A)(iii) of the ADA.
    Implicit in this duty to provide auxiliary aids and services is the 
underlying obligation of a public accommodation to communicate 
effectively with its customers, clients, patients, or participants who 
have disabilities affecting hearing, vision, or speech. To give emphasis 
to this underlying obligation, Sec. 36.303(c) of the rule incorporates 
language derived from section 504 regulations for federally conducted 
programs (see e.g., 28 CFR 39.160(a)) that requires that appropriate 
auxiliary aids and services be furnished to ensure that communication 
with persons with disabilities is as effective as communication with 
others.
    Auxiliary aids and services include a wide range of services and 
devices for ensuring effective communication. Use of the most advanced 
technology is not required so long as effective communication is 
ensured. The Department's proposed Sec. 36.303(b) provided a list of 
examples of auxiliary aids and services that was taken from the 
definition of auxiliary aids and services in section 3(1) of the ADA and 
was supplemented by examples from regulations implementing section 504 
in federally conducted programs (see e.g., 28 CFR 39.103). A substantial 
number of commenters suggested that additional examples be added to this 
list. The Department has added several items to this list but wishes to 
clarify that the list is not an all-inclusive or exhaustive catalogue of 
possible or available auxiliary aids or services. It is not possible to 
provide an exhaustive list, and such an attempt would omit new devices 
that will become available with emerging technology.
    The Department has added videotext displays, computer-aided 
transcription services, and open and closed captioning to the list of 
examples. Videotext displays have become an important means of accessing 
auditory communications through a public address system. Transcription 
services are used to relay aurally delivered material almost 
simultaneously in written form to persons who are deaf or hard of 
hearing. This technology is often used at conferences, conventions, and 
hearings. While the proposed rule expressly included television decoder 
equipment as an auxiliary aid or service, it did not mention captioning 
itself. The final rule rectifies this omission by mentioning both closed 
and open captioning.
    In this section, the Department has changed the proposed rule's 
phrase, ``orally delivered materials,'' to the phrase, ``aurally 
delivered materials.'' This new phrase tracks the language in the 
definition of ``auxiliary aids and services'' in section 3 of the ADA 
and is meant to include nonverbal sounds and alarms and computer-
generated speech.
    Several persons and organizations requested that the Department 
replace the term ``telecommunications devices for deaf persons'' or 
``TDD's'' with the term ``text telephone.'' The Department has declined 
to do so. The Department is aware that the Architectural and 
Transportation Barriers Compliance Board has used the phrase ``text 
telephone'' in lieu of the statutory term ``TDD'' in its final 
accessibility guidelines. Title IV of the ADA, however, uses the term 
``Telecommunications Device for the Deaf,''

[[Page 714]]

and the Department believes it would be inappropriate to abandon this 
statutory term at this time.
    Paragraph (b)(2) lists examples of aids and services for making 
visually delivered materials accessible to persons with visual 
impairments. Many commenters proposed additional examples such as 
signage or mapping, audio description services, secondary auditory 
programs (SAP), telebraillers, and reading machines. While the 
Department declines to add these items to the list in the regulation, 
they may be considered appropriate auxiliary aids and services.
    Paragraph (b)(3) refers to the acquisition or modification of 
equipment or devices. For example, tape players used for an audio-guided 
tour of a museum exhibit may require the addition of Brailled adhesive 
labels to the buttons on a reasonable number of the tape players to 
facilitate their use by individuals who are blind. Similarly, permanent 
or portable assistive listening systems for persons with hearing 
impairments may be required at a hotel conference center.
    Several commenters suggested the addition of current technological 
innovations in microelectronics and computerized control systems (e.g., 
voice recognition systems, automatic dialing telephones, and infrared 
elevator and light control systems) to the list of auxiliary aids and 
services. The Department interprets auxiliary aids and services as those 
aids and services designed to provide effective communications, i. e., 
making aurally and visually delivered information available to persons 
with hearing, speech, and vision impairments. Methods of making 
services, programs, or activities accessible to, or usable by, 
individuals with mobility or manual dexterity impairments are addressed 
by other sections of this part, including the requirements for 
modifications in policies, practices, or procedures (Sec. 36.302), the 
elimination of existing architectural barriers (Sec. 36.304), and the 
provision of alternatives to barriers removal (Sec. 36.305).
    Paragraph (b)(4) refers to other similar services and actions. 
Several commenters asked for clarification that ``similar services and 
actions'' include retrieving items from shelves, assistance in reaching 
a marginally accessible seat, pushing a barrier aside in order to 
provide an accessible route, or assistance in removing a sweater or 
coat. While retrieving an item from a shelf might be an ``auxiliary aid 
or service'' for a blind person who could not locate the item without 
assistance, it might be a readily achievable alternative to barrier 
removal for a person using a wheelchair who could not reach the shelf, 
or a reasonable modification to a self-service policy for an individual 
who lacked the ability to grasp the item. (Of course, a store would not 
be required to provide a personal shopper.) As explained above, 
auxiliary aids and services are those aids and services required to 
provide effective communications. Other forms of assistance are more 
appropriately addressed by other provisions of the final rule.
    The auxiliary aid requirement is a flexible one. A public 
accommodation can choose among various alternatives as long as the 
result is effective communication. For example, a restaurant would not 
be required to provide menus in Braille for patrons who are blind, if 
the waiters in the restaurant are made available to read the menu. 
Similarly, a clothing boutique would not be required to have Brailled 
price tags if sales personnel provide price information orally upon 
request; and a bookstore would not be required to make available a sign 
language interpreter, because effective communication can be conducted 
by notepad.
    A critical determination is what constitutes an effective auxiliary 
aid or service. The Department's proposed rule recommended that, in 
determining what auxiliary aid to use, the public accommodation consult 
with an individual before providing him or her with a particular 
auxiliary aid or service. This suggestion sparked a significant volume 
of public comment. Many persons with disabilities, particularly persons 
who are deaf or hard of hearing, recommended that the rule should 
require that public accommodations give ``primary consideration'' to the 
``expressed choice'' of an individual with a disability. These 
commenters asserted that the proposed rule was inconsistent with 
congressional intent of the ADA, with the Department's proposed rule 
implementing title II of the ADA, and with longstanding interpretations 
of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.
    Based upon a careful review of the ADA legislative history, the 
Department believes that Congress did not intend under title III to 
impose upon a public accommodation the requirement that it give primary 
consideration to the request of the individual with a disability. To the 
contrary, the legislative history demonstrates congressional intent to 
strongly encourage consulting with persons with disabilities. In its 
analysis of the ADA's auxiliary aids requirement for public 
accommodations, the House Education and Labor Committee stated that it 
``expects'' that ``public accommodation(s) will consult with the 
individual with a disability before providing a particular auxiliary aid 
or service'' (Education and Labor report at 107). Some commenters also 
cited a different committee statement that used mandatory language as 
evidence of legislative intent to require primary consideration. 
However, this statement was made in the context of reasonable 
accommodations required by title I with respect to employment (Education 
and Labor report at 67). Thus, the Department finds that strongly 
encouraging consultation with

[[Page 715]]

persons with disabilities, in lieu of mandating primary consideration of 
their expressed choice, is consistent with congressional intent.
    The Department wishes to emphasize that public accommodations must 
take steps necessary to ensure that an individual with a disability will 
not be excluded, denied services, segregated or otherwise treated 
differently from other individuals because of the use of inappropriate 
or ineffective auxiliary aids. In those situations requiring an 
interpreter, the public accommodations must secure the services of a 
qualified interpreter, unless an undue burden would result.
    In the analysis of Sec. 36.303(c) in the proposed rule, the 
Department gave as an example the situation where a note pad and written 
materials were insufficient to permit effective communication in a 
doctor's office when the matter to be decided was whether major surgery 
was necessary. Many commenters objected to this statement, asserting 
that it gave the impression that only decisions about major surgery 
would merit the provision of a sign language interpreter. The statement 
would, as the commenters also claimed, convey the impression to other 
public accommodations that written communications would meet the 
regulatory requirements in all but the most extreme situations. The 
Department, when using the example of major surgery, did not intend to 
limit the provision of interpreter services to the most extreme 
situations.
    Other situations may also require the use of interpreters to ensure 
effective communication depending on the facts of the particular case. 
It is not difficult to imagine a wide range of communications involving 
areas such as health, legal matters, and finances that would be 
sufficiently lengthy or complex to require an interpreter for effective 
communication. In some situations, an effective alternative to use of a 
notepad or an interpreter may be the use of a computer terminal upon 
which the representative of the public accommodation and the customer or 
client can exchange typewritten messages.
    Section 36.303(d) specifically addresses requirements for TDD's. 
Partly because of the availability of telecommunications relay services 
to be established under title IV of the ADA, Sec. 36.303(d)(2) provides 
that a public accommodation is not required to use a telecommunication 
device for the deaf (TDD) in receiving or making telephone calls 
incident to its operations. Several commenters were concerned that relay 
services would not be sufficient to provide effective access in a number 
of situations. Commenters argued that relay systems (1) do not provide 
effective access to the automated systems that require the caller to 
respond by pushing a button on a touch tone phone, (2) cannot operate 
fast enough to convey messages on answering machines, or to permit a TDD 
user to leave a recorded message, and (3) are not appropriate for 
calling crisis lines relating to such matters as rape, domestic 
violence, child abuse, and drugs where confidentiality is a concern. The 
Department believes that it is more appropriate for the Federal 
Communications Commission to address these issues in its rulemaking 
under title IV.
    A public accommodation is, however, required to make a TDD available 
to an individual with impaired hearing or speech, if it customarily 
offers telephone service to its customers, clients, patients, or 
participants on more than an incidental convenience basis. Where entry 
to a place of public accommodation requires use of a security entrance 
telephone, a TDD or other effective means of communication must be 
provided for use by an individual with impaired hearing or speech.
    In other words, individual retail stores, doctors' offices, 
restaurants, or similar establishments are not required by this section 
to have TDD's, because TDD users will be able to make inquiries, 
appointments, or reservations with such establishments through the relay 
system established under title IV of the ADA. The public accommodation 
will likewise be able to contact TDD users through the relay system. On 
the other hand, hotels, hospitals, and other similar establishments that 
offer nondisabled individuals the opportunity to make outgoing telephone 
calls on more than an incidental convenience basis must provide a TDD on 
request.
    Section 36.303(e) requires places of lodging that provide 
televisions in five or more guest rooms and hospitals to provide, upon 
request, a means for decoding closed captions for use by an individual 
with impaired hearing. Hotels should also provide a TDD or similar 
device at the front desk in order to take calls from guests who use 
TDD's in their rooms. In this way guests with hearing impairments can 
avail themselves of such hotel services as making inquiries of the front 
desk and ordering room service. The term ``hospital'' is used in its 
general sense and should be interpreted broadly.
    Movie theaters are not required by Sec. 36.303 to present open-
captioned films. However, other public accommodations that impart verbal 
information through soundtracks on films, video tapes, or slide shows 
are required to make such information accessible to persons with hearing 
impairments. Captioning is one means to make the information accessible 
to individuals with disabilities.
    The rule specifies that auxiliary aids and services include the 
acquisition or modification of equipment or devices. For example, tape 
players used for an audio-guided tour of a museum exhibit may require 
the addition of Brailled adhesive labels to the buttons on a reasonable 
number of the tape players to

[[Page 716]]

facilitate their use by individuals who are blind. Similarly, a hotel 
conference center may need to provide permanent or portable assistive 
listening systems for persons with hearing impairments.
    As provided in Sec. 36.303(f), a public accommodation is not 
required to provide any particular aid or service that would result 
either in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the goods, services, 
facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations offered or in an 
undue burden. Both of these statutory limitations are derived from 
existing regulations and caselaw under section 504 and are to be applied 
on a case-by-case basis (see, e.g., 28 CFR 39.160(d) and Southeastern 
Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397 (1979)). Congress intended that 
``undue burden'' under Sec. 36.303 and ``undue hardship,'' which is 
used in the employment provisions of title I of the ADA, should be 
determined on a case-by-case basis under the same standards and in light 
of the same factors (Judiciary report at 59). The rule, therefore, in 
accordance with the definition of undue hardship in section 101(10) of 
the ADA, defines undue burden as ``significant difficulty or expense'' 
(see Sec. Sec. 36.104 and 36.303(a)) and requires that undue burden be 
determined in light of the factors listed in the definition in 36.104.
    Consistent with regulations implementing section 504 in federally 
conducted programs (see, e.g., 28 CFR 39.160(d)), Sec. 36.303(f) 
provides that the fact that the provision of a particular auxiliary aid 
or service would result in an undue burden does not relieve a public 
accommodation from the duty to furnish an alternative auxiliary aid or 
service, if available, that would not result in such a burden.
    Section 36.303(g) of the proposed rule has been deleted from this 
section and included in a new Sec. 36.306. That new section continues 
to make clear that the auxiliary aids requirement does not mandate the 
provision of individually prescribed devices, such as prescription 
eyeglasses or hearing aids.
    The costs of compliance with the requirements of this section may 
not be financed by surcharges limited to particular individuals with 
disabilities or any group of individuals with disabilities (Sec. 
36.301(c)).

                   Section 36.304 Removal of Barriers

    Section 36.304 requires the removal of architectural barriers and 
communication barriers that are structural in nature in existing 
facilities, where such removal is readily achievable, i.e., easily 
accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or 
expense. This requirement is based on section 302(b)(2)(A)(iv) of the 
ADA.
    A number of commenters interpreted the phrase ``communication 
barriers that are structural in nature'' broadly to encompass the 
provision of communications devices such as TDD's, telephone handset 
amplifiers, assistive listening devices, and digital check-out displays. 
The statute, however, as read by the Department, limits the application 
of the phrase ``communications barriers that are structural in nature'' 
to those barriers that are an integral part of the physical structure of 
a facility. In addition to the communications barriers posed by 
permanent signage and alarm systems noted by Congress (see Education and 
Labor report at 110), the Department would also include among the 
communications barriers covered by Sec. 36.304 the failure to provide 
adequate sound buffers, and the presence of physical partitions that 
hamper the passage of sound waves between employees and customers. Given 
that Sec. 36.304's proper focus is on the removal of physical barriers, 
the Department believes that the obligation to provide communications 
equipment and devices such as TDD's, telephone handset amplifiers, 
assistive listening devices, and digital check-out displays is more 
appropriately determined by the requirements for auxiliary aids and 
services under Sec. 36.303 (see Education and Labor report at 107-108). 
The obligation to remove communications barriers that are structural in 
nature under Sec. 36.304, of course, is independent of any obligation 
to provide auxiliary aids and services under Sec. 36.303.
    The statutory provision also requires the readily achievable removal 
of certain barriers in existing vehicles and rail passenger cars. This 
transportation requirement is not included in Sec. 36.304, but rather 
in Sec. 36.310(b) of the rule.
    In striking a balance between guaranteeing access to individuals 
with disabilities and recognizing the legitimate cost concerns of 
businesses and other private entities, the ADA establishes different 
standards for existing facilities and new construction. In existing 
facilities, which are the subject of Sec. 36.304, where retrofitting 
may prove costly, a less rigorous degree of accessibility is required 
than in the case of new construction and alterations (see Sec. Sec. 
36.401-36.406) where accessibility can be more conveniently and 
economically incorporated in the initial stages of design and 
construction.
    For example, a bank with existing automatic teller machines (ATM's) 
would have to remove barriers to the use of the ATM's, if it is readily 
achievable to do so. Whether or not it is necessary to take actions such 
as ramping a few steps or raising or lowering an ATM would be determined 
by whether the actions can be accomplished easily and without much 
difficulty or expense.
    On the other hand, a newly constructed bank with ATM's would be 
required by Sec. 36.401 to have an ATM that is ``readily accessible to 
and usable by'' persons with disabilities in accordance with 
accessibility guidelines incorporated under Sec. 36.406.
    The requirement to remove architectural barriers includes the 
removal of physical

[[Page 717]]

barriers of any kind. For example, Sec. 36.304 requires the removal, 
when readily achievable, of barriers caused by the location of temporary 
or movable structures, such as furniture, equipment, and display racks. 
In order to provide access to individuals who use wheelchairs, for 
example, restaurants may need to rearrange tables and chairs, and 
department stores may need to reconfigure display racks and shelves. As 
stated in Sec. 36.304(f), such actions are not readily achievable to 
the extent that they would result in a significant loss of selling or 
serving space. If the widening of all aisles in selling or serving areas 
is not readily achievable, then selected widening should be undertaken 
to maximize the amount of merchandise or the number of tables accessible 
to individuals who use wheelchairs. Access to goods and services 
provided in any remaining inaccessible areas must be made available 
through alternative methods to barrier removal, as required by Sec. 
36.305.
    Because the purpose of title III of the ADA is to ensure that public 
accommodations are accessible to their customers, clients, or patrons 
(as opposed to their employees, who are the focus of title I), the 
obligation to remove barriers under Sec. 36.304 does not extend to 
areas of a facility that are used exclusively as employee work areas.
    Section 36.304(b) provides a wide-ranging list of the types of 
modest measures that may be taken to remove barriers and that are likely 
to be readily achievable. The list includes examples of measures, such 
as adding raised letter markings on elevator control buttons and 
installing flashing alarm lights, that would be used to remove 
communications barriers that are structural in nature. It is not an 
exhaustive list, but merely an illustrative one. Moreover, the inclusion 
of a measure on this list does not mean that it is readily achievable in 
all cases. Whether or not any of these measures is readily achievable is 
to be determined on a case-by-case basis in light of the particular 
circumstances presented and the factors listed in the definition of 
readily achievable (Sec. 36.104).
    A public accommodation generally would not be required to remove a 
barrier to physical access posed by a flight of steps, if removal would 
require extensive ramping or an elevator. Ramping a single step, 
however, will likely be readily achievable, and ramping several steps 
will in many circumstances also be readily achievable. The readily 
achievable standard does not require barrier removal that requires 
extensive restructuring or burdensome expense. Thus, where it is not 
readily achievable to do, the ADA would not require a restaurant to 
provide access to a restroom reachable only by a flight of stairs.
    Like Sec. 36.405, this section permits deference to the national 
interest in preserving significant historic structures. Barrier removal 
would not be considered ``readily achievable'' if it would threaten or 
destroy the historic significance of a building or facility that is 
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places under 
the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470, et seq.), or is 
designated as historic under State or local law.
    The readily achievable defense requires a less demanding level of 
exertion by a public accommodation than does the undue burden defense to 
the auxiliary aids requirements of Sec. 36.303. In that sense, it can 
be characterized as a ``lower'' standard than the undue burden standard. 
The readily achievable defense is also less demanding than the undue 
hardship defense in section 102(b)(5) of the ADA, which limits the 
obligation to make reasonable accommodation in employment. Barrier 
removal measures that are not easily accomplishable and are not able to 
be carried out without much difficulty or expense are not required under 
the readily achievable standard, even if they do not impose an undue 
burden or an undue hardship.
    Section 36.304(f)(1) of the proposed rule, which stated that 
``barrier removal is not readily achievable if it would result in 
significant loss of profit or significant loss of efficiency of 
operation,'' has been deleted from the final rule. Many commenters 
objected to this provision because it impermissibly introduced the 
notion of profit into a statutory standard that did not include it. 
Concern was expressed that, in order for an action not to be considered 
readily achievable, a public accommodation would inappropriately have to 
show, for example, not only that the action could not be done without 
``much difficulty or expense'', but that a significant loss of profit 
would result as well. In addition, some commenters asserted use of the 
word ``significant,'' which is used in the definition of undue hardship 
under title I (the standard for interpreting the meaning of undue burden 
as a defense to title III's auxiliary aids requirements) (see Sec. Sec. 
36.104, 36.303(f)), blurs the fact that the readily achievable standard 
requires a lower level of effort on the part of a public accommodation 
than does the undue burden standard.
    The obligation to engage in readily achievable barrier removal is a 
continuing one. Over time, barrier removal that initially was not 
readily achievable may later be required because of changed 
circumstances. Many commenters expressed support for the Department's 
position that the obligation to comply with Sec. 36.304 is continuing 
in nature. Some urged that the rule require public accommodations to 
assess their compliance on at least an annual basis in light of changes 
in resources and other factors that would be relevant to determining 
what barrier removal measures would be readily achievable.

[[Page 718]]

    Although the obligation to engage in readily achievable barrier 
removal is clearly a continuing duty, the Department has declined to 
establish any independent requirement for an annual assessment or self-
evaluation. It is best left to the public accommodations subject to 
Sec. 36.304 to establish policies to assess compliance that are 
appropriate to the particular circumstances faced by the wide range of 
public accommodations covered by the ADA. However, even in the absence 
of an explicit regulatory requirement for periodic self-evaluations, the 
Department still urges public accommodations to establish procedures for 
an ongoing assessment of their compliance with the ADA's barrier removal 
requirements. The Department recommends that this process include 
appropriate consultation with individuals with disabilities or 
organizations representing them. A serious effort at self-assessment and 
consultation can diminish the threat of litigation and save resources by 
identifying the most efficient means of providing required access.
    The Department has been asked for guidance on the best means for 
public accommodations to comply voluntarily with this section. Such 
information is more appropriately part of the Department's technical 
assistance effort and will be forthcoming over the next several months. 
The Department recommends, however, the development of an implementation 
plan designed to achieve compliance with the ADA's barrier removal 
requirements before they become effective on January 26, 1992. Such a 
plan, if appropriately designed and diligently executed, could serve as 
evidence of a good faith effort to comply with the requirements of Sec. 
36.104. In developing an implementation plan for readily achievable 
barrier removal, a public accommodation should consult with local 
organizations representing persons with disabilities and solicit their 
suggestions for cost-effective means of making individual places of 
public accommodation accessible. Such organizations may also be helpful 
in allocating scarce resources and establishing priorities. Local 
associations of businesses may want to encourage this process and serve 
as the forum for discussions on the local level between disability 
rights organizations and local businesses.
    Section 36.304(c) recommends priorities for public accommodations in 
removing barriers in existing facilities. Because the resources 
available for barrier removal may not be adequate to remove all existing 
barriers at any given time, Sec. 36.304(c) suggests priorities for 
determining which types of barriers should be mitigated or eliminated 
first. The purpose of these priorities is to facilitate long-term 
business planning and to maximize, in light of limited resources, the 
degree of effective access that will result from any given level of 
expenditure.
    Although many commenters expressed support for the concept of 
establishing priorities, a significant number objected to their 
mandatory nature in the proposed rule. The Department shares the concern 
of these commenters that mandatory priorities would increase the 
likelihood of litigation and inappropriately reduce the discretion of 
public accommodations to determine the most effective mix of barrier 
removal measures to undertake in particular circumstances. Therefore, in 
the final rule the priorities are no longer mandatory.
    In response to comments that the priorities failed to address 
communications issues, the Department wishes to emphasize that the 
priorities encompass the removal of communications barriers that are 
structural in nature. It would be counter to the ADA's carefully wrought 
statutory scheme to include in this provision the wide range of 
communication devices that are required by the ADA's provisions on 
auxiliary aids and services. The final rule explicitly includes Brailled 
and raised letter signage and visual alarms among the examples of steps 
to remove barriers provided in Sec. 36.304(c)(2).
    Section 36.304(c)(1) places the highest priority on measures that 
will enable individuals with disabilities to physically enter a place of 
public accommodation. This priority on ``getting through the door'' 
recognizes that providing actual physical access to a facility from 
public sidewalks, public transportation, or parking is generally 
preferable to any alternative arrangements in terms of both business 
efficiency and the dignity of individuals with disabilities.
    The next priority, which is established in Sec. 36.304(c)(2), is 
for measures that provide access to those areas of a place of public 
accommodation where goods and services are made available to the public. 
For example, in a hardware store, to the extent that it is readily 
achievable to do so, individuals with disabilities should be given 
access not only to assistance at the front desk, but also access, like 
that available to other customers, to the retail display areas of the 
store.
    The Department agrees with those commenters who argued that access 
to the areas where goods and services are provided is generally more 
important than the provision of restrooms. Therefore, the final rule 
reverses priorities two and three of the proposed rule in order to give 
lower priority to accessible restrooms. Consequently, the third priority 
in the final rule (Sec. 36.304(c)(3)) is for measures to provide access 
to restroom facilities and the last priority is placed on any remaining 
measures required to remove barriers.
    Section 36.304(d) requires that measures taken to remove barriers 
under Sec. 36.304 be subject to subpart D's requirements for 
alterations (except for the path of travel requirements in Sec. 
36.403). It only permits deviations from the subpart D requirements

[[Page 719]]

when compliance with those requirements is not readily achievable. In 
such cases, Sec. 36.304(d) permits measures to be taken that do not 
fully comply with the subpart D requirements, so long as the measures do 
not pose a significant risk to the health or safety of individuals with 
disabilities or others.
    This approach represents a change from the proposed rule which 
stated that ``readily achievable'' measures taken solely to remove 
barriers under Sec. 36.304 are exempt from the alterations requirements 
of subpart D. The intent of the proposed rule was to maximize the 
flexibility of public accommodations in undertaking barrier removal by 
allowing deviations from the technical standards of subpart D. It was 
thought that allowing slight deviations would provide access and release 
additional resources for expanding the amount of barrier removal that 
could be obtained under the readily achievable standard.
    Many commenters, however, representing both businesses and 
individuals with disabilities, questioned this approach because of the 
likelihood that unsafe or ineffective measures would be taken in the 
absence of the subpart D standards for alterations as a reference point. 
Some advocated a rule requiring strict compliance with the subpart D 
standard.
    The Department in the final rule has adopted the view of many 
commenters that (1) public accommodations should in the first instance 
be required to comply with the subpart D standards for alterations where 
it is readily achievable to do so and (2) safe, readily achievable 
measures must be taken when compliance with the subpart D standards is 
not readily achievable. Reference to the subpart D standards in this 
manner will promote certainty and good design at the same time that 
permitting slight deviations will expand the amount of barrier removal 
that may be achieved under Sec. 36.304.
    Because of the inconvenience to individuals with disabilities and 
the safety problems involved in the use of portable ramps, Sec. 
36.304(e) permits the use of a portable ramp to comply with Sec. 
36.304(a) only when installation of a permanent ramp is not readily 
achievable. In order to promote safety, Sec. 36.304(e) requires that 
due consideration be given to the incorporation of features such as 
nonslip surfaces, railings, anchoring, and strength of materials in any 
portable ramp that is used.
    Temporary facilities brought in for use at the site of a natural 
disaster are subject to the barrier removal requirements of Sec. 
36.304.
    A number of commenters requested clarification regarding how to 
determine when a public accommodation has discharged its obligation to 
remove barriers in existing facilities. For example, is a hotel required 
by Sec. 36.304 to remove barriers in all of its guest rooms? Or is some 
lesser percentage adequate? A new paragraph (g) has been added to Sec. 
36.304 to address this issue. The Department believes that the degree of 
barrier removal required under Sec. 36.304 may be less, but certainly 
would not be required to exceed, the standards for alterations under the 
ADA Accessibility Guidelines incorporated by subpart D of this part 
(ADAAG). The ADA's requirements for readily achievable barrier removal 
in existing facilities are intended to be substantially less rigorous 
than those for new construction and alterations. It, therefore, would be 
obviously inappropriate to require actions under Sec. 36.304 that would 
exceed the ADAAG requirements. Hotels, then, in order to satisfy the 
requirements of Sec. 36.304, would not be required to remove barriers 
in a higher percentage of rooms than required by ADAAG. If relevant 
standards for alterations are not provided in ADAAG, then reference 
should be made to the standards for new construction.

             Section 36.305 Alternatives to Barrier Removal

    Section 36.305 specifies that where a public accommodation can 
demonstrate that removal of a barrier is not readily achievable, the 
public accommodation must make its goods, services, facilities, 
privileges, advantages, or accommodations available through alternative 
methods, if such methods are readily achievable. This requirement is 
based on section 302(b)(2)(A)(v) of the ADA.
    For example, if it is not readily achievable for a retail store to 
raise, lower, or remove shelves or to rearrange display racks to provide 
accessible aisles, the store must, if readily achievable, provide a 
clerk or take other alternative measures to retrieve inaccessible 
merchandise. Similarly, if it is not readily achievable to ramp a long 
flight of stairs leading to the front door of a restaurant or a 
pharmacy, the restaurant or the pharmacy must take alternative measures, 
if readily achievable, such as providing curb service or home delivery. 
If, within a restaurant, it is not readily achievable to remove physical 
barriers to a certain section of a restaurant, the restaurant must, 
where it is readily achievable to do so, offer the same menu in an 
accessible area of the restaurant.
    Where alternative methods are used to provide access, a public 
accommodation may not charge an individual with a disability for the 
costs associated with the alternative method (see Sec. 36.301(c)). 
Further analysis of the issue of charging for alternative measures may 
be found in the preamble discussion of Sec. 36.301(c).
    In some circumstances, because of security considerations, some 
alternative methods may not be readily achievable. The rule does not 
require a cashier to leave his or her post to retrieve items for 
individuals with disabilities, if there are no other employees on duty.

[[Page 720]]

    Section 36.305(c) of the proposed rule has been deleted and the 
requirements have been included in a new Sec. 36.306. That section 
makes clear that the alternative methods requirement does not mandate 
the provision of personal devices, such as wheelchairs, or services of a 
personal nature.
    In the final rule, Sec. 36.305(c) provides specific requirements 
regarding alternatives to barrier removal in multiscreen cinemas. In 
some situations, it may not be readily achievable to remove enough 
barriers to provide access to all of the theaters of a multiscreen 
cinema. If that is the case, Sec. 36.305(c) requires the cinema to 
establish a film rotation schedule that provides reasonable access for 
individuals who use wheelchairs to films being presented by the cinema. 
It further requires that reasonable notice be provided to the public as 
to the location and time of accessible showings. Methods for providing 
notice include appropriate use of the international accessibility symbol 
in a cinema's print advertising and the addition of accessibility 
information to a cinema's recorded telephone information line.

              Section 36.306 Personal Devices and Services

    The final rule includes a new Sec. 36.306, entitled ``Personal 
devices and services.'' Section 36.306 of the proposed rule, ``Readily 
achievable and undue burden: Factors to be considered,'' was deleted for 
the reasons described in the preamble discussion of the definition of 
the term ``readily achievable'' in Sec. 36.104. In place of Sec. Sec. 
36.303(g) and 36.305(c) of the proposed rule, which addressed the issue 
of personal devices and services in the contexts of auxiliary aids and 
alternatives to barrier removal, Sec. 36.306 provides a general 
statement that the regulation does not require the provision of personal 
devices and services. This section states that a public accommodation is 
not required to provide its customers, clients, or participants with 
personal devices, such as wheelchairs; individually prescribed devices, 
such as prescription eyeglasses or hearing aids; or services of a 
personal nature including assistance in eating, toileting, or dressing.
    This statement serves as a limitation on all the requirements of the 
regulation. The personal devices and services limitation was intended to 
have general application in the proposed rule in all contexts where it 
was relevant. The final rule, therefore, clarifies, this point by 
including a general provision that will explicitly apply not just to 
auxiliary aids and services and alternatives to barrier removal, but 
across-the-board to include such relevant areas as modifications in 
policies, practices, and procedures (Sec. 36.302) and examinations and 
courses (Sec. 36.309), as well.
    The Department wishes to clarify that measures taken as alternatives 
to barrier removal, such as retrieving items from shelves or providing 
curb service or home delivery, are not to be considered personal 
services. Similarly, minimal actions that may be required as 
modifications in policies, practices, or procedures under Sec. 36.302, 
such as a waiter's removing the cover from a customer's straw, a 
kitchen's cutting up food into smaller pieces, or a bank's filling out a 
deposit slip, are not services of a personal nature within the meaning 
of Sec. 36.306. (Of course, such modifications may be required under 
Sec. 36.302 only if they are ``reasonable.'') Similarly, this section 
does not preclude the short-term loan of personal receivers that are 
part of an assistive listening system.
    Of course, if personal services are customarily provided to the 
customers or clients of a public accommodation, e.g., in a hospital or 
senior citizen center, then these personal services should also be 
provided to persons with disabilities using the public accommodation.

               Section 36.307 Accessible or Special Goods.

    Section 36.307 establishes that the rule does not require a public 
accommodation to alter its inventory to include accessible or special 
goods with accessibility features that are designed for, or facilitate 
use by, individuals with disabilities. As specified in Sec. 36.307(c), 
accessible or special goods include such items as Brailled versions of 
books, books on audio-cassettes, closed captioned video tapes, special 
sizes or lines of clothing, and special foods to meet particular dietary 
needs.
    The purpose of the ADA's public accommodations requirements is to 
ensure accessibility to the goods offered by a public accommodation, not 
to alter the nature or mix of goods that the public accommodation has 
typically provided. In other words, a bookstore, for example, must make 
its facilities and sales operations accessible to individuals with 
disabilities, but is not required to stock Brailled or large print 
books. Similarly, a video store must make its facilities and rental 
operations accessible, but is not required to stock closed-captioned 
video tapes. The Department has been made aware, however, that the most 
recent titles in video-tape rental establishments are, in fact, closed 
captioned.
    Although a public accommodation is not required by Sec. 36.307(a) 
to modify its inventory, it is required by Sec. 36.307(b), at the 
request of an individual with disabilities, to order accessible or 
special goods that it does not customarily maintain in stock if, in the 
normal course of its operation, it makes special orders for unstocked 
goods, and if the accessible or special goods can be obtained from a 
supplier with whom the public accommodation customarily does business. 
For example, a clothing store would be required to order specially-sized 
clothing at the request

[[Page 721]]

of an individual with a disability, if it customarily makes special 
orders for clothing that it does not keep in stock, and if the clothing 
can be obtained from one of the store's customary suppliers.
    One commenter asserted that the proposed rule could be interpreted 
to require a store to special order accessible or special goods of all 
types, even if only one type is specially ordered in the normal course 
of its business. The Department, however, intends for Sec. 36.307(b) to 
require special orders only of those particular types of goods for which 
a public accommodation normally makes special orders. For example, a 
book and recording store would not have to specially order Brailled 
books if, in the normal course of its business, it only specially orders 
recordings and not books.

                Section 36.308 Seating in Assembly Areas.

    Section 36.308 establishes specific requirements for removing 
barriers to physical access in assembly areas, which include such 
facilities as theaters, concert halls, auditoriums, lecture halls, and 
conference rooms. This section does not address the provision of 
auxiliary aids or the removal of communications barriers that are 
structural in nature. These communications requirements are the focus of 
other provisions of the regulation (see Sec. Sec. 36.303-36.304).
    Individuals who use wheelchairs historically have been relegated to 
inferior seating in the back of assembly areas separate from 
accompanying family members and friends. The provisions of Sec. 36.308 
are intended to promote integration and equality in seating.
    In some instances it may not be readily achievable for auditoriums 
or theaters to remove seats to allow individuals with wheelchairs to sit 
next to accompanying family members or friends. In these situations, the 
final rule retains the requirement that the public accommodation provide 
portable chairs or other means to allow the accompanying individuals to 
sit with the persons in wheelchairs. Persons in wheelchairs should have 
the same opportunity to enjoy movies, plays, and similar events with 
their families and friends, just as other patrons do. The final rule 
specifies that portable chairs or other means to permit family members 
or companions to sit with individuals who use wheelchairs must be 
provided only when it is readily achievable to do so.
    In order to facilitate seating of wheelchair users who wish to 
transfer to existing seating, paragraph (a)(1) of the final rule adds a 
requirement that, to the extent readily achievable, a reasonable number 
of seats with removable aisle-side armrests must be provided. Many 
persons in wheelchairs are able to transfer to existing seating with 
this relatively minor modification. This solution avoids the potential 
safety hazard created by the use of portable chairs and fosters 
integration. The final ADA Accessibility Guidelines incorporated by 
subpart D (ADAAG) also add a requirement regarding aisle seating that 
was not in the proposed guidelines. In situations when a person in a 
wheelchair transfers to existing seating, the public accommodation shall 
provide assistance in handling the wheelchair of the patron with the 
disability.
    Likewise, consistent vith ADAAG, the final rule adds in Sec. 
36.308(a)(1)(ii)(B) a requirement that, to the extent readily 
achievable, wheelchair seating provide lines of sight and choice of 
admission prices comparable to those for members of the general public.
    Finally, because Congress intended that the requirements for barrier 
removal in existing facilities be substantially less rigorous than those 
required for new construction and alterations, the final rule clarifies 
in Sec. 36.308(a)(3) that in no event can the requirements for existing 
facilities be interpreted to exceed the standards for alterations under 
ADAAG. For example, Sec. 4.33 of ADAAG only requires wheelchair spaces 
to be provided in more than one location when the seating capacity of 
the assembly area exceeds 300. Therefore, paragraph (a) of Sec. 36.308 
may not be interpreted to require readily achievable dispersal of 
wheelchair seating in assembly areas with 300 or fewer seats. Similarly, 
Sec. 4.1.3(19) of ADAAG requires six accessible wheelchair locations in 
an assembly area with 301 to 500 seats. The reasonable number of 
wheelchair locations required by paragraph (a), therefore, may be less 
than six, but may not be interpreted to exceed six.

       Proposed Section 36.309 Purchase of Furniture and Equipment

    Section 36.309 of the proposed rule would have required that newly 
purchased furniture or equipment made available for use at a place of 
public accommodation be accessible, to the extent such furniture or 
equipment is available, unless this requirement would fundamentally 
alter the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or 
accommodations offered, or would not be readily achievable. Proposed 
Sec. 36.309 has been omitted from the final rule because the Department 
has determined that its requirements are more properly addressed under 
other sections, and because there are currently no appropriate 
accessibility standards addressing many types of furniture and 
equipment.
    Some types of equipment will be required to meet the accessibility 
requirements of subpart D. For example, ADAAG establishes technical and 
scoping requirements in new construction and alterations for automated 
teller machines and telephones. Purchase or modification of equipment is 
required in certain instances by the provisions in Sec. Sec. 36.201 and 
36.202. For example, an arcade may need

[[Page 722]]

to provide accessible video machines in order to ensure full and equal 
enjoyment of the facilities and to provide an opportunity to participate 
in the services and facilities it provides. The barrier removal 
requirements of Sec. 36.304 will apply as well to furniture and 
equipment (lowering shelves, rearranging furniture, adding Braille 
labels to a vending machine).

                 Section 36.309 Examinations and Courses

    Section 36.309(a) sets forth the general rule that any private 
entity that offers examinations or courses related to applications, 
licensing, certification, or credentialing for secondary or 
postsecondary education, professional, or trade purposes shall offer 
such examinations or courses in a place and manner accessible to persons 
with disabilities or offer alternative accessible arrangements for such 
individuals.
    Paragraph (a) restates section 309 of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act. Section 309 is intended to fill the gap that is 
created when licensing, certification, and other testing authorities are 
not covered by section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act or title II of the 
ADA. Any such authority that is covered by section 504, because of the 
receipt of Federal money, or by title II, because it is a function of a 
State or local government, must make all of its programs accessible to 
persons with disabilities, which includes physical access as well as 
modifications in the way the test is administered, e.g., extended time, 
written instructions, or assistance of a reader.
    Many licensing, certification, and testing authorities are not 
covered by section 504, because no Federal money is received; nor are 
they covered by title II of the ADA because they are not State or local 
agencies. However, States often require the licenses provided by such 
authorities in order for an individual to practice a particular 
profession or trade. Thus, the provision was included in the ADA in 
order to assure that persons with disabilities are not foreclosed from 
educational, professional, or trade opportunities because an examination 
or course is conducted in an inaccessible site or without needed 
modifications.
    As indicated in the ``Application'' section of this part (Sec. 
36.102), Sec. 36.309 applies to any private entity that offers the 
specified types of examinations or courses. This is consistent with 
section 309 of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which states that 
the requirements apply to ``any person'' offering examinations or 
courses.
    The Department received a large number of comments on this section, 
reflecting the importance of ensuring that the key gateways to education 
and employment are open to individuals with disabilities. The most 
frequent comments were objections to the fundamental alteration and 
undue burden provisions in Sec. Sec. 36.309 (b)(3) and (c)(3) and to 
allowing courses and examinations to be provided through alternative 
accessible arrangements, rather than in an integrated setting.
    Although section 309 of the Act does not refer to a fundamental 
alteration or undue burden limitation, those limitations do appear in 
section 302(b)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, which establishes the obligation 
of public accommodations to provide auxiliary aids and services. The 
Department, therefore, included it in the paragraphs of Sec. 36.309 
requiring the provision of auxiliary aids. One commenter argued that 
similar limitations should apply to all of the requirements of Sec. 
36.309, but the Department did not consider this extension appropriate.
    Commenters who objected to permitting ``alternative accessible 
arrangements'' argued that such arrangements allow segregation and 
should not be permitted, unless they are the least restrictive available 
alternative, for example, for someone who cannot leave home. Some 
commenters made a distinction between courses, where interaction is an 
important part of the educational experience, and examinations, where it 
may be less important. Because the statute specifically authorizes 
alternative accessible arrangements as a method of meeting the 
requirements of section 309, the Department has not adopted this 
suggestion. The Department notes, however, that, while examinations of 
the type covered by Sec. 36.309 may not be covered elsewhere in the 
regulation, courses will generally be offered in a ``place of 
education,'' which is included in the definition of ``place of public 
accommodation'' in Sec. 36.104, and, therefore, will be subject to the 
integrated setting requirement of Sec. 36.203.
    Section 36.309(b) sets forth specific requirements for examinations. 
Examinations covered by this section would include a bar exam or the 
Scholastic Aptitude Test prepared by the Educational Testing Service. 
Paragraph (b)(1) is adopted from the Department of Education's section 
504 regulation on admission tests to postsecondary educational programs 
(34 CFR 104.42(b)(3)). Paragraph (b)(1)(i) requires that a private 
entity offering an examination covered by the section must assure that 
the examination is selected and administered so as to best ensure that 
the examination accurately reflects an individual's aptitude or 
achievement level or other factor the examination purports to measure, 
rather than reflecting the individual's impaired sensory, manual, or 
speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors that the 
examination purports to measure).
    Paragraph (b)(1)(ii) requires that any examination specially 
designed for individuals with disabilities be offered as often and in as 
timely a manner as other examinations. Some commenters noted that 
persons with disabilities may be required to travel long

[[Page 723]]

distances when the locations for examinations for individuals with 
disabilities are limited, for example, to only one city in a State 
instead of a variety of cities. The Department has therefore revised 
this paragraph to add a requirement that such examinations be offered at 
locations that are as convenient as the location of other examinations.
    Commenters representing organizations that administer tests wanted 
to be able to require individuals with disabilities to provide advance 
notice and appropriate documentation, at the applicants' expense, of 
their disabilities and of any modifications or aids that would be 
required. The Department agrees that such requirements are permissible, 
provided that they are not unreasonable and that the deadline for such 
notice is no earlier than the deadline for others applying to take the 
examination. Requiring individuals with disabilities to file earlier 
applications would violate the requirement that examinations designed 
for individuals with disabilities be offered in as timely a manner as 
other examinations.
    Examiners may require evidence that an applicant is entitled to 
modifications or aids as required by this section, but requests for 
documentation must be reasonable and must be limited to the need for the 
modification or aid requested. Appropriate documentation might include a 
letter from a physician or other professional, or evidence of a prior 
diagnosis or accommodation, such as eligibility for a special education 
program. The applicant may be required to bear the cost of providing 
such documentation, but the entity administering the examination cannot 
charge the applicant for the cost of any modifications or auxiliary 
aids, such as interpreters, provided for the examination.
    Paragraph (b)(1)(iii) requires that examinations be administered in 
facilities that are accessible to individuals with disabilities or 
alternative accessible arrangements are made.
    Paragraph (b)(2) gives examples of modifications to examinations 
that may be necessary in order to comply with this section. These may 
include providing more time for completion of the examination or a 
change in the manner of giving the examination, e.g., reading the 
examination to the individual.
    Paragraph (b)(3) requires the provision of auxiliary aids and 
services, unless the private entity offering the examination can 
demonstrate that offering a particular auxiliary aid would fundamentally 
alter the examination or result in an undue burden. Examples of 
auxiliary aids include taped examinations, interpreters or other 
effective methods of making aurally delivered materials available to 
individuals with hearing impairments, readers for individuals with 
visual impairments or learning disabilities, and other similar services 
and actions. The suggestion that individuals with learning disabilities 
may need readers is included, although it does not appear in the 
Department of Education regulation, because, in fact, some individuals 
with learning disabilities have visual perception problems and would 
benefit from a reader.
    Many commenters pointed out the importance of ensuring that 
modifications provide the individual with a disability an equal 
opportunity to demonstrate his or her knowledge or ability. For example, 
a reader who is unskilled or lacks knowledge of specific terminology 
used in the examination may be unable to convey the information in the 
questions or to follow the applicant's instructions effectively. 
Commenters pointed out that, for persons with visual impairments who 
read Braille, Braille provides the closest functional equivalent to a 
printed test. The Department has, therefore, added Brailled examinations 
to the examples of auxiliary aids and services that may be required. For 
similar reasons, the Department also added to the list of examples of 
auxiliary aids and services large print examinations and answer sheets; 
``qualified'' readers; and transcribers to write answers.
    A commenter suggested that the phrase ``fundamentally alter the 
examination'' in this paragraph of the proposed rule be revised to more 
accurately reflect the function affected. In the final rule the 
Department has substituted the phrase ``fundamentally alter the 
measurement of the skills or knowledge the examination is intended to 
test.''
    Paragraph (b)(4) gives examples of alternative accessible 
arrangements. For instance, the private entity might be required to 
provide the examination at an individual's home with a proctor. 
Alternative arrangements must provide conditions for individuals with 
disabilities that are comparable to the conditions under which other 
individuals take the examinations. In other words, an examination cannot 
be offered to an individual with a disability in a cold, poorly lit 
basement, if other individuals are given the examination in a warm, well 
lit classroom.
    Some commenters who provide examinations for licensing or 
certification for particular occupations or professions urged that they 
be permitted to refuse to provide modifications or aids for persons 
seeking to take the examinations if those individuals, because of their 
disabilities, would be unable to perform the essential functions of the 
profession or occupation for which the examination is given, or unless 
the disability is reasonably determined in advance as not being an 
obstacle to certification. The Department has not changed its rule based 
on this comment. An examination is one stage of a licensing or 
certification process. An individual should not be barred from 
attempting

[[Page 724]]

to pass that stage of the process merely because he or she might be 
unable to meet other requirements of the process. If the examination is 
not the first stage of the qualification process, an applicant may be 
required to complete the earlier stages prior to being admitted to the 
examination. On the other hand, the applicant may not be denied 
admission to the examination on the basis of doubts about his or her 
abilities to meet requirements that the examination is not designed to 
test.
    Paragraph (c) sets forth specific requirements for courses. 
Paragraph (c)(1) contains the general rule that any course covered by 
this section must be modified to ensure that the place and manner in 
which the course is given is accessible. Paragraph (c)(2) gives examples 
of possible modifications that might be required, including extending 
the time permitted for completion of the course, permitting oral rather 
than written delivery of an assignment by a person with a visual 
impairment, or adapting the manner in which the course is conducted 
(i.e., providing cassettes of class handouts to an individual with a 
visual impairment). In response to comments, the Department has added to 
the examples in paragraph (c)(2) specific reference to distribution of 
course materials. If course materials are published and available from 
other sources, the entity offering the course may give advance notice of 
what materials will be used so as to allow an individual to obtain them 
in Braille or on tape but materials provided by the course offerer must 
be made available in alternative formats for individuals with 
disabilities.
    In language similar to that of paragraph (b), paragraph (c)(3) 
requires auxiliary aids and services, unless a fundamental alteration or 
undue burden would result, and paragraph (c)(4) requires that courses be 
administered in accessible facilities. Paragraph (c)(5) gives examples 
of alternative accessible arrangements. These may include provision of 
the course through videotape, cassettes, or prepared notes. Alternative 
arrangements must provide comparable conditions to those provided to 
others, including similar lighting, room temperature, and the like. An 
entity offering a variety of courses, to fulfill continuing education 
requirements for a profession, for example, may not limit the selection 
or choice of courses available to individuals with disabilities.

     Section 36.310 Transportation Provided by Public Accommodations

    Section 36.310 contains specific provisions relating to public 
accommodations that provide transportation to their clients or 
customers. This section has been substantially revised in order to 
coordinate the requirements of this section with the requirements 
applicable to these transportation systems that will be contained in the 
regulations issued by the Secretary of Transportation pursuant to 
section 306 of the ADA, to be codified at 49 CFR part 37. The Department 
notes that, although the responsibility for issuing regulations 
applicable to transportation systems operated by public accommodations 
is divided between this Department and the Department of -
Transportation, enforcement authority is assigned only to the Department 
of Justice.
    The Department received relatively few comments on this section of 
the proposed rule. Most of the comments addressed issues that are not 
specifically addressed in this part, such as the standards for 
accessible vehicles and the procedure for determining whether equivalent 
service is provided. Those standards will be contained in the regulation 
issued by the Department of Transportation. Other commenters raised 
questions about the types of transportation that will be subject to this 
section. In response to these inquiries, the Department has revised the 
list of examples contained in the regulation.
    Paragraph (a)(1) states the general rule that covered public 
accommodations are subject to all of the specific provisions of subparts 
B, C, and D, except as provided in Sec. 36.310. Examples of operations 
covered by the requirements are listed in paragraph (a)(2). The stated 
examples include hotel and motel airport shuttle services, customer 
shuttle bus services operated by private companies and shopping centers, 
student transportation, and shuttle operations of recreational 
facilities such as stadiums, zoos, amusement parks, and ski resorts. 
This brief list is not exhaustive. The section applies to any fixed 
route or demand responsive transportation system operated by a public 
accommodation for the benefit of its clients or customers. The section 
does not apply to transportation services provided only to employees. 
Employee transportation will be subject to the regulations issued by the 
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to implement title I of the Act. 
However, if employees and customers or clients are served by the same 
transportation system, the provisions of this section will apply.
    Paragraph (b) specifically provides that a public accommodation 
shall remove transportation barriers in existing vehicles to the extent 
that it is readily achievable to do so, but that the installation of 
hydraulic or other lifts is not required.
    Paragraph (c) provides that public accommodations subject to this 
section shall comply with the requirements for transportation vehicles 
and systems contained in the regulations issued by the Secretary of 
Transportation.

[[Page 725]]

               Subpart D--New Construction and Alterations

    Subpart D implements section 303 of the Act, which requires that 
newly constructed or altered places of public accommodation or 
commercial facilities be readily accessible to and usable by individuals 
with disabilities. This requirement contemplates a high degree of 
convenient access. It is intended to ensure that patrons and employees 
of places of public accommodation and employees of commercial facilities 
are able to get to, enter, and use the facility.
    Potential patrons of places of public accommodation, such as retail 
establishments, should be able to get to a store, get into the store, 
and get to the areas where goods are being provided. Employees should 
have the same types of access, although those individuals require access 
to and around the employment area as well as to the area in which goods 
and services are provided.
    The ADA is geared to the future--its goal being that, over time, 
access will be the rule, rather than the exception. Thus, the Act only 
requires modest expenditures, of the type addressed in Sec. 36.304 of 
this part, to provide access to existing facilities not otherwise being 
altered, but requires all new construction and alterations to be 
accessible.
    The Act does not require new construction or alterations; it simply 
requires that, when a public accommodation or other private entity 
undertakes the construction or alteration of a facility subject to the 
Act, the newly constructed or altered facility must be made accessible. 
This subpart establishes the requirements for new construction and 
alterations.
    As explained under the discussion of the definition of ``facility,'' 
Sec. 36.104, pending development of specific requirements, the 
Department will not apply this subpart to places of public accommodation 
located in mobile units, boats, or other conveyances.

                     Section 36.401 New Construction

                                 General

    Section 36.401 implements the new construction requirements of the 
ADA. Section 303 (a)(1) of the Act provides that discrimination for 
purposes of section 302(a) of the Act includes a failure to design and 
construct facilities for first occupancy later than 30 months after the 
date of enactment (i.e., after January 26, 1993) that are readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.
    Paragraph 36.401(a)(1) restates the general requirement for 
accessible new construction. The proposed rule stated that ``any public 
accommodation or other private entity responsible for design and 
construction'' must ensure that facilities conform to this requirement. 
Various commenters suggested that the proposed language was not 
consistent with the statute because it substituted ``private entity 
responsible for design and construction'' for the statutory language; 
because it did not address liability on the part of architects, 
contractors, developers, tenants, owners, and other entities; and 
because it limited the liability of entities responsible for commercial 
facilities. In response, the Department has revised this paragraph to 
repeat the language of section 303(a) of the ADA. The Department will 
interpret this section in a manner consistent with the intent of the 
statute and with the nature of the responsibilities of the various 
entities for design, for construction, or for both.

              Designed and Constructed for First Occupancy

    According to paragraph (a)(2), a facility is subject to the new 
construction requirements only if a completed application for a building 
permit or permit extension is filed after January 26, 1992, and the 
facility is occupied after January 26, 1993.
    The proposed rule set forth for comment two alternative ways by 
which to determine what facilities are subject to the Act and what 
standards apply. Paragraph (a)(2) of the final rule is a slight 
variation on Option One in the proposed rule. The reasons for the 
Department's choice of Option One are discussed later in this section.
    Paragraph (a)(2) acknowledges that Congress did not contemplate 
having actual occupancy be the sole trigger for the accessibility 
requirements, because the statute prohibits a failure to ``design and 
construct for first occupancy,'' rather than requiring accessibility in 
facilities actually occupied after a particular date.
    The commenters overwhelmingly agreed with the Department's proposal 
to use a date certain; many cited the reasons given in the preamble to 
the proposed rule. First, it is helpful for designers and builders to 
have a fixed date for accessible design, so that they can determine 
accessibility requirements early in the planning and design stage. It is 
difficult to determine accessibility requirements in anticipation of the 
actual date of first occupancy because of unpredictable and 
uncontrollable events (e.g., strikes affecting suppliers or labor, or 
natural disasters) that may delay occupancy. To redesign or reconstruct 
portions of a facility if it begins to appear that occupancy will be 
later than anticipated would be quite costly. A fixed date also assists 
those responsible for enforcing, or monitoring compliance with, the 
statute, and those protected by it.
    The Department considered using as a trigger date for application of 
the accessibility standards the date on which a permit is granted. The 
Department chose instead the date on which a complete permit application 
is certified as received by the appropriate

[[Page 726]]

government entity. Almost all commenters agreed with this choice of a 
trigger date. This decision is based partly on information that several 
months or even years can pass between application for a permit and 
receipt of a permit. Design is virtually complete at the time an 
application is complete (i.e., certified to contain all the information 
required by the State, county, or local government). After an 
application is filed, delays may occur before the permit is granted due 
to numerous factors (not necessarily relating to accessibility): for 
example, hazardous waste discovered on the property, flood plain 
requirements, zoning disputes, or opposition to the project from various 
groups. These factors should not require redesign for accessibility if 
the application was completed before January 26, 1992. However, if the 
facility must be redesigned for other reasons, such as a change in 
density or environmental preservation, and the final permit is based on 
a new application, the rule would require accessibility if that 
application was certified complete after January 26, 1992.
    The certification of receipt of a complete application for a 
building permit is an appropriate point in the process because 
certifications are issued in writing by governmental authorities. In 
addition, this approach presents a clear and objective standard.
    However, a few commenters pointed out that in some jurisdictions it 
is not possible to receive a ``certification'' that an application is 
complete, and suggested that in those cases the fixed date should be the 
date on which an application for a permit is received by the government 
agency. The Department has included such a provision in Sec. 
36.401(a)(2)(i).
    The date of January 26, 1992, is relevant only with respect to the 
last application for a permit or permit extension for a facility. Thus, 
if an entity has applied for only a ``foundation'' permit, the date of 
that permit application has no effect, because the entity must also 
apply for and receive a permit at a later date for the actual 
superstructure. In this case, it is the date of the later application 
that would control, unless construction is not completed within the time 
allowed by the permit, in which case a third permit would be issued and 
the date of the application for that permit would be determinative for 
purposes of the rule.

 Choice of Option One for Defining ``Designed and Constructed for First 
                               Occupancy''

    Under the option the Department has chosen for determining 
applicability of the new construction standards, a building would be 
considered to be ``for first occupancy'' after January 26, 1993, only 
(1) if the last application for a building permit or permit extension 
for the facility is certified to be complete (or, in some jurisdictions, 
received) by a State, county, or local government after January 26, 
1992, and (2) if the first certificate of occupancy is issued after 
January 26, 1993. The Department also asked for comment on an Option 
Two, which would have imposed new construction requirements if a 
completed application for a building permit or permit extension was 
filed after the enactment of the ADA (July 26, 1990), and the facility 
was occupied after January 26, 1993.
    The request for comment on this issue drew a large number of 
comments expressing a wide range of views. Most business groups and some 
disability rights groups favored Option One, and some business groups 
and most disability rights groups favored Option Two. Individuals and 
government entities were equally divided; several commenters proposed 
other options.
    Those favoring Option One pointed out that it is more reasonable in 
that it allows time for those subject to the new construction 
requirements to anticipate those requirements and to receive technical 
assistance pursuant to the Act. Numerous commenters said that time 
frames for designing and constructing some types of facilities (for 
example, health care facilities) can range from two to four years or 
more. They expressed concerns that Option Two, which would apply to some 
facilities already under design or construction as of the date the Act 
was signed, and to some on which construction began shortly after 
enactment, could result in costly redesign or reconstruction of those 
facilities. In the same vein, some Option One supporters found Option 
Two objectionable on due process grounds. In their view, Option Two 
would mean that in July 1991 (upon issuance of the final DOJ rule) the 
responsible entities would learn that ADA standards had been in effect 
since July 26, 1990, and this would amount to retroactive application of 
standards. Numerous commenters characterized Option Two as having no 
support in the statute and Option One as being more consistent with 
congressional intent.
    Those who favored Option Two pointed out that it would include more 
facilities within the coverage of the new construction standards. They 
argued that because similar accessibility requirements are in effect 
under State laws, no hardship would be imposed by this option. Numerous 
commenters said that hardship would also be eliminated in light of their 
view that the ADA requires compliance with the Uniform Federal 
Accessibility Standards (UFAS) until issuance of DOJ standards. Those 
supporting Option Two claimed that it was more consistent with the 
statute and its legislative history.
    The Department has chosen Option One rather than Option Two, 
primarily on the

[[Page 727]]

basis of the language of three relevant sections of the statute. First, 
section 303(a) requires compliance with accessibility standards set 
forth, or incorporated by reference in, regulations to be issued by the 
Department of Justice. Standing alone, this section cannot be read to 
require compliance with the Department's standards before those 
standards are issued (through this rulemaking). Second, according to 
section 310 of the statute, section 303 becomes effective on January 26, 
1992. Thus, section 303 cannot impose requirements on the design of 
buildings before that date. Third, while section 306(d) of the Act 
requires compliance with UFAS if final regulations have not been issued, 
that provision cannot reasonably be read to take effect until July 26, 
1991, the date by which the Department of Justice must issue final 
regulations under title III.
    Option Two was based on the premise that the interim standards in 
section 306(d) take effect as of the ADA's enactment (July 26, 1990), 
rather than on the date by which the Department of Justice regulations 
are due to be issued (July 26, 1991). The initial clause of section 
306(d)(1) itself is silent on this question:
    If final regulations have not been issued pursuant to this section, 
for new construction for which a * * * building permit is obtained prior 
to the issuance of final regulations * * * (interim standards apply).
    The approach in Option Two relies partly on the language of section 
310 of the Act, which provides that section 306, the interim standards 
provision, takes effect on the date of enactment. Under this 
interpretation the interim standards provision would prevail over the 
operative provision, section 303, which requires that new construction 
be accessible and which becomes effective January 26, 1992. This 
approach would also require construing the language of section 306(d)(1) 
to take effect before the Department's standards are due to be issued. 
The preferred reading of section 306 is that it would require that, if 
the Department's final standards had not been issued by July 26, 1991, 
UFAS would apply to certain buildings until such time as the 
Department's standards were issued.

   General Substantive Requirements of the New Construction Provisions

    The rule requires, as does the statute, that covered newly 
constructed facilities be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with disabilities. The phrase ``readily accessible to and 
usable by individuals with disabilities'' is a term that, in slightly 
varied formulations, has been used in the Architectural Barriers Act of 
1968, the Fair Housing Act, the regulations implementing section 504 of 
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and current accessibility standards. It 
means, with respect to a facility or a portion of a facility, that it 
can be approached, entered, and used by individuals with disabilities 
(including mobility, sensory, and cognitive impairments) easily and 
conveniently. A facility that is constructed to meet the requirements of 
the rule's accessibility standards will be considered readily accessible 
and usable with respect to construction. To the extent that a particular 
type or element of a facility is not specifically addressed by the 
standards, the language of this section is the safest guide.
    A private entity that renders an ``accessible'' building 
inaccessible in its operation, through policies or practices, may be in 
violation of section 302 of the Act. For example, a private entity can 
render an entrance to a facility inaccessible by keeping an accessible 
entrance open only during certain hours (whereas the facility is 
available to others for a greater length of time). A facility could 
similarly be rendered inaccessible if a person with disabilities is 
significantly limited in her or his choice of a range of accommodations.
    Ensuring access to a newly constructed facility will include 
providing access to the facility from the street or parking lot, to the 
extent the responsible entity has control over the route from those 
locations. In some cases, the private entity will have no control over 
access at the point where streets, curbs, or sidewalks already exist, 
and in those instances the entity is encouraged to request modifications 
to a sidewalk, including installation of curb cuts, from a public entity 
responsible for them. However, as some commenters pointed out, there is 
no obligation for a private entity subject to title III of the ADA to 
seek or ensure compliance by a public entity with title II. Thus, 
although a locality may have an obligation under title II of the Act to 
install curb cuts at a particular location, that responsibility is 
separate from the private entity's title III obligation, and any 
involvement by a private entity in seeking cooperation from a public 
entity is purely voluntary in this context.

                               Work Areas

    Proposed paragraph 36.401(b) addressed access to employment areas, 
rather than to the areas where goods or services are being provided. The 
preamble noted that the proposed paragraph provided guidance for new 
construction and alterations until more specific guidance was issued by 
the ATBCB and reflected in this Department's regulation. The entire 
paragraph has been deleted from this section in the final rule. The 
concepts of paragraphs (b) (1), (2), and (5) of the proposed rule are 
included, with modifications and expansion, in ADAAG. Paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of the proposed rule, concerning fixtures and equipment, are not 
included in the rule or in ADAAG.
    Some commenters asserted that questions relating to new construction 
and alterations of work areas should be addressed by the

[[Page 728]]

EEOC under title I, as employment concerns. However, the legislative 
history of the statute clearly indicates that the new construction and 
alterations requirements of title III were intended to ensure 
accessibility of new facilities to all individuals, including employees. 
The language of section 303 sweeps broadly in its application to all 
public accommodations and commercial facilities. EEOC's title I 
regulations will address accessibility requirements that come into play 
when ``reasonable accommodation'' to individual employees or applicants 
with disabilities is mandated under title I.
    The issues dealt with in proposed Sec. 36.401(b) (1) and (2) are 
now addressed in ADAAG section 4.1.1(3). The Department's proposed 
paragraphs would have required that areas that will be used only by 
employees as work stations be constructed so that individuals with 
disabilities could approach, enter, and exit the areas. They would not 
have required that all individual work stations be constructed or 
equipped (for example, with shelves that are accessible or adaptable) to 
be accessible. This approach was based on the theory that, as long as an 
employee with disabilities could enter the building and get to and 
around the employment area, modifications in a particular work station 
could be instituted as a ``reasonable accommodation'' to that employee 
if the modifications were necessary and they did not constitute an undue 
hardship.
    Almost all of the commenters agreed with the proposal to require 
access to a work area but not to require accessibility of each 
individual work station. This principle is included in ADAAG 4.1.1(3). 
Several of the comments related to the requirements of the proposed 
ADAAG and have been addressed in the accessibility standards.
    Proposed paragraphs (b) (3) and (4) would have required that 
consideration be given to placing fixtures and equipment at accessible 
heights in the first instance, and to purchasing new equipment and 
fixtures that are adjustable. These paragraphs have not been included in 
the final rule because the rule in most instances does not establish 
accessibility standards for purchased equipment. (See discussion 
elsewhere in the preamble of proposed Sec. 36.309.) While the 
Department encourages entities to consider providing accessible or 
adjustable fixtures and equipment for employees, this rule does not 
require them to do so.
    Paragraph (b)(5) of proposed Sec. 36.401 clarified that proposed 
paragraph (b) did not limit the requirement that employee areas other 
than individual work stations must be accessible. For example, areas 
that are employee ``common use'' areas and are not solely used as work 
stations (e.g., employee lounges, cafeterias, health units, exercise 
facilities) are treated no differently under this regulation than other 
parts of a building; they must be constructed or altered in compliance 
with the accessibility standards. This principle is not stated in Sec. 
36.401 but is implicit in the requirements of this section and ADAAG.

               Commercial Facilities in Private Residences

    Section 36.401(b) of the final rule is a new provision relating to 
commercial facilities located in private residences. The proposed rule 
addressed these requirements in the preamble to Sec. 36.207, ``Places 
of public accommodation located in private residences.'' The preamble 
stated that the approach for commercial facilities would be the same as 
that for places of public accommodation, i.e., those portions used 
exclusively as a commercial facility or used as both a commercial 
facility and for residential purposes would be covered. Because 
commercial facilities are only subject to new construction and 
alterations requirements, however, the covered portions would only be 
subject to subpart D. This approach is reflected in Sec. 36.401(b)(1).
    The Department is aware that the statutory definition of 
``commercial facility'' excludes private residences because they are 
``expressly exempted from coverage under the Fair Housing Act of 1968, 
as amended.'' However, the Department interprets that exemption as 
applying only to facilities that are exclusively residential. When a 
facility is used as both a residence and a commercial facility, the 
exemption does not apply.
    Paragraph (b)(2) is similar to the new paragraph (b) under Sec. 
36.207, ``Places of public accommodation located in private 
residences.'' The paragraph clarifies that the covered portion includes 
not only the space used as a commercial facility, but also the elements 
used to enter the commercial facility, e.g., the homeowner's front 
sidewalk, if any; the doorway; the hallways; the restroom, if used by 
employees or visitors of the commercial facility; and any other portion 
of the residence, interior or exterior, used by employees or visitors of 
the commercial facility.
    As in the case of public accommodations located in private 
residences, the new construction standards only apply to the extent that 
a portion of the residence is designed or intended for use as a 
commercial facility. Likewise, if a homeowner alters a portion of his 
home to convert it to a commercial facility, that work must be done in 
compliance with the alterations standards in appendix A.

                       Structural Impracticability

    Proposed Sec. 36.401(c) is included in the final rule with minor 
changes. It details a statutory exception to the new construction 
requirement: the requirement that new construction be accessible does 
not apply where

[[Page 729]]

an entity can demonstrate that it is structurally impracticable to meet 
the requirements of the regulation. This provision is also included in 
ADAAG, at section 4.1.1(5)(a).
    Consistent with the legislative history of the ADA, this narrow 
exception will apply only in rare and unusual circumstances where unique 
characteristics of terrain make accessibility unusually difficult. Such 
limitations for topographical problems are analogous to an acknowledged 
limitation in the application of the accessibility requirements of the 
Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA) of 1988.
    Almost all commenters supported this interpretation. Two commenters 
argued that the DOJ requirement is too limiting and would not exempt 
some buildings that should be exempted because of soil conditions, 
terrain, and other unusual site conditions. These commenters suggested 
consistency with HUD's Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines (56 FR 9472 
(1991)), which generally would allow exceptions from accessibility 
requirements, or allow compliance with less stringent requirements, on 
sites with slopes exceeding 10%.
    The Department is aware of the provisions in HUD's guidelines, which 
were issued on March 6, 1991, after passage of the ADA and publication 
of the Department's proposed rule. The approach taken in these 
guidelines, which apply to different types of construction and implement 
different statutory requirements for new construction, does not bind 
this Department in regulating under the ADA. The Department has included 
in the final rule the substance of the proposed provision, which is 
faithful to the intent of the statute, as expressed in the legislative 
history. (See Senate report at 70-71; Education and Labor report at 
120.)
    The limited structural impracticability exception means that it is 
acceptable to deviate from accessibility requirements only where unique 
characteristics of terrain prevent the incorporation of accessibility 
features and where providing accessibility would destroy the physical 
integrity of a facility. A situation in which a building must be built 
on stilts because of its location in marshlands or over water is an 
example of one of the few situations in which the exception for 
structural impracticability would apply.
    This exception to accessibility requirements should not be applied 
to situations in which a facility is located in ``hilly'' terrain or on 
a plot of land upon which there are steep grades. In such circumstances, 
accessibility can be achieved without destroying the physical integrity 
of a structure, and is required in the construction of new facilities.
    Some commenters asked for clarification concerning when and how to 
apply the ADA rules or the Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines, 
especially when a facility may be subject to both because of mixed use. 
Guidance on this question is provided in the discussion of the 
definitions of place of public accommodation and commercial facility. 
With respect to the structural impracticability exception, a mixed-use 
facility could not take advantage of the Fair Housing exemption, to the 
extent that it is less stringent than the ADA exemption, except for 
those portions of the facility that are subject only to the Fair Housing 
Act.
    As explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, in those rare 
circumstances in which it is structurally impracticable to achieve full 
compliance with accessibility retirements under the ADA, places of 
public accommodation and commercial facilities should still be designed 
and constructed to incorporate accessibility features to the extent that 
the features are structurally practicable. The accessibility 
requirements should not be viewed as an all-or-nothing proposition in 
such circumstances.
    If it is structurally impracticable for a facility in its entirety 
to be readily accessible to and usable by people with disabilities, then 
those portions that can be made accessible should be made accessible. If 
a building cannot be constructed in compliance with the full range of 
accessibility requirements because of structural impracticability, then 
it should still incorporate those features that are structurally 
practicable. If it is structurally impracticable to make a particular 
facility accessible to persons who have particular types of 
disabilities, it is still appropriate to require it to be made 
accessible to persons with other types of disabilities. For example, a 
facility that is of necessity built on stilts and cannot be made 
accessible to persons who use wheelchairs because it is structurally 
impracticable to do so, must be made accessible for individuals with 
vision or hearing impairments or other kinds of disabilities.

                           Elevator Exemption

    Section 36.401(d) implements the ``elevator exemption'' for new 
construction in section 303(b) of the ADA. The elevator exemption is an 
exception to the general requirement that new facilities be readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. Generally, an 
elevator is the most common way to provide individuals who use 
wheelchairs ``ready access'' to floor levels above or below the ground 
floor of a multi-story building. Congress, however, chose not to require 
elevators in new small buildings, that is, those with less than three 
stories or less than 3,000 square feet per story. In buildings eligible 
for the exemption, therefore, ``ready access'' from the building 
entrance to a floor above

[[Page 730]]

or below the ground floor is not required, because the statute does not 
require that an elevator be installed in such buildings. The elevator 
exemption does not apply, however, to a facility housing a shopping 
center, a shopping mall, or the professional office of a health care 
provider, or other categories of facilities as determined by the 
Attorney General. For example, a new office building that will have only 
two stories, with no elevator planned, will not be required to have an 
elevator, even if each story has 20,000 square feet. In other words, 
having either less than 3000 square feet per story or less than three 
stories qualifies a facility for the exemption; it need not qualify for 
the exemption on both counts. Similarly, a facility that has five 
stories of 2800 square feet each qualifies for the exemption. If a 
facility has three or more stories at any point, it is not eligible for 
the elevator exemption unless all the stories are less than 3000 square 
feet.
    The terms ``shopping center or shopping mall'' and ``professional 
office of a health care provider'' are defined in this section. They are 
substantively identical to the definitions included in the proposed rule 
in Sec. 36.104, ``Definitions.'' They have been moved to this section 
because, as commenters pointed out, they are relevant only for the 
purposes of the elevator exemption, and inclusion in the general 
definitions section could give the incorrect impression that an office 
of a health care provider is not covered as a place of public 
accommodation under other sections of the rule, unless the office falls 
within the definition.
    For purposes of Sec. 36.401, a ``shopping center or shopping mall'' 
is (1) a building housing five or more sales or rental establishments, 
or (2) a series of buildings on a common site, either under common 
ownership or common control or developed either as one project or as a 
series of related projects, housing five or more sales or rental 
establishments. The term ``shopping center or shopping mall'' only 
includes floor levels containing at least one sales or rental 
establishment, or any floor level that was designed or intended for use 
by at least one sales or rental establishment.
    Any sales or rental establishment of the type that is included in 
paragraph (5) of the definition of ``place of public accommodation'' 
(for example, a bakery, grocery store, clothing store, or hardware 
store) is considered a sales or rental establishment for purposes of 
this definition; the other types of public accommodations (e.g., 
restaurants, laundromats, banks, travel services, health spas) are not.
    In the preamble to the proposed rule, the Department sought comment 
on whether the definition of ``shopping center or mall'' should be 
expanded to include any of these other types of public accommodations. 
The Department also sought comment on whether a series of buildings 
should fall within the definition only if they are physically connected.
    Most of those responding to the first question (overwhelmingly 
groups representing people with disabilities, or individual commenters) 
urged that the definition encompass more places of public accommodation, 
such as restaurants, motion picture houses, laundromats, dry cleaners, 
and banks. They pointed out that often it is not known what types of 
establishments will be tenants in a new facility. In addition, they 
noted that malls are advertised as entities, that their appeal is in the 
``package'' of services offered to the public, and that this package 
often includes the additional types of establishments mentioned.
    Commenters representing business groups sought to exempt banks, 
travel services, grocery stores, drug stores, and freestanding retail 
stores from the elevator requirement. They based this request on the 
desire to continue the practice in some locations of incorporating 
mezzanines housing administrative offices, raised pharmacist areas, and 
raised areas in the front of supermarkets that house safes and are used 
by managers to oversee operations of check-out aisles and other 
functions. Many of these concerns are adequately addressed by ADAAG. 
Apart from those addressed by ADAAG, the Department sees no reason to 
treat a particular type of sales or rental establishment differently 
from any other. Although banks and travel services are not included as 
``sales or rental establishments,'' because they do not fall under 
paragraph (5) of the definition of place of public accommodation, 
grocery stores and drug stores are included.
    The Department has declined to include places of public 
accommodation other than sales or rental establishments in the 
definition. The statutory definition of ``public accommodation'' 
(section 301(7)) lists 12 types of establishments that are considered 
public accommodations. Category (E) includes ``a bakery, grocery store, 
clothing store, hardware store, shopping center, or other sales or 
rental establishment.'' This arrangement suggests that it is only these 
types of establishments that would make up a shopping center for 
purposes of the statute. To include all types of places of public 
accommodation, or those from 6 or 7 of the categories, as commenters 
suggest, would overly limit the elevator exemption; the universe of 
facilities covered by the definition of ``shopping center'' could well 
exceed the number of multitenant facilities not covered, which would 
render the exemption almost meaningless.
    For similar reasons, the Department is retaining the requirement 
that a building or series of buildings must house five or more sales or 
rental establishments before it falls within the definition of 
``shopping center.''

[[Page 731]]

Numerous commenters objected to the number and requested that the number 
be lowered from five to three or four. Lowering the number in this 
manner would include an inordinately large number of two-story 
multitenant buildings within the category of those required to have 
elevators.
    The responses to the question concerning whether a series of 
buildings should be connected in order to be covered were varied. 
Generally, disability rights groups and some government agencies said a 
series of buildings should not have to be connected, and pointed to a 
trend in some areas to build shopping centers in a garden or village 
setting. The Department agrees that this design choice should not negate 
the elevator requirement for new construction. Some business groups 
answered the question in the affirmative, and some suggested a different 
definition of shopping center. For example, one commenter recommended 
the addition of a requirement that the five or more establishments be 
physically connected on the non-ground floors by a common pedestrian 
walkway or pathway, because otherwise a series of stand-alone facilities 
would have to comply with the elevator requirement, which would be 
unduly burdensome and perhaps infeasible. Another suggested use of what 
it characterized as the standard industry definition: ``A group of 
retail stores and related business facilities, the whole planned, 
developed, operated and managed as a unit.'' While the rule's definition 
would reach a series of related projects that are under common control 
but were not developed as a single project, the Department considers 
such a facility to be a shopping center within the meaning of the 
statute. However, in light of the hardship that could confront a series 
of existing small stand-alone buildings if elevators were required in 
alterations, the Department has included a common access route in the 
definition of shopping center or shopping mall for purposes of Sec. 
36.404.
    Some commenters suggested that access to restrooms and other shared 
facilities open to the public should be required even if those 
facilities were not on a shopping floor. Such a provision with respect 
to toilet or bathing facilities is included in the elevator exception in 
final ADAAG 4.1.3(5).
    For purposes of this subpart, the rule does not distinguish between 
a ``shopping mall'' (usually a building with a roofed-over common 
pedestrian area serving more than one tenant in which a majority of the 
tenants have a main entrance from the common pedestrian area) and a 
``shopping center'' (e.g., a ``shopping strip''). Any facility housing 
five or more of the types of sales or rental establishments described, 
regardless of the number of other types of places of public 
accommodation housed there (e.g., offices, movie theatres, restaurants), 
is a shopping center or shopping mall.
    For example, a two-story facility built for mixed-use occupancy on 
both floors (e.g., by sales and rental establishments, a movie theater, 
restaurants, and general office space) is a shopping center or shopping 
mall if it houses five or more sales or rental establishments. If none 
of these establishments is located on the second floor, then only the 
ground floor, which contains the sales or rental establishments, would 
be a ``shopping center or shopping mall,'' unless the second floor was 
designed or intended for use by at least one sales or rental 
establishment. In determining whether a floor was intended for such use, 
factors to be considered include the types of establishments that first 
occupied the floor, the nature of the developer's marketing strategy, 
i.e., what types of establishments were sought, and inclusion of any 
design features particular to rental and sales establishments.
    A ``professional office of a health care provider'' is defined as a 
location where a person or entity regulated by a State to provide 
professional services related to the physical or mental health of an 
individual makes such services available to the public. In a two-story 
development that houses health care providers only on the ground floor, 
the ``professional office of a health care provider'' is limited to the 
ground floor unless the second floor was designed or intended for use by 
a health care provider. In determining if a floor was intended for such 
use, factors to be considered include whether the facility was 
constructed with special plumbing, electrical, or other features needed 
by health care providers, whether the developer marketed the facility as 
a medical office center, and whether any of the establishments that 
first occupied the floor was, in fact, a health care provider.
    In addition to requiring that a building that is a shopping center, 
shopping mall, or the professional office of a health care provider have 
an elevator regardless of square footage or number of floors, the ADA 
(section 303(b)) provides that the Attorney General may determine that a 
particular category of facilities requires the installation of elevators 
based on the usage of the facilities. The Department, as it proposed to 
do, has added to the nonexempt categories terminals, depots, or other 
stations used for specified public transportation, and airport passenger 
terminals. Numerous commenters in all categories endorsed this proposal; 
none opposed it. It is not uncommon for an airport passenger terminal or 
train station, for example, to have only two floors, with gates on both 
floors. Because of the significance of transportation, because a person 
with disabilities could be arriving or departing at any gate, and 
because inaccessible facilities could result in a total denial of 
transportation services, it is reasonable to require that newly 
constructed transit facilities be

[[Page 732]]

accessible, regardless of square footage or number of floors. One 
comment suggested an amendment that would treat terminals and stations 
similarly to shopping centers, by requiring an accessible route only to 
those areas used for passenger loading and unloading and for other 
passenger services. Paragraph (d)(2)(ii) has been modified accordingly.
    Some commenters suggested that other types of facilities (e.g., 
educational facilities, libraries, museums, commercial facilities, and 
social service facilities) should be included in the category of 
nonexempt facilities. The Department has not found adequate 
justification for including any other types of facilities in the 
nonexempt category at this time.
    Section 36.401(d)(2) establishes the operative requirements 
concerning the elevator exemption and its application to shopping 
centers and malls, professional offices of health care providers, 
transit stations, and airport passenger terminals. Under the rule's 
framework, it is necessary first to determine if a new facility 
(including one or more buildings) houses places of public accommodation 
or commercial facilities that are in the categories for which elevators 
are required. If so, and the facility is a shopping center or shopping 
mall, or a professional office of a health care provider, then any area 
housing such an office or a sales or rental establishment or the 
professional office of a health care provider is not entitled to the 
elevator exemption.
    The following examples illustrate the application of these 
principles:
    1. A shopping mall has an upper and a lower level. There are two 
``anchor stores'' (in this case, major department stores at either end 
of the mall, both with exterior entrances and an entrance on each level 
from the common area). In addition, there are 30 stores (sales or rental 
establishments) on the upper level, all of which have entrances from a 
common central area. There are 30 stores on the lower level, all of 
which have entrances from a common central area. According to the rule, 
elevator access must be provided to each store and to each level of the 
anchor stores. This requirement could be satisfied with respect to the 
60 stores through elevators connecting the two pedestrian levels, 
provided that an individual could travel from the elevator to any other 
point on that level (i.e., into any store through a common pedestrian 
area) on an accessible path.
    2. A commercial (nonresidential) ``townhouse'' development is 
composed of 20 two-story attached buildings. The facility is developed 
as one project, with common ownership, and the space will be leased to 
retailers. Each building has one accessible entrance from a pedestrian 
walk to the first floor. From that point, one can enter a store on the 
first floor, or walk up a flight of stairs to a store on the second 
floor. All 40 stores must be accessible at ground floor level or by 
accessible vertical access from that level. This does not mean, however, 
that 20 elevators must be installed. Access could be provided to the 
second floor by an elevator from the pedestrian area on the lower level 
to an upper walkway connecting all the areas on the second floor.
    3. In the same type of development, it is planned that retail stores 
will be housed exclusively on the ground floor, with only office space 
(not professional offices of health care providers) on the second. 
Elevator access need not be provided to the second floor because all the 
sales or rental establishments (the entities that make the facility a 
shopping center) are located on an accessible ground floor.
    4. In the same type of development, the space is designed and 
marketed as medical or office suites, or as a medical office facility. 
Accessible vertical access must be provided to all areas, as described 
in example 2.
    Some commenters suggested that building owners who knowingly lease 
or rent space to nonexempt places of public accommodation would violate 
Sec. 36.401. However, the Department does not consider leasing or 
renting inaccessible space in itself to constitute a violation of this 
part. Nor does a change in use of a facility, with no accompanying 
alterations (e.g., if a psychiatrist replaces an attorney as a tenant in 
a second-floor office, but no alterations are made to the office) 
trigger accessibility requirements.
    Entities cannot evade the requirements of this section by 
constructing facilities in such a way that no story is intended to 
constitute a ``ground floor.'' For example, if a private entity 
constructs a building whose main entrance leads only to stairways or 
escalators that connect with upper or lower floors, the Department would 
consider at least one level of the facility a ground story.
    The rule requires in Sec. 36.401(d)(3), consistent with the 
proposed rule, that, even if a building falls within the elevator 
exemption, the floor or floors other than the ground floor must 
nonetheless be accessible, except for elevator access, to individuals 
with disabilities, including people who use wheelchairs. This 
requirement applies to buildings that do not house sales or rental 
establishments or the professional offices of a health care provider as 
well as to those in which such establishments or offices are all located 
on the ground floor. In such a situation, little added cost is entailed 
in making the second floor accessible, because it is similar in 
structure and floor plan to the ground floor.
    There are several reasons for this provision. First, some 
individuals who are mobility impaired may work on a building's second 
floor, which they can reach by stairs and

[[Page 733]]

the use of crutches; however, the same individuals, once they reach the 
second floor, may then use a wheelchair that is kept in the office. 
Secondly, because the first floor will be accessible, there will be 
little additional cost entailed in making the second floor, with the 
same structure and generally the same floor plan, accessible. In 
addition, the second floor must be accessible to those persons with 
disabilities who do not need elevators for level changes (for example, 
persons with sight or hearing impairments and those with certain 
mobility impairments). Finally, if an elevator is installed in the 
future for any reason, full access to the floor will be facilitated.
    One commenter asserted that this provision goes beyond the 
Department's authority under the Act, and disagreed with the 
Department's claim that little additional cost would be entailed in 
compliance. However, the provision is taken directly from the 
legislative history (see Education and Labor report at 114).
    One commenter said that where an elevator is not required, platform 
lifts should be required. Two commenters pointed out that the elevator 
exemption is really an exemption from the requirement for providing an 
accessible route to a second floor not served by an elevator. The 
Department agrees with the latter comment. Lifts to provide access 
between floors are not required in buildings that are not required to 
have elevators. This point is specifically addressed in the appendix to 
ADAAG (Sec. 4.1.3(5)). ADAAG also addresses in detail the situations in 
which lifts are permitted or required.

                       Section 36.402 Alterations

    Sections 36.402-36.405 implement section 303(a)(2) of the Act, which 
requires that alterations to existing facilities be made in a way that 
ensures that the altered portion is readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with disabilities. This part does not require alterations; 
it simply provides that when alterations are undertaken, they must be 
made in a manner that provides access.
    Section 36.402(a)(1) provides that any alteration to a place of 
public accommodation or a commercial facility, after January 26, 1992, 
shall be made so as to ensure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the 
altered portions of the facility are readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use 
wheelchairs.
    The proposed rule provided that an alteration would be deemed to be 
undertaken after January 26, 1992, if the physical alteration of the 
property is in progress after that date. Commenters pointed out that 
this provision would, in some cases, produce an unjust result by 
requiring the redesign or retrofitting of projects initiated before this 
part established the ADA accessibility standards. The Department agrees 
that the proposed rule would, in some instances, unfairly penalize 
projects that were substantially completed before the effective date. 
Therefore, paragraph (a)(2) has been revised to specify that an 
alteration will be deemed to be undertaken after January 26, 1992, if 
the physical alteration of the property begins after that date. As a 
matter of interpretation, the Department will construe this provision to 
apply to alterations that require a permit from a State, County or local 
government, if physical alterations pursuant to the terms of the permit 
begin after January 26, 1992. The Department recognizes that this 
application of the effective date may require redesign of some 
facilities that were planned prior to the publication of this part, but 
no retrofitting will be required of facilities on which the physical 
alterations were initiated prior to the effective date of the Act. Of 
course, nothing in this section in any way alters the obligation of any 
facility to remove architectural barriers in existing facilities to the 
extent that such barrier removal is readily achievable.
    Paragraph (b) provides that, for the purposes of this part, an 
``alteration'' is a change to a place of public accommodation or a 
commercial facility that affects or could affect the usability of the 
building or facility or any part thereof. One commenter suggested that 
the concept of usability should apply only to those changes that affect 
access by persons with disabilities. The Department remains convinced 
that the Act requires the concept of ``usability'' to be read broadly to 
include any change that affects the usability of the facility, not 
simply changes that relate directly to access by individuals with 
disabilities.
    The Department received a significant number of comments on the 
examples provided in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the proposed rule. 
Some commenters urged the Department to limit the application of this 
provision to major structural modifications, while others asserted that 
it should be expanded to include cosmetic changes such as painting and 
wallpapering. The Department believes that neither approach is 
consistent with the legislative history, which requires this 
Department's regulation to be consistent with the accessibility 
guidelines (ADAAG) developed by the Architectural and Transportation 
Barriers Compliance Board (ATBCB). Although the legislative history 
contemplates that, in some instances, the ADA accessibility standards 
will exceed the current MGRAD requirements, it also clearly indicates 
the view of the drafters that ``minor changes such as painting or 
papering walls * * * do not affect usability'' (Education and Labor 
report at 111, Judiciary report at 64), and, therefore, are not 
alterations. The proposed rule was based on the existing MGRAD 
definition of ``alteration.''

[[Page 734]]

The language of the final rule has been revised to be consistent with 
ADAAG, incorporated as appendix A to this part.
    Some commenters sought clarification of the intended scope of this 
section. The proposed rule contained illustrations of changes that 
affect usability and those that do not. The intent of the illustrations 
was to explain the scope of the alterations requirement; the effect was 
to obscure it. As a result of the illustrations, some commenters 
concluded that any alteration to a facility, even a minor alteration 
such as relocating an electrical outlet, would trigger an extensive 
obligation to provide access throughout an entire facility. That result 
was never contemplated.
    Therefore, in this final rule paragraph (b)(1) has been revised to 
include the major provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the 
proposed rule. The examples in the proposed rule have been deleted. 
Paragraph (b)(1) now provides that alterations include, but are not 
limited to, remodeling, renovation, rehabilitation, reconstruction, 
historic restoration, changes or rearrangement in structural parts or 
elements, and changes or rearrangement in the plan configuration of 
walls and full-height partitions. Normal maintenance, reroofing, 
painting or wallpapering, asbestos removal, or changes to mechanical and 
electrical systems are not alterations unless they affect the usability 
of building or facility.
    Paragraph (b)(2) of this final rule was added to clarify the scope 
of the alterations requirement. Paragraph (b)(2) provides that if 
existing elements, spaces, or common areas are altered, then each such 
altered element, space, or area shall comply with the applicable 
provisions of appendix A (ADAAG). As provided in Sec. 36.403, if an 
altered space or area is an area of the facility that contains a primary 
function, then the requirements of that section apply.
    Therefore, when an entity undertakes a minor alteration to a place 
of public accommodation or commercial facility, such as moving an 
electrical outlet, the new outlet must be installed in compliance with 
ADAAG. (Alteration of the elements listed in Sec. 36.403(c)(2) cannot 
trigger a path of travel obligation.) If the alteration is to an area, 
such as an employee lounge or locker room, that is not an area of the 
facility that contains a primary function, that area must comply with 
ADAAG. It is only when an alteration affects access to or usability of 
an area containing a primary function, as opposed to other areas or the 
elements listed in Sec. 36.403(c)(2), that the path of travel to the 
altered area must be made accessible.
    The Department received relatively few comments on paragraph (c), 
which explains the statutory phrase ``to the maximum extent feasible.'' 
Some commenters suggested that the regulation should specify that cost 
is a factor in determining whether it is feasible to make an altered 
area accessible. The legislative history of the ADA indicates that the 
concept of feasibility only reaches the question of whether it is 
possible to make the alteration accessible in compliance with this part. 
Costs are to be considered only when an alteration to an area containing 
a primary function triggers an additional requirement to make the path 
of travel to the altered area accessible.
    Section 36.402(c) is, therefore, essentially unchanged from the 
proposed rule. At the recommendation of a commenter, the Department has 
inserted the word ``virtually'' to modify ``impossible'' to conform to 
the language of the legislative history. It explains that the phrase 
``to the maximum extent feasible'' as used in this section applies to 
the occasional case where the nature of an existing facility makes it 
virtually impossible to comply fully with applicable accessibility 
standards through a planned alteration. In the occasional cases in which 
full compliance is impossible, alterations shall provide the maximum 
physical accessibility feasible. Any features of the facility that are 
being altered shall be made accessible unless it is technically 
infeasible to do so. If providing accessibility in conformance with this 
section to individuals with certain disabilities (e.g., those who use 
wheelchairs) would not be feasible, the facility shall be made 
accessible to persons with other types of disabilities (e.g., those who 
use crutches or who have impaired vision or hearing, or those who have 
other types of impairments).

               Section 36.403 Alterations: Path of Travel

    Section 36.403 implements the statutory requirement that any 
alteration that affects or could affect the usability of or access to an 
area of a facility that contains a primary function shall be made so as 
to ensure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the path of travel to 
the altered area, and the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains 
serving the altered area, are readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use 
wheelchairs, unless the cost and scope of such alterations is 
disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration. Paragraph (a) 
restates this statutory requirement.
    Paragraph (b) defines a ``primary function'' as a major activity for 
which the facility is intended. This paragraph is unchanged from the 
proposed rule. Areas that contain a primary function include, but are 
not limited to, the customer services lobby of a bank, the dining area 
of a cafeteria, the meeting rooms in a conference center, as well as 
offices and all other work areas in which the activities of the public 
accommodation or other private entities using the facility are

[[Page 735]]

carried out. The concept of ``areas containing a primary function'' is 
analogous to the concept of ``functional spaces'' in Sec. 3.5 of the 
existing Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards, which defines 
``functional spaces'' as ``[t]he rooms and spaces in a building or 
facility that house the major activities for which the building or 
facility is intended.''
    Paragraph (b) provides that areas such as mechanical rooms, boiler 
rooms, supply storage rooms, employee lounges and locker rooms, 
janitorial closets, entrances, corridors, and restrooms are not areas 
containing a primary function. There may be exceptions to this general 
rule. For example, the availability of public restrooms at a place of 
public accommodation at a roadside rest stop may be a major factor 
affecting customers' decisions to patronize the public accommodation. In 
that case, a restroom would be considered to be an ``area containing a 
primary function'' of the facility.
    Most of the commenters who addressed this issue supported the 
approach taken by the Department; but a few commenters suggested that 
areas not open to the general public or those used exclusively by 
employees should be excluded from the definition of primary function. 
The preamble to the proposed rule noted that the Department considered 
an alternative approach to the definition of ``primary function,'' under 
which a primary function of a commercial facility would be defined as a 
major activity for which the facility was intended, while a primary 
function of a place of public accommodation would be defined as an 
activity which involves providing significant goods, services, 
facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations. However, the 
Department concluded that, although portions of the legislative history 
of the ADA support this alternative, the better view is that the 
language now contained in Sec. 36.403(b) most accurately reflects 
congressional intent. No commenter made a persuasive argument that the 
Department's interpretation of the legislative history is incorrect.
    When the ADA was introduced, the requirement to make alterations 
accessible was included in section 302 of the Act, which identifies the 
practices that constitute discrimination by a public accommodation. 
Because section 302 applies only to the operation of a place of public 
accommodation, the alterations requirement was intended only to provide 
access to clients and customers of a public accommodation. It was 
anticipated that access would be provided to employees with disabilities 
under the ``reasonable accommodation'' requirements of title I. However, 
during its consideration of the ADA, the House Judiciary Committee 
amended the bill to move the alterations provision from section 302 to 
section 303, which applies to commercial facilities as well as public 
accommodations. The Committee report accompanying the bill explains 
that:
    New construction and alterations of both public accommodations and 
commercial facilities must be made readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with disabilities * * *. Essentially, [this requirement] is 
designed to ensure that patrons and employees of public accommodations 
and commercial facilities are able to get to, enter and use the facility 
* * *. The rationale for making new construction accessible applies with 
equal force to alterations.
Judiciary report at 62-63 (emphasis added).
    The ADA, as enacted, contains the language of section 303 as it was 
reported out of the Judiciary Committee. Therefore, the Department has 
concluded that the concept of ``primary function'' should be applied in 
the same manner to places of public accommodation and to commercial 
facilities, thereby including employee work areas in places of public 
accommodation within the scope of this section.
    Paragraph (c) provides examples of alterations that affect the 
usability of or access to an area containing a primary function. The 
examples include: Remodeling a merchandise display area or employee work 
areas in a department store; installing a new floor surface to replace 
an inaccessible surface in the customer service area or employee work 
areas of a bank; redesigning the assembly line area of a factory; and 
installing a computer center in an accounting firm. This list is 
illustrative, not exhaustive. Any change that affects the usability of 
or access to an area containing a primary function triggers the 
statutory obligation to make the path of travel to the altered area 
accessible.
    When the proposed rule was drafted, the Department believed that the 
rule made it clear that the ADA would require alterations to the path of 
travel only when such alterations are not disproportionate to the 
alteration to the primary function area. However, the comments that the 
Department received indicated that many commenters believe that even 
minor alterations to individual elements would require additional 
alterations to the path of travel. To address the concern of these 
commenters, a new paragraph (c)(2) has been added to the final rule to 
provide that alterations to such elements as windows, hardware, controls 
(e.g. light switches or thermostats), electrical outlets, or signage 
will not be deemed to be alterations that affect the usability of or 
access to an area containing a primary function. Of course, each element 
that is altered must comply with ADAAG (appendix A) . The cost of 
alterations to individual elements would be included in the overall cost 
of an alteration for purposes of determining disproportionality and 
would be counted

[[Page 736]]

when determining the aggregate cost of a series of small alterations in 
accordance with Sec. 36.401(h) if the area is altered in a manner that 
affects access to or usability of an area containing a primary function.
    Paragraph (d) concerns the respective obligations of landlords and 
tenants in the cases of alterations that trigger the path of travel 
requirement under Sec. 36.403. This paragraph was contained in the 
landlord/tenant section of the proposed rule, Sec. 36.201(b). If a 
tenant is making alterations upon its premises pursuant to terms of a 
lease that grant it the authority to do so (even if they constitute 
alterations that trigger the path of travel requirement), and the 
landlord is not making alterations to other parts of the facility, then 
the alterations by the tenant on its own premises do not trigger a path 
of travel obligation upon the landlord in areas of the facility under 
the landlord's authority that are not otherwise being altered. The 
legislative history makes clear that the path of travel requirement 
applies only to the entity that is already making the alteration, and 
thus the Department has not changed the final rule despite numerous 
comments suggesting that the tenant be required to provide a path of 
travel.
    Paragraph (e) defines a ``path of travel'' as a continuous, 
unobstructed way of pedestrian passage by means of which an altered area 
may be approached, entered, and exited; and which connects the altered 
area with an exterior approach (including sidewalks, streets, and 
parking areas), an entrance to the facility, and other parts of the 
facility. This concept of an accessible path of travel is analogous to 
the concepts of ``accessible route'' and ``circulation path'' contained 
in section 3.5 of the current UFAS. Some commenters suggested that this 
paragraph should address emergency egress. The Department disagrees. 
``Path of travel'' as it is used in this section is a term of art under 
the ADA that relates only to the obligation of the public accommodation 
or commercial facility to provide additional accessible elements when an 
area containing a primary function is altered. The Department recognizes 
that emergency egress is an important issue, but believes that it is 
appropriately addressed in ADAAG (appendix A), not in this paragraph. 
Furthermore, ADAAG does not require changes to emergency egress areas in 
alterations.
    Paragraph (e)(2) is drawn from section 3.5 of UFAS. It provides that 
an accessible path of travel may consist of walks and sidewalks, curb 
ramps and other interior or exterior pedestrian ramps; clear floor paths 
through lobbies, corridors, rooms, and other improved areas; parking 
access aisles; elevators and lifts; or a combination of such elements. 
Paragraph (e)(3) provides that, for the purposes of this part, the term 
``path of travel'' also includes the restrooms, telephones, and drinking 
fountains serving an altered area.
    Although the Act establishes an expectation that an accessible path 
of travel should generally be included when alterations are made to an 
area containing a primary function, Congress recognized that, in some 
circumstances, providing an accessible path of travel to an altered area 
may be sufficiently burdensome in comparison to the alteration being 
undertaken to the area containing a primary function as to render this 
requirement unreasonable. Therefore, Congress provided, in section 
303(a)(2) of the Act, that alterations to the path of travel that are 
disproportionate in cost and scope to the overall alteration are not 
required.
    The Act requires the Attorney General to determine at what point the 
cost of providing an accessible path of travel becomes disproportionate. 
The proposed rule provided three options for making this determination.
    Two committees of Congress specifically addressed this issue: the 
House Committee on Education and Labor and the House Committee on the 
Judiciary. The reports issued by each committee suggested that 
accessibility alterations to a path of travel might be 
``disproportionate'' if they exceed 30% of the alteration costs 
(Education and Labor report at 113; Judiciary report at 64). Because the 
Department believed that smaller percentage rates might be appropriate, 
the proposed rule sought comments on three options: 10%, 20%, or 30%.
    The Department received a significant number of comments on this 
section. Commenters representing individuals with disabilities generally 
supported the use of 30% (or more); commenters representing covered 
entities supported a figure of 10% (or less). The Department believes 
that alterations made to provide an accessible path of travel to the 
altered area should be deemed disproportionate to the overall alteration 
when the cost exceeds 20% of the cost of the alteration to the primary 
function area. This approach appropriately reflects the intent of 
Congress to provide access for individuals with disabilities without 
causing economic hardship for the covered public accommodations and 
commercial facilities.
    The Department has determined that the basis for this cost 
calculation shall be the cost of the alterations to the area containing 
the primary function. This approach will enable the public accommodation 
or other private entity that is making the alteration to calculate its 
obligation as a percentage of a clearly ascertainable base cost, rather 
than as a percentage of the ``total'' cost, an amount that will change 
as accessibility alterations to the path of travel are made.

[[Page 737]]

    Paragraph (f)(2) (paragraph (e)(2) in the proposed rule) is 
unchanged. It provides examples of costs that may be counted as 
expenditures required to provide an accessible path of travel. They 
include:
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Costs associated with providing an accessible 
entrance and an accessible route to the altered area, for example, the 
cost of widening doorways or installing ramps;
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Costs associated with making restrooms 
accessible, such as installing grab bars, enlarging toilet stalls, 
insulating pipes, or installing accessible faucet controls;
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Costs associated with providing accessible 
telephones, such as relocating telephones to an accessible height, 
installing amplification devices, or installing telecommunications 
devices for deaf persons (TDD's);
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Costs associated with relocating an inaccessible 
drinking fountain.
    Paragraph (f)(1) of the proposed rule provided that when the cost of 
alterations necessary to make the path of travel serving an altered area 
fully accessible is disproportionate to the cost of the overall 
alteration, the path of travel shall be made accessible to the maximum 
extent feasible. In response to the suggestion of a commenter, the 
Department has made an editorial change in the final rule (paragraph 
(g)(1)) to clarify that if the cost of providing a fully accessible path 
of travel is disproportionate, the path of travel shall be made 
accessible ``to the extent that it can be made accessible without 
incurring disproportionate costs.''
    Paragraph (g)(2) (paragraph (f)(2) in the NPRM) establishes that 
priority should be given to those elements that will provide the 
greatest access, in the following order: An accessible entrance; an 
accessible route to the altered area; at least one accessible restroom 
for each sex or a single unisex restroom; accessible telephones; 
accessible drinking fountains; and, whenever possible, additional 
accessible elements such as parking, storage, and alarms. This paragraph 
is unchanged from the proposed rule.
    Paragraph (h) (paragraph (g) in the proposed rule) provides that the 
obligation to provide an accessible path of travel may not be evaded by 
performing a series of small alterations to the area served by a single 
path of travel if those alterations could have been performed as a 
single undertaking. If an area containing a primary function has been 
altered without providing an accessible path of travel to serve that 
area, and subsequent alterations of that area, or a different area on 
the same path of travel, are undertaken within three years of the 
original alteration, the total cost of alterations to primary function 
areas on that path of travel during the preceding three year period 
shall be considered in determining whether the cost of making the path 
of travel serving that area accessible is disproportionate. Only 
alterations undertaken after January 26, 1992, shall be considered in 
determining if the cost of providing accessible features is 
disproportionate to the overall cost of the alterations.

             Section 36.404 Alterations: Elevator Exemption

    Section 36.404 implements the elevator exemption in section 303(b) 
of the Act as it applies to altered facilities. The provisions of 
section 303(b) are discussed in the preamble to Sec. 36.401(d) above. 
The statute applies the same exemption to both new construction and 
alterations. The principal difference between the requirements of Sec. 
36.401(d) and Sec. 36.404 is that, in altering an existing facility 
that is not eligible for the statutory exemption, the public 
accommodation or other private entity responsible for the alteration is 
not required to install an elevator if the installation of an elevator 
would be disproportionate in cost and scope to the cost of the overall 
alteration as provided in Sec. 36.403(f)(1). In addition, the standards 
referenced in Sec. 36.406 (ADAAG) provide that installation of an 
elevator in an altered facility is not required if it is ``technically 
infeasible.''
    This section has been revised to define the terms ``professional 
office of a health care provider'' and ``shopping center or shopping 
mall'' for the purposes of this section. The definition of 
``professional office of a health care provider'' is identical to the 
definition included in Sec. 36.401(d).
    It has been brought to the attention of the Department that there is 
some misunderstanding about the scope of the elevator exemption as it 
applies to the professional office of a health care provider. A public 
accommodation, such as the professional office of a health care 
provider, is required to remove architectural barriers to its facility 
to the extent that such barrier removal is readily achievable (see Sec. 
36.304), but it is not otherwise required by this part to undertake new 
construction or alterations. This part does not require that an existing 
two story building that houses the professional office of a health care 
provider be altered for the purpose of providing elevator access. If, 
however, alterations to the area housing the office of the health care 
provider are undertaken for other purposes, the installation of an 
elevator might be required, but only if the cost of the elevator is not 
disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration. Neither the Act 
nor this part prohibits a health care provider from locating his or her 
professional office in an existing facility that does not have an 
elevator.
    Because of the unique challenges presented in altering existing 
facilities, the Department has adopted a definition of ``shopping center 
or shopping mall'' for the purposes of this section that is slightly 
different from the definition adopted under Sec. 36.401(d). For

[[Page 738]]

the purposes of this section, a ``shopping center or shopping mall'' is 
(1) a building housing five or more sales or rental establishments, or 
(2) a series of buildings on a common site, connected by a common 
pedestrian access route above or below the ground floor, either under 
common ownership or common control or developed either as one project or 
as a series of related projects, housing five or more sales or rental 
establishments. As is the case with new construction, the term 
``shopping center or shopping mall'' only includes floor levels housing 
at least one sales or rental establishment, or any floor level that was 
designed or intended for use by at least one sales or rental 
establishment.
    The Department believes that it is appropriate to use a different 
definition of ``shopping center or shopping mall'' for this section than 
for Sec. 36.401, in order to make it clear that a series of existing 
buildings on a common site that is altered for the use of sales or 
rental establishments does not become a ``shopping center or shopping 
mall'' required to install an elevator, unless there is a common means 
of pedestrian access above or below the ground floor. Without this 
exemption, separate, but adjacent, buildings that were initially 
designed and constructed independently of each other could be required 
to be retrofitted with elevators, if they were later renovated for a 
purpose not contemplated at the time of construction.
    Like Sec. 36.401(d), Sec. 36.404 provides that the exemptions in 
this paragraph do not obviate or limit in any way the obligation to 
comply with the other accessibility requirements established in this 
subpart. For example, alterations to floors above or below the ground 
floor must be accessible regardless of whether the altered facility has 
an elevator. If a facility that is not required to install an elevator 
nonetheless has an elevator, that elevator shall meet, to the maximum 
extent feasible, the accessibility requirements of this section.

            Section 36.405 Alterations: Historic Preservation

    Section 36.405 gives effect to the intent of Congress, expressed in 
section 504(c) of the Act, that this part recognize the national 
interest in preserving significant historic structures. Commenters 
criticized the Department's use of descriptive terms in the proposed 
rule that are different from those used in the ADA to describe eligible 
historic properties. In addition, some commenters criticized the 
Department's decision to use the concept of ``substantially impairing'' 
the historic features of a property, which is a concept employed in 
regulations implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. 
Those commenters recommended that the Department adopt the criteria of 
``adverse effect'' published by the Advisory Council on Historic 
Preservation under the National Historic Preservation Act (36 CFR 800.9) 
as the standard for determining whether an historic property may be 
altered.
    The Department agrees with these comments to the extent that they 
suggest that the language of the rule should conform to the language 
employed by Congress in the ADA. Therefore, the language of this section 
has been revised to make it clear that this provision applies to 
buildings or facilities that are eligible for listing in the National 
Register of Historic Places under the National Historic Preservation Act 
(16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.) and to buildings or facilities that are 
designated as historic under State or local law. The Department 
believes, however, that the criteria of adverse effect employed under 
the National Historic Preservation Act are inappropriate for this rule 
because section 504(c) of the ADA specifies that special alterations 
provisions shall apply only when an alteration would ``threaten or 
destroy the historic significance of qualified historic buildings and 
facilities.''
    The Department intends that the exception created by this section be 
applied only in those very rare situations in which it is not possible 
to provide access to an historic property using the special access 
provisions in ADAAG. Therefore, paragraph (a) of Sec. 36.405 has been 
revised to provide that alterations to historic properties shall comply, 
to the maximum extent feasible, with section 4.1.7 of ADAAG. Paragraph 
(b) of this section has been revised to provide that if it has been 
determined, under the procedures established in ADAAG, that it is not 
feasible to provide physical access to an historic property that is a 
place of public accommodation in a manner that will not threaten or 
destroy the historic significance of the property, alternative methods 
of access shall be provided pursuant to the requirements of Subpart C.

      Section 36.406 Standards for New Construction and Alterations

    Section 36.406 implements the requirements of sections 306(b) and 
306(c) of the Act, which require the Attorney General to promulgate 
standards for accessible design for buildings and facilities subject to 
the Act and this part that are consistent with the supplemental minimum 
guidelines and requirements for accessible design published by the 
Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (ATBCB or 
Board) pursuant to section 504 of the Act. This section of the rule 
provides that new construction and alterations subject to this part 
shall comply with the standards for accessible design published as 
appendix A to this part.
    Appendix A contains the Americans with Disabilities Act 
Accessibility Guidelines for

[[Page 739]]

Buildings and Facilities (ADAAG) which is being published by the ATBCB 
as a final rule elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register. As 
proposed in this Department's proposed rule, Sec. 36.406(a) adopts 
ADAAG as the accessibility standard applicable under this rule.
    Paragraph (b) was not included in the proposed rule. It provides, in 
chart form, guidance for using ADAAG together with subparts A through D 
of this part when determining requirements for a particular facility. 
This chart is intended solely as guidance for the user; it has no effect 
for purposes of compliance or enforcement. It does not necessarily 
provide complete or mandatory information.
    Proposed Sec. 36.406(b) is not included in the final rule. That 
provision, which would have taken effect only if the final rule had 
followed the proposed Option Two for Sec. 36.401(a), is unnecessary 
because the Department has chosen Option One, as explained in the 
preamble for that section.
    Section 504(a) of the ADA requires the ATBCB to issue minimum 
guidelines to supplement the existing Minimum Guidelines and 
Requirements for Accessible Design (MGRAD) (36 CFR part 1190) for 
purposes of title III. According to section 504(b) of the Act, the 
guidelines are to establish additional requirements, consistent with the 
Act, ``to ensure that buildings and facilities are accessible, in terms 
of architecture and design, . . . and communication, to individuals with 
disabilities.'' Section 306(c) of the Act requires that the 
accessibility standards included in the Department's regulations be 
consistent with the minimum guidelines, in this case ADAAG.
    As explained in the ATBCB's preamble to ADAAG, the substance and 
form of the guidelines are drawn from several sources. They use as their 
model the 1984 Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) (41 CFR 
part 101, subpart 101-19.6, appendix), which are the standards 
implementing the Architectural Barriers Act. UFAS is based on the 
Board's 1982 MGRAD. ADAAG follows the numbering system and format of the 
private sector American National Standard Institute's ANSI A117.1 
standards. (American National Specifications for Making Buildings and 
Facilities Accessible to and Usable by Physically Handicapped People 
(ANSI A117-1980) and American National Standard for Buildings and 
Facilities--Providing Accessibility and Usability for Physically 
Handicapped People (ANSI A117.1-1986).) ADAAG supplements MGRAD. In 
developing ADAAG, the Board made every effort to be consistent with 
MGRAD and the current and proposed ANSI Standards, to the extent 
consistent with the ADA.
    ADAAG consists of nine main sections and a separate appendix. 
Sections 1 through 3 contain general provisions and definitions. Section 
4 contains scoping provisions and technical specifications applicable to 
all covered buildings and facilities. The scoping provisions are listed 
separately for new construction of sites and exterior facilities; new 
construction of buildings; additions; alterations; and alterations to 
historic properties. The technical specifications generally reprint the 
text and illustrations of the ANSI A117.1 standard, except where 
differences are noted by italics. Sections 5 through 9 of the guidelines 
are special application sections and contain additional requirements for 
restaurants and cafeterias, medical care facilities, business and 
mercantile facilities, libraries, and transient lodging. The appendix to 
the guidelines contains additional information to aid in understanding 
the technical specifications. The section numbers in the appendix 
correspond to the sections of the guidelines to which they relate. An 
asterisk after a section number indicates that additional information 
appears in the appendix.
    ADAAG's provisions are further explained under Summary of ADAAG 
below.

                            General Comments

    One commenter urged the Department to move all or portions of 
subpart D, New Construction and Alterations, to the appendix (ADAAG) or 
to duplicate portions of subpart D in the appendix. The commenter 
correctly pointed out that subpart D is inherently linked to ADAAG, and 
that a self-contained set of rules would be helpful to users. The 
Department has attempted to simplify use of the two documents by 
deleting some paragraphs from subpart D (e.g., those relating to work 
areas), because they are included in ADAAG. However, the Department has 
retained in subpart D those sections that are taken directly from the 
statute or that give meaning to specific statutory concepts (e.g., 
structural impracticability, path of travel). While some of the subpart 
D provisions are duplicated in ADAAG, others are not. For example, 
issues relating to path of travel and disproportionality in alterations 
are not addressed in detail in ADAAG. (The structure and contents of the 
two documents are addressed below under Summary of ADAAG.) While the 
Department agrees that it would be useful to have one self-contained 
document, the different focuses of this rule and ADAAG do not permit 
this result at this time. However, the chart included in Sec. 36.406(b) 
should assist users in applying the provisions of subparts A through D, 
and ADAAG together.
    Numerous business groups have urged the Department not to adopt the 
proposed ADAAG as the accessibility standards, because the requirements 
established are too high, reflect the ``state of the art,'' and are 
inflexible, rigid, and impractical. Many of these objections have been 
lodged on the

[[Page 740]]

basis that ADAAG exceeds the statutory mandate to establish ``minimum'' 
guidelines. In the view of the Department, these commenters have 
misconstrued the meaning of the term ``minimum guidelines.'' The statute 
clearly contemplates that the guidelines establish a level of access--a 
minimum--that the standards must meet or exceed. The guidelines are not 
to be ``minimal'' in the sense that they would provide for a low level 
of access. To the contrary, Congress emphasized that the ADA requires a 
``high degree of convenient access.'' Education and Labor report at 117-
18. The legislative history explains that the guidelines may not 
``reduce, weaken, narrow or set less accessibility standards than those 
included in existing MGRAD'' and should provide greater guidance in 
communication accessibility for individuals with hearing and vision 
impairments. Id. at 139. Nor did Congress contemplate a set of 
guidelines less detailed than ADAAG; the statute requires that the ADA 
guidelines supplement the existing MGRAD. When it established the 
statutory scheme, Congress was aware of the content and purpose of the 
1982 MGRAD; as ADAAG does with respect to ADA, MGRAD establishes a 
minimum level of access that the Architectural Barriers Act standards 
(i.e., UFAS) must meet or exceed, and includes a high level of detail.
    Many of the same commenters urged the Department to incorporate as 
its accessibility standards the ANSI standard's technical provisions and 
to adopt the proposed scoping provisions under development by the 
Council of American Building Officials' Board for the Coordination of 
Model Codes (BCMC). They contended that the ANSI standard is familiar to 
and accepted by professionals, and that both documents are developed 
through consensus. They suggested that ADAAG will not stay current, 
because it does not follow an established cyclical review process, and 
that it is not likely to be adopted by nonfederal jurisdictions in State 
and local codes. They urged the Department and the Board to coordinate 
the ADAAG provisions and any substantive changes to them with the ANSI 
A117 committee in order to maintain a consistent and uniform set of 
accessibility standards that can be efficiently and effectively 
implemented at the State and local level through the existing building 
regulatory processes.
    The Department shares the commenters' goal of coordination between 
the private sector and Federal standards, to the extent that 
coordination can lead to substantive requirements consistent with the 
ADA. A single accessibility standard, or consistent accessibility 
standards, that can be used for ADA purposes and that can be 
incorporated or referenced by State and local governments, would help to 
ensure that the ADA requirements are routinely implemented at the design 
stage. The Department plans to work toward this goal.
    The Department, however, must comply with the requirements of the 
ADA, the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C app. 1 et seq.) and the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C 551 et seq.). Neither the 
Department nor the Board can adopt private requirements wholesale. 
Furthermore, neither the 1991 ANSI A117 Standard revision nor the BCMC 
process is complete. Although the ANSI and BCMC provisions are not 
final, the Board has carefully considered both the draft BCMC scoping 
provisions and draft ANSI technical standards and included their 
language in ADAAG wherever consistent with the ADA.
    Some commenters requested that, if the Department did not adopt ANSI 
by reference, the Department declare compliance with ANSI/BCMC to 
constitute equivalency with the ADA standards. The Department has not 
adopted this recommendation but has instead worked as a member of the 
ATBCB to ensure that its accessibility standards are practical and 
usable. In addition, as explained under subpart F, Certification of 
State Laws or Local Building Codes, the proper forum for further 
evaluation of this suggested approach would be in conjunction with the 
certification process.
    Some commenters urged the Department to allow an additional comment 
period after the Board published its guidelines in final form, for 
purposes of affording the public a further opportunity to evaluate the 
appropriateness of including them as the Departments accessibility 
standards. Such an additional comment period is unnecessary and would 
unduly delay the issuance of final regulations. The Department put the 
public on notice, through the proposed rule, of its intention to adopt 
the proposed ADAAG, with any changes made by the Board, as the 
accessibility standards. As a member of the Board and of its ADA Task 
Force, the Department participated actively in the public hearings held 
on the proposed guidelines and in preparation of both the proposed and 
final versions of ADAAG. Many individuals and groups commented directly 
to the Department's docket, or at its public hearings, about ADAAG. The 
comments received on ADAAG, whether by the Board or by this Department, 
were thoroughly analyzed and considered by the Department in the context 
of whether the proposed ADAAG was consistent with the ADA and suitable 
for adoption as both guidelines and standards. The Department is 
convinced that ADAAG as adopted in its final form is appropriate for 
these purposes. The final guidelines, adopted here as standards, will 
ensure the high level of access contemplated by Congress, consistent 
with the ADA's balance between the interests of people with disabilities 
and the business community.

[[Page 741]]

    A few commenters, citing the Senate report (at 70) and the Education 
and Labor report (at 119), asked the Department to include in the 
regulations a provision stating that departures from particular 
technical and scoping requirements of the accessibility standards will 
be permitted so long as the alternative methods used will provide 
substantially equivalent or greater access to and utilization of the 
facility. Such a provision is found in ADAAG 2.2 and by virtue of that 
fact is included in these regulations.

            Comments on specific provisions of proposed ADAAG

    During the course of accepting comments on its proposed rule, the 
Department received numerous comments on ADAAG. Those areas that 
elicited the heaviest response included assistive listening systems, 
automated teller machines, work areas, parking, areas of refuge, 
telephones (scoping for TDD's and volume controls) and visual alarms. 
Strenuous objections were raised by some business commenters to the 
proposed provisions of the guidelines concerning check-out aisles, 
counters, and scoping for hotels and nursing facilities. All these 
comments were considered in the same manner as other comments on the 
Department's proposed rule and, in the Department's view, have been 
addressed adequately in the final ADAAG.
    Largely in response to comments, the Board made numerous changes 
from its proposal, including the following:
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Generally, at least 50% of public entrances to 
new buildings must be accessible, rather than all entrances, as would 
often have resulted from the proposed approach.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Not all check-out aisles are required to be 
accessible.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> The final guidelines provide greater flexibility 
in providing access to sales counters, and no longer require a portion 
of every counter to be accessible.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Scoping for TDD's or text telephones was 
increased. One TDD or text telephone, for speech and hearing impaired 
persons, must be provided at locations with 4, rather than 6, pay 
phones, and in hospitals and shopping malls. Use of portable (less 
expensive) TDD's is allowed.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Dispersal of wheelchair seating areas in theaters 
will be required only where there are more than 300 seats, rather than 
in all cases. Seats with removable armrests (i.e., seats into which 
persons with mobility impairments can transfer) will also be required.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Areas of refuge (areas with direct access to a 
stairway, and where people who cannot use stairs may await assistance 
during an emergency evacuation) will be required, as proposed, but the 
final provisions are based on the Uniform Building Code. Such areas are 
not required in alterations.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Rather than requiring 5% of new hotel rooms to be 
accessible to people with mobility impairments, between 2 and 4% 
accessibility (depending on total number of rooms) is required. In 
addition, 1% of the rooms must have roll-in showers.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> The proposed rule reserved the provisions on 
alterations to homeless shelters. The final guidelines apply alterations 
requirements to homeless shelters, but the requirements are less 
stringent than those applied to other types of facilities.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Parking spaces that can be used by people in vans 
(with lifts) will be required.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> As mandated by the ADA, the Board has established 
a procedure to be followed with respect to alterations to historic 
facilities.

                            Summary of ADAAG

    This section of the preamble summarizes the structure of ADAAG, and 
highlights the more important portions.

                 <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Sections 1 Through 3

    Sections 1 through 3 contain general requirements, including 
definitions.

              <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Section 4.1.1, Application

    Section 4 contains scoping requirements. Section 4.1.1, Application, 
provides that all areas of newly designed or newly constructed buildings 
and facilities and altered portions of existing buildings and facilities 
required to be accessible by Sec. 4.1.6 must comply with the guidelines 
unless otherwise provided in Sec. 4.1.1 or a special application 
section. It addresses areas used only by employees as work areas, 
temporary structures, and general exceptions.
    Section 4.1.1(3) preserves the basic principle of the proposed rule: 
Areas that may be used by employees with disabilities shall be designed 
and constructed so that an individual with a disability can approach, 
enter, and exit the area. The language has been clarified to provide 
that it applies to any area used only as a work area (not just to areas 
``that may be used by employees with disabilities''), and that the 
guidelines do not require that any area used as an individual work 
station be designed with maneuvering space or equipped to be accessible. 
The appendix to ADAAG explains that work areas must meet the guidelines' 
requirements for doors and accessible routes, and recommends, but does 
not require, that 5% of individual work stations be designed to permit a 
person using a wheelchair to maneuver within the space.
    Further discussion of work areas is found in the preamble concerning 
proposed Sec. 36.401(b).
    Section 4.1.1(5)(a) includes an exception for structural 
impracticability that corresponds to the one found in Sec. 36.401(c) 
and discussed in that portion of the preamble.

[[Page 742]]

    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Section 4.1.2, Accessible Sites and Exterior 
                      Facilities: New Construction

    This section addresses exterior features, elements, or spaces such 
as parking, portable toilets, and exterior signage, in new construction. 
Interior elements and spaces are covered by Sec. 4.1.3.
    The final rule retains the UFAS scoping for parking but also 
requires that at least one of every eight accessible parking spaces be 
designed with adequate adjacent space to deploy a lift used with a van. 
These spaces must have a sign indicating that they are van-accessible, 
but they are not to be reserved exclusively for van users.

<bullet<ls-thn-eq> Section 4.1.3, Accessible Buildings: New Construction

    This section establishes scoping requirements for new construction 
of buildings and facilities.
    Sections 4.1.3 (1) through (4) cover accessible routes, protruding 
objects, ground and floor surfaces, and stairs.
    Section 4.1.3(5) generally requires elevators to serve each level in 
a newly constructed building, with four exceptions included in the 
subsection. Exception 1 is the ``elevator exception'' established in 
Sec. 36.401(d), which must be read with this section. Exception 4 
allows the use of platform lifts under certain conditions.
    Section 4.1.3(6), Windows, is reserved. Section 4.1.3(7) applies to 
doors.
    Under Sec. 4.1.3(8), at least 50% of all public entrances must be 
accessible. In addition, if a building is designed to provide access to 
enclosed parking, pedestrian tunnels, or elevated walkways, at least one 
entrance that serves each such function must be accessible. Each tenancy 
in a building must be served by an accessible entrance. Where local 
regulations (e.g., fire codes) require that a minimum number of exits be 
provided, an equivalent number of accessible entrances must be provided. 
(The latter provision does not require a greater number of entrances 
than otherwise planned.)
    ADAAG Section 4.1.3(9), with accompanying technical requirements in 
Section 4.3, requires an area of rescue assistance (i.e., an area with 
direct access to an exit stairway and where people who are unable to use 
stairs may await assistance during an emergency evacuation) to be 
established on each floor of a multi-story building. This was one of the 
most controversial provisions in the guidelines. The final ADAAG is 
based on current Uniform Building Code requirements and retains the 
requirement that areas of refuge (renamed ``areas of rescue 
assistance'') be provided, but specifies that this requirement does not 
apply to buildings that have a supervised automatic sprinkler system. 
Areas of refuge are not required in alterations.
    The next seven subsections deal with drinking fountains (Sec. 
4.1.3(10)); toilet facilities (Sec. 4.1.3(11)); storage, shelving, and 
display units (Sec. 4.1.3(12)), controls and operating mechanisms 
(Sec. 4.1.3(13)), emergency warning systems (Sec. 4.1.3(14)), 
detectable warnings (Sec. 4.1.3(15)), and building signage (Sec. 
4.1.3(16)). Paragraph 11 requires that toilet facilities comply with 
Sec. 4.22, which requires one accessible toilet stall 
(60<<gr-thn-eq>x60<<gr-thn-eq>) in each newly constructed restroom. In 
response to public comments, the final rule requires that a second 
accessible stall (36<<gr-thn-eq>x60<<gr-thn-eq>) be provided in 
restrooms that have six or more stalls.
    ADAAG Section 4.1.3(17) establishes requirements for accessibility 
of pay phones to persons with mobility impairments, hearing impairments 
(requiring some phones with volume controls), and those who cannot use 
voice telephones. It requires one interior ``text telephone'' to be 
provided at any facility that has a total of four or more public pay 
phones. (The term ``text telephone'' has been adopted to reflect current 
terminology and changes in technology.) In addition, text telephones 
will be required in specific locations, such as covered shopping malls, 
hospitals (in emergency rooms, waiting rooms, and recovery areas), and 
convention centers.
    Paragraph 18 of Section 4.1.3 generally requires that at least five 
percent of fixed or built-in seating or tables be accessible.
    Paragraph 19, covering assembly areas, specifies the number of 
wheelchair seating spaces and types and numbers of assistive listening 
systems required. It requires dispersal of wheelchair seating locations 
in facilities where there are more than 300 seats. The guidelines also 
require that at least one percent of all fixed seats be aisle seats 
without armrests (or with moveable armrests) on the aisle side to 
increase accessibility for persons with mobility impairments who prefer 
to transfer from their wheelchairs to fixed seating. In addition, the 
final ADAAG requires that fixed seating for a companion be located 
adjacent to each wheelchair location.
    Paragraph 20 requires that where automated teller machines are 
provided, at least one must comply with section 4.34, which, among other 
things, requires accessible controls, and instructions and other 
information that are accessible to persons with sight impairments.
    Under paragraph 21, where dressing rooms are provided, five percent 
or at least one must comply with section 4.35.

               <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Section 4.1.5, Additions

    Each addition to an existing building or facility is regarded as an 
alteration subject to Sec. Sec. 36.402 through 36.406 of subpart D, 
including the date established in Sec. 36.402(a). But additions also 
have attributes of new construction, and to the extent that a space or 
element in the addition is newly constructed,

[[Page 743]]

each new space or element must comply with the applicable scoping 
provisions of sections 4.1.1 to 4.1.3 for new construction, the 
applicable technical specifications of sections 4.2 through 4.34, and 
any applicable special provisions in sections 5 through 10. For 
instance, if a restroom is provided in the addition, it must comply with 
the requirements for new construction. Construction of an addition does 
not, however, create an obligation to retrofit the entire existing 
building or facility to meet requirements for new construction. Rather, 
the addition is to be regarded as an alteration and to the extent that 
it affects or could affect the usability of or access to an area 
containing a primary function, the requirements in section 4.1.6(2) are 
triggered with respect to providing an accessible path of travel to the 
altered area and making the restrooms, telephones, and drinking 
fountains serving the altered area accessible. For example, if a museum 
adds a new wing that does not have a separate entrance as part of the 
addition, an accessible path of travel would have to be provided through 
the existing building or facility unless it is disproportionate to the 
overall cost and scope of the addition as established in Sec. 
36.403(f).

              <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Section 4.1.6, Alterations

    An alteration is a change to a building or facility that affects or 
could affect the usability of or access to the building or facility or 
any part thereof. There are three general principles for alterations. 
First, if any existing element or space is altered, the altered element 
or space must meet new construction requirements (section 4.1.6(1)(b)). 
Second, if alterations to the elements in a space when considered 
together amount to an alteration of the space, the entire space must 
meet new construction requirements (section 4.1.6(1)(c)). Third, if the 
alteration affects or could affect the usability of or access to an area 
containing a primary function, the path of travel to the altered area 
and the restrooms, drinking fountains, and telephones serving the 
altered area must be made accessible unless it is disproportionate to 
the overall alterations in terms of cost and scope as determined under 
criteria established by the Attorney General (Sec. 4.1.6(2)).
    Section 4.1.6 should be read with Sec. Sec. 36.402 through 36.405. 
Requirements concerning alterations to an area serving a primary 
function are addressed with greater detail in the latter sections than 
in section 4.1.6(2). Section 4.1.6(1)(j) deals with technical 
infeasibility. Section 4.1.6(3) contains special technical provisions 
for alterations to existing buildings and facilities.

         <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Section 4.1.7, Historic Preservation

    This section contains scoping provisions and alternative 
requirements for alterations to qualified historic buildings and 
facilities. It clarifies the procedures under the National Historic 
Preservation Act and their application to alterations covered by the 
ADA. An individual seeking to alter a facility that is subject to the 
ADA guidelines and to State or local historic preservation statutes 
shall consult with the State Historic Preservation Officer to determine 
if the planned alteration would threaten or destroy the historic 
significance of the facility.

              <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Sections 4.2 Through 4.35

    Sections 4.2 through 4.35 contain the technical specifications for 
elements and spaces required to be accessible by the scoping provisions 
(sections 4.1 through 4.1.7) and special application sections (sections 
5 through 10). The technical specifications are the same as the 1980 
version of ANSI A117.1 standard, except as noted in the text by italics.

                 <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Sections 5 Through 9

    These are special application sections and contain additional 
requirements for restaurants and cafeterias, medical care facilities, 
business and mercantile facilities, libraries, and transient lodging. 
For example, at least 5 percent, but not less than one, of the fixed 
tables in a restaurant must be accessible.
    In section 7, Business and Mercantile, paragraph 7.2 (Sales and 
Service Counters, Teller Windows, Information Counters) has been revised 
to provide greater flexibility in new construction than did the proposed 
rule. At least one of each type of sales or service counter where a cash 
register is located shall be made accessible. Accessible counters shall 
be dispersed throughout the facility. At counters such as bank teller 
windows or ticketing counters, alternative methods of compliance are 
permitted. A public accommodation may lower a portion of the counter, 
provide an auxiliary counter, or provide equivalent facilitation through 
such means as installing a folding shelf on the front of the counter at 
an accessible height to provide a work surface for a person using a 
wheelchair.
    Section 7.3., Check-out Aisles, provides that, in new construction, 
a certain number of each design of check-out aisle, as listed in a chart 
based on the total number of check-out aisles of each design, shall be 
accessible. The percentage of check-outs required to be accessible 
generally ranges from 20% to 40%. In a newly constructed or altered 
facility with less than 5,000 square feet of selling space, at least one 
of each type of check-out aisle must be accessible. In altered 
facilities with 5,000 or more square feet of selling space, at least one 
of each design of check-out aisle must be made accessible when altered, 
until the number of accessible aisles

[[Page 744]]

of each design equals the number that would be required for new 
construction.

       <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Section 9, Accessible Transient Lodging

    Section 9 addresses two types of transient lodging: hotels, motels, 
inns, boarding houses, dormitories, resorts, and other similar places 
(sections 9.1 through 9.4); and homeless shelters, halfway houses, 
transient group homes, and other social service establishments (section 
9.5). The interplay of the ADA and Fair Housing Act with respect to such 
facilities is addressed in the preamble discussion of the definition of 
``place of public accommodation'' in Sec. 36.104.
    The final rule establishes scoping requirements for accessibility of 
newly constructed hotels. Four percent of the first hundred rooms, and 
roughly two percent of rooms in excess of 100, must meet certain 
requirements for accessibility to persons with mobility or hearing 
impairments, and an additional identical percentage must be accessible 
to persons with hearing impairments. An additional 1% of the available 
rooms must be equipped with roll-in showers, raising the actual scoping 
for rooms accessible to persons with mobility impairments to 5% of the 
first hundred rooms and 3% thereafter. The final ADAAG also provides 
that when a hotel is being altered, one fully accessible room and one 
room equipped with visual alarms, notification devices, and amplified 
telephones shall be provided for each 25 rooms being altered until the 
number of accessible rooms equals that required under the new 
construction standard. Accessible rooms must be dispersed in a manner 
that will provide persons with disabilities with a choice of single or 
multiple-bed accommodations.
    In new construction, homeless shelters and other social service 
entities must comply with ADAAG; at least one type of amenity in each 
common area must be accessible. In a facility that is not required to 
have an elevator, it is not necessary to provide accessible amenities on 
the inaccessible floors if at least one of each type of amenity is 
provided in accessible common areas. The percentage of accessible 
sleeping accommodations required is the same as that required for other 
places of transient lodging. Requirements for facilities altered for use 
as a homeless shelter parallel the current MGRAD accessibility 
requirements for leased buildings. A shelter located in an altered 
facility must have at least one accessible entrance, accessible sleeping 
accommodations in a number equivalent to that established for new 
construction, at least one accessible toilet and bath, at least one 
accessible common area, and an accessible route connecting all 
accessible areas. All accessible areas in a homeless shelter in an 
altered facility may be located on one level.

                  Section 10, Transportation Facilities

    Section 10 of ADAAG is reserved. On March 20, 1991, the ATBCB 
published a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (56 FR 11874) to 
establish special access requirements for transportation facilities. The 
Department anticipates that when the ATBCB issues final guidelines for 
transportation facilities, this part will be amended to include those 
provisions.

                         Subpart E--Enforcement

    Because the Department of Justice does not have authority to 
establish procedures for judicial review and enforcement, subpart E 
generally restates the statutory procedures for enforcement.
    Section 36.501 describes the procedures for private suits by 
individuals and the judicial remedies available. In addition to the 
language in section 308(a)(1) of the Act, Sec. 36.501(a) of this part 
includes the language from section 204(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 
1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000a-3(a)) which is incorporated by reference in the 
ADA. A commenter noted that the proposed rule did not include the 
provision in section 204(a) allowing the court to appoint an attorney 
for the complainant and authorize the commencement of the civil action 
without the payment of fees, costs, or security. That provision has been 
included in the final rule.
    Section 308(a)(1) of the ADA permits a private suit by an individual 
who has reasonable grounds for believing that he or she is ``about to 
be'' subjected to discrimination in violation of section 303 of the Act 
(subpart D of this part), which requires that new construction and 
alterations be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with 
disabilities. Authorizing suits to prevent construction of facilities 
with architectural barriers will avoid the necessity of costly 
retrofitting that might be required if suits were not permitted until 
after the facilities were completed. To avoid unnecessary suits, this 
section requires that the individual bringing the suit have `reasonable 
grounds' for believing that a violation is about to occur, but does not 
require the individual to engage in a futile gesture if he or she has 
notice that a person or organization covered by title III of the Act 
does not intend to comply with its provisions.
    Section 36.501(b) restates the provisions of section 308(a)(2) of 
the Act, which states that injunctive relief for the failure to remove 
architectural barriers in existing facilities or the failure to make new 
construction and alterations accessible ``shall include'' an order to 
alter these facilities to make them readily accessible to and usable by 
persons with disabilities to the extent required by title III. The 
Report of the Energy and Commerce Committee notes that ``an order to 
make a facility readily accessible to and usable by

[[Page 745]]

individuals with disabilities is mandatory'' under this standard. H.R. 
Rep. No. 485, 101st Cong., 2d Sess, pt 4, at 64 (1990). Also, injunctive 
relief shall include, where appropriate, requiring the provision of an 
auxiliary aid or service, modification of a policy, or provision of 
alternative methods, to the extent required by title III of the Act and 
this part.
    Section 36.502 is based on section 308(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, which 
provides that the Attorney General shall investigate alleged violations 
of title III and undertake periodic reviews of compliance of covered 
entities. Although the Act does not establish a comprehensive 
administrative enforcement mechanism for investigation and resolution of 
all complaints received, the legislative history notes that 
investigation of alleged violations and periodic compliance reviews are 
essential to effective enforcement of title III, and that the Attorney 
General is expected to engage in active enforcement and to allocate 
sufficient resources to carry out this responsibility. Judiciary Report 
at 67.
    Many commenters argued for inclusion of more specific provisions for 
administrative resolution of disputes arising under the Act and this 
part in order to promote voluntary compliance and avoid the need for 
litigation. Administrative resolution is far more efficient and 
economical than litigation, particularly in the early stages of 
implementation of complex legislation when the specific requirements of 
the statute are not widely understood. The Department has added a new 
paragraph (c) to this section authorizing the Attorney General to 
initiate a compliance review where he or she has reason to believe there 
may be a violation of this rule.
    Section 36.503 describes the procedures for suits by the Attorney 
General set out in section 308(b)(1)(B) of the Act. If the Department 
has reasonable cause to believe that any person or group of persons is 
engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of 
any of the rights granted by title III or that any person or group of 
persons has been denied any of the rights granted by title III and such 
denial raises an issue of general public importance, the Attorney 
General may commence a civil action in any appropriate United States 
district court. The proposed rule provided for suit by the Attorney 
General ``or his or her designee.'' The reference to a ``designee'' has 
been omitted in the final rule because it is unnecessary. The Attorney 
General has delegated enforcement authority under the ADA to the 
Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. 55 FR 40653 (October 4, 
1990) (to be codified at 28 CFR 0.50(l).)
    Section 36.504 describes the relief that may be granted in a suit by 
the Attorney General under section 308(b)(2) of the Act. In such an 
action, the court may grant any equitable relief it considers to be 
appropriate, including granting temporary, preliminary, or permanent 
relief, providing an auxiliary aid or service, modification of policy or 
alternative method, or making facilities readily accessible to and 
usable by individuals with disabilities, to the extent required by title 
III. In addition, a court may award such other relief as the court 
considers to be appropriate, including monetary damages to persons 
aggrieved, when requested by the Attorney General.
    Furthermore, the court may vindicate the public interest by 
assessing a civil penalty against the covered entity in an amount not 
exceeding $50,000 for a first violation and not exceeding $100,000 for 
any subsequent violation. Section 36.504(b) of the rule adopts the 
standard of section 308(b)(3) of the Act. This section makes it clear 
that, in counting the number of previous determinations of violations 
for determining whether a ``first'' or ``subsequent'' violation has 
occurred, determinations in the same action that the entity has engaged 
in more than one discriminatory act are to be counted as a single 
violation. A ``second violation'' would not accrue to that entity until 
the Attorney General brought another suit against the entity and the 
entity was again held in violation. Again, all of the violations found 
in the second suit would be cumulatively considered as a ``subsequent 
violation.''
    Section 36.504(c) clarifies that the terms ``monetary damages'' and 
``other relief'' do not include punitive damages. They do include, 
however, all forms of compensatory damages, including out-of-pocket 
expenses and damages for pain and suffering.
    Section 36.504(a)(3) is based on section 308(b)(2)(C) of the Act, 
which provides that, ``to vindicate the public interest,'' a court may 
assess a civil penalty against the entity that has been found to be in 
violation of the Act in suits brought by the Attorney General. In 
addition, Sec. 36.504(d), which is taken from section 308(b)(5) of the 
Act, further provides that, in considering what amount of civil penalty, 
if any, is appropriate, the court shall give consideration to ``any good 
faith effort or attempt to comply with this part.'' In evaluating such 
good faith, the court shall consider ``among other factors it deems 
relevant, whether the entity could have reasonably anticipated the need 
for an appropriate type of auxiliary aid needed to accommodate the 
unique needs of a particular individual with a disability.''
    The ``good faith'' standard referred to in this section is not 
intended to imply a willful or intentional standard--that is, an entity 
cannot demonstrate good faith simply by showing that it did not 
willfully, intentionally, or recklessly disregard the law. At the same 
time, the absence of such a course of conduct would be a factor a court 
should weigh in determining the existence of good faith.

[[Page 746]]

    Section 36.505 states that courts are authorized to award attorneys 
fees, including litigation expenses and costs, as provided in section 
505 of the Act. Litigation expenses include items such as expert witness 
fees, travel expenses, etc. The Judiciary Committee Report specifies 
that such items are included under the rubric of ``attorneys fees'' and 
not ``costs'' so that such expenses will be assessed against a plaintiff 
only under the standard set forth in Christiansburg Garment Co. v. Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission, 434 U.S. 412 (1978). (Judiciary 
report at 73.)
    Section 36.506 restates section 513 of the Act, which encourages use 
of alternative means of dispute resolution. Section 36.507 explains 
that, as provided in section 506(e) of the Act, a public accommodation 
or other private entity is not excused from compliance with the 
requirements of this part because of any failure to receive technical 
assistance.

                      Section 36.305 Effective Date

    In general, title III is effective 18 months after enactment of the 
Americans with Disabilities Act, i.e., January 26, 1992. However, there 
are several exceptions to this general rule contained throughout title 
III. Section 36.508 sets forth all of these exceptions in one place.
    Paragraph (b) contains the rule on civil actions. It states that, 
except with respect to new construction and alterations, no civil action 
shall be brought for a violation of this part that occurs before July 
26, 1992, against businesses with 25 or fewer employees and gross 
receipts of $1,000,000 or less; and before January 26, 1993, against 
businesses with 10 or fewer employees and gross receipts of $500,000 or 
less. In determining what constitutes gross receipts, it is appropriate 
to exclude amounts collected for sales taxes.
    Paragraph (c) concerns transportation services provided by public 
accommodations not primarily engaged in the business of transporting 
people. The 18-month effective date applies to all of the transportation 
provisions except those requiring newly purchased or leased vehicles to 
be accessible. Vehicles subject to that requirement must be accessible 
to and usable by individuals with disabilities if the solicitation for 
the vehicle is made on or after August 26, 1990.

     Subpart F--Certification of State Labs or Local Building Codes

    Subpart F establishes procedures to implement section 
308(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Act, which provides that, on the application of 
a State or local government, the Attorney General may certify that a 
State law or local building code or similar ordinance meets or exceeds 
the minimum accessibility requirements of the Act. In enforcement 
proceedings, this certification will constitute rebuttable evidence that 
the law or code meets or exceeds the ADA's requirements.
    Three significant changes, further explained below, were made from 
the proposed subpart, in response to comments. First, the State or local 
jurisdiction is required to hold a public hearing on its proposed 
request for certification and to submit to the Department, as part of 
the information and materials in support of a request for certification, 
a transcript of the hearing. Second, the time allowed for interested 
persons and organizations to comment on the request filed with the 
Department (Sec. 36.605(a)(1)) has been changed from 30 to 60 days. 
Finally, a new Sec. 36.608, Guidance concerning model codes, has been 
added.
    Section 36.601 establishes the definitions to be used for purposes 
of this subpart. Two of the definitions have been modified, and a 
definition of ``model code'' has been added. First, in response to a 
comment, a reference to a code ``or part thereof'' has been added to the 
definition of ``code.'' The purpose of this addition is to clarify that 
an entire code need not be submitted if only part of it is relevant to 
accessibility, or if the jurisdiction seeks certification of only some 
of the portions that concern accessibility. The Department does not 
intend to encourage ``piecemeal'' requests for certification by a single 
jurisdiction. In fact, the Department expects that in some cases, rather 
than certifying portions of a particular code and refusing to certify 
others, it may notify a submitting jurisdiction of deficiencies and 
encourage a reapplication that cures those deficiencies, so that the 
entire code can be certified eventually. Second, the definition of 
``submitting official'' has been modified. The proposed rule defined the 
submitting official to be the State or local official who has principal 
responsibility for administration of a code. Commenters pointed out that 
in some cases more than one code within the same jurisdiction is 
relevant for purposes of certification. It was also suggested that the 
Department allow a State to submit a single application on behalf of the 
State, as well as on behalf of any local jurisdictions required to 
follow the State accessibility requirements. Consistent with these 
comments, the Department has added to the definition language clarifying 
that the official can be one authorized to submit a code on behalf of a 
jurisdiction.
    A definition of ``model code'' has been added in light of new Sec. 
36.608.
    Most commenters generally approved of the proposed certification 
process. Some approved of what they saw as the Department's attempt to 
bring State and local codes into alignment with the ADA. A State agency 
said that this section will be the backbone of the intergovernmental 
cooperation essential

[[Page 747]]

if the accessibility provisions of the ADA are to be effective.
    Some comments disapproved of the proposed process as timeconsuming 
and laborious for the Department, although some of these comments 
pointed out that, if the Attorney General certified model codes on which 
State and local codes are based, many perceived problems would be 
alleviated. (This point is further addressed by new Sec. 36.608.)
    Many of the comments received from business organizations, as well 
as those from some individuals and disability rights groups, addressed 
the relationship of the ADA requirements and their enforcement, to 
existing State and local codes and code enforcement systems. These 
commenters urged the Department to use existing code-making bodies for 
interpretations of the ADA, and to actively participate in the 
integration of the ADA into the text of the national model codes that 
are adopted by State and local enforcement agencies. These issues are 
discussed in preamble section 36.406 under General comments.
    Many commenters urged the Department to evaluate or certify the 
entire code enforcement system (including any process for hearing 
appeals from builders of denials by the building code official of 
requests for variances, waivers, or modifications). Some urged that 
certification not be allowed in jurisdictions where waivers can be 
granted, unless there is a clearly identified decision-making process, 
with written rulings and notice to affected parties of any waiver or 
modification request. One commenter urged establishment of a dispute 
resolution mechanism, providing for interpretation (usually through a 
building official) and an administrative appeals mechanism (generally 
called Boards of Appeal, Boards of Construction Appeals, or Boards of 
Review), before certification could be granted.
    The Department thoroughly considered these proposals but has 
declined to provide for certification of processes of enforcement or 
administration of State and local codes. The statute clearly authorizes 
the Department to certify the codes themselves for equivalency with the 
statute; it would be ill-advised for the Department at this point to 
inquire beyond the face of the code and written interpretations of it. 
It would be inappropriate to require those jurisdictions that grant 
waivers or modifications to establish certain procedures before they can 
apply for certification, or to insist that no deviations can be 
permitted. In fact, the Department expects that many jurisdictions will 
allow slight variations from a particular code, consistent with ADAAG 
itself. ADAAG includes in Sec. 2.2 a statement allowing departures from 
particular requirements where substantially equivalent or greater access 
and usability is provided. Several sections specifically allow for 
alternative methods providing equivalent facilitation and, in some 
cases, provide examples. (See, e.g., section 4.31.9, Text Telephones; 
section 7.2(2) (iii), Sales and Service Counters.) Section 4.1.6 
includes less stringent requirements that are permitted in alterations, 
in certain circumstances.
    However, in an attempt to ensure that it does not certify a code 
that in practice has been or will be applied in a manner that defeats 
its equivalency with the ADA, the Department will require that the 
submitting official include, with the application for certification, any 
relevant manuals, guides, or any other interpretive information issued 
that pertain to the code. (Sec. 36.603(c)(1).) The requirement that 
this information be provided is in addition to the NPRM's requirement 
that the official provide any pertinent formal opinions of the State 
Attorney General or the chief legal officer of the jurisdiction.
    The first step in the certification process is a request for 
certification, filed by a ``submitting official'' (Sec. 36.603). The 
Department will not accept requests for certification until after 
January 26, 1992, the effective date of this part. The Department 
received numerous comments from individuals and organizations 
representing a variety of interests, urging that the hearing required to 
be held by the Assistant Attorney General in Washington, DC, after a 
preliminary determination of equivalency (Sec. 36.605(a)(2)), be held 
within the State or locality requesting certification, in order to 
facilitate greater participation by all interested parties. While the 
Department has not modified the requirement that it hold a hearing in 
Washington, it has added a new subparagraph 36.603(b)(3) requiring a 
hearing within the State or locality before a request for certification 
is filed. The hearing must be held after adequate notice to the public 
and must be on the record; a transcript must be provided with the 
request for certification. This procedure will insure input from the 
public at the State or local level and will also insure a Washington, 
DC, hearing as mentioned in the legislative history.
    The request for certification, along with supporting documents 
(Sec. 36.603(c)), must be filed in duplicate with the office of the 
Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. The Assistant Attorney 
General may request further information. The request and supporting 
materials will be available for public examination at the office of the 
Assistant Attorney General and at the office of the State or local 
agency charged with administration and enforcement of the code. The 
submitting official must publish public notice of the request for 
certification.
    Next, under Sec. 36.604, the Assistant Attorney General's office 
will consult with the ATBCB and make a preliminary determination to 
either (1) find that the code is equivalent

[[Page 748]]

(make a ``preliminary determination of equivalency'') or (2) deny 
certification. The next step depends on which of these preliminary 
determinations is made.
    If the preliminary determination is to find equivalency, the 
Assistant Attorney General, under Sec. 36.605, will inform the 
submitting official in writing of the preliminary determination and 
publish a notice in the Federal Register informing the public of the 
preliminary determination and inviting comment for 60 days. (This time 
period has been increased from 30 days in light of public comment 
pointing out the need for more time within which to evaluate the code.) 
After considering the information received in response to the comments, 
the Department will hold a hearing in Washington. This hearing will not 
be subject to the formal requirements of the Administrative Procedure 
Act. In fact, this requirement could be satisfied by a meeting with 
interested parties. After the hearing, the Assistant Attorney General's 
office will consult again with the ATBCB and make a final determination 
of equivalency or a final determination to deny the request for 
certification, with a notice of the determination published in the 
Federal Register.
    1If the preliminary determination is to deny certification, there 
will be no hearing (Sec. 36.606). The Department will notify the 
submitting official of the preliminary determination, and may specify 
how the code could be modified in order to receive a preliminary 
determination of equivalency. The Department will allow at least 15 days 
for the submitting official to submit relevant material in opposition to 
the preliminary denial. If none is received, no further action will be 
taken. If more information is received, the Department will consider it 
and make either a final decision to deny certification or a preliminary 
determination of equivalency. If at that stage the Assistant Attorney 
General makes a preliminary determination of equivalency, the hearing 
procedures set out in Sec. 36.605 will be followed.
    Section 36.607 addresses the effect of certification. First, 
certification will only be effective concerning those features or 
elements that are both (1) covered by the certified code and (2) 
addressed by the regulations against which they are being certified. For 
example, if children's facilities are not addressed by the Department's 
standards, and the building in question is a private elementary school, 
certification will not be effective for those features of the building 
to be used by children. And if the Department's regulations addressed 
equipment but the local code did not, a building's equipment would not 
be covered by the certification.
    In addition, certification will be effective only for the particular 
edition of the code that is certified. Amendments will not automatically 
be considered certified, and a submitting official will need to reapply 
for certification of the changed or additional provisions.
    Certification will not be effective in those situations where a 
State or local building code official allows a facility to be 
constructed or altered in a manner that does not follow the technical or 
scoping provisions of the certified code. Thus, if an official either 
waives an accessible element or feature or allows a change that does not 
provide equivalent facilitation, the fact that the Department has 
certified the code itself will not stand as evidence that the facility 
has been constructed or altered in accordance with the minimum 
accessibility requirements of the ADA. The Department's certification of 
a code is effective only with respect to the standards in the code; it 
is not to be interpreted to apply to a State or local government's 
application of the code. The fact that the Department has certified a 
code with provisions concerning waivers, variances, or equivalent 
facilitation shall not be interpreted as an endorsement of actions taken 
pursuant to those provisions.
    The final rule includes a new Sec. 36.608 concerning model codes. 
It was drafted in response to concerns raised by numerous commenters, 
many of which have been discussed under General comments (Sec. 36.406). 
It is intended to assist in alleviating the difficulties posed by 
attempting to certify possibly tens of thousands of codes. It is 
included in recognition of the fact that many codes are based on, or 
incorporate, model or consensus standards developed by nationally 
recognized organizations (e.g., the American National Standards 
Institute (ANSI); Building Officials and Code Administrators (BOCA) 
International; Council of American Building Officials (CABO) and its 
Board for the Coordination of Model Codes (BCMC); Southern Building Code 
Congress International (SBCCI)). While the Department will not certify 
or ``precertify'' model codes, as urged by some commenters, it does wish 
to encourage the continued viability of the consensus and model code 
process consistent with the purposes of the ADA.
    The new section therefore allows an authorized representative of a 
private entity responsible for developing a model code to apply to the 
Assistant Attorney General for review of the code. The review process 
will be informal and will not be subject to the procedures of Sec. Sec. 
36.602 through 36.607. The result of the review will take the form of 
guidance from the Assistant Attorney General as to whether and in what 
respects the model code is consistent with the ADA's requirements. The 
guidance will not be binding on any entity or on the Department; it will 
assist in evaluations of individual State or local codes and may serve 
as a basis for establishing priorities for consideration of individual 
codes. The Department anticipates

[[Page 749]]

that this approach will foster further cooperation among various 
government levels, the private entities developing standards, and 
individuals with disabilities.

Sec. 37.5  Date of receipt.

    A complaint or charge of employment discrimination is deemed to be

[[Page 751]]

filed, for purposes of determining timeliness, on the date the complaint 
or charge is first received by a Federal agency with section 504 or ADA 
jurisdiction, regardless of whether it is subsequently transferred to 
another agency for processing.


<R05>
Sec. 37.6  Processing of complaints of employment discrimination filed with 

an agency other than the EEOC.

    (a) Agency determination of jurisdiction. Upon receipt of a 
complaint of employment discrimination, an agency other than the EEOC 
shall:
    (1) Determine whether it has jurisdiction over the complaint under 
section 504 or under title II of the ADA; and
    (2) Determine whether the EEOC may have jurisdiction over the 
complaint under title I of the ADA.
    (b) Referral to the Civil Rights Division. If the agency determines 
that it does not have jurisdiction under section 504 or title II, and 
determines that the EEOC does not have jurisdiction under title I, the 
agency shall promptly refer the complaint to the Civil Rights Division. 
The Civil Rights Division shall determine if another Federal agency may 
have jurisdiction over the complaint under section 504 or title II, and, 
if so, shall promptly refer the complaint to a section 504 or a 
designated agency with jurisdiction over the complaint.
    (c) Referral to the EEOC--(1) Referral by an agency without 
jurisdiction. If an agency determines that it does not have jurisdiction 
over a complaint of employment discrimination under either section 504 
or title II and determines that the EEOC may have jurisdiction under 
title I, the agency shall promptly refer the complaint to the EEOC for 
investigation and processing under title I of the ADA.
    (2) Referral by a section 504 agency. (i) A section 504 agency that 
otherwise has jurisdiction over a complaint of employment discrimination 
under section 504 shall promptly refer to the EEOC, for investigation 
and processing under title I of the ADA, any complaint of employment 
discrimination that solely alleges discrimination against an individual 
(and that does not allege discrimination in both employment and in other 
practices or services of the respondent or a pattern or practice of 
employment discrimination), unless:
    (A) The section 504 agency determines that the EEOC does not have 
jurisdiction over the complaint under title I; or
    (B) The EEOC has jurisdiction over the complaint under title I, but 
the complainant, either independently, or following receipt of the 
notification letter required to be sent to the complainant pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, specifically requests that the 
complaint be investigated by the section 504 agency.
    (ii) Prior to referring an individual complaint of employment 
discrimination to the EEOC pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this 
section (but not prior to making such a referral pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section), a section 504 agency that otherwise has 
jurisdiction over the complaint shall promptly notify the complainant, 
in writing, of its intention to make such a referral. The notice letter 
shall:
    (A) Inform the complainant that, unless the agency receives a 
written request from the complainant within twenty days of the date of 
the notice letter requesting that the agency retain the complaint for 
investigation, the agency will forward the complaint to the EEOC for 
investigation and processing; and
    (B) Describe the basic procedural differences between an 
investigation under section 504 and an investigation under title I, and 
inform the complainant of the potential for differing remedies under 
each statute.
    (3) Referral by a designated agency. A designated agency that does 
not have section 504 jurisdiction over a complaint of employment 
discrimination and that has determined that the EEOC may have 
jurisdiction over the complaint under title I shall promptly refer the 
complaint to the EEOC.
    (4) Processing of complaints referred to the EEOC. (i) A complaint 
referred to the EEOC in accordance with this section by an agency with 
jurisdiction over the complaint under section 504 shall be deemed to be 
a dual-filed complaint under section 504 and title I. When a section 504 
agency with jurisdiction over a complaint refers the complaint to the 
EEOC, the section 504

[[Page 752]]

agency shall defer its processing of the complaint pursuant to Sec. 
--.10, pending resolution by the EEOC.
    (ii) A complaint referred to the EEOC by an agency that has 
jurisdiction over the complaint solely under title II (and not under 
section 504) will be treated as a complaint filed under title I only.
    (iii) Any complaint referred to the EEOC pursuant to this section 
shall be processed by the EEOC under its title I procedures.
    (d) Retention by the agency for investigation--(1) Retention by a 
section 504 agency. A section 504 agency shall retain a complaint for 
investigation when the agency determines that it has jurisdiction over 
the complaint under section 504, and one or more of the following 
conditions are met:
    (i) The EEOC does not have jurisdiction over the complaint under 
title I; or
    (ii) The EEOC has jurisdiction over the complaint, but the 
complainant elects to have the section 504 agency process the complaint 
and the section 504 agency receives a written request from the 
complainant for section 504 agency processing within twenty days of the 
date of the notice letter required to be sent pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii) of this section; or
    (iii) The complaint alleges discrimination in both employment and in 
other practices or services of the respondent that are covered by 
section 504; or
    (iv) The complaint alleges a pattern or practice of employment 
discrimination.
    (2) Retention by a designated agency. A designated agency that does 
not have jurisdiction over the complaint under section 504 shall retain 
a complaint for investigation when the agency determines that it has 
jurisdiction over the complaint under title II of the ADA and that the 
EEOC does not have jurisdiction over the complaint under title I.
    (3) Processing of complaints retained by an agency. Any complaint 
retained for investigation and processing by an agency pursuant to 
paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section will be investigated and 
processed under section 504, title II, or both, as applicable, and will 
not be considered to be dual filed under title I.


<R05>
Sec. 37.7  Processing of charges of employment discrimination filed with the 

EEOC.

    (a) EEOC determination of jurisdiction. Upon receipt of a charge of 
employment discrimination, the EEOC shall:
    (1) Determine whether it has jurisdiction over the charge under 
title I of the ADA. If it has jurisdiction, except as provided in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the EEOC shall process the charge 
pursuant to title I procedures.
    (2) If the EEOC determines that it does not have jurisdiction under 
title I, the EEOC shall promptly refer the charge to the Civil Rights 
Division. The Civil Rights Division shall determine if a Federal agency 
may have jurisdiction over the charge under section 504 or title II, 
and, if so, shall refer the charge to a section 504 agency or to a 
designated agency with jurisdiction over the complaint.
    (b) Retention by the EEOC for investigation. (1) The EEOC shall 
retain a charge for investigation when it determines that it has 
jurisdiction over the charge under title I.
    (2) Referral to an agency. Any charge retained by the EEOC for 
investigation and processing will be investigated and processed under 
title I only, and will not be deemed dual filed under section 504, 
except that ADA cause charges (as defined in 29 CFR 1601.21) that also 
fall within the jurisdiction of a section 504 agency and that the EEOC 
(or the Civil Rights Division, if such a charge is against a government, 
governmental agency, or political subdivision) has declined to litigate 
shall be referred to the appropriate section 504 agency for review of 
the file and any administrative or other action deemed appropriate under 
section 504. Such charges shall be deemed complaints, dual filed under 
section 504, solely for the purposes of the agency review and action 
described in this paragraph. The date of such dual filing shall be 
deemed to be the date the complaint was received by the EEOC.

[[Page 753]]


<R05>
Sec. 37.8  Processing of complaints or charges of employment discrimination 

filed with both the EEOC and a section 504 agency.

    (a) Procedures for handling dual-filed complaints or charges. As 
between the EEOC and a section 504 agency, except as provided in 
paragraph (e) of this section, a complaint or charge of employment 
discrimination that is dual filed with both the EEOC and a section 504 
agency shall be processed as follows:
    (1) EEOC processing. The EEOC shall investigate and process the 
charge when the EEOC determines that it has jurisdiction over the charge 
under title I and the charge solely alleges employment discrimination 
against an individual, unless the charging party elects to have the 
section 504 agency process the charge and the section 504 agency 
receives a written request from the complainant for section 504 agency 
processing within twenty days of the date of the notice letter required 
to be sent pursuant to Sec. 37.6(c)(2)(ii).
    (2) Section 504 agency processing. A section 504 agency shall 
investigate and process the complaint when the agency determines that it 
has jurisdiction over the complaint under section 504, and:
    (i) The complaint alleges discrimination in both employment and in 
other practices or services of the respondent; or
    (ii) The complaint alleges a pattern or practice of discrimination 
in employment; or
    (iii) In the case of a complaint solely alleging employment 
discrimination against an individual, the complainant elects to have a 
section 504 agency process the complaint and the section 504 agency 
receives a written request from the complainant for section 504 agency 
processing within twenty days of the date of the notice letter required 
to be sent pursuant to Sec. 37.6(c)(2)(ii).
    (b) Referral to the Civil Rights Division. If the EEOC determines 
that it does not have jurisdiction under title I, and the section 504 
agency determines that it does not have jurisdiction under section 504 
or title II, the complaint or charge shall be promptly referred to the 
Civil Rights Division. The Civil Rights Division shall determine if 
another Federal agency may have jurisdiction over the complaint under 
section 504 or title II, and, if so, shall promptly refer the complaint 
to a section 504 or a designated agency with jurisdiction over the 
complaint.
    (c) Procedures for determining whether a complaint or charge has 
been dual filed. The EEOC and each agency with jurisdiction to 
investigate and process complaints of employment discrimination under 
section 504 shall jointly develop procedures for determining whether 
complaints or charges of discrimination have been dual filed with the 
EEOC and with one or more other agencies.
    (d) Notification of deferral. The agency required to process a dual-
filed complaint or charge under this section shall notify the 
complainant or charging party and the respondent that the complaint or 
charge was dual filed with one or more other agencies and that such 
other agencies have agreed to defer processing and will take no further 
action except as provided in Sec. 37.10 or Sec. 37.11, as applicable.
    (e) Exceptions. When special circumstances make deferral as provided 
in this section inappropriate, the EEOC, and an agency with 
investigative authority under section 504, may jointly determine to 
reallocate investigative responsibilities. Special circumstances 
include, but are not limited to, cases in which the EEOC has already 
commenced its investigation at the time that the agency discovers that 
the complaint or charge is a dual-filed complaint or charge in which the 
complainant has elected section 504 processing, alleged discrimination 
in both employment and in other practices or services of the respondent, 
or alleged a pattern or practice of employment discrimination.


<R05>
Sec. 37.9  Processing of complaints or charges of employment discrimination 

filed with a designated agency and either a section 504 agency, the EEOC, or 

both.

    (a) Designated agency processing. A designated agency shall 
investigate and process a complaint that has been filed with it and with 
the EEOC, a section 504 agency, or both, when either of the following 
conditions is met:

[[Page 754]]

    (1) The designated agency determines that it has jurisdiction over 
the complaint under title II and that neither the EEOC nor a section 504 
agency (other than the designated agency, if the designated agency is 
also a section 504 agency) has jurisdiction over the complaint; or
    (2) The designated agency determines that it has jurisdiction over 
the complaint under section 504 and the complaint meets the requirements 
for processing by a section 504 agency set forth in Sec. 37.8(a)(2).
    (b) Referral by a designated agency. A designated agency that has 
jurisdiction over a complaint solely under title II (and not under 
section 504) shall forward a complaint that has been filed with it and 
with the EEOC, a section 504 agency, or both, to either the EEOC or to a 
section 504 agency, as follows:
    (1) If the designated agency determines that the EEOC is the sole 
agency, other than the designated agency, with jurisdiction over the 
complaint, the designated agency shall forward the complaint to the EEOC 
for processing under title I; or
    (2) If the designated agency determines that the section 504 agency 
is the sole agency, other than the designated agency, with jurisdiction 
over the complaint, the designated agency shall forward the complaint to 
the section 504 agency for processing under section 504; or
    (3) If the designated agency determines that both the EEOC and a 
section 504 agency have jurisdiction over the complaint, the designated 
agency shall forward the complaint to the EEOC if it determines that the 
complaint solely alleges employment discrimination against an 
individual, or it shall forward the complaint to the section 504 agency 
if it determines that the complaint meets the requirements for 
processing by a section 504 agency set out in Sec. 37.8(a)(2)(i) or 
(a)(2)(ii).


<R05>
Sec. 37.10  Section 504 agency review of deferred complaints.

    (a) Deferral by the section 504 agency. When a section 504 agency 
refers a complaint to the EEOC pursuant to Sec. 37.6(c)(2) or when it 
is determined that, as between the EEOC and a section 504 agency, the 
EEOC is the agency that shall process a dual-filed complaint or charge 
under Sec. 37.8(a)(1) or Sec. 37.8(e), the section 504 agency shall 
defer further action until:
    (1) The EEOC issues a no cause finding and a notice of right-to-sue 
pursuant to 29 CFR 1601.19; or
    (2) The EEOC enters into a conciliation agreement; or
    (3) The EEOC issues a cause finding and a notice of failure of 
conciliation pursuant to 29 CFR 1601.21, and:
    (i) If the recipient is not a government, governmental agency, or 
political subdivision, the EEOC completes enforcement proceedings or 
issues a notice of right-to-sue in accordance with 29 CFR 1601.28; or
    (ii) If the recipient is a government, governmental agency, or 
political subdivision, the EEOC refers the charge to the Civil Rights 
Division in accordance with 29 CFR 1601.29, and the Civil Rights 
Division completes enforcement proceedings or issues a notice of right-
to-sue in accordance with 29 CFR 1601.28(d); or
    (4) The EEOC or, when a case has been referred pursuant to 29 CFR 
1601.29, the Civil Rights Division, otherwise resolves the charge.
    (b) Notification of the deferring agency. The EEOC or the Civil 
Rights Division, as appropriate, shall notify the agency that has 
deferred processing of the charge upon resolution of any dual-filed 
complaint or charge.
    (c) Agency review. After receipt of notification that the EEOC or 
the Civil Rights Division, as appropriate, has resolved the complaint or 
charge, the agency shall promptly determine what further action by the 
agency is warranted. In reaching that determination, the agency shall 
give due weight to the findings and conclusions of the EEOC and to those 
of the Civil Rights Division, as applicable. If the agency proposes to 
take an action inconsistent with the EEOC's or the Civil Rights 
Division's findings and conclusions as to whether a violation has 
occurred, the agency shall notify in writing the Assistant Attorney 
General, the Chairman of the EEOC, and the head of the EEOC office that 
processed the complaint. In the written notification, the agency shall 
state the action that it

[[Page 755]]

proposes to take and the basis of its decision to take such action.
    (d) Provision of information. Upon written request, the EEOC or the 
Civil Rights Division shall provide the section 504 agency with any 
materials relating to its resolution of the charge, including its 
findings and conclusions, investigative reports and files, and any 
conciliation agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 37.11  EEOC review of deferred charges.

    (a) Deferral by the EEOC. When it is determined that a section 504 
agency is the agency that shall process a dual-filed complaint or charge 
under Sec. 37.8(a)(2) or Sec. 37.8(e), the EEOC shall defer further 
action until the section 504 agency takes one of the following actions:
    (1) Makes a finding that a violation has not occurred;
    (2) Enters into a voluntary compliance agreement;
    (3) Following a finding that a violation has occurred, refers the 
complaint to the Civil Rights Division for judicial enforcement and the 
Civil Rights Division resolves the complaint;
    (4) Following a finding that a violation has occurred, resolves the 
complaint through final administrative enforcement action; or
    (5) Otherwise resolves the charge.
    (b) Notification of the EEOC. The section 504 agency shall notify 
the EEOC upon resolution of any dual-filed complaint or charge.
    (c) Agency review. After receipt of notification that the section 
504 agency has resolved the complaint, the EEOC shall promptly determine 
what further action by the EEOC is warranted. In reaching that 
determination, the EEOC shall give due weight to the section 504 
agency's findings and conclusions. If the EEOC proposes to take an 
action inconsistent with the section 504 agency's findings and 
conclusions as to whether a violation has occurred, the EEOC shall 
notify in writing the Assistant Attorney General, the Chairman of the 
EEOC, and the head of the section 504 agency that processed the 
complaint. In the written notification, the EEOC shall state the action 
that it proposes to take and the basis of its decision to take such 
action.
    (d) Provision of information. Upon written request, the section 504 
agency shall provide the EEOC with any materials relating to its 
resolution of the complaint, including its conclusions, investigative 
reports and files, and any voluntary compliance agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 37.12  Standards.

    In any investigation, compliance review, hearing or other 
proceeding, the standards used to determine whether section 504 has been 
violated in a complaint alleging employment discrimination shall be the 
standards applied under title I of the ADA and the provisions of 
sections 501 through 504, and 510, of the ADA, as such sections relate 
to employment. Section 504 agencies shall consider the regulations and 
appendix implementing title I of the ADA, set forth at 29 CFR part 1630, 
and case law arising under such regulations, in determining whether a 
recipient of Federal financial assistance has engaged in an unlawful 
employment practice.


<R05>
Sec. 37.13  Agency specific memoranda of understanding.

    When a section 504 agency amends its regulations to make them 
consistent with title I of the ADA, the EEOC and the individual section 
504 agency may elect to enter into a memorandum of understanding 
providing for the investigation and processing of complaints dual filed 
under both section 504 and title I of the ADA by the section 504 agency.

<R05>
Sec. 38.1  Discretionary grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements.

    (a) Religious organizations are eligible, on the same basis as any 
other organization, to participate in any Department program for which 
they are otherwise eligible. Neither the Department nor any State or 
local government receiving funds under any Department program shall, in 
the selection of service providers, discriminate for or against an 
organization on the basis of the organization's religious character or 
affiliation. As used in this section, ``program'' refers to a grant, 
contract, or cooperative agreement funded by a discretionary grant from 
the Department. As used in this section, the term ``grantee'' includes a 
recipient of a grant, a signatory to a cooperative agreement, or a 
contracting party.
    (b) (1) Organizations that receive direct financial assistance from 
the Department under any Department program may not engage in inherently 
religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, or 
proselytization, as part of the programs or services funded with direct 
financial assistance from the Department. If an organization conducts 
such activities, the activities must be offered separately, in time or 
location, from the programs or services funded with direct financial 
assistance from the Department, and participation must be voluntary for 
beneficiaries of the programs or services funded with such assistance.
    (2) The restrictions on inherently religious activities set forth in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section do not apply to programs where 
Department funds are provided to chaplains to work with inmates in 
prisons, detention facilities, or community correction centers, or where 
Department funds are provided to religious or other organizations for 
programs in prisons, detention facilities, or community correction 
centers, in which such organizations assist chaplains in carrying out 
their duties.
    (c) A religious organization that participates in the Department-
funded programs or services will retain its independence from Federal, 
State, and local governments, and may continue to carry out its mission, 
including the definition, practice, and expression of its religious 
beliefs, provided that it does not use direct financial assistance from 
the Department to support any inherently religious activities, such as 
worship, religious instruction, or proselytization. Among other things, 
a faith-based organization that receives financial assistance from the 
Department may use space in its facilities, without removing religious 
art, icons, scriptures, or other religious symbols. In addition, a 
religious organization that receives financial assistance from the 
Department retains its authority over its internal governance, and it 
may retain religious terms in its organization's name, select its board 
members on a religious basis, and include religious references in its 
organization's mission statements and other governing documents.
    (d) An organization that participates in programs funded by direct 
financial assistance from the Department shall not, in providing 
services, discriminate against a program beneficiary or prospective 
program beneficiary on the basis of religion or religious belief.
    (e) No grant document, agreement, covenant, memorandum of 
understanding, policy, or regulation that is used by the Department or a 
State or local government in administering financial assistance from the 
Department shall require only religious organizations to provide 
assurances that they will not use monies or property for inherently 
religious activities. Any such restrictions shall apply equally to 
religious and non-religious organizations. All organizations that 
participate in Department programs, including religious ones, must carry 
out eligible activities in accordance with all program requirements and 
other applicable requirements governing the conduct of Department-funded 
activities, including those prohibiting the use of direct financial 
assistance from the Department to engage in inherently religious 
activities. No grant document, agreement, covenant, memorandum of 
understanding, policy, or regulation that is used by the Department or a 
State or local government in administering financial assistance from the 
Department shall disqualify religious organizations from participating 
in the Department's programs because such

[[Page 757]]

organizations are motivated or influenced by religious faith to provide 
social services, or because of their religious character or affiliation.
    (f) Exemption from Title VII employment discrimination requirements. 
A religious organization's exemption from the Federal prohibition on 
employment discrimination on the basis of religion, set forth in section 
702(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-1, is not 
forfeited when the organization receives direct or indirect financial 
assistance from the Department. Some Department programs, however, 
contain independent statutory provisions requiring that all grantees 
agree not to discriminate in employment on the basis of religion. 
Accordingly, grantees should consult with the appropriate Department 
program office to determine the scope of any applicable requirements.
    (g) In general, the Department does not require that a grantee, 
including a religious organization, obtain tax-exempt status under 
section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code to be eligible for 
funding under Department programs. Many grant programs, however, do 
require an organization to be a ``nonprofit organization'' in order to 
be eligible for funding. Individual solicitations that require 
organizations to have nonprofit status will specifically so indicate in 
the eligibility section of a solicitation. In addition, any solicitation 
that requires an organization to maintain tax-exempt status will 
expressly state the statutory authority for requiring such status. 
Grantees should consult with the appropriate Department program office 
to determine the scope of any applicable requirements. In Department 
programs in which an applicant must show that it is a nonprofit 
organization, the applicant may do so by any of the following means:
    (1) Proof that the Internal Revenue Service currently recognizes the 
applicant as an organization to which contributions are tax deductible 
under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code;
    (2) A statement from a State taxing body or the State secretary of 
state certifying that:
    (i) The organization is a nonprofit organization operating within 
the State; and
    (ii) No part of its net earnings may lawfully benefit any private 
shareholder or individual;
    (3) A certified copy of the applicant's certificate of incorporation 
or similar document that clearly establishes the nonprofit status of the 
applicant; or
    (4) Any item described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this 
section if that item applies to a State or national parent organization, 
together with a statement by the State or parent organization that the 
applicant is a local nonprofit affiliate.
    (h) Effect on State and local funds. If a State or local government 
voluntarily contributes its own funds to supplement activities carried 
out under the applicable programs, the State or local government has the 
option to separate out the Federal funds or commingle them. If the funds 
are commingled, the provisions of this section shall apply to all of the 
commingled funds in the same manner, and to the same extent, as the 
provisions apply to the Federal funds.
    (i) To the extent otherwise permitted by Federal law, the 
restrictions on inherently religious activities set forth in this 
section do not apply where Department funds are provided to religious 
organizations as a result of a genuine and independent private choice of 
a beneficiary, provided the religious organizations otherwise satisfy 
the requirements of the program. A religious organization may receive 
such funds as the result of a beneficiary's genuine and independent 
choice if, for example, a beneficiary redeems a voucher, coupon, or 
certificate, allowing the beneficiary to direct where funds are to be 
paid, or a similar funding mechanism provided to that beneficiary and 
designed to give that beneficiary a choice among providers.


<R05>
Sec. 38.2  Formula grants.

    (a) Religious organizations are eligible, on the same basis as any 
other organization, to participate in any Department program for which 
they are

[[Page 758]]

otherwise eligible. Neither the Department nor any State or local 
government receiving funds under any Department program shall, in the 
selection of service providers, discriminate for or against an 
organization on the basis of the organization's religious character or 
affiliation. As used in this section, ``program'' refers to a grant, 
contract, or cooperative agreement funded by a formula or block grant 
from the Department. As used in this section, the term ``grantee'' 
includes a recipient of a grant, a signatory to a cooperative agreement, 
or a contracting party.
    (b) (1) Organizations that receive direct financial assistance from 
the Department may not engage in inherently religious activities, such 
as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization, as part of the 
programs or services funded with direct financial assistance from the 
Department. If an organization conducts such activities, the activities 
must be offered separately, in time or location, from the programs or 
services funded with direct financial assistance from the Department, 
and participation must be voluntary for beneficiaries of the programs or 
services funded with such assistance.
    (2) The restrictions on inherently religious activities set forth in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section do not apply to programs where 
Department funds are provided to chaplains to work with inmates in 
prisons, detention facilities, or community correction centers, or where 
Department funds are provided to religious or other organizations for 
programs in prisons, detention facilities, or community correction 
centers, in which such organizations assist chaplains in carrying out 
their duties.
    (c) A religious organization that participates in the Department-
funded programs or services will retain its independence from Federal, 
State, and local governments, and may continue to carry out its mission, 
including the definition, practice, and expression of its religious 
beliefs, provided that it does not use direct financial assistance from 
the Department to support any inherently religious activities, such as 
worship, religious instruction, or proselytization. Among other things, 
a faith-based organization that receives financial assistance from the 
Department may use space in its facilities, without removing religious 
art, icons, scriptures, or other religious symbols. In addition, a 
religious organization that receives financial assistance from the 
Department retains its authority over its internal governance, and it 
may retain religious terms in its organization's name, select its board 
members on a religious basis, and include religious references in its 
organization's mission statements and other governing documents.
    (d) An organization that participates in programs funded by direct 
financial assistance from the Department shall not, in providing 
services, discriminate against a program beneficiary or prospective 
program beneficiary on the basis of religion or religious belief.
    (e) No grant document, agreement, covenant, memorandum of 
understanding, policy, or regulation that is used by the Department or a 
State or local government in administering financial assistance from the 
Department shall require only religious organizations to provide 
assurances that they will not use monies or property for inherently 
religious activities. Any such restrictions shall apply equally to 
religious and non-religious organizations. All organizations that 
participate in Department programs, including religious ones, must carry 
out eligible activities in accordance with all program requirements and 
other applicable requirements governing the conduct of Department-funded 
activities, including those prohibiting the use of direct financial 
assistance to engage in inherently religious activities. No grant 
document, agreement, covenant, memorandum of understanding, policy, or 
regulation that is used by the Department or a State or local government 
in administering financial assistance from the Department shall 
disqualify religious organizations from participating in the 
Department's programs because such organizations are motivated or 
influenced by religious faith to provide social services, or because of 
their religious character or affiliation.
    (f) Exemption from Title VII employment discrimination requirements. 
A religious organization's exemption from

[[Page 759]]

the Federal prohibition on employment discrimination on the basis of 
religion, set forth in section 702(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 
42 U.S.C. 2000e-1, is not forfeited when the religious organization 
receives direct or indirect financial assistance from Department. Some 
Department programs, however, contain independent statutory provisions 
requiring that all grantees agree not to discriminate in employment on 
the basis of religion. Accordingly, grantees should consult with the 
appropriate Department program office to determine the scope of any 
applicable requirements.
    (g) In general, the Department does not require that a grantee, 
including a religious organization, obtain tax-exempt status under 
section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code to be eligible for 
funding under Department programs. Many grant programs, however, do 
require an organization to be a ``nonprofit organization'' in order to 
be eligible for funding. Individual solicitations that require 
organizations to have nonprofit status will specifically so indicate in 
the eligibility section of a solicitation. In addition, any solicitation 
that requires an organization to maintain tax-exempt status will 
expressly state the statutory authority for requiring such status. 
Grantees should consult with the appropriate Department program office 
to determine the scope of any applicable requirements. In Department 
programs in which an applicant must show that it is a nonprofit 
organization, the applicant may do so by any of the following means:
    (1) Proof that the Internal Revenue Service currently recognizes the 
applicant as an organization to which contributions are tax deductible 
under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code;
    (2) A statement from a State taxing body or the State secretary of 
state certifying that:
    (i) The organization is a nonprofit organization operating within 
the State; and
    (ii) No part of its net earnings may lawfully benefit any private 
shareholder or individual;
    (3) A certified copy of the applicant's certificate of incorporation 
or similar document that clearly establishes the nonprofit status of the 
applicant; or
    (4) Any item described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this 
section if that item applies to a State or national parent organization, 
together with a statement by the State or parent organization that the 
applicant is a local nonprofit affiliate.
    (h) Effect on State and local funds. If a State or local government 
voluntarily contributes its own funds to supplement activities carried 
out under the applicable programs, the State or local government has the 
option to separate out the Federal funds or commingle them. If the funds 
are commingled, the provisions of this section shall apply to all of the 
commingled funds in the same manner, and to the same extent, as the 
provisions apply to the Federal funds.
    (i) To the extent otherwise permitted by Federal law, the 
restrictions on inherently religious activities set forth in this 
section do not apply where Department funds are provided to religious 
organizations as a result of a genuine and independent private choice of 
a beneficiary, provided the religious organizations otherwise satisfy 
the requirements of the program. A religious organization may receive 
such funds as the result of a beneficiary's genuine and independent 
choice if, for example, a beneficiary redeems a voucher, coupon, or 
certificate, allowing the beneficiary to direct where funds are to be 
paid, or a similar funding mechanism provided to that beneficiary and 
designed to give that beneficiary a choice among providers.

<R05>
Sec. Sec. 39.141-39.148  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 39.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 39.150, no qualified 
handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 39.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does 
not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;
    (2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 39.150(a) would result in such 
alterations or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in 
such alteration or burdens must be made by the Attorney General or his 
or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use 
in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and 
must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching 
that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or 
activity.
    (b) Methods. The agency may comply with the requirements of this 
section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of 
services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, 
home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, 
alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, 
use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in 
making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural 
changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in 
achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making 
alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements 
to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as 
amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In 
choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this 
section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer 
programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most 
integrated setting appropriate.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by December 10, 1984, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by October 11, 1987, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by April 11, 1985, a transition plan setting forth 
the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide 
an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or 
organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the 
development of the transition by submitting comments (both oral and 
written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for 
public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped 
persons;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;

[[Page 764]]

    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 39.151  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the 
Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 
CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. Sec. 39.152-39.159  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 39.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
handicapped person.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 39.160 would result 
in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result 
in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Attorney General or 
his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for 
use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, 
and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for 
reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this 
section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency 
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration 
or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum 
extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services 
of the program or activity.

alleged act of discrimination, except that complaints by inmates of 
Federal penal institutions shall be filed within 180 days of the final 
administrative decision of the Bureau of Prisons under 28 CFR part 542. 
The Official may extend this time limit for good cause shown. For 
purposes of determining when a complaint is timely filed under this 
subparagraph, a complaint mailed to the agency shall be deemed filed on

the date it is received by the agency.
    (4) How to file. Complaints may be delivered or mailed to the

shall delete the identity of the complainant from the copy of the 
complaint.
    (f) Acceptance of complaint. (1) The Official shall accept a 
complete complaint that is filed in accordance with paragraph (d) of 
this section and over which the agency has jurisdiction. The Official 
shall notify the complainant and the respondent of receipt and 
acceptance of the complaint.
    (2) If the Official receives a complaint that is not complete, he or 
she shall notify the complainant, within 30 days of receipt of the 
incomplete complaint, that additional information is needed. If the 
complainant fails to complete the complaint within 30 days of receipt of 
this notice, the Official shall dismiss the complaint without prejudice.
    (3) If the Official receives a complaint over which the agency does 
not have jurisdiction, the Official shall promptly notify the 
complainant and shall make reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to 
the appropriate Government entity.
    (g) Investigation/conciliation. (1) Within 180 days of the receipt 
of a complete complaint, the Official shall complete the investigation 
of the complaint, attempt informal resolution, and, if no informal 
resolution is achieved, issue a letter of findings.
    (2) The Official may require agency employees to cooperate in the 
investigation and attempted resolution of complaints. Employees who are 
required by the Official to participate in any investigation under this 
section shall do so as part of their official duties and during the

file, with a copy of the agreement provided to the complainant and 
respondent. The written agreement may include a finding on the issue of 
discrimination and shall describe any corrective action to which the 
complainant and respondent have agreed.
    (h) Letter of findings. If an informal resolution of the complaint 
is not reached, the Official shall, within 180 days of receipt of the 
complete complaint, notify the complainant and the respondent of the 
results of the investigation in a letter sent by certified mail, return 
receipt requested, containing--
    (1) Findings of fact and conclusions of law;

hearing was filed, whichever is later.
    (3) If no party requests a hearing, the Responsible Official shall 
promptly transmit the notice of appeal and investigative record to the 
Complaint Adjudication Officer.
    (4) If neither party files an appeal within the time prescribed in 
paragraph (i)(1) of this section, the Responsible Official shall certify 
that the letter of findings is the final agency decision on the 
complaint at the expiration of that time.
    (j) Acceptance of appeal. The Responsible Official shall accept and 
process any timely appeal. A party may appeal to the Complaint 
Adjudication Officer from a decision of the Official that an appeal is 
untimely. This appeal shall be filed within 15 days of receipt of the 
decision from the Official.
    (k) Hearing. (1) Upon a timely request for a hearing, the 
Responsible Official shall appoint an administrative law judge to 
conduct the hearing. The administrative law judge shall issue a notice 
to all parties specifying the date, time, and place of the scheduled 
hearing. The hearing shall be commenced no earlier than 15 days after 
the notice is issued and no later than 60 days after the request for a 
hearing is filed, unless all parties agree to a different date.
    (2) The complainant and respondent shall be parties to the hearing. 
Any interested person or organization may petition to become a party or 
amicus curiae. The administrative law judge may, in his or her 
discretion, grant such a petition if, in his or her opinion, the 
petitioner has a legitimate interest in the proceedings and the 
participation will not unduly delay the outcome and may contribute 
materially to the proper disposition of the proceedings.
    (3) The hearing, decision, and any administrative review thereof 
shall be conducted in conformity with 5 U.S.C. 554-557 (sections 5-8 of 
the Administrative Procedure Act). The administrative law judge shall 
have the duty to conduct a fair hearing, to take all necessary action to 
avoid delay, and to maintain order. He or she shall have all powers 
necessary to these ends, including (but not limited to) the power to--
    (i) Arrange and change the date, time, and place of hearings and 
prehearing conferences and issue notice thereof;
    (ii) Hold conferences to settle, simplify, or determine the issues 
in a hearing, or to consider other matters that

[[Page 767]]

may aid in the expeditious disposition of the hearing;
    (iii) Require parties to state their position in writing with 
respect to the various issues in the hearing and to exchange such 
statements with all other parties;
    (iv) Examine witnesses and direct witnesses to testify;
    (v) Receive, rule on, exclude, or limit evidence;
    (vi) Rule on procedural items pending before him or her; and
    (vii) Take any action permitted to the administrative law judge as 
authorized by this part or by the provisions of the Administrative 
Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551-559).
    (4) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings 
conducted pursuant to this paragraph, but rules or principles designed 
to assure production of credible evidence and to subject testimony to 
cross-examination shall be applied by the administrative law judge 
whenever reasonably necessary. The administrative law judge may exclude 
irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents 
and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to 
examination by the parties, and opportunity shall be given to refute 
facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript 
shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance 
thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon 
the hearing record.
    (5) The costs and expenses for the conduct of a hearing shall be 
allocated as follows:
    (i) Persons employed by the agency, shall, upon request to the 
agency by the administrative law judge, be made available to participate 
in the hearing and shall be on official duty status for this purpose. 
They shall not receive witness fees.
    (ii) Employees of other Federal agencies called to testify at a 
hearing shall, at the request of the administrative law judge and with 
the approval of the employing agency, be on official duty status during 
any period of absence from normal duties caused by their testimony, and 
shall not receive witness fees.
    (iii) The fees and expenses of other persons called to testify at a 
hearing shall be paid by the party requesting their appearance.
    (iv) The administrative law judge may require the agency to pay 
travel expenses necessary for the complainant to attend the hearing.
    (v) The respondent shall pay the required expenses and charges for 
the administrative law judge and court reporter.
    (vi) All other expenses shall be paid by the party, the intervening 
party, or amicus curiae incurring them.
    (6) The administrative law judge shall submit in writing recommended 
findings of fact, conclusions of law, and remedies to all parties and 
the Complaint Adjudication Officer within 30 days after receipt of the 
hearing transcripts, or within 30 days after the conclusion of the 
hearing if no transcript is made. This time limit may be extended with 
the permission of the Complaint Adjudication Officer.
    (7) Within 15 days after receipt of the recommended decision of the 
administrative law judge, any party may file exceptions to the decision 
with the Complaint Adjudication Officer. Thereafter, each party will 
have ten days to file reply exceptions with the Officer.
    (l) Decision. (1) The Complaint Adjudication Officer shall make the 
decision of the agency based on information in the investigative record 
and, if a hearing is held, on the hearing record. The decision shall be 
made within 60 days of receipt of the transmittal of the notice of 
appeal and investigative record pursuant to Sec. 39.170(i)(3) or after 
the period for filing exceptions ends, whichever is applicable. If the 
Complaint Adjudication Officer determines that he or she needs 
additional information from any party, he or she shall request the 
information and provide the other party or parties an opportunity to 
respond to that information. The Complaint Adjudication Officer shall 
have 60 days from receipt of the additional information to render the 
decision on the appeal. The Complaint Adjudication Officer shall 
transmit his or her decision by letter to the parties. The decision 
shall set forth the findings, remedial action required, and reasons for 
the decision. If

[[Page 768]]

the decision is based on a hearing record, the Complaint Adjudication 
Officer shall consider the recommended decision of the administrative 
law judge and render a final decision based on the entire record. The 
Complaint Adjudication Officer may also remand the hearing record to the 
administrative law judge for a fuller development of the record.
    (2) Any respondent required to take action under the terms of the 
decision of the agency shall do so promptly. The Official may require 
periodic compliance reports specifying--
    (i) The manner in which compliance with the provisions of the 
decision has been achieved;
    (ii) The reasons any action required by the final decision has not 
yet been taken; and
    (iii) The steps being taken to ensure full compliance.

The Complaint Adjudication Officer may retain responsibility for 
resolving disagreements that arise between the parties over 
interpretation of the final agency decision, or for specific 
adjudicatory decisions arising out of implementation.

    Editorial Note: For the convenience of the user, the ``Supplementary 
Information'' portion of the document published at 49 FR 35724, Sept. 
11, 1984, is set forth below:


SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 16, 1983, the Department of 
Justice published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for the 
enforcement of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as 
amended, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of handicap, as it 
applies to programs and activities conducted by the Department of 
Justice. 48 FR 55996. Shortly after the NPRM was published, the 
Department received a number of preliminary comments from handicapped 
individuals and from organizations representing handicapped individuals. 
The tone and nature of these comments indicated to the Department that 
some of the regulatory provisions of the NPRM were being misunderstood. 
As a result, the Department, on March 1, 1984, published a Supplementary 
Notice further explaining the NPRM and requesting comments on possible 
revisions to the original NPRM. 49 FR 7792.

    By April 16, 1984, close of the comment period, the Department 
received 1,194 comments. Two hundred and six of these comments also 
addressed the supplemental notice. Over 90% of the comments that the 
Department received came from individuals (908), most frequently 
handicapped persons, and from organizations representing the interests 
of handicapped persons (180). The Department received comments from all 
fifty states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Canada, and 
Denmark. Most of the comments that the Department received were general 
in nature. The Department received 721 comments based on a form letter. 
This form letter, written before issuance of the Supplemental Notice, 
expressed dismay at the inclusion of the regulation's ``undue financial 
and administrative burdens'' language, asserted that the Department was 
imposing a lesser requirement on the Federal government than on 
recipients of Federal assistance, and requested that the regulation be 
withdrawn. This form letter did not contain any substantive or detailed 
analysis. In fact, only 55 of the 1,194 comments contained specific, 
detailed analysis of the Department's proposal.

    The Department read and analyzed each comment. Each comment was then 
subdivided according to one or more of over 90 issue categories. Because 
comments often addressed, even in general terms, more than one issue, 
the 1,194 comments were translated into 4,256 issue-specific comments. 
The decisions that the Department made in response to these comments, 
however, were not made on the basis of the number of commenters 
addressing any one point but on a thorough consideration of the merits 
of the points of view expressed in the comments. Copies of the written 
comments will remain available for public inspection in Room 854 of the 
HOLC Building, 320 First Street, NW., Washington, DC from 9:00 a.m. to 
5:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except for legal holidays, until 
November 13, 1984.

    Section 504 requires that regulations that apply to the programs and 
activities of Federal executive agencies shall be submitted to the 
appropriate authorizing committees of Congress and that such regulations 
may take effect no earlier than the thirtieth day after they have been 
so submitted. The Department has today submitted this regulation to the 
Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources and its Subcommittee on 
the Handicapped and the House Committee on Education and Labor and its 
Subcommittee on Select Education pursuant to the terms of section 504. 
The regulation will become effective on October 11, 1984.

    This rule applies to all programs and activities conducted by the 
Department of Justice. Thus, this rule regulates the activities of over 
30 separate subunits in the Department, including, for example, the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, 
the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Bureau of Prisons, 
Federal Prison Industries, and the United States Attorneys.


[[Page 769]]



Background


    The purpose of this rule is to provide for the enforcement of 
section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 
794), as it applies to programs and activities conducted by the 
Department of Justice (DOJ). As amended by the Rehabilitation, 
Comprehensive Services, and Developmental Disabilities Amendments of 
1978 (Sec. 119, Pub. L. 95-602, 92 Stat. 2982), section 504 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 states that:


    No otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States, 
. . . shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from the 
participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to 
discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial 
assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any Executive 
agency or by the United States Postal Service. The head of each such 
agency shall promulgate such regulations as may be necessary to carry 
out the amendments to this section made by the Rehabilitation, 
Comprehensive Services, and Developmental Disabilities Act of 1978. 
Copies of any proposed regulation shall be submitted to appropriate 
authorizing committees of the Congress, and such regulation may take 
effect no earlier than the thirtieth day after the date on which such 
regulation is so submitted to such committees.


(29 U.S.C. 794) (amendment italicized).


    The substantive nondiscrimination obligations of the agency, as set 
forth in this rule, are identical, for the most part, to those 
established by Federal regulations for programs or activities receiving 
Federal financial assistance. See 28 CFR part 41 (section 504 
coordination regulation for federally assisted programs). This general 
parallelism is in accord with the intent expressed by supporters of the 
1978 amendment in floor debate, including its sponsor, Rep. James M. 
Jeffords, that the Federal government should have the same section 504 
obligations as recipients of Federal financial assistance. 124 Cong. 
Rec. 13,901 (1978) (remarks of Rep. Jeffords); 124 Cong. Rec. E2668, 
E2670 (daily ed. May 17, 1984) id., 124 Cong. Rec. 13,897 (remarks of 
Rep. Brademas); id. at 38,552 (remarks of Rep. Sarasin).

    Nine hundred and two comments that the Department received agreed 
that the obligations of section 504 for federally conducted programs 
should be identical to those developed by the Federal agencies over the 
past seven years for federally assisted programs. These commenters, 
however, objected to any language differences between the Department's 
proposed rule for federally conducted programs and the Department's 
section 504 coordination regulation for federally assisted programs (28 
CFR part 41). The commenters asserted that a number of language 
differences that the Department had proposed created less stringent 
standards for the Federal government than those applied to recipients of 
Federal assistance under section 504. They wrote that such a result 
could not be justified by Executive Order 12250, by the wording of the 
statute itself, nor by the legislative history of the 1978 amendments.

    The commenters appear to have misunderstood the basis for inclusion 
of the new language in the DOJ regulation. The changes in this 
regulation are based on the Supreme Court's decision in Southeastern 
Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397 (1979), and the subsequent 
circuit court decisions interpreting Davis and section 504. See Dopico 
v. Goldschmidt, 687 F.2d 644 (2d Cir. 1982); American Public Transit 
Association v. Lewis, 655 F.2d 1272 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (APTA); see also 
Rhode Island Handicapped Action Committee v. Rhode Island Public Transit 
Authority, 718 F.2d 490 (1st Cir. 1983).

    Some commenters questioned the use of Davis as justification for the 
inclusion of the new provisions in the federally conducted regulation. 
They noted that the Department had not included these changes when, 
subsequent to the Davis decision, it issued a regulation implementing 
section 504 in programs receiving Federal financial assistance from this 
Department. The Department's section 504 federally assisted regulation, 
however, was issued prior to the D.C. circuit's decision in APTA. In 
APTA, the Department had argued a position similar to that advocated by 
the commenters. Judge Abner Mikva's decision in APTA clearly rejected 
the Department's position in that case. Other circuit court decisions 
followed the APTA interpretation of Davis. Since these decisions, the 
Department has interpreted its section 504 regulation for federally 
assisted programs in a manner consistent with the language of this final 
rule. The Department believes that judicial interpretation of section 
504 compels it to incorporate the new language in the federally 
conducted regulation.

    Incorporation of these changes, therefore, makes this section 504 
federally conducted regulation consistent with the Federal government's 
section 504 federally assisted regulations. Because many of these 
federally assisted regulations were issued prior to the judicial 
interpretations of Davis and its progeny, their language does not 
reflect the interpretation of section 504 provided by the Supreme Court 
and by the various circuit courts. Of course, these federally assisted 
regulations must be interpreted to reflect the holdings of the Federal 
judiciary. Hence the Department believes that there are no significant 
differences between this final rule for federally conducted programs and 
the Federal government's interpretation of section 504 regulations for 
federally assisted programs.

    This regulation has been reviewed by the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission under Executive Order 12067 (43 FR 28967, 3 CFR, 
1978 Comp., p. 206). It is not a major rule within the meaning of 
Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 13193, 3 CFR, 1981 Comp., p. 127) and, 
therefore, a regulatory impact analysis has not been prepared. This 
regulation does not have an impact on small entities. It is not, 
therefore, subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612).


Section-by-Section Analysis and Response to Comments


Section 39.101 Purpose


    Section 39.101 states the purpose of the rule, which is to 
effectuate section 119 of the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, 
and Developmental Disabilities Amendments of 1978, which amended section 
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to prohibit discrimination on the 
basis of handicap in programs or activities conducted by Executive 
agencies or the United States Postal Service.

    The Department received no comments on this section and it remains 
unchanged from the Department's proposed rule.


Section 39.102 Application


    The regulation applies to all programs or activities conducted by 
the Department of Justice. Under this section, a federally conducted 
program or activity is, in simple terms, anything a Federal agency does. 
Aside from employment, there are two major categories of federally 
conducted programs or activities covered by this regulation: those 
involving general public contact as part of ongoing agency operations 
and those directly administered by the Department for program 
beneficiaries and participants. Activities in the first part include 
communication with the public (telephone contacts, office walk-ins, or 
interviews) and the public's use of the Department's facilities 
(cafeteria, library). Activities in the second category include programs 
that provide Federal services or benefits (immigration activities, 
operation of the Federal prison system). No comments were received on 
this section.


Section 39.103 Definitions


    The Department received 469 comments on the definitions section. 
Most of the comment, however, concentrated on the definition of 
``qualified handicapped person.''

    ``Agency'' is defined as the Department of Justice.

    ``Assistant Attorney General.'' ``Assistant Attorney General'' 
refers to the Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division, United 
States Department of Justice.

    ``Auxiliary aids.'' ``Auxiliary aids'' means services or devices 
that enable persons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills to 
have an equal opportunity to participate in and enjoy the benefits of 
the agency's programs or activities. The definition provides examples of 
commonly used auxiliary aids. Auxiliary aids are addressed in Sec. 
39.160(a)(1). Comments on the definition of ``auxiliary aids'' are 
discussed in connection with that section.

    ``Complete complaint.'' ``Complete complaint'' is defined to include 
all the information necessary to enable the agency to investigate the 
complaint. The definition is necessary, because the 180 day period for 
the agency's investigation (see Sec. 39.170(g)) begins when it receives 
a complete complaint.

    ``Facility.'' The definition of ``facility'' is similar to that in 
the section 504 coordination regulation for federally assisted programs, 
28 CFR 41.3(f), except that the term ``rolling stock or other 
conveyances'' has been added and the phrase ``or interest in such 
property'' has been deleted.

    Twenty commenters on the NPRM objected to the omission of the phrase 
``or interest in such property'' from the definition of ``facility.'' As 
explained in the Supplemental Notice, the term ``facility,'' as used in 
this regulation, refers to structures, and does not include intangible 
property rights. The definition, therefore, has no effect on the scope 
of coverage of programs, including those conducted in facilities not 
included in the definition. The phrase has been omitted because the 
requirement that facilities be accessible would be a logical absurdity 
if applied to a lease, life estate, mortgage, or other intangible 
property interest. The regulation applies to all programs and activities 
conducted by the agency regardless of whether the facility in which they 
are conducted is owned, leased, or used on some other basis by the 
agency. Sixty commenters supported the clarification of this issue in 
the Supplemental Notice.

    ``Handicapped person.'' The definition of ``handicapped person'' has 
been revised to make it identical to the definition appearing in the 
section 504 coordination regulation for federally assisted programs (28 
CFR 41.31). In its NPRM, the Department omitted the list of physical or 
mental impairments included in the definition of ``handicapped 
persons.'' The Department received 19 negative comments on this 
omission, and, in the Supplemental Notice, requested comments on whether 
it should be re-inserted. On the basis of the comments received, we have 
included the list in the final rule.

    ``Qualified handicapped person'' The definition of ``qualified 
handicapped person'' is a revised version of the definition appearing in 
the section 504 coordination regulation for federally assisted programs 
(28 CFR 41.32).

[[Page 771]]


    Subparagraph (1) of the definition states that a ``qualified 
handicapped person'' with regard to any program under which a person is 
required to perform services or to achieve a level of accomplishment is 
a handicapped person who can achieve the purpose of the program without 
modifications in the program that the agency can demonstrate would 
result in a fundamental alteration in its nature. This definition is 
based on the Supreme Court's Davis decision.

    In Davis, the Court ruled that a hearing-impaired applicant to a 
nursing school was not a ``qualified handicapped person'' because her 
hearing impairment would prevent her from participating in the clinical 
training portion of the program. The Court found that, if the program 
were modified so as to enable the respondent to participate (by 
exempting her from the clinical training requirements), ``she would not 
receive even a rough equivalent of the training a nursing program 
normally gives.'' 442 U.S. at 410. It also found that ``the purpose of 
[the] program was to train persons who could serve the nursing 
profession in all customary ways,'' id. at 413, and that the respondent 
would be unable, because of her hearing impairment, to perform some 
functions expected of a registered nurse. It therefore concluded that 
the school was not required by section 504 to make such modifications 
that would result in ``a fundamental alteration in the nature of the 
program.'' Id. at 410.

    The Department incorporated the Court's language in the definition 
of ``qualified handicapped person'' in order to make clear that such a 
person must be able to participate in the program offered by the agency. 
The agency is required to make modifications in order to enable a 
handicapped applicant to participate, but is not required to offer a 
program of a fundamentally different nature. The test is whether, with 
appropriate modifications, the applicant can achieve the purpose of the 
program offered; not whether the applicant could benefit or obtain 
results from some other program that the agency does not offer. Although 
the revised definition allows exclusion of some handicapped people from 
some programs, it requires that a handicapped person who is capable of 
achieving the purpose of the program must be accommodated, provided that 
the modifications do not fundamentally alter the nature of the program.

    Two hundred and forty-four commenters objected to this revised 
definition for a variety of reasons. Several commenters stated that the 
Department incorrectly used Davis as the justification for explaining 
the differences between the federally assisted and the federally 
conducted regulations because the Supreme Court upheld the validity of 
the existing regulations in Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Darrone, 104 S. 
Ct. 1248 (1984). This view misunderstands the Court's actions in 
Darrone. In that case the Court ruled on a series of issues, the most 
important of which was under what circumstances section 504 applied to 
employment discrimination by recipients. The Court did not concern 
itself either directly or indirectly with the definition of ``qualified 
handicapped person'' or whether section 504 included limitations based 
on ``undue financial and administrative burdens.''

    Many commenters stated that the proposal would change the definition 
of qualified handicapped person for employment. ``Qualified handicapped 
person'' is defined for purposes of employment in 29 CFR 1613.702(f), 
which is made applicable to this part by Sec. 39.140. Nothing in this 
part changes existing regulations applicable to employment.

    Many commenters assumed that the definition would have the effect of 
placing on the handicapped person the burden of proving that he or she 
is qualified. The definition has been revised to make it clear that the 
agency has the burden of demonstrating that a proposed modification 
would constitute a fundamental alteration in the nature of its program 
or activity. Furthermore, in demonstrating that a modification would 
result in such an alteration, the agency must follow the procedures 
established in Sec. Sec. 39.150(a)(2) and 39.160(d), which are 
discussed below, for demonstrating that an action would result in undue 
financial and administrative burdens. That is, the decision must be made 
by the agency head or his or her designee in writing after consideration 
of all resources available for the program or activity and must be 
accompanied by an explanation of the reasons for the decision. If the 
agency head determines that an action would result in a fundamental 
alteration, the agency must consider options that would enable the 
handicapped person to achieve the purpose of the program but would not 
result in such an alteration.

    Some commenters said that the definition of ``qualified handicapped 
person'' places handicapped persons in a ``Catch-22'' situation: because 
only qualified handicapped persons are protected by the statute, a 
determination that a person is not qualified would make enforcement 
remedies unavailable to that person. This concern is misplaced. If the 
Department determined that a handicapped person was not ``qualified,'' 
the person could use the procedures established by Sec. 39.170 to 
challenge that determination, just as he or she could challenge any 
other decision by the agency that he or she believed to be 
discriminatory.

    Many commenters argued that the definition of ``qualified 
handicapped person'' confused what should be two separate inquiries: 
whether a person meets essential eligibility

[[Page 772]]

requirements and, if so, whether accommodation is required. They argued 
that the reference to ``fundamental alteration'' in the definition 
focuses attention on accommodations rather than on a handicapped 
person's abilities. As another commenter noted, however, the Supreme 
Court in Davis developed the ``fundamental alteration'' language in a 
decision that was determining the nature and scope of what constitutes a 
qualified handicapped person. The Department continues to believe that 
the concept of ``qualified handicapped person'' properly encompasses 
both the notion of ``essential eligibility requirements'' and the notion 
of program modifications that might fundamentally alter a program.

    Some commenters argued that our analysis of Davis was inappropriate 
because Davis was decided on the basis of individual facts unique to 
that case or because Davis involved federally assisted and not federally 
conducted programs. While cases are decided on the basis of specific 
factual situations, courts, especially the Supreme Court, develop 
general principles of law for use in analyzing facts. The Davis decision 
was the Supreme Court's first comprehensive view of section 504, a major 
new civil rights statute. The Davis holding, that a person who cannot 
achieve the purpose of a program without fundamental changes in its 
nature is not a ``qualified handicapped person,'' is a general 
principle, a statement by the Court on how it views section 504. It is 
therefore necessary to reflect it in the Department's regulation.

    Subparagraph (2) of the definition adopts the existing definition in 
the coordination regulation of ``qualified handicapped person'' with 
respect to services for programs receiving Federal financial assistance 
(28 CFR 41.32(b)). Under this part of the definition, a qualified 
handicapped person is a handicapped person who meets the essential 
eligibility requirements for participation in the program or activity.

    ``Section 504.'' This definition makes clear that, as used in this 
regulation, ``section 504'' applies only to programs or activities 
conducted by the agency and not to programs or activities to which it 
provides Federal financial assistance.


Section 39.110 Self-evaluation


    This section requires that the agency conduct a self-evaluation of 
its compliance with section 504 within one year of the effective date of 
this regulation. The self-evaluation requirement is present in the 
existing section 504 coordination regulation for programs or activities 
receiving Federal financial assistance (28 CFR 41.5(b)(2)). Experience 
has demonstrated the self-evaluation process to be a valuable means of 
establishing a working relationship with handicapped persons that 
promotes both effective and efficient implementation of section 504.

    In response to preliminary comments that the proposed rule had no 
specific criteria for conducting a self-evaluation, we requested comment 
on a proposed alternative in our Supplemental Notice (49 FR 7792). We 
received 64 comments, 57 of which were positive. The comments generally 
favored adoption of the alternative section, instead of the proposed 
section. We agree.

    With respect to the applicability of the Federal Advisory Committee 
Act (5 U.S.C. App. 1 et seq.) (FACA), several comments were received. 
They argued that the FACA is not intended to apply to meetings with a 
self-evaluation group comprised of private individuals because they are 
rather unstructured, ad hoc meetings.

    Authority for interpreting FACA was delegated to the General 
Services Administration (GSA) by Executive Order 12024 in 1977. 
Regulations issued by GSA place specific limitations on the scope of the 
Act by delineating examples of meetings or groups not covered. 41 CFR 
part 101-6. GSA identified a major issue in the promulgation of the 
regulations to be the extent of applicability of the Act

    Some commenters believe, as a matter of general policy, that 
advisory groups which are not formally structured, which do not have a 
continuing existence, which meet to deal with specific issues, and whose 
meetings do not constitute an established pattern of conduct should not 
be covered under the Act. * * * This rule reflects our judgment that the 
exclusion of certain non-recurring meetings from the Act's coverage is 
fully consistent with the statute, its legislative history, and judicial 
interpretation. * * * The interim rule provides guidance for those 
meetings between Federal officials and non-Federal individuals which do

    (j) Any meeting initiated by a Federal official(s) with more than 
one individual for the purpose of obtaining the advice of individual 
attendees and not for the purpose of utilizing the group to obtain 
consensus advice or recommendations.

    This final rule provides that the agency shall provide an 
opportunity for interested persons, including handicapped persons or 
organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the 
self-evaluation process and development of transition plans by 
submitting comments (both oral and written).


Section 39.111 Notice


    The Department received negative comments on its omission of a 
paragraph routinely used in section 504 regulations for federally 
assisted programs requiring recipients to inform interested persons of 
their rights under section 504. In the Department's Supplemental Notice, 
we requested comments on inclusion of specific regulatory language. 
Fifty-four positive comments were received. As a result, the Department 
has incorporated that new provision on notice into the final rule. It 
appears as Sec. 39.111.

    Section 39.111 requires the agency to disseminate sufficient 
information to employees, applicants, participants, beneficiaries, and 
other interested persons to apprise them of rights and protections 
afforded by section 504 of this regulation. Methods of providing this 
information include, for example, the publication of information in 
handbooks, manuals, and pamphlets that are distributed to the public to 
describe the agency's programs and activities; the display of 
informative posters in service centers and other public places; or the 
broadcast of information by television or radio.

    Section 39.111 is, in fact, a broader and more detailed version of 
the proposed rule's requirement (at Sec. 39.160(d)) that the agency 
provide handicapped persons with information concerning their rights. 
Because Sec. 39.111 encompasses the requirements of proposed Sec. 
39.160(d), that latter paragraph has been deleted as duplicative.


Section 39.130 General prohibitions against discrimination


    Section 39.130 is an adaptation of the corresponding section of the 
section 504 coordination regulation for programs or activities receiving 
Federal financial assistance (28 CFR 41.51). This regulatory provision 
attracted relatively few public comments and has not been changed from 
the proposed rule.

    Paragraph (a) restates the nondiscrimination mandate of section 504. 
The remaining paragraphs in Sec. 39.130 establish the general 
principles for analyzing whether any particular action of the agency 
violates this mandate. These principles serve as the analytical 
foundation for the remaining sections of the regulation. If the agency 
violates a provision in any of the subsequent sections, it will also 
violate one of the general prohibitions found in Sec. 39.130. When 
there is no applicable subsequent provision, the general prohibitions 
stated in this section apply.

    Paragraph (b) prohibits overt denials of equal treatment of 
handicapped persons. The agency may not refuse to provide a handicapped 
person with an equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from its 
program simply because the person is handicapped. Such blatantly 
exclusionary practices often result from the use of irrebuttable 
presumptions that absolutely exclude certain classes of disabled persons 
(e.g., epileptics, hearing-impaired persons, persons with heart 
ailments) from participation in programs or activities without regard to 
an individual's actual ability to participate. Use of an irrebuttable 
presumption is permissible only when in all cases a physical condition 
by its very nature would prevent an individual from meeting the 
essential eligiblity requirements for participation in the activity in 
question. It would be permissible, therefore, to exclude without an 
individual evaluation all persons who are blind in both eyes from 
eligibility for a license to operate a commercial vehicle in interstate 
commerce; but it may not be permissible to disqualify automatically all 
those who are blind in just one eye.

[[Page 774]]


    In addition, section 504 prohibits more than just the most obvious 
denials of equal treatment. It is not enough to admit persons in 
wheelchairs to a program if the facilities in which the program is 
conducted are inaccessible. Subparagraph (b)(1)(iii), therefore, 
requires that the opportunity to participate or benefit afforded to a 
handicapped person be as effective as that afforded to others. The later 
sections on program accessibility (Sec. Sec. 39.149-39.151) and 
communications (Sec. 39.160) are specific applications of this 
principle.

    Despite the mandate of paragraph (d) that the agency administer its 
programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to 
the needs of qualified handicapped persons, subparagraph (b)(1)(iv), in 
conjunction with paragraph (d), permits the agency to develop separate 
or different aids, benefits, or services when necessary to provide 
handicapped persons with an equal opportunity to participate in or 
benefit from the agency's programs or activities. Subparagraph 
(b)(1)(iv) requires that different or separate aids, benefits, or 
services be provided only when necessary to ensure that the aids, 
benefits, or services are as effective as those provided to others. Even 
when separate or different aids, benefits, or services would be more 
effective, subparagraph (b)(2) provides that a qualified handicapped 
person still has the right to choose to participate in the program that 
is not designed to accommodate handicapped persons.

    Subparagraph (b)(1)(v) prohibits the agency from denying a qualified 
handicapped person the opportunity to participate as a member of a 
planning or advisory board.

    Subparagraph (b)(1)(vi) prohibits the agency from limiting a 
qualified handicapped person in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, 
advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving any aid, benefit, 
or service.

    Subparagraph (b)(3) prohibits the agency from utilizing criteria or 
methods of administration that deny handicapped persons access to the 
agency's programs or activities. The phrase ``criteria or methods of 
administration'' refers to official written agency policies and to the 
actual practices of the agency. This subparagraph prohibits both 
blatantly exclusionary policies or practices and nonessential policies 
and practices that are neutral on their face, but deny handicapped 
persons an effective opportunity to participate.

    Subparagraph (b)(4) specifically applies the prohibition enunciated 
in Sec. 39.130(b)(3) to the process of selecting sites for construction 
of new facilities or existing facilities to be used by the agency. 
Subparagraph (b)(4) does not apply to construction of additional 
buildings at an existing site.

    Subparagraph (b)(5) prohibits the agency, in the selection of 
procurement contractors, from using criteria that subject qualified 
handicapped persons to discrimination on the basis of handicap.

    Subparagraph (b)(6) prohibits the agency from discriminating against 
qualified handicapped persons on the basis of handicap in the granting 
of licenses or certification. A person is a ``qualified handicapped 
person'' with respect to licensing or certification, if he or she can 
meet the essential eligibility requirements for receiving the license or 
certification (see Sec. 39.103).

    In addition, the agency may not establish requirements for the 
programs or activities of licensees or certified entities that subject 
qualified handicapped persons to discrimination on the basis of 
handicap. For example, the agency must comply with this requirement when 
establishing safety standards for the operations of licensees. In that 
case the agency must ensure that standards that it promulgates do not 
discriminate in an impermissible manner against the employment of 
qualified handicapped persons.

    Subparagraph (b)(6) does not extend section 504 directly to the 
programs or activities of licensees or certified entities themselves. 
The programs or activities of Federal licensees or certified entities 
are not themselves federally conducted programs or activities nor are 
they programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance 
merely by virtue of the Federal license or certificate. However, as 
noted above, section 504 may affect the content of the rules established 
by the agency for the operation of the program or activity of the 
licensee or certified entity, and thereby indirectly affect limited 
aspects of its operations.

    Twenty-three commenters argued that the regulation should extend to 
the activities of licensees or certified entities, citing Community 
Television of Southern California v. Gottfried, 103 S. Ct. 885 (1983). 
In that case, the Court held that section 504 as applied to federally 
assisted programs did not require the Federal Communications Commission 
to prohibit discrimination on the basis of handicap by licensed 
broadcasters, but that ``the policies underlying the Communications 
Act'' might authorize the Commission to issue a regulation governing 
such discrimination. The Court did not, however, indicate that section 
504 itself could serve as the source of such regulatory authority.

    The Court has held that ``the use of the words `public interest' in 
a regulatory statute is not a broad license to promote the general 
public welfare. Rather the words take meaning from the purposes of the 
regulatory legislation.'' National Association for the Advancement of 
Colored People v. Federal Power Commission, 425 U.S. 662, 669 (1976). In 
our view, section 504 does not of itself extend an agency's regulatory 
authority to the activities of licensees or certified entities.

[[Page 775]]

Where an agency has existing regulatory authority that is broad enough 
to enable it to establish a nondiscrimination requirement for its 
licensees or certified entities, section 504 may support the exercise of 
that authority. Because the Department of Justice has no such underlying 
authority, it cannot prohibit discrimination by licensees.

    Twenty-two commenters objected to the omission of a paragraph from 
the regulations for federally assisted programs that prohibits a 
recipient from providing significant assistance to an organization that 
discriminates. To the extent that assistance from the agency would 
provide significant support to an organization, it would constitute 
Federal financial assistance and the organization, as a recipient of 
such assistance, would be covered by the agency's section 504 regulation 
for federally assisted programs. The regulatory ``significant 
assistance'' provision, however, would be inappropriate in a regulation 
applying only to federally conducted programs or activities.

    Paragraph (c) provides that programs conducted pursuant to Federal 
statute or Executive order that are designed to benefit only handicapped 
persons or a given class of handicapped persons may be limited to those 
handicapped persons.

    Paragraph (d), discussed above, provides that the agency must 
administer programs and activities in the most integrated setting 
appropriate to the needs of qualified handicapped persons.


Section 39.140 Employment


    Section 39.140 prohibits discrimination on the basis of handicap in 
employment by the agency. Comments on proposed Sec. 39.140 identified 
two types of problems. First, several commenters felt that the rule's 
treatment of employment was not sufficiently comprehensive. They pointed 
out that the rule does not enumerate the employment practices covered 
(e.g., hiring, promotion, assignment); it does not say what must be done 
to avoid or correct possible discrimination (e.g., reasonable 
accommodation, review of preemployment tests, limitations on 
preemployment inquiries and the use of medical examinations); nor does 
it define a ``qualified handicapped person'' with respect to employment.

    Second, one commenter objected to the rule's adoption of ``the 
definitions, requirements and procedures of section 501 of the 
Rehabilitation Act'' as established in rules of the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) at 29 CFR part 1613. This commenter argued 
that EEOC's rules on physical examinations were too restrictive and 
claimed that the proposed rule did not limit employment coverage to the 
program conducted by the Federal government in a manner similar to the 
``program or activity'' limitation on coverage of programs receiving 
Federal financial assistance. Finally, the commenter asserted that 
reliance on section 501 was misplaced because that section of the 
Rehabilitation Act requires affirmative action whereas section 504, 
which the rule implements, contains only a nondiscrimination 
requirement.

    The original notice of proposed rulemaking explained that the 
regulation is in accord with Prewitt v. United States Postal Service, 
662 F.2d 292 (5th Cir. 1981), which held that Congress intended section 
504 to cover the employment practices of Executive agencies. In Prewitt, 
the court also held that, in order to give effect to sections 501 and 
504, both of which cover Federal employment, the administrative 
procedures of section 501 must be followed. Accordingly, the proposed 
rule adopted the definitions, requirements and procedures of section 501 
as established in EEOC's rules.

    The final rule has not been changed. The Department intends to avoid 
duplicative, competing or conflicting standards under the Rehabilitation 
Act with respect to Federal employment. While the rule could define 
terms with respect to employment and enumerate what practices are 
covered and what requirements apply, reference to the Government-wide 
rules of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is sufficient and 
avoids duplication. The class of Federal employees and applicants for 
employment covered by section 504 is identical to or subsumed within 
that covered by section 501. To apply different or lesser standards to 
persons alleging violations of section 504 could lead unnecessarily to 
confusion in the enforcement of the Rehabilitation Act with respect to 
Federal employment.


Section 39.149 Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited


    The proposed regulation did not contain a general statement of the 
program accessibility requirement similar to that appearing in the 
section 504 coordination regulation for federally assisted programs (28 
CFR 41.56). The decision not to include this language in the proposed 
regulation created the misperception that a change in substance was 
intended. In order to remedy this misunderstanding, the Supplemental 
Notice requested comments on explicitly including it. Sixty-two 
commenters favored inclusion of the specific regulatory language that 
was published in the Supplemental Notice. Consequently, the final rule 
has been revised to include the language of the Supplemental Notice. The 
language appears at Sec. 39.149.


Section 39.150 Program accessibility: Existing facilities


[[Page 776]]



    This regulation adopts the program accessibility concept found in 
the existing section 504 coordination regulation for programs or 
activities receiving Federal financial assistance (28 CFR 41.57), with 
certain modifications. Thus, Sec. 39.150 requires that the agency's 
program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, be readily accessible 
to and usable by handicapped persons. The regulation also makes clear 
that the agency is not required to make each of its existing facilities 
accessible (Sec. 39.150(a)(1)). However, Sec. 39.150, unlike 28 CFR 
41.56-41.57, places explicit limits on the agency's obligation to ensure 
program accessibility (Sec. 39.150(a)(2)). This provision provoked 959 
comments, the largest number received on any single issue. Most 
commenters sought the deletion of the ``undue financial and 
administrative burdens'' language from the regulation. On the basis of 
preliminary comments on this paragraph, the Department published 
clarifying language in its Supplemental Notice. The final version 
includes that clarification.

    The ``undue financial and administrative burdens'' language (found 
at Sec. Sec. 39.150(a)(2) and 39.160(d)) is based on the Supreme 
Court's Davis holding that section 504 does not require program 
modifications that result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a 
program, and on the Court's statement that section 504 does not require 
modifications that would result in ``undue financial and administrative 
burdens.'' 442 U.S. at 412. Since Davis, circuit courts have applied 
this limitation on a showing that only one of the two ``undue burdens'' 
would be created as a result of the modification sought to be imposed 
under section 504. See, e.g., Dopico v. Goldschmidt, supra; American 
Public Transit Association v. Lewis, supra (APTA). In APTA the United 
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit applied the 
Davis language and invalidated the section 504 regulations of the 
Department of Transportation (DOT). The court in APTA noted ``that at 
some point a transit system's refusal to take modest, affirmative steps 
to accommodate handicapped persons might well violate section 504. But 
DOT's rules do not mandate only modest expenditures. The regulations 
require extensive modifications of existing systems and impose extremely 
heavy financial burdens on local transit authorities.'' 655 F.2d at 
1278.

    The inclusion of subparagraph (a)(2) is an effort to conform the 
agency's regulation implementing section 504 to the Supreme Court's 
interpretation of the statute in Davis as well as to the decisions of 
lower courts following the Davis opinion. This subparagraph 
acknowledges, in light of recent case law, that, in some situations, 
certain accommodations for a handicapped person may so alter an agency's 
program or activity, or entail such extensive costs and administrative 
burdens that the refusal to undertake the accommodations is not 
discriminatory. The failure to include such a provision could lead to 
judicial invalidation of the regulation or reversal of a particular 
enforcement action taken pursuant to the regulation.

    Many commenters argued that the Supreme Court's decision in Davis 
did not require inclusion of an undue burdens defense in this 
regulation. These commenters asserted that the holding in Davis was that 
the plaintiff was not a qualified handicapped person and that the 
subsequent reference to ``undue financial and administrative burdens'' 
was mere dicta. These commenters overlook the interpretations of Davis 
provided by the Federal circuit court cases mentioned above. The APTA 
and Dopico decisions make it clear that financial burdens can limit the 
obligation to comply with section 504. See also New Mexico Association 
for Retarded Citizens v. New Mexico, 678 F.2d 847 (10th Cir. 1982).

    Many commenters argued that inclusion of the undue burdens defense 
was inconsistent with the position taken by Vice President Bush in his 
letter of March 21, 1983, in which he announced the Administration's 
decision not to revise the coordination regulation for federally 
assisted programs. The decision to include the undue burdens defense 
represents no contradiction with the position taken by Vice President 
Bush on the guidelines for federally assisted programs. In his letter 
the Vice President stated that ``extensive change of the existing 504 
coordination regulations was not required, and that with respect to 
those few areas where clarification might be desirable, the courts are 
currently providing useful guidance and can be expected to continue to 
do so in the future.'' One element of that ``useful guidance'' obviously 
comes from interpretations of the Davis decision by the lower Federal 
courts.

    The Department has carefully considered the comments on the process 
that the Department should follow in determining whether a program 
modification would result in undue financial and administrative burdens. 
The Department intends to be guided by six principles in its application 
of the ``fundamental alteration'' and ``undue financial and 
administrative burdens'' language.

    First, because of the extensive resources and capabilities that 
could properly be drawn upon for section 504 purposes by a large Federal 
agency like the Department of Justice, the Department explicitly 
acknowledges that, in most cases, making a Department program accessible 
will likely not result in undue burdens. Second, the burden of proving 
that the accommodation request will result in a fundamental alteration 
or undue burdens has been placed squarely on the Department of Justice, 
not on the handicapped

[[Page 777]]

person. Third, in determining whether financial and administrative 
burdens are undue, the Department is to consider all Department 
resources available for use in the funding and operation of the 
conducted program. Fourth, the ``fundamental alteration''/``undue 
burdens'' decision is to be made by the Attorney General or his designee 
and must be accompanied by a written statement of reasons for reaching 
such a conclusion. Fifth, if a disabled person disagrees with the 
Attorney General's finding, he or she can file a complaint under the 
complaint procedures established by the final regulation. A significant 
feature of this complaint adjudication procedure is the availability of 
a hearing before an independent administrative law judge under the due 
process protections of the Administrative Procedure Act. Sixth and 
finally, even if there is a determination that making a program 
accessible will fundamentally alter the nature of the program, or will 
result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the Department 
must still take action, short of that outer limit, that will open 
participation in the Department's program to disabled persons to the 
fullest extent possible.

    One hundred and eighty-one commenters on the Supplemental Notice 
objected to the provision that the ``undue burdens'' decision would be 
based on consideration of ``all agency resources available for use in 
the funding and operation of the conducted program,'' arguing that it 
should be based on the resources of the agency as a whole. Some argued 
that this formulation was required because all agency resources come 
from taxpayer monies and should not be used to support discrimination.

    The Department's entire budget is an inappropriate touchstone for 
making determinations as to undue financial and administrative burdens. 
Many parts of the Department's budget are earmarked for specific 
purposes and are simply not available for use in making the Department's 
programs accessible to disabled persons. For example, funds for the 
operation of the Bureau of Prisons are unavailable for defraying the 
cost of a sign language interpreter at a deportation hearing conducted 
by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. There are extensive 
resources available to the Department and it is expected that the 
Department will, only on very rare occasions, be faced with ``undue 
burdens'' in meeting the program accessibility or communications 
sections of the regulation.

    One commenter said that the term ``undue hardship'' used in 
regulations for federally assisted programs is more specific and less 
discriminatory than the term ``undue burdens.'' The term ``undue 
hardship'' is a term of art used in connection with employment. The term 
``undue burdens'' is taken from the Supreme Court's opinion in Davis and 
is appropriately included in this regulation.

    Some commenters argued that section 504 creates an absolute right to 
access, and that cost cannot limit this right, although it may be a 
factor in determining timeframes for compliance. Section 504 does not 
create an absolute right to access. The Supreme Court stated in Davis 
that recipients need not undertake modifications to their programs to 
meet the requirements of section 504 that would result in ``undue 
financial and administrative burdens.'' This understanding of section 
504 and its implementing regulations for federally assisted programs is 
shared by the lower Federal courts, which have routinely applied the 
``undue burdens'' limitation to accessibility issues. Congress suggested 
no different interpretation of section 504 when applying it to federally 
conducted programs. Spreading the cost of compliance over a period of 
time is, however, one way of avoiding undue financial and administrative 
burdens, and the Department will consider that as an option whenever it 
considers asserting that defense.

    Paragraph (b) sets forth a number of means by which program 
accessibility may be achieved, including redesign of equipment, 
reassignment of services to accessible buildings, and provision of 
aides. In choosing among methods, the agency shall give priority 
consideration to those that will be consistent with provision of 
services in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of 
handicapped persons. Structural changes in existing facilities are 
required only when there is no other feasible way to make the agency's 
program accessible. The agency may comply with the program accessibility 
requirement by delivering services at alternate accessible sites or 
making home visits as appropriate.

    Paragraphs (c) and (d) establish time periods for complying with the 
program accessibility requirement. As currently required for federally 
assisted programs by 28 CFR 41.57(b), the agency must make any necessary 
structural changes in facilities as soon as practicable, but in no event 
later than three years after the effective date of this regulation. 
Where structural modifications are required, a transition plan shall be 
developed within six months of the effective date of this regulation. 
Aside from structural changes, all other necessary steps to achieve 
compliance shall be taken within sixty days.


Section 39.151 Program accessibility: New construction and alterations


    Overlapping coverage exists with respect to new construction under 
section 504, section 502 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as

[[Page 778]]

amended (29 U.S.C 792), and the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as 
amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157). Section 39.151 provides that those 
buildings that are constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the 
use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered to be 
readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons in accordance 
with 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607. This standard was promulgated 
pursuant to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 
U.S.C. 4151-4157). It is appropriate to adopt the existing Architectural 
Barriers Act standard for section 504 compliance because new and altered 
buildings subject to this regulation are also subject to the 
Architectural Barriers Act and because adoption of the standard will 
avoid duplicative and possibly inconsistent standards.

    Existing buildings leased by the agency after the effective date of 
this regulation are not required to meet the new construction standard. 
They are subject, however, to the requirements of Sec. 39.150.

    A commenter has recommended that the regulation should require that 
buildings leased after the effective date of the regulation should meet 
the new construction standards of Sec. 39.151, rather than the program 
accessibility standard for existing facilities in Sec. 39.150. Federal 
practice under section 504 has always treated newly leased buildings as 
subject to the existing facility program accessibility standard. Unlike 
the construction of new buildings where architectural barriers can be 
avoided at little or no cost, the application of new construction 
standards to an existing building being leased raises the same prospect 
of retrofitting buildings as the use of an existing Federal facility, 
and the Department believes the same program accessibility standard 
should apply to both owned and leased existing buildings.


Section 39.160 Communications


    Section 39.160 requires the agency to take appropriate steps to 
ensure effective communication with personnel of other Federal entities, 
applicants, participants, and members of the public. These steps include 
procedures for determining when auxiliary aids are necessary under Sec. 
39.160(a)(1) to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, the agency's program or 
activity. They also include an opportunity for handicapped persons to 
request the auxiliary aids of their choice. This expressed choice shall 
be given primary consideration by the agency (Sec. 39.160(a)(1)(i)). 
The agency shall honor the choice unless it can demonstrate that another 
effective means of communication exists or that use of the means chosen 
would not be required under Sec. 39.160(d). That paragraph limits the 
obligation of the agency to ensure effective communication in accordance 
with Davis and the circuit court opinions interpreting it (see supra 
preamble Sec. 39.150(a)(2)). Unless not required by Sec. 39.160(d), 
the agency shall provide auxiliary aids at no cost to the handicapped 
person.

    In some circumstances, a notepad and written materials may be 
sufficient to permit effective communication with a hearing-impaired 
person. In many circumstances, however, they may not be, particularly 
when the information being communicated is complex or exchanged for a 
lengthy period of time (e.g., a meeting) or where the hearing-impaired 
applicant or participant is not skilled in spoken or written language. 
In these cases, a sign language interpreter may be appropriate. For 
vision-impaired persons, effective communication might be achieved by 
several means, including readers and audio recordings. In general, the 
agency intends to inform the public of (1) the communications services 
it offers to afford handicapped persons an equal opportunity to 
participate in or benefit from its programs or activities, (2) the 
opportunity to request a particular mode of communication, and (3) the 
agency's preferences regarding auxiliary aids when several different 
modes are effective.

    The agency shall ensure effective communication with vision-impaired 
and hearing-impaired persons involved in hearings conducted by the 
agency, e.g., INS deportation proceedings. Auxiliary aids in these 
proceedings must be afforded where they are necessary to ensure 
effective communication at the proceedings. When sign language 
interpreters are necessary, the agency may require that it be given 
reasonable notice prior to the proceeding of the need for an 
interpreter. Moreover, the agency need not provide individually 
prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices 
of a personal nature (Sec. 39.160(a)(1)(ii)). For example, the agency 
need not provide eye glasses or hearing aids to applicants or 
participants in its programs. Similarly, the regulation does not require 
the agency to provide wheelchairs to persons with mobility impairments.

    Some commenters suggested that the Department's language in Sec. 
39.160(a)(1)(ii) that states that the agency need not provide 
individually prescribed devices or readers for personal use or study be 
modified to state that such devices are not required for ``nonprogram 
material.'' This suggestion has not been adopted because it is less 
clear than the existing formulation, which is intended to distinguish 
between communications that are necessary to obtain the benefits of the 
federal programs and those that are not and which parallels the 
requirements of the Federal government's section 504 regulations for 
federally assisted programs. For example, a

[[Page 779]]

federally operated library would have to ensure effective communication 
between its librarian and a patron, but not between the patron and a 
friend who had accompanied him or her to the library.

    Several comments suggested that the definition of auxiliary aids 
should include attendant services that may be needed to aid disabled 
persons to travel to meetings. Other comments recommended that in some 
cases attendant services may be an appropriate auxiliary aid to achieve 
program accessiblity.

    The Department has not adopted the approach recommended by these 
comments. To the extent that the services of an attendant are not 
directly related to a federally conducted program or activity, it would 
be inappropriate to require them at Federal expense. For example, the 
services of a sign language interpreter make a workshop as available to 
any deaf participant as it is to other participants. The need for 
services of interpreters arises directly out of the presentation of 
information in a form that can be understood by hearing persons. 
However, the Department views the services of an attendant for a 
disabled person as generally personal in nature and not directly related 
to the federally conducted program.

    A different conclusion, however, might be reached for Federal 
employees or other persons traveling for the agency. Where a disabled 
person who is unable to travel without an attendant is required to 
perform official travel, the travel expenses of an attendant, including 
per diem and transportation expenses, may be paid by the Department. See 
5 U.S.C. 3102(d) (1982).

    Paragraph (b) requires the agency to provide information to 
handicapped persons concerning accessible services, activities, and 
facilities. Paragraph (c) requires the agency to provide signage at 
inaccessible facilities that directs users to locations with information 
about accessible facilities.


Section 39.170 Compliance procedures


    Section 39.170 establishes a detailed complaint processing and 
review procedure for resolving allegations of discrimination in 
violation of section 504 in the Department of Justice's programs and 
activities. The 1978 amendments to section 504 failed to provide a 
specific statutory remedy for violations of section 504 in federally 
conducted programs. The amendment's legislative history suggesting 
parallelism between section 504 for federally conducted and federally 
assisted programs is unhelpful in this area because the fund termination 
mechanism used in section 504 federally assisted regulations depends on 
the legal relationship between a Federal funding agency and the 
recipients to which the Federal funding is extended. The Department has 
decided that the most effective and appropriate manner in which to 
enforce section 504 in the federally conducted area is through an 
equitable complaint resolution process. Section 39.170 establishes this 
process.

    The complaint process in the final rule is substantially the same as 
the one that the Department proposed. The Department received 57 
comments on this section. These comments did not question the use of a 
complaint-responsive enforcement scheme as appropriate for section 504 
for federally conducted programs. The Department continues to view its 
specific proposal as satisfactory.

    Paragraph (a) specifies that paragraphs (c) through (l) of this 
section establish the procedures for processing complaints other than 
employment complaints. Paragraph (b) provides that the agency will 
process employment complaints according to procedures established in 
existing regulations of the EEOC (29 CFR part 1613) pursuant to section 
501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791).

    Paragraph (c) vests in the Responsible Official the responsibility 
for the overall management of the 504 compliance program. ``Responsible 
Official'' or ``Official,'' as defined in Sec. 39.103, refers to the 
Director of Equal Employment Opportunity, who is designated as the 
official responsible for coordinating implementation of compliance 
procedures set forth in Sec. 39.170. The definition of ``Official'' 
includes other Department Officials to whom authority has been delegated 
by the Official. The Assistant Attorney General for Administration has 
been designated as the Director of Equal Employment Opportunity for the 
Department. See 28 CFR 42.2(a).

    Although one person has responsibility both for administering the 
Equal Employment Opportunity Program for the Department and for 
coordinating implementation of the compliance procedures under this 
part, the procedures for carrying out these two responsibilities are 
different. The Official would follow the procedures for enforcing equal 
employment opportunity, as set forth in 29 CFR part 1613, only for 
complaints alleging employment discrimination (see Sec. 39.170(b)). 
Other complaints would be processed under the procedures in Sec. 
39.170. Authority for processing complaints of employment discrimination 
has been delegated to Equal Employment Opportunity Officers in some 
Department components, and it is expected that authority for enforcing 
this part will be similarly delegated.

    Subparagraphs (d) (1) and (3) provide that any person who believes 
that he or she has been discriminated against may file a complaint 
within 180 days from the date of the alleged discrimination. The 
Official may extend the time limit when the complainant shows good 
cause. Good cause could be found

[[Page 780]]

if, for example, (1) the complainant mistakenly filed with the wrong 
agency and was not informed of the mistake within the 180 days; or (2) 
the complainant could not reasonably be expected to know of the act or 
event said to be discriminatory.

    Several commenters argued that the proposed rule unnecessarily 
restricted the right to file a complaint by not allowing an individual 
victim of discrimination to authorize a representative to file on his or 
her behalf. The final rule permits filing by the authorized 
representative of an individual victim, or, in the case of class 
discrimination, of a member of the class, as well as by an individual 
victim or class member. The final rule has been revised to make it clear 
that complaints alleging that a specific class of persons has been 
discriminated against may only be filed by a member of that specific 
class or by a representative authorized to file the complaint by a 
member of that class (Sec. 39.170(d)(1)).

    The Federal Bureau of Prisons has established an Administrative 
Remedy Procedure for handling grievances of inmates of Federal penal 
institutions (28 CFR part 542). This procedure allows an inmate to file 
a formal written complaint with the Warden of the Institution or with 
the Regional Director. While these remedies are not a substitute for the 
right to an independent investigation by a civil rights office and 
appeal to the Complaint Adjudication Officer, the final rule requires 
inmates to exhaust these procedural remedies before filing a complaint 
with the Official. The time period for filing a complaint with the 
Official would be extended by the time spent exhausting these remedies. 
This requirement applies only to inmates and does not extend to visitors 
and employees.

    The Department received several comments on how prisoners' 
complaints should be handled. Some of them suggested that both the 
discrimination procedure and the prison grievance procedures should be 
invoked simultaneously. The Department believes that this proposal would 
require the unnecessary duplication of efforts without materially 
enhancing results. The Bureau of Prisons reported that thousands of 
inmate complaints were filed in 1983 alone and that several court 
decisions have held that the inmate administrative remedy procedure must 
be exhausted before suit can be filed. Although the volume of complaints 
by prison inmates might be burdensome, it is not possible now to 
forecast the number that will be filed. The Department believes, 
however, that handicapped prisoners must be afforded the right to have 
their complaints investigated by an office that specializes in 
discrimination complaints, including section 504 complaints, as well as 
the right to appeal to the Complaint Adjudication Officer. It is 
expected that the requirement that inmates first exhaust prison 
administrative remedies will be effective in resolving most meritorious 
complaints. It may be necessary, of course, for the Department to 
provide additional resources to handle complaints filed under the new 
regulation.

    Subparagraph (d)(2) requires that the name and identity of a 
complainant be held in confidence unless he or she waives that right in 
writing and except to the extent necessary for compliance purposes.

    Complaints may be mailed or delivered to the Attorney General, the 
Responsible Official, or other agency officials. Complaints received by 
any agency official other than the Responsible Official must be 
forwarded immediately to the Responsible Official (subparagraph (d)(4)).

    Paragraph (e) requires the agency to send to the Architectural and 
Transportation Barriers Compliance Board a copy of any complaint 
alleging that a building or facility subject to the Architectural 
Barriers Act or section 502 was designed, constructed, or altered in a 
manner that does not provide ready access to and use by handicapped 
persons.

    The Official is required to accept all complete complaints over 
which the agency has jurisdiction (Sec. 39.170(f)(1)). If the Official 
determines that the agency does not have jurisdiction over a complaint, 
the Official shall promptly notify the complainant and make reasonable 
efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate entity of the Federal 
government (Sec. 39.170(f)(3)).

    If a complaint is not complete when it is filed, the Official must 
notify the complainant within 30 days that additional information is 
needed. The complainant must furnish the necessary information within 30 
days of receipt of the notice, or the complaint will be dismissed 
without prejudice. Filing an incomplete complaint within 180 days from 
the date of the alleged discrimination satisfies the requirement of 
subparagraph (d)(3), but the timeframes governing the Official's other 
obligations to process the complaint (see, e.g., Sec. 39.170(g)(1), 
Sec. 39.170(h)) do not begin to operate until the Official receives a 
complete complaint.

    Within 180 days of receipt of the complete complaint, the Official 
is to investigate the complaint, attempt an informal resolution, and, if 
informal resolution is not achieved, issue a letter of findings (Sec. 
39.170(h)). Within the time limit, the Official should make every effort 
to achieve informal resolution whenever possible.

    In response to a suggestion from a commenter, the Department no 
longer refers to the letter of findings as ``preliminary.'' The

[[Page 781]]

word ``preliminary'' has been deleted because, if there is no appeal, 
the determination made in the letter of findings will constitute the 
final agency decision.

    Paragraph (h) requires that the Official's letter be sent to the 
complainant and respondent, and that it contain findings of fact and 
conclusions of law, the relief granted if discrimination is found, and 
notice of the right to appeal. The regulation provides that a party may 
appeal the Official's letter or findings to the Complaint Adjudication 
Officer (CAO). If neither party files an appeal from the letter of 
findings within 30 days after receipt of the letter, the letter will 
constitute the final decision of the agency (Sec. 39.170(i)(4)).

    The Department's final rule provides an opportunity for a hearing 
before an administrative law judge (ALJ). The ALJ would make a 
recommended decision to the CAO, who would make the final agency 
decision. The purpose of the hearing is to provide a forum in which the 
complainant or respondent can have an opportunity to be heard, confront 
witnesses, and present evidence so that an administrative law judge can 
issue a recommended decision that is well-reasoned and justified on the 
basis of the evidence presented.

    The opportunity for a hearing before an ALJ assures more 
impartiality and the appearance of more impartiality than a decision 
made by one agency official concerning other officials of the same 
agency. The Department expects that agency decisions based on a hearing 
record would more likely survive later judicial review.

    Under the regulation, another person or organization would be 
allowed to participate as a third party or amicus curiae if the ALJ 
determines that the petitioner has a legitimate interest in the 
proceedings, that participation will not duly delay the outcome, and 
that petitioner's participation may contribute materially to the 
disposition of the proceedings.

    The Department received comments on the proposed opportunity for a 
hearing before an administrative law judge. Some commenters were 
primarily concerned that by invoking a hearing before the ALJ with the 
procedural safeguards adopted from the Administrative Procedure Act 
(APA) (5 U.S.C. 554-557), the complainant would lose the right to a de 
novo review of the agency's final decision, because the APA allows a 
Federal court only to determine if the agency's final decisions are 
``arbitrary and capricious'' (5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A)). It is beyond our 
jurisdiction to specify that a de novo review is available to complaints 
seeking judicial review of final agency decisions. This issue is for the 
courts to decide. That is also true for the issue of the availability of 
a private right of action, either without invoking our compliance 
procedures or after the issuance of letters of findings.

    Given the inherent conflicts of interest in situations where 
complaints allege discrimination on the part of the Department, it is 
critically important to ensure that a complaint be reviewed in a fair, 
independent process. The availability of a hearing before an independent 
ALJ would provide the appearance as well as the actuality of an 
impartial compliance mechanism. The Department has therefore included 
the provision for a hearing in the final regulation.

    One comment requested the addition of a provision whereby the 
Department would award attorneys fees to complainants. Another comment 
suggested that the Equal Access to Justice Act (5 U.S.C. 504) might 
provide for the award of fees. Nothing contained in title V of the 
Rehabilitation Act provides for the agency award of attorneys fees in 
administrative proceedings other than those involving Federal 
employment. Nor does the EAJA and the Department's implementing 
regulations at 28 CFR part 24 provide for such awards in hearings 
conducted under Sec. 39.170(k). We have therefore included no attorneys 
fee provision in the current regulations.

    Under paragraph (1), the CAO renders a final agency decision after 
appeal without a hearing or after a hearing. The CAO directs appropriate 
remedial action if discrimination is found. The CAO's decision will 
involve reviewing the entire file, including the investigation report, 
letter of findings, and, if a hearing was held, the hearing record and 
recommended decision of the administrative law judge. The decision shall 
be made within 60 days of receipt of the complaint file or the hearing 
record.

    One commenter objected to the requirement in subparagraph (l)(1) 
that the CAO explain specifically a decision to reject or modify the 
ALJ's proposed findings, arguing that it would inappropriately limit the 
CAO's consideration of the issues. We have adopted the suggestion and 
eliminated the requirement.

    In response to recommendations from the Department's CAO and the 
Drug Enforcement Administration's ALJ, some changes have been made in 
the compliance procedures. Among the changes are a new requirement that 
the ALJ provide findings to all parties, not just the CAO, an added 
provision for filing exceptions to an ALJ's recommended decision, a 
delineation of the authorities of the ALJ, and a clarification of the 
responsibility for supervising compliance with the final agency decision 
between the Responsible Official and the CAO.

    The Department also received some comments on the appropriateness of 
providing for an appeal by either the complainant or

[[Page 782]]

respondent. Some commenters objected to allowing a respondent to obtain 
an administrative appeal because it could delay remedying 
discrimination. On the other hand, an impartial adjudicatory mechanism 
would require that opportunity is provided for both sides to appeal. For 
this reason, the Department finds it necessary and appropriate for both 
complainant and respondent to have the right to an administrative 
appeal.

<R04>
       Subpart A_Minimum Standards for Inmate Grievance Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 40.1  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this part--
    (a) Act means the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 
Public Law 96-247, 94 Stat. 349 (42 U.S.C. 1997).
    (b) Applicant means a state or political subdivision of a state that 
submits to the Attorney General a request for certification of a 
grievance procedure.
    (c) Attorney General means the Attorney General of the United States 
or the Attorney General's designees.
    (d) Grievance means a written complaint by an inmate on the inmate's 
own behalf regarding a policy applicable within an institution, a 
condition in an institution, an action involving an inmate of an 
institution, or an incident occurring within an institution. The term 
``grievance'' does not include a complaint relating to a parole 
decision.
    (e) Inmate means an individual confined in an institution for 
adults, who has been convicted of a crime.
    (f) Institution means a jail, prison, or other correctional 
facility, or pretrial detention facility that houses adult inmates and 
is owned, operated, or managed by or provides services on behalf of a 
State or political subdivision of a State.
    (g) State means a State of the United States, the District of 
Columbia, the commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any of the territories and 
possessions of the United States.
    (h) Substantial compliance means that there is no omission of any 
essential part from compliance, that any omission consists only of an 
unimportant defect or omission, and that there has been a firm effort to 
comply fully with the standards.


<R05>
Sec. 40.2  Adoption of procedures.

    Each applicant seeking certification of its grievance procedure for 
purposes of the Act shall adopt a written grievance procedure. Inmates 
and employees shall be afforded an advisory role in the formulation and 
implementation of a grievance procedure adopted after the effective date 
of these regulations, and shall be afforded an advisory role in 
reviewing the compliance with the standards set forth herein of a 
grievance procedure adopted prior to the effective date of these 
regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 40.3  Communication of procedures.

    The written grievance procedure shall be readily available to all 
employees and inmates of the institution. Additionally, each inmate and 
employee shall, upon arrival at the institution, receive written 
notification and an oral explanation of the procedure,

[[Page 783]]

including the opportunity to have questions regarding the procedure 
answered orally. The written procedure shall be available in any 
language spoken by a significant portion of the institution's 
population, and appropriate provisions shall be made for those not 
speaking those languages, as well as for the impaired and the 
handicapped.


<R05>
Sec. 40.4  Accessibility.

    Each inmate shall be entitled to invoke the grievance procedure 
regardless of any disciplinary, classification, or other administrative 
or legislative decision to which the inmate may be subject. The 
institution shall ensure that the procedure is accessible to impaired 
and handicapped inmates.


<R05>
Sec. 40.5  Applicability.

    The grievance procedure shall be applicable to a broad range of 
complaints and shall state specifically the types of complaints covered 
and excluded. At a minimum, the grievance procedure shall permit 
complaints by inmates regarding policies and conditions within the 
jurisdiction of the institution or the correctional agency that affect 
them personally, as well as actions by employees and inmates, and 
incidents occurring within the institution that affect them personally. 
The grievance procedure shall not be used as a disciplinary procedure.


<R05>
Sec. 40.6  Remedies.

    The grievance procedure shall afford a successful grievant a 
meaningful remedy. Although available remedies may vary among 
institutions, a reasonable range of meaningful remedies in each 
institution is necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 40.7  Operation and decision.

    (a) Initiation. The institution may require an inmate to attempt 
informal resolution before the inmate files a grievance under this 
procedure. The procedure for initiating a grievance shall be simple and 
include the use of a standard form. Necessary materials shall be freely 
available to all inmates and assistance shall be readily available for 
inmates who cannot complete the forms themselves. Forms shall not demand 
unnecessary technical compliance with formal structure or detail, but 
shall encourage a simple and straightforward statement of the inmate's 
grievance.
    (b) Inmate and employee participation. The institution shall provide 
for an advisory role for employees and inmates in the operation of the 
grievance system. In-person hearings and committees consisting of either 
inmates or employees or both are not required by this paragraph, but 
they are permitted so long as no inmate participates in the resolution 
of any other inmate's grievance over the objection of the grievant.
    (c) Investigation and consideration. No inmate or employee who 
appears to be involved in the matter shall participate in any capacity 
in the resolution of the grievance.
    (d) Reasoned, written responses. Each grievance shall be answered in 
writing at each level of decision and review. The response shall state 
the reasons for the decision reached and shall include a statement that 
the inmate is entitled to further review, if such is available, and 
shall contain simple directions for obtaining such review.
    (e) Fixed time limits. Responses shall be made within fixed time 
limits at each level of decision. Time limits may vary between 
institutions, but expeditious processing of grievances at each level of 
decision is essential to prevent grievance from becoming moot. Unless 
the grievant has been notified of an extension of time for a response, 
expiration of a time limit at any stage of the process shall entitle the 
grievant to move to the next stage of the process. In all instances 
grievances must be processed from initiation to final disposition within 
180 days, inclusive of any extensions.
    (f) Review. The grievant shall be entitled to review by a person or 
other entity, not under the institution's supervision or control, of the 
disposition of all grievances, including alleged reprisals by an 
employee against an inmate. A request for review shall be allowed 
automatically without interference by

[[Page 784]]

administrators or employees of the institution and such review shall be 
conducted without influence or interference by administrators or 
employees of the institution.

[Order No. 957-81, 46 FR 48186, Oct. 1, 1981, as amended by Order No. 
1618-92, 57 FR 38773, Aug. 27, 1992; Order No. 1955-95, 60 FR 13902, 
Mar. 15, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 40.8  Emergency procedure.

    The grievance procedure shall contain special provision for 
responding to grievances of an emergency nature. Emergency grievances 
shall be defined, at a minimum, as matters regarding which disposition 
according to the regular time limits would subject the inmate to a 
substantial risk of personal injury, or cause other serious and 
irreparable harm to the inmate. Emergency grievances shall be forwarded 
immediately, without substantive review, to the level at which 
corrective action can be taken. The procedure for resolving emergency 
grievances shall provide for expedited responses at every level of 
decision. The emergency procedure shall also include review by a person 
or entity not under the supervision or control of the institution.


<R05>
Sec. 40.9  Reprisals.

    The grievance procedure shall prohibit reprisals. ``Reprisal'' means 
any action or threat of action against anyone for the good faith use of 
or good faith participation in the grievance procedure. The written 
procedure shall include assurance that good faith use of or good faith 
participation in the grievance mechanism will not result in formal or 
informal reprisal. An inmate shall be entitled to pursue through the 
grievance procedure a complaint that a reprisal occurred.


<R05>
Sec. 40.10  Records--nature; confidentiality.

    (a) Nature. Records regarding the filing and disposition of 
grievances shall be collected and maintained systematically by the 
institution. Such records shall be preserved for at least three years 
following final disposition of the grievance. At a minimum, such records 
shall include aggregate information regarding the numbers, types and 
dispositions of grievances, as well as individual records of the date of 
and the reasons for each disposition at each stage of the procedure.
    (b) Confidentiality. Records regarding the participation of an 
individual in the grievance proceedings shall be considered confidential 
and shall be handled under the same procedures used to protect other 
confidential case records. Consistent with ensuring confidentiality, 
staff who are participating in the disposition of a grievance shall have 
access to records essential to the resolution of the grievance.


<R04>
    Subpart B_Procedures for Obtaining Certification of a Grievance 
                                Procedure


<R05>
Sec. 40.11  Submissions by applicant.

    (a) Written statement. An application for certification of a 
grievance procedure under the Act shall be submitted to the Office of 
the Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, Main Justice Building, 
Washington, DC 20530, and shall include a written statement describing 
the grievance procedure, a brief description of the institution or 
institutions covered by the procedure, and accompanying plans for or 
evidence of implementation in each institution.
    (b) Evidence of compliance with established standards. An applicant 
seeking certification of a grievance procedure as being in substantial 
compliance with the standards promulgated herein should submit evidence 
of compliance with those standards, including the following information:
    (1) Instructional materials. A copy of the instructional materials 
for inmates and employees regarding use of the grievance procedure 
together with a description of the manner in which such materials are 
distributed, a description of the oral explanation of the grievance 
procedure, including the circumstances under which it is delivered, and 
a description of the training, if any, provided to employees and inmates 
in the skills necessary to operate the grievance procedure.
    (2) Form. A copy of the form used by inmates to initiate a grievance 
and to obtain review of the disposition of a grievance.

[[Page 785]]

    (3) Information regarding past compliance. For a grievance procedure 
that has operated for more than one year at the time of the application, 
the applicant shall submit information regarding the number and types of 
grievances filed over the preceding year, the disposition of the 
grievances with sample responses from each level of decision, the 
remedies granted, evidence of compliance with time limits at each level 
of decision, and a description of the role of inmates and employees in 
the formulation, implementation, and operation of the grievance 
procedure.
    (4) Plan for collecting information. For a grievance procedure that 
has operated for less than one year at the time of the application, the 
applicant shall submit a plan for collecting the information described 
in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
    (5) Assurance of confidentiality. A description of the steps taken 
to ensure the confidentiality of records of individual use of or 
participation in the grievance procedure.
    (6) Evaluation. A description of the plans for periodic evaluation 
of the grievance procedure, including identification of the group, 
individuals or individual who will conduct the evaluation and 
identification of the person or entity not under the control of 
supervision of the institution who will review the evaluation, together 
with two copies of the most recent evaluation, if one has been 
performed.
    (c) Fair and effective procedures. The Attorney General shall also 
certify a grievance procedure under the Act, even if the procedure is 
not in substantial compliance with the standards promulgated herein, if 
the Attorney General determines that the procedure is otherwise fair and 
effective for the consideration and disposition of grievances filed by 
inmates. If a grievance procedure is not in substantial compliance with 
all standards herein, the applicant shall identify the aspects in which 
the procedure is in substantial compliance and those in which it is not, 
describe the other relevant features of the procedure, and explain why 
the procedure is otherwise fair and effective.

[Order No. 1955-95, 60 FR 13903, Mar. 15, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 40.12  Notice of intent to apply for certification.

    The applicant shall post notice of its intent to request 
certification in prominent places in each institution to be covered by 
the procedure and shall provide similar written notice to the U.S. 
District Court(s) having jurisdiction over each institution to be 
covered by the procedure. The notices shall invite comments regarding 
the grievance procedure and direct them to the Attorney General.


<R05>
Sec. 40.13  Review by the Attorney General.

    The Attorney General shall review and respond to each application as 
promptly as the circumstances, including the need for independent 
investigation and consideration of the comments of agencies, and 
interested groups and persons, permit.


<R05>
Sec. 40.14  Conditional certification.

    If, in the judgment of the Attorney General, a grievance procedure 
that has been in existence less than one year is at the time of 
application in substantial compliance with the standards promulgated 
herein or is otherwise fair and effective, the Attorney General shall 
grant conditional certification for one year or until the applicant 
satisfies the requirements of Sec. 40.15, whichever period is shorter.

[Order No. 1955-95, 60 FR 13903, Mar. 15, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 40.15  Full certification.

    If, in the judgment of the Attorney General, a grievance procedure 
that has been in existence longer than one year at the time of 
application is in substantial compliance with the standards promulgated 
herein or is otherwise fair and effective, the Attorney General shall 
grant full certification. Such certification shall remain in effect

<R05>
Sec. 40.16  Denial of certification.

    If the Attorney General finds that the grievance procedure is not in

Sec. 40.18  Suspension of certification.

    (a) Reasonable belief of non-compliance. If the Attorney General has 
reasonable grounds to believe that a previously certified grievance 
procedure may no longer be in substantial compliance with the minimum 
standards or may no longer be fair and effective, the Attorney General 
shall suspend certification. The suspension shall continue until such 
time as the deficiency is corrected, in which case certification shall 
be reinstated, or until the Attorney General determines that substantial 
compliance no longer exists or that the procedure is no longer fair and 
effective, in which case, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section, the Attorney General shall withdraw certification pursuant to 
Sec. 40.19 of this part.
    (b) Defect may be readily remedied; good faith effort. If the 
Attorney General determines that a grievance procedure is no longer in 
substantial compliance with the minimum standards or is no longer fair 
and effective, but has reason to believe that the defect may be readily 
corrected and that good faith efforts are underway to correct it, the 
Attorney General may suspend certification until the grievance procedure 
returns to compliance with the minimum standards or is otherwise fair 
and effective.
    (c) Recertification after suspension pursuant to paragraph (a) of 
this section. The Attorney General shall reinstate the certification of 
an applicant whose certification was suspended pursuant to paragraph (a) 
of this section upon a demonstration in writing by the applicant that 
the specific deficiency on which the suspension was based has been 
corrected or that the information that caused the Attorney General to 
suspend certification was erroneous.
    (d) Recertification after suspension pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section. The Attorney General shall reinstate the certification of 
an applicant whose certification has been suspended pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section upon a demonstration in writing that the 
deficiency on which the suspension was based has been corrected.
    (e) Notification in writing of suspension or reinstatement. The 
Attorney General shall notify an applicant in writing that certification 
has been suspended or reinstated and state the reasons for the action.

<R05>
Sec. 40.19  Withdrawal of certification.

    (a) Finding of non-compliance. If the Attorney General finds that a 
grievance procedure is no longer in substantial compliance with the 
minimum standards or is no longer otherwise fair and effective, the 
Attorney General shall withdraw certification, unless the Attorney 
General concludes that suspension of certification under Sec. 40.18(b) 
of this part is appropriate.
    (b) Notification in writing of withdrawal of certification. The 
Attorney General shall notify an applicant in writing that certification 
has been withdrawn and state the reasons for the action.
    (c) Recertification after withdrawal. An applicant whose 
certification has been withdrawn and who wishes to receive 
recertification shall submit a new application for certification.

[Order No. 957-81, 46 FR 48186, Oct. 1, 1981, as amended by Order No.

    A proposed change in a certified procedure must be submitted to the 
Attorney General thirty days in advance of

[[Page 787]]

its proposed effective date. The Attorney General shall review such 
proposed change and notify the applicant in writing before the effective 
date of the proposed change if such change will result in suspension or 
withdrawal of the certification of the grievance procedure.


<R05>
Sec. 40.21  Notification of court.

    The Attorney General shall notify in writing the Chief Judges of the 
U.S. Court of Appeals and of the U.S. District Court(s) within whose 
jurisdiction the applicant is located of the certification, suspension 
of certification, withdrawal of certification and recertification of the 
applicant's grievance procedure. The Attorney General shall also notify 
the court of the certification status of any grievance procedure at the 
request of the court or any party in an action by an adult inmate 
pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1983.


<R05>
Sec. 40.22  Significance of certification.

    Certification of a grievance procedure by the Attorney General shall 
signify only that on the basis of the information submitted, the 
Attorney General believes the grievance procedure is in substantial 
compliance with the minimum standards or is otherwise fair and 
effective. Certification shall not indicate approval of the use or 
application of the grievance procedure in a particular case.

    (vi) Deny an individual an opportunity to participate in the program 
through the provision of services or otherwise or afford him an

the program (including the opportunity to participate in the program as 
an employee but only to the extent set forth in paragraph (c) of this 
section).
    (vii) Deny a person the opportunity to participate as a member of a

such program, or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in 
which, such will be provided under any such program, or the class of 
individuals to be afforded an opportunity to participate in any such 
program, may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, 
utilize criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of 
subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, 
or national

[[Page 799]]

origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing 
accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respects individuals 
of a particular race, color, or national origin.
    (3) In determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient 
or applicant may not make selections with the purpose or effect of 
excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting 
them to discrimination under any program to which this subpart applies, 
on the ground of race, color, or national origin; or with the purpose or 
effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the 
objectives of the Act or this subpart.
    (4) For the purposes of this section the disposition, services,

in this paragraph and in paragraph (c) of this section does not limit 
the generality of the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (6)(i) In administering a program regarding which the recipient has 
previously discriminated against persons on the ground of race, color, 
or national origin, the recipient must take affirmative action to 
overcome the effects of prior discrimination.
    (ii) Even in the absence of such prior discrimination, a recipient 
in administering a program may take affirmative action to overcome the 
effects of conditions which resulted in limiting participation by 
persons of a particular race, color, or national origin.
    (c) Employment practices. (1) Whenever a primary objective of the 
Federal financial assistance to a program to which this subpart applies, 
is to provide employment, a recipient of such assistance may not 
(directly or through contractual or other arrangements) subject any 
individual to discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national 
origin in its employment practices under such program (including 
recruitment or recruitment advertising, employment, layoff, or 
termination, upgrading, demotion, or transfer, rates of pay or other 
forms of compensation, and use of facilities). That prohibition also 
applies to programs as to which a primary objective of the Federal 
financial assistance is (i) to assist individuals, through employment, 
to meet expenses incident to the commencement or continuation of their 
education or training, or (ii) to provide work experience which 
contributes to the education or training of the individuals involved. 
The requirements applicable to construction employment under any such 
program shall be those specified in or pursuant to part III of Executive 
Order 11246 or any Executive order which supersedes it.
    (2) In regard to Federal financial assistance which does not have 
providing employment as a primary objective, the provisions of paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section apply to the employment practices of the 
recipient if discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national 
origin in such employment practices tends, on the ground of race, color, 
or national origin, to exclude persons from participation in, to deny 
them the benefits of or to subject them to discrimination under the 
program receiving Federal financial assistance. In any such case, the 
provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall apply to the extent 
necessary to assure equality of opportunity to and nondiscriminatory 
treatment of beneficiaries.

Sec. 42.105  Assurance required.

    (a) General. (1) Every application for Federal financial assistance 
to which this subpart applies, and every application for Federal 
financial assistance to provide a facility shall, as a condition to its 
approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant 
to the application, contain or be accompanied by an assurance that the 
program will be conducted or the facility operated in compliance with 
all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this subpart. In the case 
where the

[[Page 800]]

Federal financial assistance is to provide or is in the form of personal 
property, or real property or interest therein or structures thereon, 
such assurance shall obligate the recipient, or, in the case of a 
subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the 
property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial 
assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of 
similar services or benefits, or for as long as the recipient retains 
ownership or possession of the property, whichever is longer. In all 
other cases, such assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period 
during which Federal financial assistance is extended pursuant to the 
application. The responsible Department official shall specify the form 
of the foregoing assurances, and the extent to which like assurances 
will be required of subgrantees, contractors, and subcontractors, 
transferees, successors in interest, and other participants. Any such 
assurance shall include provisions which give the United States a right 
to seek its judicial enforcement.
    (2) In the case of real property, structures or improvements 
thereon, or interest therein, which was acquired with Federal financial 
assistance, or in the case where Federal financial assistance is 
provided in the form of a transfer of real property or interest therein 
from the Federal Government, the instrument effecting or recording the 
transfer shall contain a convenant running with the land assuring 
nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used 
for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or 
for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or 
benefits. Where no transfer of property is involved, but property is 
improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to 
include such a covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. 
Where the property is obtained from the Federal Government, such 
covenant may also include a condition coupled with a right to be 
reserved by the Department to revert title to the property in the event 
of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of the responsible 
Department official, such a condition and right of reverter are 
appropriate to the statute under which the real property is obtained and 
to the nature of the grant and the grantee.
    (b) Assurances from government agencies. In the case of any 
application from any department, agency, or office of any State or local 
government for Federal financial assistance for any specified purpose, 
the assurance required by this section shall extend to any other 
department, agency, or office of the same governmental unit if the 
policies of such other department, agency, or office will substantially 
affect the project for which Federal financial assistance is requested.
    (c) Assurance from academic and other institutions. (1) In the case 
of any application for Federal financial assistance for any purpose to 
an academic institution, the assurance required by this section shall 
extend to admission practices and to all other practices relating to the 
treatment of students.
    (2) The assurance required with respect to an academic institution, 
detention or correctional facility, or any other institution or 
facility, insofar as the assurance relates to the institution's 
practices with respect to admission or other treatment of individuals as 
students, patients, wards, inmates, persons subject to control, or 
clients of the institution or facility or to the opportunity to 
participate in the provision of services, disposition, treatment, or 
benefits to such individuals, shall be applicable to the entire 
institution or facility.
    (d) Continuing Federal financial assistance. Any State or State 
agency applying for continuing Federal financial assistance subject to 
this regulation shall as a condition for the extension of such 
assistance:
    (1) Provide a statement that the program is (or, in the case of a 
new program, will be) conducted in compliance with this regulation, and
    (2) Provide for such methods of administration as are found by the 
responsible Department official to give reasonable assurance that the 
primary recipient and all other recipients of Federal financial 
assistance under such

[[Page 801]]

program will comply with this regulation.

<R05>
Sec. 42.106  Compliance information.

    (a) Cooperation and assistance. Each responsible Department official 
shall, to the fullest extent practicable, seek the cooperation of 
recipients in obtaining compliance with this subpart and shall provide 
assistance and guidance to recipients to help them comply voluntarily 
with this subpart.
    (b) Compliance reports. Each recipient shall keep such records and 
submit to the responsible Department official or his designee timely, 
complete, and accurate compliance reports at such times, and in such 
form and containing such information, as the responsible Department 
official or his designee may determine to be necessary to enable him to 
ascertain whether the recipient has complied or is complying with this 
subpart. In general, recipients should have available for the Department 
racial and ethnic data showing the extent to which members of minority 
groups are beneficiaries of federally assisted programs. In the case in 
which a primary recipient extends Federal financial assistance to any 
other recipient or subcontracts with any other person or group, such 
other recipient shall also submit such compliance reports to the primary 
recipient as may be necessary to enable the primary recipient to carry 
out its obligations under this subpart.
    (c) Access to sources of information. Each recipient shall permit 
access by the responsible Department official or his designee during 
normal business hours to such of its books, records, accounts, and other 
sources of information, and its facilities, as may be pertinent to 
ascertain compliance with this subpart. Whenever any information 
required of a recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other 
agency, institution, or person and that agency, institution, or person 
fails or refuses to furnish that information, the recipient shall so 
certify in its report and set forth the efforts which it has made to 
obtain the information.
    (d) Information to beneficiaries and participants. Each recipient 
shall make available to participants, beneficiaries, and other 
interested persons such information regarding the provisions of this 
subpart and its applicability to the program for which the recipient 
receives Federal financial assistance, and make such information 
available to them in such manner, as the responsible Department official 
finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against 
discrimination assured them by the Act and this subpart.

[Order No. 365-66, 31 FR 10265, July 29, 1966, as amended by Order No. 
519-73, 38 FR 17955, July 5, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 42.107  Conduct of investigations.

    (a) Periodic compliance reviews. The responsible Department official 
or his designee shall from time to time review the practices of 
recipients to determine whether they are complying with this subpart.
    (b) Complaints. Any person who believes himself or any specific 
class of individuals to be subjected to discrimination prohibited by 
this subpart may by himself or by a representative file with the 
responsible Department official or his designee a written complaint. A 
complaint must be filed not later than 180 days from the date of the 
alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by the 
responsible Department official or his designee.
    (c) Investigations. The responsible Department official or his 
designee will make a prompt investigation whenever a compliance review, 
report, complaint, or any other information indicates a possible failure 
to comply with this subpart. The investigation should include, whenever 
appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and policies of the 
recipient, the circumstances under which the possible noncompliance with 
this subpart occurred, and other factors relevant to a determination as 
to whether the recipient has failed to comply with this subpart.
    (d) Resolution of matters. (1) If an investigation pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section indicates a failure to

[[Page 802]]

comply with this subpart, the responsible Department official or his 
designee will so inform the recipient and the matter will be resolved by 
informal means whenever possible. If it has been determined that the 
matter cannot be resolved by informal means, action will be taken as 
provided for in Sec. 42.108.
    (2) If an investigation does not warrant action pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the responsible Department official or 
his designee will so inform the recipient and the complainant, if any, 
in writing.
    (e) Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited. No recipient or 
other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against 
any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or 
privilege secured by section 601 of the Act or this subpart, or because 
he has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any 
manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subpart. 
The identity of complainants shall be kept confidential except to the 
extent necessary to carry out the purpose of this subpart, including the 
conduct of any investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising 
thereunder.

[Order No. 365-66, 31 FR 10265, July 29, 1966, as amended by Order No. 
519-73, 38 FR 17955, July 5, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 42.108  Procedure for effecting compliance.

    (a) General. If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure 
to comply with this subpart and if the noncompliance or threatened 
noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, the responsible 
Department official may suspend or terminate, or refuse to grant or 
continue, Federal financial assistance, or use any other means 
authorized by law, to induce compliance with this subpart. Such other 
means include, but are not limited to:
    (1) Appropriate proceedings brought by the Department to enforce any 
rights of the United States under any law of the United States 
(including other titles of the Act), or any assurance or other 
contractual undertaking, and
    (2) Any applicable proceeding under State or local law.
    (b) Noncompliance with assurance requirement. If an applicant or 
recipient fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under Sec. 
42.105, or fails or refuses to comply with the provisions of the 
assurance it has furnished, or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with 
any requirement imposed by or pursuant to title VI or this subpart, 
Federal financial assistance may be suspended, terminated, or refused in 
accordance with the procedures of title VI and this subpart. The 
Department shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case 
during the pendency of administrative proceedings under this subpart, 
except that the Department will continue assistance during the pendency 
of such proceedings whenever such assistance is due and payable pursuant 
to a final commitment made or an application finally approved prior to 
the effective date of this subpart.
    (c) Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal 
financial assistance. No order suspending, terminating, or refusing to 
grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective 
until:
    (1) The responsible Department official has advised the applicant or 
recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance 
cannot be secured by voluntary means,
    (2) There has been an express finding on the record, after 
opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to 
comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this subpart,
    (3) The action has been approved by the Attorney General pursuant to 
Sec. 42.110, and
    (4) The expiration of 30 days after the Attorney General has filed 
with the committee of the House and the committee of the Senate having 
legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written 
report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action.

Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue 
Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular 
political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to 
whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to 
the particular program, or

[[Page 803]]

part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.
    (d) Other means authorized by law. No action to effect compliance by 
any other means authorized by law shall be taken until:
    (1) The responsible Department official has determined that 
compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means,
    (2) The action has been approved by the Attorney General, and
    (3) The recipient or other person has been notified of its failure 
to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance.


<R05>
Sec. 42.109  Hearings.

    (a) Opportunity for hearing. Whenever an opportunity for a hearing 
is required by Sec. 42.108(c), reasonable notice shall be given by 
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected 
applicant or recipient. That notice shall advise the applicant or 
recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision 
under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the 
matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for that action. The notice 
shall (1) Fix a date, not less than 20 days after the date of such 
notice, within which the applicant or recipient may request that the 
responsible Department official schedule the matter for hearing, or (2) 
advise the applicant or recipient that a hearing concerning the matter 
in question has been scheduled and advise the applicant or recipient of 
the place and time of that hearing. The time and place so fixed shall be 
reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if 
any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant 
or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and 
argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to 
request a hearing under this paragraph or to appear at a hearing for 
which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to 
a hearing afforded by section 602 of the Act and Sec. 42.108(c) and 
consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as 
is available.
    (b) Time and place of hearing. Hearings shall be held at the offices 
of the Department in Washington, DC, at a time fixed by the responsible 
Department official, unless he determines that the convenience of the 
applicant or recipient or of the Department requires that another place 
be selected. Hearings shall be held before the responsible Department 
official or, at his discretion, before a hearing examiner designated in 
accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3105 and 3344 (section 11 of the Administrative 
Procedure Act).
    (c) Right to counsel. In all proceedings under this section, the 
applicant or recipient and the Department shall have the right to be 
represented by counsel.
    (d) Procedures, evidence, and record. (1) The hearing, decision, and 
any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with 
5 U.S.C. 554-557 (sections 5-8 of the Administrative Procedure Act), and 
in accordance with such rules of procedure as are proper (and not 
inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, 
giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of 
this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, 
requests for findings, and other related matters. Both the Department 
and the applicant or recipient shall be entitled to introduce all 
relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or 
as determined by the officer conducting the hearing.
    (2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings 
conducted pursuant to this subpart, but rules or principles designed to 
assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject 
testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied whenever 
reasonably necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing 
officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious 
evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the 
record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall 
be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the 
issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the 
extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions 
shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be 
made.

[[Page 804]]

    (e) Consolidated or joint hearings. In cases in which the same or 
related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with this subpart 
with respect to two or more Federal statutes, authorities, or other 
means by which Federal financial assistance is extended and to which 
this subpart applies, or noncompliance with this subpart and the 
regulations of one or more other Federal Departments or agencies issued 
under title VI of the Act, the Attorney General may, by agreement with 
such other departments or agencies, whenever appropriate, provide for 
the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application 
to such hearings of rules of procedure not inconsistent with this 
subpart. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as this subpart is 
concerned, shall be made in accordance with Sec. 42.110.

[Order No. 365-66, 31 FR 10265, July 29, 1966, as amended by Order No. 
519-73, 38 FR 17955, July 5, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 42.110  Decisions and notices.

    (a) Decisions by person other than the responsible Department 
official. If the hearing is held by a hearing examiner, such hearing 
examiner shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or 
certify the entire record, including his recommended findings and 
proposed decision, to the responsible Department official for a final 
decision, and a copy of such initial decision or certification shall be 
mailed to the applicant or recipient. Whenever the initial decision is 
made by the hearing examiner, the applicant or recipient may, within 30 
days of the mailing of such notice of initial decision, file with the 
responsible Department official his exceptions to the initial decision, 
with his reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions, the responsible 
Department official may on his own motion, within 45 days after the 
initial decision, serve on the applicant or recipient a notice that he 
will review the decision. Upon filing of such exceptions, or of such 
notice of review, the responsible Department official shall review the 
initial decision and issue his own decision thereon including the 
reasons therefor. In the absence of either exceptions or a notice of 
review the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the 
responsible Department official.
    (b) Decisions on the record or on review by the responsible 
Department official. Whenever a record is certified to the responsible 
Department official for decision or he reviews the decision of a hearing 
examiner pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or whenever the 
responsible Department official conducts the hearing, the applicant or 
recipient shall be given a reasonable opportunity to file with him 
briefs or other written statements of its contentions, and a copy of the 
final decision of the responsible Department official shall be given in 
writing to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant, if any.
    (c) Decisions on the record whenever a hearing is waived. Whenever a 
hearing is waived pursuant to Sec. 42.109(a), a decision shall be made 
by the responsible Department official on the record and a copy of such 
decision shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient, and to 
the complainant, if any.
    (d) Rulings required. Each decision of a hearing officer or 
responsible Department official shall set forth his ruling on each 
findings, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the 
requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this subpart with 
which it is found that the applicant or recipient has failed to comply.
    (e) Approval by Attorney General. Any final decision of a 
responsible Department official (other than the Attorney General) which 
provides for the suspension or termination of, or the refusal to grant 
or continue Federal financial assistance, or the imposition of any other 
sanction available under this subpart or the Act, shall promptly be 
transmitted to the Attorney General, who may approve such decision, 
vacate it, or remit or mitigate any sanction imposed.
    (f) Content of orders. The final decision may provide for suspension 
or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue, Federal financial 
assistance, in whole or in part, to which this regulation applies, and 
may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are 
consistent with, and will effectuate the purposes of, the Act and this 
subpart, including provisions designed

[[Page 805]]

to assure that no Federal financial assistance to which this regulation 
applies will thereafter be extended to the applicant or recipient 
determined by such decision to be in default in its performance of an 
assurance given by it pursuant to this subpart, or to have otherwise 
failed to comply with this subpart, unless and until, it corrects its 
noncompliance and satisfies the responsible Department official that it 
will fully comply with this subpart.
    (g) Post-termination proceedings. (1) An applicant or recipient 
adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this 
section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal 
financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that 
order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with 
this subpart and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply 
with this subpart.
    (2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order 
entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time 
request the responsible Department official to restore fully its 
eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request 
shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or 
recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. 
If the responsible Department official denies any such request, the 
applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, 
specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. It shall 
thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the 
record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the responsible 
Department official. The applicant or recipient will be restored to such 
eligibility if it proves at such a hearing that it satisfied the 
requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings 
under this paragraph are pending, sanctions imposed by the order issued 
under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.

    Action taken pursuant to section 602 of the Act is subject to 
judicial review as provided in section 603 of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 42.112  Effect on other regulations; forms and instructions.

    (a) Effect on other regulations. Nothing in this subpart shall be 
deemed to supersede any provision of subpart A or B of this part or 
Executive Order 11114 or 11246, as amended, or of any other regulation 
or instruction which prohibits discrimination on the ground of race, 
color, or national origin in any program or situation to which this 
subpart is inapplicable, or which prohibits discrimination on any other 
ground.
    (b) Forms and instructions. Each responsible Department official, 
other than the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General, shall issue 
and promptly make available to interested persons forms and detailed 
instructions and procedures for effectuating this subpart as applied to 
programs to which this subpart applies and for which he is responsible.
    (c) Supervision and coordination. The Attorney General may from time 
to time assign to officials of the Department, or to officials of other 
departments or agencies of the Government, with the consent of such 
departments or agencies, responsibilities in connection with the 
effectuation of the purposes of title VI of the Act and this subpart 
(other than responsibility for final decision as provided in Sec. 
42.110(e)), including the achievement of the effective coordination and 
maximum uniformity within the Department and within the Executive Branch 
of the Government in the application of title VI of the Act and this 
subpart to similar programs and in similar situations. Any action taken, 
determination made, or requirement imposed by an official of another 
Department or agency acting pursuant to an assignment of responsibility 
under this subsection shall have the same effect as though such action 
had been taken by the Attorney General.

3789d(c); title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d; and 
title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. 1681, et seq., 
to the end that no person in any State shall on the ground of

race, color, national origin, sex, or religion be excluded from 
participation in, be denied the benefits of, be subjected to 
discrimination under, or be denied employment in connection with any 
program or activity funded in whole or in part with funds made available 
under either the Justice System Improvement Act or the Juvenile Justice 
Act by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, the National 
Institute of Justice, or the Bureau of Justice Statistics. These 
regulations also implement Executive Order 12138, which requires all 
Federal agencies awarding financial assistance to take certain steps to 
advance women's business enterprise.
    (b) The regulations in this subpart apply to the delivery of

Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, as amended.
    (c) Where a private recipient which receives such assistance through 
a unit of government is engaged in prohibited discrimination, the Office 
of Justice Assistance, Research, and Statistics will invoke the 
enforcement procedures of this subpart (Sec. 42.208, et seq.) against 
the appropriate unit of government for failure to enforce the assurances 
of nondiscrimination given it by the private recipient pursuant to Sec. 
42.204(a). Where a private recipient receives assistance either directly 
from the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, the National 
Institute of Justice, or the Bureau of Justice Statistics or through 
another private entity which receives funds directly from one of those 
agencies, compliance will be enforced pursuant to section 803(a) of the

persons of certain national origins, such as persons of Hispanic or

able to demonstrate convincingly, through use of supportive factual 
data, that the requirement has been validated as set forth in the 
Department of Justice Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, 28 
CFR 50.14.
    (e) A recipient, in determining the type of disposition, services, 
financial aid, benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any 
program, or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in 
which, such will be provided under any program, may not directly or 
through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods 
of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to 
discrimination under section 815(c)(1) of the JSIA, or have the effect

persons of a particular race, color, religion, national origin, or sex.
    (j) Nothing contained in this subpart shall be construed as 
requiring any recipient to adopt a percentage ratio, quota system, or 
other program to achieve racial balance. The use of goals and timetables 
is not use of a quota prohibited by this section.

appropriate chief executive of:
    (1) The program or activity determined to be in noncompliance;
    (2) The general legal and factual basis for its determination;
    (3) The Office's request to secure compliance;
    (4) The action to be taken by the Office and the provisions of law 
under which the proposed action is to be taken should the chief 
executive fail to secure compliance; and
    (5) The right of the recipient to request a preliminary hearing, 
pursuant to Sec. 42.212, and a full hearing, pursuant to Sec. 42.213.


<R05>
Sec. 42.209  Compliance secured.

    (a) In the event a chief executive secures compliance after notice 
pursuant to Sec. 42.208, the terms and conditions with which the 
affected State government or unit of general local government agrees to 
comply shall be set forth in writing and signed by the chief executive 
of the State, by the chief executive of such unit (in the event of a 
violation by a unit of general local government), and by the Director of 
OJARS.
    (b) Prior to the effective date of the agreement, the Office shall 
send a copy of the agreement to each complainant, if any, with respect 
to such violation, and to the appropriate CJC.
    (c) The chief executive of the State, or the chief executive of the 
unit (in the event of a violation by a unit of general local government) 
shall file semi-annual reports with the Office detailing the steps taken 
to comply with the agreement.
    (d) Within 15 days of receipt of such reports, the Office shall send 
a copy to each complainant, if any.
    (e) The Director of OJARS shall also determine a recipient to be in 
compliance if it complies fully with the final order or judgement of a 
Federal or State court, pursuant to Sec. 42.211 (a)(2) and (b), or if 
found by such court to be in compliance with section 815(c)(1).


<R05>
Sec. 42.210  Compliance not secured.

    (a) If, at the conclusion of 90 days after notification of 
noncompliance with section 815(c)(1):
    (1) Compliance has not been secured by the chief executive of that 
State or the chief executive of that unit of general local government; 
and
    (2) An administrative law judge has not made a determination under 
Sec. 42.212 that it is likely the State government or unit of local 
government will prevail on the merits;

the Office shall notify the Attorney General that compliance has not 
been secured and shall cause to have suspended further payment of any 
funds under the JSIA or Juvenile Justice

[[Page 814]]

Act, as appropriate, to the specific program or activity in which the 
noncompliance has been found.
    (b) If a hearing is requested pursuant to Sec. 42.213, the 
suspension of funds shall be effective for a period of not more than 30 
days after the conclusion of the hearing, or in the absence of a hearing 
under Sec. 42.213, funds shall be suspended for not more than 120 days, 
unless there has been an express finding by the Director of OJARS after 
notice and opportunity for such a hearing, that the recipient is not in 
compliance with section 815(c)(1) of the JSIA, or this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 42.211  Resumption of suspended funds.

    (a) Payment of suspended funds made available under the JSIA or the 
Juvenile Justice Act shall resume only if--
    (1) Such State government or unit of general local government enters 
into a compliance agreement signed by the Director of OJARS in 
accordance with Sec. 42.209;
    (2) Such State government or unit of general local government:
    (i) Complies fully with the final order or judgment of a Federal or 
State court, if that order or judgement covers all matters raised by the 
Director of OJARS in the notice pursuant to Sec. 42.208, or
    (ii) Is found to be in compliance with section 815(c)(1) of the JSIA 
by such court;
    (3) After a hearing, the Director of OJARS, pursuant to Sec. 
42.213, finds that noncompliance has not been demonstrated; or
    (4) An administrative law judge has determined, under Sec. 42.212, 
that it is likely that the State government or unit of local government 
will prevail on the merits.
    (b) Full compliance with a court order, for the purposes of 
paragraph (2) of this section, includes the securing of an agreement to 
comply over a period of time, particularly in complex cases or where 
compliance would require an extended period of time for implementation.


<R05>
Sec. 42.212  Preliminary hearing.

    (a) Prior to the suspension of funds under Sec. 42.210(a), but 
within the 90-day period after notification under Sec. 42.208, the 
State government or unit of local government may request an expedited 
preliminary hearing on the record in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 554 in 
order to determine whether it is likely that the State government or 
unit of local government would, at a full hearing under Sec. 42.213, 
prevail on the merits on the issue of the alleged noncompliance.
    (b) The preliminary hearing shall be initiated within 30 days of 
request. The ALJ shall make his finding within 15 days after the 
conclusion of the preliminary hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 42.213  Full hearing.

    (a) At any time after notification of noncompliance under Sec. 
42.208, but before the conclusion of the 120-day suspension period 
referred to in Sec. 42.210, a State government or unit of general local 
government may request a hearing on the record in accordance with 5 
U.S.C. 554 in order to contest the findings of determination of 
noncompliance made under Sec. 42.208. The Office shall initiate the 
hearing within 60 days of request.
    (b) Within 30 days after the conclusion of the hearing, or, in the 
absence of a hearing, at the conclusion of the 120-day period referred 
to in Sec. 42.210, the Director of OJARS shall make a finding of 
compliance or noncompliance.
    (1) If the Director makes a finding of noncompliance, the Director 
shall:
    (i) Notify the Attorney General in order that the Attorney General 
may institute a civil action under section 815(c)(3) of the JSIA;
    (ii) Cause to have terminated the payment of funds under the JSIA 
and/or the Juvenile Justice Act; and
    (iii) If appropriate, seek repayment of funds.
    (2) If the Director makes a finding of compliance, payment of the 
suspended funds and reconsideration of applications shall resume.


<R05>
Sec. 42.214  Judicial review.

    Any State government or unit of general local government aggrieved 
by a final determination of the Office under Sec. 42.213 may appeal 
such determination as provided in section 805 of the JSIA.

[[Page 815]]


<R05>
Sec. 42.215  Other actions authorized under the JSIA.

    (a) The Director of OJARS may, at any time, request the Attorney 
General to file suit to enforce compliance with section 815(c)(1). OJARS 
will monitor the litigation through the court docket and liaison with 
the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. Where the 
litigation does not result in timely resolution of the matter, and funds 
have not been suspended pursuant to Sec. 42.215(b), OJARS will 
institute administrative proceedings unless enjoined from doing so by 
the court.
    (b)(1) Whenever the Attorney General files a civil action alleging a 
pattern or practice of discriminatory conduct on the basis of race, 
color, religion, national origin, or sex in any program or activity of a 
State government or unit of local government which State government or 
unit of local government receives funds made available under the JSIA or 
the Juvenile Justice Act and the conduct allegedly violates or would 
violate the provisions of this subpart or section 815(c)(1) of the JSIA 
and neither party within 45 days after such filing has been granted such 
preliminary relief with regard to the suspension or payment of funds as 
may otherwise be available by law, the Director of OJARS shall suspend 
further payment of any funds under the JSIA and the Juvenile Justice Act 
to that specific program or activity alleged by the Attorney General to 
be in violation of the provisions of section 815(c)(1) of the JSIA until 
such time as the court orders resumption of payment.
    (2) The Office expects that preliminary relief authorized by this 
subsection will not be granted unless the party making application for 
such relief meets the standards for a preliminary injunction.
    (c)(1) Whenever a State government or unit of local government or 
any officer or employee thereof acting in an official capacity, has 
engaged or is engaging in any act or practice prohibited by section 
815(c)(1) of the JSIA, a civil action may be instituted after exhaustion 
of administrative remedies by the person aggrieved in an appropriate 
U.S. District Court or in a State court or general jurisdiction.
    (2) Administrative remedies shall be deemed to be exhausted upon the 
expiration of 60 days after the date the administrative complaint was 
filed with the Office or any other administrative enforcement agency, 
unless within such period there has been a determination by the Office 
or the agency on the merits of the complaint, in which case such 
remedies shall be deemed exhausted at the time the determination becomes 
final.
    (3) The Attorney General, or a specifically designated assistant for 
or in the name of the United States may intervene upon timely 
application in any civil action brought to enforce compliance with 
section 815(c)(1) of the JSIA if he certifies that the action is of 
general public importance. In such action the United States shall be 
entitled to the same relief as if it had instituted the action.

             Appendix A to Subpart D of Part 42--Commentary

    Section 42.201(c). The compliance enforcement mechanism of section 
815(c)(2) applies by its terms to State and local government. The 
prohibitions in section 815(c)(1), however, apply to all recipients of 
OJARS assistance. Accordingly, where a private entity which has received 
LEAA, NIJ, or BJS assistance through a State or local unit of government 
is determined by OJARS to be in non-compliance, OJARS will invoke the 
section 815(c)(2) mechanism against the appropriate unit of government 
for its failure to enforce the assurances of compliance given it by the 
private recipient, unless the unit has initiated its own compliance 
action against the private recipient. The fund termination procedures of 
section 803(a) will be invoked against non-complying private recipients 
which receive assistance directly from LEAA, NIJ, or BJS, or through 
another private entity.
    Section 42.202(g). Section 815(c)(1) of the JSIA limits suspension 
and termination of assistance in the event of noncompliance to the 
``programs or activity'' in which the noncompliance is found. The phrase 
``program or activity'' was first used in section 815(c)(1) of the Crime 
Control Act of 1976, the substantially identical predecessor to section 
815(c)(1).
    House Report No. 94-1155 (94th Congress, 2d Session), at p. 26, 
explained the provision as follows:
    ``Suspension may be limited to the specific program or activity 
found to have discriminated, rather than all of the recipients' LEAA 
funds.

[[Page 816]]

    ``For example, if discriminatory employment practices in a city's 
police department were cited in the notification, LEAA may only suspend 
that part of the city's payments which fund the police department. LEAA 
may not suspend the city's LEAA funds which are used in the city courts, 
prisons, or juvenile justice agencies.''

This passage makes it clear that OJARS need not demonstrate a nexus 
between the particular project funded and the discriminatory activity. 
See Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563, 566 (1974).
    Sections 42.203(b) and 42.203(e-i). These provisions are derived 
from 28 CFR 42.104(b) of subpart C of the Department of Justice 
Nondiscrimination Regulations. Where appropriate ``sex'' and 
``religion'' have been added as prohibited grounds of discrimination, 
and ``denial of employment'' as another activity within the scope of 
section 815(c)(1).
    Individual projects benefiting a particular sex, race, or ethnic 
group are not violative of section 815(c)(1) unless the granting agency 
or the recipient has engaged in a pattern of granting preferential 
treatment to one such group, and cannot justify the preference on the 
basis of a compelling governmental interest, in the case of racial or 
ethnic discrimination, or a substantial relationship to an important 
governmental function, in the case of sex discrimination.
    Section 42.203(b)(10). On August 25, 1978, the Department of 
Justice, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of 
Labor and the then-Civil Service Commission published the Uniform 
Employee Selection Guidelines codified at 28 CFR 50.14. Since OJARS is a 
component of the Department, these guidelines are applicable to the 
selection procedures of LEAA, NIJ, and BJS recipients. See 44 FR 11996 
(March 2, 1979) for a detailed commentary on the guidelines.
    Section 42.203(c). In the Conference Report on section 518(c) of the 
Crime Control Act (the substantially identical predecessor of section 
815(c)), the managers stated that ``In the area of employment cases 
brought under this section, it is intended by the conferees that the 
standards of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 apply.'' H. Rept. 
No. 94-1723 (94th Cong., 2d Sess.) at p. 32.
    This section makes the OJARS standards of employment discrimination 
consistent with those used by the Civil Rights Division of the 
Department of Justice. It further clarifies that the burden shifts to 
the employer to validate its selection procedures once OJARS has 
demonstrated that those procedures disproportionately exclude an 
affected class. Discriminatory purpose on the part of the employer, 
which must be shown before the burden shifts in a Fourteenth Amendment 
case such as Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 96 S. Ct. 2040 (1976), 
need not be shown in an employment discrimination case brought under 
section 815(c)(1).
    Section 42.203(j). Section 815(b) of the JSIA reads:
    ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law, nothing contained in 
this title shall be construed to authorize the National Institute of 
Justice, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, or the Law Enforcement 
Assistance Administration (1) to require, or condition the availability 
or amount of a grant upon the adoption by an applicant or grantee under 
this title of a percentage ratio, quota system, or other program to 
achieve racial balance in any criminal justice agency; or (2) to deny or 
discontinue a grant because of the refusal of an applicant or grantee 
under this title to adopt such a ratio, system, or other program.''
    In commenting on the Crime Control Act of 1976, Senator Roman Hruska 
of Nebraska explained the difference between quotas and goals and 
timetables as follows:
    ``Section 518(b) [now 815(b)] of the act prohibits the setting of 
quotas. This provision was unchanged, and this provision will still bind 
the Administration.
    ``LEAA does have an affirmative obligation under this law to seek to 
eliminate discriminatory practices, voluntarily, if possible, prior to 
resorting to fund termination. LEAA can request that a recipient 
eliminate the effect of past discrimination by requiring the recipient 
to commit itself to goals and timetables. The formulation of goals is 
not a quota prohibited by section 518(b) of the act. A goal is a 
numerical objective fixed realistically in terms of the number of 
vacancies expected and the number of qualified applicants available. 
Factors such as a lower attrition rate than expected, bona fide fiscal 
restraints, or a lack of qualified applicants would be acceptable 
reasons for not meeting a goal that has been established and no 
sanctions would accrue under the program.'' Cong. Rec. S 17320 
(September 30, 1976, daily ed.).
    The Senate Judiciary Committee Report on the JSIA also emphasized 
that section 815(b) does not ``undercut subsection (c) in any way; 
subsection (b) has been interpreted so as not to limit LEAA's anti-
discrimination enforcement capabilities. Indeed, recent court decisions 
have made this abundantly clear. See, e.g., United States v. City of Los 
Angeles, No. 77-3460 (C.D. Cal. 2/1/79).'' S. Rept. 96-142, p. 57.
    See also the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Affirmative 
Action Guidelines, 44 FR 4422 (January 19, 1979).
    Section 42.204. All grantees and subgrantees must make the 
assurances found in paragraph (a). Only State and local units of 
government and agencies thereof must make the assurance found in 
paragraph (c), since, as explained in the commentary on Sec. 42.201(c), 
the enforcement provisions of section

[[Page 817]]

815(c)(2) apply only to governmental recipients.
    Section 42.205(a). Where information available to the Office clearly 
and convincingly demonstrates that the complaint is frivolous or 
otherwise without merit, the complaint will not be investigated, and the 
complainant will be so advised.
    Section 42.205(b). A one-year timeliness requirement is imposed to 
ensure that OJARS will be devoting its resources to the resolution of 
active issues, and to maximize the possibility that necessary witnesses 
and evidence are still available.
    Examples of good cause which would clearly warrant an extension of 
the filing period are a statement from the complainant stating that he 
or she was unware of the discrimination until after a year had passed, 
or that he or she was not aware that a remedy was available through 
OJARS.
    Section 42.205(c)(1). Jurisdiction exists if the complaint alleges 
discrimination on a ground prohibited by section 815(c)(1), if the 
recipient was receiving funds at the time of the discrimination, and the 
respondent named in the complaint is a current recipient of LEAA, NIJ, 
or BJS assistance.
    Prior to a determination of noncompliance, OJARS will attempt to 
negotiate voluntary compliance only during the 30-day period following 
receipt of the Office's preliminary findings, and only at the request of 
the recipient, as provided in Sec. 42.205(c)(3). If a determination of 
noncompliance is made, OJARS will participate in voluntary compliance 
efforts during the 90-day period following the letter sent to the chief 
executive(s) under section 42.208.
    Sections 42.205(c) (3) and (4) and 42.206(e). OJARS will notify the 
appropriate chief executive(s) of its recommendations during the 
voluntary resolution phase of both the complaint investigation and 
compliance review process. OJARS expects that the early involvement of 
the chief executive will often expedite the resolution of issues.
    Section 42.205(c)(5). OJARS will initiate an investigation if the 
litigation discussed in this subparagraph becomes protracted or 
apparently will not resolve the matter within a reasonable time.
    Section 42.205(c)(6). In order to effectively utilize the resources 
of other agencies, and to avoid duplication of effort, OJARS may request 
another agency to act on a particular complaint. OJARS expects this 
practice to be limited, and will attempt to ensure that any cooperative 
agreement reached with another agency is consistent with the timetables 
set forth in Sec. 42.205(c).
    Section 42.206(a). OJARS recognizes the practical impossibility of 
reviewing the compliance of each of its more than 39,000 recipients. The 
regulations seek to expedite the review process by reducing its length 
and narrowing its focus. Compliance reviews may, in some instances, be 
limited to specific employment practices, or other functions of a 
recipient, that appear to have the greatest adverse impact on an 
affected class.
    Section 42.206(b). The factors listed will be considered 
cumulatively by OJARS in selecting recipients for reviews. OJARS will 
consider data from all sources, including information provided by both 
internal and external auditors.
    Section 42.208(b). Upon receipt of the publications listed, OJARS 
will review the case reports for findings that may be violations of 
section 815(c)(1). In the case of the West Publishing Company reporters, 
OJARS will consult the topic ``Civil Rights'' in the Key Number Digests 
contained in the advance sheets.
    Section 42.208(e). This subsection sets forth the minimum procedural 
safeguards that OJARS would require of an administrative hearing to 
assure the process was consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act. 
The sufficiency of other procedures that may vary in form but insure due 
process and the same opportunity for a fair hearing of both parties' 
evidence will be determined by OJARS on a case-by-case basis.
    The Office will compile a list of State agencies whose procedures 
have been found consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act, and a 
list of State agencies whose procedures have been found inconsistent. 
When a finding of an agency not on either list is received, the Office 
will attempt to reliably determine the procedures used to render the 
findings.
    Section 42.209(a). Although the signature of the appropriate chief 
executives are ultimately required on the compliance agreement, these 
regulations do not preclude them from delegating the responsibility for 
securing compliance during the 90-day period following notification, to 
State or local administrative or human rights agencies under their 
respective authority. A compliance agreement may be an agreement to 
comply over a period of time, particularly in complex cases or where 
compliance would require an extended period of time for implementation.
    Section 42.209(b). The regulations require that a copy of the 
proposed compliance agreement be sent to the complainant, if any, before 
the effective date of the agreement. Although the Act would permit a 
copy to be sent as late as the effective date, OJARS believes the 
compliance agreement would be more likely to resolve all concerns and 
discourage litigation if the complainant's views were considered before 
it took effect.
    Section 42.211(b). An example of a case where compliance would 
require an extended period of time for implementation would be a court 
order setting a goal of five years for

[[Page 818]]

an employer to raise the percentage of minorities in its workforce to 
parity with the percentage of minorities in the relevant geographical 
labor force.
    Section 42.213. The full hearing will be conducted in accordance 
with JSIA Hearing and Appeal Procedures, 28 CFR 18.1, et seq.
    Section 42.215(a). In a December 20, 1976 letter to the 
Administrator of LEAA, Congressman Peter Rodino, Chairman of the House 
Judiciary Committee, commented on the regulations proposed to implement 
the substantially identical nondiscrimination provisions of the Crime 
Control Act. He advised the Administrator that ``the committee 
intentionally omitted the word `refer' from the law to ensure that LEAA 
would always retain administrative jurisdiction over a complaint filed 
with them. It is not appropriate for LEAA to refer cases to the Civil 
Rights Division or other Federal or State agencies without monitoring 
the case for prompt resolution.''
    Section 42.215(c)(2). The exhaustion of administrative remedies at 
the end of 60 days (unless the Office has made a determination) does not 
limit OJARS' authority to investigate a complaint after the expiration 
of that period. OJARS will continue to investigate the complaint after 
the end of the 60-day period, if necessary, in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 42.205.

        Subpart E_Equal Employment Opportunity Program Guidelines

    Authority: Sec. 501 of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets 
Act of 1968, Pub. L. 90-351, 82 Stat. 197, as amended.

    Source: 43 FR 28802, June 30, 1978, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 42.301  Purpose.

    The experience of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration in 
implementing its responsibilities under the Omnibus Crime Control and 
Safe Streets Act of 1968, as amended (Pub. L. 90-351, 82 Stat. 197; Pub. 
L. 91-644, 84 Stat. 1881) has demonstrated that the full and equal 
participation of women and minority individuals in employment 
opportunities in the criminal justice system is a necessary component to 
the Safe Streets Act's program to reduce crime and delinquency in the 
United States.


<R05>
Sec. 42.302  Application.

    (a) Recipient means any State or local unit of government or agency 
thereof, and any private entity, institution, or organization, to which 
Federal financial assistance is extended directly, or through such 
government or agency, but such term does not include any ultimate 
beneficiary of such assistance.
    (b) The obligation of a recipient to formulate, implement, and 
maintain an equal employment opportunity program, in accordance with 
this subpart, extends to State and local police agencies, correctional 
agencies, criminal court systems, probation and parole agencies, and 
similar agencies responsible for the reduction and control of crime and 
delinquency.
    (c) Assignments of compliance responsibility for title VI of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964 have been made by the Department of Justice to 
the Department of Health and Human Services, covering educational 
institutions and general hospital or medical facilities. Similarly, the 
Department of Labor, in pursuance of its authority under Executive 
Orders 11246 and 11375, has assigned responsibility for monitoring equal 
employment opportunity under government contracts with medical and 
educational institutions, and non-profit organizations, to the 
Department of Health and Human Services. Accordingly, monitoring 
responsibility in compliance matters in agencies of the kind mentioned 
in this paragraph rests with the Department of Health and Human 
Services, and agencies of this kind are exempt from the provisions of 
this subpart, and are not responsible for the development of equal 
employment opportunity programs in accordance herewith.
    (d) Each recipient of LEAA assistance within the criminal justice 
system which has 50 or more employees and which has received grants or 
subgrants of $25,000 or more pursuant to and since the enactment of the 
Safe Streets Act of 1968, as amended, and which has a service population 
with a minority representation of 3 percent or more, is required to 
formulate, implement and maintain an equal employment opportunity 
program relating to employment practices affecting minority persons and 
women within 120 days after either the promulgation of these amended 
guidelines, or the initial application for assistance is approved, 
whichever is sooner. Where a recipient

[[Page 819]]

has 50 or more employees, and has received grants or subgrants of 
$25,000 or more, and has a service population with a minority 
representation of less than 3 percent, such recipient is required to 
formulate, implement, and maintain an equal employment opportunity 
program relating to employment practices affecting women. For a 
definition of ``employment practices'' within the meaning of this 
paragraph, see Sec. 42.202(c).
    (e) Minority persons shall include persons who are Black, not of 
Hispanic origin; Asian or Pacific Islanders; American Indians or Alaskan 
Native; or Hispanics. These categories are defined at 28 CFR 42.402(e).
    (f) Fiscal year means the 12 calendar months beginning October 1, 
and ending September 30, of the following calendar year. A fiscal year 
is designated by the calendar year in which it ends.

[43 FR 28802, June 30, 1978, as amended by Order No. 960-81, 46 FR 
52357, Oct. 27, 1981]


<R05>
Sec. 42.303  Evaluation of employment opportunities.

    (a) A necessary prerequisite to the development and implementation 
of a satisfactory equal employment opportunity program is the 
identification and analysis of any problem areas inherent in the 
utilization or participation of minorities and women in all of the 
recipient's employment phases (e.g., recruitment, selection, and 
promotion) and the evaluation of employment opportunities for minorities 
and women.
    (b) In many cases an effective equal employment opportunity program 
may only be accomplished where the program is coordinated by the 
recipient agency with the cognizant Office of Personnel Management or 
similar agency responsible by law, in whole or in part, for the 
recruitment and selection of entrance candidates and selection of 
candidates for promotion.
    (c) In making the evaluation of employment opportunities, the 
recipient shall conduct such analysis separately for minorities and 
women. However, all racial and ethnic data collected to perform an 
evaluation pursuant to the requirements of this section should be cross 
classified by sex to ascertain the extent to which minority women or 
minority men may be underutilized. The evaluation should include but not 
necessarily be limited to, the following factors:
    (1) An analysis of present representation of women and minority 
persons in all job categories;
    (2) An analysis of all recruitment and employment selection 
procedures for the preceding fiscal year, including such things as 
position descriptions, application forms, recruitment methods and 
sources, interview procedures, test administration and test validity, 
educational prerequisites, referral procedures and final selection 
methods, to insure that equal employment opportunity is being afforded 
in all job categories;
    (3) An analysis of seniority practices and provisions, upgrading and 
promotion procedures, transfer procedures (lateral or vertical), and 
formal and informal training programs during the preceding fiscal year, 
in order to insure that equal employment opportunity is being afforded;
    (4) A reasonable assessment to determine whether minority employment 
is inhibited by external factors such as the lack of access to suitable 
housing in the geographical area served by a certain facility or the 
lack of suitable transportation (public or private) to the workplace.

<R05>
Sec. 42.304  Written equal employment opportunity program.

    Each recipient's equal employment opportunity program shall be in 
writing and shall include:
    (a) A job classification table or chart which clearly indicates for 
each job classification or assignment the number of employees within 
each respective job category classified by race, sex and national origin 
(include for example Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander, and American 
Indian or Alaskan Native). Also, principal duties and rates of pay 
should be clearly indicated for each job classification. Where auxiliary 
duties are assigned or more than one rate of pay applies because of 
length of time in the job or other factors, a special notation should be 
made. Where the recipient operates more than one

[[Page 820]]

shift or assigns employees within each shift to varying locations, as in 
law enforcement agencies, the number by race, sex and national origin on 
each shift and in each location should be identified. When relevant, the 
recipient should indicate the racial/ethnic mix of the geographic area 
of assignments by the inclusion of minority population and percentage 
statistics.
    (b) The number of disciplinary actions taken against employees by 
race, sex and national origin within the preceding fiscal year, the 
number and types of sanctions imposed (suspension indefinitely, 
suspension for a term, loss of pay, written reprimand, oral reprimand, 
other) against individuals by race, sex and national origin.
    (c) The number of individuals by race, sex and national origin (if 
available) applying for employment within the preceding fiscal year and 
the number by race, sex and national origin (if available) of those 
applicants who were offered employment and those who were actually 
hired. If such data is unavailable, the recipient should institute a 
system for the collection of such data.
    (d) The number of employees in each job category by race, sex and 
national origin who made application for promotion or transfer within 
the preceding fiscal year and the number in each job category by race, 
sex, and national origin who were promoted or transferred.
    (e) The number of employees by race, sex, and national origin who 
were terminated within the preceding fiscal year, identifying by race, 
sex, and national origin which were voluntary and involuntary 
terminations.
    (f) Available community and area labor characteristics within the 
relevant geographical area including total population, workforce and 
existing unemployment by race, sex and national origin. Such data may be 
obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Washington, DC, State and 
local employment services, or other reliable sources. Recipient should 
identify the sources of the data used.
    (g) A detailed narrative statement setting forth the recipient's 
existing employment policies and practices as defined in Sec. 
42.202(c). Thus, for example, where testing is used in the employment 
selection process, it is not sufficient for the recipient to simply note 
the fact. The recipient should identify the test, describe the 
procedures followed in administering and scoring the test, state what 
weight is given to test scores, how a cut-off score is established and 
whether the test has been validated to predict or measure job 
performance and, if so, a detailed description of the validation study. 
Similarly detailed responses are required with respect to other 
employment policies, procedures, and practices used by the applicant.
    (1) The statement should include the recipient's detailed analysis 
of existing employment policies, procedures, and practices as they 
relate to employment of minorities and women (see Sec. 42.303) and, 
where improvements are necessary, the statement should set forth in 
detail the specific steps the recipient will take for the achievement of 
full and equal employment opportunity. The Department of Justice 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, 28 CFR part 50, set out the 
appropriate standards for nondiscriminatory selection procedures. 
Recipients of LEAA assistance using selection procedures which are not 
in conformity with the Department of Justice guidelines shall set forth 
the specific areas of nonconformity, the reasons which may explain any 
such nonconformity, and if necessary, the steps the recipient agency 
will take to correct any existing deficiency.
    (2) The recipient should also set forth a program for recruitment of 
minority persons based on an informed judgment of what is necessary to 
attract minority applications including, but not necessarily limited to, 
dissemination of posters, use of advertising media patronized by 
minorities, minority group contacts and community relations programs. As 
appropriate, recipients may wish to refer to recruitment techniques 
suggested in revised order No. 4 of the Office of Federal Contract 
Compliance, U.S. Department of Labor, found at 41 CFR 60-2.24(e).

[[Page 821]]

    (h) Plan for dissemination of the applicant's Equal Employment 
Opportunity Program to all personnel, applicants and the general public. 
As appropriate, recipients may wish to refer to the recommendations for 
dissemination of policy suggested in revised order No. 4 of the Office 
of Federal Contract Compliance, U.S. Department of Labor, found at 41 
CFR 60-2.21.
    (i) Designation of specified personnel to implement and maintain 
adherence to the equal employment opportunity program and a description 
of their specific responsibilities suggested in revised order No. 4 of 
the Office of Federal Contract Compliance, U.S. Department of Labor, 
found at 41 CFR 60-2.22.


<R05>
Sec. 42.305  Recordkeeping and certification.

    The equal employment opportunity program and all records used in its 
preparation shall be kept on file and retained by each recipient covered 
by these guidelines for subsequent audit or review by responsible 
personnel of the cognizant State planning agency or the LEAA. Prior to 
the authorization to fund new or continuing programs under the Omnibus 
Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, the recipient shall file a 
certificate with the cognizant State planning agency or with the LEAA 
Office of Civil Rights Compliance stating that the equal employment 
opportunity program is on file with the recipient. This form of the 
certification shall be as follows:

    I, ---------- (person filing the application) certify that the ----
------ (criminal justice agency) has formulated an equal employment 
program in accordance with 28 CFR 42.301, et seq., subpart E, and that 
it is on file in the Office of ---------- (name), ---------- (address), 
---------- (title), for review or audit by officials of the cognizant 
State planning agency or the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration 
as required by relevant laws and regulations.


The criminal justice agency created by the Governor to implement the 
Safe Streets Act within each State shall certify that it requires, as a 
condition of the receipt of block grant funds, that recipients from it 
have executed an Equal Employment Opportunity Program in accordance with 
this subpart, or that, in conformity with the terms and conditions of 
this regulation no equal employment opportunity programs are required to 
be filed by that jurisdiction.


<R05>
Sec. 42.306  Guidelines.

    (a) Recipient agencies are expected to conduct a continuing program 
of self-evaluation to ascertain whether any of their recruitment, 
employee selection or promotional policies (or lack thereof) directly or 
indirectly have the effect of denying equal employment opportunities to 
minority individuals and women.
    (b) Equal employment program modification may be suggested by LEAA 
whenever identifiable referral or selection procedures and policies 
suggest to LEAA the appropriateness of improved selection procedures and 
policies. Accordingly, any recipient agencies falling within this 
category are encouraged to develop recruitment, hiring or promotional 
guidelines under their equal employment opportunity program which will 
correct, in a timely manner, any identifiable employment impediments 
which may have contributed to the existing disparities.


<R05>
Sec. 42.307  Obligations of recipients.

    The obligation of those recipients subject to these guidelines for 
the maintenance of an equal employment opportunity program shall 
continue for the period during which the LEAA assistance is extended to 
a recipient or for the period during which a comprehensive law 
enforcement plan filed pursuant to the Safe Streets Act is in effect 
within the State, whichever is longer, unless the assurances of 
compliance, filed by a recipient in accordance with Sec. 42.204(a)(2), 
specify a different period.


<R05>
Sec. 42.308  Noncompliance.

    Failure to implement and maintain an equal employment opportunity 
program as required by these guidelines shall subject recipients of LEAA 
assistance to the sanctions prescribed by the Safe Streets Act and the 
equal employment opportunity regulations of the Department of Justice. 
(See 42 U.S.C. 3757 and 28 CFR 42.207.)

Subpart F_Coordination of Enforcement of Non-discrimination in Federally 
                            Assisted Programs

    Authority: Executive Order 12250.

    Source: Order No. 670-76, 41 FR 52669, Dec. 1, 1976, unless 
otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 42.401  Purpose and application.

    The purpose of this subpart is to insure that federal agencies which 
extend financial assistance properly enforce title VI of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 and similar provisions in federal grant statutes. 
Enforcement of the latter statutes is covered by this subpart to the 
extent that they relate to prohibiting discrimination on the ground of 
race, color or national origin in programs receiving federal financial 
assistance of the type subject to title VI. Responsibility for enforcing 
title VI rests with the federal agencies which extend financial 
assistance. In accord with the authority granted the Attorney General 
under Executive Order 12250, this subpart shall govern the respective 
obligations of federal agencies regarding enforcement of title VI. This 
subpart is to be used in conjunction with the 1965 Attorney General 
Guidelines for Enforcement of title VI, 28 CFR 50.3.

[Order No. 670-76, 41 FR 52669, Dec. 1, 1976, as amended by Order No. 
960-81, 46 FR 52357, Oct. 27, 1981]


<R05>
Sec. 42.402  Definitions.

    For purpose of this subpart:
    (a) Title VI refers to title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 
U.S.C. 2000d to 2000d-4. Where appropriate, this term also refers to the 
civil rights provisions of other federal statutes to the extent that 
they prohibit discrimination on the ground of race, color or national 
origin in programs receiving federal financial assistance of the type 
subject to title VI itself.
    (b) Agency or federal agency refers to any federal department or 
agency which extends federal financial assistance of the type subject to 
title VI.
    (c) Program refers to programs and activities receiving federal 
financial assistance of the type subject to title VI.
    (d) Assistant Attorney General refers to the Assistant Attorney 
General, Civil Rights Division, United States Department of Justice.
    (e) Where designation of persons by race, color or national origin 
is required, the following designations shall be used:
    (1) Black, not of Hispanic Origin. A person having origins in any of 
the black racial groups of Africa.
    (2) Hispanic. A person of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or 
South American or other Spanish Culture or origin, regardless of race.
    (3) Asian or Pacific Islander. A person having origins in any of the 
original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, the Indian 
Subcontinent, or the Pacific Islands. This area includes, for example, 
China, Japan, Korea, the Philippine Islands, and Samoa.

any of the original peoples of North America, and who maintain cultural 
identification through tribal affiliation or community recognition.
    (5) White, not of Hispanic Origin. A person having origins in any of 
the original people of Europe, North Africa, or the Middle East. 
Additional sub-categories based on national origin or primary language 
spoken may be used where appropriate, on either a national or a regional 
basis. Paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(5) of this section, inclusive, set 
forth in this section are in conformity with the OMB Ad Hoc Committee on 
Race/Ethnic Categories' recommendations. To the extent that said 
designations are modified by the OMB Ad Hoc Committee, paragraphs (e)(1) 
through (e)(5) of this section, inclusive, set forth in this section 
shall be interpreted to conform with those modifications.
    (f) Covered employment means employment practices covered by title 
VI. Such practices are those which:
    (1) Exist in a program where a primary objective of the federal 
financial assistance is to provide employment, or

<R05>
Sec. 42.403  Agency regulations.

    (a) Any federal agency subject to title VI which has not issued a 
regulation implementing title VI shall do so as promptly as possible 
and, no later than the effective date of this subpart, shall submit a 
proposed regulation to the Assistant Attorney General pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) Any federal agency which becomes subject to title VI after the 
effective date of this subpart shall, within 60 days of the date it 
becomes subject to title VI, submit a proposed regulation to the 
Assistant Attorney General pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Regarding issuance or amendment of its regulation implementing 
title VI, a federal agency shall take the following steps:
    (1) Before publishing a proposed regulation of amendment in the 
Federal Register, submit it to the Assistant Attorney General, Civil 
Rights Division;
    (2) After receiving the approval of the Assistant Attorney General, 
publish the proposed regulation or amendment in the Federal Register for 
comment;
    (3) After final agency approval, submit the regulation or amendment, 
through the Assistant Attorney General, to the Attorney General for 
final approval. (Executive Order 12250 delegates to the Attorney General 
the function, vested in the President by section 602 of title VI, 42 
U.S.C. 2000d-1, of approving title VI regulations and amendments to 
them.)
    (d) The title VI regulation of each federal agency shall be 
supplemented with an appendix listing the types of federal financial 
assistance, i.e., the statutes authorizing such assistance, to which the 
regulation applies. Each such appendix shall be kept up-to-date by 
amendments published, at appropriate intervals, in the Federal Register. 
In issuing or amending such an appendix, the agency need not follow the 
procedure set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.

[Order No. 670-76, 41 FR 52669, Dec. 1, 1976, as amended by Order No. 
960-81, 46 FR 52357, Oct. 27, 1981]


<R05>
Sec. 42.404  Guidelines.

    (a) Federal agencies shall publish title VI guidelines for each type 
of program to which they extend financial assistance, where such 
guidelines would be appropriate to provide detailed information on the 
requirements of title VI. Such guidelines shall be published within 
three months of the effective date of this subpart or of the effective 
date of any subsequent statute authorizing federal financial assistance 
to a new type of program. The guidelines shall describe the nature of 
title VI coverage, methods of enforcement, examples of prohibited 
practices in the context of the particular type of program, required or 
suggested remedial action, and the nature of requirements relating to 
covered employment, data collection, complaints and public information.
    (b) Where a federal agency determines that title VI guidelines are 
not appropriate for any type of program to which it provides financial 
assistance, the reasons for the determination shall be stated in writing 
and made available to the public upon request.


<R05>
Sec. 42.405  Public dissemination of title VI information.

    (a) Federal agencies shall make available and, where appropriate, 
distribute their title VI regulations and guidelines for use by federal 
employees, applicants for federal assistance, recipients, beneficiaries 
and other interested persons.
    (b) State agency compliance programs (see Sec. 42.410) shall be 
made available to the public.
    (c) Federal agencies shall require recipients, where feasible, to 
display prominently in reasonable numbers and places posters which state 
that the recipients operate programs subject to the nondiscrimination 
requirements of title VI, summarize those requirements, note the 
availability of title VI information from recipients and the federal 
agencies, and explain briefly the procedures for filing complaints. 
Federal agencies and recipients shall also include information on title 
VI requirements, complaint procedures and the rights of beneficiaries in 
handbooks, manuals, pamphlets and other

[[Page 824]]

material which are ordinarily distributed to the public to describe the 
federally assisted programs and the requirements for participation by 
recipients and beneficiaries. To the extent that recipients are required 
by law or regulation to publish or broadcast program information in the 
news media, federal agencies and recipients shall insure that such 
publications and broadcasts state that the program in question is an 
equal opportunity program or otherwise indicate that discrimination in 
the program is prohibited by federal law.
    (d)(1) Where a significant number or proportion of the population 
eligible to be served or likely to be directly affected by a federally 
assisted program (e.g., affected by relocation) needs service or 
information in a language other than English in order effectively to be 
informed of or to participate in the program, the recipient shall take 
reasonable steps, considering the scope of the program and the size and 
concentration of such population, to provide information in appropriate 
languages to such persons. This requirement applies with regard to 
written material of the type which is ordinarily distributed to the 
public.
    (2) Federal agencies shall also take reasonable steps to provide, in 
languages other than English, information regarding programs subject to 
title VI.


<R05>
Sec. 42.406  Data and information collection.

    (a) Except as determined to be inappropriate in accordance with 
paragraph (f) of this section or Sec. 42.404(b), federal agencies, as a 
part of the guidelines required by Sec. 42.404, shall in regard to each 
assisted program provide for the collection of data and information from 
applicants for and recipients of federal assistance sufficient to permit 
effective enforcement of title VI.
    (b) Pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, in conjunction with 
new applications for federal assistance (see 28 CFR 50.3(c) II A) and in 
any applications for approval of specific projects or significant 
changes in applications for continuation or renewal of assistance (see 
28 CFR 50.3(c) II B), and at other times as appropriate, federal 
agencies shall require applicants and recipients to provide relevant and 
current title VI information. Examples of data and information which, to 
the extent necessary and appropriate for determining compliance with 
title VI, should be required by agency guidelines are as follows:
    (1) The manner in which services are or will be provided by the 
program in question, and related data necessary for determining whether 
any persons are or will be denied such services on the basis of 
prohibited discrimination;
    (2) The population eligible to be served by race, color and national 
origin;
    (3) Data regarding covered employment, including use or planned use 
of bilingual public-contact employees serving beneficiaries of the 
program where necessary to permit effective participation by 
beneficiaries unable to speak or understand English;
    (4) The location of existing or proposed facilities connected with 
the program, and related information adequate for determining whether 
the location has or will have the effect of unnecessarily denying access 
to any persons on the basis of prohibited discrimination;
    (5) The present or proposed membership, by race, color and national 
origin, in any planning or advisory body which is an integral part of 
the program;
    (6) Where relocation is involved, the requirements and steps used or 
proposed to guard against unnecessary impact on persons on the basis of 
race, color or national origin.
    (c) Where additional data, such as demographic maps, the racial 
composition of affected neighborhoods or census data, is necessary or 
appropriate, for understanding information required in paragraph (b) of 
this section, federal agencies shall specify, in their guidelines or in 
other directives, the need to submit such data. Such additional data 
should be required, however, only to the extent that it is readily 
available or can be compiled with reasonable effort.
    (d) Pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, in all 
cases, federal agencies shall require:
    (1) That each applicant or recipient promptly notify the agency upon 
its request of any lawsuit filed against the

[[Page 825]]

applicant or recipient alleging discrimination on the basis of race, 
color or national origin, and that each recipient notify the agency upon 
its request of any complaints filed against the recipient alleging such 
discrimination;
    (2) A brief description of any applicant's or recipient's pending 
applications to other federal agencies for assistance, and of federal 
asssistance being provided at the time of the application or requested 
report;
    (3) A statement by any applicant describing any civil rights 
compliance reviews regarding the applicant conducted during the two-year 
period before the application, and information concerning the agency or 
organization performing the review; and periodic statements by any 
recipient regarding such reviews;
    (4) A written assurance by any applicant or recipient that it will 
compile and maintain records required, pursuant to paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of this section, by the agency's guidelines or other directives.
    (e) Federal agencies should inquire whether any agency listed by the 
applicant or recipient pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section has 
found the applicant or recipient to be in noncompliance with any 
relevant civil rights requirement.
    (f) Where a federal agency determines that any of the requirements 
of this section are inapplicable or inappropriate in regard to any 
program, the basis for this conclusion shall be set forth in writing and 
made available to the public upon request.


<R05>
Sec. 42.407  Procedures to determine compliance.

    (a) Agency staff determination responsibility. All federal agency 
staff determinations of title VI compliance shall be made by, or be 
subject to the review of, the agency's civil rights office. Where 
federal agency responsibility for approving applications or specific 
projects has been assigned to regional or area offices, the agency shall 
include personnel having title VI review responsibility on the staffs of 
such offices and such personnel shall perform the functions described in 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) Application review. Prior to approval of federal financial 
assistance, the federal agency shall make written determination as to 
whether the applicant is in compliance with title VI (see 28 CFR 50.3(c) 
II A). The basis for such a determination under ``the agency's own 
investigation'' provision (see 28 CFR 50.3(c) II A(2)), shall be 
submission of an assurance of compliance and a review of the data 
submitted by the applicant. Where a determination cannot be made from 
this data, the agency shall require the submission of necessary 
additional information and shall take other steps necessary for making 
the determination. Such other steps may include, for example, 
communicating with local government officials or minority group 
organizations and field reviews. Where the requested assistance is for 
construction, a pre-approval review should determine whether the 
location and design of the project will provide service on a 
nondiscriminatory basis and whether persons will be displaced or 
relocated on a nondiscriminatory basis.
    (c) Post-approval review. (1) Federal agencies shall establish and 
maintain an effective program of post-approval compliance reviews 
regarding approved new applications (see 28 CFR 50.3(c) II A), 
applications for continuation or renewal of assistance (28 CFR 50.3(c) 
II B) and all other federally assisted programs. Such reviews are to 
include periodic submission of compliance reports by recipients to the 
agencies and, where appropriate, field reviews of a representative 
number of major recipients. In carrying out this program, agency 
personnel shall follow agency manuals which establish appropriate review 
procedures and standards of evaluation. Additionally, agencies should 
consider incorporating a title VI component into general program reviews 
and audits.
    (2) The results of post-approval reviews shall be committed to 
writing and shall include specific findings of fact and recommendations. 
A determination of the compliance status of the recipient reviewed shall 
be made as promptly as possible.
    (d) Notice to assistant attorney general. Federal agencies shall 
promptly notify

[[Page 826]]

the Assistant Attorney General of instances of probable noncompliance 
determined as the result of application reviews or post-approval 
compliance reviews.


<R05>
Sec. 42.408  Complaint procedures.

    (a) Federal agencies shall establish and publish in their guidelines 
procedures for the prompt processing and disposition of complaints. The 
complaint procedures shall provide for notification in writing to the 
complainant and the applicant or recipient as to the disposition of the 
complaint. Federal agencies should investigate complaints having 
apparent merit. Where such complaints are not investigated, good cause 
must exist and must be stated in the notification of disposition. In 
such cases, the agency shall ascertain the feasibility of referring the 
complaint to the primary recipient, such as a State agency, for 
investigation.
    (b) Where a federal agency lacks jurisdiction over a complaint, the 
agency shall, wherever possible, refer the complaint to another federal 
agency or advise the complainant.
    (c) Where a federal agency requires or permits recipient to process 
title VI complaints, the agency shall ascertain whether the recipients' 
procedures for processing complaints are adequate. The federal agency 
shall obtain a written report of each such complaint and investigation 
and shall retain a review responsibility over the investigation and 
disposition of each complaint.
    (d) Each federal agency shall maintain a log of title VI complaints 
filed with it, and with its recipients, identifying each complainant by 
race, color, or national origin; the recipient; the nature of the 
complaint; the dates the complaint was filed and the investigation 
completed; the disposition; the date of disposition; and other pertinent 
information. Each recipient processing title VI complaints shall be 
required to maintain a similar log. Federal agencies shall report to the 
Assistant Attorney General on January 1, 1977, and each six months 
thereafter, the receipt, nature and disposition of all such title VI 
complaints.


<R05>
Sec. 42.409  Employment practices.

    Enforcement of title VI compliance with respect to covered 
employment practices shall not be superseded by state and local merit 
systems relating to the employment practices of the same recipient.


<R05>
Sec. 42.410  Continuing State programs.

    Each state agency administering a continuing program which receives 
federal financial assistance shall be required to establish a title VI 
compliance program for itself and other recipients which obtain federal 
assistance through it. The federal agencies shall require that such 
state compliance programs provide for the assignment of title VI 
responsibilities to designated state personnel and comply with the 
minimum standards established in this subpart for federal agencies, 
including the maintenance of records necessary to permit federal 
officials to determine the title VI compliance of the state agencies and 
the sub-recipient.


<R05>
Sec. 42.411  Methods of resolving noncompliance.

    (a) Effective enforcement of title VI requires that agencies take 
prompt action to achieve voluntary compliance in all instances in which 
noncompliance is found. Where such efforts have not been successful 
within a reasonable period of time, the agency shall initiate 
appropriate enforcement procedures as set forth in the 1965 Attorney 
General Guidelines, 28 CFR 50.3. Each agency shall establish internal 
controls to avoid unnecessary delay in resolving noncompliance, and 
shall promptly notify the Assistant Attorney General of any case in 
which negotiations have continued for more than sixty days after the 
making of the determination of probable noncompliance and shall state 
the reasons for the length of the negotiations.
    (b) Agreement on the part of a noncomplying recipient to take 
remedial steps to achieve compliance with title VI shall be set forth in 
writing by the recipient and the federal agency. The remedial plan shall 
specify the action necessary for the correction of title VI deficiencies 
and shall be available to the public.

[[Page 827]]


<R05>
Sec. 42.412  Coordination.

    (a) The Attorney General's authority under Executive Order 12250 is 
hereby delegated to the Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights 
Division.
    (b) Consistent with this subpart and the 1965 Attorney General 
Guidelines, 28 CFR 50.3, the Assistant Attorney General may issue such 
directives and take such other action as he deems necessary to insure 
that federal agencies carry out their responsibilities under title VI. 
In addition, the Assistant Attorney General will routinely provide to 
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget copies of all inter-
agency survey reports and related materials prepared by the Civil Rights 
Division that evaluate the effectiveness of an agency's title VI 
compliance efforts. Where cases or matters are referred to the Assistant 
Attorney General for investigation, litigation or other appropriate 
action, the federal agencies shall, upon request, provide appropriate 
resources to the Assistant Attorney General to assist in carrying out 
such action.

27, 1981]


<R05>
Sec. 42.413  Interagency cooperation and delegations.

    (a) Where each of a substantial number of recipients is receiving 
assistance for similar or related purposes from two or more federal 
agencies, or where two or more federal agencies cooperate in 
administering assistance for a given class of recipients, the federal 
agencies shall:
    (1) Jointly coordinate compliance with title VI in the assisted 
programs, to the extent consistent with the federal statutes under which 
the assistance is provided; and
    (2) Designate one of the federal agencies as the lead agency for 
title VI compliance purposes. This shall be done by a written delegation 
agreement, a copy of which shall be provided to the Assistant Attorney 
General and shall be published in the Federal Register.
    (b) Where such designations or delegations of functions have been 
made, the agencies shall adopt adequate written procedures to assure 
that the same standards of compliance with title VI are utilized at the 
operational levels by each of the agencies. This may include 
notification to agency personnel in handbooks, or instructions on any 
forms used regarding the compliance procedures.
    (c) Any agency conducting a compliance review or investigating a 
complaint of an alleged title VI violation shall notify any other 
affected agency upon discovery of its jurisdiction and shall 
subsequently inform it of the findings made. Such reviews or 
investigations may be made on a joint basis.
    (d) Where a compliance review or complaint investigation under title 
VI reveals a possible violation of Executive Order 11246, title VII of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e), or any other federal 
law, the appropriate agency shall be notified.

Sec. 42.414  Federal agency staff.

    Sufficient personnel shall be assigned by a federal agency to its 
title VI compliance program to ensure effective enforcement of title VI.


<R05>
Sec. 42.415  Federal agency title VI enforcement plan.

    Each federal agency subject to title VI shall develop a written plan 
for enforcement which sets out its priorities and procedures. This plan 
shall be available to the public and shall address matters such as the 
method for selecting recipients for compliance reviews, the 
establishment of timetables and controls for such reviews, the procedure 
for handling complaints, the allocation of its staff to different 
compliance functions, the development of guidelines, the determination 
as to when guidelines are not appropriate, and the provision of civil 
rights training for its staff.

                           General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 42.501  Purpose.

    The purpose of this subpart is to implement section 504 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, which prohibits discrimination 
on the basis of handicap in any program or activity receiving Federal 
financial assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 42.502  Application.

    This subpart applies to each recipient of Federal financial 
assistance from the Department of Justice and to each program or 
activity receiving such assistance. The requirements of this subpart do 
not apply to the ultimate beneficiaries of Federal financial assistance 
in the program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 42.503  Discrimination prohibited.

    (a) General. No qualified handicapped person shall, solely on the 
basis of handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the 
benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any 
program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.
    (b) Discriminatory actions prohibited. (1) A recipient may not 
discriminate on the basis of handicap in the following ways directly or 
through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements under any program 
or activity receiving Federal financial assistance:
    (i) Deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity accorded 
others to participate in the program or activity receiving Federal 
financial assistance;
    (ii) Deny a qualified handicapped person an equal opportunity to 
achieve the same benefits that others achieve in the program or activity 
receiving Federal financial assistance;
    (iii) Provide different or separate assistance to handicapped 
persons or classes of handicapped persons than is provided to others 
unless such action is necessary to provide qualified handicapped persons 
or classes of handicapped persons with assistance as effective as that 
provided to others;
    (iv) Deny a qualified handicapped person an equal opportunity to 
participate in the program or activity by providing services to the 
program;
    (v) Deny a qualified handicapped person an opportunity to 
participate as a member of a planning or advisory body;
    (vi) Permit the participation in the program or activity of 
agencies, organizations or persons which discriminate against the 
handicapped beneficiaries in the recipient's program;
    (vii) Intimidate or retaliate against any individual, whether 
handicapped or not, for the purpose of interfering with any right 
secured by section 504 or this subpart.
    (2) A recipient may not deny a qualified handicapped person the 
opportunity to participate in any program or activity receiving Federal 
financial assistance on the ground that other specialized aid, benefits, 
or services for handicapped persons are available.
    (3) A recipient may not, directly or through contractual, licensing, 
or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration 
that either purposely or in effect discriminate on the basis of 
handicap, defeat or substantially impair accomplishment of the 
objectives of the recipient's program or activity with respect to 
handicapped persons, or perpetuate the discrimination of another 
recipient if both recipients are subject to common administrative 
control or are agencies of the same State.
    (4) A recipient may not, in determining the location or design of a 
facility, make selections that either purposely or in effect 
discriminate on the basis of handicap or defeat or substantially impair 
the accomplishment of the objectives of the program or activity with 
respect to handicapped persons.
    (5) A recipient is prohibited from discriminating on the basis of 
handicap in aid, benefits, or services operating without Federal 
financial assistance where such action would discriminate against the 
handicapped beneficiaries or participants in any program or activity of 
the recipient receiving Federal financial assistance.
    (6) Any entity not otherwise receiving Federal financial assistance 
but using a facility provided with the aid of

[[Page 829]]

Federal financial assistance after the effective date of this subpart is 
prohibited from discriminating on the basis of handicap.
    (c) The exclusion of nonhandicapped persons or specified classes of 
handicapped persons from aid, benefits, or services limited by Federal 
statute or executive order to handicapped persons or a different class 
of handicapped persons is not prohibited by this subpart.
    (d) Recipients shall administer programs or activities in the most 
integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified handicapped 
persons.
    (e) Recipients shall insure that communications with their 
applicants, employees and beneficiaries are effectively conveyed to 
those having impaired vision and hearing.
    (f) A recipient that employs fifteen or more persons shall provide 
appropriate auxiliary aids to qualified handicapped persons with 
impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills where a refusal to make 
such provision would discriminatorily impair or exclude the 
participation of such persons in a program or activity receiving Federal 
financial assistance. Such auxiliary aids may include brailled and taped 
material, qualified interpreters, readers, and telephonic devices. 
Attendants, individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or 
study, or other devices or services of a personal nature are not 
required under this section. Departmental officials may require 
recipients employing fewer than fifteen persons to provide auxiliary 
aids when this would not significantly impair the ability of the 
recipient to provide its benefits or services.
    (g) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination 
in this subpart is not exhaustive but only illustrative.


<R05>
Sec. 42.504  Assurances required.

    (a) Assurances. Every application for Federal financial assistance 
covered by this subpart shall contain an assurance that the program or 
activity will be conducted in compliance with the requirements of 
section 504 and this subpart. Each agency within the Department that 
provides Federal financial assistance shall specify the form of the 
foregoing assurance and shall require applicants for Department 
financial assistance to obtain like assurances from subgrantees, 
contractors and subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and 
others connected with the program or activity. Each Department agency 
shall specify the extent to which an applicant will be required to 
confirm that the assurances provided by secondary recipients are being 
honored. Each assurance shall include provisions giving notice that the 
United States has a right to seek judicial enforcement of section 504 
and the assurance.
    (b) Assurances from government agencies. Assurances from agencies of 
State and local governments shall extend to any other agency of the same 
governmental unit if the policies of the other agency will affect the 
program or activity for which Federal financial assistance is requested.
    (c) Assurances from institutions. The assurances required with 
respect to any institution or facility shall be applicable to the entire 
institution or facility.
    (d) Duration of obligation. Where the Federal financial assistance 
is to provide or is in the form of real or personal property, the 
assurance will obligate the recipient and any transferee for the period 
during which the property is being used for the purpose for which the 
Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose 
involving the provisions of similar benefits, or for as long as the 
recipient retains ownership or possession of the property, whichever is 
longer. In all other cases the assurance will obligate the recipient for 
the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended.
    (e) Covenants. With respect to any transfer of real property, the 
transfer document shall contain a covenant running with the land 
assuring nondiscrimination on the condition described in paragraph (d) 
of this section. Where the property is obtained from the Federal 
Government, the covenant may also include a condition coupled with a 
right to be reserved by the Department to revert title to the property 
in the event of a breach of the covenant.

[[Page 830]]

    (f) Remedies. The failure to secure either an assurance or a 
sufficient assurance from a recipient shall not impair the right of the 
Department to enforce the requirements of section 504 and this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 42.505  Administrative requirements for recipients.

    (a) Remedial action. If the Department finds that a recipient has 
discriminated against persons on the basis of handicap in violation of 
section 504 or this subpart, the recipient shall take the remedial 
action the Department considers necessary to overcome the effects of the 
discrimination. This may include remedial action with respect to 
handicapped persons who are no longer participants in the recipient's 
program or activity but who were participants in the program when such 
discrimination occurred, and with respect to handicapped persons who 
would have been participants in the program had the discrimination not 
occurred.
    (b) Voluntary action. A recipient may take steps, in addition to the 
requirements of this subpart, to increase the participation of qualified 
handicapped persons in the recipient's program or activity.
    (c) Self-evaluation. (1) A recipient shall, within one year of the 
effective date of this subpart, evaluate and modify its policies and 
practices that do not meet the requirements of this subpart. During this 
process the recipient shall seek the advice and assistance of interested 
persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing 
handicapped persons. During this period and thereafter the recipient 
shall take any necessary remedial steps to eliminate the effects of 
discrimination that resulted from adherence to these policies and 
practices.
    (2) A recipient employing fifty or more persons and receiving 
Federal financial assistance from the Department of $25,000 or more 
shall, for at least three years following completion of the evaluation 
required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, maintain on file, make 
available for public inspection, and provide to the Department on 
request:
    (i) A list of the interested persons consulted,
    (ii) A description of areas examined and problems identified, and
    (iii) A description of modifications made and remedial steps taken.
    (d) Designation of responsible employee. A recipient employing fifty 
or more persons and receiving Federal financial assistance from the 
Department of $25,000 or more shall designate at least one person to 
coordinate compliance with this subpart.
    (e) Adoption of grievance procedures. A recipient employing fifty or 
more persons and receiving Federal financial assistance from the 
Department of $25,000 or more shall adopt grievance procedures that 
incorporate due process standards (e.g. adequate notice, fair hearing) 
and provide for the prompt and equitable resolution of complaints 
alleging any action prohibited by this subpart. Such procedures need not 
be established with respect to complaints from applicants for 
employment. An employee may file a complaint with the Department without 
having first used the recipient's grievance procedures.
    (f) Notice. (1) A recipient employing fifty or more persons and 
receiving Federal financial assistance from the Department of more than 
$25,000 shall, on a continuing basis, notify participants, 
beneficiaries, applicants, employees and unions or professional 
organizations holding collective bargaining or professional agreements 
with the recipient that it does not discriminate on the basis of 
handicap in violation of section 504 and this subpart. The notification 
shall state, where appropriate, that the recipient does not discriminate 
in its programs or activities with respect to access, treatment or 
employment. The notification shall also include identification of the 
person responsible for coordinating compliance with this subpart and 
where to file section 504 complaints with the Department and, where 
applicable, with the recipient. A recipient shall make the initial 
notification required by this paragraph within 90 days of the effective 
date of this subpart. Methods of initial and continuing notification may 
include the posting of notices, publication in newspapers and magazines, 
placement of notices in recipients' publication, and

[[Page 831]]

distribution of memoranda or other written communications.
    (2) Recruitment materials or publications containing general 
information that a recipient makes available to participants, 
beneficiaries, applicants, or employees shall include a policy statement 
of nondiscrimination on the basis of handicap.
    (g) The Department may require any recipient with fewer than fifty 
employees and receiving less than $25,000 in Federal financial 
assistance to comply with paragraphs (c)(2) and (d) through (f) of this 
section.
    (h) The obligation to comply with this subpart is not affected by 
any State or local law or requirement or limited employment 
opportunities for handicapped persons in any occupation or profession.

                               Employment


<R05>
Sec. 42.510  Discrimination prohibited.

    (a) General. (1) No qualified handicapped person shall on the basis 
of handicap be subjected to discrimination in employment under any 
program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.
    (2) A recipient shall make all decisions concerning employment under 
any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance in a 
manner which insures that discrimination on the basis of handicap does 
not occur and may not limit, segregate, or classify applicants or 
employees in any way that adversely affects their opportunities or 
status because of handicap.
    (3) A recipient may not participate in a contractual or other 
relationship that has the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped 
applicants or employees to discrimination prohibited by this section. 
The relationships referred to in this paragraph include relationships 
with employment and referral agencies, labor unions, organizations 
providing or administering fringe benefits to employees of the 
recipient, and organizations providing training and apprenticeships, and 
with civil service agencies in State or local units of government.
    (b) Specific activities. The prohibition against discrimination in 
employment applies to the following activities:
    (1) Recruitment, advertising, and application processing;
    (2) Hiring, upgrading, promotion, award of tenure, demotion, 
transfer, layoff, termination, right of return from layoff and rehiring;
    (3) Pay and any other form of compensation and changes in 
compensation, including fringe benefits available by virtue of 
employment, whether or not administered by the recipient;
    (4) Job assignments, job classifications, organizational structures, 
position descriptions, lines of progression, and seniority lists;
    (5) Leaves of absence, sick leave, or any other leave;
    (6) Selection and financial support for training, including 
apprenticeship, professional meetings, conferences, and selection for 
leaves of absence to pursue training;
    (7) Employer-sponsored activities, including those that are social 
or recreational; and
    (8) Any other term, condition, or privilege of employment.
    (c) In offering employment or promotions to handicapped individuals, 
recipients may not reduce the amount of compensation offered because of 
any disability income, pension or other benefit the applicant or 
employee receives from another source.
    (d) A recipient's obligation to comply with this section is not 
affected by any inconsistent term of any collective bargaining agreement 
to which it is a party.


<R05>
Sec. 42.511  Reasonable accommodation.

    (a) A recipient shall make reasonable accommodation to the known 
physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified handicapped 
applicant or employee unless the recipient can demonstrate, based on the 
individual assessment of the applicant or employee, that the 
accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its 
program or activity.
    (b) Reasonable accommodation may include making facilities used by 
employees readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons, job 
restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, acquisition or 
modification

[[Page 832]]

of equipment or devices (e.g., telecommunication or other telephone 
devices), the provisions of readers or qualified interpreters, and other 
similar actions.
    (c) Whether an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the 
operation of a recipient's program or activity depends upon a case-by-
case analysis weighing factors that include:
    (1) The overall size of the recipient's program or activity with 
respect to number of employees, number and type of facilities, and size 
of budget;
    (2) The type of the recipient's operation, including the composition 
and structure of the recipient's workforce; and
    (3) The nature and cost of the accommodation needed.

A reasonable accommodation may require a recipient to bear more than an 
insignificant economic cost in making allowance for the handicap of a 
qualified applicant or employee and to accept minor inconvenience which 
does not bear on the ability of the handicapped individual to perform 
the essential duties of the job.


<R05>
Sec. 42.512  Employment criteria.

    (a) A recipient may not use any employment test or other selection 
criterion that tends to screen out handicapped persons unless:
    (1) The test score or other selection criterion, as used by the 
recipient, is shown to be job-related for the position in question, and
    (2) Alternative job-related tests or criteria that tend to screen 
out fewer handicapped persons are not shown by the appropriate 
Department officials to be available.
    (b) A recipient shall administer tests using procedures (e.g., 
auxiliary aids such as readers for visually-impaired persons or 
qualified sign language interpreters for hearing-impaired persons) that 
accommodate the special problems of handicapped persons to the fullest 
extent, consistent with the objectives of the test. When a test is 
administered to an applicant or employee who has a handicap that impairs 
sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test results must accurately 
reflect the applicant's or employee's job skills, aptitude, or whatever 
other factor the test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the 
applicant's or employee's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills 
(except where those skills are the factors that the test purports to 
measure).


<R05>
Sec. 42.513  Preemployment inquiries.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a 
recipient may not conduct a preemployment medical examination and may 
not make preemployment inquiry of an applicant as to whether the 
applicant is a handicapped person or as to the nature or severity of a 
handicap. A recipient may, however, make preemployment inquiry into an 
applicant's ability to perform job-related functions.
    (b) When a recipient is taking remedial action to correct the 
effects of past discrimination pursuant to Sec. 42.505(a) of this 
subpart, when a recipient is taking voluntary action to overcome the 
effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in its 
Federally assisted program or activity pursuant to Sec. 42.505(b) of 
this subpart, or when a recipient is taking affirmative action pursuant 
to section 503 of the Act, the recipient may invite applicants for 
employment to indicate whether and to what extent they are handicapped: 
Provided, That:
    (1) The recipient states clearly on any written questionnaire used 
for this purpose or makes clear orally if no written questionnaire is 
used that the information requested is intended for use solely in 
connection with its remedial action obligations or its voluntary 
efforts;
    (2) The recipient states clearly that the information is being 
requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential as 
provided in paragraph (d) of this section, that refusal to provide it 
will not subject the applicant or employee to any adverse treatment, and 
that it will be used only in accordance with this part.
    (c) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a recipient from 
conditioning an offer of employment on the results of a medical 
examination conducted prior to the employee's entrance on duty: 
Provided, That:

[[Page 833]]

    (1) All entering employees are subjected to such an examination 
regardless of handicap, and
    (2) The results of such an examination are used only in accordance 
with the requirements of this subpart.
    (d) The applicant's medical record shall be collected and maintained 
on separate forms and kept confidential, except that the following 
persons may be informed:
    (1) Supervisors and managers regarding restrictions on the work of 
handicapped persons and necessary accommodations;
    (2) First aid and safety personnel if the condition might require 
emergency treatment; and
    (3) Government officials investigating compliance with the Act upon 
request for relevant information.

                              Accessibility


<R05>
Sec. 42.520  Discrimination prohibited.

    Recipients shall insure that no qualified handicapped person is 
denied the benefits of, excluded from participation in, or otherwise 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving 
Federal financial assistance because the recipient's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons.


<R05>
Sec. 42.521  Existing facilities.

    (a) Accessibility. A recipient shall operate each program or 
activity to which this subpart applies so that when each part is viewed 
in its entirety it is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped 
persons. This section does not require a recipient to make each of its 
existing facilities or every part of a facility accessible to and usable 
by handicapped persons.
    (b) Compliance procedures. A recipient may comply with the 
requirement of paragraph (a) of this section through acquisition or 
redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, 
assignment of aids to beneficiaries, delivery of services at alternate 
accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities, or any other method 
that results in making its program or activity accessible to handicapped 
persons. A recipient is not required to make structural changes in 
existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving 
compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. In choosing among methods 
for meeting the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a 
recipient shall give priority to those methods that serve handicapped 
persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (c) Small providers. If a recipient with fewer than fifteen 
employees finds, after consultation with a handicapped person seeking 
its services, that there is no method of complying with Sec. 42.521(a) 
other than making a significant alteration in its existing facilities, 
the recipient may, as an alternative, refer the handicapped person to 
other available providers of those services that are accessible.
    (d) Time period. A recipient shall comply with the requirement of 
paragraph (a) of this section within ninety days of the effective date 
of this subpart. However, where structural changes in facilities are 
necessary, such changes shall be made as expeditiously as possible and 
shall be completed no later than three years from the effective date of 
this subpart. If structural changes to facilities are necessary, a 
recipient shall, within six months of the effective date of this 
subpart, develop a written plan setting forth the steps that will be 
taken to complete the changes together with a schedule for making the 
changes. The plan shall be developed with the assistance of interested 
persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing 
handicapped persons and shall be made available for public inspection. 
The plan shall, at a minimum:
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the recipient's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its program or activity to handicapped 
persons;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
full accessibility under Sec. 42.521(a) and, if the time period of the 
transition plan is longer than one year, identify the steps that will be 
taken during each year of the transition period; and

[[Page 834]]

    (4) Indicate the person responsible for implementation of the plan.
    (e) Notice. The recipient shall adopt and implement procedures to 
insure that interested persons, including mentally retarded persons or 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, special learning problems, or 
other disabilities, can obtain information as to the existence and 
location of services, activities, and facilities that are accessible to 
and usable by handicapped persons.

<R05>
Sec. 42.522  New construction.

    (a) Design and construction. Each new facility constructed by, on 
behalf of, or for the use of a recipient shall be designed and 
constructed in such a manner that the facility is readily accessible to 
and usable by handicapped persons, if the construction was commenced 
after the effective date of this subpart. Any alterations to existing 
facilities shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be made in an 
accessible manner. Any alterations to existing facilities shall, to the 
maximum extent feasible, be made in an accessible manner.
    (b) Conformance with Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards. (1) 
Effective as of March 7, 1988, design, construction, or alteration of 
buildings in conformance with sections 3-8 of the Uniform Federal 
Accessibility Standards (UFAS) (appendix A to 41 CFR subpart 101-19.6) 
shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of this section with 
respect to those buildings. Departures from particular technical and 
scoping requirements of UFAS by the use of other methods are permitted 
where substantially equivalent or greater access to and usability of the 
building is provided.
    (2) For purposes of this section, section 4.1.6(1)(g) of UFAS shall 
be interpreted to exempt from the requirements of UFAS only mechanical 
rooms and other spaces that, because of their intended use, will not 
require accessibility to the public or beneficiaries or result in the 
employment or residence therein of persons with physical handicaps.
    (3) This section does not require recipients to make building 
alterations that have little likelihood of being accomplished without 
removing or altering a load-bearing structural member.

Sec. 42.601  Purpose and application.

    The purpose of this regulation is implement procedures for 
processing and resolving complaints of employment discrimination filed 
against recipients of Federal financial assistance subject to title VI 
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, title IX of the Education Amendments of 
1972, the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972, as amended, and 
provisions similar to title VI and title IX in Federal grant statutes. 
Enforcement of such provisions in Federal grant statutes is covered by 
this regulation to the extent they relate to prohibiting employment 
discrimination on the ground of race, color, national origin, religion 
or sex in programs receiving Federal financial assistance of the type 
subject to title VI or title IX. This regulation does not, however, 
apply to the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, as 
amended, the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, as 
amended, the Comprehensive Employment Training Act of 1973, as amended, 
or Executive Order 11246.


<R05>
Sec. 42.602  Exchange of information.

    EEOC and agencies shall share any information relating to the 
employment policies and practices of recipients of federal financial 
assistance that may assist each office in carrying out its 
responsibilities. Such information shall include, but not necessarily be 
limited to, affirmative action programs, annual employment reports, 
complaints, investigative files, conciliation or compliance agreements, 
and compliance review reports and files.


<R05>
Sec. 42.603  Confidentiality.

    When an agency receives information obtained by EEOC, the agency 
shall observe the confidentiality requirements

[[Page 838]]

of sections 706(b) and 709(e) of title VII as would EEOC, except in 
cases where the agency receives the same information from a source 
independent of EEOC or has referred a joint complaint to EEOC under this 
regulation. In such cases, the agency may use independent source 
information or information obtained by EEOC under the agency's 
investigative authority in a subsequent title VI, title IX or revenue 
sharing act enforcement proceeding. Agency questions concerning 
confidentiality shall be directed to the Associate Legal Counsel for 
Legal Services, Office of Legal Counsel of EEOC.


<R05>
Sec. 42.604  Standards for investigation, reviews and hearings.

    In any investigation, compliance review, hearing or other 
proceeding, agencies shall consider title VII case law and EEOC 
Guidelines, 29 CFR parts 1604 through 1607, unless inapplicable, in 
determining whether a recipient of Federal financial assistance has 
engaged in an unlawful employment practice.


<R05>
Sec. 42.605  Agency processing of complaints of employment discrimination.

    (a) Within ten days of receipt of a complaint of employment 
discrimination, an agency shall notify the respondent that it has 
received a complaint of employment discrimination, including the date, 
place and circumstances of the alleged unlawful employment practice.
    (b) Within thirty days of receipt of a complaint of employment 
discrimination an agency shall:
    (1) Determine whether it has jurisdiction over the complaint under 
title VI, title IX, or the revenue sharing act; and
    (2) Determine whether EEOC may have jurisdiction over the complaint 
under title VII of or the Equal Pay Act.
    (c) An agency shall transfer to EEOC a complaint of employment 
discrimination over which it does not have jurisdiction but over which 
EEOC may have jurisdiction within thirty days of receipt of a complaint. 
At the same time, the agency shall notify the complainant and the 
respondent of the transfer, the reason for the transfer, the location of 
the EEOC office to which the complaint was transferred and that the date 
the agency received the complaint will be deemed the date it was 
received by EEOC.
    (d) If any agency determines that a complaint of employment 
discrimination is a joint complaint, then the agency may refer the 
complaint to EEOC. The agency need not consult with EEOC prior to such a 
referral. An agency referral of a joint complaint should occur within 
thirty days of receipt of the complaint.
    (e) An agency shall refer to EEOC all joint complaints solely 
alleging employment discrimination against an individual. If an agency 
determines that special circumstances warrant its investigation of such 
a joint complaint, then the agency shall determine whether the 
complainant has filed a similar charge of employment discrimination with 
EEOC.
    (1) If an agency determines that the complainant has filed a similar 
charge of employment discrimination with EEOC, then the agency may 
investigate the complaint if EEOC agrees to defer its investigation 
pending the agency investigation.
    (2) If an agency determines that the complainant has not filed a 
similar charge of employment discrimination with the EEOC, then the 
agency may investigate the complaint if special circumstances warrant 
such action. In such cases, EEOC shall defer its investigation of the 
referred joint complaint pending the agency investigation.
    (f) An agency shall not refer to EEOC a joint complaint alleging a 
pattern or practice of employment discrimination unless special 
circumstances warrant agency referral of the complaint to EEOC.
    (g) If a joint complaint alleges discrimination in employment and in 
other practices of a recipient, an agency should, absent special 
circumstances, handle the entire complaint under the agency's own 
investigation procedures. In such cases, the agency shall determine 
whether the complainant has filed a similar charge of employment 
discrimination with EEOC. If such a charge has been filed, the agency 
and EEOC shall coordinate their activities. Upon agency request,

[[Page 839]]

EEOC should ordinarily defer its investigation pending the agency 
investigation.
    (h) When a joint complaint is referred to EEOC for investigation, 
the agency shall advise EEOC of the relevant civil rights provision(s) 
applicable to the employment practices of the recipient, whether the 
agency wants to receive advance notice of any conciliation negotiations, 
whether the agency wants EEOC to seek information concerning the 
relationship between the alleged discrimination and the recipient's 
Federally assisted programs or activities and, where appropriate, 
whether a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is to 
provide employment. The agency shall also notify the complainant and the 
recipient of the referral, the location of the EEOC office to which the 
complaint was referred, the identity of the civil rights provision(s) 
involved, the authority of EEOC under this regulation and that the date 
the agency received the complaint will be deemed the date it was 
received by EEOC. Specifically, the notice shall inform the recipient 
that the agency has delegated to EEOC its investigative authority under 
title VI, title IX, or the revenue sharing act, and the relevant act's 
implementing regulations. The agency, therefore, may use information 
obtained by EEOC under the agency's investigative authority in a 
subsequent title VI, title IX or revenue sharing act enforcement 
proceeding.

June 28, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 42.606  General rules concerning EEOC action on complaints.

    (a) A complaint of employment discrimination filed with an agency, 
which is transferred or referred to EEOC under this regulation, shall be 
deemed a charge received by EEOC. For all purposes under title VII and 
the Equal Pay Act, the date such a complaint was received by an agency 
shall be deemed the date it was received by EEOC.
    (b) When EEOC investigates a joint complaint it shall, where 
appropriate, seek sufficient information to allow the referring agency 
to determine whether the alleged employment discrimination is in a 
program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance and/or 
whether the alleged employment discrimination causes discrimination with 
respect to beneficiaries or potential beneficiaries of the assisted 
program.
    (c) Upon referral of a joint complaint alleging a pattern or 
practice of employment discrimination, EEOC generally will limit its 
investigation to the allegation(s) which directly affect the 
complainant.
    (d) If EEOC, in the course of an investigation of a joint complaint, 
is unable to obtain information from a recipient through voluntary 
means, EEOC shall consult with the referring agency to determine an 
appropriate course of action.
    (e) If EEOC agrees to defer its investigation of a complaint of 
employment discrimination pending an agency investigation of the 
complaint, then EEOC shall give due weight to the agency's determination 
concerning the complaint.


<R05>
Sec. 42.607  EEOC dismissals of complaints.

    If EEOC determines that the title VII allegations of a joint 
complaint should be dismissed, EEOC shall notify the complainant and the 
recipient of the reason for the dismissal and the effect the dismissal 
has on the complainant's rights under the relevant civil rights 
provision(s) of the referring agency, and issue a notice of right to sue 
under title VII. At the same time, EEOC shall transmit to the referring 
agency a copy of EEOC's file.


<R05>
Sec. 42.608  Agency action on complaints dismissed by EEOC.

    Upon EEOC's transmittal of a dismissal under Sec. 42.607 of this 
regulation, the referring agency shall determine within thirty days, 
what, if any, action the agency intends to take with respect to the 
complaint and then notify the complainant and the recipient. In reaching 
that determination, the referring agency shall give due weight to EEOC's 
determination that the title VII allegations of the joint complaint 
should be dismissed. If the referring agency decides to take action with 
respect to a complaint that EEOC has dismissed for lack of reasonable 
cause

[[Page 840]]

to believe that title VII has been violated, the agency shall notify the 
Assistant Attorney General and the Chairman of the EEOC in writing of 
the action it plans to take and the basis of its decision to take such 
action.


<R05>
Sec. 42.609  EEOC reasonable cause determination and conciliation efforts.

    (a) If EEOC, after investigation of a joint complaint, determines 
that reasonable cause exists to believe that title VII has been 
violated, EEOC shall advise the referring agency, the complainant and 
the recipient of that determination and attempt to resolve the complaint 
by informal methods of conference, conciliation and persuasion. If EEOC 
would like the referring agency to participate in conciliation 
negotiations, EEOC shall so notify the agency and the agency shall 
participate. EEOC shall provide advance notice of any conciliation 
negotiations to referring agencies that request such notice, whether or 
not EEOC requests their participation in the negotiations.
    (b) If EEOC's efforts to resolve the complaint by informal methods 
of conference, conciliation and persuasion fail, EEOC shall:
    (1) Issue a notice of failure of conciliation to the recipient in 
accordance with 29 CFR 1601.25;
    (2) Transmit to the referring agency a copy of EEOC's investigative 
file, including its Letter of Determination and notice of failure 
conciliation;
    (3) If the recipient is not a government, governmental entity or 
political subdivision, determine whether EEOC will bring suit under 
title VII and, in accordance with 29 CFR 1601.28, issue a notice of 
right to sue under title VII;
    (4) If the recipient is a government, governmental entity or 
political subdivision, refer the matter to the Attorney General in 
accordance with 29 CFR 1601.29. The Attorney General, or his or her 
delegate, will determine whether the Department of Justice will bring 
suit under title VII and, in accordance with 29 CFR 1601.28, issue a 
notice of right to sue under title VII.


<R05>
Sec. 42.610  Agency enforcement of unresolved complaints.

    (a) Upon EEOC's transmittal of a reasonable cause determination and 
notice of failure of conciliation under Sec. 42.609(b)(2) of this 
regulation, the referring agency shall determine, within thirty days, 
whether the recipient has violated any applicable civil rights 
provision(s) which the agency has a responsibility to enforce. The 
referring agency shall give due weight to EEOC's determination that 
reasonable cause exists to believe that title VII has been violated.
    (b) If the referring agency determines that the recipient has 
violated any applicable civil rights provision(s) which the agency has a 
responsibility to enforce, the agency shall so notify the complainant 
and the recipient and determine whether further efforts to obtain 
voluntary compliance are warranted. In reaching that determination, the 
agency shall give due weight to the failure of EEOC's efforts to resolve 
the complaint by informal methods. If the referring agency determines 
that further efforts to obtain voluntary compliance are not warranted or 
if such further efforts fail, the agency shall initiate appropriate 
enforcement proceedings under its own regulations.
    (c) If the referring agency determines that the recipient has not 
violated any applicable civil rights provision(s) which the agency has a 
responsibility to enforce, the agency shall notify the complainant, the 
recipient, the Assistant Attorney General and the Chairman of the EEOC 
in writing of the basis of that determination.


<R05>
Sec. 42.611  EEOC negotiated settlements and conciliation agreements.

    If the parties enter into a negotiated settlement (as described in 
29 CFR 1601.20) prior to a determination or a conciliation agreement (as 
described in 29 CFR 1601.24) after a determination, EEOC shall notify 
the referring agency that the complaint has been settled. The agency 
shall take no further action on the complaint of employment 
discrimination thereafter except that the agency may take the existence 
of the complaint into account in scheduling the recipient for a review 
under the agency's regulations.

[[Page 841]]


<R05>
Sec. 42.612  Interagency consultation.

    (a) Before investigating whether the employment practices of a 
recipient of Federal financial assistance constitute a pattern or 
practice of unlawful discrimination or initiating formal administrative 
enforcement procedures on that basis, an agency shall, to the extent 
practical, consult with the Chairman of the EEOC and the Assistant 
Attorney General to assure that duplication of effort will be minimized.
    (b) Prior to the initiation of any legal action against a recipient 
of Federal financial assistance alleging unlawful employment practices, 
the Department of Justice and/or EEOC shall, to the extent practical, 
notify the appropriate agency or agencies of the proposed action and the

<R05>
Sec. Sec. 42.703-42.709  [Reserved]

              Standards for Determining Age Discrimination


<R05>
Sec. 42.710  General prohibition.

    (a) Subject to the exceptions discussed in Sec. Sec. 42.711-42.713, 
no person in the United States shall, on the basis of age, be excluded 
from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to 
discrimination in any program or activity to which this subpart applies. 
This prohibition applies to actions taken by a recipient, directly or 
through contractual or other arrangements, that have the purpose or 
effect of discriminating on the basis of age.
    (b) This prohibition encompasses treatment of elderly persons, 
children and any other age group. Unless one of the exception applies, 
the recipient may use neither a minimum age limit nor a maximum age 
limit in connection with receipt of benefits or services or other 
participation in a program or activity subject to this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 42.711  Exception; authorized by law.

    (a) This subpart does not apply to an age distinction contained in a 
portion of a federal or state statute or a local statute or ordinance 
adopted by an elected, general-purpose legislative body which portion:
    (1) Provides any benefits or assistance to persons on the basis of 
age;
    (2) Establishes criteria for participation in age-related terms; or
    (3) Describes intended beneficiaries or target groups in age-related 
terms.
    (b) The exception set forth in paragraph (a) of this section does 
not extend to regulations adopted by an administrative agency pursuant 
to a specific statutory provision or otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 42.712  Exception; normal operation or statutory objective.

    (a) A recipient may take an action that would otherwise be 
prohibited by Sec. 42.710(a), if such action reasonably takes age into 
account as a factor necessary to the normal operation of or the 
achievement of any statutory objective of the program or activity.
    (1) Normal operation refers to the operation of a program or 
activity without significant changes that would impair its ability to 
meet its objectives.
    (2) A statutory objective of a program or activity is a purpose that 
is expressly stated in a federal or state statute or a local statute or 
ordinance adopted by an elected, general-purpose body.
    (b) This exception applies when the following test is met--
    (1) Age is used as a measure or approximation of one or more other 
characteristics;
    (2) The other characteristic must be measured or approximated in 
order to continue the normal operation of the program or activity or to 
achieve any statutory objective of the program;
    (3) The other characteristic can be reasonably measured or 
approximated by the use of age; and
    (4) The other characteristic is impractical to measure directly on 
an individual basis.

[[Page 844]]

    (c) The question whether an age distinction comes within this 
section depends upon the particular facts, including the nature and 
purpose of the program or activity, the basis for and the nature and 
purpose of the age distinction, and the manner in which the age 
distinction is used.


<R05>
Sec. 42.713  Exception; reasonable factors other than age.

    (a) A recipient may take an action, otherwise prohibited by Sec. 
42.710(a), that affects age groups differently, if such differentiation 
is based upon reasonable factors other than age.
    (b) This exception does not apply to the use of an explicit age 
distinction, but to conduct that has the effect of differentiating among 
age groups. This exception applies when the factor (other than age) upon 
which the recipient's action is based bears a direct and substantial 
relationship to the normal operation of or achievement of a statutory 
objective of the program or activity.


<R05>
Sec. 42.714  Special benefits.

    If a recipient operating a program or activity provides special 
benefits to the elderly or to children, such use of age distinctions 
shall be presumed to be necessary to the normal operation of the program 
or activity, notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 42.712.


<R05>
Sec. 42.715  Burden of proof regarding exceptions.

    The burden of proving that an age distinction or other action falls 
within the exceptions described in Sec. 42.712 and Sec. 42.713 is on 
the recipient. This allocation of the burden of proof applies in 
proceedings by the Department to enforce the Act.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 42.722  Recipient assessment of age distinctions.

    (a) As part of a compliance review under Sec. 42.730 or complaint 
investigation under Sec. 42.731, the Department may require a recipient 
employing the equivalent of 15 or more employees to complete a written 
self-evaluation, in a manner specified by the responsible Department 
official, of any age distinction imposed in its program or activity 
receiving federal financial assistance from the Department to assess the 
recipient's compliance with the Act.
    (b) Whenever a recipient assessment indicates a violation of the Act 
and this subpart, the recipient shall take corrective action.


<R05>
Sec. 42.723  Compliance information.

    (a) Upon request by the Department, a recipient shall make available 
to the Department information necessary to determine whether the 
recipient is complying with this subpart.
    (b) Each recipient shall permit reasonable access by the Department 
to the recipient's facilities, books, records and other sources of 
information concerning the recipient's compliance with this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 42.724  Remedial and affirmative action.

    (a) If the Department finds that, in violation of this subpart, a 
recipient has discriminated on the basis of age, the recipient shall 
take remedial action that the Department considers necessary to overcome 
the effects of the discrimination.
    (b) Even in the absence of a finding of discrimination, a recipient, 
in administering a program or activity, may take steps to overcome the 
effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation on the 
basis of age.

[[Page 845]]


<R05>
Sec. 42.725  Assurance of compliance.

    Each recipient of federal financial assistance from the Department 
shall sign a written assurance as specified by the Department that it

<R05>
Sec. Sec. 42.726-42.729  [Reserved]

                          Compliance Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 42.730  Compliance reviews.

    The Department may conduct a pre-award or post-award compliance 
review of an applicant or a recipient to determine compliance with this 
subpart. When a compliance review indicates probably noncompliance, the 
Department shall inform the applicant or recipient and shall promptly 
begin enforcement as described in Sec. 42.733.


<R05>
Sec. 42.731  Complaints.

    (a) General. This section provides for the filing, by aggrieved 
persons, of complaints alleging violation of this subpart. Although the 
complaint process is limited to aggrieved persons, any person who has 
information regarding a possible violation of this subpart may provide 
it to the Department.
    (b) Receipt of complaints. (1) Any aggrieved person, individually or 
as a member of a class, may file with the Department a written complaint 
alleging a violation of this subpart. A complaint may be filed by a 
representative of an aggrieved person. A complaint must be filed within 
180 days of the date the complaint first knew of the alleged violation. 
However, this time limit may, for good cause shown, be extended by the 
Department.
    (2) The Department shall promptly review each such complaint for 
sufficiency. A complaint will be deemed sufficient if it--
    (i) Describes an action that may constitute a violation of this 
subpart; and
    (ii) Contains information necessary for further processing (i.e., 
identifies the parties involved, states the date when the complainant 
first learned of the alleged violation, and is signed by the 
complainant).
    (3) When a complaint is deemed sufficient, the Department shall 
promptly refer it to the FMCS for mediation.
    (4) When a complaint is deemed insufficient, the Department shall 
advise the complainant of the reasons for that determination. A 
complainant shall be freely permitted to add information necessary for 
further processing.
    (c) Representation of parties. During each stage of the complaint 
process, the complainant and the recipient may be represented by an 
attorney or other representative.
    (d) Assistance from the Department. Any complainant or recipient may 
request from the Department information regarding the complaint process.
    (e) Mediation. (1) When a complaint is referred for mediation, the 
complainant and the recipient shall participate in the mediation process 
to the extent necessary either to reach an agreement or to enable the 
mediator to determine that no agreement can be reached. No determination 
that an agreement is not possible shall be made until the mediator has 
conferred at least once, jointly or separately, with each of the 
parties.
    (2) If the complainant and the recipient reach an agreement, they 
shall reduce the agreement to writing and sign it. The mediator shall 
send a copy of the agreement to the Department.
    (3) If, after 60 days after the Department's receipt of a complaint, 
no agreement is reached or if, within that 60-day period, the mediator 
determines that no agreement can be reached, the mediator shall return 
the complaint to the Department.
    (4) The mediator shall protect the confidentiality of information 
obtained during the mediation process. No mediator shall testify in any 
adjudicative proceeding, produce any document, or otherwise disclose any 
information obtained during the mediation process without prior approval 
of the Director of the FMCS.
    (f) Department investigations. The Department shall promptly 
investigate any complaint that is unresolved after mediation or is 
reopened because of violation of a mediation agreement. An investigation 
should include a review of the pertinent actions or practices of the 
recipient and the circumstances under which the alleged discrimination 
occurred. During an investigation the Department shall take appropriate

[[Page 846]]

steps to obtain informal resolution of the complaint.
    (g) Resolution of matters. (1) Where, prior to any finding by the 
Department of probable noncompliance with this subpart, discussions 
between the Department and the parties result in settlement of a 
complaint, the Department shall prepare an agreement to be signed by the 
parties and an authorized official of the Department. A settlement shall 
not affect the operation of any other enforcement efforts of the 
Department, including compliance reviews or investigation of other 
complaints involving the recipient.
    (2) If the Department determines that an investigation pursuant to 
paragraph (f) of this section indicates probable noncompliance with this 
subpart, the Department shall inform the recipient and shall promptly 
begin enforcement pursuant to Sec. 42.733.
    (3) If the Department determines that an investigation does not 
indicate probable noncompliance, the Department shall inform the 
recipient and the complainant. The Department shall also inform the 
complainant of his or her right to bring a civil action as described in 
Sec. 42.736.


<R05>
Sec. 42.732  Prohibition against intimidation.

    A recipient may not intimidate or retaliate against any person who 
attempts to assert a right secured by the Act and this suppart or who 
cooperates in any mediation, investigation, hearing, or other aspect of 
the Department's compliance procedure.


<R05>
Sec. 42.733  Enforcement procedures.

    (a) Voluntary compliance. When a compliance review or complaint 
investigation results in a finding of probable noncompliance with this 
subpart, the Department shall attempt to obtain voluntary compliance. An 
agreement for voluntary compliance shall describe the corrective action 
to be taken and time limits for such action and shall be signed by the 
recipient and an authorized official of the Department.
    (b) Means of enforcement--(1) General. (i) The Department may seek 
to enforce this subpart--
    (A) By administrative proceedings that may lead to termination or 
refusal of federal financial assistance to the particular program or 
activity; or
    (B) By any other means authorized by law. Such other means include 
lawsuits by the Department of enjoin violations of this subpart.
    (ii) To the extent consistent with the Act, the Department, in 
enforcing this subpart, shall follow the procedures applicable to 
enforcement of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
    (2) Termination of federal financial assistance. With regard to 
enforcement of this subpart through the termination or refusal of 
federal financial assistance, the Department shall follow the provisions 
of its title VI regulation concerning notice (28 CFR 42.180(c)), 
hearings (28 CFR 42.109), and decisions (28 CFR 42.110). However, with 
respect to programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance 
from a component of the Department's Office of Justice Programs (OJP), 
the requirement of 28 CFR 42.110(e) that a sanction be approved by the 
Attorney General shall not apply; that function may be performed by the 
Assistant Attorney General, OJP.
    (3) Other means of enforcement. With regard to enforcement of this 
subpart through other means, the Department shall follow the procedures 
of 28 CFR 42.108(d). In addition, at least 30 days before commencing a 
lawsuit or taking other action pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of 
this section, the Department shall send an appropriate report to the 
committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate having 
legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved.
    (c) Deferral. When a proceeding for the termination or refusal or 
federal financial assistance is initiated pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(1)(i)(A) of this section, the Department may defer granting new 
federal financial assistance to the recipient.
    (1) New federal financial assistance includes any assistance for 
which, during the deferral period, the Department requires an 
application or approval, including renewal or continuation of existing 
activities or authorization of new activities. New federal financial 
assistance does not include assistance approved prior to initiation of 
the administrative proceeding or increases in

[[Page 847]]

funding as a result of a change in the manner of computing formula 
awards.
    (2) A deferral may not begin until the recipient has received a 
notice of opportunity for a hearing. A deferral may not continue for 
more than 60 days unless a hearing has begun within that time or the 
time for beginning the hearing has been extended by mutual consent of 
the recipient and the Department. A deferral may not continue for more 
than 30 days after the close of the hearing, unless the hearing results 
in a finding against the recipient.


<R05>
Sec. 42.734  Alternative funding.

    When assistance to a recipient is terminated or refused pursuant to 
Sec. 42.733(b)(1)(i)(A), the Department may disburse the withheld funds 
directly to an alternate recipient serving the same area (i.e., a public 
or nonprofit private organization or agency or state or political 
subdivision of the state). Any such alternate recipient must demonstrate 
the ability to comply with the requirements of this subpart and to 
achieve the goals of the federal statute authorizing the assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 42.735  Judicial review.

    A final decision of the Department in an administrative proceeding 
pursuant to Sec. 42.733(b)(1)(i)(A) is subject to judicial review as 
provided in section 306 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 6105.


<R05>
Sec. 42.736  Private lawsuits.

    (a) Upon exhausting administrative remedies under the Act, a 
complainant may file a civil action to enjoin a violation of the Act. 
Administrative remedies are exhausted if--
    (1) 180 days have elapsed since the complainant filed the complaint 
and the Department has made no finding with regard to the complaint; or
    (2) The Department issues a finding, pursuant to Sec. 42.731(g)(3), 
in favor of the recipient.
    (b) Whenever administrative remedies are exhausted in accord with 
paragraph (a) of this section, the Department shall promptly inform the 
complainant that
    (1) The complainant may bring a civil action in a United States 
district court for the district in which the recipient is located or 
transacts business;
    (2) A complainant who prevails in such an action has the right to be 
awarded reasonable attorney's fees, if the complainant demands such an 
award in the complaint initiating the lawsuit;
    (3) Before commencing the action, the complainant must give 30 days' 
notice by registered mail to the Secretary, the Attorney General, and 
the recipient;
    (4) The notice must state the nature of the alleged violation, the 
relief requested, the court in which the action will be brought, and 
whether attorney's fees will be demanded; and
    (5) The complainant may not bring an action if the same alleged 
violation by the recipient is the subject of a pending action in any 
court of the United States.


<R05>
Sec. Sec. 42.737-42.799  [Reserved]

    Appendix A to Subpart I of Part 42--Federal Financial Assistance 
 Administered by the Department of Justice to Which This Subpart Applies

    Note: Failure to list a type of federal assistance in appendix A 
shall not mean, if the Age Discrimination Act is otherwise applicable, 
that a program or activity is not covered. For the text of appendix A to 
subpart I, see appendix A to subpart C of this part.

Appendix B to Subpart I of Part 42--Age Distinctions in Federal Statutes 
   or Regulations Affecting Financial Assistance Administered by the 
                          Department of Justice

    Section 90.31(f) of HHS' the general regulations (45 CFR part 90) 
requires each federal agency to publish an appendix to its final 
regulation containing a list of age distinctions in federal statutes and 
regulations affecting financial assistance administered by the agency. 
This appendix is the Department's list of federal statutes and 
Department regulations that contain age distinctions that:
    (1) Provide benefits or assistance to persons based upon age; or
    (2) Establish criteria for participation in age-related terms; or
    (3) Describe intended beneficiaries or target groups in age-related 
terms.
    The Department administers financial assistance under the Juvenile 
Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 
5601-5672). This statute reflects

[[Page 848]]

the basic distinction between criminal justice systems for adults and 
juvenile justice systems, and the entire statute is predicated upon 
making distinctions on the basis of age between juveniles and adults. 
Such age distinctions are set forth throughout this statute, including 
provisions establishing programs of financial assistance to juvenile 
justice systems and for purposes related to the prevention of juvenile 
delinquency. The Department's current regulations pertaining to formula 
grants under this statute are set forth at 28 CFR part 31 (CFDA No. 
16.540). In order to implement the statutory purposes, these regulations 
reflect the same age distinctions between juveniles and adults as are 
contained in the statute. The same statute also provides for 
discretionary special emphasis grants for which there are program 
announcements issued (CFDA No. 16.541), and this program also 
necessarily reflects the basic statutory distinction based on age.
    The Department is authorized to extend financial assistance under 
the Missing Children's Assistance Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5771-5777). 
This law is concerned with problems related to missing children, and, 
thus, it contains many age-related references to children, including 
references in connection with the provision of financial assistance. 
Program announcements are issued in connection with this program (CFDA 
No. 16.543).
    The Department is authorized to extend financial assistance pursuant 
to the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, as amended 
(42 U.S.C. 3701-3797). Among the statutory purposes of this law is the 
provision of grants addressing problems related to juvenile delinquency 
and problems related to crimes committed against elderly persons. 
Accordingly, this law also reflects the basic distinction between 
criminal justice systems for adults and juvenile justice systems. This 
law also singles out elderly persons as a special target group to 
benefit from its programs. The Department's regulations concerning block 
grants authorized under this statute are set forth at 28 CFR part 33. 
These regulations reflect the statutory authorizations for such block 
grants, which specifically authorize funds for, among other things, 
programs addressing problems related to juvenile delinquency and 
programs addressing the problem of crimes committed against elderly 
persons (CFDA No. 16.573). Similarly, the statute provides for 
discretionary grants to enhance and complement the block grants (CFDA 
No. 16.574) and has been amended to provide a focus on narcotics control 
(CFDA No. 16.580).
    The Department is authorized to extend financial assistance under 
the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, as amended (42 U.S.C. 10601-10604). 
Among other things, in order to qualify for funds under one grant 
program, a state must certify that priority will be given to eligible 
crime victim assistance programs that help victims of certain crimes, 
including child abuse. In addition, among the services to victims of 
crime for which funding is available is ``short term child care 
services'' (CFDA Nos. 16.575 and 16.576).
    The Department is authorized to make grants to Native American 
Indian tribes with funds reserved to the Office of Victims of Crime 
under the Victims of Crime act of 1984, as amended (42 U.S.C. 10601(g)). 
The primary purpose of the funding is to assist Native American Indian 
tribes with handling child abuse cases, particularly child sexual abuse 
(CFDA No. 16.583).
    The Department is authorized to extend financial assistance to state 
and local authorities for narcotics control under the Anti-Drug Abuse 
Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-690, 102 Stat. 4181), which extends and/or 
modifies each of the previously noted laws. The statute reflects the 
basic distinction between criminal justice systems for adults and 
juveniles (CFDA Nos. 16.579 and 16.582).
