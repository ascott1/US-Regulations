                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2001), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

                       Subpart A--Official Records

    Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301, 552; 7 U.S.C. 3125a; 31 U.S.C. 9701; and 7 
CFR 2.28(b)(7)(viii).


<R05>
Sec. 1.1  Purpose and scope.

    This subpart establishes policy, procedures, requirements, and 
responsibilities for administration and coordination of the Freedom of 
Information Act (``FOIA''), 5 U.S.C. 552, pursuant to which any person 
may obtain official records. It also provides rules pertaining to the 
disclosure of records pursuant to compulsory process. This subpart also 
serves as the implementing regulations (referred to in Sec. 1.3, 
``Agency implementing regulations'') for the Office of the Secretary 
(the immediate offices of the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Under 
Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries) and for the Office of 
Communications. The Office of Communications has the primary 
responsibility for implementation of the FOIA in the Department of 
Agriculture (``USDA'' or ``Department''). The term ``agency'' or 
``agencies'' is used throughout this subpart to include both USDA 
program agencies and staff offices.

[65 FR 46336, July 28, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 1.2  Policy.

    (a) Agencies of USDA shall comply with the time limits set forth in 
the FOIA and in this subpart for responding to and processing requests 
and appeals for agency records, unless there are unusual circumstances 
within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B) and Sec. 1.16(b). An agency 
shall notify a requester in writing whenever it is unable to respond to 
or process a request or appeal within the time limits established by the 
FOIA.
    (b) All agencies of the Department shall comply with the fee 
schedule provided as appendix A to this subpart, with regard to the 
charging of fees for providing copies of records and related services to 
requesters.

[65 FR 46337, July 28, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 1.3  Agency implementing regulations.

    Each agency of the Department shall promulgate regulations setting 
forth the following:
    (a) The location and hours of operation of the agency office or 
offices where members of the public may gain access to those materials 
required by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) and Sec. 1.4 to be made available for 
public inspection and copying.
    (b) Information regarding the publication and distribution (by sale 
or otherwise) of indexes and supplements to

[[Page 8]]

indexes that are maintained in accordance with the requirements of 5 
U.S.C. 552(a)(2) and Sec. 1.4(c);
    (c) The title and mailing address of the official or officials of 
the agency authorized to receive requests for records submitted in 
accordance with Sec. 1.5(a), and to make determinations regarding 
whether to grant or deny such requests. Authority to make such 
determinations includes authority to:
    (1) Extend the 20 working day administrative deadline for reply 
pursuant to Sec. 1.16;
    (2) Make discretionary releases pursuant to Sec. 1.19(b);
    (3) Make determinations regarding the charging of fees pursuant to 
appendix A to this subpart;
    (d) The title and mailing address of the agency official who is 
authorized to receive appeals submitted in accordance with Sec. 1.14 and 
to make determinations regarding whether to grant or deny such appeals. 
Authority to determine appeals includes authority to:
    (1) Extend the 20 working day administrative deadline for reply 
pursuant to Sec. 1.16 (to the extent the maximum extension authorized by 
Sec. 1.16(c) was not used with regard to the initial request;
    (2) Make discretionary releases pursuant to Sec. 1.19(b);
    (3) Make determinations regarding the charging of fees pursuant to 
appendix A to this subpart; and
    (e) Other information which would be of concern to a person wishing 
to request records from that agency in accordance with this subpart.

[65 FR 46337, July 28, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 1.4  Public access to certain materials.

    (a) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2), each agency within the 
Department shall make the following materials available for public 
inspection and copying (unless they are promptly published and copies 
offered for sale):
    (1) Final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as 
well as orders, made in the adjudication of cases;
    (2) Those statements of policy and interpretation which have been 
adopted by the agency and are not published in the Federal Register;
    (3) Administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that 
affect a member of the public;
    (4) Copies of all records, regardless of form or format, which have 
been released pursuant to a FOIA request under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3), and 
which because of the nature of their subject matter, have become or are 
likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially 
the same records. Agencies shall decide on a case by case basis whether 
records fall into this category, based on the following factors:
    (i) Previous experience with similar records;
    (ii) The particular characteristics of the records involved, 
including their nature and the type of information contained in them; 
and
    (iii) The identity and number of requesters and whether there is 
widespread media, historical, academic, or commercial interest in the 
records.
    (5) A general index of the records referred to in paragraph (a)(4) 
of this section.
    (b) Records encompassed within paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of 
this section created on or after November 1, 1996, shall be made 
available to the public by computer telecommunications or, if computer 
telecommunications means have not been established by the agency, by 
other electronic means.
    (c) Each agency of the Department shall maintain and make available 
for public inspection and copying current indexes providing identifying 
information regarding any matter issued, adopted or promulgated after 
July 4, 1967, and required by paragraph (a) of this section to be make 
available or published. Each agency shall publish and make available for 
distribution copies of such indexes and supplements to such indexes at 
least quarterly, unless it determines by notice published in the Federal 
Register that publication would be unnecessary and impracticable. After 
issuance of such notice, each agency shall provide copies of any index 
upon request at a cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication.
    (d) Each agency is responsible for preparing reference material or a 
guide for requesting records or information

[[Page 9]]

from that agency. This guide shall also include an index of all major 
information systems, and a description of major information and record 
locator systems.
    (e) Each agency shall also prepare a handbook for obtaining 
information from that agency. The handbook should be a short, simple 
explanation to the public of what the FOIA is designed to do, and how a 
member of the public can use it to access government records. The 
handbook should be available on paper and through electronic means, and 
it should identify how a requester can access agency Freedom of 
Information Act annual reports. Similarly, the annual reports should 
refer to the handbook and how to obtain it.
    (f) It is appropriate to make frequently requested records available 
in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section in situations where 
public access in a timely manner is important, and it is not intended to 
apply where there may be a limited number of requests over a short 
period of time from a few requesters. Agencies may remove a record from 
this access medium when the appropriate official determines that it is 
unlikely there will be substantial further requests for that document.

[65 FR 46337, July 28, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 1.5   Requests for records.

    (a) Any person who wishes to inspect or obtain copies of any record 
of any agency of the Department shall submit a request in writing and 
address the request to the official designated in regulations 
promulgated by that agency. The requester may ask for a fee waiver. All 
such requests for records shall be deemed to have been made pursuant to 
the Freedom of Information Act, regardless of whether the request 
specifically mentions the Freedom of Information Act. To facilitate 
processing of a request, the requester should place the phrase ``FOIA 
REQUEST'' in capital letters on the front of the envelope or on the 
cover sheet of the facsimile transmittal.
    (b) A request must reasonably describe the records to enable agency 
personnel to locate them with reasonable effort. Where possible, a 
requester should supply specific information regarding dates, titles, 
names of individuals, names of offices, and names of agencies or other 
organizations that may help identify the records. If the request relates 
to a matter in pending litigation, the requester should identify the 
court and its location.
    (c) If an agency determines that a request does not reasonably 
describe the records, the agency shall inform the requester of this fact 
and extend the requester an opportunity to clarify the request or to 
confer promptly with knowledgeable agency personnel to attempt to 
identify the records the requester is seeking. The ``date of receipt'' 
in such instances, for purposes of Sec. 1.13, shall be the date of 
receipt of the amended or clarified request.
    (d) If a request for records or a fee waiver made under this subpart 
is denied, the requester shall have the right to appeal the denial. 
Requesters also may appeal agency determinations of a requester's status 
for purposes of fee levels under sec. 5 of appendix A to this subpart. 
All appeals must be in writing and addressed to the official designated 
in regulations promulgated by the agency which denied the request. To 
facilitate processing of an appeal, the requester should place the 
phrase ``FOIA APPEAL'' in capital letters on the front of the envelope 
or on the cover sheet of the fax transmittal.
    (e) Requests that are not addressed to a specific agency in USDA, or 
which pertain to more than one USDA agency, or which are sent to the 
wrong agency of USDA, should be forwarded to the Department's FOIA 
Officer in the Office of Communications, U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
Washington, DC 20250.
    (f) The Department FOIA Officer will determine which agency or 
agencies should process the request, and, where necessary, refer the 
request to the appropriate agency or agencies. The Department FOIA 
Officer will also notify the requester of the referral and of the name 
of each agency to which the request has been referred.
    (g) A request will be properly received when it is in the possession 
of the component agency that has responsibility for maintaining the 
requested records.

[[Page 10]]

    (h) Each agency shall develop and maintain a record of all written 
requests and appeals received in that agency. The record shall include 
the names of the requester; a brief summary of the information 
requested; whether the request or appeal was granted, denied, or 
partially denied; the exemption from mandatory disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 
552(b) upon which any denial was based; and the amount of any fees 
associated with the request or appeal.

[65 FR 46337, July 28, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 1.6  Aggregating requests.

    When an agency reasonably believes that a requester, or a group of 
requesters acting in concert, is attempting to break a request down into 
a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, 
the agency may aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly. One 
element that may be considered in determining whether such a belief 
would be reasonable is the brevity of the time period during which the 
requests have been made.

[65 FR 46338, July 28, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 1.7  Agency response to requests for records.

    (a) 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(A)(i) provides that each agency of the 
Department to which a request for records is submitted in accordance 
with Sec. 1.5(a) shall inform the requester of its determination 
concerning that request within 20 working days of its date of receipt 
(excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays), plus any 
extension authorized under Sec. 1.16. If the agency determines to grant 
the request, it shall inform the requester of any conditions surrounding 
the granting of the request (e.g., payment of fees) and the approximate 
date upon which the agency will provide the requested records. If the 
agency grants only a portion of the request, it shall treat the portion 
not granted as a denial, and make a reasonable effort to estimate the 
volume of the records denied and provide this estimate to the requester, 
unless providing such an estimate would harm an interest protected by an 
exemption of the FOIA. If the agency determines to deny the request in 
part or in whole, it shall immediately inform the requester of that 
decision and provide the following:
    (1) The reasons for the denial;
    (2) The name and title or position of each person responsible for 
denial of the request;
    (3) The requester's right to appeal such denial and the title and 
address of the official to whom such appeal is to be addressed; and
    (4) The requirement that such appeal be made within 45 days of the 
date of the denial.
    (b) If the reason for not fulfilling a request is that the records 
requested are in the custody of another agency outside USDA, other than 
in the permanent custody of the National Archives and Records 
Administration (``NARA''), the agency shall inform the requester of this 
fact and shall forward the request to that agency or Department for 
processing in accordance with its regulations. If the records are in the 
permanent custody of NARA, the agency shall so inform the requester. 
Information about obtaining access to records at NARA may be obtained 
through the NARA Archival Information Locator (NAIL) Database at http://
www/nara.gov/nara.nail.html, or by calling NARA at (301) 713-6800. If 
the agency has no knowledge of requested records or if no records exist, 
the agency shall notify the requester of that fact.

[65 FR 46338, July 28, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 1.8  Multitrack processing.

    (a) When an agency has a significant number of requests, the nature 
of which precludes a determination within 20 working days, the requests 
may be processed in a multitrack processing system, based on the date of 
receipt, the amount of work and time involved in processing the request, 
and whether the request qualifies for expedited processing.
    (b) Agencies may establish as many processing tracks as appropriate; 
processing within each track shall be based on a first-in, first-out 
concept, and rank-ordered by the date of receipt of the request.
    (c) Agencies may provide a requester whose request does not qualify 
for the fastest track an opportunity to limit

[[Page 11]]

the scope of the request in order to qualify for a faster track. This 
multitrack processing system does not lessen agency responsibility to 
exercise due diligence in processing requests in the most expeditious 
manner possible.
    (d) Agencies shall process requests in each track on a ``first-in, 
first-out'' basis, unless there are unusual circumstances as set forth 
in Sec. 1.16, or the requester is entitled to expedited processing as 
set forth in Sec. 1.9.

[65 FR 46338, July 28, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 1.9  Expedited processing.

    (a) A requester may apply for expedited processing at the time of 
the initial request for records. Within ten calendar days of its receipt 
of a request for expedited processing, an agency shall decide whether to 
grant it, and shall notify the requester of the decision. Once the 
determination has been made to grant expedited processing, an agency 
shall process the request as soon as practicable. If a request for 
expedited processing is denied, the agency shall act expeditiously on 
any appeal of that decision.
    (b) A request or appeal will be taken out of order and given 
expedited treatment whenever the agency determines that the requester 
has established either of the following criteria:
    (1) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could 
reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or 
physical safety of an individual; or
    (2) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged 
federal government activity, if made by an individual primarily engaged 
in disseminating information. Representatives of the news media would 
normally qualify as individuals primarily engaged in disseminating 
information; however, other requesters must demonstrate that their 
primary activity involves publishing or otherwise disseminating 
information to the public as a whole, and not just a particular segment 
or group. ``Urgency'' contemplates that the information has a particular 
value that will be lost if not disseminated quickly. Ordinarily this 
means a breaking news story of general public interest. Information of 
historical interest only or information sought for litigation or 
commercial activities would not meet the test of urgency, nor would a 
news media publication or broadcast deadline unrelated to the news 
breaking nature of the information.
    (c) A requester who seeks expedited processing must provide a 
written statement that the requester has certified to be true and 
correct to the best of the requester's knowledge, explaining in detail 
the basis for requesting expedited processing. The agency will not 
consider the request to have been received unless accompanied by a 
written, certified statement, and will be under no obligation to 
consider the request for expedited processing until it receives such a 
written, certified statement.
    (d) the same procedures apply to requests for expedited processing 
of administrative appeals.

Sec. 1.10  Search services.

    Search services are services of agency personnel--clerical or 
professional--used in trying to find the records, that are responsive to 
a request. Search services includes both manual and electronic searches 
and time spent examining records for the purpose of finding information 
that is within the scope of the request. Search services also include 
services to transport personnel to places of record storage, or records 
to the location of personnel for the purpose of the search, if such 
services are reasonably necessary.

Sec. 1.11  Review services.

    (a) Review services are services of agency personnel--clerical or 
professional--in examining records, both paper and electronic, located 
in response to a request that is for a commercial use (as specified in 
sec. 6 of appendix A to this subpart) to determine whether any portion 
of any record located is exempt from mandatory disclosure.
    (b) Review services include processing any records for disclosure 
e.g., doing all that is necessary to redact exempt portions and 
otherwise prepare records for release.

[[Page 12]]

    (c) Review services do not include the time spent resolving general 
legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.

Sec. 1.12  Handling information from a private business.

    Each USDA agency is responsible for making the final determination 
with regard to the disclosure or nondisclosure of information in agency 
records that has been submitted by a business. When, in the course of 
responding to an FOIA request, an agency cannot readily determine 
whether the information obtained from a person is privileged or 
confidential business information, the policy of USDA is to obtain and 
consider the views of the submitter of the information and to provide 
the submitter an opportunity to object to any decision to disclose the 
information. If a request (including a subpoena duces tecum as described 
in Sec. 1.215) is received in USDA for information that has been 
submitted by a business, the agency shall:
    (a) Provide the business information submitter with prompt 
notification of a request for that information (unless it is readily 
determined by the agency that the information requested should not be 
disclosed or, on the other hand, that the information is not exempt by 
law from disclosure). Afford business information submitter reasonable 
time in which to object to the disclosure of any specified portion of 
the information. The submitter must explain fully all grounds upon which 
disclosure is opposed. For example, if the submitter maintains that 
disclosure is likely to cause substantial harm to it competitive 
position, the submitter must explain item-by-item why disclosure would 
cause such harm. Information provided by a business submitter pursuant 
to this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under FOIA;
    (b) Notify the requester of the need to inform the submitter of a 
request for submitted business information;
    (c) Determine whether the requested records are exempt from 
disclosure or must be released;
    (d) Provide business information submitters with notice of any 
determination to disclose such records prior to the disclosure date, in 
order that the matter may be considered for possible judicial 
intervention; and
    (e) Notify business information submitters promptly of all instances 
in which FOIA requesters bring suit seeking to compel disclosure of 
submitted information.

Sec. 1.13  Date of receipt of requests or appeals.

    The date of receipt of a request or appeal shall be the date it is 
received in the agency and office responsible for the administrative 
processing of FOIA requests or appeals.

[65 FR 46339, July 28, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 1.14  Appeals.

    (a) Requesters seeking administrative appeal of a denial of a 
request for records or denial of a fee waiver must ensure that the 
appeal is received by the agency within 45 days of the date of the 
denial letter.
    (b) Each agency shall provide for review of appeals by an official 
different from the official or officials designated to make initial 
denials.
    (c) 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(A)(ii) provides that each agency in the 
Department to which an appeal of a denial is submitted shall inform the 
requester of its determination concerning that appeal within 20 working 
days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays), plus any 
extension authorized by Sec. 1.16, of its date of receipt. If the agency 
determines to grant the appeal, it shall inform the requester of any 
conditions surrounding the granting of the request (e.g., payment of 
fees) and the approximate date upon which compliance will be effected. 
If the agency grants only a portion of the appeal, it shall treat the 
portion not granted as a denial. If it determines to deny the appeal 
either in part or in whole, it shall inform the requester of that 
decision and of the following:
    (1) The reasons for denial;
    (2) The name and title or position of each person responsible for 
denial of the appeal; and
    (3) The right to judicial review of the denial in accordance with 5 
U.S.C. 552(a)(4).

[[Page 13]]

    (d) Each agency, upon a determination that it wishes to deny an 
appeal, shall send a copy of the records requested and of all 
correspondence relating to the request to the Assistant General Counsel, 
General Law Division, Office of the General Counsel (``Assistant General 
Counsel''). When the volume of records is so large as to make sending a 
copy impracticable, the agency shall enclose an informative summary of 
those records. The agency shall not deny an appeal until it receives 
concurrence from the Assistant General Counsel
    (e) The Assistant General Counsel shall promptly review the matter 
(including necessary coordination with the agency) and render all 
necessary assistance to enable the agency to respond to the appeal 
within the administrative deadline or any extension of the 
administrative deadline.

any form or format the requester specifies, if the record is readily 
reproducible in that form of format. Agencies shall make reasonable 
efforts to maintain their records in forms or formats that are 
reproducible. In responding to requests for records, agencies shall make 
reasonable efforts to search for records in electronic form or format, 
except when such efforts would significantly interfere with the 
operation of an agency's automated information system. Such 
determinations shall be made on a case-by-case basis.
    (b) In the event a requested record contains some portions that are 
exempt from mandatory disclosure and others that are not, the official 
responding to the request shall ensure that all reasonably segregable 
nonexempt portions are disclosed, and that all exempt portions are 
identified according to the specific exemption or exemptions which are 
applicable. The amount of deleted information shall be indicated on the 
released portion of paper records. Deletions may be marked by use of 
brackets or darkened areas indicating removal of information, or by any 
other method that would reasonable demonstrate the extent of the 
deletion. In the case of electronic deletion, or deletion in audiovisual 
or microfiche records, if technically feasible, the amount of redacted 
information shall be indicated at the place in the records, if 
technically feasible, the amount of redacted information shall be 
indicated at the place in the record where such deletion was made. This 
may be done by use of brackets, shaded areas, or some other identifiable 
technique which will clearly show the limits of the deleted information.
    (c) If, in connection with a request or an appeal, a charge is to be 
made in accordance with sec. 8 of appendix A to this subpart, agencies 
shall inform the requester of the fee amount and of the basis for the 
charge. Each agency, in accordance with sec. 8 of appendix A to this 
subpart, may require payment of the entire fee, or a portion of the fee, 
before it provides the requested records. An agency shall require full 
payment of any delinquent fee owed by the requester plus any applicable 
interest prior to releasing records on a subsequent request or appeal. 
If a requester refuses to remit payment in advance, an agency may refuse 
to process the request or appeal with written notice to that effect 
forwarded to the requester. The ``date of receipt'' appeal for which 
advance payment has been required shall be the date that payment is 
received.
    (d) In the event compliance with the request or appeal involves 
inspection of records by the requester rather than providing copies of 
the records, the agency response shall include the name, mailing 
address, and telephone number of the person to be contacted to arrange a 
mutually convenient time for such inspection.
    (e) Whenever duplication fees, or search fees for unsuccessful 
searches (see sec. 4(f) of appendix A to this subpart), are anticipated 
to exceed $25.00, and the requester has not indicated, in advance, a 
willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated, agencies shall 
notify the requester of the amount of the anticipated fee. If an 
extensive and therefore costly successful search is anticipated, 
agencies also

[[Page 14]]

should notify requesters of the anticipated fees. The notification shall 
offer the requester the opportunity to confer with agency personnel to 
reform the request to meet the requester's needs at a lower fee. In 
appropriate cases, an advance deposit in accordance with sec. 8 of 
appendix A to this subpart may be required.

<R05>
Sec. 1.16  Extension of administrative deadlines.

    (a) In unusual circumstances as specified in this section, when 
additional time is needed to respond to the initial request or to an 
appeal, agencies shall acknowledge the request or the appeal in writing 
within the 20 working day time period, describe the unusual 
circumstances requiring the delay, and indicate the anticipated date for 
a substantive response that may not exceed 10 additional working days, 
except as provided in the following:
    (1) In instances in which the agency, with respect to a particular 
request, has extended the response date by 10 additional working days, 
if the agency finds that it cannot make a response determination within 
the additional 10 working day period, the agency shall notify the 
requester and provide the requester an opportunity to limit the scope of 
the request to allow the agency to process the request within the 
extended time limit, or an alternative time frame for processing the 
request or a modified request.
    (2) If the requester refuses to reasonably modify the request or 
arrange for an alternative time frame for processing the request, the 
FOIA provides that such refusal shall be considered as a factor in 
determining whether there are exceptional circumstances that warrant 
granting additional time for the agency to complete its review of the 
records, as set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(C)(iii). The term 
``exceptional circumstances'' does not include a delay that results from 
a predictable agency backlog, unless the agency demonstrates reasonable 
progress in reducing its backlog of pending requests.
    (b) As used in this section, ``unusual circumstances'' that may 
justify delay are:
    (1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from 
field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the 
office processing the request;
    (2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a 
voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in 
a single request; or
    (3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all 
practicable speed, with another Department or agency having a 
substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or 
more components of agency having substantial subject-matter interest in 
the request.

    Note to paragraph (b): Consultation regarding policy or legal issues 
between an agency and the Office of the General Counsel, Office of 
Communications, or the Department of Justice is not a basis for 
extension under this section.

    (c) The 10-day extension authorized by this section may be divided 
between the initial and appellate reviews, but in no event shall the 
total extension exceed 10 working days.
    (d) Nothing in this section shall preclude the agency and the 
requester from agreeing to an extension of time. Any such agreement 
should be confirmed in writing and should specify clearly the total time 
agreed upon.

<R05>
Sec. 1.17  Failure to meet administrative deadlines.

    In the event an agency fails to meet the administrative deadlines 
set forth in Secs. 1.7 or 1.14, plus any extension authorized by 
Sec. 1.16, it shall notify the requester, state the reasons for the 
delay, and the date by which it expects to dispatch a determination. 
Although the requester may be deemed to have exhausted his or her 
administrative remedies under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(C), the agency shall 
continue processing the request as expeditiously as possible and 
dispatch the determination when it is reached in the same manner and 
form as if it had been reached within the applicable deadline.

                  Appendix A to Subpart A--Fee Schedule

                           Section 1. General.

    This schedule sets forth fees to be charged for providing copies of 
records--including photographic reproductions, microfilm, maps and 
mosaics, and related services--under the Freedom of Information Act 
(FOIA). Records and related services are available at the locations 
specified by agencies in their FOIA implementing regulations. The fees 
set forth in this schedule are applicable to all agencies of the 
Department of Agriculture, and are based upon guidelines prescribed by 
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued at 52 FR 10012 (March 
27, 1987). No higher fees or charges in addition to those provided for 
in this schedule may be charged a party requesting services under the 
Freedom of Information Act.

       Section 2. Types of services for which fees may be charged.

    Subject to the criteria set forth in section 5 of this appendix, 
fees may be assessed under the Freedom of Information Act on all 
requests involving such services as record search, duplication, and 
review. Fees may also be charged in situations involving special service 
to a request, such as certifying that records requested are true copies, 
or sending records by special methods such as express mail, etc. For 
services not covered by the FOIA or by this appendix, agencies may set 
their own fees in accordance with applicable law, or costs incurred will 
be assessed the requester at the actual cost to the Government. For 
example, where records are required to be shipped from one office to 
another by commercial carrier in order to timely answer a request, the 
actual freight charge will be assessed the requester.

         Section 3. Instances in which fees will not be charged.

    (a) Except for requests seeking records for a commercial use (as 
specified in section 5 of this appendix), no charge shall be made for 
either: (1) The first 100 pages of duplicated records (8\1/2\" x 14" or 
smaller-size paper); or (2) The first two hours of manual search time, 
or the equivalent value of computer search time as defined in section 
4(e) of this appendix.
    (b) No charge shall be made--even to commercial use requesters--if 
the cost of collecting a fee would be equal to or greater than the fee 
itself. For USDA, this figure has been calculated to be $25.00.
    (c) Fees may not be charged for time spent by an agency employee in 
resolving legal or policy issues, or in monitoring a requester's 
inspection of agency records. No charge shall be made for normal postage 
costs.
    (d) Records shall also be furnished without charge under the 
following conditions:
    (1) When filling requests from other Departments or Government 
agencies for official use, provided quantities requested are reasonable 
in number;
    (2) When members of the public provide their own copying equipment, 
in which case no copying fee will be charged (although search and review 
fees may still be assessed); or
    (3) When any notices, decisions, orders, or other materials are 
required by law to be served on a party in any proceeding or matter 
before any Department agency.

            Section 4. Fees for records and related services.

    (a) The fee for photocopies of pages 8\1/2\" x 14" or smaller shall 
be $0.20 per page (per individual side of sheet).
    (b) The fee for photocopies larger than 8\1/2\" x 14" shall be $0.50 
per linear foot of the longest side of the copy.
    (c) The fee for other forms of duplicated records, such as 
microform, audio-visual materials, or machine-readable documentation 
(i.e., magnetic tape or disk), shall be the actual direct cost of 
producing the records.
    (d) Manual searches shall be charged for in one of the two following 
manners in the given order:
    (1) When feasible, at the salary rate of the employee conducting the 
search, plus 16 percent of the employee's basic pay; or
    (2) Where a homogeneous class of personnel is used exclusively, at 
the rate of $10.00 per hour for clerical time, and $20.00 per hour for 
supervisory or professional time. Charges should be computed to the 
nearest quarter hour required for the search. A homogeneous class of 
personnel, for purposes of conducting manual searches and where more 
than one individual is involved, is a group of employees of like rank, 
grade, pay or position. A heterogeneous class of personnel is a group of 
employees of unlike rank, grade, pay, or position. If a heterogeneous 
class of personnel is involved in a search then the search shall be 
charged for at the salary rate of the individuals.
    (e) Mainframe computer searches and services shall be charged for at 
the rates established in the Users Manual or Handbook published by the 
computer center at which the work will be performed. Where the rate has 
not been established, the rate shall be $27.00 per minute. Searches 
using computers other than mainframes shall be charged for at the manual 
search rate.
    (1) Other rates are published and may be examined at the following

pursuant to section 6 of this appendix. No higher fees or charges in 
addition to those provided for in this appendix may be charged for 
services under the FOIA.
    (k) The fees specified in paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section and 
in section 17 of this appendix apply to requests for services other than 
those subject to the FOIA. The authority for establishment of these fees 
is at 31 U.S.C. 9701 and other applicable laws.
    (l) Except as provided in section 11 of this appendix, for services 
not subject to the FOIA, and not covered by paragraph (h) of this 
section, agencies may set their own fees in accordance with applicable 
law.

       Section 5. Levels of fees for each category of requesters.

    Under the FOIA, there are four categories of FOIA requesters: 
Commercial use requesters, educational and non-commercial scientific 
institutions; representatives of the news media; and all other 
requesters. FOIA prescribes specific levels of fees for each category:
    (a) Commercial use requesters--For commercial use requesters, 
agencies shall assess charges which recover the full direct costs of 
searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the records 
sought. Commercial use requesters are not entitled to the free search 
time or duplication referenced in section 3(a) of this appendix. 
Agencies may recover the cost of searching for and reviewing records for 
commercial use requesters even if there is ultimately no disclosure of 
records.
    (1) A commercial use requester is defined as one who seeks 
information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or 
profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the 
request is made.
    (2) In determining whether a requester properly belongs in this 
category, agencies must determine whether the requester will put the 
records to a commercial use. Where an agency has reasonable cause to 
doubt the use to which a requester will put the records sought, or where 
that use is not clear from the request itself, the agency may seek 
additional clarification from the requester.
    (b) Educational and non-commercial scientific institution 
requesters--Fees for this category of requesters shall be limited to the 
cost of providing duplication service alone, minus the charge for the 
first 100 reproduced pages. No charge shall be made for search or review 
services. To qualify for this category, requesters must show that the 
request is being made as authorized by and under the auspices of an 
eligible institution and that the records are not sought for a 
commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of scholarly research (if 
the request is from an educational institution) or scientific research 
(if the request is from a non-commercial scientific institution).
    (1) The term educational institution refers to a preschool, a public 
or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate 
higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an 
institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational 
education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.
    (2) The term non-commercial scientific institution refers to 
institution that is not operated on a ``commercial'' (see section 
5(a)(1)) of this appendix basis, and which is operated solely for the 
purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not 
intended to promote any particular product or industry.
    (c) Requesters who are representatives of the news media--Fees for 
this category of requesters shall also be limited to the cost of 
providing duplication service alone, minus the charge for the first 100 
reproduced pages. No charge shall be made for providing search or review 
services. Requests in this category must not be made for a commercial 
use.

[[Page 19]]

    (1) The term representative of the news media refers to any person 
actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to 
publish or broadcast news to the public.
    (2) The term news means information that is about current events or 
that would be of current interest to the public.
    (3) Examples of news media entities include television or radio 
stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of 
periodicals which disseminate news and who make their products available 
for purchase or subscription by the general public.
    (4) Freelance journalists may be regarded as working for a news 
organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting 
publication through that organization, even though not actually employed 
by it.
    (d) All other requesters--Fees for requesters who do not fit into 
the categories described in paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section 
shall be assessed for the full reasonable direct cost of searching for 
and duplicating records that are responsive to a request. No charge, 
however, shall be made to requesters in this category for: (1) The first 
100 duplicated pages; or (2) the first two hours of manual search time, 
or the equivalent value of computer search time as defined in section 
4(e) of this appendix.

                 Section 6. Fee waivers and reductions.

    (a) Agencies shall waive or reduce fees on request for records if 
disclosure of the information in the records is deemed to be in the 
public interest. A request is in the public interest if it is likely to 
contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or 
activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial 
interest of the requester.
    (1) In determining when fees shall be waived or reduced, agencies 
should consider the following six factors:
    (i) The subject of the request, i.e., whether the subject of the 
requested records concerns ``the operations or activities of the 
government'';
    (ii) The informative value of the information to be disclosed, i.e., 
whether the disclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an understanding 
of government operations or activities;
    (iii) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the 
general public likely to result from disclosure, i.e., whether 
disclosure of the requested information will contribute to ``public 
understanding'';
    (iv) The significance of the contribution to public understanding, 
i.e., whether the disclosure is likely to contribute ``significantly'' 
to public understanding of government operations or activities;
    (v) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest, i.e., 
whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered 
by the requested disclosure; and,
    (vi) The primary interest in disclosure, i.e., whether the magnitude 
of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently 
large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that 
disclosure is ``primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.''
    (2) An agency may, in its discretion, waive or reduce fees 
associated with a request for disclosure, regardless of whether a waiver 
or reduction has been requested, if the agency determines that 
disclosure will primarily benefit the general public.
    (3) Agencies may also waive or reduce fees under the following 
conditions:
    (i) Where the furnishings of records or a service without charge or 
at a reduced rate is an appropriate courtesy to a foreign country or 
international organization, or where comparable fees are set on a 
reciprocal basis with a foreign country or an international 
organization;
    (ii) Where the requester is engaged in a nonprofit activity designed 
for the public safety, health, or welfare; or
    (iii) Where it is determined that payment of the full fee by a State 
or local government or nonprofit group would not be in the interest of 
the program involved.
    (4) Fees shall be waived, however, without discretion in all

fee, an agency may require the requester to pay the full amount owed, 
plus any applicable interest as provided in section 9 of this appendix, 
as well as the full estimated fee associated with any new request before

levying interest charges on an upaid bill starting on the 31st day

by statutes, executive orders and regulations.
    (2) Whenever the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for 
hearing, that a person who is acting or has acted as counsel or 
representative in any hearing or other proceeding before the Department 
has not conformed to any such standards of ethical conduct, the 
Secretary may order that such person be precluded from acting as counsel 
or representative in any hearing or other proceeding before the 
Department for such period of time as the Secretary deems warranted. 
Whenever the Secretary has probable cause to believe that any person who 
is acting or has acted as counsel or representative in any such hearing 
or other proceeding has not conformed to any such standards of ethical 
conduct, the Secretary may, by written notice to such person, suspend 
the person from acting as such a counsel or representative pending 
completion of the procedures specified in the preceding sentence.
    (3) No employee or former employee of the Department shall be 
permitted to represent any person before the Department in connection 
with any particular matter as to which by reason of employment with the 
Department the employee or former employee acquired personal knowledge 
of such a nature that it would be improper, unethical, or contrary to 
the public interest for the employee or former employee so to act.
    (4) This section shall not be construed to prevent an employee or 
former employee of the Department from appearing as a witness in any 
hearing or other proceeding before the Department.

notice determines that the submission may be withheld under the Freedom 
of Information Act.

section for confidential treatment of a written submission, the person 
making the request shall be informed promptly in the event the request 
is denied and afforded an opportunity to withdraw the submission.
    (3) If a determination is made to grant a request for confidential 
treatment under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, a statement of the 
specific basis for the determination that will not be susceptible of 
identifying the person making the request will be made available for 
public inspection.
    (e) If the subject of the notice is such that meaningful submissions 
cannot be expected unless they disclose information that may be withheld 
under the Freedom of Information Act, the notice shall so indicate and 
contain a statement that written submissions pursuant to the notice will 
be treated as confidential and withheld under the Freedom of Information 
Act. Provided, That the policy regarding availability of written 
submissions set forth in this paragraph may only be used with the prior 
approval of the Secretary, or the Under Secretary or Assistant Secretary 
that administers the program that is the subject of the notice.

<R04>
          Subpart E--Cooperative Production of Television Films

    Source:  22 FR 2904, Apr. 25, 1957, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1.71  Purpose.

    This subpart establishes procedures for developing special working 
relationships with the Department of Agriculture requested by producers 
of films for television use. These procedures are designed to guide 
Department employees and producers of commercial television pictures in 
entering into such arrangements.


<R05>
Sec. 1.72  Policy.

    (a) General. It is a basic policy of the Department of Agriculture 
to make information freely available to the public.
    (b) Cooperation with television film producers. The Department 
recognizes that its people and programs constitute a rich source of 
materials on public services, often dramatic and interesting for their 
human values, which are suitable for production of films for television 
showings. The Department welcomes the interest of television film 
producers in its activities and maintains an ``open door'' policy with 
respect to the availability of factual information to such producers, as 
it does to representatives of other media. As its resources will permit, 
the Department will work with producers at their request, to assure 
technical accuracy of scripts and story treatments.
    (c) Special working relationships. In those instances where a 
producer of films for television seeks special Department participation 
such as the use of official insignia of the Department, or who request 
special assistance such as the services of technical advisors, use of 
Government equipment and similar aids which require a material 
expenditure of public funds, and where the proposed film will further 
the public service of the Department, the Department will consider 
entering into a special working relationship with such producer.
    (d) News film reporting exempted. Television and news film reporting 
of Department activities is not covered by this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 1.73  Responsibility.

    The Director of Information or his designee will be the authority 
for the approval of special working relationships on the part of the 
Department of Agriculture and its agencies. The Director or his designee 
shall not commit the Department to such special arrangements without 
proper concurrence and coordination with interested agencies and 
approval by the appropriate Assistant Secretary or Group Director.


<R05>
Sec. 1.74  Basis for special working relationships.

    The Department and its agencies may lend special assistance on 
television films when it is clearly evident that public interests are 
served. Where special assistance is sought, an individual cooperative 
agreement will be drawn up between the Department with the Director of 
Information as its agent, and the producer. Details on such assistance 
as reviewing stories and scripts, loan of material, arrangements for 
locations, use of official motion picture footage, assignment of 
technical advisors and similar aids will be covered in the agreement, 
which shall delineate the general stipulations listed in Sec. 1.75.


<R05>
Sec. 1.75  General stipulations.

    In requesting special working arrangements the producer must agree 
to the following stipulations:
    (a) The producer must show that he has legal authority to the 
literary property concerned.
    (b) The producer must show access to a distribution channel

proposed undertaking).

[[Page 26]]

    (c) The commercial advertising of any show produced, using oral or 
written rights granted to the producer, shall not indicate any 
endorsement, either direct or implied, by the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture or its agencies, of the sponsor's product.

Sec. 1.76  Department cooperation.

    When the producer agrees to meet the above stipulations to the 
satisfaction of the Director of Information, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture and its agencies will be available for consultation on story 
ideas and give guidance through the services of a technical advisor to 
insure technical authenticity. Equipment, locations, and personnel will 
be available to the extent that such availability is concurrent with 
normal and usual conduct of the operations of the Department. The 
Department will check and work with the cooperators to arrange shooting 
schedules in order to avoid interferences with working schedules.


<R05>
Sec. 1.77  Assignment of priorities.

    (a) Authority. (1) The Director of Information or his designee will 
make assignment of priorities for the U.S. Department of Agriculture for 
a television film company's and/or individual producer's story treatment 
of the subject matter, but no such priority shall limit use of the 
subject matter itself.
    (2) A priority will be given in writing upon acceptance in writing 
by the producer of the stipulations in Sec. 1.75(b). The U.S. Department 
of Agriculture will hold the producer's treatment of the story material 
in confidence until the producer has made a public release pertaining to 
the subject.
    (b) Time and scope. A priority will be given on the producer's story 
treatment for an agreed upon period of time. Requests for cooperation 
with similar or conflicting ideas and backgrounds will be considered 
only after holder of the first priority has used the agreed upon time to 
develop the materials.
    (1) Details on priorities will be written into the agreements.
    (2) The Director of Information will retain the right to cancel 
priorities when the producer at any stage violates the provisions of the 
regulations or of a particular agreement, or when public interest is no 
longer served.
    (3) No priority will be canceled until the producer has had an 
opportunity to appear before the Secretary of Agriculture or his 
designee.


<R05>
Sec. 1.78  Development of special working relationships.

of an agreement, assistance may be given by the Department or one of its 
agencies in outlining story plans, visits to field points, and other 
incidentals that will assist the producer in determining his course of 
action.
    (b) Request for special working arrangements. Once the decision is 
made to go ahead with an agreement, either the interested agency or the 
producer will make a written submission to the Director of Information, 
requesting that special working arrangements be established.
    (1) In submitting scripts prior or subsequent to executing a written 
agreement under a special working relationship four (4) copies of the 
completed script shall be submitted to the Director of Information or 
his designee, along with a statement of specific requirements and the 
anticipated production schedule.
    (2) No script will be used under a special working relationship 
without the

[[Page 27]]

specific approval of the Director of Information.
    (3) Upon approval of the script, the agency of the Department 
concerned with subject matter will endeavor to arrange for the desired 
assistance with the stipulations of this policy.

<R05>

maintained by an agency contains any record pertaining to him or her, or 
to request access to such records, shall submit a written request in 
accordance with the instructions set forth in the system notice for that 
system of records. This request shall include:

<R05>
Sec. 1.113  Times, places, and requirements for identification of individuals making requests.

    (a) If an individual submitting a request for access under 
Sec. 1.112 has asked that an agency authorize a personal inspection of 
records pertaining to him or her, and the agency has granted that 
request, the requester shall present himself or herself at the time and 
place specified in the agency's response or arrange another, mutually 
convenient, time with the appropriate agency official.
    (b) Prior to inspection of the records, the requester shall present 
sufficient identification (e.g., driver's license, employee 
identification card, social security card, credit cards) to establish 
that the requester is the individual to whom the records pertain. If the 
requester is unable to provide such identification, the requester shall 
complete and sign in the presence of an agency official a signed 
statement asserting the requester's identity and stipulating that the 
requester understands that knowingly or willfully seeking or obtaining 
access to records about another

[[Page 28]]

individual under false pretenses is a misdemeanor punishable by fine up 
to $5,000. No identification shall be required, however, if the records 
are required by 5 U.S.C. 552 to be released.
    (c) Any individual who has requested access to records about himself 
or herself by personal inspection, and who wishes to have another person 
or persons accompany the requester during this inspection, shall submit 
a written statement authorizing disclosure of the record in the presence 
of such other person or persons.
    (d) Any individual having made a personal inspection of records 
pertaining to the requester may request the agency to provide the 
requester copies of those records or any portion of those records. Each 
agency shall grant such requests but may charge fees in accordance with 
Sec. 1.120.
    (e) If an individual submitting a request for access under 
Sec. 1.112 wishes to be supplied with copies of the records by mail, the 
requester shall include with his or her request sufficient data for the 
agency to verify the requester's identity. If the sensitivity of the 
records warrant it, however, the agency to which the request is directed 
may require the requester to submit a signed, notarized statement 
indicating that the requester is the individual to whom the records 
pertain and stipulating the requester understands that knowingly or 
willfully seeking or obtaining access to records about another 
individual under false pretenses is a misdemeanor punishable by fine up 
to $5,000. No identification shall be required, however, if the records 
are required by 5 U.S.C. 552 to be released. If the agency to which this 
request is directed determines to grant the requested access, it may 
charge fees in accordance with Sec. 1.120 before making the necessary 
copies.

<R05>
Sec. 1.114  Disclosure of requested information to individuals.

    (a) Any agency which receives a request or appeal under Sec. 1.112 
should acknowledge the request or appeal within 10 days of its receipt 
(excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). Wherever 
practicable, the acknowledgment should indicate whether or not access 
will be granted and, if so, when and where. When access is to be 
granted, the agency should provide the access within 30 days of receipt 
of the request or appeal (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal public 
holidays) unless, for good cause shown, it is unable to do so. If the 
agency is unable to meet this deadline, it shall inform the requester of 
this fact, the reasons for its inability to do so, and an estimate of 
the date on which access will be granted.
    (b) Nothing in 5 U.S.C. 552a or this subpart shall be interpreted to 
require that an individual making a request under Sec. 1.112 be granted 
access to the physical record itself. The form in which a record is kept 
(e.g., on magnetic tape), or the content of the record (e.g., a record 
indexed under the name of the requester may contain records which are 
not about the requester) may require that the record be edited or 
translated in some manner. Neither of these procedures may be utilized, 
however, to withhold information in a record about the requester.
    (c) No agency shall deny any request under Sec. 1.112 for 
information concerning the existence of records about the requester in 
any system of records it maintains, or deny any request for access to 
records about the requester in any system of records it maintains, 
unless that system is exempted from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) 
in Sec. 1.123.
    (d) If any agency receives a request pursuant to Sec. 1.112(a) for 
access to records in a system of records it maintains which is so 
exempted, the system manager shall determine if the exemption is to be 
asserted. If the system manager determines to deny the request, the 
system manager shall inform the requester of that determination, the 
reason for the determination, and the title and address of the agency 
head to whom the denial can be appealed.
    (e) If the head of an agency determines that an appeal pursuant to 
Sec. 1.112(b) is to be denied, the head of the agency shall inform the 
requester of that determination, the reason for the determination, and 
the requester's

[[Page 29]]

right under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g) to seek judicial review of the denial in 
Federal district court.
    (f) Nothing in 5 U.S.C. 552a or this subpart shall allow an 
individual access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation 
of a civil action or proceeding.

<R05>
Sec. 1.115  Special procedures: Medical records.

    In the event an agency receives a request pursuant to Sec. 1.112 for 
access to medical records (including psychological records) whose 
disclosure it determines would be harmful to the individual to whom they 
relate, it may refuse to disclose the records directly to the requester 
but shall transmit them to a doctor designated by that individual.


<R05>
Sec. 1.116  Request for correction or amendment to record.

    (a) Any individual who wishes to request correction or amendment of 
any record pertaining to him or her contained in a system of records 
maintained by an agency shall submit that request in writing in 
accordance with the instructions set forth in the system notice for that 
system of records. This request shall include:
    (1) The name of the individual making the request;
    (2) The name of the system of records (as set forth in the system 
notice to which the request relates);
    (3) A description of the nature (e.g., modification, addition or 
deletion) and substance of the correction or amendment requested; and
    (4) Any other information specified in the system notice.
    (b) Any individual submitting a request pursuant to paragraph (a) of 
this section shall include sufficient information in support of that 
request to allow the agency to which it is addressed to apply the 
standards set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552a(e) (1) and (5).
    (c) Any individual whose request under paragraph (a) of this section 
is denied may appeal that denial to the head of the agency which 
maintains the system of records to which the request relates.
    (d) In the event that an appeal under paragraph (c) of this section 
is denied, the requester may bring a civil action in federal district 
court to seek review of the denial.

<R05>
Sec. 1.117  Agency review of request for correction or amendment of record.

    (a) Any agency which receives a request for amendment or correction 
under Sec. 1.116 shall acknowledge that request within 10 days of its 
receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays). The 
agency shall also promptly, either:
    (1) Make any correction, deletion or addition with regard to any 
portion of a record which the requester believes is not accurate, 
relevant, timely or complete; or
    (2) Inform the requester of its refusal to amend the record in 
accordance with the request; the reason for the refusal; the procedures 
whereby the requester can appeal the refusal to the head of the agency; 
and the title and business address of that official. If the agency 
informs the requester of its determination within the 10-day deadline, a 
separate acknowledgement is not required.
    (b) If an agency is unable to comply with either paragraphs (a)(1) 
or (2) of this section within 30 days of its receipt of a request for 
correction or amendment, (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal public 
holidays), it should inform the requester of that fact, the reasons for 
the inability to comply with paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section 
within 30 days, and the approximate date on which a determination will 
be reached.
    (c) In conducting its review of a request for correction or 
amendment, each agency shall be guided by the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 
552a(e)(1) and (5).
    (d) If an agency determines to grant all or any portion of a request 
for correction or amendment, it shall:
    (1) Advise the individual of that determination;
    (2) Make the requested correction or amendment; and
    (3) Inform any person or agency outside USDA to whom the record has 
been disclosed, if an accounting of that

[[Page 30]]

disclosure is maintained in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(c), of the 
occurrence and substance of the correction or amendments.
    (e) If an agency determines not to grant all or any portion of a 
request for correction or amendment, it shall:
    (1) Comply with paragraph (d) of this section with regard to any 
correction or amendment which is made;
    (2) Advise the requester of its determination and the reasons for 
the determination not to grant all or a portion of the request for a 
correction or amendment;
    (3) Inform the requester that he or she may appeal this 
determination to the head of the agency which maintains the system of 
records; and
    (4) Describe the procedures for making such an appeal, including the 
title and business address of the official to whom the appeal is to be 
addressed.
    (f) In the event that an agency receives a notice of correction or 
amendment to information in a record contained in a system of records 
which it maintains, it shall comply with paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of 
this section in the same manner as if it had made the correction or 
amendment itself.

[40 FR 39519, Aug. 28, 1975, as amended at 62 FR 33981, June 24, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 1.118  Appeal of initial adverse agency determination on correction or amendment.

    (a) Any individual whose request for correction or amendment under 
Sec. 1.116 is denied, and who wishes to appeal that denial, shall 
address such appeal to the head of the agency which maintains the system 
of records to which the request relates, in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in the agency's initial denial of the request.
    (b) The head of each agency shall make a final determination with 
regard to an appeal submitted under paragraph (a) of this section not 
later than 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public 
holidays) from the date on which the individual requests a review, 
unless, for good cause shown, the head of the agency extends this 30-day 
period and so notifies the requester, together with an estimate of the 
date on which a final determination will be made. Such extension should 
be utilized only in exceptional circumstances and should not normally 
exceed 30 days. The delegation of authority set forth in this paragraph 
may not be redelegated.

(a) of this section, the head of an agency shall be guided by the

    (e) If the head of an agency determines in accordance with paragraph 
(c) of this section not to grant all or any portion of an appeal 
submitted under paragraph (a) of this section, the head of the agency 
shall inform the requester:
    (1) Of this determination and the reasons for the determination;
    (2) Of the requester's right to file a concise statement of the 
requester's reasons for disagreeing with the agency's decision;
    (3) Of the procedures for filing such a statement of disagreement;
    (4) That such statements of disagreements will be made available to 
anyone to whom the record is subsequently disclosed, together with (if 
the agency deems it appropriate) a brief statement by the agency 
summarizing its reasons for refusing to amend the record;
    (5) That prior recipients of the disputed record will be provided 
with a copy of the statement of disagreement, together with (if the 
agency deems it appropriate) a brief statement of the agency's reasons 
for refusing to amend the record, to the extent that an accounting of 
disclosures is maintained under 5 U.S.C. 552a(c); and
    (6) Of the requester's right to seek judicial review of the agency's 
determination in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(g). The agency shall 
insure that any statements of disagreement submitted by a requester are 
handled in accordance with paragraphs (e)(4) and (5) of this section.

of records subject to 5 U.S.C. 552a and the regulations of this subpart

individual as is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the 
agency required to be accomplished by statute or by executive order of 
the President;
    (b) Collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly 
from the subject individual when the information may result in adverse 
determinations about an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges 
under Federal programs;
    (c) Inform each individual whom it asks to supply information, on 
the form which it uses to collect the information, or on a separate form 
that can be retained by the individual, of:
    (1) The authority (whether granted by statute, or by executive order 
of the President) which authorizes the solicitation of the information 
and whether disclosure of such information is mandatory or voluntary;
    (2) The principal purpose or purposes for which the information is 
intended to be used;
    (3) The routine uses which may be made of the information, as 
published pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section; and

    (1) The name and location(s) of the system;
    (2) The categories of individuals on whom records are maintained in

    (3) The categories of records maintained in the system;
    (4) Each routine use of the records contained in the system,

    (5) The policies and practices of the agency regarding storage,

    (9) The categories of sources of records in the system;
    (e) Maintain all records which are used by the agency in making any 
determination about any individual with such accuracy, relevance, 
timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure 
fairness to the individual in the determination;
    (f) Prior to disseminating any record about an individual to any 
person other than an agency, unless the dissemination is made pursuant 
to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(2), make reasonable efforts to assure that such 
records are accurate, complete, timely, and relevant for agency 
purposes;

compulsory legal process when such process becomes a matter of public 
record;
    (i) Establish rules of conduct for persons involved in the design, 
development, operation, or maintenance of any system of records, or in 
maintaining any record, and instruct each such person with respect to 
such rules and the requirements of this section, including any other 
rules and procedures adopted pursuant to this section and the penalties 
for noncompliance;
    (j) Establish appropriate administrative, technical, and physical

[[Page 34]]

threats or hazards to their security or integrity which could result in 
substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to any 
individual on whom information is maintained.
    Sec. 2 Amendment of routine uses for an existing system of records, 
or establishment of a new system of records.
    (a) Any agency which intends to add a routine use, or amend an 
existing one, in a system of records it maintains, shall, in accordance 
with 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(11), ensure that at least 30 days advance notice 
of such action is given by publication in the Federal Register and an 
opportunity provided for interested persons to submit written data, 
views or arguments to the agency.
    (b) Any agency which intends to establish a new system of records, 
or to alter any existing system of records, shall insure that adequate 
advance notice is provided to Congress and the Office of Management and 
Budget to permit an evaluation of the probable or potential effect of 
such action on the privacy and other personal or property rights of 
individuals or the disclosure of information relating to such 
individuals, and its effect on the preservation of the constitutional 
principles of federalism and separation of powers. Such notice is 
required for any new system of records and for any alteration in an 
existing one which will:
    (1) Increase the number or types of individuals on whom records are 
maintained;
    (2) Expand the type or amount of information maintained;
    (3) Increase the number or categories of agencies or other persons 
who may have access to those records;
    (4) Alter the manner in which the records are organized so as to 
change the nature or scope of those records (e.g., the combining of two 
or more existing systems);
    (5) Modify the way the system operates at its location(s) in such a 
manner as to alter the procedures by which individuals can exercise 
their rights under this subpart; or
    (6) Change the equipment configuration on which the system is 
operated so as to create the potential for greater access (e.g., adding 
a telecommunications capability).
    Sec. 3 Accounting of certain disclosures. Each agency, with respect 
to each system of records under its control, shall:
    (a) Except for disclosures made under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(1) and (2), 
keep an accurate account of:
    (1) The date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure of a record to 
any person or agency outside the Department; and
    (2) The name and address of the person or agency to whom the 
disclosure is made;
    (b) Retain the accounting made under paragraph (a) of this section 
for the longer of a period of five years, after the date of the 
disclosure for which the accounting is made, or the life of the record 
disclosed;
    (c) Except for disclosures made under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(7), make the 
accounting required under paragraph (a) of this section available to the 
individual named in the record at his or her request.
    Sec. 4 Government contractors. When an agency within the Department 
provides by a contract for the operation by or on behalf of the agency 
of a system of records to accomplish an agency function, the agency 
shall, consistent with its authority, cause the requirements of this 
subpart to be applied to such system. For purposes of 5 U.S.C. 552a(i) 
any such contractor or any employee of such contractor shall be 
considered to be an employee of an agency and therefore subject to the 
criminal penalties set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552a(i).
    Sec. 5 Mailing lists. No agency within the Department shall sell or 
rent any individual's name and address unless such action is 
specifically authorized by law. This section shall not be construed to 
require, or to authorize, the withholding of names and addresses whose 
disclosure is required by 5 U.S.C. 552.
    Sec. 6 Social security account numbers. (a) No agency shall deny, or 
permit any State or local government with whom it is involved in a 
cooperative venture to deny, to any individual any right, benefit, or 
privilege provided by law because of such individual's refusal to 
disclose his or her social security account number.
    (b) Paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply with respect to:
    (1) Any disclosure required by Federal statute; or
    (2) Any disclosure to any agency relating to a system of records it 
maintained prior to January 1, 1975, if such disclosure was required 
under statute or regulation adopted prior to that date, to verify the 
identity of an individual.
    (c) Any agency in the Department which requests an individual to 
disclose his or her social security account number shall inform that 
individual whether the disclosure is mandatory or voluntary, by what 
statutory or other authority the number is solicited, and what uses will 
be made of it. The agency shall also insure that this information is 
provided by a State or local government with whom it is involved in a 
cooperative agreement.
    Sec. 7. Annual report. Each agency in the Department shall submit to 
the Office of the General Counsel prior to March 30 of each year a 
report containing the following information related to implementation of 
5 U.S.C. 552a:
    (a) A summary of major accomplishments;
    (b) A summary of major plans for activities in the upcoming year;
    (c) A list of the systems which were exempted during the year from 
any of the operative provisions of this subpart pursuant to 5

[[Page 35]]

U.S.C. 552a (j) and (k), whether or not the exemption was effected 
during that year, the number of instances with respect to each system 
exempted in which the exemption was invoked to deny access, and the 
reasons for invoking the exemption;
    (d) A brief summary of changes to the total inventory of personal 
data system subject to this subpart including reasons for major changes; 
and
    (e) A general description of operational experiences including 
estimates of the number of individuals (in relation to the total number 
of records in the system):
    (1) Requesting information on the existence of records pertaining to 
them;
    (2) Refusing to provide information;
    (3) Requesting access to their records;
    (4) Appealing initial refusals to amend records; and
    (5) Seeking redress through the courts.
    Sec. 8. Effect of 5 U.S.C. 552. No agency in the Department shall 
rely on any exemption in 5 U.S.C. 552 to withhold from an individual any 
record which is otherwise accessible to such individual under 5 U.S.C. 
552a and this subpart.

    (ix) Amount of damage claimed, if any;
    (x) Statement of other material facts, including terms of contract; 
and
    (xi) So far as practicable, true copies of all available papers 
relating to the transaction complained about, including shipping 
documents, letters, telegrams, invoices, manifests, inspection 
certificates, accounts of sales and any special contracts or agreements.
    (3) Upon receipt of the information and supporting evidence, the 
Administrator shall cause such investigation to be made as, in the 
opinion of the Administrator, is justified by the facts. If such 
investigation discloses that no violation of the Act or of the 
regulations, standards, instructions, or orders issued pursuant thereto, 
has occurred, no further action shall be taken and the person submitting 
the information shall be so informed.
    (4) The person submitting the information shall not be a party to 
any proceeding which may be instituted as a result thereof and such 
person shall have no legal status in the proceeding, except as a 
subpoenaed witness or as a

[[Page 38]]

deponent in a deposition taken without expense to such person.
    (b) Filing of complaint or petition for review. (1) If there is 
reason to believe that a person has violated or is violating any 
provision of a statute listed in Sec. 1.131 or of any regulation, 
standard, instruction or order issued pursuant thereto, whether based 
upon information furnished under paragraph (a) of this section or other 
information, a complaint may be filed with the Hearing Clerk pursuant to 
these rules.
    (2) Any person determined by the Chief, PACA Branch, pursuant to 7 
CFR 47.47-47.68 to have been responsibly connected within the meaning of 
7 U.S.C. 499a(9) to a licensee who is subject or potentially subject to 
license suspension or revocation as the result of an alleged violation 
of 7 U.S.C. 499b or 499h(b) or as provided in 7 U.S.C. 499g(d) shall be 
entitled to institute a proceeding under this section and to have 
determined the facts with respect to such responsibly connected status 
by filing with the Hearing Clerk a petition for review of such 
determination.
    (3) As provided in 5 U.S.C. 558, in any case, except one of 
willfulness or one in which public health, interest, or safety otherwise 
requires, prior to the institution of a formal proceeding which may 
result in the withdrawal, suspension, or revocation of a ``license'' as 
that term is defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(8), the Administrator, in an effort 
to effect an amicable or informal settlement of the matter, shall give 
written notice to the person involved of the facts or conduct concerned 
and shall afford such person an opportunity, within a reasonable time 
fixed by the Administrator, to demonstrate or achieve compliance with 
the applicable requirements of the statute, or the regulation, standard, 
instruction or order promulgated thereunder.

    (a) Complaint. A complaint filed pursuant to Sec. 1.133(b) shall 
state briefly and clearly the nature of the proceeding, the 
identification of the complainant and the respondent, the legal 
authority and jurisdiction under which the proceeding is instituted, the 
allegations of fact and provisions of law which constitute a basis for 
the proceeding, and the nature of the relief sought.
    (b) Petition for review. The Petition for Review of responsibly 
connected status shall describe briefly and clearly the determination

and legal matters that the petitioner believes warrant the reversal of 
the determination.

<R05>
Sec. 1.136  Answer.

    (a) Filing and service. Within 20 days after the service of the 
complaint (within 10 days in a proceeding under section 4(d) of the 
Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, 1930), or such other time as 
may be specified therein, the respondent shall file with the Hearing 
Clerk an answer signed by the respondent or the attorney of record in 
the proceeding. The attorney may file an appearance of record prior to 
or simultaneously with the filing of the answer. The answer shall be 
served upon the complainant, and any other party of record, by the 
Hearing Clerk. As response to a petition for review of responsibly 
connected status, the Chief, PACA Branch, shall within ten days after 
being served by the Hearing Clerk with a petition for review, file with 
the Hearing Clerk a certified copy of the agency record upon which the 
Chief, PACA Branch, made the determination that the individual was 
responsibly connected to a licensee under the Perishable Agricultural 
Commodities Act, 7 U.S.C. 499a et seq., and such agency record shall 
become part of the record in the review proceeding.
    (b) Contents. The answer shall:

[[Page 39]]

    (1) Clearly admit, deny, or explain each of the allegations of the 
Complaint and shall clearly set forth any defense asserted by the 
respondent; or
    (2) State that the respondent admits all the facts alleged in the 
complaint; or
    (3) State that the respondent admits the jurisdictional allegations 
of the complaint and neither admits nor denies the remaining allegations 
and consents to the issuance of an order without further procedure.
    (c) Default. Failure to file an answer within the time provided 
under Sec. 1.136(a) shall be deemed, for purposes of the proceeding, an 
admission of the allegations in the Complaint, and failure to deny or 
otherwise respond to an allegation of the Complaint shall be deemed, for 
purposes of the proceeding, an admission of said allegation, unless the 
parties have agreed to a consent decision pursuant to Sec. 1.138.

[42 FR 743, Jan. 4, 1977, as amended at 61 FR 11504, Mar. 21, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1.137  Amendment of complaint, petition for review, or answer; joinder of related matters.

    (a) Amendment. At any time prior to the filing of a motion for a 
hearing, the complaint, petition for review, answer, or response to 
petition for review may be amended. Thereafter, such an amendment may be 
made with consent of the parties, or as authorized by the Judge upon a 
showing of good cause.
    (b) Joinder. The Judge shall consolidate for hearing with any 
proceeding alleging a violation of the Perishable Agricultural 
Commodities Act, 7 U.S.C. 499a et seq., any petitions for review of 
determination of status by the Chief, PACA Branch, that individuals are 
responsibly connected, within the meaning of 7 U.S.C. 499a(9), to the 
licensee during the period of the alleged violations. In any case in 
which there is no pending proceeding alleging a violation of the 
Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, 7 U.S.C. 499a et seq., but 
there have been filed more than one petition for review of determination 
of responsible connection to the same licensee, such petitions for 
review shall be consolidated for hearing.

[61 FR 11504, Mar. 21, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1.138  Consent decision.

    At any time before the Judge files the decision, the parties may 
agree to the entry of a consent decision. Such agreement shall be filed 
with the Hearing Clerk in the form of a decision signed by the parties 
with appropriate space for signature by the Judge, and shall contain an 
admission of at least the jurisdictional facts, consent to the issuance 
of the agreed decision without further procedure and such other 
admissions or statements as may be agreed between the parties. The Judge 
shall enter such decision without further procedure, unless an error is 
apparent on the face of the document. Such decision shall have the same 
force and effect as a decision issued after full hearing, and shall 
become final upon issuance to become effective in accordance with the 
terms of the decision.


<R05>
Sec. 1.139  Procedure upon failure to file an answer or admission of facts.

    The failure to file an answer, or the admission by the answer of all 
the material allegations of fact contained in the complaint, shall 
constitute a waiver of hearing. Upon such admission or failure to file, 
complainant shall file a proposed decision, along with a motion for the 
adoption thereof, both of which shall be served upon the respondent by 
the Hearing Clerk. Within 20 days after service of such motion and 
proposed decision, the respondent may file with the Hearing Clerk 
objections thereto. If the Judge finds that meritorious objections have 
been filed, complainant's Motion shall be denied with supporting 
reasons. If meritorious objections are not filed, the Judge shall issue 
a decision without further procedure or hearing. Copies of the decision 
or denial of complainant's Motion shall be served by the Hearing Clerk 
upon each of the parties and may be appealed pursuant to Sec. 1.145. 
Where the decision as proposed by complainant is entered, such decision 
shall become final and effective without further proceedings 35 days 
after the date of service thereof upon the respondent, unless there is 
an appeal to the Judicial Officer by a party to the proceeding pursuant 
to

[[Page 40]]

Sec. 1.145: Provided, however, That no decision shall be final for 
purposes of judicial review except a final decision of the Judicial 
Officer upon appeal.


<R05>
Sec. 1.140  Conferences and procedure.

    (a) Purpose and scope. (1) Upon motion of a party or upon the 
Judge's own motion, the Judge may direct the parties or their counsel to 
attend a conference at any reasonable time, prior to or during the 
course of the hearing, when the Judge finds that the proceeding would be 
expedited by a conference. Reasonable notice of the time, place, and 
manner of the conference shall be given. The Judge may order each of the 
parties to furnish at or subsequent to the conference any or all of the 
following:
    (i) An outline of the case or defense;
    (ii) The legal theories upon which the party will rely;
    (iii) Copies of or a list of documents which the party anticipates 
introducing at the hearing; and
    (iv) A list of anticipated witnesses who will testify on behalf of 
the party. At the discretion of the party furnishing such list of 
witnesses, the names of the witnesses need not be furnished if they are 
otherwise identified in some meaningful way such as a short statement of 
the type of evidence they will offer.
    (2) The Judge shall not order any of the foregoing procedures that a 
party can show is inappropriate or unwarranted under the circumstances 
of the particular case.
    (3) At the conference, the following matters shall be considered:
    (i) The simplification of issues;
    (ii) The necessity of amendments to pleadings;
    (iii) The possibility of obtaining stipulations of facts and of the 
authenticity, accuracy, and admissibility of documents, which will avoid 
unnecessary proof;
    (iv) The limitation of the number of expert or other witnesses;
    (v) Negotiation, compromise, or settlement of issues;
    (vi) The exchange of copies of proposed exhibits;
    (vii) The identification of documents or matters of which official 
notice may be requested;
    (viii) A schedule to be followed by the parties for completion of 
the actions decided at the conference; and
    (ix) Such other matters as may expedite and aid in the disposition 
of the proceeding.
    (b) Reporting. A conference will not be stenographically reported 
unless so directed by the Judge.
    (c) Manner of Conference. (1) The conference shall be conducted by 
telephone or correspondence unless the Judge determines that conducting 
the conference by audio-visual telecommunication:
    (i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;
    (ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected 
to participate in the conference; or
    (iii) Would cost less than conducting the conference by telephone or 
correspondence. If the Judge determines that a conference conducted by 
audio-visual telecommunication would measurably increase the United 
States Department of Agriculture's cost of conducting the conference, 
the conference shall be conducted by personal attendance of any 
individual who is expected to participate in the conference, by 
telephone, or by correspondence.
    (2) If the conference is not conducted by telephone or 
correspondence, the conference shall be conducted by audio-visual 
telecommunication unless the Judge determines that conducting the 
conference by personal attendance of any individual who is expected to 
participate in the conference:
    (i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;
    (ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected 
to participate in the conference; or
    (iii) Would cost less than conducting the conference by audio-visual 
telecommunication.
    (d) Order. Actions taken as a result of a conference shall be 
reduced to a written appropriate order, unless the Judge concludes that 
a stenographic report shall suffice, or, if the conference takes place 
within 7 days of the beginning of the hearing, the Judge elects to make 
a statement on the record at the hearing summarizing the actions taken.
    (e) Related matters. Upon motion of a respondent, the Judge may 
order the

[[Page 41]]

attorney for the complainant to produce and permit the respondent to 
inspect and copy or photograph any relevant written or recorded 
statements or confessions made by such respondent within the possession, 
custody or control of the complainant.

[42 FR 743, Jan. 4, 1977, as amended at 60 FR 8455, Feb. 14, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1.141  Procedure for hearing.

    (a) Request for hearing. Any party may request a hearing on the 
facts by including such request in the complaint or answer, or by a 
separate request, in writing, filed with the Hearing Clerk within the 
time in which an answer may be filed. A petition for review shall be 
deemed a request for a hearing. Failure to request a hearing within the 
time allowed for the filing of the answer shall constitute a waiver of 
such hearing. Waiver of hearing shall not be deemed to be a waiver of 
the right to request oral argument before the Judicial Officer upon 
appeal of the Judge's decision. In the event the respondent denies any 
material fact and fails to file a timely request for a hearing, the 
matter may be set down for hearing on motion of the complainant or upon 
the Judge's own motion.
    (b) Time, place, and manner. (1) If any material issue of fact is 
joined by the pleadings, the Judge, upon motion of any party stating 
that the matter is at issue and is ready for hearing, shall set a time, 
place, and manner for hearing as soon as feasible after the motion is 
filed, with due regard for the public interest and the convenience and 
necessity of the parties. The Judge shall file with the Hearing Clerk a 
notice stating the time and place of the hearing.\3\ This notice shall 
state whether the hearing will be conducted by telephone, audio-visual 
telecommunication, or personal attendance of any individual expected to 
participate in the hearing. The Judge's determination regarding the 
manner of the hearing shall be made in accordance with paragraphs (b)(3) 
and (b)(4) of this section. If any change in the time, place, or manner 
of the hearing is made, the Judge shall file with the Hearing Clerk a 
notice of such change, which notice shall be served upon the parties, 
unless it is made during the course of an oral hearing and made part of 
the transcript or recording, or actual notice is given to the parties.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The place of hearing in a proceeding under the Packers and 
Stockyards Act shall be set in accordance with the Packers and 
Stockyards Act (7 U.S.C. 228(e) and (f)). In essence, if there is only 
one respondent, the hearing is to be held as near as possible to the 
respondent's place of business or residence depending on the 
availability of an appropriate location for conducting the hearing. If 
there is more than one respondent and they have their places of business 
or residence within a single unit of local government, a single 
geographical area within a State, or a single State, the hearing is to 
be held as near as possible to their places of business or residence 
depending on the availability of an appropriate location for conducting 
the hearing. If there is more than one respondent, and they have their 
places of business or residence distant from each other, 7 U.S.C. 228(e) 
and (f) have no applicability.z
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2)(i) If any material issue of fact is joined by the pleadings and 
the matter is at issue and is ready for hearing, any party may move that 
the hearing be conducted by telephone or personal attendance of any 
individual expected to attend the hearing rather than by audio-visual 
telecommunication. Any motion that the hearing be conducted by telephone 
or personal attendance of any individual expected to attend the hearing 
must be accompanied by a memorandum in support of the motion stating the 
basis for the motion and the circumstances that require the hearing to 
be conducted other than by audio-visual telecommunication.
    (ii) Within 10 days after the Judge issues a notice stating the 
manner in which the hearing is to be conducted, any party may move that 
the Judge reconsider the manner in which the hearing is to be conducted. 
Any motion for reconsideration must be accompanied by a memorandum in 
support of the motion stating the basis for the motion and the 
circumstances that require the hearing to be conducted other than in 
accordance with the Judges's notice.
    (3) The hearing shall be conducted by audio-visual telecommunication 
unless the Judge determines that conducting the hearing by personal 
attendance of

[[Page 42]]

any individual who is expected to participate in the hearing:
    (i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;
    (ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected 
to participate in the hearing; or
    (iii) Would cost less than conducting the hearing by audio-visual 
telecommunication. If the Judge determines that a hearing conducted by 
audio-visual telecommunication would measurably increase the United 
States Department of Agriculture's cost of conducting the hearing, the 
hearing shall be conducted by personal attendance of any individual who 
is expected to participate in the hearing or by telephone.
    (4) The Judge may, in his or her sole discretion or in response to a 
motion by a party to the proceeding, conduct the hearing by telephone if 
the Judge finds that a hearing conducted by telephone:
    (i) Would provide a full and fair evidentiary hearing;
    (ii) Would not prejudice any party; and
    (iii) Would cost less than conducting the hearing by audio-visual 
telecommunication or personal attendance of any individual who is 
expected to participate in the hearing.
    (c) Appearances. The parties may appear in person or by attorney of 
record in the proceeding. Any person who appears as attorney must 
conform to the standards of ethical conduct required of practitioners 
before the courts of the United States.
    (d) Debarment of attorney. (1) Whenever a Judge finds that a person 
acting as attorney for any party to the proceeding is guilty of 
unethical or contumacious conduct, in or in connection with a proceeding 
, the Judge may order that such person be precluded from further acting 
as attorney in the proceeding. An appeal to the Judicial Officer may be 
taken from any such order, but no proceeding shall be delayed or 
suspended pending disposition of the appeal: Provided, That the Judge 
shall suspend the proceeding for a reasonable time for the purpose of 
enabling the party to obtain another attorney.
    (2) Whenever it is found, after notice and opportunity for hearing, 
that a person, who is acting or has acted as attorney for another person 
in any proceeding before the United States Department of Agriculture, is 
unfit to act as such counsel because of such unethical or contumacious 
conduct, such person will be precluded from acting as counsel in any or 
all proceedings before the Department as found to be appropriate.
    (e) Failure to appear. (1) A respondent who, after being duly 
notified, fails to appear at the hearing without good cause, shall be 
deemed to have waived the right to an oral hearing in the proceeding and 
to have admitted any facts which may be presented at the hearing. Such 
failure by the respondent shall also constitute an admission of all the 
material allegations of fact contained in the complaint. Complainant 
shall have an election whether to follow the procedure set forth in 
Sec. 1.139 or whether to present evidence, in whole or in part, in the 
form of affidavits or by oral testimony before the Judge. Failure to 
appear at a hearing shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the right to 
be served with a copy of the Judge's decision and to appeal and request 
oral argument before the Judicial Officer with respect thereto in the 
manner provided in Sec. 1.145.
    (2) If the petitioner in the case of a Petition for Review of a 
determination of responsibly connected status within the meaning of 7 
U.S.C. 499a(9), having been duly notified, fails to appear at the 
hearing without good cause, such petitioner shall be deemed to have 
waived his right to a hearing and to have voluntarily withdrawn his 
petition for review.
    (f) Order of proceeding. Except as may be determined otherwise by 
the Judge, the complainant shall proceed first at the hearing.
    (g) Written statements of direct testimony. (1) Except as provided 
in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, each party must exchange with all 
other parties a written narrative verified statement of the oral direct 
testimony that the party will provide at any hearing to be conducted by 
telephone; the direct testimony of each employee or agent of the party 
that the party will call to

[[Page 43]]

provide oral direct testimony at any hearing to be conducted by 
telephone; and the direct testimony of each expert witness that the 
party will call to provide oral direct testimony at any hearing to be 
conducted by telephone. The written direct testimony of witnesses shall 
be exchanged by the parties at least 10 days prior to the hearing. The 
oral direct testimony provided by a witness at a hearing conducted by 
telephone will be limited to the presentation of the written direct 
testimony, unless the Judge finds that oral direct testimony which is 
supplemental to the written direct testimony would further the public 
interest and would not constitute surprise.
    (2) The parties shall not be required to exchange testimony in 
accordance with this paragraph if the hearing is scheduled to begin less 
than 20 days after the Judge's notice stating the time of the hearing.
    (h) Evidence--(1) In general. (i) The testimony of witnesses at a 
hearing shall be on oath or affirmation and subject to cross-
examination.
    (ii) Upon a finding of good cause, the Judge may order that any 
witness be examined separately and apart from all other witnesses except 
those who may be parties to the proceeding.
    (iii) After a witness called by the complainant has testified on 
direct examination, any other party may request and obtain the 
production of any statement, or part thereof, of such witness in the 
possession of the complainant which relates to the subject matter as to 
which the witness has testified. Such production shall be made according 
to the procedures and subject to the definitions and limitations 
prescribed in the Jencks Act (18 U.S.C. 3500).
    (iv) Evidence which is immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly 
repetitious, or which is not of the sort upon which responsible persons 
are accustomed to rely, shall be excluded insofar as practicable.
    (2) Objections. (i) If a party objects to the admission of any 
evidence or to the limitation of the scope of any examination or cross-
examination or to any other ruling of the Judge, the party shall state 
briefly the grounds of such objection, whereupon an automatic exception 
will follow if the objection is overruled by the Judge.
    (ii) Only objections made before the Judge may subsequently be 
relied upon in the proceeding.
    (3) Depositions. The deposition of any witness shall be admitted in 
the manner provided in and subject to the provisions of Sec. 1.148.
    (4) Exhibits. Unless the Judge finds that the furnishing of copies 
is impracticable, four copies of each exhibit shall be filed with the 
Judge: Provided, That, where there are more than two parties in the 
proceeding, an additional copy shall be filed for each additional party. 
A true copy of an exhibit may be substituted for the original.
    (5) Official records or documents. An official government record or 
document or entry therein, if admissible for any purpose, shall be 
admissible in evidence without the production of the person who made or 
prepared the same, and shall be prima facie evidence of the relevant 
facts stated therein. Such record or document shall be evidenced by an 
official publication thereof or by a copy certified by a person having 
legal authority to make such certification.
    (6) Official notice. Official notice shall be taken of such matters 
as are judicially noticed by the courts of the United States and of any 
other matter of technical, scientific, or commercial fact of established 
character: Provided, That the parties shall be given adequate notice of 
matters so noticed, and shall be given adequate opportunity to show that 
such facts are erroneously noticed.
    (7) Offer of proof. Whenever evidence is excluded by the Judge, the 
party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall be 
included in the transcript or recording. The offer of proof shall 
consist of a brief statement describing the evidence excluded. If the 
evidence consists of a brief oral statement, it shall be included in the 
transcript or recording in toto. If the evidence consists of an exhibit, 
it shall be marked for identification and inserted in the hearing 
record. In either event, the evidence shall be considered a part of the 
transcript or recording and hearing record if the Judicial Officer, upon 
appeal, decides the

[[Page 44]]

Judge's ruling excluding the evidence was erroneous and prejudicial. If 
the Judicial Officer decides the Judge's ruling excluding the evidence 
was erroneous and prejudicial and that it would be inappropriate to have 
such evidence considered a part of the hearing record, the Judicial 
Officer may direct that the hearing be reopened to permit the taking of 
such evidence or for any other purpose in connection with the excluded 
evidence.
    (i) Transcript or recording. (1) Hearings to be conducted by 
telephone shall be recorded verbatim by electronic recording device. 
Hearings conducted by audio-visual telecommunication or the personal 
attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the 
hearing shall be transcribed, unless the Judge finds that recording the 
hearing verbatim would expedite the proceeding and the Judge orders the 
hearing to be recorded verbatim. The Judge shall certify that to the 
best of his or her knowledge and belief any recording made pursuant to 
this paragraph with exhibits that were accepted into evidence is the 
record of the hearing.
    (2) If a hearing is recorded verbatim, a party requests the 
transcript of a hearing or part of a hearing, and the Judge determines 
that the disposition of the proceeding would be expedited by a 
transcript of the hearing or part of a hearing, the Judge shall order 
the verbatim transcription of the recording as requested by the party.
    (3) Recordings or transcripts of hearings shall be made available to 
any person at actual cost of duplication.

<R05>
Sec. 1.142  Post-hearing procedure.

    (a) Corrections to transcript or recording. (1) Within the period of 
time fixed by the Judge, any party may file a motion proposing 
corrections to the transcript or recording.
    (2) Unless a party files such a motion in the manner prescribed, the 
transcript or recording shall be presumed, except for obvious 
typographical errors, to be a true, correct, and complete transcript or 
recording of the testimony given at the hearing and to contain an 
accurate description or reference to all exhibits received in evidence 
and made part of the hearing record, and shall be deemed to be certified 
without further action by the Judge.
    (3) As soon as practicable after the close of the hearing and after 
consideration of any timely objections filed as to the transcript or 
recording, the Judge shall issue an order making any corrections to the 
transcript or recording which the Judge finds are warranted, which 
corrections shall be entered onto the original transcript or recording 
by the Hearing Clerk (without obscuring the original text).
    (b) Proposed findings of fact, conclusions, orders, and briefs. 
Prior to the Judge's decision, each party shall be afforded a reasonable 
opportunity to submit for consideration proposed findings of fact, 
conclusions, order, and brief in support thereof. A copy of each such 
document filed by a party shall be served upon each of the other 
parties.
    (c) Judge's decision. (1) The Judge may, upon motion of any party or 
in his or her own discretion, issue a decision orally at the close of 
the hearing, or within a reasonable time after the closing of the 
hearing.
    (2) If the decision is announced orally, a copy thereof, excerpted 
from the transcript or recording, shall be furnished to the parties by 
the Hearing Clerk. Irrespective of the date such copy is mailed, the 
issuance date of the decision shall be the date the oral decision was 
announced.
    (3) If the decision is in writing, it shall be filed with the 
Hearing Clerk and served upon the parties as provided in Sec. 1.147.
    (4) The Judge's decision shall become effective without further 
proceedings 35 days after the issuance of the decision, if announced 
orally at the hearing, or if the decision is in writing, 35 days after 
the date of service thereof upon the respondent, unless there is an 
appeal to the Judicial Officer by a party to the proceeding pursuant to 
Sec. 1.145; Provided, however, that no decision shall be final for 
purposes of judicial review except a final decision of the Judicial 
Officer upon appeal.

Sec. 1.145  Appeal to Judicial Officer.

    (a) Filing of petition. Within 30 days after receiving service of 
the Judge's decision, a party who disagrees with the decision, or any 
part thereof, or any ruling by the Judge or any alleged deprivation of 
rights, may appeal such decision to the Judicial Officer by filing an 
appeal petition with the Hearing Clerk. As provided in Sec. 1.141(h)(2), 
objections regarding evidence or a limitation regarding examination or 
cross-examination or other ruling made before the Judge may be relied 
upon in an appeal. Each issue set forth in the petition, and the 
arguments thereon, shall be separately numbered; shall be plainly and 
concisely stated; and shall contain detailed citations of the record, 
statutes, regulations or authorities being relied upon in support 
thereof. A brief may be filed in support of the appeal simultaneously 
with the petition.
    (b) Response to appeal petition. Within 20 days after the service of 
a copy of an appeal petition and any brief in support thereof, filed by 
a party to the proceeding, any other party may file with the Hearing 
Clerk a response in support of or in opposition to the appeal and in 
such response any relevant issue, not presented in the appeal petition, 
may be raised.
    (c) Transmittal of record. Whenever an appeal of a Judge's decision 
is filed and a response thereto has been filed or time for filing a 
response has expired, the Hearing Clerk shall transmit to the Judicial 
Officer the record of the proceeding. Such record shall include: the 
pleadings; motions and requests filed and rulings thereon; the 
transcript or recording of the testimony taken at the hearing, together 
with the exhibits filed in connection therewith; any documents or papers 
filed in connection with a prehearing conference; such proposed findings 
of fact, conclusions, and orders, and briefs in support thereof, as may 
have been filed in connection with the proceeding; the Judge's decision; 
such exceptions, statements of objections and briefs in support thereof 
as may have been filed in the proceeding; and the appeal petition, and 
such briefs in support thereof and responses thereto as may have been 
filed in the proceeding.
    (d) Oral argument. A party bringing an appeal may request, within 
the prescribed time for filing such appeal, an opportunity for oral 
argument before the Judicial Officer. Within the time allowed for filing 
a response, appellee may file a request in writing for opportunity for 
such an oral argument. Failure to make such request in writing, within 
the prescribed time period, shall be deemed a waiver of oral argument. 
The Judicial Officer may grant, refuse, or limit any request for oral 
argument. Oral argument shall not be transcribed unless so ordered in 
advance by the Judicial Officer for good cause shown upon request of a 
party or upon the Judicial Officer's own motion.
    (e) Scope of argument. Argument to be heard on appeal, whether oral 
or on brief, shall be limited to the issues raised in the appeal or in 
the response to the appeal, except that if the Judicial Officer 
determines that additional issues should be argued, the parties shall be 
given reasonable notice of such determination, so as to permit 
preparation of adequate arguments on all issues to be argued.

[[Page 47]]

    (f) Notice of argument; postponement. The Hearing Clerk shall advise 
all parties of the time and place at which oral argument will be heard. 
A request for postponement of the argument must be made by motion filed 
a reasonable amount of time in advance of the date fixed for argument.
    (g) Order of argument. The appellant is entitled to open and 
conclude the argument.
    (h) Submission on briefs. By agreement of the parties, an appeal may 
be submitted for decision on the briefs, but the Judicial Officer may 
direct that the appeal be argued orally.
    (i) Decision of the judicial officer on appeal. As soon as 
practicable after the receipt of the record from the Hearing Clerk, or, 
in case oral argument was had, as soon as practicable thereafter, the 
Judicial Officer, upon the basis of and after due consideration of the 
record and any matter of which official notice is taken, shall rule on 
the appeal. If the Judicial Officer decides that no change or 
modification of the Judge's decision is warranted, the Judicial Officer 
may adopt the Judge's decision as the final order in the proceeding, 
preserving any right of the party bringing the appeal to seek judicial 
review of such decision in the proper forum. A final order issued by the 
Judicial Officer shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk. Such order may 
be regarded by the respondent as final for purposes of judicial review 
without filing a petition for rehearing, reargument, or reconsideration 
of the decision of the Judicial Officer.

Sec. 1.146  Petitions for reopening hearing; for rehearing or reargument of proceeding; or for reconsideration of the decision of the Judicial Officer.

    (a) Petition requisite--(1) Filing; service; ruling. A petition for 
reopening the hearing to take further evidence, or for rehearing or 
reargument of the proceeding, or for reconsideration of the decision of 
the Judicial Officer, must be made by petition filed with the Hearing 
Clerk. Every such petition must state specifically the grounds relied 
upon. Any such petition filed prior to the filing of an appeal of the 
Judge's decision pursuant to Sec. 1.145 shall be ruled upon by the 
Judge, and any such petition filed thereafter shall be ruled upon by the 
Judicial Officer.
    (2) Petition to reopen hearing. A petition to reopen a hearing to 
take further evidence may be filed at any time prior to the issuance of 
the decision of the Judicial Officer. Every such petition shall state 
briefly the nature and purpose of the evidence to be adduced, shall show 
that such evidence is not merely cumulative, and shall set forth a good 
reason why such evidence was not adduced at the hearing.
    (3) Petition to rehear or reargue proceeding, or to reconsider the 
decision of the Judicial Officer. A petition to rehear or reargue the 
proceeding or to reconsider the decision of the Judicial Officer shall 
be filed within 10 days after the date of service of such decision upon 
the party filing the petition. Every petition must state specifically 
the matters claimed to have been erroneously decided and alleged errors 
must be briefly stated.
    (b) Procedure for disposition of petitions. Within 20 days following 
the service of any petition provided for in this section, any party to 
the proceeding may file with the Hearing Clerk a reply thereto. As soon 
as practicable thereafter, the Judge or the Judicial Officer, as the 
case may be, shall announce the determination whether to grant or deny 
the petition. The decision of the Judicial Officer shall automatically 
be stayed pending the determination to grant or deny a timely petition. 
Such decision shall not be final for purposes of judicial review until 
the petition is denied or the decision is affirmed or modified pursuant 
to the petition and the time for judicial review shall begin to run upon 
the filing of such final action on the petition. In the event that any 
such petition is granted, the applicable rules of practice, as set out 
elsewhere herein, shall be followed. A person filing a petition under 
this section shall be regarded as the moving party, although such person 
shall be referred to as the complainant or respondent, depending upon 
the designation in the original proceeding.

Sec. 1.148  Depositions.

    (a) Motion for taking deposition. Upon the motion of a party to the 
proceeding, the Judge may, at any time after the filing of the 
complaint, order the taking of testimony by deposition. The Motion shall 
be in writing, shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk, and shall set 
forth:
    (1) The name and address of the proposed deponent;
    (2) The name and address of the person (referred to hereafter in 
this section as the ``officer'') qualified under the regulations in this 
part to take depositions, before whom the proposed examination is to be 
made;
    (3) The proposed time and place of the examination, which shall be 
at leat 15 days after the date of the mailing of the motion; and
    (4) The reasons why such deposition should be taken, which shall be 
solely for the purpose of eliciting testimony which otherwise might not 
be available at the time of hearing, for uses as provided in paragraph 
(g) of this section.
    (b) Judge's order for taking deposition. (1) If the Judge finds that 
the testimony may not be otherwise available at the hearing, the taking 
of the deposition may be ordered. The order shall be filed with the 
Hearing Clerk and shall state:
    (i) The time of the deposition;
    (ii) The place of the deposition;
    (iii) The manner of the deposition (telephone, audio-visual 
telecommunication, or personal attendance of those who are to 
participate in the deposition);
    (iv) The name of the officer before whom the deposition is to be 
made; and
    (v) The name of the deponent. The officer and the time, place, and 
manner need not be the same as those suggested in the motion for the 
deposition.
    (2) The deposition shall be conducted by telephone unless the Judge 
determines that conducting the deposition by audio-visual 
telecommunication:
    (i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;
    (ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected 
to participate in the deposition; or
    (iii) Would cost less than conducting the deposition by telephone. 
If the Judge determines that a deposition

[[Page 50]]

conducted by audio-visual telecommunication would measurably increase 
the United States Department of Agriculture's cost of conducting the 
deposition, the deposition shall be conducted by personal attendance of 
any individual who is expected to participate in the deposition or by 
telephone.
    (3) If the deposition is not conducted by telephone, the deposition 
shall be conducted by audio-visual telecommunication unless the Judge 
determines that conducting the deposition by personal attendance of any 
individual who is expected to participate in the deposition:
    (i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;
    (ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected 
to participate in the deposition; or
    (iii) Would cost less than conducting the deposition by telephone or 
audio-visual telecommunication.
    (c) Qualifications of officer. The deposition shall be made before 
the Judge or before an officer authorized by the law of the United 
States or by the law of the place of the examination to administer 
oaths, or before an officer authorized by the Secretary to administer 
oaths.
    (d) Procedure on examination. (1) The deponent shall be examined 
under oath or affirmation and shall be subject to cross-examination. 
Objections to questions or documents shall be in short form, stating the 
grounds of objections relied upon. The questions proponded, together 
with all objections made (but not including argument or debate), shall 
be recorded verbatim. In lieu of oral examination, parties may transmit 
written questions to the officer prior to the examination and the 
officer shall propound such questions to the deponent.
    (2) The applicant shall arrange for the examination of the witness 
either by oral examination, or by written questions upon agreement of 
the parties or as directed by the Judge. If the examination is conducted 
by means of written questions, copies of the applicant's questions must 
be received by the other party to the proceeding and the officer at 
least 10 days prior to the date set for the examination unless otherwise 
agreed, and any cross questions of a party other than the applicant must 
be received by the applicant and the officer at any time prior to the 
time of the examination.
    (e) Certification by officer. The officer shall certify on the 
deposition that the deponent was duly sworn and that the deposition is a 
true record of the deponent's testimony. The officer shall then securely 
seal the deposition, together with one copy thereof (unless there are 
more than two parties in the proceeding, in which case there should be 
another copy for each additional party), in an envelope and mail the 
same by registered or certified mail to the Hearing Clerk.
    (f) Corrections to the transcript or recording. (1) At any time 
prior to the hearing, any party may file a motion proposing corrections 
to the transcript or recording of the deposition.
    (2) Unless a party files such a motion in the manner prescribed, the 
transcript or recording shall be presumed, except for obvious 
typographical errors, to be a true, correct, and complete transcript or 
recording of the testimony given in the deposition proceeding and to 
contain an accurate description or reference to all exhibits in 
connection therewith, and shall be deemed to be certified correct 
without further procedure.
    (3) At any time prior to use of the deposition in accordance with 
paragraph (g) of this section and after consideration of any objections 
filed thereto, the Judge may issue an order making any corrections in 
the transcript or recording which the Judge finds are warranted, which 
corrections shall be entered onto the original transcript or recording 
by the Hearing Clerk (without obscuring the original text).
    (g) Use of deposition. A deposition ordered and taken in accordance 
with the provisions of this section may be used in a proceeding under 
these rules if the Judge finds that the evidence is otherwise admissible 
and (1) that the witness is dead; (2) that the witness is unable to 
attend or testify because of age, sickness, infirmity, or imprisonment; 
(3) that the party offering the deposition has endeavored to procure the 
attendance of the witness by subpoena, but has been unable to do so; or 
(4) that such exceptional circumstances exist

[[Page 51]]

as to make it desirable, in the interests of justice, to allow the 
deposition to be used. If the party upon whose motion the deposition was 
taken refuses to offer it in evidence, any other party may offer the 
deposition or any part thereof in evidence. If only part of a deposition 
is offered in evidence by a party, an adverse party may require the 
introduction of any other part which ought in fairness to be considered 
with the part introduced, and any party may introduce any other parts.

necessity thereof; and with respect to subpoenas for the production of 
documents, the request shall also show their competency, relevancy, and 
materiality. All requests for subpoenas shall be in writing, unless

requests for subpoenas shall be received by the Judge at least 10 days 
prior to the date set for the hearing.

<R05>
Sec. 1.151  Ex parte communications.

    (a) At no stage of the proceeding between its institution and the 
issuance of the final decision shall the Judge or Judicial Officer 
discuss ex parte the merits of the proceeding with any person who is 
connected with the proceeding in an advocative or in an investigative 
capacity, or with any representative of such person: Provided, That 
procedural matters shall not be included within this limitation; and 
Provided further, That the Judge or Judicial Officer may discuss the

or their attorneys have been given notice and an opportunity to 
participate. A memorandum of any such discussion shall be included in 
the record.
    (b) No interested person shall make or knowingly cause to be made to 
the Judge or Judicial Officer an ex parte communication relevant to the 
merits of the proceeding.

and
    (3) All written responses, and memoranda stating the substance of 
all oral responses thereto.
    (d) Upon receipt of a communication knowingly made or knowingly 
caused to be made by a party in violation of this section, the Judge or 
Judicial Officer may, to the extent consistent with the interests of 
justice and the policy of the underlying statute, require the party to 
show cause why his claim or interest in the proceeding should not be 
dismissed, denied, disregarded, or otherwise adversely affected on 
account of such violation.

[[Page 52]]

    (e) To the extent consistent with the interests of justice and the 
policy of the underlying statute, a violation of this section shall be 
sufficient grounds for a decision adverse to the party who knowingly 
commits a violation of this section or who knowingly causes such a 
violation to occur.
    (f) For purposes of this section ex parte communication means an 
oral or written communication not on the public record with respect to 
which reasonable prior notice to all parties is not given, but it shall 
not include requests for status reports on any matter or the proceeding.

Sec. 1.162  Institution of proceedings.

    (a) Filing of information. Any person having information that any 
agricultural association, as defined in the Capper-Volstead Act, is 
engaged in any practice which monopolizes or restrains trade in 
interstate or foreign commerce to such an extent that the price of any 
agricultural product is unduly enhanced by reason thereof, may submit

and shall contain a complete

[[Page 53]]

statement of facts detailing the price enhancement and the practices 
alleged.
    (b) Consideration of information. The Secretary shall consider all 
information filed under paragraph (a) of this section, and any other 
information which the Secretary may obtain relating to a violation of 
section 2 of the Act. If the Secretary finds that there is reason to 
believe that any association monopolizes or restrains trade in 
interstate or foreign commerce to such an extent that the price of any 
agricultural product is unduly enhanced thereby the Secretary shall 
cause a complaint to be filed, requiring the association to show cause 
why an order should not be made directing the association to cease and 
desist from such monopolization or restraint of trade. The complaint 
shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk, who shall assign to the 
proceeding a docket number and effect service upon respondent.

respondent shall file with the Hearing Clerk, an answer, signed by the 
respondent or the respondent's attorney. The answer shall be served upon 
the complainant by the Hearing Clerk.
    (b) Contents. The answer shall clearly admit, deny, or offer an 
explanation in response to each of the allegations of the complaint, and 
shall clearly set forth any affirmative defense.
    (c) Default. Failure to file an answer shall constitute an admission 
of the allegations in the complaint, and may be the basis for a decision 
upon the presentation of a prima facie case by the complainant.

[45 FR 6587, Jan. 29, 1980, as amended at 60 FR 8457, Feb. 14, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1.165  Amendments.

    Amendments to the complaint may be made prior to the filing of an 
answer in which case the time for filing the answer shall be extended 20 
days or for other time agreed to by the parties. After the answer is 
filed, amendments to the complaint, or to the answer or other pleading, 
may be made by agreement of the parties or allowed at the discretion of 
the Judge. In case of an amendment which significantly changes the 
issues, the hearing shall, on the request of a party, be postponed or 
adjourned for a reasonable period, if the Judge determines that such 
action is necessary to avoid prejudice to the party.


<R05>
Sec. 1.166  Consent order.

<R05>
Sec. 1.167  Conference

    (a) Purpose. Upon motion of a party or upon the Judge's own motion, 
the Judge may direct the parties to attend a conference when the Judge 
finds that the proceeding would be expedited by discussions on matters 
of procedure and/or possible stipulations. The conference may include 
discussions regarding:
    (1) Simplification of the issues;
    (2) Limitation of expert or other witnesses;
    (3) The orderly presentation of evidence; and
    (4) Any other matters that may expedite and aid in the disposition 
of the proceeding.
    (b) Manner of the Conference. (1) The conference shall be conducted 
by telephone or correspondence unless the Judge determines that 
conducting the conference by audio-visual telecommunication:
    (i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;
    (ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected 
to participate in the conference; or

[[Page 54]]

    (iii) Would cost less than conducting the conference by telephone or 
correspondence. If the Judge determines that a conference conducted by 
audio-visual telecommunication would measurably increase the United 
States Department of Agriculture's cost of conducting the conference, 
the conference shall be conducted by personal attendance of any 
individual who is expected to participate in the conference, by 
telephone, or by correspondence.
    (2) If the conference is not conducted by telephone or 
correspondence, the conference shall be conducted by audio-visual 
telecommunication unless the Judge determines that conducting the 
conference by personal attendance of any individual who is expected to 
participate in the conference:
    (i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;
    (ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected 
to participate in the conference; or
    (iii) Would cost less than conducting the conference by audio-visual 
telecommunication.

[60 FR 8457, Feb. 14, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1.168  Procedure for hearing.

    (a) Time and place. The oral hearing shall be held at such time and 
place as specified in the complaint, and not less than 30 days after 
service thereof. The time and place of the hearing may be changed for 
good cause, by the Judge, upon motion of either complainant or 
respondent.
    (b) Manner of hearing. (1) The Judge shall file with the Hearing 
Clerk a notice stating whether the hearing will be conducted by 
telephone, audio-visual telecommunication, or personal attendance of any 
individual expected to attend the hearing and the Judge's determination 
regarding the manner of hearing shall be made in accordance with 
paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section. If any change in the 
manner of the hearing is made, the Judge shall file with the Hearing 
Clerk a notice of the change, which notice shall be served on the 
parties, unless it is made during the course of an oral hearing and made 
part of the transcript or recording, or actual notice is given to the 
parties.
    (2)(i) Any party may move that the hearing be conducted by telephone 
or personal attendance of any individual expected to attend the hearing 
rather than by audio-visual telecommunication. Any motion that the 
hearing be conducted by telephone or personal attendance of any 
individual expected to attend the hearing must be accompanied by a 
memorandum in support of the motion stating the basis for the motion and 
the circumstances that require the hearing to be conducted other than by 
audio-visual telecommunication.
    (ii) Within 10 days after the Judge issues a notice stating the 
manner in which the hearing is to be conducted, any party may move that 
the Judge reconsider the manner in which the hearing is to be conducted. 
Any motion for reconsideration must be accompanied by a memorandum in 
support of the motion stating the basis for the motion and the 
circumstances that require the hearing to be conducted other than in 
accordance with the Judges's notice.
    (3) The hearing shall be conducted by audio-visual telecommunication 
unless the Judge determines that conducting the hearing by personal 
attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the 
hearing:
    (i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;
    (ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected 
to participate in the hearing; or
    (iii) Would cost less than conducting the hearing by audio-visual 
telecommunication. If the Judge determines that a hearing conducted by 
audio-visual telecommunication would measurably increase the United 
States Department of Agriculture's cost of conducting the hearing, the 
hearing shall be conducted by personal attendance of any individual who 
is expected to participate in the hearing or by telephone.
    (4) The Judge may, in his or her sole discretion or in response to a 
motion by a party to the proceeding, conduct the hearing by telephone if 
the Judge finds that a hearing conducted by telephone:
    (i) Would provide a full and fair evidentiary hearing;

[[Page 55]]

    (ii) Would not prejudice any party; and
    (iii) Would cost less than conducting the hearing by audio-visual 
telecommunication or personal attendance of any individual who is 
expected to participate in the hearing.
    (c) Appearances. The parties may appear in person or by counsel or 
by other representative. Persons who appear as counsel or in a 
representative capacity must conform to the standards of ethical conduct 
required of practitioners before the courts of the United States.
    (d) Order of proceeding. Except as otherwise may be agreed by the 
parties and approved by the Judge, the complainant shall proceed first 
at the hearing.
    (e) Failure to appear. If respondent, after being duly notified, 
fails to appear at the hearing, and no good cause for such failure is 
established, complainant shall present a prime facie case on the matters 
denied in the answer.
    (f) Written statements of direct testimony. (1) Except as provided 
in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, each party must exchange with all 
other parties a written narrative verified statement of the oral direct 
testimony that the party will provide at any hearing to be conducted by 
telephone; the direct testimony of each employee or agent of the party 
that the party will call to provide oral direct testimony at any hearing 
to be conducted by telephone; and the direct testimony of each expert 
witness that the party will call to provide oral direct testimony at any 
hearing to be conducted by telephone. The written direct testimony of 
witnesses shall be exchanged by the parties at least 10 days prior to 
the hearing. The oral direct testimony provided by a witness at a 
hearing conducted by telephone will be limited to the presentation of 
the written direct testimony, unless the Judge finds that oral direct 
testimony which is supplemental to the written direct testimony would 
further the public interest and would not constitute surprise.
    (2) The parties shall not be required to exchange testimony in 
accordance with this paragraph if the hearing is scheduled to begin less 
than 20 days after the Judge's notice stating the time of the hearing.
    (g) Evidence. (1) The testimony of witnesses at the hearing shall be 
upon oath or affirmation, transcribed or recorded verbatim, and subject 
to cross-examination. Evidence which is immaterial, irrelevant, or 
unduly repetitious, or which is not of the sort upon which responsible 
persons are accustomed to rely, shall be excluded insofar as 
practicable.
    (2) Objections. If a party objects to the admission of any evidence 
or to the limitation of the scope of any examination or cross-
examination, the party shall briefly state the grounds of such 
objections, whereupon an automatic exception will follow if the 
objection is overruled by the Judge. The ruling of the Judge on any 
objection shall be part of the transcript or recording. Only objections 
made before the Judge may subsequently be relied upon in the proceeding.
    (3) Official records or documents. An official record or document, 
if admissible for any purpose, shall be admissible in evidence without 
the production of the person who made or prepared the same, and shall be 
prima facie evidence of the relevant facts stated therein. Such record 
or document shall be evidenced by an official publication thereof, or by 
a copy certified by a person having legal authority to make such 
certification.
    (4) Exhibits. Unless the Judge finds that the furnishing of multiple 
copies is impracticable, four copies of each exhibit shall be filed with 
the Judge unless the Judge finds that a greater or lesser number is 
desirable. A true copy of an exhibit may be substituted for the 
original.
    (5) Official notice. Official notice shall be taken of such matters 
as are judicially noticed by the courts of the United States and of any 
other matter of technical, scientific, or commercial fact of established 
character: Provided, That the opposing party shall be given adequate 
opportunity to show that such facts are erroneously noticed.
    (6) Offer of proof. Whenever evidence is deleted from the record, 
the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall 
be included in the transcript or recording. The

[[Page 56]]

offer of proof shall consist of a brief statement describing the 
evidence excluded. If the evidence consists of a brief oral statement or 
of an exhibit, it shall be inserted into the transcript or recording in 
toto. In such event, it shall be considered a part of the transcript or 
recording and record if the Judicial Officer decides that the Judge's 
ruling in excluding the evidence was erroneous and prejudicial. The 
Judge shall not allow the insertion of such excluded evidence in toto if 
the taking of such evidence will consume considerable time at the 
hearing. In the latter event, if the Judicial Officer decides that the 
Judge's ruling excluding the evidence was both prejudicial and 
erroneous, the hearing may be reopened to permit the taking of such 
evidence.
    (7) Affidavits. Affidavits may be submitted into evidence, in lieu 
of witness testimony, only to the extent, and in the manner agreed upon 
by the parties.
    (h) Transcript or recording. (1) Hearings to be conducted by 
telephone shall be recorded verbatim by electronic recording device. 
Hearings conducted by audio-visual telecommunication or the personal 
attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the 
hearing shall be transcribed, unless the Judge finds that recording the 
hearing verbatim would expedite the proceeding and the Judge orders the 
hearing to be recorded verbatim. The Judge shall certify that to the 
best of his or her knowledge and belief any recording made pursuant to 
this paragraph with exhibits that were accepted into evidence is the 
record of the hearing.
    (2) If a hearing is recorded verbatim, a party requests the 
transcript of a hearing or part of a hearing, and the Judge determines 
that the disposition of the proceeding would be expedited by a 
transcript of the hearing or part of a hearing, the Judge shall order 
the verbatim transcription of the recording as requested by the party.
    (3) Recordings or transcripts of hearings shall be made available to 
any person at actual cost of duplication.

later than the time fixed for filing proposed findings of fact, 
conclusions and order, or briefs, as the case may be, any party may file 
a motion proposing corrections to the transcript or recording.
    (2) Unless a party files such a motion in the manner prescribed, the

typographical errors, to be a true, correct, and complete transcript or 
recording of the testimony given at the hearing and to contain an 
accurate description or reference to all exhibits received in evidence 
and made part of the hearing record.
    (3) At any time prior to the filing of the Judge's decision and

recording, the Judge may issue an order making any corrections in the 
transcript or recording which the Judge finds are warranted, which 
corrections shall be entered onto the original transcript or recording 
by the Hearing Clerk (without obscurring the original text).
    (b) Proposed findings of fact, conclusions, order and briefs. The 
parties may file with the Hearing Clerk proposed findings of fact, 
conclusions and orders based solely upon the record and on matters 
subject to official notice, and briefs in support thereof. The Judge 
shall announce at the hearing a definite period of time within which 
these documents may be filed.
    (c) Judge's decision. The Judge, within a reasonable time after the 
termination of the period allowed for the filing of proposed findings of 
fact, conclusions and order, and briefs in support thereof, shall 
prepare, upon the basis of the record and matters officially noticed, 
and shall file with the Hearing Clerk, the Judge's decision, a copy of 
which shall be served by the Hearing Clerk upon each of the parties. 
Such decision shall become final and effective without further 
proceedings 35 days after the date of service thereof upon the 
respondent, unless there is an appeal to the Judicial Officer by a party 
to the proceeding pursuant to Sec. 1.170: Provided, That no decision 
shall

[[Page 57]]

be final for purposes of a request for Judicial Review, as provided in 
Sec. 1.175(a), except a final decision of the Judicial Officer on 
appeal.

<R05>
Sec. 1.170  Appeal to the Judicial Officer.

    (a) Filing of petition. Within 30 days after receiving service of 
the Judge's decision, a party who disagrees with the decision, or any 
part thereof, or any ruling by the Judge or any alleged deprivation of 
rights, may appeal such decision to the Judicial Officer by filing an 
appeal petition with the Hearing Clerk. As provided in Sec. 1.168(g)(2), 
objections regarding evidence or a limitation regarding examination or 
cross-examination or other ruling made before the Judge may be relied 
upon in an appeal. Each issue set forth in the petition, and the 
arguments thereon, shall be separately numbered; shall be plainly and 
concisely stated; and shall contain detailed citations to the record, 
statutes, regulations or authorities being relied upon in support 
thereof. A brief may be filed in support of the appeal simultaneously 
with the petition.
    (b) Response to appeal petition. Within 20 days after the service of 
a copy of an appeal petition and any brief in support thereof, filed by 
a party to the proceeding, any other party may file with the Hearing 
Clerk a response in support of or in opposition to the appeal and in 
such response any relevant issue, not presented in the appeal petition, 
may be raised.
    (c) Transmittal of record. Whenever an appeal of a Judge's decision 
is filed and a response thereto has been filed or time for filing a 
response has expired, the Hearing Clerk shall transmit to the Judicial 
Officer the record of the proceeding. Such record shall include: the 
pleadings; motions and requests filed and rulings thereon; the 
transcript or recording of the testimony taken at the hearing, together 
with the exhibits filed in connection therewith; any documents or papers 
filed in connection with a prehearing conference; such proposed findings 
of fact, conclusions, and orders, and briefs in support thereof, as may 
have been filed in connection with the proceeding; the Judge's decision; 
such exceptions, statements of objections and briefs in support thereof 
as may have been filed in the proceeding; and the appeal petition, and 
such briefs in support thereof and responses thereto as may have been 
filed in the proceeding.
    (d) Oral argument. A party bringing an appeal may request, within 
the prescribed time for filing such appeal, an opportunity for oral 
arguments before the Judicial Officer. Within the time allowed for 
filing a response, appellee may file a request in writing for 
opportunity for such an oral argument. Failure to make such request in 
writing, within the prescribed time period, shall be deemed a waiver of 
oral argument. The Judicial Officer may grant, refuse, or limit any 
request for oral argument. Oral argument shall not be transcribed unless 
so ordered in advance by the Judicial Officer for good cause shown upon 
request of a party or upon the Judicial Officer's own motion.
    (e) Scope of argument. Argument to be heard on appeal, whether oral 
or on brief, shall be limited to the issues raised in the appeal or in 
the response to the appeal, except that if the Judicial Officer 
determines that additional issues should be argued, the parties shall be 
given reasonable notice of such determination, so as to permit 
preparation of adequate arguments on all issues to be argued.
    (f) Notice of argument; Postponement. The Hearing Clerk shall advise 
all parties of the time and place at which oral argument will be heard. 
A request for postponement of the argument must be made by motion filed 
a reasonable amount of time in advance of the date fixed for argument.
    (g) Order of argument. The appellant is entitled to open and 
conclude the argument.
    (h) Submission on briefs. By agreement of the parties, an appeal may 
be submitted for decision on the briefs, but the Judicial Officer may 
direct that the appeal be argued orally.
    (i) Decision of the judicial officer on appeal. As soon as 
practicable after the receipt of the record from the Hearing Clerk, or, 
in case oral argument was had, as soon as practicable thereafter, the 
Judicial Officer, upon the basis of and after due consideration of the 
record and any matter of which official

[[Page 58]]

notice is taken, shall rule on the appeal. If the Judicial Officer 
decides that no change or modification of the Judge's decision is 
warranted, the Judicial Officer may adopt the Judge's decision as the 
final order in the proceeding, preserving any right of the party 
bringing the appeal to seek judicial review of such decision in the 
proper forum. A final order issued by the Judicial Officer shall be 
filed with the Hearing Clerk. Such order may be regarded by the 
respondent as final for purposes of a request for judicial review as 
provided in Sec. 1.175(a).

<R05>
Sec. 1.180  Definitions.

Governing Formal Adjudicatory Proceedings (Sec. 1.132 of this part) are 
incorporated into and made applicable to this subpart.

Sec. 1.181  Purpose of these rules.

    The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (called the Act in 
this subpart), provides for the award of attorney fees and other 
expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain 
administrative proceedings (called adversary adjudications) before the 
Department. An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over 
the Department unless the position of the Department was substantially 
justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in 
this subpart describe the parties eligible for awards and the 
proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, 
and the procedures and standards that this Department will use to make 
awards.


<R05>
Sec. 1.182  When the Act applies.

    The Act applies to any adversary adjudication pending or commenced 
before this Department on or after August 5, 1985, except with respect 
to a proceeding covered under Sec. 1.183(a)(1)(iii) of this part, which 
shall be effective on or after October 21, 1986. It also applies to any 
adversary adjudication commenced on or after October 1, 1984, and 
disposed of finally before August 5, 1985, provided that an application 
for fees and expenses, as described in subpart B of these rules, has 
been filed with the agency within 30 days after August 5, 1985, and to 
any adversary adjudication pending on or commenced on or after October 
1, 1981, in which an application for fees and other expenses was timely 
filed and was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.


<R05>
Sec. 1.183  Proceedings covered.

    (a)(1) These rules apply to adversary adjudications. These are:
    (i) Adjudications required by statute to be conducted by this 
Department under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of this Department 
or any other agency of the United States, or any component of an agency, 
is presented by an attorney or other representative who enters an 
appearance and participates in the proceeding,
    (ii) Appeals of decisions of contracting officers made pursuant to 
section 6 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 605) before 
the Agriculture Board of Contract Appeals as provided in section 8 of 
that Act (41 U.S.C. 607), and
    (iii) Any hearing conducted under chapter 38 of title 31, United 
States Code.
    (2) Any proceeding in which this Department may prescribe a lawful 
present or future rate is not covered by the Act. Proceedings to grant 
or renew licenses also are excluded, but proceedings to modify, suspend, 
or revoke licenses are covered if they are otherwise ``adversary 
adjudications.'' The proceedings covered are adversary adjudications 
under the statutory provisions listed below.

    (b) The failure of this Department to identify a type of proceeding 
as an adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filing of an 
application by a party who believes the proceeding is covered by the 
Act; whether the proceeding is covered will then be an issue for 
resolution in proceedings on the application.
    (c) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and 
matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include 
only fees and expenses related to covered issues.


<R05>
Sec. 1.184  Eligibility of applicants.

    (a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses 
under the Act, the applicant must be a prevailing party to the adversary 
adjudication for which it seeks an award. The term party is defined in 5 
U.S.C. 551(3). The applicant must show that it meets all conditions of 
eligiblity set out in Secs. 1.181 through 1.186 and in Secs. 1.190 
through 1.193 of this subpart.
    (b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:
    (1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;
    (2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth 
of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business 
interests, and not more than 500 employees;
    (3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in 
section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) 
with not more than 500 employees;
    (4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the 
Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with not more than 500 
employees; and
    (5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, unit of local 
government, or organization with a net worth of not more than $7 million 
and not more than 500 employees.
    (c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of 
employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the 
proceeding was initiated: Provided, that for purposes of eligibility in 
proceedings covered by Sec. 1.183(a)(1)(ii) of this part, the net worth 
and number of employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the 
date the applicant filed its appeal under 41 U.S.C. 606.
    (d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be 
considered as an ``individual'' rather than a ``sole owner of an 
unincorporated business'' if the issues on which the applicant prevails 
are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business 
interests.
    (e) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly 
perform services for renumeration for the applicant, under the 
applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included 
on a proportional basis.
    (f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all 
of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any 
individual, corporation, or other entity that directly or indirectly 
controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of 
the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant 
directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares 
or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this 
subpart, unless the adjudicative officer determines such treatment would 
be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the actual 
relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the 
adjudicative officer may determine that financial relationships of the 
applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute 
special circumstances that would make an award unjust.
    (g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on 
behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible 
is not itself eligible for an award.

[[Page 63]]


<R05>
Sec. 1.185  Standards for awards.

    (a) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and 
expenses incurred in connection with a proceeding, or in a significant 
and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, unless the position 
of the Department was substantially justified. The position of the 
Department includes, in addition to the position taken by the Department 
in the adversary adjudication, the action or failure to act by the 
Department upon which the adversary adjudication is based. The burden of 
proof that an award should not be made to an eligible prevailing 
applicant because the position of the Department was substantially 
justified is on the agency counsel.
    (b) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly 
or unreasonably protracted the proceeding or if special circumstances 
make the award sought unjust.


<R05>
Sec. 1.186  Allowable fees and expenses.

    (a) Awards will be based on rates customarily charged by persons 
engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents, and expert 
witnesses, even if the services were made available without charge or at 
reduced rate to the applicant.
    (b) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under these rules 
may exceed $75.00 per hour. No award to compensate an expert witness may 
exceed the highest rate at which the Department pays expert witnesses, 
which is set out at Sec. 1.150 of this part. However, an award also may 
include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent, or witness as a 
separate item, if the attorney, agent, or witness ordinarily charges 
clients separately for such expenses.
    (c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an 
attorney, agent, or expert witness, the adjudicative officer shall 
consider the following:
    (1) If the attorney, agent or witness is in private practice, his or 
her customary fee for similar services, or if an employee of the 
applicant, the fully allocated cost of the services;
    (2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in 
which the attorney, agent, or witness ordinarily performs services;
    (3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;
    (4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or 
complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and
    (5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services 
provided.
    (d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, 
test, project or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be 
awarded, to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed 
the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter 
was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.


<R05>
Sec. 1.187  Rulemaking on maximum rates for attorney fees.

    (a) If warranted by an increase in the cost of living or by special 
circumstances (such as limited availability of attorneys qualified to 
handle certain types of proceedings), this Department may adopt 
regulations providing that attorney fees may be awarded at a rate higher 
than $75 per hour in some or all of the types of proceedings covered by 
this part. The Department will conduct any rulemaking proceedings for 
this purpose under the informal rulemaking procedures of the 
Administrative Procedure Act.
    (b) Any person may file with this Department a petition for 
rulemaking to increase the maximum rate for attorney fees in accordance 
with Sec. 1.28 of this part. The petition should identify the rate the 
petitioner believes the Department should establish and the types of 
proceedings in which the rate should be used. It also should explain 
fully the reasons why the higher rate is warranted. The Department will 
respond to the petition within 60 days after it is filed, by initiating 
a rulemaking proceeding, denying the petition, or taking other 
appropriate action.


<R05>
Sec. 1.188  Awards against other agencies.

    If an applicant is entitled to an award because it prevails over 
another agency of the United States that participates in a proceeding 
before the Department and takes a position that is not substantially 
justified, the award

[[Page 64]]

or an appropriate portion of the award shall be made against that 
agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1.189  Delegations of authority.

    The Secretary of Agriculture delegates to the Judicial Officer 
authority to take final action on matters pertaining to the Act in 
proceedings covered by these rules. The Secretary by order may delegate 
authority to take final action on matters pertaining to the Act in 
particular cases to other subordinate officials or bodies. With respect 
to proceedings covered under Sec. 1.183(a)(1)(ii) of this part, the 
Board of Contract Appeals is authorized by statute (41 U.S.C. 607) to 
take final action.

                  Information Required From Applicants


<R05>
Sec. 1.190  Contents of application.

    (a) An application for an award of fees and expenses under the Act 
shall identify the applicant and the proceeding for which an award is 
sought. The application shall show that the applicant has prevailed and 
identify the position of this Department that the applicant alleges was 
not substantially justified and shall briefly state the basis for such 
allegation. Unless the applicant is an individual, the application also 
shall state the number of employees of the applicant and describe 
briefly the type and purpose of its organization or business.
    (b) The application also shall include a statement that the 
applicant's net worth does not exceed $2 million (if an individual) or 
$7 million (for all other applicants, including their affiliates). 
However, an applicant may omit this statement if:
    (1) It attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service 
that it qualifies as an organizatiion described in section 501(c)(3) of 
the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) or, in the case of a 
tax-exempt organization not required to obtain a ruling from the 
Internal Revenue Service on its exempt status, a statement that 
describes the basis for the applicant's belief that it qualifies under 
such section; or
    (2) It states that it is a cooperative association as defined in 
section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 114j(a)).
    (c) The application shall state the amount of fees and expenses for 
which an award is sought.
    (d) The application also may include any other matters that the 
applicant wishes this Department to consider in determining whether, and 
in what amount, an award should be made.
    (e) The application shall be signed by the applicant or an 
authorized officer or attorney of the applicant. It also shall contain 
or be accompanied by a written verification under oath or affirmation 
under penalty of perjury that the information provided in the 
application and all accompanying material is true and complete to the 
best of the signer's information and belief.


<R05>
Sec. 1.191  Net worth exhibit.

    (a) An applicant, except a qualified tax-exempt organization or 
cooperative association, must provide with its application a detailed 
exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as 
defined in Sec. 1.184 of this part) when the proceeding was initiated. 
The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides 
full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' assets and 
liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the applicant 
qualifies under the standards in this subpart. The adjudicative officer 
may require an applicant to file additional information to determine its 
eligibility for an award.
    (b) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public 
record of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public 
disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes 
there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit 
that portion of the exhibit directly to the adjudicative officer in a 
sealed envelope labeled ``Confidential Financial Information,'' 
accompanied by a motion to withhold the information from public 
disclosure. The motion shall describe the information sought to be 
withheld and explain, in detail, why it falls within one or more of the 
specific exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of 
Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1) through (9). The material in 
question shall be served on counsel representing the agency against 
which the applicant

[[Page 65]]

seeks an award, but need not be sereved on any other party to the 
proceeding. If the adjudicative officer finds that the information 
should not be withheld from disclosure, it shall be placed in the public 
record of the proceeding. Otherwise, any request to inspect or copy the 
exhibit shall be disposed of in accordance with the established 
procedures of this Department under the Freedom of Information Act 
(Secs. 1.1 through 1.23 of this part).


<R05>
Sec. 1.192  Documentation of fees and expenses.

    (a) The application shall be accompanied by full documentation of 
the fees and expenses, including the cost of any study, analysis, 
engineering report, test, project, or similar matter, for which an award 
is sought.
    (b) The documentation shall include an affidavit from any attorney, 
agent, or expert witness representing or appearing in behalf of the 
party, stating the actual time expended and the rate at which fees and 
other expenses were computed and describing the specific services 
performed.
    (1) The affidavit shall state the services performed. In order to 
establish the hourly rate, the affidavit shall state the hourly rate 
which is billed and paid by the majority of clients during the relevant 
time periods.
    (2) If no hourly rate is paid by the majority of clients because, 
for instance, the attorney or agent represents most clients on a 
contingency basis, the attorney or agent shall provide information about 
two attorneys or agents with similar experience, who perform similar 
work, stating their hourly rate.
    (c) The documentation also shall include a description of any 
expenses for which reimbursement is sought and a statement of the 
amounts paid and payable by the applicant or by any other person or 
entity for the services provided.
    (d) The adjudicative officer may require the applicant to provide 
vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation for any fees or expenses 
claimed, pursuant to Sec. 1.199 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1.193  Time for filing application.

    (a) An application may be filed whenever the applicant has prevailed 
in the proceeding or in a significant and discrete substantive portion 
of the proceeding, but in no case later than 30 days after final 
disposition of the proceeding by the Department.
    (b) For the purposes of this rule, final disposition means the date 
on which a decision or order disposing of the merits of the proceeding 
or any other complete resolution of the proceeding, such as a settlement 
or voluntary dismissal, become final and unappealable, both within the 
Department and to the courts.
    (c) If review or reconsideration is sought or taken of a decision as 
to which an applicant believes it has prevailed, proceedings for the 
award of fees shall be stayed pending final disposition of the 
underlying controversy. When the United States appeals the underlying 
merits of an adversary adjudication to a court, no decision on an 
application for fees and other expenses in connection with that 
adversary adjudication shall be made until a final and unreviewable 
decision is rendered by the court on the appeal or until the underlying 
merits of the case have been finally determined pursuant to the appeal.

                 Procedures for Considering Applications


<R05>
Sec. 1.194  Filing and service of documents.

    Any application for an award or other pleading or document related 
to an application shall be filed and served on all parties to the 
proceeding in the same manner as other pleadings in the proceeding 
except as provided in Sec. 1.191 of this part for confidential financial 
information. The provisions relating to filing, service, extensions of 
time, and computation of time contained in Sec. 1.147 of this part are 
incorporated into and made applicable to this subpart, except that the 
statutory 30 day time limit on filing the application as set out in 
Sec. 1.193 of this part may not be extended.

[[Page 66]]


<R05>
Sec. 1.195  Answer to application.

    (a) Within 30 days after service of an application, agency counsel 
may file an answer. If agency counsel fails to timely answer or settle 
the application, the adjudicative officer, upon a satisfactory showing 
of entitlement by the applicant, may make an award for the applicant's 
allowable fees and expenses.
    (b) If agency counsel and the applicant believe that the issues in 
the fee application can be settled, they may jointly file a statement of 
intent to negotiate a settlement. The filing of this statement shall 
extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 days, and 
further extensions may be granted by the adjudicative officer upon 
request by agency counsel and the applicant.
    (c) The answer shall explain in detail any objections to the award 
requested and identify the facts relied on in support of agency 
counsel's position. If the answer is based on any alleged facts not 
already in the record of the proceeding, agency counsel shall include 
with the answer either supporting affidavits or a request for further 
proceedings under Sec. 1.199 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1.196  Reply.

    Within 15 days after service of an answer, the applicant may file a 
reply. If the reply is based on any alleged facts not already in the 
record of the proceeding, the applicant shall include with the reply 
either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under 
Sec. 1.199 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1.197  Comments by other parties.

    Any party to a proceeding other than the applicant and agency 
counsel may file comments on an application within 30 days after it is 
served or on an answer within 15 days after it is served. A commenting 
party may not participate further in proceedings on the application, 
unless the adjudicative officer determines that the public interest 
requires such participation in order to permit full exploration of 
matters raised in the comments.


<R05>
Sec. 1.198  Settlement.

    The applicant and agency counsel may agree on a proposed settlement 
of the award before final action on the application, either in 
connection with a settlement of the underlying proceeding, or after the 
underlying proceeding has been concluded. If a prevailing party and 
agency counsel agree on a proposed settlement of an award before an 
application has been filed, the application shall be filed with the 
proposed settlement.


<R05>
Sec. 1.199  Further proceedings.

    (a) Ordinarily, the determination of an award will be made on the 
basis of the written record. However, on request of either the applicant 
or agency counsel, or on his or her own initiative, the adjudicative 
officer may order further proceedings, such as an informal conference, 
oral argument, additional written submissions or, as to issues other 
than substantial justification (such as the applicant's eligibility or 
substantiation of fees and expenses), pertinent discovery or an 
evidentiary hearing. Such further proceedings shall be held only when 
necessary for full and fair resolution of the issues arising from the 
application, and shall be conducted as promptly as possible. Whether the 
position of the Department was substantially justified shall be 
determined on the basis of the administrative record, as a whole, which 
is made in the adversary adjudication for which fees and other expenses 
are sought.
    (b) A request that the adjudicative officer order further 
proceedings under this section shall identify specifically the 
information sought or the disputed issues, and shall explain

proceedings on the application. Whenever possible, the decision shall be 
made by the same administrative judge or panel that decided the contract 
appeal for which fees are sought. The decision shall include written 
findings and conclusions on the applicant's eligibility and status as a 
prevailing party, and an explanation of the reasons for any difference 
between the amount requested and the amount awarded. This decision also 
shall include, if at issue, findings on whether the position of the 
Department was substantially justified, whether the applicant unduly 
protracted the proceedings, or whether special circumstances make an 
award unjust. If the applicant has sought an award against more than one 
agency, the decision shall allocate responsibility for payment of any 
award made among the agencies, and shall explain the reasons for the 
allocation made.


<R05>
Sec. 1.201  Department review.

    (a) Except with respect to a proceeding covered by

counsel may seek review of the initial decision on the fee application, 
in accordance with the provisions of Secs. 1.145(a) and 1.146(a) of this 
part. If neither the applicant nor agency counsel seeks review, the 
initial decision on the fee application shall become a final decision of 
the Department 35 days after it is served upon the applicant. If review 
is taken, it will be in accord with the provisions of Secs. 1.145(b) 
through (i) and 1.146(b) of this part.
    (b) With respect to a proceeding covered by Sec. 1.183(a)(1)(ii) of

Appeals contained in Sec. 24.21 of this title. In addition, either party

provided in 5 U.S.C. 504(c)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 1.203  Payment of award.

    An applicant seeking payment of an award shall submit to the head of 
the agency administering the statute involved in the proceeding a copy 
of the final decision of the Department granting the award, accompanied 
by a statement that the applicant will not seek review of the decision 
in the United States courts. The agency will pay the amount awarded to 
the applicant within 60 days, unless judicial review of the award or of 
the underlying decision of the adversary adjudication has been sought by 
the applicant or any other party to the proceeding.

of a party other than the United States in a judicial or administrative

agency, with the concurrence of the General Counsel, based upon a 
determination that such an appearance is in the interest of USDA.
    (2) An employee of USDA requested to appear as a witness on behalf

interference with the duties of the USDA employee;

of improperly favoring one litigant over another.
    (2) The considerations listed in paragraph (e)(1) of this section 
are illustrative and not exhaustive.

<R05>
Sec. 1.335  Determining the amount of penalties and assessments.

    (a) In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and 
assessments, the ALJ and the judicial officer, upon appeal, should 
evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation and 
should articulate in their opinions the reasons that support the 
penalties and assessments they impose. Because of the intangible costs 
of fraud, the expense of investigating such conduct, and the need to 
deter others who might be similarly tempted, ordinarily double damages 
and a significant civil penalty should be imposed.
    (b) Although not exhaustive, the following factors are among those 
that may influence the ALJ and the judicial officer in determining the 
amount of penalties and assessments to impose with respect to the 
misconduct (i.e., the false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or 
statements) charged in the complaint:
    (1) The number of false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or 
statements;
    (2) The time period over which such claims or statements were made;
    (3) The degree of the respondent's culpability with respect to the 
misconduct;
    (4) The amount of money or the value of the property, services, or 
benefit falsely claimed;
    (5) The value of the Government's actual loss as a result of the 
misconduct, including foreseeable consequential damages and the costs of 
investigation;
    (6) The relationship of the amount imposed as civil penalties to the 
amount of the Government's loss;
    (7) The potential or actual impact of the misconduct upon national 
defense, public health or safety, or public confidence in the management 
of Government programs and operations, including particularly the impact 
on the intended beneficiaries of such programs;
    (8) Whether the respondent has engaged in a pattern of the same or 
similar misconduct;
    (9) Whether the respondent attempted to conceal the misconduct;
    (10) The degree to which the respondent has involved others in the 
misconduct or in concealing it;
    (11) Where the misconduct of employees or agents is imputed to the 
respondent, the extent to which the respondent's practices fostered or 
attempted to preclude such misconduct;
    (12) Whether the respondent cooperated in or obstructed an 
investigation of the misconduct;
    (13) Whether the respondent assisted in identifying and prosecuting 
other wrongdoers;
    (14) The complexity of the program or transaction, and the degree of 
the respondent's sophistication with respect to it, including the extent 
of the respondent's prior participation in the program or in similar 
transactions;
    (15) Whether the respondent has been found, in any criminal, civil, 
or administrative proceeding to have engaged in similar misconduct or to 
have dealt dishonestly with the government of the United States or of a 
State, directly or indirectly; and

[[Page 84]]

    (16) The need to deter the respondent and others from any engaging 
in the same or similar misconduct.
    (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ALJ or 
the judicial officer from considering any other factors that in any 
given case may mitigate or aggravate the acts for which penalties and 
assessments are imposed.

the motion, unless the initial decision is timely appealed to the 
judicial officer in accordance with Sec. 1.338 of this part.
    (g) If the ALJ issues a revised initial decision, that decision 
shall constitute the final decision of the authority head and shall be

of this part.


<R05>

under Sec. 1.337 of this part has expired, the ALJ will forward the 
record of the proceeding to the judicial officer.
    (e) A notice of appeal shall be accompanied by a written brief

failure to raise the objection.
    (j) If any party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the judicial 
officer that additional evidence not presented to the ALJ is material 
and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to present such 
evidence to the ALJ, the judicial officer shall remand the matter to the 
ALJ for consideration of such additional evidence.
    (k) The judicial officer may affirm, reduce, reverse, compromise, 
remand or settle any penalty or assessment determined by the ALJ.

related to such claim or statement, the judicial officer shall stay the

party in the proceeding, may review the comments and request a hearing 
within 10 working days after the comment period, pursuant to 36 CFR 
233.190(h)(2). The request must be postmarked no later than the 10th 
working day of the review period. An attorney may file an appearance of 
record prior to the scheduled hearing. The request for a hearing shall 
be filed with the Judge. The hearing is for the purpose of supplementing 
the written record submitted prior to the hearing. The written record 
submitted prior to the hearing consists of papers and documents 
submitted during the 30 calendar day comment period, the 10 working day 
review period, and any motions submitted before the hearing. For

<R05>
Sec. 1.418  Procedure upon no request for hearing.

    If no hearing is requested by a party of record, the Judge shall 
issue an initial decision based on the written record and without 
further procedure or hearing. If no hearing is requested, the written 
record consists of papers and documents submitted during the 30-day 
comment period, the 10-day review period, and includes motions submitted 
before the Judge issues an initial decision. For purposes of a formal 
review of a sourcing area, the written record also consists of the 
papers and documents submitted during the informal review. Copies of the 
decision shall be served by the Hearing Clerk upon each of the parties 
of record.


<R05>
Sec. 1.419  Amendment of a sourcing area application.

    The sourcing area applicant may move to amend the sourcing area 
application with clarifying and technical amendments at any time prior 
to the Judge's initial determination if there is no hearing, or prior to 
the close of the hearing if there is a hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 1.420  Consent recommendation.

    Any time before the Judge files the decision, the parties of record 
may enter a consent recommendation. Such consent recommendation shall be 
filed with the Hearing Clerk, signed by the parties with appropriate 
space for signature by the Judge. The consent recommendation shall 
contain an admission of the jurisdictional facts, the factual and legal 
basis for the recommended sourcing area, the consent to the issuance of 
the recommended decision as the final decision of the agency without 
further procedure and such other admissions or statements as may be 
recommended by the parties. The Judge shall review the recommendation to 
determine whether such recommendation conforms with the Forest Resources 
Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.), 
36 CFR 223.190, 36 CFR 223.191(e) and these procedures. If the 
recommendation conforms to the aforementioned Act, regulations, and 
procedures, the Judge may enter such decision without further procedure, 
unless an error is apparent on the face of the document. If the Judge 
enters the decision, such decision shall have the same force and effect 
as a decision issued after full hearing and shall become final upon 
issuance to become effective in accordance with the terms of the 
decision.


<R05>
Sec. 1.421  Prehearing conferences and procedures.

    (a) Purpose and scope. (1) Upon motion of a party of record or upon 
the Judge's own motion, the Judge may direct the parties or their 
counsel to attend a conference at any reasonable time, prior to or 
during the course of the hearing, when the Judge finds that the 
proceeding would be expedited by a prehearing conference. Reasonable 
notice of the time and place of the conference shall be given. The Judge 
may order each of the parties to furnish at or subsequent to the 
conference any or all of the following:
    (i) An outline of a party's position;
    (ii) The facts upon which the party will rely;
    (iii) The legal theories upon which the party will rely;
    (iv) Copies of or a list of documents which the party anticipates 
introducing at the hearing; and
    (v) A list of anticipated witnesses who will testify on behalf of 
the party. At the discretion of the party furnishing such list of 
witnesses, the names of the witnesses need not be furnished if they are 
otherwise identified in some meaningful way such as a short statement of 
the type of evidence they will offer.
    (2) The Judge shall not order any of the foregoing procedures that a 
party can show is inappropriate or unwarranted under the circumstances 
of the particular determination.
    (3) At the conference, the following matters shall be considered:
    (i) The simplification of issues;
    (ii) The possibility of obtaining stipulations of facts and of the 
authenticity, accuracy, and admissibility of documents, which will avoid 
unnecessary proof;
    (iii) The limitation of the number of expert or other witnesses;
    (iv) Negotiation, compromise, or settlement of issues;

[[Page 91]]

    (v) The exchange of copies of proposed exhibits;
    (vi) The identification of documents or matters of which official 
notice may be requested;
    (vii) A schedule to be followed by the parties for completion of the 
actions decided at the conference; and
    (viii) Such other matters as may expedite and aid in the disposition 
of the proceeding.
    (b) Reporting. A prehearing conference will not be stenographically 
reported unless so directed by the Judge.
    (c) Action in lieu of personal attendance at a conference. In the 
event the Judge concludes that personal attendance by the Judge and the 
parties or counsel at a prehearing conference is unwarranted or 
impracticable, but determines that a conference would expedite the 
proceeding, the Judge may conduct such conference by telephone or 
correspondence.
    (d) Order. Actions taken as a result of a conference shall be 
reduced to an appropriate written order, unless the Judge concludes that 
a stenographic report shall suffice, or if the Judge elects to make a 
statement on the record at the hearing summarizing the actions taken.

Sec. 1.422  Conduct of the hearing.

    (a) Time and place. The hearing shall be held at the time and place 
fixed in the notice of hearing. If any change in the time or place of

notice of such change, which notice shall be served upon the parties, 
unless it is made during the course of an oral script, or actual notice 
is given to the parties.
    (b) Appearances. The parties may appear in person or by attorney of 
record in the proceeding. Any party who desires to be heard in person 
shall, before proceeding to testify, state his name, address, and 
occupation. If any such person is appearing through counsel, such person 
or such counsel shall, before proceeding to testify or otherwise to 
participate in the hearing, state for the record the authority to act as 
such counsel or representative, and the names, addresses, and 
occupations of such person and such counsel. Any such person or such 
counsel shall give such other information respecting his appearance as 
the Judge may request. Any person who appears as counsel must conform to 
the standards of ethical conduct required of practitioners before the 
courts of the United States.
    (c) Failure to appear. A party of record who, after being duly 
notified, fails to appear at the hearing without good cause, shall be 
deemed to have waived the right to an oral hearing in the proceeding. 
Failure to appear at a hearing shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the 
right to be served with a copy of the Judge's decision.
    (d) Order of proceeding. The Judge shall determine the order in 
which the parties shall proceed.
    (e) Evidence--(1) In general. (i) The testimony of witnesses at a 
hearing shall be on oath or affirmation and shall be subject to cross-

for a full and true disclosure of the facts. The Judge may require that 
testimony on one issue raised by numerous parties be heard at one time.
    (ii) Upon a finding of good cause, the Judge may order that any 
witness be examined separately and apart from all other witnesses except 
those who may be parties to the proceeding.
    (iii) After a witness has testified on direct examination, any other 
party may request and obtain the production of any statement, or part 
thereof, of such witness in the possession of the party who called the 
witness, which relates to the subject matter as to which the witness has 
testified. Such production shall be made according to the procedures and 
subject to the definitions and limitations prescribed in the Jencks Act 
(18 U.S.C. 3500).
    (iv) Evidence which is immaterial, or unduly repetitious, or which 
is not of the sort upon which responsible persons are accustomed to 
rely, shall be excluded insofar as practicable.
    (2) Objections. (i) If a party objects to the admission of any 
evidence or to the limitation of the scope of any examination or cross-
examination or to any other ruling of the Judge, the party shall state 
briefly the grounds of such objection, whereupon an automatic exception 
will follow if the objection is overruled by the Judge.

[[Page 92]]

    (ii) Only objections made before the Judge may subsequently be 
relied upon in the proceeding.
    (3) Depositions. The deposition of any witness shall be admitted in 
the manner provided in and subject to the provisions of Sec. 1.228 of

of record a copy of the exhibit, pursuant to Sec. 1.427(c) of these 
procedures. A true copy of an exhibit may be substituted for the 
original.
    (5) Official records or documents. An official government record or 
document or entry therein, if admissible for any purpose, shall be 
admissible in evidence without the production of the person who made or 
prepared the same, and shall be prima facie evidence of the relevant 
facts stated therein. Such record or document shall be evidenced by an 
official publication thereof or a copy certified by a person having 
legal authority to make such certification.
    (6) Official notice. Official notice shall be taken of such matters 
as are judicially noted by the courts of the United States and of any 
other matter of technical, scientific, or commercial fact of established 
character: Provided, That the parties shall be given adequate notice of 
matters so noticed, and shall be given adequate opportunity to show that 
such facts are erroneously noticed.
    (7) Offer of proof. Whenever evidence is excluded by the Judge, the 
party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall be 
included in the transcript. The offer of proof shall consist of a brief 
statement describing the evidence excluded. If the evidence consists of 
a brief oral statement, it shall be included in the transcript in toto. 
If the evidence consists of an exhibit, it shall be marked for 
identification and inserted in the hearing record.

    (e) Certification by officer. The officer shall certify on the 
deposition that the deponent was duly sworn and that the deposition is a 
true record of the deponent's testimony. The officer shall then securely 
seal the deposition, together with one copy thereof (unless there are 
more than two parties in the proceeding, in which case there should be 
another copy for each additional party), in an envelope and mail the 
same by registered or certified mail to the Hearing Clerk.
    (f) Corrections to the transcript. (1) At any time prior to the 
hearing any party may file a motion proposing corrections to the 
transcript of the deposition.
    (2) Unless a party files such a motion in the manner prescribed, the 
transcript shall be presumed, except for obvious typographical errors, 
to be a true, correct, and complete transcript of the testimony given in 
the deposition proceeding and to contain an accurate description or 
reference to all exhibits in connection therewith, and shall be deemed 
to be certified correct without further procedure.
    (3) At any time prior to use of the deposition in accordance with 
paragraph (g) of this section and after consideration of any objections 
filed thereto, the Judge may issue an order making any corrections in 
the transcript which the Judge finds are warranted, which corrections 
shall be entered onto the original transcript by the Hearing Clerk 
(without obscuring the original text).
    (g) Use of deposition. A deposition ordered and taken in accordance 
with the provisions of this section may be used in a proceeding under 
these rules if the Judge finds that the evidence is otherwise admissible 
and that the witness is dead; that the witness is unable to attend or 
testify because of age, sickness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or that 
such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in the 
interests of justice, to allow the deposition to be used. If the party 
upon whose motion the deposition was taken refuses to offer it in 
evidence, any other party may offer the deposition or any thereof in 
evidence. If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a 
party, an adverse party may require the introduction of any other part 
which ought in fairness to be considered with the part introduced and 
any party may introduce any other parts.


<R05>
Sec. 1.429  Ex parte communications.

    (a) At no stage of the proceeding between its institution and 
issuance of the final decision shall an employee of the Department who 
is or may reasonably be expected to be involved in the decisional 
process of the proceeding discuss ex parte the merits of the proceeding 
with any person having an interest in the proceeding, or with any 
representative of such person: Provided, That, procedural matters and 
status reports shall not be included within this limitation; and 
Provided further, That an employee of the Department who is or may be 
involved in the decisional process of the proceeding may discuss the 
merits of the proceeding if all parties of record have been given notice 
and an opportunity to participate. A memorandum of any such discussion 
shall be included in the record.
    (b) No interested person shall make or knowingly cause to be made to 
the Judge an ex parte communication relevant to the merits of the 
proceeding.

[[Page 97]]

    (c) If the Judge reviews an ex parte communication in violation of 
this section, the one who receives the communication shall place in the 
public record of the proceeding:
    (1) All such written communication;
    (2) Memoranda stating the substance of all such oral communications; 
and
    (3) All written responses, and memoranda stating the substance of 
all oral responses thereto.
    (d) Upon receipt of a communication knowingly made or knowingly 
caused to be made by a party in violation of this section, the Judge 
may, to the extent consistent with the interests of justice and the 
policy of the underlying statute, require the party to show cause why 
his claim or interest in the proceeding should not be dismissed, denied, 
disregarded, or otherwise adversely affected on account of such 
violation.
    (e) To the extent consistent with the interests of justice and the 
policy of the underlying statute, a violation of this section shall be 
sufficient grounds for a decision adverse to the party who knowingly 
commits a violation of this section or who knowingly causes such a 
violation to occur.
    (f) For purposes of this section ``ex parte communication'' means an 
oral or written communication not on the public record with respect to 
which reasonable prior notice to all parties is not given, but it shall 
not include requests for status reports on any matter or the proceeding.

<R05>
Sec. 1c.101  To what does this policy apply?

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this policy 
applies to all research involving human subjects conducted, supported or 
otherwise subject to regulation by any federal department or agency 
which takes appropriate administrative action to make the policy 
applicable to such research. This includes research conducted by federal 
civilian employees or military personnel, except that each department or 
agency head may adopt such procedural modifications as may be 
appropriate from an administrative standpoint. It also includes research 
conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by the federal 
government outside the United States.
    (1) Research that is conducted or supported by a Federal department 
or agency, whether or not it is regulated as defined in Sec. 1c.102(e), 
must comply with all sections of this policy.
    (2) Research that is neither conducted nor supported by a Federal 
department or agency but is subject to regulation as defined in 
Sec. 1c.102(e) must be reviewed and approved, in compliance with 
Sec. 1c.101, Sec. 1c.102, and Sec. 1c.107 through Sec. 1c.117 of this 
policy, by an institutional review board (IRB) that operates in 
accordance with the pertinent requirements of this policy.
    (b) Unless otherwise required by department or agency heads, 
research activities in which the only involvement of human subjects will 
be in one or more of the following categories are exempt from this 
policy:
    (1) Research conducted in established or commonly accepted 
educational settings, involving normal educational practices, such as 
(i) Research on regular and special education instructional strategies, 
or (ii) research on the effectiveness of or the comparison among 
instructional techniques, curricula, or classroom management methods.
    (2) Research involving the use of educational tests (cognitive, 
diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, interview 
procedures or observation of public behavior, unless:
    (i) Information obtained is recorded in such a manner that human 
subjects can be identified, directly or through identifiers linked to 
the subjects; and
    (ii) Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the 
research could reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or 
civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, 
employability, or reputation.
    (3) Research involving the use of educational tests (cognitive, 
diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, interview 
procedures, or observation of public behavior that is not exempt under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if:
    (i) The human subjects are elected or appointed public officials or 
candidates for public office; or
    (ii) Federal statute(s) require(s) without exception that the 
confidentiality of the personally identifiable information will be 
maintained throughout the research and thereafter.
    (4) Research, involving the collection or study of existing data, 
documents, records, pathological specimens, or diagnostic specimens, if 
these sources are publicly available or if the information is recorded 
by the investigator in such a manner that subjects cannot be identified, 
directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects.

[[Page 101]]

    (5) Research and demonstration projects which are conducted by or 
subject to the approval of department or agency heads, and which are 
designed to study, evaluate, or otherwise examine:
    (i) Public benefit or service programs;
    (ii) Procedures for obtaining benefits or services under those 
programs;
    (iii) possible changes in or alternatives to those programs or 
procedures; or
    (iv) Possible changes in methods or levels of payment for benefits 
or services under those programs.
    (6) Taste and food quality evaluation and consumer acceptance 
studies, (i) if wholesome foods without additives are consumed or (ii) 
if a food is consumed that contains a food ingredient at or below the 
level and for a use found to be safe, or agricultural chemical or 
environmental contaminant at or below the level found to be safe, by the 
Food and Drug Administration or approved by the Environmental Protection 
Agency or the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture.
    (c) Department or agency heads retain final judgment as to whether a 
particular activity is covered by this policy.
    (d) Department or agency heads may require that specific research 
activities or classes of research activities conducted, supported, or 
otherwise subject to regulation by the department or agency but not 
otherwise covered by this policy, comply with some or all of the 
requirements of this policy.
    (e) Compliance with this policy requires compliance with pertinent 
federal laws or regulations which provide additional protections for 
human subjects.
    (f) This policy does not affect any state or local laws or 
regulations which may otherwise be applicable and which provide 
additional protections for human subjects.
    (g) This policy does not affect any foreign laws or regulations 
which may otherwise be applicable and which provide additional 
protections to human subjects of research.
    (h) When research covered by this policy takes place in foreign 
countries, procedures normally followed in the foreign countries to 
protect human subjects may differ from those set forth in this policy. 
[An example is a foreign institution which complies with guidelines 
consistent with the World Medical Assembly Declaration (Declaration of 
Helsinki amended 1989) issued either by sovereign states or by an 
organization whose function for the protection of human research 
subjects is internationally recognized.] In these circumstances, if a 
department or agency head determines that the procedures prescribed by 
the institution afford protections that are at least equivalent to those 
provided in this policy, the department or agency head may approve the 
substitution of the foreign procedures in lieu of the procedural 
requirements provided in this policy. Except when otherwise required by 
statute, Executive Order, or the department or agency head, notices of 
these actions as they occur will be published in the Federal Register or 
will be otherwise published as provided in department or agency 
procedures.
    (i) Unless otherwise required by law, department or agency heads may 
waive the applicability of some or all of the provisions of this policy 
to specific research activities or classes of research activities 
otherwise covered by this policy. Except when otherwise required by 
statute or Executive Order, the department or agency head shall forward 
advance notices of these actions to the Office for Protection from 
Research Risks, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and shall 
also publish them in the Federal Register or in such other manner as 
provided in department or agency procedures.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Institutions with HHS-approved assurances on file will abide by 
provisions of title 45 CFR part 46 subparts A-D. Some of the other 
Departments and Agencies have incorporated all provisions of title 45 
CFR part 46 into their policies and procedures as well. However, the 
exemptions at 45 CFR 46.101(b) do not apply to research involving 
prisoners, fetuses, pregnant women, or human in vitro fertilization, 
subparts B and C. The exemption at 45 CFR 46.101(b)(2), for research 
involving survey or interview procedures or observation of public 
behavior, does not apply to research with children, subpart D, except 
for research involving observations of public behavior when the 
investigator(s) do not participate in the activities being observed.

<R05>
Sec. 1c.102  Definitions.

    (a) Department or agency head means the head of any federal 
department or agency and any other officer or employee of any department 
or agency to whom authority has been delegated.
    (b) Institution means any public or private entity or agency 
(including federal, state, and other agencies).
    (c) Legally authorized representative means an individual or 
judicial or other body authorized under applicable law to consent on 
behalf of a prospective subject to the subject's participation in the 
procedure(s) involved in the research.
    (d) Research means a systematic investigation, including research 
development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute 
to generalizable knowledge. Activities which meet this definition 
constitute research for purposes of this policy, whether or not they are 
conducted or supported under a program which is considered research for 
other purposes. For example, some demonstration and service programs may 
include research activities.
    (e) Research subject to regulation, and similar terms are intended 
to encompass those research activities for which a federal department or 
agency has specific responsibility for regulating as a research 
activity, (for example, Investigational New Drug requirements 
administered by the Food and Drug Administration). It does not include 
research activities which are incidentally regulated by a federal 
department or agency solely as part of the department's or agency's 
broader responsibility to regulate certain types of activities whether 
research or non-research in nature (for example, Wage and Hour 
requirements administered by the Department of Labor).
    (f) Human subject means a living individual about whom an 
investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research 
obtains:
    (1) Data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or
    (2) Identifiable private information.

Intervention includes both physical procedures by which data are 
gathered (for example, venipuncture) and manipulations of the subject or 
the subject's environment that are performed for research purposes. 
Interaction includes communication or interpersonal contact between 
investigator and subject. ``Private information'' includes information 
about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can 
reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and 
information which has been provided for specific purposes by an 
individual and which the individual can reasonably expect will not be 
made public (for example, a medical record). Private information must be 
individually identifiable (i.e., the identity of the subject is or may 
readily be ascertained by the investigator or associated with the 
information) in order for obtaining the information to constitute 
research involving human subjects.
    (g) IRB means an institutional review board established in accord 
with and for the purposes expressed in this policy.
    (h) IRB approval means the determination of the IRB that the 
research has been reviewed and may be conducted at an institution within 
the constraints set forth by the IRB and by other institutional and 
federal requirements.
    (i) Minimal risk means that the probability and magnitude of harm or 
discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of 
themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the 
performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.
    (j) Certification means the official notification by the institution 
to the supporting department or agency, in accordance with the 
requirements of this policy, that a research project or activity 
involving human subjects has been reviewed and approved by an IRB in 
accordance with an approved assurance.

[[Page 103]]


<R05>
Sec. 1c.103  Assuring compliance with this policy--research conducted or supported by any Federal Department or Agency.

    (a) Each institution engaged in research which is covered by this 
policy and which is conducted or supported by a federal department or 
agency shall provide written assurance satisfactory to the department or 
agency head that it will comply with the requirements set forth in this 
policy. In lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, individual 
department or agency heads shall accept the existence of a current 
assurance, appropriate for the research in question, on file with the 
Office for Protection from Research Risks, HHS, and approved for 
federalwide use by that office. When the existence of an HHS-approved 
assurance is accepted in lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, 
reports (except certification) required by this policy to be made to 
department and agency heads shall also be made to the Office for 
Protection from Research Risks, HHS.
    (b) Departments and agencies will conduct or support research 
covered by this policy only if the institution has an assurance approved 
as provided in this section, and only if the institution has certified 
to the department or agency head that the research has been reviewed and 
approved by an IRB provided for in the assurance, and will be subject to 
continuing review by the IRB. Assurances applicable to federally 
supported or conducted research shall at a minimum include:
    (1) A statement of principles governing the institution in the 
discharge of its responsibilities for protecting the rights and welfare 
of human subjects of research conducted at or sponsored by the 
institution, regardless of whether the research is subject to federal 
regulation. This may include an appropriate existing code, declaration, 
or statement of ethical principles, or a statement formulated by the 
institution itself. This requirement does not preempt provisions of this 
policy applicable to department- or agency-supported or regulated 
research and need not be applicable to any research exempted or waived 
under Sec. 1c.101 (b) or (i).
    (2) Designation of one or more IRBs established in accordance with 
the requirements of this policy, and for which provisions are made for 
meeting space and sufficient staff to support the IRB's review and 
recordkeeping duties.
    (3) A list of IRB members identified by name; earned degrees; 
representative capacity; indications of experience such as board 
certifications, licenses, etc., sufficient to describe each member's 
chief anticipated contributions to IRB deliberations; and any employment 
or other relationship between each member and the institution; for 
example: full-time employee, part-time employee, member of governing 
panel or board, stockholder, paid or unpaid consultant. Changes in IRB 
membership shall be reported to the department or agency head, unless in 
accord with Sec. 1c.103(a) of this policy, the existence of an HHS-
approved assurance is accepted. In this case, change in IRB membership 
shall be reported to the Office for Protection from Research Risks, HHS.
    (4) Written procedures which the IRB will follow (i) for conducting 
its initial and continuing review of research and for reporting its 
findings and actions to the investigator and the institution; (ii) for 
determining which projects require review more often than annually and 
which projects need verification from sources other than the 
investigators that no material changes have occurred since previous IRB 
review; and (iii) for ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB of proposed 
changes in a research activity, and for ensuring that such changes in 
approved research, during the period for which IRB approval has already 
been given, may not be initiated without IRB review and approval except 
when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject.
    (5) Written procedures for ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB, 
appropriate institutional officials, and the department or agency head 
of (i) any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others 
or any serious or continuing noncompliance with this

[[Page 104]]

policy or the requirements or determinations of the IRB and (ii) any 
suspension or termination of IRB approval.
    (c) The assurance shall be executed by an individual authorized to 
act for the institution and to assume on behalf of the institution the 
obligations imposed by this policy and shall be filed in such form and 
manner as the department or agency head prescribes.
    (d) The department or agency head will evaluate all assurances 
submitted in accordance with this policy through such officers and 
employees of the department or agency and such experts or consultants 
engaged for this purpose as the department or agency head determines to 
be appropriate. The department or agency head's evaluation will take 
into consideration the adequacy of the proposed IRB in light of the 
anticipated scope of the institution's research activities and the types 
of subject populations likely to be involved, the appropriateness of the 
proposed initial and continuing review procedures in light of the 
probable risks, and the size and complexity of the institution.
    (e) On the basis of this evaluation, the department or agency head 
may approve or disapprove the assurance, or enter into negotiations to 
develop an approvable one. The department or agency head may limit the 
period during which any particular approved assurance or class of 
approved assurances shall remain effective or otherwise condition or 
restrict approval.
    (f) Certification is required when the research is supported by a 
federal department or agency and not otherwise exempted or waived under 
Sec. 1c.101 (b) or (i). An institution with an approved assurance shall 
certify that each application or proposal for research covered by the 
assurance and by Sec. 1c.103 of this Policy has been reviewed and 
approved by the IRB. Such certification must be submitted with the 
application or proposal or by such later date as may be prescribed by 
the department or agency to which the application or proposal is 
submitted. Under no condition shall research covered by Sec. 1c.103 of 
the Policy be supported prior to receipt of the certification that the 
research has been reviewed and approved by the IRB. Institutions without 
an approved assurance covering the research shall certify within 30 days 
after receipt of a request for such a certification from the department 
or agency, that the application or proposal has been approved by the 
IRB. If the certification is not submitted within these time limits, the 
application or proposal may be returned to the institution.

Secs. 1c.104-1c.106  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1c.107  IRB membership.

    (a) Each IRB shall have at least five members, with varying 
backgrounds to promote complete and adequate review of research 
activities commonly conducted by the institution. The IRB shall be 
sufficiently qualified through the experience and expertise of its 
members, and the diversity of the members, including consideration of 
race, gender, and cultural backgrounds and sensitivity to such issues as 
community attitudes, to promote respect for its advice and counsel in 
safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects. In addition to 
possessing the professional competence necessary to review specific 
research activities, the IRB shall be able to ascertain the 
acceptability of proposed research in terms of institutional commitments 
and regulations, applicable law, and standards of professional conduct 
and practice. The IRB shall therefore include persons knowledgeable in 
these areas. If an IRB regularly reviews research that involves a 
vulnerable category of subjects, such as children, prisoners, pregnant 
women, or handicapped or mentally disabled persons, consideration shall 
be given to the inclusion of one or more individuals who are 
knowledgeable about and experienced in working with these subjects.
    (b) Every nondiscriminatory effort will be made to ensure that no 
IRB consists entirely of men or entirely of women, including the 
institution's consideration of qualified persons of both sexes, so long 
as no selection is made to the IRB on the basis of gender. No IRB may 
consist entirely of members of one profession.

[[Page 105]]

    (c) Each IRB shall include at least one member whose primary 
concerns are in scientific areas and at least one member whose primary 
concerns are in nonscientific areas.
    (d) Each IRB shall include at least one member who is not otherwise 
affiliated with the institution and who is not part of the immediate 
family of a person who is affiliated with the institution.
    (e) No IRB may have a member participate in the IRB's initial or 
continuing review of any project in which the member has a conflicting 
interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB.
    (f) An IRB may, at its discretion, invite individuals with 
competence in special areas to assist in the review of issues which 
require expertise beyond or in addition to that available on the IRB. 
These individuals may not vote with the IRB.


<R05>
Sec. 1c.108  IRB functions and operations.

    In order to fulfill the requirements of this policy each IRB shall:
    (a) Follow written procedures in the same detail as described in 
Sec. 1c.103(b)(4) and, to the extent required by, Sec. 1c.103(b)(5).
    (b) Except when an expedited review procedure is used (see 
Sec. 1c.110), review proposed research at convened meetings at which a 
majority of the members of the IRB are present, including at least one 
member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas. In order for 
the research to be approved, it shall receive the approval of a majority 
of those members present at the meeting.


<R05>
Sec. 1c.109  IRB review of research.

    (a) An IRB shall review and have authority to approve, require 
modifications in (to secure approval), or disapprove all research 
activities covered by this policy.
    (b) An IRB shall require that information given to subjects as part 
of informed consent is in accordance with Sec. 1c.116. The IRB may 
require that information, in addition to that specifically mentioned in 
Sec. 1c.116, be given to the subjects when in the IRB's judgment the 
information would meaningfully add to the protection of the rights and 
welfare of subjects.
    (c) An IRB shall require documentation of informed consent or may 
waive documentation in accordance with Sec. 1c.117.
    (d) An IRB shall notify investigators and the institution in writing 
of its decision to approve or disapprove the proposed research activity, 
or of modifications required to secure IRB approval of the research 
activity. If the IRB decides to disapprove a research activity, it shall 
include in its written notification a statement of the reasons for its 
decision and give the investigator an opportunity to respond in person 
or in writing.
    (e) An IRB shall conduct continuing review of research covered by 
this policy at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less 
than once per year, and shall have authority to observe or have a third 
party observe the consent process and the research.

9999-0020)


<R05>
Sec. 1c.110  Expedited review procedures for certain kinds of research involving no more than minimal risk, and for minor changes in approved research.

    (a) The Secretary, HHS, has established, and published as a Notice 
in the Federal Register, a list of categories of research that may be 
reviewed by the IRB through an expedited review procedure. The list will 
be amended, as appropriate after consultation with other departments and 
agencies, through periodic republication by the Secretary, HHS, in the 
Federal Register. A copy of the list is available from the Office for 
Protection from Research Risks, National Institutes of Health, HHS, 
Bethesda, Maryland 20892.
    (b) An IRB may use the expedited review procedure to review either 
or both of the following:
    (1) Some or all of the research appearing on the list and found by 
the reviewer(s) to involve no more than minimal risk,
    (2) Minor changes in previously approved research during the period 
(of one year or less) for which approval is authorized.

[[Page 106]]


Under an expedited review procedure, the review may be carried out by 
the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers designated 
by the chairperson from among members of the IRB. In reviewing the 
research, the reviewers may exercise all of the authorities of the IRB 
except that the reviewers may not disapprove the research. A research 
activity may be disapproved only after review in accordance with the 
non-expedited procedure set forth in Sec. 1c.108(b).
    (c) Each IRB which uses an expedited review procedure shall adopt a 
method for keeping all members advised of research proposals which have 
been approved under the procedure.
    (d) The department or agency head may restrict, suspend, terminate, 
or choose not to authorize an institution's or IRB's use of the 
expedited review procedure.


<R05>
Sec. 1c.111  Criteria for IRB approval of research.

    (a) In order to approve research covered by this policy the IRB 
shall determine that all of the following requirements are satisfied:
    (1) Risks to subjects are minimized: (i) By using procedures which 
are consistent with sound research design and which do not unnecessarily 
expose subjects to risk, and (ii) whenever appropriate, by using 
procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or 
treatment purposes.
    (2) Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated 
benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that 
may reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, 
the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result 
from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies 
subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The 
IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying 
knowledge gained in the research (for example, the possible effects of 
the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall 
within the purview of its responsibility.
    (3) Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment 
the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the 
setting in which the research will be conducted and should be 
particularly cognizant of the special problems of research involving 
vulnerable populations, such as children, prisoners, pregnant women, 
mentally disabled persons, or economically or educationally 
disadvantaged persons.
    (4) Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or 
the subject's legally authorized representative, in accordance with, and 
to the extent required by Sec. 1c.116.
    (5) Informed consent will be appropriately documented, in accordance 
with, and to the extent required by Sec. 1c.117.
    (6) When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for 
monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects.
    (7) When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the 
privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.
    (b) When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to 
coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, pregnant 
women, mentally disabled persons, or economically or educationally 
disadvantaged persons, additional safeguards have been included in the 
study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects.


<R05>
Sec. 1c.112  Review by institution.

    Research covered by this policy that has been approved by an IRB may 
be subject to further appropriate review and approval or disapproval by 
officials of the institution. However, those officials may not approve 
the research if it has not been approved by an IRB.


<R05>
Sec. 1c.113  Suspension or termination of IRB approval of research.

    An IRB shall have authority to suspend or terminate approval of 
research that is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's 
requirements or that has been associated with unexpected serious harm to 
subjects. Any suspension or termination of approval shall include a 
statement of the reasons for the IRB's action and shall be reported 
promptly to the investigator,

[[Page 107]]

appropriate institutional officials, and the department or agency head.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
9999-0020)


<R05>
Sec. 1c.114  Cooperative research.

    Cooperative research projects are those projects covered by this 
policy which involve more than one institution. In the conduct of 
cooperative research projects, each institution is responsible for 
safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects and for complying 
with this policy. With the approval of the department or agency head, an 
institution participating in a cooperative project may enter into a 
joint review arrangement, rely upon the review of another qualified IRB, 
or make similar arrangements for avoiding duplication of effort.


<R05>
Sec. 1c.115  IRB records.

    (a) An institution, or when appropriate an IRB, shall prepare and 
maintain adequate documentation of IRB activities, including the 
following:
    (1) Copies of all research proposals reviewed, scientific 
evaluations, if any, that accompany the proposals, approved sample 
consent documents, progress reports submitted by investigators, and 
reports of injuries to subjects.
    (2) Minutes of IRB meetings which shall be in sufficient detail to 
show attendance at the meetings; actions taken by the IRB; the vote on 
these actions including the number of members voting for, against, and 
abstaining; the basis for requiring changes in or disapproving research; 
and a written summary of the discussion of controverted issues and their 
resolution.
    (3) Records of continuing review activities.
    (4) Copies of all correspondence between the IRB and the 
investigators.
    (5) A list of IRB members in the same detail as described is 
Sec. 1c.103(b)(3).
    (6) Written procedures for the IRB in the same detail as described 
in Sec. 1c.103(b)(4) and Sec. 1c.103(b)(5).
    (7) Statements of significant new findings provided to subjects, as 
required by Sec. 1c.116(b)(5).
    (b) The records required by this policy shall be retained for at 
least 3 years, and records relating to research which is conducted shall 
be retained for at least 3 years after completion of the research. All 
records shall be accessible for inspection and copying by authorized 
representatives of the department or agency at reasonable times and in a 
reasonable manner.

<R05>
Sec. 1c.116  General requirements for informed consent.

    Except as provided elsewhere in this policy, no investigator may 
involve a human being as a subject in research covered by this policy 
unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed 
consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized 
representative. An investigator shall seek such consent only under 
circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the representative 
sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and 
that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence. The 
information that is given to the subject or the representative shall be 
in language understandable to the subject or the representative. No 
informed consent, whether oral or written, may include any exculpatory 
language through which the subject or the representative is made to 
waive or appear to waive any of the subject's legal rights, or releases 
or appears to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution or 
its agents from liability for negligence.
    (a) Basic elements of informed consent. Except as provided in 
paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, in seeking informed consent the 
following information shall be provided to each subject:
    (1) A statement that the study involves research, an explanation of 
the purposes of the research and the expected duration of the subject's 
participation, a description of the procedures to be followed, and 
identification of any procedures which are experimental;
    (2) A description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts 
to the subject;
    (3) A description of any benefits to the subject or to others which 
may reasonably be expected from the research;

[[Page 108]]

    (4) A disclosure of appropriate alternative procedures or courses of 
treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject;
    (5) A statement describing the extent, if any, to which 
confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained;
    (6) For research involving more than minimal risk, an explanation as 
to whether any compensation and an explanation as to whether any medical 
treatments are available if injury occurs and, if so, what they consist 
of, or where further information may be obtained;
    (7) An explanation of whom to contact for answers to pertinent 
questions about the research and research subjects' rights, and whom to 
contact in the event of a research-related injury to the subject; and
    (8) A statement that participation is voluntary, refusal to 
participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which the 
subject is otherwise entitled, and the subject may discontinue 
participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which 
the subject is otherwise entitled.
    (b) Additional elements of informed consent. When appropriate, one 
or more of the following elements of information shall also be provided 
to each subject:
    (1) A statement that the particular treatment or procedure may 
involve risks to the subject (or to the embryo or fetus, if the subject 
is or may become pregnant) which are currently unforeseeable;
    (2) Anticipated circumstances under which the subject's 
participation may be terminated by the investigator without regard to 
the subject's consent;
    (3) Any additional costs to the subject that may result from 
participation in the research;
    (4) The consequences of a subject's decision to withdraw from the 
research and procedures for orderly termination of participation by the 
subject;
    (5) A statement that significant new findings developed during the 
course of the research which may relate to the subject's willingness to 
continue participation will be provided to the subject; and
    (6) The approximate number of subjects involved in the study.
    (c) An IRB may approve a consent procedure which does not include, 
or which alters, some or all of the elements of informed consent set 
forth above, or waive the requirement to obtain informed consent 
provided the IRB finds and documents that:
    (1) The research or demonstration project is to be conducted by or 
subject to the approval of state or local government officials and is 
designed to study, evaluate, or otherwise examine: (i) Public benefit of 
service programs; (ii) procedures for obtaining benefits or services 
under those programs; (iii) possible changes in or alternatives to those 
programs or procedures; or (iv) possible changes in methods or levels of 
payment for benefits or services under those programs; and
    (2) The research could not practicably be carried out without the 
waiver or alteration.
    (d) An IRB may approve a consent procedure which does not include, 
or which alters, some or all of the elements of informed consent set 
forth in this section, or waive the requirements to obtain informed 
consent provided the IRB finds and documents that:
    (1) The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects;
    (2) The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights 
and welfare of the subjects;
    (3) The research could not practicably be carried out without the 
waiver or alteration; and
    (4) Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with 
additional pertinent information after participation.
    (e) The informed consent requirements in this policy are not 
intended to preempt any applicable federal, state, or local laws which 
require additional information to be disclosed in order for informed 
consent to be legally effective.
    (f) Nothing in this policy is intended to limit the authority of a 
physician to provide emergency medical care, to the extent the physician 
is permitted to do so under applicable federal, state, or local law.

<R05>
Sec. 1c.117  Documentation of informed consent.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, informed 
consent shall be documented by the use of a written consent form 
approved by the IRB and signed by the subject or the subject's legally 
authorized representative. A copy shall be given to the person signing 
the form.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the consent 
form may be either of the following:
    (1) A written consent document that embodies the elements of 
informed consent required by Sec. 1c.116. This form may be read to the 
subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, but in any 
event, the investigator shall give either the subject or the 
representative adequate opportunity to read it before it is signed; or
    (2) A short form written consent document stating that the elements 
of informed consent required by Sec. 1c.116 have been presented orally 
to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. When 
this method is used, there shall be a witness to the oral presentation. 
Also, the IRB shall approve a written summary of what is to be said to 
the subject or the representative. Only the short form itself is to be 
signed by the subject or the representative. However, the witness shall 
sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and the person 
actually obtaining consent shall sign a copy of the summary. A copy of 
the summary shall be given to the subject or the representative, in 
addition to a copy of the short form.
    (c) An IRB may waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain 
a signed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds either:
    (1) That the only record linking the subject and the research would 
be the consent document and the principal risk would be potential harm 
resulting from a breach of confidentiality. Each subject will be asked 
whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the 
research, and the subject's wishes will govern; or
    (2) That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to 
subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is 
normally required outside of the research context.
    In cases in which the documentation requirement is waived, the IRB 
may require the investigator to provide subjects with a written 
statement regarding the research.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
9999-0020)


<R05>
Sec. 1c.118  Applications and proposals lacking definite plans for involvement of human subjects.

    Certain types of applications for grants, cooperative agreements, or 
contracts are submitted to departments or agencies with the knowledge 
that subjects may be involved within the period of support, but definite 
plans would not normally be set forth in the application or proposal. 
These include activities such as institutional type grants when 
selection of specific projects is the institution's responsibility; 
research training grants in which the activities involving subjects 
remain to be selected; and projects in which human subjects' involvement 
will depend upon completion of instruments, prior animal studies, or 
purification of compounds. These applications need not be reviewed by an 
IRB before an award may be made. However, except for research exempted 
or waived under Sec. 1c.101 (b) or (i), no human subjects may be 
involved in any project supported by these awards until the project has 
been reviewed and approved by the IRB, as provided in this policy, and 
certification submitted, by the institution, to the department or 
agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1c.119  Research undertaken without the intention of involving human subjects.

    In the event research is undertaken without the intention of 
involving human subjects, but it is later proposed to involve human 
subjects in the research, the research shall first be reviewed and 
approved by an IRB, as provided in this policy, a certification 
submitted, by the institution, to the department or agency, and final 
approval given to the proposed change by the department or agency.

[[Page 110]]


<R05>
Sec. 1c.120  Evaluation and disposition of applications and proposals for research to be conducted or supported by a Federal Department or Agency.

    (a) The department or agency head will evaluate all applications and 
proposals involving human subjects submitted to the department or agency 
through such officers and employees of the department or agency and such 
experts and consultants as the department or agency head determines to 
be appropriate. This evaluation will take into consideration the risks 
to the subjects, the adequacy of protection against these risks, the 
potential benefits of the research to the subjects and others, and the 
importance of the knowledge gained or to be gained.
    (b) On the basis of this evaluation, the department or agency head 
may approve or disapprove the application or proposal, or enter into 
negotiations to develop an approvable one.


<R05>
Sec. 1c.121  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1c.122  Use of Federal funds.

    Federal funds administered by a department or agency may not be 
expended for research involving human subjects unless the requirements 
of this policy have been satisfied.


<R05>
Sec. 1c.123  Early termination of research support: Evaluation of applications and proposals.

    (a) The department or agency head may require that department or 
agency support for any project be terminated or suspended in the manner 
prescribed in applicable program requirements, when the department or 
agency head finds an institution has materially failed to comply with 
the terms of this policy.
    (b) In making decisions about supporting or approving applications 
or proposals covered by this policy the department or agency head may 
take into account, in addition to all other eligibility requirements and 
program criteria, factors such as whether the applicant has been subject 
to a termination or suspension under paragarph (a) of this section and 
whether the applicant or the person or persons who would direct or has 
have directed the scientific and technical aspects of an activity has 
have, in the judgment of the department or agency head, materially 
failed to discharge responsibility for the protection of the rights and 
welfare of human subjects (whether or not the research was subject to 
federal regulation).


<R05>
Sec. 1c.124  Conditions.

    With respect to any research project or any class of research 
projects the department or agency head may impose additional conditions 
prior to or at the time of approval when in the judgment of the 
department or agency head additional conditions are necessary for the 
protection of human subjects.

Redesignated at 13 FR 6903, Nov. 24, 1948.


<R05>
Sec. 3.1  Purposes of the act and regulations.

    The principal purposes of the act and of the regulations in this 
part are to provide means of:
    (a) Settling, by compromise, adjustment or cancellation relatively 
small debts long past due and owing to the Government arising from loans 
or payments made under farm programs administered by the Department;
    (b) recovering by the Department of substantial sums which are found 
uncollectible when the indebtednesses are treated as full obligations, 
and which otherwise would probably never be collected;
    (c) clearing the accounts of balances so small as not to warrant 
continued efforts of collection; and
    (d) the clearing of the accounts of the records of indebtedness made 
uncollectible by reason of the death or disappearance of the debtors.

The existence of the act will neither serve as grounds for any 
relaxation in the general collection policy of the Department nor should 
it serve as grounds for any lessening of the efforts of farmers to pay 
their indebtedness.


<R05>
Sec. 3.2  Definitions.

    (a) Department means Department of Agriculture.
    (b) Indebtedness with respect to any person, means a debt to the 
Government under each of the acts and programs listed in Sec. 3.10.
    (c) Compromise means final liquidation of the indebtedness through 
the immediate payment of a portion thereof, and acceptance by the United 
States of such payment in full satisfaction of the indebtedness.
    (d) Adjustment means the scaling down of the amount of the 
indebtedness including interest, conditioned upon the payment of the 
adjusted amount at some specified future time or times; such adjustment 
is not to be considered as effective as a settlement under this act 
until the provisions of the adjustment arrangement have been carried 
out.
    (e) Cancellation means the complete discharge, without payment, of 
the indebtedness and the debtor.

Redesignated at 13 FR 6903, Nov. 24, 1948; 55 FR 38662, Sept. 20, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 3.3  Settlement of indebtedness.

    (a) Indebtedness will be compromised, adjusted, or canceled, upon 
applicability by the debtor except in those cases where it is found that 
it is legally impossible for the debtor to make application, and upon 
the making of all the following findings:
    (1) That said indebtedness has been due and payable for five years 
or more;
    (2) That the debtor is unable to pay said indebtedness in full and 
has no reasonable prospect of being able to do so; officers of the 
Department shall not make such findings on the basis of mere 
unwillingness to pay on the part of the debtor, or mere financial 
disadvantage to him, but should find that the settlement is the most 
advantageous arrangement possible from the standpoint of the Government 
under the findings prescribed in this part. In no event shall 
cancellation be made unless, in addition to the foregoing requirements, 
there is an advantage in

[[Page 253]]

removing the indebtedness from the accounts.
    (3) That the debtor has acted in good faith in an effort to meet his 
obligation; and
    (4) That the principal amount of said indebtedness is not in excess 
of $1,000.
    (b) Indebtedness may also be canceled without application when any 
one of the following circumstances is found:
    (1) The amount of said indebtedness, including interest, is less 
than $10; such efforts of collection have been made as are warranted 
under the circumstances, and the cost of collection or of continued 
maintenance of accounts is deemed greater than the amount of the 
indebtedness;
    (2) The debtor is deceased and there is no reasonable prospect of 
recovering from his estate;
    (3) The debtor's whereabouts has remained unknown for two years and 
there is no reasonable prospect of obtaining collection; heads of 
agencies designated in Sec. 3.5 will prescribe procedures which will 
assure that cancellations on this ground will be made only after a 
diligent effort has been made to locate the debtor, including such 
contact with other agencies of the Department or otherwise as the amount 
of the indebtedness and the circumstances warrant;
    (4) The debtor has been discharged of the indebtedness in any 
proceeding under ``An act to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy 
throughout the United States.''
    (5) It is impossible or impracticable for legal or other reasons to 
obtain the debtor's application but all of the findings required by 
paragraph (a) of this section are made.

<R05>
Sec. 3.4  Investigations and findings.

    The heads of agencies designated in Sec. 3.5 shall prescribe 
procedures for the conduct of investigations to determine the facts 
incident to the settlement of any indebtedness. These procedures should 
include, among other things, provisions for consultations with local 
authorities, businessmen, or local representatives of other Government 
agencies, or for obtaining the recommendations of committees or other 
groups or persons designated by each agency for assistance in its 
regular program, or otherwise. The file relating to each debtor shall 
contain the formal findings required by Sec. 3.3, together with such 
evidence as has been obtained in support of such findings.
    In order to effect uniformity in settlements, agency procedures 
should also provide that, where it appears from the application of the 
debtor or from investigation that the debtor is otherwise indebted to 
the United States, to the extent practicable consultation should be had 
(other than in cases under Sec. 3.3(b)(1) and (4) with any other 
creditor agencies, to ascertain pertinent information as to the status 
of such other obligation or obligations. Such information shall be 
considered in connection with the settlement and for inclusion in the 
findings.
    The head of each agency shall provide for review of proposed 
indebtedness settlements within his agency by officers or employees 
designated for that purpose under such conditions as he shall determine 
to be adequate to insure the protection of the interests of the United 
States.


<R05>
Sec. 3.5  Delegations of authority.

    The heads of any administration or other agency having jurisdiction 
over any of the acts or programs listed in Sec. 3.10 (including those of 
Federal Crop Insurance Corporation) are hereby authorized, within their 
respective jurisdictions, to exercise any or all of the functions 
prescribed by this part. The head of each of such agencies may delegate 
and authorize the redelegation of any of the functions vested in him by 
this part: Provided, That the determination of any settlement shall not

and Conservation State Offices, such authority may also be delegated to 
the State Administrative Officers and except that in the case of the 
Farmers Home Administration, such authority may also be delegated to 
Assistant State Directors and

administration.

<R05>
Sec. 3.6  Forms and records.

    The Office of Management and Budget may prescribe or approve forms 
for applications for settlement of indebtedness under this part; and 
shall require each agency to establish records to insure the immediate 
availability of necessary information of operations under this part. 
Each agency shall furnish to the Office of Management and Budget a 
report of operations under this part quarterly, or for such other 
periods as the Director of Finance may designate.

[21 FR 3213, May 16, 1956, as amended at 55 FR 38662, Sept. 20, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 3.8  Penalties.

    The act prescribes the punishment by a fine of not more than $1,000 
or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both, upon conviction, 
for anyone making any material representation, knowing it to be false, 
for the purpose of influencing in any way the action of the Secretary or 
of any person acting under his authority in connection with any 
compromise, adjustment, or cancellation of indebtedness provided for in 
the act. The act also prohibits the acceptance by any officer, employee, 
or other person to whom is delegated any power or function under the 
act, of any fee, commission, gift, or other consideration, directly or 
indirectly, for or in connection with any transaction or business 
relating to the compromise, adjustment, or cancellation of indebtedness 
under the act.


<R05>
Sec. 3.9  Indebtedness referred to the Comptroller General or the Attorney General.

    No settlement shall be effected under this part if the indebtedness 
is pending before the Comptroller General for compromise, or the 
Attorney General for collection.

CFR 105.4.

Sec. 3.21  Debt collection standards.

    (a) The regulations in this subpart are issued under the Federal 
Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended by the Debt Collection Act of 
1982 (31 U.S.C. 3701, 3711, 3716-3719), and the Joint Regulations issued 
under the Act by the Attorney General and the Comptroller General (4 CFR 
parts 101-105), prescribing Government-wide standards for administrative 
collection, compromise, suspension or termination of agency collection 
action, disclosure of debt information to consumer reporting agencies, 
referral of claims to private collection contractors for resolution, and 
referral to the General Accounting Office and to the Department of 
Justice for litigation of civil claims by the Government for money or 
property.
    (b) The head of each agency of the Department may carry out the 
duties

[[Page 256]]

and exercise the authority of the Secretary under 31 U.S.C. 3701, 3711, 
3716-3719, 3728, the Joint Regulations of the Attorney General and the 
Comptroller General, and the regulations in this part, with respect to 
the claims of the agency. An agency head may adopt regulations, in 
accordance with the Debt Collection Act and the Joint Regulations, 
setting out agency procedures for the collection by administrative 
offset of such claims and debts. If the head of an agency of the 
Department adopts regulations separate from this subpart, the procedures 
thereby established, rather than those set out in this part, shall be 
followed for the collection of the claims and debts to which the 
separate regulations apply. If an agency does not adopt separate 
regulations, the Director of the Office of Finance and Management may 
carry out the duties and exercise the authority of the Secretary on 
behalf of agency heads.
    (c) Except where administrative offset is explicitly prohibited by 
statute or where other procedures are explicitly provided for by 
statute, all contracts and other written agreements which are executed 
after the effective date of these regulations between an agency and any 
person or entity must include the following or substantially similar 
language:

Any monies that are payable or may become payable from the United States 
under this agreement to any person or legal entity not an agency or 
subdivision of a State or local government may be subject to 
administrative offset for the collection of a delinquent debt the person 
or legal entity owes to the United States, under the Federal Claims 
Collection Act of 1966, as amended by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 
(31 U.S.C. 3701, 3711, 3716-3719); 4 CFR part 102 and subpart B of this 
part. Information on the person's or legal entity's responsibility for a 
commercial debt or delinquent consumer debt owed the United States will 
be disclosed to consumer or commercial credit reporting agencies.

<R05>
Sec. 3.22  Definitions.

    In this subpart:
    (a) Debt management officer means an agency employee responsible for 
collection by administrative offset of debts owed the United States.
    (b) Contracting officer has the same meaning as in 41 U.S.C. 601.
    (c) Creditor agency means a Federal agency to whom a debtor owes a 
monetary debt. It need not be the same agency that effects the offset.
    (d) Offsetting agency means an agency that withholds from its 
payment to a debtor an amount owed by the debtor to a creditor agency, 
and assures that the funds are paid to the creditor agency to be applied 
to the debt.
    (e) Reviewing officer means an agency employee responsible for 
conducting a hearing or providing documentary review on the existence of 
the debt and the propriety of administrative offset.

[50 FR 7722, Feb. 26, 1985, as amended at 55 FR 38662, Sept. 20, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 3.23  Collection by administrative offset.

    (a) Whenever feasible, each agency of the Department of Agriculture 
must use, or request any other Federal agency to use, administrative 
offset in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716 and 4 CFR 102.3 to collect 
debts due the United States. The debt need not be reduced to judgment or 
be undisputed.
    (b) The feasibility of collecting a debt by administrative offset 
will be determined on a case-by-case basis considering among other 
factors the following:
    (1) Legal impediments to administrative offset, such as contract 
provisions, or degree of certainty as to the factual basis (other than 
the debt amount) of the Government's claim.
    (2) Practicality, considering such questions as costs in time and 
money of administrative offset relative to the size of the debt.
    (3) Whether offset would substantially interfere with or defeat the 
purposes of a program authorizing payments against which offset is 
contemplated, as where payment is an advance for future performance by 
the debtor of a service the Government desires.
    (4) Whether the agency has substantiated the existence of the debt.

[[Page 257]]

    (c) The offset will be effected 31 days after the debtor receives a 
Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset, or when a stay of 
offset expires, unless the agency determines under Sec. 3.26 that 
immediate action is necessary. If the debtor owes more than one debt, 
amounts recovered through administrative offset may be applied to them 
in any order, with attention to applicable statutes of limitation.
    (d) These procedures will be used to collect any debt subject to 31 
U.S.C. 3716, including contract debts, but not including 
intracontractual claims or intracontractual disputes. A contracting 
officer administering a claim under the Contract Disputes Act (CDA), 41 
U.S.C. 601-613 must promptly refer the claim to the agency debt 
management officer for consideration of administrative offset apart from 
CDA proceedings.
    (e) An agency debt management officer will determine the prima facie 
existence of the debt, the feasibility of administrative offset as a 
means of collection and what monies, if any, are payable or may become 
payable to the debtor. No agency employee may act as debt management 
officer for the consideration of collection by administrative offset in 
a matter for which the employee was a contracting officer.
    (f) An agency reviewing officer will afford debtors review of the 
issue of administrative offset under these rules. No agency employee may 
act as a reviewing officer for the consideration of collection by 
administrative offset in a matter for which the employee was a 
contracting officer or a debt management officer.

[50 FR 7722, Feb. 26, 1985, as amended at 55 FR 38662, Sept. 20, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 3.24  Coordinating administrative offset with other Federal agencies.

    (a) A Government list or other notice, naming debtors and their 
creditor agencies, which is provided to USDA will constitute a request 
for administrative offset.
    (b) Any agency which requests another agency to effect 
administrative offset must certify that the debtor owes the debt 
(including the amount and basis of the debt and the due date of the 
payment) and that all of the applicable requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716 
and 4 CFR part 102 have been met.
    (c) An agency which is requested by another agency to effect 
administrative offset must not do so without obtaining a written 
certification that the debtor owes the creditor agency a debt (including 
the amount and basis of the debt and the due date of the payment) and 
that all of the applicable requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716 and 4 CFR part 
102 have been met. An offsetting USDA agency may rely on the information 
contained in a requesting creditor agency's certification.
    (d) Only a creditor agency may agree to an installment repayment 
system or compromise, suspension or termination of the collection 
process.
    (e) A USDA agency which is requested by another agency to effect 
administrative offset may decline for good cause. Good cause includes 
direct or indirect disruption of the offsetting agency's essential 
program operations that might result from the offset. The refusal and 
the reasons must be sent in writing to the creditor agency.


<R05>
Sec. 3.25  Notice requirements before offset.

    (a) Before an agency effects administrative offset, the creditor 
agency must provide the debtor with a minimum of 30 calendar days' 
written notice that unpaid debt amounts will be collected by 
administrative offset against any money that the United States is going 
to pay to the debtor, unless the creditor agency determines immediate 
action is necessary under Sec. 3.26, or the debtor enters into a 
repayment agreement or requests review.
    (b) The Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset must be 
served on the debtor by personal delivery, first class mail, or 
certified mail and will state:
    (1) The amount of the debt, the date it was incurred, the name and 
address of the offsetting agency, and the program under which the debt 
was incurred.
    (2) The rate of interest accrued from the date of mailing or other 
delivery of the initial demand letter, and the amount of any other 
penalties or administrative costs added to the principal debt.

[[Page 258]]

    (3) The creditor agency's intention to collect the debt by 
administrative offset against any funds that might become available, 
until the principal debt and all accumulated interest and other charges 
are paid in full.
    (4) The date on which administrative offset will be effected, unless 
the creditor agency determines immediate action is necessary under 
Sec. 3.26, or the debtor enters into a repayment agreement or requests a 
review.
    (5) That the debtor has a right to inspect and copy agency or other 
Department records related to the debt. The debtor must pay copying 
costs unless they are waived by the agency.
    (6) That the debtor may enter into a written agreement to repay the 
debt, which must be approved by the creditor agency.
    (7) That the debtor has a right to obtain review of the agency's 
determination that the debt exists and the propriety of administrative 
offset.
    (8) That a repayment agreement or request for review may be sought 
only from the creditor agency and not the offsetting agency.
    (9) Time limitations and other procedures or conditions imposed by 
the agency.
    (10) The address to which the debtor should send all correspondence 
relating to the offset.
    (c) Any demand for payment will include a Notice of Intent to 
Collect by Administrative Offset, even if the debt is not delinquent at 
the time the letter is sent.

[50 FR 7722, Feb. 26, 1985, as amended at 55 FR 38662, Sept. 20, 1990; 
62 FR 60451, Nov. 10, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 3.26  Exceptions to notice requirements.

    (a) When the procedural requirements of Sec. 3.25 have been met by 
the creditor agency or under some other statutory or regulatory 
authority, an agency need not duplicate the notice before effecting 
administrative offset.
    (b) A USDA agency may effect administrative offset against a payment 
to be made to a debtor before completion of the procedures in Sec. 3.25 
when the agency finds, or is advised by the requesting creditor agency, 
that:
    (1) Failure to take the offset would substantially prejudice the 
Government's ability to collect the debt, such as where possible 
insolvency of the debtor might encourage competition among creditors for 
funds, or where expiration of a statute of limitations is imminent; and
    (2) The time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably 
permit the completion of these procedures.
    (c) The finding required by paragraph (b) of this section must be 
furnished by the offsetting agency to the debtor in writing as soon as 
reasonably possible after the offset is effected. Promptly after 
administrative offset is effected under this subsection, the creditor 
agency must give the debtor the notice required by Sec. 3.25.
    (d) An offsetting USDA agency may rely on the information contained 
in a creditor agency's request for administrative offset under this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 3.27  Inspection of USDA records related to the debt.

    A debtor who intends to inspect or copy agency or Departmental 
records with respect to the claim action must notify the agency in 
writing within 20 calendar days of the date the Notice of Intent to 
Offset was delivered to the debtor. In response, the agency must notify 
the debtor of the location, time, and any other conditions, consistent 
with part 1, subpart A of this title, for inspecting and copying, and 
that the debtor may be liable for reasonable copying expenses.

[50 FR 7722, Feb. 26, 1985, as amended at 55 FR 38662, Sept. 20, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 3.28  Written agreements to repay debt as alternative to administrative offset.

    The debtor may, in response to Notice of Intent to Collect by 
Administrative Offset, propose to the creditor agency a written 
agreement to repay the debt as an alternative to administrative offset. 
Any debtor who wishes to do this must submit a written proposal for 
repayment of the debt, which must be received by the creditor agency 
within 20 calendar days of the date the notice was delivered to the 
debtor. In response, the creditor agency must notify the debtor in 
writing whether

[[Page 259]]

the proposed agreement is acceptable. In exercising its discretion, the 
creditor agency must balance the Government's interest in collecting the 
debt against fairness to the debtor.


<R05>
Sec. 3.29  Hearings and reviews.

    (a) A debtor who receives a Notice of Intent to Collect by 
Administrative Offset may request a hearing or documentary review of the 
agency's determination that the debt exists and the propriety of 
administrative offset. Any debtor who wishes to do this must submit a 
written explanation of why the debtor disagrees and seeks review. The 
request must be received by the creditor agency within 20 calendar days 
of the date the notice was delivered to the debtor.
    (b) In response, the creditor agency must notify the debtor in 
writing whether the review will be by documentary review or by hearing. 
If the debtor requests a hearing, and the creditor agency decides to 
conduct a documentary review, the agency must notify the debtor of the 
reason why a hearing will not be granted. The agency must also advise 
the debtor of the procedures to be used in reviewing the documentary 
record, or of the date, location and procedures to be used if review is 
by a hearing.
    (c) Unless otherwise arranged by mutual agreement between the debtor 
and the agency, evidenced in writing, any documentary review or hearing 
will be conducted not less than 10 calendar days and no more than 45 
calendar days after receipt of the request for review.
    (d) Unless otherwise arranged by mutual agreement between the debtor 
and the agency, evidenced in writing, a documentary review or hearing 
will be based on agency records plus other relevant documentary evidence 
which may be submitted by the debtor within 10 calendar days after the 
request for review is received.
    (e)(1) Hearings will be as informal as possible, and will be 
conducted by a reviewing officer in a fair and expeditious manner. The 
reviewing officer need not use the formal rules of evidence with regard 
to the admissibility of evidence or the use of evidence once admitted. 
However, clearly irrelevant material should not be admitted, whether or 
not any party objects. Any party to the hearing may offer exhibits, such 
as copies of financial records, telephone memoranda, or agreements, 
provided the opposing party is notified at least 5 days before the 
hearing.
    (2) Debtors may represent themselves or may be represented at their 
own expense by an attorney or other person.
    (3) The substance of all significant matters discussed at the 
hearing must be recorded. No official record or transcript of the 
hearing need be created, but if a debtor requested that a transcript be 
made, it will be at the debtor's expense.
    (f)(1) Within no more than 30 calendar days after the hearing or the 
documentary review, the reviewing officer will issue a written decision 
to the debtor and the agency, including the supporting rationale for the 
decision. The deadline for issuance of the decision may be extended by 
the reviewing officer for good cause for no more than 30 calendar days, 
and beyond the 30 calendar days extension only with the consent of the 
debtor. The decision need not be lengthy or formal in style, but must 
address the substantive issues. The decision should address any 
significant procedural matter which was in dispute before or during the 
hearing or documentary review.
    (2) The reviewing officer's decision constitutes final agency action 
as to the following issues:
    (i) All issues of fact relating to the basis of the debt (including 
the existence of the debt and the propriety of administrative offset), 
in cases where the debtor previously had not been afforded due process; 
and
    (ii) The existence of the debt and the propriety of administrative 
offset, in cases where the debtor previously had been afforded due 
process as to issues of fact relating to the basis of the debt.
    (g) The reviewing officer will promptly distribute copies of the 
decision to the Assistant Secretary for Administration, USDA and to the 
debtor and the debtor's representative.

<R05>
Sec. 3.30  Stay of offset.

    (a)(1) Unless otherwise arranged by mutual agreement between the 
debtor and the agency, evidenced in writing, when an agency receives a 
debtor's request for inspection of agency records, the offset is stayed 
for no longer than 10 calendar days beyond the date set by the creditor 
agency for the record inspection.
    (2) When an agency receives a debtor's proposal for a repayment 
agreement, the offset is stayed until the debtor is notified as to 
whether the proposed agreement is acceptable.
    (3) When a review is conducted, the offset is stayed until the 
creditor agency issues a final written decision.
    (b) When administrative offset is stayed, the amount of the debt and 
interest will be withheld from payments to the debtor, but not applied 
against the debt until the stay expires. If withheld funds are later 
determined not to be subject to offset, they will be promptly refunded 
to the debtor.
    (c) When administrative offset is stayed, the creditor agency will 
immediately notify an offsetting agency to withhold the payment pending 
termination of the stay.

<R05>
Sec. 3.31  Agency procedures.

    (a) Any USDA agency may publish in the Federal Register, by rule or 
notice, a listing by category of the order in which any funds it holds 
for or intends to pay to a person may be reached by administrative 
offset.
    (b) For principal debts of $600 or more, an agency head may direct 
that no compromise be made, or no collection action suspended or 
terminated without advice from the USDA General Counsel.


<R05>
Sec. 3.32  Offset against amounts payable from Civil Service retirement and disability fund.

    An agency may request that monies payable to a debtor from the Civil 
Service Retirement and Disability Fund be administratively offset to 
collect debts owed to the agency by the debtor. The creditor agency must 
certify that the debtor owes the debt, the amount of the debt, and that 
the creditor agency has complied with 4 CFR 102.4 and Office of 
Personnel Management regulations. The request must be submitted to the 
official designated in Office of Personnel Management regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 3.33  Offset of debtor's judgment against the United States.

    Collection by offset against a judgment obtained by a debtor against 
the United States must be effected in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3728.


<R05>
Sec. 3.34  Interest, penalties and administrative costs.

    (a) USDA creditor agencies must attempt to collect interest, 
penalties and administrative costs on any delinquent debts owed to the 
United States in accordance with 4 CFR 102.13 and 102.14, or according 
to written documentation constituting the basis of the debt, or under 
any guidelines issued by the Assistant Secretary for Administration or 
by the creditor agency's fiscal officer.
    (1) Interest will not be assessed on interest, penalties or 
administrative costs. However, if a debtor defaults on a repayment 
agreement, interest which has accrued but was not collected under the 
defaulted agreement will be added to the principal to be paid under a 
new repayment agreement.
    (2) Agencies will assess a penalty of six percent a year on any 
unpaid debt balance delinquent for more than 90 days. This charge 
accrues from the date the debt becomes delinquent.
    (3) Agencies will charge the debtor for administrative costs 
incurred in processing and handling a delinquent debt. Administrative 
costs may include costs of obtaining credit reports, using a private 
debt collector, or selling collateral or property to satisfy the debt.
    (b) Agencies will waive the collection of interest assessed under 
these regulations on a delinquent debt or any portion of that debt which 
is paid within 30 days after the date on which interest began to accrue. 
Agencies may extend the 30-day period on a case-by-case basis, if it is 
determined that an extension is appropriate because of partial

[[Page 261]]

or complete absence of culpability by the debtor for the delay in 
payment.
    (c) Agencies may waive collection of all or part of the interest, 
penalties, and administrative costs assessed under these regulations 
when it is determined:
    (1) That the Government cannot collect the full amount of the 
delinquent debt or interest and costs because of the debtor's inability 
to pay the full amount within a reasonable time (considering such 
factors as those listed at 4 CFR 103.2(b)), or the debtor's refusal to 
pay the full amount where the Government is unable to effect collection 
in full within a reasonable time; or
    (2) That there is a real doubt concerning the Government's ability 
to recover interest, penalties or costs in court, either because of the 
legal or equitable issues involved or because the facts are being 
disputed in court; or
    (3) That the cost of collecting the delinquent debt with interest, 
penalties, or costs outweighs the amounts to be recovered; or
    (4) That the collection of some or all of these charges would be 
against equity and good conscience or not in the best interests of the 
United States; or
    (5) (For waiver of interest) that a request is pending for 
reconsideration, administrative review, or waiver of the underlying 
delinquent debt under a statute allowing but not requiring one or more 
of these remedies. If the statute under which review or waiver is sought 
by the debtor prohibits the agency from collecting the delinquent debt 
before resolution of the review or waiver request, interest, penalties 
and administrative costs must be waived during the period in which 
collection action is stayed. Otherwise, interest, penalties and 
administrative costs will not be waived except for a separate reason 
included in this section; or
    (6) (For waiver of interest) that the agency has agreed to a 
repayment plan consistent with 4 CFR 102.11 and with Sec. 3.28 of this 
subpart, there is no indication of fault or lack of good faith by the 
debtor, and the amount of interest is sufficiently large relative to the 
size of the installments reasonably affordable by the debtor that the 
principal debt would never be repaid; or
    (7) The debt is repaid after the date on which interest, penalties 
and administrative costs became payable and the estimated costs of 
recovering the remaining interest balance exceed the amount owed to the 
agency.
    (d) The creditor agency must document its reasons for waiving 
interest, penalties, or administrative costs. This documentation must be 
retained by the agency for at least three years.

submit a proposed written agreement to repay the debt which is received 
by the Secretary within 30 calendar days of the date of the Notice of 
Intent.
    (b) Secretary's response. The Secretary will notify the employee 
whether the employee's prosposed written agreement for repayment is 
acceptable. The Secretary may accept a repayment agreement instead of 
proceeding by offset. In making this determination, the Secretary will

hardship to the employee. If the debt is delinquent and the employee has 
not disputed its existence or amount, the Secretary will accept a 
repayment agreement, instead of offset, for good cause such as, if the

financial hardship or would be against equity and good conscience.

    (b) If the employee filed a petition for a hearing with the 
Secretary before the expiration of the period provided for in Sec. 3.56 
then deductions will begin after the hearing officer has provided the 
employee with a hearing, and a final written decision has been rendered 
in favor of the Secretary.
    (c) If an employee retires or resigns before collection of the 
amount of the indebtedness is completed, the remaining indebtedness will 
be collected according to the procedures for administrative offset (see 
subpart B of this part).


<R05>
Sec. 3.63  Procedures for salary offset: Types of collection.

    A debt will be collected in a lump-sum or in installments. 
Collection will be by lump-sum collection unless the employee is 
financially unable to pay in one lump-sum, or if the amount of the debt 
exceeds 15 percent of disposable pay for an ordinary pay period. In 
these cases, deduction will be by installments, as set forth in 
Sec. 3.64.


<R05>
Sec. 3.64  Procedures for salary offset: Methods of collection.

    (a) General. A debt will be collected by deductions at officially-
established pay intervals from an employee's current pay account, unless 
the employee and the Secretary agree to alternative arrangements for 
repayment under Sec. 3.61.
    (b) Installment deductions. Installment deductions will be made over 
a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment. The size 
and frequency of installment deductions will bear a reasonable relation 
to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. However, the 
amount deducted for any period will not exceed 15 percent of the 
disposable pay from which the deduction is made, unless the employee has 
agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. If possible, the 
installment payment will be sufficient in size and frequency to 
liquidate the debt in

[[Page 266]]

no more than three years. Installment payments of less than $25 per pay 
period or $50 a month will be accepted only in the most unusual 
circumstances.
    (c) Sources of deductions. The Department will make deductions only 
from basic pay, special pay, incentive pay, retired pay, retainer pay, 
or in the case of an employee not entitled to basic pay, other 
authorized pay.

    So long as there are no statutory or contractual provisions to the 
contrary, no employee payment (or all or portion of a debt) collected 
under these regulations will be interpreted as a waiver of any rights 
that the employee may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514.


<R05>
Sec. 3.67  Refunds.

    The Department will refund promptly to the appropriate individual 
amounts offset under these regulations when:
    (a) A debt is waived or otherwise found not owing the United States

was reached in which the debtor was legally discharged of all or a 
portion of the obligation.

<R05>
Sec. 5.1  Parity index and index of prices received by farmers.

    (a) The parity index and related indices for the purpose of 
calculating parity prices after May 1, 1976, according to the formula 
contained in section 301(a) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, 
as amended by the Agricultural Acts of 1948, 1949, 1954, and 1956 
(hereinafter referred to as section 301(a)) shall be the index of prices 
paid by farmers, interest, taxes, and farm wage rates, as revised May 
1976 and published in the May 28, 1976, and subsequent issues of the 
monthly report, ``Agricultural Prices.'' The publication of these 
indices by the National Agricultural Statistics Service in the monthly 
report, ``Agricultural Prices'', shall be continued.
    (b) The measure of the general level of prices received by farmers 
as provided for in section 301(a)(1)(B)(ii) after January 1, 1959, shall 
be the index of prices received by farmers as revised January 1959 and 
published in the January 30, 1959, and subsequent issues of 
``Agricultural Prices''. The simple average of the 120 monthly indices 
included in the preceding 10 calendar

[[Page 272]]

years plus an adjustment to take account of the effect on the index of 
any adjustment made on average prices of individual commodities as 
hereinafter specified shall be used in the calculation of the adjusted 
base prices. Parity prices heretofore published for periods prior to 
January 1, 1959 shall not be revised.
    (c) The term milkfat as used in these regulations is synonymous with 
the term butterfat, and when any statute requires calculation of the 
parity price of butterfat, the parity price of milkfat shall be the 
parity price of butterfat.

prices. For cigar binder tobacco, types 51-52, for each of the marketing 
seasons beginning in the years 1949 through 1958, 37.9 cents per pound

shall be the simple average of the 12 monthly estimates of the prices 
received by farmers as published by the National Agricultural Statistics 
Service in ``Agricultural Prices'' for those commodities for which such 
prices are available. An allowance for unredeemed loans and purchase 
agreement deliveries, any supplemental payments resulting from price 
support operations, and the value of marketing certificates, such as 
those received by producers of wheat pursuant to the Agricultural

Sec. 5.5  Publication of season average, calendar year, and parity price data.

    (a) New adjusted base prices for all of the commodities on a 
calendar year basis and for as many of the commodities on a marketing 
season average basis as are practicable shall be published on or about 
January 31 of each year. In cases where preliminary marketing season 
average price data are used in estimating the adjusted base prices 
published in January, any additional price data which becomes available 
shall be used in estimating a revised adjusted base price which shall be 
published prior to the beginning of the marketing season for the 
commodity.
    (b) The official parity prices determined under section 301(a)(1) 
and the regulations in this part and the indexes and relevant price data 
shall be published in the monthly report ``Agricultural Prices'' issued 
by the National Agricultural Statistics Service. Parity prices for all 
commodities for which parity prices are computed shall be so published 
in the January and July issues each year. The parity prices published in 
other issues may be restricted to those which the National Agricultural 
Statistics Service, after consultation with the Agricultural Marketing 
Service, the Farm Service Agency, and any other interested government 
agency, considers necessary or desirable. The parity prices determined 
in accordance with this part shall be the parity prices used in other 
reports, determinations, or documents of the Department.

<R05>
Sec. 5.6  Revision of the parity price of a commodity.

    (a) Initiation of hearings. The ``modernized'' parity formula 
specified in section 301(a)(1) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 
1938, as amended, takes into consideration the average prices received 
by farmers for agricultural commodities during the last ten years and is 
designed gradually to adjust relative parity prices of specific 
commodities for persistent or continuing changes in demand and supply 
conditions which are reflected in market prices. Accordingly, only in 
rare cases is it possible for the parity price of any agricultural 
commodity to become seriously out of line with the parity prices of 
other agricultural commodities. In any case, however, in which producers 
of any agricultural commodity believe that the parity price of such 
commodity, as computed pursuant to the provisions of section 301(a)(1), 
is seriously out of line with the parity prices of other agricultural 
commodities, a request for a public hearing under section 301(a)(1)(F) 
may be submitted to the Secretary of Agriculture by a substantial number 
of interested producers. The producers shall also furnish to the 
Secretary, with such request or separately, data supporting their 
conclusion that the parity price of such commodity is seriously out of 
line with the parity prices of other commodities. Upon receipt of such a 
request with supporting data, or at any time upon the Secretary's own 
motion, this Department will make a preliminary study of the 
relationship between the parity price of such commodity and the parity 
prices of other

[[Page 275]]

commodities, and if the Secretary concludes that there appears to be 
reasonable grounds for believing that the parity price of such commodity 
is seriously out of line with the parity prices of other agricultural 
commodities, a hearing will be held pursuant to the provisions of 
section 301(a)(1)(F).
    (b) Notice of hearing. If the Secretary of Agriculture determines 
that such a hearing shall be held, he shall issue a notice of the 
hearing, which shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk of the United 
States Department of Agriculture, who shall promptly (1) cause such 
notice to be published in the Federal Register, and (2) mail a copy 
thereof to each of the producers who requested the hearing and to grower 
organizations known to be interested in the hearing. Legal notice of the 
hearing shall be deemed to be given upon filing such notice with the 
Federal Register for publication, and failure to give notice in the 
manner otherwise provided in this paragraph shall not affect the 
legality of the notice. The notice of hearing shall state the purpose of 
the hearing and the time and place of the hearing. The time of the 
hearing shall not be less than fifteen days after the date of 
publication of the notice in the Federal Register, unless the Secretary 
shall determine that an emergency exists which requires a shorter period 
of notice, in which case the period of notice shall be that which the 
Secretary determines to be reasonable in the circumstances.
    (c) Conduct of hearing--(1) Presiding officer. Each hearing held 
under section 301(a)(1)(F) shall be presided over by a Hearing Examiner 
of the Office of Administrative Law Judges or such other employee of the 
Department as the Secretary may designate for the purpose.
    (2) Time and place of hearing. Each hearing shall be heard at the 
time and place set forth in the notice of hearing but may be continued 
by the presiding officer from day to day or adjourned to a later date or 
to a different place without notice other than the announcement thereof 
at the hearing.
    (3) Order of procedure. At the commencement of the hearing, the 
presiding officer shall file as an exhibit a copy of the Federal 
Register containing the notice of the hearing and shall then outline 
briefly the procedure to be followed. Evidence shall then be received 
from interested persons in such order as the presiding officer shall 
prescribe.
    (4) Submission of evidence. The hearing shall be conducted in such a 
way as to obtain a clear and orderly record. All interested persons 
appearing at the hearing shall be given reasonable opportunity to offer 
data, views, or arguments relevant to (i) whether the parity price for 
the agricultural commodity involved is or is not seriously out of line 
with the parity prices of other agricultural commodities, and (ii) the 
proper relationship between the parity price of such commodity and the 
parity prices of other agricultural commodities and the revisions, if 
any, which should be made in computing the parity price of such 
commodity. All documentary exhibits shall be submitted in duplicate. The 
presiding officer shall, insofar as possible, exclude irrelevant, 
immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence but shall not apply technical 
judicial rules of evidence. Every witness shall be subject to 
questioning by the presiding officer or by any other representative of 
the Department, but cross-examination by other persons shall not be 
allowed, except in the discretion of the presiding officer. The 
proceedings at the hearing shall be transcribed verbatim.
    (5) Written arguments. The presiding officer shall fix a time, not 
to exceed ten days from the close of the hearing, within which 
interested persons may file written arguments with the Hearing Clerk.
    (d) Preparation and issuance of determination--(1) Preparation of 
recommendation. As soon as practicable after the close of the hearing, 
the presiding officer, or such employees of the Department as may be 
assigned for the purpose, shall review, consider, and weigh all evidence 
of probative value, views, and arguments which have been submitted, and 
may consider other pertinent information and data which is available in 
the Department of Agriculture, and shall submit a recommendation thereon 
to the Secretary.

[[Page 276]]

    (2) Determination by the Secretary. As soon as possible after 
receipt of the recommendation, the Secretary shall determine whether the 
parity price of such commodity computed in accordance with section 
301(a)(1) appears to be seriously out of line with the parity prices of 
other agricultural commodities whether the facts require a revision of 
the method of computing the parity price of such commodity, and the 
revision, if any, which is required in the method of computing the 
parity price of such commodity. Such determination by the Secretary 
shall be final. The Secretary's determination shall be filed with the 
Hearing Clerk who shall cause the determination to be published promptly 
in the Federal Register. The Hearing Clerk shall also mail a copy of the 
determination to each producer and grower organization which 
participated in or is known to be interested in the hearing. Upon 
application to the Hearing Clerk, any person shall be entitled to a copy 
of the determination.

Sec. 6.2  Responsibility for actions under section 22 and section 8(a).

    The primary responsibility within the Department of Agriculture for 
action on matters for which the Secretary is responsible under section 
22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended, and section 
8(a) of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951 is assigned to the 
Administrator, Foreign Agricultural Service (referred to in this part as 
the ``Administrator''), but the other offices, agencies, and bureaus of 
the Department whose activities will be affected by any action under 
section 22 or section 8(a) shall be consulted by the Administrator in 
discharging his responsibility under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 6.3  Requests by interested persons for action by Department of Agriculture.

    (a) Section 22. A request for action under section 22 should be 
submitted in duplicate to the Administrator, Foreign Agricultural 
Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Washington 25, D.C. 
Such request shall

[[Page 277]]

include a statement of the reasons why action would be warranted under 
section 22 and shall be supported by appropriate information and data.
    (b) Section 8(a). A request for action under section 8(a) should be 
submitted in duplicate to the Administrator, Foreign Agricultural 
Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Washington 25, D.C. 
Such request shall include a statement of the reasons why the commodity 
is perishable, and why, due to such perishability, a condition exists 
requiring emergency treatment, and shall be supported by appropriate 
information and data. A request under section 8(a) submitted in 
connection with a proposed section 7 (Trade Agreements Extension Act of 
1951) investigation shall not be acted upon until a section 7 
application has been properly filed by the person making the request 
with the Tariff Commission, and a copy of such application and 
supporting information and data are furnished the Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 6.4  Investigations.

    (a) Section 22. The Administrator shall cause an investigation to be 
made whenever, based upon a request submitted pursuant to Sec. 6.3 or 
upon other information available to him, he determines that there is 
reasonable ground to believe that the imposition of import quotas or 
fees under section 22 may be warranted, or that the termination or 
modification of import quotas or fees in effect under section 22 may be 
warranted.
    (b) Section 8(a). The Administrator shall cause an immediate 
investigation to be made whenever (1) a request is received for 
emergency treatment in connection with an application properly filed 
with the Tariff Commission under section 7; (2) a request is received 
for emergency treatment under section 22 if the Administrator determines 
that there is reasonable ground to believe that the imposition of import 
quotas or fees under section 22 may be warranted; or (3) the 
Administrator, upon the basis of other information available to him, has 
reasonable ground for believing that emergency treatment under section 
8(a) is necessary. The Administrator shall expedite to the fullest 
practicable extent his attention to requests for emergency treatment 
under section 8(a), and such requests shall receive priority over 
requests for other action under section 22. The investigation shall 
cover (1) whether the commodity is a perishable agricultural commodity; 
(2) whether, due to the perishability of the commodity, a condition 
exists requiring emergency treatment as indicated by such factors as (i) 
the marketing season for the commodity, (ii) past and prospective 
domestic production, stocks, requirements, and prices, (iii) past and 
prospective imports; and (3) such other matters as the Administrator 
determines are relevant to a determination as to whether emergency 
treatment for the commodity is necessary. No public hearing shall be 
held in connection with investigations under this paragraph.


<R05>
Sec. 6.5  Hearings under section 22.

    The Administrator is authorized to provide for such public hearings 
as he deems necessary to discharge the responsibility for action under 
section 22 vested in him by Secs. 6.2 and 6.4(a). In view of the need, 
however, for prompt action on requests for action under section 22, 
public hearings shall be held in connection with investigations 
conducted under Sec. 6.4(a) only when the Administrator determines that 
a public hearing is necessary to obtain supplementary information not 
otherwise available. Any public hearing which is held shall be conducted 
by representatives designated for the purpose by the Administrator; 
shall be preceded by such public notice as, in the opinion of the 
Administrator, will afford interested persons reasonable opportunity to 
attend and present information; and minutes of the proceedings at such 
hearing shall be obtained. Hearings shall be informal and technical 
rules of evidence shall not apply. Such hearings are for the purpose of 
obtaining information for the assistance of the Secretary. However, in 
discharging his responsibilities under section 22, the Secretary is not 
restricted to the information adduced at the hearings.

[[Page 278]]


<R05>
Sec. 6.6  Submission of recommendations under section 22.

    (a) The Administrator shall make a report to the Secretary upon the 
completion of each investigation made by him pursuant to Sec. 6.4(a). 
The report shall summarize the information disclosed by the 
investigation; shall contain the recommendations of the Administrator; 
and, in case action under section 22 is recommended, shall be 
accompanied by a suggested letter from the Secretary to the President 
recommending that the Tariff Commission be directed to conduct an 
investigation. Such report shall be submitted to the other offices, 
agencies, and bureaus of the Department of Agriculture whose activities 
would be affected, for concurrence or comment.
    (b) The Secretary will recommend that the President direct the 
Tariff Commission to conduct an investigation under section 22 only if 
he has reason to believe, upon the basis of the information available to 
him, that import quotas or fees should be imposed.


<R05>
Sec. 6.7  Submission of recommendations under section 8(a) (emergency treatment).

    (a) Section 22. The Administrator's report submitted pursuant to 
Sec. 6.6 shall indicate whether or not emergency treatment is necessary. 
If emergency treatment is recommended, the report shall discuss the 
condition which requires emergency treatment and be accompanied by 
suggested letters from the Secretary to the President, to the Tariff 
Commission, and to the petitioner (if any) advising them of the 
Secretary's determination. The suggested letter from the Secretary to 
the President shall include a recommendation as to whether such 
emergency treatment should take the form of action by the President 
prior to receiving the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, or 
whether a decision by the President may appropriately be withheld until 
the recommendations of the Tariff Commission are received. If emergency 
treatment requested is not recommended, the report to the Secretary 
shall be accompanied by suggested letters from the Secretary to the 
petitioner and the Tariff Commission stating the action taken.
    (b) Section 7. The Administrator shall make a report to the 
Secretary upon the completion of each investigation made by him pursuant 
to Sec. 6.4(b). The report shall summarize the information disclosed by 
the investigation, including the points listed in Sec. 6.4(b) which were 
considered in reaching the recommendation, and shall contain the 
recommendations of the Administrator as to whether or not emergency 
treatment is required. If emergency treatment is recommended, the report 
shall discuss the condition which requires emergency treatment and shall 
be accompanied by suggested letters from the Secretary to the President, 
to the Tariff Commission, and to the petitioner advising them of the 
Secretary's determination. The suggested letter from the Secretary to 
the President shall include a recommendation as to whether such 
emergency treatment should take the form of action by the President 
prior to receiving the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, or 
whether a decision by the President may appropriately be withheld until 
the recommendations of the Tariff Commission are received. If emergency 
treatment is not recommended, the report to the Secretary shall be 
accompanied by suggested letters from the Secretary to the petitioner 
and to the Tariff Commission stating the action taken. Each such report 
shall be submitted to the other offices, agencies, and bureaus of the 
Department of Agriculture whose activities would be affected, for 
concurrence or comment.


<R05>
Sec. 6.8  Representation at Tariff Commission hearings.

    The Department of Agriculture shall be represented at all hearings 
conducted by the Tariff Commission under section 22 by persons 
designated by the Administrator, assisted by a representative of the

recommendations of the Department of Agriculture, shall submit such 
information and data in support thereof as are available, and shall 
exercise the right of examining other witnesses which is granted to the 
Secretary.

<R05>
Sec. 6.20  Introduction.

    (a) Presidential Proclamation 6763 of December 23, 1994, modified 
the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States affecting the import 
regime for certain articles of dairy products. The Proclamation 
terminated quantitative restrictions that had been imposed pursuant to 
section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended (7 
U.S.C. 624); proclaimed tariff-rate quotas for such articles pursuant to 
Pub. L. 103-465; and specified which of such articles may be entered 
only by or for the account of a person to whom a license has been issued 
by the Secretary of Agriculture.
    (b) Effective January 1, 1995, the prior regime of absolute quotas 
for certain dairy products was replaced by a system of tariff-rate 
quotas. The articles subject to licensing under the new tariff-rate 
quotas are listed in Appendices 1, 2, and 3 of this subpart. Licenses 
will be issued pursuant to the provisions of this subpart for the 1997 
and subsequent quota years. These licenses will permit the holder to 
import specified quantities of the subject articles into the United 
States at the applicable in-quota rate of duty. If an importer has no 
license for an article subject to a tariff-rate quota, such importer 
will, with certain exceptions, be required to pay the applicable over-
quota rate of duty.
    (c) The Secretary of Agriculture has determined that this subpart 
will, to the fullest extent practicable, result in fair and equitable 
allocation of the right to import articles subject to such tariff-rate 
quotas. The subpart will also maximize utilization of the tariff-rate 
quotas for such articles, taking due account of any special factors 
which may have affected or maybe affecting the trade in the articles 
concerned.

historical license (Appendix 1) for the same quantity of butter for the 
subsequent quota year and each year thereafter, provided that such 
person has used at least 90 percent of the original license issued for 
the previous quota year and meets the requirements of paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii). However, if a person is issued a historical license pursuant 
to this paragraph, that person may not be issued a nonhistorical license

all been issued such a nonhistorical license.

2). A person may annually apply for a nonhistorical license for cheese

October 31 prior to the beginning of the quota year.
    (c) Exceptions. (1) A licensee that fails in a quota year to enter

paragraph, the amount of an article permitted under the license will 
exclude any amounts surrendered pursuant to Sec. 6.26(a), but will 
include any additional allocations received pursuant to Sec. 6.26(b).

[[Page 282]]

    (2) Paragraph (c)(1) of this section will not apply where the

Authority to waive this requirement. The licensee shall submit evidence 
that the country maintains an export monopoly as defined in this 
paragraph. For the purposes of this paragraph ``export monopoly'' means 
a privilege vested in one or more persons consisting of the exclusive 
right to carry on the exportation of any article of dairy products from 
a country to the United States.
    (4) The Licensing Authority will not issue a nonhistorical license 
(Appendix 2) for an article from a country during a quota year to an 
applicant who is affiliated with another applicant to whom the Licensing 
Authority is issuing a non-historical license for the same article from 
the same country for that quota year. Further, the Licensing Authority 
will not issue a nonhistorical license for butter to an applicant who is 
affiliated with another applicant to whom the Licensing Authority is 
issuing a historical butter license of 57,000 kilograms or greater. For 
the purpose of this paragraph, an applicant will be deemed affiliated 
with another applicant if:
    (i) The applicant is the spouse, brother, sister, parent, child or 
grandchild of such other applicant;
    (ii) The applicant is the spouse, brother, sister, parent, child or 
grandchild of an individual who owns or controls such other applicant;
    (iii) The applicant is owned or controlled by the spouse, brother,

controls such other applicant.
    (iv) Both applicants are 5 percent or more owned or directly or 
indirectly controlled, by the same person;
    (v) The applicant, or a person who owns or controls the applicant, 
benefits from a trust that controls such other applicant.

(Appendix 2) for an article from a country during a quota year to an 
applicant who is associated with another applicant to whom the Licensing 
Authority is issuing a nonhistorical license for the same article from 
the same country for that quota year. Further, the Licensing Authority 
will not issue a nonhistorical license for butter to an applicant who is 
associated with another applicant to whom the Licensing Authority is 
issuing a historical butter license for 57,000 kilograms or greater. For 
the purpose of this paragraph, an applicant will be deemed associated 
with another applicant if:
    (i) The applicant is an employee of, or is controlled by an employee 
of, such other applicant;
    (ii) The applicant manages or is managed by such other applicant, or 
economically benefits, directly or indirectly, from the use of the

form, and
    (ii) The commercial invoice or bill of sale for the quantities and 
number of export shipments required under Sec. 6.23, during the 12-month 
period ending August 31 prior to the quota year for which license is

<R05>
Sec. 6.25  Allocation of licenses.

    (a) Historical licenses for the 1997 quota year (Appendix 1). (1) A 
person issued a historical license for the 1996 quota year will be 
issued a historical license for the 1997 quota year in an amount equal 
to the Basic Annual Allocation level used by the Licensing Authority for 
the 1996 quota year provided that such person meets the requirements of 
Sec. 6.23(b)(1) and Sec. 6.23(c).
    (2) A person issued a nonhistorical license for the 1996 quota year 
will be issued a historical license for the 1997 quota year for the same 
quantity as the license for the 1996 quota year, provided that such 
person meets the requirements of Sec. 6.23.
    (3) If a person was issued more than one historical license, or one 
or more historical licenses and a nonhistorical license, for the same 
article from the same country for the 1996 quota year, such person will 
be issued a single historical license for the 1997 quota year, the 
amount of which shall be determined in accordance with paragraphs, (a) 
(1) and (2) of this section.
    (b) Historical licenses for the 1998 and subsequent quota years 
(Appendix 1). (1) A person issued a historical license for the 1997 
quota year will be issued a historical license in the same amount for 
the same article from the same country for the 1998 quota year and for 
each subsequent quota year except that:
    (i) Beginning with the 1999 quota year, a person who has surrendered 
more than 50 percent of such historical license in each of the prior 
three quota years will thereafter be issued a license in an amount equal 
to the average annual quantity entered during those three quota years; 
and
    (ii) Beginning with the quota year 2001, a person who has 
surrendered more than 50 percent of such historical license in at least 
three of the prior five quota years will thereafter be issued a license 
in an amount equal to the average annual quantity entered during those 
five quota years.
    (2) However, prior to the beginning of the 1999 quota year, the 
Secretary of Agriculture may determine that the exceptions in paragraphs 
(b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section shall not apply in light of market 
conditions.
    (c) Nonhistorical licenses (Appendix 2). The Licensing Authority 
will allocate nonhistorical licenses on the basis of a rank-order 
lottery system, which will operate as follows:
    (1) The minimum license size shall be:
    (i) Where the article is cheese or cheese product:
    (A) The total amount available for nonhistorical license where such 
amount is less than 9,500 kilograms;

[[Page 284]]

    (B) 9,500 kilograms where the total amount available for 
nonhistorical license is between 9,500 kilograms and 500,000 kilograms, 
inclusive;
    (C) 19,000 kilograms where the total amount available for 
nonhistorical license is between 500,001 kilograms and 1,000,000 
kilograms, inclusive;
    (D) 38,000 kilograms where the total amount available for 
nonhistorical license is greater than 1,000,000 kilograms; or
    (E) An amount less than the minimum license size established in 
paragraphs (c)(1)(i) (A) through (D) of this section, if requested by 
the licensee;
    (ii) Where the article is not cheese or cheese product:
    (A) The total amount available for nonhistorical license where such 
amount is less than 19,000 kilograms;
    (B) 19,000 kilograms where the total amount available for 
nonhistorical license is between 19,000 kilograms and 550,000 kilograms, 
inclusive;
    (C) 38,000 kilograms where the total amount available for 
nonhistorical license is between 550,001 kilograms and 1,000,000 
kilograms, inclusive; and
    (D) 57,000 kilograms where the total amount available for 
nonhistorical license is greater than 1,000,000 kilograms;
    (E) An amount less than the minimum license sizes established in 
paragraphs (c)(1)(i) (A) through (D) of this section, if requested by 
the licensee.
    (2) Taking into account the order of preference expressed by each 
applicant, as required by Sec. 6.24(c), the Licensing Authority will 
allocate licenses for an article from a country by a series of random 
draws. A license of minimum size will be issued to each applicant in the 
order established by such draws until the total amount of such article 
in Appendix 2 has been allocated. An applicant that receives a license 
for an article will be removed from the pool for subsequent draws until 
every applicant has been allocated at least one license, provided that 
the licenses for which they applied are not already fully allocated. Any 
amount remaining after the random draws which is less than the 
applicable minimum license size may, at the discretion of the Licensing 
Authority, be prorated equally among the licenses awarded for that 
article.
    (d) Designated licenses (Appendix 3). (1) With respect to an article 
listed in Appendix 3, the government of the applicable country may, not 
later than October 31 prior to the beginning of a quota year, submit 
directly and in writing to the Licensing Authority:
    (i) The names and addresses of the importers that it is designating 
to receive licenses; and
    (ii) The amount, in percentage terms, of such article for which each 
such importer is being designated. Where quantities for designation 
result from both Tokyo Round concessions and Uruguay Round concessions, 
the designations should be made in terms of each.
    (2) To the extent practicable, the Licensing Authority will issue 
designated licenses to those importers, and in those amounts, indicated 
by the government of the applicable country, provided that the importer 
designated meets the eligibility requirements set forth in Sec. 6.23. 
Consistent with the international obligations of the United States, the 
Licensing Authority may disregard a designation if the Licensing 
Authority determines that the person designated is not eligible for any 
of the reasons set forth in Sec. 6.23(c) (1) or (2).
    (3) If a government of a country which negotiated in the Uruguay 
Round for the right to designate importers has not done so, but 
determines to designate importers for the next quota year, it shall 
indicate its intention to do so directly and in writing to the Licensing 
Authority not later than July 1 prior to the beginning of such next 
quota year. Furthermore, if a government that has designated importers 
for a quota year determines that it will not continue to designate 
importers for the next quota year, it shall so indicate directly and in 
writing to the Licensing Authority, not later than July 1 prior to such 
next quota year.

    Effective Date Note: At 63 FR 13481, Mar. 20, 1998, in Sec. 6.25, 
paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) were suspended indefinitely.


<R05>
Sec. 6.26  Surrender and reallocation.

    (a) If a licensee determines that it will not enter the entire 
amount of an article permitted under its license, such licensee shall 
surrender its license

[[Page 285]]

right to enter the amount that it does not intend to enter. Surrender 
shall be made to the Licensing Authority in writing, mailed in 
accordance with Sec. 6.35(b) and postmarked no later than October 1. Any 
surrender shall be final and shall be only for that quota year, except 
as provided in Sec. 6.25(b). The amount of the license not surrendered 
shall be subject to the license use requirements of Sec. 6.23(c)(1).
    (b) For each quota year, the Licensing Authority will, to the extent 
practicable, reallocate any amounts surrendered.
    (c) Any person who has been issued a license for a quota year may 
apply to receive additional license, or addition to an existing license 
for a portion of the amount being reallocated. The application shall be 
submitted to the Licensing Authority by mail postmarked no earlier than 
September 1 and not later than September 15, in accordance with 
Sec. 6.35(b), and shall specify:
    (1) The name and control number of the applicant;
    (2) The article and country being requested, the applicable 
Additional U.S. Note number and, if more than one article is requested, 
a rank-order by Additional U.S. Note number; and
    (3) If applicable, the number of the license issued to the applicant 
for that quota year permitting entry of the same article from the same 
country.
    (d) The Licensing Authority will reallocate surrendered amounts 
among applicants as follows:
    (1) The minimum license size, or addition to an existing license, 
will be the total amount of the article from a country surrendered, or 
10,000 kilograms, whichever is less;
    (2) Minimum size licenses, or additions to an existing license, will 
be allocated among applicants requesting articles on the basis of the 
rank-order lottery system described in Sec. 6.25(c);
    (3) If there is any amount of an article from a country left after 
minimum size licenses have been issued, the Licensing Authority may 
allocate the remainder in any manner it determines equitable among 
applicants who have requested that article; and
    (4) No amount will be reallocated to a licensee who has surrendered 
a portion of its license for the same article from the same country 
during that quota year unless all other licensees applying for a 
reallocated quantity have been allocated a license;
    (e) However, if the government of an exporting country chooses to 
designate eligible importers for surrendered amounts under Appendix 3, 
the Licensing Authority shall issue the licenses in accordance with 
Sec. 6.25(d)(2), provided that the government of the exporting country 
notifies the Licensing Authority of its designations no later than 
September 1. Such notification shall contain the names and addresses of 
the importers that it is designating and the amount in percentage terms 
of such article for which each importer is being designated. In such 
case the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section shall not apply.
    (f) Except for paragraph (a), the provisions of Sec. 6.26 for 
surrendered and reallocated tariff-rate quota shares do not apply for 
the 1996 quota year. Reissued tariff-rate quota shares for licenses 
surrendered during 1996 will be made pursuant to the provisions in 
effect for the 1996 quota year (Sec. 6.26(f)(2) as contained in 7 CFR 
subtitle A, revised as of January 1, 1996).


<R05>
Sec. 6.27  Limitations on use of license.

    (a) A licensee shall not obtain or use a license for speculation, 
brokering, or offering for sale, or permit any other person to use the 
license for profit.
    (b) A licensee who is eligible as a manufacturer or processor, 
pursuant to Sec. 6.23, shall process at least 75 percent of its licensed 
imports in such person's own facilities and maintain the records 
necessary to so substantiate.


<R05>
Sec. 6.28  Transfer of license.

    (a) If a licensee sells or conveys its business involving articles 
covered by this subpart to another person, including the complete 
transfer of the attendant assets, the Licensing Authority will transfer 
to such other person the historical, nonhistorical or designated license 
issued for that quota year. Such sale or conveyance must be 
unconditional, except that it may be in escrow with the sole condition 
for return of escrow being that the Licensing Authority determines that 
such sale

[[Page 286]]

does not meet the requirements of this paragraph.
    (b) The parties seeking transfer of license shall give written 
notice to the Licensing Authority of the intended sale or conveyance 
described in paragraph (a) by mail as required in Sec. 6.35(b). The 
notice must be received by the Licensing Authority at least 20 working 
days prior to the intended consummation of the sale or conveyance. Such 
written notice shall include copies of the documents of sale or 
conveyance. The Licensing Authority will review the documents for 
compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and 
advise the parties in writing of its findings by the end of the 20-day 
period. The parties shall have the burden of demonstrating to the 
satisfaction of the Licensing Authority that the contemplated sale or 
conveyance complies with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this 
section. Within 15 days of the consummation of the sale or conveyance, 
the parties shall mail copies of the final documents to the Licensing 
Authority, in accordance with Sec. 6.35(b). The Licensing Authority will 
not transfer the licenses unless the documents are submitted in 
accordance with this paragraph.
    (c) The eligibility for a license of a person to whom a business is 
sold or conveyed will be determined for the next quota year in 
accordance with Sec. 6.23. For the purposes of Sec. 6.23(b)(1) the 
person to whom a business is sold or conveyed shall be deemed to be the 
person to whom the historical licenses were issued during the quota year 
in which the sale or conveyance occurred. Further, for the purposes of 
Sec. 6.23 (b) and (c), the entries made under such licenses by the 
original licensee during the year in which the sale of conveyance is 
made, shall be considered as having been made by the person to whom the 
business was sold or conveyed.


<R05>
Sec. 6.29  Use of licenses.

    (a) An article entered under a license shall be an article produced 
in the country specified on the license.
    (b) An article entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption 
under a license must be entered in the name of the licensee as the 
importer of record by the licensee or its agent, and must be owned by 
the licensee at the time of such entry.
    (c) If the article entered or withdrawn from warehouse for 
consumption was purchased by the licensee through a direct sale from a 
foreign supplier, the licensee shall present, at the time of entry:
    (1) A true and correct copy of a through bill of lading from the 
country; and
    (2) A commercial invoice or bill of sale from the seller, showing 
the quantity and value of the product, the date of purchase and the

    (3) Where the article was entered into warehouse by the foreign 
supplier, Customs Form 7501 endorsed by the foreign supplier and the 
commercial invoice.
    (d) If the article entered was purchased by the licensee via sale-
in-transit, the licensee shall present, at the time of entry:
    (1) A true and correct copy of a through bill of lading endorsed by 
the original consignee of the goods;
    (2) A certified copy of the commercial invoice or bill of sale from 
the foreign supplier to the original consignee of the goods; and
    (3) A commercial invoice or bill of sale from the original consignee 
to the licensee.
    (e) If the article entered was purchased by the licensee in 
warehouse, the licensee shall present, at the time of entry:
    (1) Customs Form 7501 endorsed by the original consignee of the 
goods;
    (2) A certified copy of the commercial invoice or bill of sale from 
the foreign supplier to the original consignee of the goods; and

unduly interfere with the entry of such articles.
    (g) Nothing in this subpart shall prevent the use of immediate 
delivery in

[[Page 287]]

accordance with the provisions of Customs regulations relating to 
tariff-rate quotas.


<R05>
Sec. 6.30  Record maintenance and inspection.

    A licensee shall retain all records relating to its purchases, sales

or transactions occurred. During that period, the licensee shall, upon 
reasonable notice and during ordinary hours of business, grant officials 
of the U.S. Department of Agriculture full and complete access to the 
licensee's premises to inspect, audit or copy such records.

Sec. 6.32  Globalization of licenses.

    If the Licensing Authority determines that entries of an article 
from a country are likely to fall short of that country's allocated 
amount as indicated in Appendices 1, 2, and 3, the Licensing Authority 
may permit, with the approval of the Office of the United States Trade 
Representative, the applicable licensees to enter the remaining balance 
or a portion thereof from any country during that quota year. Requests 
for consideration of such adjustments must be submitted to the Licensing 
Authority no later than September 1. The Licensing Authority will obtain 
prior consent for such an adjustment of licenses from the government of 
the exporting country for quantities in accordance with the Uruguay 
Round commitment of the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 6.33  License fee.

    (a) A fee will be assessed each quota year for each license to 
defray the Department's costs of administering the licensing system. To 
the extent practicable, the fee will be announced by the Licensing 
Authority in a notice published in the Federal Register no later than 
August 31 of the year preceding the quota year for which the fee is 
assessed.
    (b) The license fee for each license issued is due and payable in 
full by mail, postmarked no later than May 1 of the year for which the 
license is issued, in accordance with Sec. 6.35(b). The fee for any 
license issued after May 1 of any quota year is due and payable in full 
by mail, postmarked no later than 30 days from the date of issuance of 
the license, in accordance with Sec. 6.35(b). Fee payments shall be made 
by certified check or money order payable to the Treasurer of the United 
States.
    (c) If the license fee is not paid by the final payment date, a hold 
will be placed on the use of the license and no articles will be 
permitted entry under that license. The Licensing Authority shall send a 
warning letter by certified mail, return receipt requested, advising the 
licensee that if payment is not mailed in accordance with Sec. 6.35(b) 
or received within 21 days from the date of the letter, that the license 
will be revoked. Where the license at issue is a historical license, 
this will result, pursuant to Sec. 6.23(b), in the person's loss of 
historical eligibility for such license.
    (d) Licensees may elect not to accept certain licenses issued to 
them; however, the Licensing Authority must be so notified by mail, 
postmarked no later than the May 1, in accordance with Sec. 6.35(b).


<R05>
Sec. 6.34  Adjustment of Appendices.

    (a) Whenever a historical license (Appendix 1) is not issued to an 
applicant pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 6.23, is permanently 
surrendered or is revoked by the Licensing Authority, the amount of such 
license will be transferred to Appendix 2.
    (b) The cumulative annual transfers to Appendix 2 made in accordance 
with paragraph (a) will be published in the Federal Register. If a 
transfer results in the addition of a new article, or an article from a 
country not previously listed in Appendix 2, the Licensing Authority 
shall afford all eligible applicants for that quota year the opportunity 
to apply for a license for such article.

<R05>
Sec. 6.35  Correction of errors.

    (a) If a person demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Licensing 
Authority, that errors were made by officers or employees of the United 
States Government, the Licensing Authority will review and rectify the 
errors to the extent permitted under this subpart.
    (b) To be considered, a person must provide sufficient documentation 
regarding the error to the Licensing Authority by letter, postmarked not 
later than August 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year in 
which the error was alleged to have been committed.
    (c) If the error resulted in the loss of a historical license by a 
license holder, the Licensing Authority will transfer the amount of such 
license from Appendix 2 to Appendix 1 in order to provide for the 
issuance of such license in the calendar year following the calendar 
year for which the license was revoked. The cumulative annual transfers 
to Appendix 1 in accordance with this paragraph will be published in the 
Federal Register.

Sec. 6.43  Determinations.

    (a) Making determinations. Not later than 30 days after receiving an

undercutting, the Secretary shall make a determination as to the 
validity of the allegation. In

[[Page 294]]

making such determination, the following shall apply:
    (1) The ``domestic wholesale market'' shall be one or more of the 
three major U.S. market areas, viz., New York City, Chicago, and San 
Francisco, and/or any other market area within the Customs Territory of 
the United States, which the Investigating Authority determines most 
representative of the area specified by the complainant as the one in 
which price-undercutting is alleged to be occurring (hereinafter 
referred to as ``designated area'').
    (2) The ``duty-paid wholesale price'' determined by the 
Investigating Authority shall be the average of prices at which 
wholesalers have sold or offered for sale in the designated area the 
article of quota cheese alleged to be involved in price-undercutting, as 
obtained in a survey directed by the Investigating Authority during the 
investigation: Provided, That whenever the designated area is not or 
does not include one of the major market areas specified in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, the Investigating Authority may adjust the 
average of prices determined for such designated area on the basis of 
the average of prices determined for the major market area which is 
determined to be the most representative of the designated area, taking 
into consideration any special factors which may be affecting prices in 
the designated area.
    (3) The ``domestic wholesale market price'' determined by the 
Investigating Authority for a similar article produced in the United 
States to that article of quota cheese which is alleged to be involved 
in price-undercutting shall be the average of prices at which 
wholesalers have sold the similar article produced in the United States 
in the designated area, as obtained in a survey directed by the 
Investigating Authority during the investigation: Provided, That 
whenever the designated area is not or does not include one of the major 
market areas specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the 
Investigating Authority may adjust the average of prices determined for 
such designated area on the basis of the average of prices determined 
for the major market area which is determined to be the most 
representative of the designated area, taking into consideration any 
special factors which may be affecting prices in the designated area.
    (4) ``Similar article produced in the United States'' shall be an 
article of cheese, cheese product, or imitation cheese produced in the 
United States and marketed in the domestic wholesale market, which is 
determined by the Investigating Authority, based upon available 
information to be most like the imported article of quota cheese alleged 
to be involved in price-undercutting, in terms of its physical 
properties and end use. In making this determination, first 
consideration shall be given to the normal end uses of the article 
produced in the United States in comparison with the end use of the 
article of quota cheese alleged to be involved in price-undercutting. If 
the end use of both articles is determined to be the same (e.g., 
processing or retail sale), the physical characteristics of the two 
articles shall be considered.

If the common end use of the two articles is processing, the 
representative samples of the two articles shall be examined in terms of 
processing quality, taking special note of processing yields. If the 
common end use of the two articles is retail sale, representative 
samples of the two articles shall be examined in terms of similarities 
of taste, texture, general appearance, quality, age, and packaging. 
Imported imitation quota cheese shall only be compared with imitation 
domestic cheese. If it is determined that the domestic cheese the price 
of which is claimed to be undercut is not similar to the quota cheese 
allegedly undercutting it, there shall be no finding of price-
undercutting.
    (b) Reporting determinations. Determinations by the Secretary as to 
the validity of allegations of price-undercutting made under this 
subpart shall be published in the Federal Register not later than 5 days 
after the date the determination is made.

<R05>
Sec. 7.9  Election of community committee members, delegates to local administrative area and county conventions, and county committee members.

    (a) Where there are three local administrative areas as provided in 
Sec. 7.6 of this part there shall be an election of community committee 
members and alternates for a term of three years, or until such person's 
successor is elected and qualified, in one of the local administrative 
areas so that the term of office of the community committee members and 
alternates within one of the local administrative areas will expire each 
year.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the 
eligible voters in a community shall elect every three years a community 
committee composed of three members and shall elect first and second 
alternates to serve as acting members of the community committee in the 
order elected in case of the temporary absence of a member, or to become 
a member of the community committee in the order elected in case of the 
resignation, disqualification, removal, or death of a member. An acting 
member of the community committee shall have the same duties and the 
same authority as a regular member of such committee. The election shall 
be conducted by mail ballot in all counties, except that the Deputy 
Administrator may authorize use of the meeting or polling place method 
in a specific county where such is deemed justified. Where elections are 
by mail or by polling place, the county committee shall give advance 
public notice that nominations may be made by petition. Election shall

county conventions. A person

[[Page 298]]

may not serve as delegate if such person has been a member of the county 
committee for that county during the 90 days preceding the community 
committee election. Failure to elect the prescribed number of alternates 
at the regular election shall not invalidate such election or require a 
special election to elect additional alternates.
    (c) In any county where there is only one local administrative area, 
the community committee shall be the county committee.
    (d) Where there is only one community in the county, one committee 
person shall be elected to hold office for a term of 3 years, or until 
such person's successor is elected and qualified, so that the term of 
office of one committee member will expire in each year. There shall 
also be elected annually a first alternate and second alternate to serve 
as acting members in the order elected in case of the temporary absence 
of a member or to become a member in the order elected in the case of 
resignation, disqualification, removal, or death of a member of the 
committee. In the event an alternate fills a permanent vacancy on the 
committee, such person shall assume the office until the next election 
or until the replaced committee member's successor is elected and 
qualified. An acting member shall have the same duties and authority as 
a regular member.
    (e) In any county where there are three local administrative areas, 
the delegates elected pursuant to Sec. 7.9 (a) and (b) of this part 
shall meet in a local administrative area convention held before the 
close of the same calendar year in which they were elected to elect a 
county committee member and a first and second alternate. A first and 
second alternate shall serve as acting members of the committee in the 
order elected in case of the temporary absence of a member, or to become 
a member in the order elected in case of the resignation, 
disqualification, removal, or death of a member of the county committee. 
In the event an alternate fills a permanent vacancy on the county 
committee, such person shall assume the unexpired term of the county 
committee member who was replaced. An acting member of the county 
committee shall have the same duties and authority as a member. The 
Deputy Administrator may fix the exact convention date. Each delegate 
shall be entitled to only one vote on any ballot, and there shall be no 
voting by proxy. A majority of the delegates so elected and qualified to 
vote at the time of the convention shall constitute a quorum. Such 
convention shall be held to the extent practicable in the manner set 
forth in Sec. 7.10 of this part and in accordance with instructions 
issued by the Deputy Administrator.

<R05>
Sec. 7.10  Conduct of county convention.

    (a) The county committee serving at the time shall be responsible 
for designating the place at which the county convention will be held 
and for the conduct of the convention in accordance with instructions 
issued by the Deputy Administrator.
    (b) The delegates to the county convention shall determine which 
county committee members shall be the county committee chairperson and 
county committee vice-chairperson.
    (c) Each local administrative area shall have the same number of 
delegates at the county convention. If a portion of the delegates from a 
local administrative area are precluded from attending the county

before FSA are found in 7 CFR part 780. After receiving a decision upon 
review by a county or area committee, a participant may seek further 
informal review by the State FSA committee or may appeal directly to NAD 
under Sec. 11.6(b).
    (b) Optional informal review. With respect to adverse decisions 
issued at the State office level of FSA and adverse decisions of all 
other agencies, a participant may request an agency informal review of 
an adverse decision of that agency prior to appealing to NAD. Procedures 
for requesting such an informal review are found at 7 CFR part 780 
(FSA), 7 CFR part 614 (NRCS), 7 CFR part 1900, subpart B (RUS), 7 CFR 
part 1900, subpart B (RBS), and 7 CFR part 1900, subpart B (RHS).
    (c) Mediation. A participant also shall have the right to utilize 
any available alternative dispute resolution (ADR) or mediation program, 
including any mediation program available under title V of the 
Agricultural Credit Act of 1987, 7 U.S.C. 5101 et seq., in order to 
attempt to seek resolution of an adverse decision of an agency prior to 
a NAD hearing. If a participant:
    (1) Requests mediation or ADR prior to filing an appeal with NAD, 
the participant stops the running of the 30-day period during which a 
participant may appeal to NAD under Sec. 11.6(b)(1), and will have the 
balance of days remaining in that period to appeal to NAD once mediation 
or ADR has concluded.
    (2) Requests mediation or ADR after having filed an appeal to NAD 
under Sec. 11.6(b), but before the hearing, the participant will be 
deemed to have waived his right to have a hearing within 45 days under 
Sec. 11.8(c)(1) but shall have a right to have a hearing within 45 days 
after conclusion of mediation or ADR.


<R05>
Sec. 11.6  Director review of agency determination of appealability and right of participants to Division hearing.

    (a) Director review of agency determination of appealability. (1) 
Not later than 30 days after the date on which a participant receives a 
determination from an agency that an agency decision is not appealable, 
the participant must submit a written request personally signed by the 
participant to the Director to review the determination in order to 
obtain such review by the Director.
    (2) The Director shall determined whether the decision is adverse to 
the individual participant and thus appealable or is a matter of general 
applicability and thus not subject to appeal, and will issue a final 
determination notice that upholds or reverses the determination of the 
agency. This final determination is not appealable. If the Director 
reverses the determination of the agency, the Director will notify the 
participant and the agency of that decision and inform the participant 
of his or her right to proceed with an appeal.
    (3) The Director may delegate his or her authority to conduct a 
review under this paragraph to any subordinate official of the Division 
other than a Hearing Officer. In any case in which such review is 
conducted by such a subordinate official, the subordinate official's 
determination shall be considered to be the determination of the 
Director and shall be final and not appealable.
    (b) Appeals of adverse decisions. (1) To obtain a hearing under 
Sec. 11.8, a participant personally must request such hearing not later 
than 30 days after the date on which the participant first received 
notice of the adverse decision or after the date on which the 
participant receives notice of the Director's determination that a 
decision is appealable. In the case of the failure of an agency to act 
on the request or right of a recipient, a participant personally must

[[Page 315]]

request such hearing not later than 30 days after the participant knew 
or reasonably should have known that the agency had not acted within the 
timeframes specified by agency program regulations, or, where such 
regulations specify no timeframes, not later than 30 days after the 
participant reasonably should have known of the agency's failure to act.
    (2) A request for a hearing shall be in writing and personally 
signed by the participant, and shall include a copy of the adverse 
decision to be reviewed, if available, along with a brief statement of 
the participant's reasons for believing that the decision, or the 
agency's failure to act, was wrong. The participant also shall send a 
copy of the request for a hearing to the agency, and may send a copy of 
the adverse decision to be reviewed to the agency, but failure to do 
either will not constitute grounds for dismissal of the appeal. Instead 
of a hearing, the participant may request a record review.
    (c) If a participant is represented by an authorized representative, 
the authorized representative must file a declaration with NAD, executed 
in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1746, stating that the participant has duly 
authorized the declarant in writing to represent the participant for 
purposes of a specified adverse decision or decisions, and attach a copy 
of the written authorization to the declaration.


<R05>
Sec. 11.7  Ex parte communications.

    (a)(1) At no time between the filing of an appeal and the issuance 
of a final determination under this part shall any officer or employee 
of the Division engage in ex parte communications regarding the merits 
of the appeal with any person having any interest in the appeal pending 
before the Division, including any person in an advocacy or 
investigative capacity. This prohibition does not apply to:
    (i) Discussions of procedural matters related to an appeal; or
    (ii) Discussions of the merits of the appeal where all parties to 
the appeal have been given notice and an opportunity to participate.
    (2) In the case of a communication described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) 
of this section, a memorandum of any such discussion shall be included 
in the hearing record.
    (b) No interested person shall make or knowingly cause to be made to 
any officer or employee of the Division an ex parte communication 
relevant to the merits of the appeal.
    (c) If any officer or employee of the Division receives an ex parte 
communication in violation of this section, the one who receives the 
communication shall place in the hearing record:
    (1) All such written communications;
    (2) Memoranda stating the substance of all such oral communications; 
and
    (3) All written responses to such communications, and memoranda 
stating the substance of any oral responses thereto.
    (d) Upon receipt of a communication knowingly made or knowingly 
caused to be made by a party in violation of this section the Hearing 
Officer or Director may, to the extent consistent with the interests of 
justice and the policy of the underlying program, require the party to 
show cause why such party's claim or interest in the appeal should not 
be dismissed, denied, disregarded, or otherwise adversely affected on 
account of such violation.


<R05>
Sec. 11.8  Division hearings.

    (a) General rules. (1) The Director, the Hearing Officer, and the 
appellant shall have access to the agency record of any adverse decision 
appealed to the Division for a hearing. Upon request by the appellant, 
the agency shall provide the appellant a copy of the agency record.
    (2) The Director and Hearing Officer shall have the authority to 
administer oaths and affirmations, and to require, by subpoena, the 
attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence. A Hearing 
Officer shall obtain the concurrence of the Director prior to issuing a 
subpoena.
    (i) A subpoena requiring the production of evidence may be requested 
and issued at any time while the case is pending before the Division.
    (ii) An appellant or an agency, acting through any appropriate 
official, may request the issuance of a subpoena requiring the 
attendance of a witness by submitting such a request in writing at least 
14 days before the scheduled date of a hearing. The Director or Hearing

[[Page 316]]

Officer shall issue a subpoena at least 7 days prior to the scheduled 
date of a hearing.
    (iii) A subpoena shall be issued only if the Director or a Hearing 
Officer determined that:
    (A) For a subpoena of documents, the appellant or the agency has 
established that production of documentary evidence is necessary and is 
reasonably calculated to lead to information which would affect the 
final determination or is necessary to fully present the case before the 
Division; or
    (B) For a subpoena of a witness, the appellant or the agency has 
established that either a representative of the Department or a private 
individual possesses information that is pertinent and necessary for 
disclosure of all relevant facts which could impact the final 
determination, that the information cannot be obtained except through 
testimony of the person, and that the testimony cannot be obtained 
absent issuance of a subpoena.
    (iv) The party requesting issuance of a subpoena shall arrange for 
service. Service of a subpoena upon a person named therein may be made 
by registered or certified mail, or in person. Personal service shall be 
made by personal delivery of a copy of the subpoena to the person named 
therein by any person who is not a party and who is not less than 18 
years of age. Proof of service shall be made by filing with the Hearing 
Officer or Director who issued the subpoena a statement of the date and 
manner of service and of the names of the persons served, certified by 
the person who made the service in person or by return receipts for 
certified or registered mail.
    (v) A party who requests that a subpoena be issued shall be 
responsible for the payment of any reasonable travel and subsistence 
costs incurred by the witness in connection with his or her appearance 
and any fees of a person who serves the subpoena in person. The 
Department shall pay the costs associated with the appearance of a 
Department employee whose role as a witness arises out of his or her 
performance of official duties, regardless of which party requested the 
subpoena. The failure to make payment of such charges on demand may be 
deemed by the Hearing Officer or Director as sufficient ground for 
striking the testimony of the witness and the evidence the witness has 
produced.
    (vi) If a person refuses to obey a subpoena, the Director, acting 
through the Office of the General Counsel of the Department and the 
Department of Justice, may apply to the United States District Court in 
the jurisdiction where that person resides to have the subpoena enforced 
as provided in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C. App.).
    (3) Testimony required by subpoena pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section may, at the discretion of the Director or a Hearing 
Officer, be presented at the hearing either in person or telephonically.
    (b) Hearing procedures applicable to both record review and 
hearings. (1) Upon the filing of an appeal under this part of an adverse 
decision by any agency, the agency promptly shall provide the Division 
with a copy of the agency record. If requested by the applicant prior to 
the hearing, a copy of such agency record shall be provided to the 
appellant by the agency within 10 days of receipt of the request by the 
agency.
    (2) The Director shall assign the appeal to a Hearing Officer and 
shall notify the appellant and agency of such assignment. The notice 
also shall advise the appellant and the agency of the documents required 
to be submitted under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and notify the 
appellant of the option of having a hearing by telephone.
    (3) The Hearing Officer will receive evidence into the hearing 
record without regard to whether the evidence was known to the agency 
officer, employee, or committee making the adverse decision at the time 
the adverse decision was made.
    (c) Procedures applicable only to hearings. (1) Upon a timely 
request for a hearing under Sec. 11.6(b), an appellant has the right to 
have a hearing by the Division on any adverse decision within 45 days 
after the date of receipt of the request for the hearing by the 
Division.
    (2) The Hearing Officer shall set a reasonable deadline for 
submission of the following documents:
    (i) By the appellant;

[[Page 317]]

    (A) A short statement of why the decision is wrong;
    (B) A copy of any document not in the agency record that the 
appellant anticipates introducing at the hearing; and
    (C) A list of anticipated witnesses and brief descriptions of the 
evidence such witnesses will offer.
    (ii) By the agency:
    (A) A copy of the adverse decision challenged by the appellant;
    (B) A written explanation of the agency's position, including the 
regulatory or statutory basis therefor;
    (C) A copy of any document not in the agency record that the agency 
anticipates introducing at the hearing; and
    (D) A list of anticipated witnesses and brief descriptions of the 
evidence such witnesses will offer.
    (3) Not less than 14 days prior to the hearing, the Division must 
provide the appellant, the authorized representative, and the agency a 
notice of hearing specifying the date, time, and place of the hearing. 
The hearing will be held in the State of residence of the appellant, as 
determined by the Hearing Officer, or at a location that is otherwise 
convenient to the appellant, the agency, and the Division. The notice 
also shall notify all parties of the right to obtain an official record 
of the hearing.
    (4) Pre-hearing conference. Whenever appropriate, the Hearing 
Officer shall hold a pre-hearing conference in order to attempt to 
resolve the dispute or to narrow the issues involved. Such pre-hearing 
conference shall be held by telephone unless the Hearing Officer and all 
parties agree to hold such conference in person.
    (5) Conduct of the hearing. (i) A hearing before a Hearing Officer 
will be in person unless the appellant agrees to a hearing by telephone.
    (ii) The hearing will be conducted by the Hearing Officer in the 
manner determined by the Division most likely to obtain the facts 
relevant to the matter or matters at issue. The Hearing Officer will 
allow the presentation of evidence at the hearing by any party without 
regard to whether the evidence was known to the officer, employee, or 
committee of the agency making the adverse decision at the time the 
adverse decision was made. The Hearing Officer may confine the 
presentation of facts and evidence to pertinent matters and exclude 
irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence, information, or 
questions. Any party shall have the opportunity to present oral and 
documentary evidence, oral testimony of witnesses, and arguments in 
support of the party's position; controvert evidence relied on by any 
other party; and question all witnesses. When appropriate, agency 
witnesses requested by the appellant will be made available at the 
hearing. Any evidence may be received by the Hearing Officer without 
regard to whether that evidence could be admitted in judicial 
proceedings.
    (iii) An official record shall be made of the proceedings of every 
hearing. This record will be made by an official tape recording by the 
Division. In addition, either party may request that a verbatim 
transcript be made of the hearing proceedings and that such transcript 
shall be made the official record of the hearing. The party requesting a 
verbatim transcript shall pay for the transcription service, shall 
provide a certified copy of the transcript to the Hearing Officer free 
of charge, and shall allow any other party desiring to purchase a copy 
of the transcript to order it from the transcription service.
    (6) Absence of parties. (i) If at the time scheduled for the hearing 
either the appellant or the agency representative is absent, and no 
appearance is made on behalf of such absent party, or no arrangements 
have been made for rescheduling the hearing, the Hearing Officer has the 
option to cancel the hearing unless the absent party has good cause for 
the failure to appear. If the Hearing Officer elects to cancel the 
hearing, the Hearing Officer may:
    (A) Treat the appeal as a record review and issue a determination 
based on the agency record as submitted by the agency and the hearing 
record developed prior to the hearing date;
    (B) Accept evidence into the hearing record submitted by any party 
present at the hearing (subject to paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this 
section), and then issue a determination; or
    (C) Dismiss the appeal.

[[Page 318]]

    (ii) When a hearing is cancelled due to the absence of a party, the 
Hearing Officer will add to the hearing record any additional evidence 
submitted by any party present, provide a copy of such evidence to the 
absent party or parties, and allow the absent party or parties 10 days 
to provide a response to such additional evidence for inclusion in the 
hearing record
    (iii) Where an absent party has demonstrated good cause for the 
failure to appear, the Hearing Officer shall reschedule the hearing 
unless all parties agree to proceed without a hearing.
    (7) Post-hearing procedure. The Hearing Officer will leave the 
hearing record open after the hearing for 10 days, or for such other 
period of time as the Hearing Officer shall establish, to allow the 
submission of information by the appellant or the agency, to the extent 
necessary to respond to new facts, information, arguments, or evidence 
presented or raised at the hearing. Any such new information will be 
added by the Hearing Office to the hearing record and sent to the other 
party or parties by the submitter of the information. The Hearing 
Officer, in his or her discretion, may permit the other party or parties 
to respond to this post-hearing submission.
    (d) Interlocutory review. Interlocutory review by the Director of 
rulings of a Hearing Officer are not permitted under the procedures of 
this part.
    (e) Burden of proof. The appellant has the burden of proving that 
the adverse decision of the agency was erroneous by a preponderance of 
the evidence.
    (f) Timing of issuance of determination. The Hearing Officer will 
issue a notice of the determination on the appeal to the named 
appellant, the authorized representative, and the agency not later than 
30 days after a hearing or the closing date of the hearing record in 
cases in which the Hearing Officer receives additional evidence from the 
agency or appellant after a hearing. In the case of a record review, the 
Hearing Officer will issue a notice of determination within 45 days of 
receipt of the appellant's request for a record review. Upon the Hearing 
Officer's request, the Director may establish an earlier or later 
deadline. A notice of determination shall be accompanied by a copy of 
the procedures for filing a request for Director review under Sec. 11.9. 
If the determination is not appealed to the Director for review under 
Sec. 11.9, the notice provided by the Hearing Officer shall be 
considered to be a notice of a final determination under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 11.9  Director review of determinations of Hearing Officers.

    (a) Requests for Director review. (1) Not later than 30 days after 
the date on which an appellant receives the determination of a Hearing 
Officer under Sec. 11.8, the appellant must submit a written request, 
signed personally by the named appellant, to the Director to review the 
determination in order to be entitled to such review by the Director. 
Such request shall include specific reasons why the appellant believes 
the determination is wrong.
    (2) Not later than 15 business days after the date on which an 
agency receives the determination of a Hearing Officer under Sec. 11.8, 
the head of the agency may make a written request that the Director 
review the determination. Such request shall include specific reasons 
why the agency believes the determination is wrong, including citations 
of statutes or regulations that the agency believes the determination 
violates. Any such request may be made by the head of an agency only, or 
by a person acting in such capacity, but not by any subordinate officer 
of such agency.
    (3) A copy of a request for Director review submitted under this 
paragraph shall be provided simultaneously by the submitter to each 
party to the appeal.
    (b) Notification of parties. The Director promptly shall notify all 
parties of receipt of a request for review.
    (c) Responses to request for Director review. Other parties to an 
appeal may submit written responses to a request for Director review 
within 5 business days from the date of receipt of a copy of the request 
for review.
    (d) Determination of Director. (1) The Director will conduct a 
review of the determination of the Hearing Officer using the agency 
record, the hearing record, the request for review, any responses 
submitted under paragraph (c)

[[Page 319]]

of this section, and such other arguments or information as may be 
accepted by the Director, in order to determine whether the decision of 
the Hearing Officer is supported by substantial evidence. Based on such 
review, the Director will issue a final determination notice that 
upholds, reverses, or modifies the determination of the Hearing Officer. 
The Director's determination upon review of a Hearing Officer's decision 
shall be considered to be the final determination under this part and 
shall not be appealable. However, if the Director determines that the 
hearing record is inadequate or that new evidence has been submitted, 
the Director may remand all or a portion of the determination to the 
Hearing Officer for further proceedings to complete the hearing record 
or, at the option of the Director, to hold a new hearing.
    (2) The Director will complete the review and either issue a final 
determination or remand the determination not later than--
    (i) 10 business days after receipt of the request for review, in the 
case of a request by the head of an agency; or
    (ii) 30 business days after receipt of the request for review, in 
the case of a request by an appellant.
    (3) In any case or any category of cases, the Director may delegate 
his or her authority to conduct a review under this section to any 
Deputy or Assistant Directors of the Division. In any case in which such 
review is conducted by a Deputy or Assistant Director under authority 
delegated by the Director, the Deputy or Assistant Director's 
determination shall be considered to be the determination of the 
Director under this part and shall be final and not appealable.
    (e) Equitable relief. In reaching a decision on an appeal, the 
Director shall have the authority to grant equitable relief under this 
part in the same manner and to the same extent as such authority is 
provided an agency under applicable laws and regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 11.10  Basis for determinations.

    (a) In making a determination, the Hearing Officers and the Director 
are not bound by previous findings of facts on which the agency's 
adverse decision was based.
    (b) In making a determination on the appeal, Hearing Officers and 
the Director shall ensure that the decision is consistent with the laws 
and regulations of the agency, and with the generally applicable 
interpretations of such laws and regulations.
    (c) All determinations of the Hearing Officers and the Director must 
be based on information from the case record, laws applicable to the 
matter at issue, and applicable regulations published in the Federal 
Register and in effect on the date of the adverse decision or the date 
on which the acts that gave rise to the adverse decision occurred, 
whichever date is appropriate under the applicable agency program laws 
and regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 11.11  Reconsideration of Director determinations.

    (a) Reconsideration of a determination of the Director may be 
requested by the appellant or the agency within 10 days of receipt of 
the determination. The Director will not consider any request for 
reconsideration that does not contain a detailed statement of a material 
error of fact made in the determination, or a detailed explanation of 
how the determination is contrary to statute or regulation, which would 
justify reversal or modification of the determination.
    (b) The Director shall issue a notice to all parties as to whether a 
request for reconsideration meets the criteria in paragraph (a) of this 
section. If the request for reconsideration meets such criteria, the 
Director shall include a copy of the request for reconsideration in the 
notice to the non-requesting parties to the appeal. The non-requesting 
parties shall have 5 days from receipt of such notice from the Director 
to file a response to the request for reconsideration with the Director.
    (c) The Director shall issue a decision on the request for 
reconsideration within 5 days of receipt of responses from the non-
requesting parties. If the Director's decision upon reconsideration 
reverses or modifies the final determination of the Director rendered 
under Sec. 11.9(d), the Director's decision on reconsideration will 
become the

[[Page 320]]

final determination of the Director under Sec. 11.9(d) for purposes of 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 11.12  Effective date and implementation of final determinations of the Division.

    (a) On the return of a case to an agency pursuant to the final 
determination of the Division, the head of the agency shall implement 
the final determination not later than 30 days after the effective date 
of the notice of the final determination.
    (b) A final determination will be effective as of the date of filing 
of an application, the date of the transaction or event in question, or 
the date of the original adverse decision, whichever is applicable under 
the applicable agency program statutes or regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 11.13  Judicial review.

    (a) A final determination of the Division shall be reviewable and 
enforceable by any United States District Court of competent 
jurisdiction in accordance with chapter 7 of title 5, United States 
Code.
    (b) An appellant may not seek judicial review of any agency adverse 
decision appealable under this part without receiving a final 
determination from the Division pursuant to the procedures of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 11.14  Filing of appeals and computation of time.

    (a) An appeal, a request for Director Review, or any other document 
will be considered ``filed'' when delivered in writing to the Division, 
when postmarked, or when a complete facsimile copy is received by the 
Division.
    (b) Whenever the final date for any requirement of this part falls 
on a Saturday, Sunday, Federal holiday, or other day on which the 
Division is not open for the transaction of business during normal 
working hours, the time for filing will be extended to the close of 
business on the next working day.
    (c) The time for filing an appeal, a request for Director review, or 
any other document expires at 5:00 p.m. local time at the office of the 
Division to which the filing is submitted on the last day on which such 
filing may be made.


<R05>
Sec. 11.15  Participation of third parties and interested parties in Division proceedings.

    In two situations, parties other than the appellant or the agency 
may be interested in participating in Division proceedings. In the first 
situation, a Division proceeding may in fact result in the adjudication 
of the rights of a third party, e.g., an appeal of a tenant involving a 
payment shared with a landlord, an appeal by one recipient of a portion 
of a payment shared by multiple parties, an appeal by one heir of an 
estate. In the second situation, a party may desire to receive notice of 
and perhaps participate in an appeal because of the derivative impact 
the appeal determination will have on that party, e.g., guaranteed 
lenders and reinsurance companies. The provisions in this section set 
forth rules for the participation of such third and interested parties.
    (a) Third parties. When an appeal is filed, the Division shall 
notify any potential third party whose rights may be adjudicated of its 
right to participate as an appellant in the appeal. This includes the 
right to seek Director review of the Hearing Officer determination. Such 
third parties may be identified by the Division itself, by an agency, or 
by the original appellant. The Division shall issue one notice to the 
third party of its right to participate, and if such party declines to 
participate, the Division determination will be binding as to that third 
party as if it had participated. For purposes of this part, a third 
party includes any party for which a determination of the Division could 
lead to an agency action on implementation that would be adverse to the 
party thus giving such party a right to a Division appeal.
    (b) Interested parties. With respect to a participant who is a 
borrower under a guaranteed loan or an insured under a crop insurance 
program, the respective guaranteed lender or reinsurance company having 
an interest in a participant's appeal under this part may participate in 
the appeal as an interested party, but such participation does not 
confer the status of an appellant upon the guaranteed lender or 
reinsurance

[[Page 321]]

company such that it may request Director review of a final 
determination of the Division.

Sec. 11.30  General statement.

    This subpart implements the regulations of the Secretary of 
Agriculture at 7 CFR 1.1 through 1.16 concerning FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552). 
The Secretary's regulations, as implemented by the regulations in this 
part, govern the availability of the records of NAD to the public.


<R05>
Sec. 11.31  Public inspection and copying.

    Section 1.5 of this title requires that certain materials be made 
available by each USDA agency for public inspection and copying in 
accordance with 5 U.S.C. 522(a)(2). Members of the public wishing to 
gain access to these NAD records should write to the appropriate address 
shown in Appendix A of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 11.32  Initial requests for records.

    (a) Requests for NAD records should be in writing and addressed to 
the NAD official having custody of the records desired as indicated in 
Sec. 11.22(d). Addresses are found in Appendix A of this subpart. In his 
or her petition, the requester may ask for a fee waiver if there is 
likely to be a charge for the requested information. The criteria for 
waiver of fees are found in section 6 of appendix A, subpart A of part 1 
of this

title. All requests for records shall be deemed to have been made 
pursuant to FOIA, regardless of whether FOIA is specifically mentioned. 
To facilitate processing of a request, the phrase ``FOIA REQUEST'' 
should be placed in capital letters on the front of the envelope.
    (b) A request must reasonably describe records to enable NAD 
personnel to locate them with reasonable effort. Where possible, a 
requester should supply specific information, such as dates, titles, 
appellant name or appeal number, that may help identify the records. If 
the request relates to a matter in pending litigation, the court and its 
location should be identified.
    (c) If NAD determines that a request does not reasonably describe 
the records, it shall inform the requester of this fact and extend the 
requester an opportunity to clarify the request or to confer promptly 
with knowledgeable NAD personnel to attempt to identify the records he 
or she is seeking. The ``date of receipt'' in such instances, for 
purposes of Sec. 1.12(a) of this title, shall be the date of receipt of 
the amended or clarified request.
    (d) Nothing in this subpart shall be interpreted to preclude NAD 
from honoring an oral request for information, but if the requester is 
dissatisfied with the response, the NAD official involved shall advise 
the requester to submit a written request in accordance with paragraph 
(a) of this section. The ``date of receipt'' of such a request for 
purposes of Sec. 1.12(a) of this title shall be the date of receipt of 
the written request. For recordkeeping purposes, the NAD official 
responding to an oral request for information may ask the requester to 
also submit his or her request in writing.
    (e) If a request for records or a fee waiver under this subpart is 
denied, the person making the request shall have the right to appeal the 
denial. Requesters also may appeal NAD decisions regarding a requester's 
status for purposes of fee levels under section 5 of Appendix A, subpart 
A of part 1 of this title. All appeals must be in writing and addressed 
to the official designated in Sec. 11.33. To facilitate processing of an 
appeal, the phrase ``FOIA APPEAL'' should be placed in capital letters 
on the front of the envelope.
    (f) NAD shall develop and maintain a record of all written and oral 
FOIA requests and FOIA appeals received by NAD, which shall include, in 
addition to any other information, the name of the requester, brief 
summary of the information requested, an indication of whether the 
request or appeal was denied or partially denied, the FOIA exemption(s) 
cited as the basis for any denials, and the amount of fees associated 
with the request or appeal.

remove certain incentives for persons to produce agricultural 
commodities on highly erodible land or converted wetland and to 
thereby--
    (1) Reduce soil loss due to wind and water erosion;
    (2) Protect the Nation's long-term capability to produce food and 
fiber;
    (3) Reduce sedimentation and improve water quality; and
    (4) Assist in preserving the functions and values of the Nation's 
wetlands.

the crops or proceeds therefrom. A tenant shall not be considered the 
farm operator unless the tenant is determined to be the operator 
pursuant to this part and 7 CFR part 718.
    Wetland, except when such term is a part of the term ``converted 
wetland'', means land that--
    (1) Has predominance of hydric soils;
    (2) Is inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a 
frequency and duration sufficient to support a prevalence of hydrophytic 
vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions; and

effect of making possible the production of an agricultural commodity 
without further application of the manipulations described herein if:
    (i) Such production would not have been possible but for such 
action, and
    (ii) Before such action such land was wetland, farmed wetland, or 
farmed-wetland pasture and was neither highly erodible land nor highly 
erodible cropland;
    (4) Farmed wetland is a wetland that prior to December 23, 1985, was 
manipulated and used to produce an agricultural commodity, and on 
December 23, 1985, did not support woody vegetation and met the

    (i) Land that under natural conditions does not meet wetland 
criteria, or
    (ii) Is converted wetland the conversion of which occurred prior to 
December 23, 1985, and on that date, the land did not meet wetland 
criteria but an agricultural commodity was not produced and the area was 
not managed for pasture or hay;
    (8) Prior-converted cropland is a converted wetland where the 
conversion occurred prior to December 23, 1985, an agricultural 
commodity had been produced at least once before December 23, 1985, and 
as of December 23, 1985, the converted wetland did not support woody 
vegetation and met the following hydrologic criteria:
    (i) Inundation was less than 15 consecutive days during the growing 
season or 10 percent of the growing season, whichever is less, in most 
years (50 percent chance or more); and

    (9) Wetland, as defined above in this section.
    Wetland delineation means outlining the boundaries of a wetland 
determination on aerial photography, digital imagery, other graphic 
representation of the area, or on the land.
    (b) Terms for FSA operations. In the regulations in this part, and 
in all instructions, forms, and documents in connection therewith, all 
other words and phrases specifically relating to FSA operations shall, 
unless required by the subject matter or the specific provisions of this

Sec. 12.3  Applicability.

    (a) Geographic scope. The provisions of this part shall apply to all 
land, including Indian tribal land, in the fifty States, the District of 
Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Island of 
the United States, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern 
Mariana Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of 
Palau, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands.
    (b) Effective date. The provisions of this part apply to all actions 
taken after July 3, 1996, and to determinations made after or pending on 
July 3, 1996, except to the extent that Sec. 12.5(a)(5) and 12.5 (b)(4) 
through (b)(8) specify retroactive application on December 23, 1985, and 
November 28, 1990, for certain actions and determinations regarding 
wetlands and converted wetlands. Actions taken and determinations made 
prior to July 3, 1996, are subject to regulations set forth in this part 
as of July 2, 1996, except as otherwise provided in this part. Further, 
to the extent that a person may be eligible for an exemption for an 
action taken before July 3, 1996, the action is subject to the 
provisions of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 12.4  Determination of ineligibility.

    (a) Actions. Except as provided in Sec. 12.5, a person shall be 
ineligible for all or a portion of USDA program benefits listed in this 
section if:
    (1) The person produces an agricultural commodity on a field in 
which highly erodible land is predominant, or designates such a field 
for conservation use;
    (2) The person produces an agricultural commodity on wetland that 
was converted after December 23, 1985; or
    (3) After November 28, 1990, the person converts a wetland by 
draining, dredging, filling, leveling, removing woody vegetation, or 
other means for

[[Page 327]]

the purpose, or to have the effect, of making the production of an 
agricultural commodity possible.
    (b) Highly erodible land. A person determined to be ineligible under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be ineligible for all program 
benefits listed in (d) and (e) of this section.
    (c) Wetland conservation. A person determined to be ineligible under 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall be ineligible for all or a 
portion of the USDA program benefits listed in paragraph (d) of this 
section for which the person otherwise would have been eligible during 
the crop year of the commodity that was planted on the converted 
wetland. A person determined to be ineligible under paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section for the conversion of a wetland shall be ineligible for all 
or a portion of the USDA program benefits listed in paragraph (d) of 
this section for which the person otherwise would have been eligible 
during the crop year which is equal to the calendar year during which 
the violation occurred and each subsequent crop year until the converted 
wetland is restored or the loss of wetland functions and values have 
been mitigated prior to the beginning of such calendar year in 
accordance with Sec. 12.5(b)(4)(i) (A) and (C) through (F) of this part. 
Ineligibility under paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section may be 
reduced, in lieu of the loss of all benefits specified under paragraph 
(d) of this section for such crop year, based on the seriousness of the 
violation, as determined by the FSA Deputy Administrator for Farm 
Programs or designee upon recommendation by the FSA County Committee. 
Factors such as the information that was available to the affected 
person prior to the violation, previous land use patterns, the existence 
of previous wetland violations under this part or under other Federal, 
State, or local wetland provisions, the wetland functions and values 
affected, the recovery time for full mitigation of the wetland functions 
and values, and the impact that a reduction in payments would have on 
the person's ability to repay a USDA farm loan shall be considered to 
making this determination.
    (d) Programs subject to either highly erodible land or wetland 
conservation. USDA program benefits covered by a determination of 
ineligibility under this rule are:
    (1) Contract payments under a production flexibility contract, 
marketing assistance loans, and any type of price support or payment 
made available under the Agricultural Market Transition Act, the 
Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act (15 U.S.C. 714 et seq.), or any 
other Act;
    (2) A farm credit program loan made or guaranteed under the 
Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1921 et seq.) or 
any other provision of law administered by FSA if the Secretary 
determines that the proceeds of such loan will be used for a purpose 
that contributes to the conversion of wetlands that would make 
production of an agricultural commodity possible or for a purpose that 
contributes to excessive erosion of highly erodible land (i.e., 
production of an agricultural commodity or highly erodible land without 
a conservation plan or conservation system as required by this part);
    (3) A payment made pursuant to a contract entered into under the 
Environmental Quality Incentives Program under chapter 4 of subtitle D 
of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended; or a payment under any 
other provision of Subtitle D of that Act;
    (4) A payment made under section 401 or 402 of the Agricultural 
Credit Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2201 or 2202);
    (5) A payment, loan, or other assistance under section 3 or 8 of the 
Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act (16 U.S.C. 1003 or 1006a).
    (e) Programs subject to highly erodible land only. In addition to 
programs listed in paragraph (d) of this section, a person determined to 
be ineligible under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be ineligible 
as determined by FSA for the following USDA program benefits for which 
the person otherwise would have been eligible during the crop year for 
which the determination applies:
    (1) A farm storage facility loan made under section 4(h) of the 
Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act (15 U.S.C. 714b(h));
    (2) A disaster payment made under the Federal Agricultural 
Improvement

[[Page 328]]

and Reform Act, Pub. L. 104-127, or any other act; and
    (3) A payment made under section 4 or 5 of the Commodity Credit 
Corporation Charter Act (15 U.S.C. 714b or 714c) for the storage of an 
agricultural commodity acquired by the Commodity Credit Corporation.
    (f) Prior loans. The provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of 
this section do not apply to any loan described in paragraphs (d) or (e) 
of this section that was made prior to December 23, 1985.
    (g) Determination of ineligibility. For the purpose of paragraph (a) 
of this section, a person shall be determined to have produced an 
agricultural commodity on a field in which highly erodible land is 
predominant or to have designated such a field for conservation use, to 
have produced an agricultural commodity on converted wetland, or to have 
converted a wetland if:
    (1) NRCS has determined that--
    (i) Highly erodible land is predominant in such field, or
    (ii) All or a portion of the field is converted wetland; and
    (2) FSA has determined that the person is or was the owner or 
operator of the land, or entitled to share in the crops available from 
the land, or in the proceeds thereof; and
    (3) With regard to the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) and (a)(2) of 
this section, FSA has determined that the land is or was planted to an 
agricultural commodity or was designated as conservation use during the 
year for which the person is requesting benefits.
    (h) Intent to participate in USDA programs. Persons who wish to 
participate in any of the USDA programs described in paragraph (d) or 
(e) of this section are responsible for contacting the appropriate 
agency of USDA well in advance of the intended participated date so that 
Form AD-1026 can be completed. This contact will help assure that the 
appropriate determinations regarding highly erodible land or wetland, 
and conservation plans or conservation systems are scheduled in a timely 
manner. A late contact may not allow sufficient time for USDA to service 
the request and could result in a substantial delay in receiving a USDA 
determination of eligibility or ineligibility.

on any highly erodible land:
    (i) That was planted to an agricultural commodity in any year 1981 
through 1985; or
    (ii) That was set aside, diverted, or otherwise not cultivated in 
any such crop years under a program administered by the Secretary for 
any such crops to reduce production of an agricultural commodity.
    (2) Compliance with a conservation plan or conservation system. As 
further specified in this part, no person shall be ineligible for the 
program benefits described in Sec. 12.4 as the result of production of 
an agricultural commodity on highly erodible land or the designation of 
such land for conservation use if such production or designation is in 
compliance with a conservation plan or conservation system approved 
under paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (a)(2)(ii) of this section. A person shall 
not be ineligible for program benefits under Sec. 12.4 as the result of 
the production of an agricultural commodity on highly erodible land or 
as the result of designation of such land as conservation use if the 
production or designation is:
    (i) In an area within a CD, under a conservation system that has 
been approved by the CD after the CD determines that the conservation 
system is in conformity with technical standards set forth in the NRCS 
field office technical guide for such district; or
    (ii) In an area not within a CD, under a conservation system that 
has been approved by NRCS to be adequate for

[[Page 329]]

the production of such agricultural commodity on highly erodible land or 
for the designation of such land as conservation use.
    (3) Reliance upon NRCS determination for highly erodible land. A 
person may be relieved from ineligibility for program benefits as the 
result of the production of an agricultural commodity which was produced 
on highly erodible land or for the designation of such land as 
conservation use in reliance on a determination by NRCS that such land 
was not highly erodible land, except that this paragraph shall not apply 
to any agricultural commodity that was planted on highly erodible land, 
or for the designation of highly erodible land as conservation use after 
NRCS determines that such land is highly erodible land, and the person 
is notified of such determinations.
    (4) Areas of 2 acres or less. No person shall be determined to be 
ineligible under Sec. 12.4 for noncommercial production of agricultural 
commodities on highly erodible land on an area of 2 acres or less if it 
is determined by FSA that such production is not intended to circumvent 
the conservation requirements otherwise applicable under this part.
    (5) Good faith. (i) No person shall become ineligible under 
Sec. 12.4 as a result of the failure of such person to apply a 
conservation system on highly erodible land that was converted from 
native vegetation, i.e. rangeland or woodland, to crop production before 
December 23, 1985, if FSA determines such person has acted in good faith 
and without the intent to violate the provisions of this part and if 
NRCS determines that the person complies with paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of 
this section.
    (ii) A person is who determined to meet the requirements of 
paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section shall be allowed a reasonable period 
of time, as determined by NRCS, but not to exceed one year, during which 
to implement the measures and practices necessary to be considered 
applying the person's conservation plan. If a person does not take the 
required corrective actions, the person may be determined to be 
ineligible for the crop year during which such actions were to be taken 
as well as any subsequent crop years. Notwithstanding the good-faith 
requirements of paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, if NRCS observes a 
possible compliance deficiency while providing on-site technical 
assistance, NRCS shall provide to the responsible person, not later than 
45 days after observing the possible violation, information regarding 
actions needed to comply with the plan and this subtitle. NRCS shall 
provide this information in lieu of reporting the observation as a 
violation, if the responsible person attempts to correct the 
deficiencies as soon as practicable, as determined by NRCS, after 
receiving the information, and if the person takes corrective action as 
directed by NRCS not later than one year after receiving the 
information. If a person does not take the required corrective actions, 
the person may be determined to be ineligible for the crop year during 
which the compliance deficiencies occurred as well as any subsequent 
crop years.
    (iii) No person shall become ineligible under Sec. 12.4 as a result 
of failure to apply a conservation system with respect to highly 
erodible cropland that was converted from native vegetation, i.e., 
rangeland or woodland, to crop production after December 23, 1985, if 
such person has acted in good faith and without an intent to violate the 
provisions of this part. The person shall, in lieu of the loss of all 
benefits specified under Sec. 12.4 (d) and (e) for such crop year, be 
subject to a reduction in benefits of not less than $500 nor more than 
$5,000 depending upon the seriousness of the violation, as determined by 
FSA. The dollar amount of the reduction will be determined by FSA and 
may be based on the number of acres and the degree of erosion hazard for 
the area in violation, as determined by NRCS, or upon such other factors 
as FSA deems appropriate.
    (iv) Any person whose benefits are reduced in a crop year under 
paragraph (a)(5) of this section may be eligible for all of the benefits 
specified under Sec. 12.4 (d) and (e) for any subsequent crop year if 
NRCS determines that such person is applying a conservation plan 
according to the schedule set forth in the plan on all highly erodible 
land planted to an agricultural commodity or designated as conservation 
use.

[[Page 330]]

    (6) Allowable variances. (i) Notwithstanding any other provisions of 
this part, no person shall be determined to be ineligible for benefits 
as a result of the failure of such person to apply a conservation system 
if NRCS determines that--
    (A) The failure is technical and minor in nature and that such 
violation has little effect on the erosion control purposes of the 
conservation plan applicable to the land on which the violation has 
occurred; or
    (B) The failure is due to circumstances beyond the control of the 
person; or
    (C) NRCS grants a temporary variance from the practices specified in 
the plan for the purpose of handling a specific problem, including 
weather, pest, and disease problems, which NRCS determines cannot 
reasonably be addressed except through such variance.
    (ii) If the person's request for a temporary variance involves the 
use of practices or measures to address weather, pest, or disease 
problems, NRCS shall make a decision on whether to grant the variance 
during the 30-day period beginning on the date of receipt of the 
request. If NRCS fails to render a decision during the period, the 
temporary variance shall be considered granted unless the person seeking 
the variance had reason to know that the variance would not be granted. 
In determining whether to grant a variance for natural disasters such as 
weather, pest, or disease problems, NRCS will consider such factors as:
    (A) The percent of a stand damaged or destroyed by the event;
    (B) The percent of expected crop production compared to normal 
production for that crop;
    (C) The documented invasion of non-native insects, weeds, or 
diseases for which no recognized treatment exists;
    (D) Whether an event is severe or unusual based on historical 
weather records; and
    (E) Other specific circumstances caused by a natural event that 
prevented the implementation of conservation practices or systems, 
installation of structures, or planting of cover crops.
    (b) Exemptions for wetlands and converted wetlands--(1) General 
exemptions. A person shall not be determined to be ineligible for 
program benefits under Sec. 12.4 as the result of the production of an 
agricultural commodity on converted wetland or the conversion of wetland 
if:
    (i) The land is a prior-converted cropland and meets the definition 
of a prior-converted cropland as of the date of a wetland determination 
by NRCS;
    (ii) The land has been determined by NRCS to be a prior-converted 
cropland and such determination has been certified, and NRCS determines 
that the wetland characteristics returned after the date of the wetland 
certification as a result of--
    (A) The lack of maintenance of drainage, dikes, levees, or similar 
structures,
    (B) The lack of management of the lands containing the wetland, or
    (C) Circumstances beyond the control of the person;
    (iii) The land was determined by NRCS to be a farmed wetland or a 
farmed-wetland pasture and--
    (A) Such land meets wetland criteria through a voluntary 
restoration, enhancement, or creation action after that determination,
    (B) The technical determinations regarding the baseline site 
conditions and the restoration, enhancement, or creation action have 
been adequately documented by NRCS,
    (C) The proposed conversion action is documented by the NRCS prior 
to implementation, and
    (D) The extent of the proposed conversion is limited so that the 
conditions will be at least equivalent to the wetland functions and 
values that existed at the time of implementation of the voluntary 
wetland restoration, enhancement, or creation action;
    (iv) NRCS has determined that the conversion if for a purpose that 
does not make the production of an agricultural commodity possible, such 
as conversions for fish production, trees, vineyards, shrubs, 
cranberries, agricultural waste management structures, livestock ponds, 
fire control, or building and road construction and no agricultural 
commodity is produced on such land;
    (v) NRCS has determined that the actions of the person with respect 
to the

[[Page 331]]

conversion of the wetland or the combined effect of the production of an 
agricultural commodity on a wetland converted by the person or by 
someone else, individually and in connection with all other similar 
actions authorized by NRCS in the area, would have only a minimal effect 
on the wetland functions and values of wetlands in the area;
    (vi)(A) After December 23, 1985, the Army Corps of Engineers issued 
an individual permit pursuant to section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 
U.S.C. 1344, authorizing such action and the permit required mitigation 
that adequately replaced the functions and values of the wetlands 
converted, as determined by NRCS, or
    (B) After December 23, 1985, the action is encompassed under section 
404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1344, by an Army Corps of 
Engineers nationwide or regional general permit and the wetland 
functions and values were adequately mitigated, as determined by NRCS; 
or
    (vii) The land is determined by NRCS to be--
    (A) An artificial wetland,
    (B) A wet area created by a water delivery system, irrigation, 
irrigation system, or application of water for irrigation,
    (C) A nontidal drainage or irrigation ditch excavated in non-
wetland, or
    (D) A wetland converted by actions of persons other than the person 
applying for USDA program benefits or any of the person's predecessors 
in interest after December 23, 1985, if such conversion was not the 
result of a scheme or device to avoid compliance with this part. Further 
drainage improvement on such land is not permitted without loss of 
eligibility for USDA program benefits, unless NRCS determines under 
paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section that further drainage activities 
applied to such land would have minimal effect on the wetland functions 
and values in the area. In applying this paragraph, a converted wetland 
shall be presumed to have been converted by the person applying for USDA 
program benefits unless the person can show that the conversion was 
caused by a third party with whom the person was not associated through 
a scheme or device as described under Sec. 12.10 of this part. In this 
regard, activities of a water resource district, drainage district, or 
similar entity will be attributed to all persons within the jurisdiction 
of the district or other entity who are assessed for the activities of 
the district or entity. Accordingly, where a person's wetland is 
converted due to the actions of the district or entity, the person shall 
be considered to have caused or permitted the drainage. Notwithstanding 
the provisions of the preceding sentences and as determined by FSA to be 
consistent with the purposes of this part, the activities of a drainage 
district or other similar entity will not be attributed to a person to 
the extent that the activities of the district or entity were beyond the 
control of the person and the wetland converted is not used by the 
person for the production of an agricultural commodity or a forage crop 
for harvest by mechanical means or mitigation for the converted wetland 
occurs in accordance with this part.
    (2) Commenced conversion wetlands. (i) The purpose of a 
determination of a commenced conversion made under this paragraph is to 
implement the legislative intent that those persons who had actually 
started conversion of a wetland or obligated funds for conversion prior 
to December 23, 1985, would be allowed to complete the conversion so as 
to avoid unnecessary economic hardship.
    (ii) All persons who believed they had a wetland or converted 
wetland for which conversion began but was not completed prior to 
December 23, 1985, must have requested by September 19, 1988, FSA to 
make a determination of commencement in order to be considered exempt 
under this section.
    (iii) Any conversion activity considered by FSA to be commenced 
under this section lost its exempt status if such activity as not 
completed on or before January 1, 1995. For purposes of this part, land 
on which such conversion activities were completed by January 1, 1995, 
shall be evaluated by the same standards and qualify for the same 
exemptions as prior-converted croplands. For purposes of this part, land 
on which such conversion activities were not completed by January 1, 
1995, shall be evaluated by the same

[[Page 332]]

standards and qualify for the same exemptions as wetlands or farmed 
wetlands, as applicable.
    (iv) Only those wetlands for which the construction had begun, or to 
which the contract or purchased supplies and materials related, 
qualified for a determination of commencement. However, in those 
circumstances where the conversion of wetland did not meet the specific 
requirements of this paragraph, the person could have requested a 
commencement of conversion determination from the FSA Deputy 
Administrator for Farm Programs, upon a showing that undue economic 
hardship would have resulted because of substantial financial 
obligations incurred prior to December 23, 1985, for the primary and 
direct purpose of converting the wetland.
    (3) Wetlands farmed under natural conditions. A person shall not be 
determined to be ineligible for program benefits under Sec. 12.4 of this 
part as a result of the production of an agricultural commodity on a 
wetland on which the owner or operator of a farm or ranch uses normal 
cropping or ranching practices to produce agricultural commodities in a 
manner that is consistent for the area, where such production is 
possible as a result of natural conditions, such as drought, and is 
without action by the producer that alters the hydrology or removes 
woody vegetation.
    (4) Mitigation. (i) No person shall be determined to be ineligible 
under Sec. 12.4 for any action associated with the conversion of a 
wetland if the wetland functions and values are adequately mitigated, as 
determined by NRCS, through the restoration of a converted wetland, the 
enhancement of an existing wetland, or the creation of a new wetland, if 
the mitigation--
    (A) Is in accordance with a mitigation plan approved by NRCS;
    (B) Is in advance of, or concurrent with, the wetland conversion or 
the production of an agricultural commodity, as applicable;
    (C) Is not at the expense of the federal government in either 
supporting the direct or indirect costs of the restoration activity or 
costs associated with acquiring or securing mitigation sites, except if 
conducted under a mitigation banking pilot program established by USDA;
    (D) Occurs on lands in the same general area of the local watershed 
as the converted wetlands, provided that for purposes of this paragraph, 
lands in the same general area of the local watershed may include 
regional mitigation banks;
    (E) Is on lands for which the owner has granted an easement to USDA, 
recorded the easement on public land records, and has agreed to the 
maintenance of the restored, created, or enhanced wetland for as long as 
the converted wetland for which the mitigation occurred remains in 
agricultural use or is not returned to its original wetland 
classification with equivalent functions and values; and
    (F) Provides the equivalent functions and values that will be lost 
as a result of the wetland conversion.
    (ii) A mitigation plan is a record of decisions that document the 
actions necessary to compensate for the loss of wetland functions and 
values that result from converting a wetland. The mitigation plan may be 
a component of a larger natural resources conservation plan.
    (iii) The State Conservationist, in consultation with the State 
Technical Committee, may name certain types or classes of wetland not 
eligible for exemption under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section where 
the State Conservationist determines that mitigation will not achieve 
equivalent replacement of wetland functions and values within a 
reasonable time frame or for other reasons identified by the State 
Conservationist. Any type or class of wetland that a State 
Conservationist identifies as not eligible for exemption under paragraph 
(b)(4)(i) of this section will be published in the Federal Register for 
inclusion in this part.
    (5) Good faith violations. (i) A person who is determined under 
Sec. 12.4 to be ineligible for benefits as the result of the production 
of an agricultural commodity on a wetland converted after December 23, 
1985, or as the result of the conversion of a wetland after November 28, 
1990, may regain eligibility for benefits if--

[[Page 333]]

    (A) FSA determines that such person acted in good faith and without 
the intent to violate the wetland provisions of this part, and
    (B) NRCS determines that the person within an agreed to period, not 
to exceed 1 year, is implementing all practices in a mitigation plan.
    (ii) In determining whether a person acted in good faith under 
paragraph (b)(5)(i)(A) of this section, the FSA shall consider such 
factors as whether--
    (A) The characteristics of the site were such that the person should 
have been aware that a wetland existed on the subject land,
    (B) NRCS had informed the person about the existence of a wetland on 
the subject land,
    (C) The person did not convert the wetland, but planted an 
agricultural commodity on converted wetland when the person should have 
known that a wetland previously existed on the subject land,
    (D) The person has a record of violating the wetland provisions of 
this part or other Federal, State, or local wetland provisions, or
    (E) There exists other information that demonstrates that the person 
acted with the intent to violate the wetland provisions of this part.
    (iii) After the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section 
are met, USDA may waive applying the ineligibility provisions of 
Sec. 12.4.
    (6) Reliance upon NRCS wetland determination. (i) A person shall not 
be ineligible for program benefits as a result of taking an action in 
reliance on a previous certified wetland determination by NRCS.
    (ii) A person who may be ineligible for program benefits as the 
result of the production of an agricultural commodity on converted 
wetland or for the conversion of a wetland may seek relief under 
Sec. 12.11 of this part if such action was taken in reliance on an 
incorrect technical determination by NRCS as to the status of such land. 
If the error caused the person to make a substantial financial 
investment, as determined by the NRCS, for the conversion of a wetland, 
the person may be relieved of ineligibility for actions related to that 
portion of the converted wetland for which the substantial financial 
investment was expended in conversion activities. The relief available 
under this paragraph shall not apply to situations in which the person 
knew or reasonably should have known that the determination was in error 
because the characteristics of the site were such that the person should 
have been aware that a wetland existed on the subject land, or for other 
reasons.
    (7) Responsibility to provide evidence. It is the responsibility of 
the person seeking an exemption related to converted wetlands under this 
section to provide evidence, such as receipts, crop-history data, 
drawings, plans or similar information, for purposes of determining 
whether the conversion or other action is exempt in accordance with this 
section.

Sec. 12.6  Administration.

    (a) General. A determination of ineligibility for benefits in 
accordance with the provisions of this part shall be made by the agency 
of USDA to which the person has applied for benefits. All determinations 
required to be made under the provisions of this part shall be made by 
the agency responsible for making such determinations, as provided in 
this section.
    (b) Administration by FSA. (1) The provisions of this part which are 
applicable to FSA will be administered under the general supervision of 
the Administrator, FSA, and shall be carried out in the field in part by 
State FSA committees and county FSA committees (COC).
    (2) The FSA Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs may determine any 
question arising under the provisions of this part which are applicable 
to FSA and may reverse or modify any determination of eligibility with 
respect to programs administered by FSA made by a State FSA committee or 
COC or any other FSA office or FSA official (except the Administrator) 
in connection with the provisions of this part.
    (3) FSA shall make the following determinations which are required 
to be made in accordance with this part:

[[Page 334]]

    (i) Whether a person produced an agricultural commodity on a 
particular field as determined under Sec. 12.5(a)(1);
    (ii) The establishment of field boundaries;
    (iii) Whether land was planted to an agricultural commodity in any 
of the years, 1981 through 1985, for the purposes of Sec. 12.5(a)(1);
    (iv) Whether land was set aside, diverted, or otherwise not 
cultivated under a program administered by the Secretary for any crop to 
reduce production of an agricultural commodity under Sec. 12.4(g) and 
Sec. 12.5(a)(1);
    (v) Whether for the purposes of Sec. 12.9, the production of an 
agricultural commodity on highly erodible land or converted wetland by a 
landlord's tenant or sharecropper is required under the terms and 
conditions of the agreement between the landlord and such tenant or 
sharecropper;
    (vi) Whether the conversion of a particular wetland was commenced 
before December 23, 1985, for the purposes of Sec. 12.5(b)(3);
    (vii) Whether the conversion of a wetland was caused by a third 
party under Sec. 12.5(b)(1)(vii)(D);
    (viii) Whether certain violations were made in good faith under 
Secs. 12.5(a)(5) or 12.5(b)(5);
    (ix) The determination of the amount of reduction in benefits based 
on the seriousness of the violation, based on technical information 
provided by NRCS;
    (x) The determination of whether the application of the producer's 
conservation system would impose an undue economic hardship on the 
producer; and
    (xi) Whether the proceeds of a farm loan made, insured, or 
guaranteed by FSA will be used for a purpose that will contribute to 
excessive erosion of highly erodible land or to the conversion of 
wetland.
    (4) A representative number of farms selected in accordance with 
instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator shall be inspected by an 
authorized representative of FSA to determine compliance with any 
requirement specified in this part as a prerequisite for obtaining 
program benefits.
    (5) FSA may consult with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on third-
party determinations.
    (c) Administration by NRCS. (1) The provisions of this part that are 
applicable to NRCS shall be administered under the general supervision 
of the Deputy Chief for Natural Resources Conservation Programs, and 
shall be carried out in the field by the regional conservationist, state 
conservationist, area conservationist, and district conservationist or 
other NRCS representative.
    (2) An NRCS representative shall make the following determinations 
which are required to be made in accordance with this part:
    (i) Whether land is highly erodible or has a wetland type or a 
converted wetland identified in accordance with the provisions of this 
part;
    (ii) Whether highly erodible land is predominant on a particular 
field under Sec. 12.22;
    (iii) Whether the conservation plan that a person is applying is 
based on the local NRCS field office technical guide and is approved 
by--
    (A) The CD and NRCS, or
    (B) By NRCS;
    (iv) Whether the conservation system that a person is using has been 
approved by the CD under Sec. 12.5(a)(2) or, in an area not within a CD, 
a conservation system approved by NRCS to be adequate for the production 
of an agricultural commodity on highly erodible land;
    (v) Whether the actions of a person(s) with respect to the 
conversion of a wetland or production of an agricultural commodity on 
converted wetland would have only a minimal effect on the functions and 
values of wetlands in the area;
    (vi) Whether an approved conservation plan is being applied on 
highly erodible fields in accordance with the schedule specified therein 
or whether a failure to apply the plan is technical and minor in nature, 
due to circumstances beyond the control of the person, or whether a 
temporary variance form the requirements of the plan should be granted;
    (vii) Whether an approved conservation system is being used on a 
highly erodible field;

[[Page 335]]

    (viii) Whether the conversion of a wetland is for the purpose or has 
the effect of making the production of an agricultural commodity 
possible;
    (ix) Whether a farmed wetland or farmed-wetland pasture is 
abandoned;
    (x) Whether the planting of an agricultural commodity on a wetland 
is possible under natural conditions;
    (xi) Whether maintenance of existing drainage of a wetland described 
in Sec. 12.33 exceeds the scope and effect of the original drainage;
    (xii) Whether a plan for the mitigation of a converted wetland will 
be approved and whether the mitigation of a converted wetland is 
accomplished according to the approved mitigation plan;
    (xiii) Whether all technical information relating to the 
determination of a violation and severity of a violation has been 
provided to FSA for making payment-reduction determinations; and
    (xiv) Whether or not a commenced-conversion activity was completed 
by January 1, 1995.
    (3) NRCS may provide such other technical assistance for 
implementation of the provisions of this part as is determined to be 
necessary.
    (4) A person may obtain a highly erodible land or a wetland scope-
and-effect determination by making a written request on Form AD-1026. 
The determination will be made in writing, and a copy will be provided 
to the person.
    (5) A determination of whether or not an area meets the highly 
erodible land criteria or whether wetland criteria, identified in 
accordance with the current Federal wetland delineation methodology in 
use at the time of the determination and that are consistent with 
current mapping conventions, may be made by the NRCS representative 
based upon existing records or other information and without the need 
for an on-site determination. This determination will be made by the 
NRCS representative as soon as possible following a request for such a 
determination.
    (6) An on-site determination as to whether an area meets the 
applicable criteria shall be made by an NRCS representative if the 
person has disagreed with the determination made under paragraph (c)(5) 
of this section, or if adequate information is not otherwise available 
to an NRCS representative on which to make an off-site determination.
    (7) An on-site determination, where applicable, will be made by the 
NRCS representative as soon as possible following a request for such a 
determination, but only when site conditions are favorable for the 
evaluation of soils, hydrology, or vegetation.
    (8) With regard to wetland determinations, if an area is 
continuously inundated or saturated for long periods of time during the 
growing season to such an extent that access by foot to make a 
determination of predominance of hydric soils or prevalence of 
hydrophytic vegetation is not feasible, the area will be determined to 
be a wetland.
    (9) Persons who are adversely affected by a determination made under 
this section and believe that the requirements of this part were 
improperly applied may appeal, under Sec. 12.12 of this part, any 
determination by NRCS.
    (d) Administration by CSREES. The CSREES shall coordinate the 
related information and education program for USDA concerning 
implementation of this rule.
    (e) Assistance of other Federal agencies. If NRCS determines, 
through agreement or otherwise, that the purposes of this part would be 
furthered by the assistance of other Federal agencies with wetland 
responsibilities, NRCS may accept such assistance and adopt any or all 
such actions by these agencies as an action by an NRCS representative 
under this part.

Sec. 12.7  Certification of compliance.

    (a) Self-certification. In order for a person to be determined to be 
eligible for any of the benefits specified in Sec. 12.4:
    (1) It must be determined by USDA whether any field in which the 
person applying for the benefits has an interest and intends to produce 
an agricultural commodity contains highly erodible land;

[[Page 336]]

    (2) The person applying for or receiving the benefits must certify 
in writing on Form AD-1026 that such person will not produce an 
agricultural commodity on highly erodible land, or designate such land 
for conservation use; or plant an agricultural commodity on a converted 
wetland; or convert a wetland to make possible the production of an 
agricultural commodity during the crop year in which the person is 
seeking such benefits, unless such actions are exempt, under Sec. 12.5, 
from the provisions of Sec. 12.4 of this part;
    (3) A person may certify application of practices required by the 
person's conservation plan. NRCS shall permit a person who makes such a 
certification with respect to a conservation plan to revise the 
conservation plan in any manner, if the same level of conservation 
treatment provided for by the conservation system under the person's 
conservation plan is maintained. NRCS may not revise the person's 
conservation plan without the concurrence of the person;
    (4) The person applying for a FSA direct or guaranteed farm credit 
program loan must certify that such person shall not use the proceeds of 
the loan for a purpose that will contribute to excessive erosion on 
highly erodible land or to conversion of wetlands for the purpose, or to 
have the effect, of making the production of an agricultural commodity 
possible; and
    (5) The person applying for the benefits must authorize and provide 
representatives of USDA access to all land in which such person has an 
interest for the purpose of verifying any such certification.
    (b) Availability to other agencies. Each agency of USDA shall make 
all certifications of compliance received by such agency and the results 
of investigations concerning such certifications of compliance available 
to other agencies.
    (c) Compliance. A certification made in accordance with this section 
does not relieve any person from compliance with provisions of this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 12.8  Affiliated persons.

    (a) Ineligibility of affiliated persons. Ineligibility of an 
individual or entity under this part for benefits shall also be an 
ineligibility for benefits for ``affiliated persons'' as defined in this 
section.
    (b) Affiliated persons of an individual. If the person requesting 
benefits is an individual, the affiliated persons are:
    (1) The spouse and minor child of such person or guardian of such 
child; except that spouses who establish to the satisfaction of the COC 
that operations of the husband and wife are maintained separately and 
independently shall not be considered affiliates;
    (2) Any partnership, joint venture, or other enterprise in which the 
person or any person listed in paragraphs (b)(1) has an ownership 
interest or financial interest; unless such interest is held indirectly 
through another business enterprise; or
    (3) Any trust in which the individual, business enterprise, or any 
person listed in paragraph (b)(1) is a beneficiary or has a financial 
interest, unless such interest is held indirectly through another 
business enterprise.
    (c) Affiliated persons of an entity. If the person who has requested 
benefits from USDA is a corporation, partnership, or other joint 
venture, the affiliated persons are any participant or stockholder 
therein of the corporation, partnership, or other joint venture, except 
for persons who have an indirect interest through another business 
enterprise in such corporation, partnership, or other joint venture or 
persons with a 20 percent or less share in a corporation.
    (d) Limitation. Any reduction in payments which results only from 
the application of the affiliation provisions of this section to a 
partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise shall be limited 
to the extent of interest held in such partnership, joint venture, 
trust, or other enterprise by the person or business enterprise that 
committed the violation. However, for violations for which the business 
enterprise is considered directly responsible under the provisions of 
this part, the business enterprise shall be subject to a full loss of 
benefits, including those instances in which the business enterprise has 
an interest in the land where the violation occurred or where the 
business enterprise had an interest in the crops produced on the land.

[[Page 337]]

    (e) Avoidance of this part. Limitations on affiliation shall not 
apply as needed to correct for any action that would otherwise tend to 
defeat the purposes of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 12.9  Landlords and tenants.

    (a) Landlord eligibility. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section, the ineligibility of a tenant or sharecropper for 
benefits (as determined under Sec. 12.4) shall not cause a landlord to 
be ineligible for USDA program benefits accruing with respect to land 
other than those in which the tenant or sharecropper has an interest.
    (2) The provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not be 
applicable to a landlord if the production of an agricultural commodity 
on highly erodible land or converted wetland by the landlord's tenant or 
sharecropper is required under the terms and conditions of the agreement 
between the landlord and such tenant or sharecropper and such agreement 
was entered into after December 23, 1985, or if the landlord has 
acquiesced in such activities by the tenant or sharecropper.
    (b) Tenant or renter eligibility. (1) The ineligibility of a tenant 
or renter may be limited to the program benefits listed in Sec. 12.4(c) 
accruing with respect to only the farm on which the violation occurred 
if:
    (i) The tenant or renter shows that a good-faith effort was made to 
comply by developing an approved conservation plan for the highly 
erodible land in a timely manner and prior to any violation of the 
provisions of this part; and
    (ii) The owner of such farm refuses to apply such a plan and 
prevents the tenant or renter from implementing certain practices that 
are a part of the approved conservation plan; and
    (iii) FSA determines that the lack of compliance is not a part of a 
scheme or device as described in Sec. 12.10.
    (2) If relief is granted under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the 
tenant or renter must actively apply those conservation treatment 
measures that are determined to be within the control of the tenant or 
renter.


<R05>
Sec. 12.10  Scheme or device.

    All or any part of the benefits listed in Sec. 12.4 otherwise due a 
person from USDA may be withheld or required to be refunded if the 
person adopts or participates in adopting any scheme or device designed 
to evade, or which has the effect of evading, the provisions of this 
part. Such acts shall include, but are not limited to, concealing from 
USDA any information having a bearing on the application of the 
provisions of this part or submitting false information to USDA or 
creating entities for the purpose of concealing the interest of a person 
in a farming operation or to otherwise avoid compliance with the 
provisions of this part. Such acts shall also include acquiescence in, 
approval of, or assistance to acts which have the effect of, or the 
purpose of, circumventing these regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 12.11  Action based upon advice or action of USDA.

    The provisions of part 718 of this Title, as amended, relating to 
performance based upon the action or advice of a County Committee (COC) 
or State FSA Committee shall be applicable to the provisions of this 
part. In addition, if it is determined by the appropriate USDA agency 
that the action of a person which would form the basis of any 
ineligibility under this part was taken by such person in good-faith 
reliance on erroneous advice, information, or action of any other 
authorized representative of USDA, the appropriate agency may make such 
benefits available to the extent that similar relief would be allowed 
under 7 CFR part 718.


<R05>
Sec. 12.12  Appeals.

    Any person who has been or who would be denied program benefits in 
accordance with Sec. 12.4 as the result of any determination made in 
accordance with the provisions of this part may obtain a review of such 
determination in accordance with the administrative appeals procedures 
of the agency which rendered such determination. Agency appeal 
procedures are contained in the Code of Federal Regulations as follows: 
FSA, part 780 of this title; NRCS, part 614 of this title; Rural 
Utilities Service, part 1900, subpart B of this title.

              Subpart B--Highly Erodible Land Conservation


<R05>
Sec. 12.20  NRCS responsibilities regarding highly erodible land.

    In implementing the provisions of this part, NRCS shall, to the 
extent practicable:
    (a) Develop and maintain criteria for identifying highly erodible 
lands;
    (b) Prepare and make available to the public lists of highly 
erodible soil map units;
    (c) Make soil surveys for purposes of identifying highly erodible 
land; and
    (d) Provide technical guidance to conservation districts which 
approve conservation plans and systems, in consultation with local 
county FSA committees, for the purposes of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 12.21  Identification of highly erodible lands criteria.

    (a) Basis for identification as highly erodible. Soil map units and 
an erodibility index will be used as the basis for identifying highly 
erodible land. The erodibility index for a soil is determined by 
dividing the potential average annual rate of erosion for each soil by 
its predetermined soil loss tolerance (T) value. The T value represents 
the maximum annual rate of soil erosion that could occur without causing 
a decline in long-term productivity. The equation for measuring erosion 
is described below.
    (1) The potential average annual rate of sheet and rill erosion is 
estimated by multiplying the following factors of the Universal Soil 
Loss Equation (USLE):
    (i) Rainfall and runoff (R);
    (ii) The degree to which the soil resists water erosion (K); and
    (iii) The function (LS), which includes the effects of slope length 
(L) and steepness (S).
    (2) The potential average annual rate of wind erosion is estimated 
by multiplying the following factors of the Wind Erosion Equation (WEQ): 
Climatic characterization of windspeed and surface soil moisture (C) and 
the degree to which soil resists wind erosion (I).
    (3) The USLE is explained in the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
Handbook 537, ``Predicting Rainfall Erosion Losses.'' The WEQ is 
explained in the paper by Woodruff, N.P., and F. H. Siddaway, 1965, ``A 
Wind Erosion Equation,'' Soil Science Society of America Proceedings, 
Vol. 29. No. 5, pages 602-608. Values for all the factors used in these 
equations are contained in the NRCS field office technical guide and the 
references which are a part of the guide. The Universal Soil Loss 
Equation, the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation, and the Wind Erosion 
Equation and the rules under which NRCS uses the equations are published 
at Secs. 610.11 through 610.15 of this title.
    (b) Highly erodible. A soil map unit shall be determined to be 
highly erodible if either the RKLS/T or the CI/T value for the map unit 
equals or exceeds 8.
    (c) Potentially highly erodible. Whenever a soil map unit 
description contains a range of a slope length and steepness 
characteristics that produce a range of LS values which result in RKLS/T 
quotients both above and below 8, the soil map unit will be entered on 
the list of highly erodible soil map units as ``potentially highly 
erodible.'' The final determination of erodibility for an individual 
field containing these soil map unit delineations will be made by an on-
site investigation.

[61 FR 47025, Sept. 6, 1996; 61 FR 53491, Oct. 11, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 12.22  Highly erodible field determination criteria.

    (a) Predominance. Highly erodible land shall be considered to be 
predominant on a field if either:
    (1) 33.33 percent or more of the total field acreage is identified 
as soil map units which are highly erodible; or
    (2) 50 or more acres in such field are identified as soil map units 
which are highly erodible.
    (b) Modification of field boundaries. A person may request the 
modification of field boundaries for the purpose of excluding highly 
erodible land from a field. Such a request must be submitted to, and is 
subject to the approval of, FSA. FSA shall use the technical 
determination of NRCS in approving this request.

[[Page 339]]

    (c) Impact of changing field boundaries. When field boundaries are 
changed to include areas of land that were included in a field that was 
previously determined to be predominately highly erodible according to 
paragraph (a) of this section, such areas shall continue to be subject 
to the requirements for predominately highly erodible fields, except as 
provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) Small area of noncropland. Small areas of noncropland within or 
adjacent to the boundaries of existing highly erodible crop fields such 
as abandoned farmsteads, areas around filled or capped wells, rock 
piles, trees, or brush which are converted to cropland are considered to 
meet the requirement of Sec. 12.5(a)(2) if they are included in an 
approved conservation plan for the entire highly erodible field.

[61 FR 47025, Sept. 6, 1996; 61 FR 53491, Oct. 11, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 12.23  Conservation plans and conservation systems.

    (a) Use of field office technical guide. A conservation plan or 
conservation system developed for the purposes of Sec. 12.5(a) must be 
based on, and to the extent practicable conform with, the NRCS field 
office technical guide in use at the time the plan is developed or 
revised. For highly erodible croplands which were used to produce 
agricultural commodities prior to December 23, 1985, the applicable 
conservation systems in the field office technical guide are designed to 
achieve substantial reductions in soil erosion. Conservation systems 
shall be technically and economically feasible; based on local resource 
conditions and available conservation technology; cost-effective; and 
shall not cause undue economic hardship on the person applying the 
conservation system. Any conservation plans or systems that were 
approved prior to July 3, 1996, are deemed to be in compliance with this 
paragraph.
    (b) Substantial reduction in soil erosion. For the purpose of 
determining whether there is a substantial reduction in soil erosion on 
a field containing highly erodible cropland which was used to produce an 
agricultural commodity prior to December 23, 1985, the measurement of 
erosion reduction achieved by applying a conservation plan or system 
shall be based on a comparison of the estimated annual level of erosion 
that is expected to occur on that portion of the field for which a 
conservation plan or system was developed and is being applied, to the 
estimated annual level of erosion that existed on that same portion of 
the field before the application of a conservation plan or system. On a 
field that is converted from native vegetation after July 3, 1996, and 
where any crop production will result in increased erosion, in no case 
will the required conservation plan or system permit a substantial 
increase in erosion.
    (c) Field trials. NRCS may allow a person to include in the person's 
conservation plan or a conservation system under the plan, on a field-
trial basis, practices that are not currently approved but that NRCS 
considers have a reasonable likelihood of success. These trials must 
have prior approval by NRCS, and must be documented in the person's 
conservation plan specifying the limited time period during which the 
field trial is in effect. If, at the end of the conservation field trial 
period, NRCS finds that the practice does not meet conservation 
compliance requirements, the person will not be ineligible for USDA 
program benefits during the period of the field trial.
    (d) Highly erodible land previously under a Conservation Reserve 
Program contract. Any person who owns or operates highly erodible land 
that was under a Conservation Reserve Program contract as authorized by 
section 1231 of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, shall have 2 
years after the expiration of termination of the contract to fully apply 
a conservation system if the conservation plan for such land requires 
the installation of structural measures for the production of an 
agricultural commodity. NRCS officials may extend this period one 
additional year for circumstances beyond the control of the person. The 
person shall not be required to meet a higher conservation standard than 
the standard applied to other highly erodible cropland located within 
the area served by the field office technical guide for the area in 
which the field is located.

[[Page 340]]

    (e) Information regarding conservation options. NRCS, in providing 
assistance to a person for the preparation or revision of a conservation 
plan under this part, will provide such person with information 
concerning cost-effective and applicable erosion control alternatives, 
crop flexibility, or other conservation assistance options that may be 
available.
    (f) Timely request for assistance. Persons who require NRCS 
assistance for the development of a conservation plan or the 
installation of a conservation system are encouraged to request this 
assistance well in advance of deadline dates for compliance; otherwise 
the person may not be able to comply with these provisions and maintain 
eligibility for USDA program benefits.
    (g) Action by conservation districts. Conservation districts approve 
or disapprove conservation plans or conservation systems after NRCS 
determines that the plans or systems conform to the NRCS field office 
technical guide. If a conservation district fails, without due cause, to 
act on a request for conservation plan or conservation system approval 
within 45 days, or if no conservation district exists, NRCS will approve 
or disapprove, as appropriate, the conservation plan or system in 
question.
    (h) Application of a conservation plan or system. A person is 
considered to be applying a conservation plan for purposes of 
Sec. 12.5(a) if the conservation system or plan being applied achieves 
or exceeds the substantial reduction in soil erosion as described in 
paragraph (b) which the conservation system or plan was designed to 
achieve. It is the responsibility of the person to:
    (1) Certify that the conservation plan or system is being applied; 
and
    (2) Arrange for a revision of the conservation plan with NRCS, if 
changes are made in land use, crop rotation or management, conservation 
practices, or in the original schedule of practice installation that 
would affect the achievement of substantial reduction in soil erosion in 
a given crop year.
    (i) Appeal to FSA. Persons who are adversely affected by the 
determinations made under this subpart and believe that the requirements 
of this subpart were improperly applied may appeal the decision to FSA 
under Sec. 12.12.
    (j) Undue economic hardship. After a technical determination has 
been made, the FSA county committee shall, if a person asserts that the 
application of the person's conservation system would impose an undue 
economic hardship on the person, make a recommendation to the State FSA 
Committee as to whether or not the application of the conservation 
system would impose an undue economic hardship. The State FSA Committee 
may provide the person with a variance on the basis of the hardship. 
Under this variance, and any conditions that may be required in the 
variance, the person will be considered to be in compliance with the 
applicable provisions of this part. The State FSA Committee will 
consider relevant factors, such as the cost of installation of required 
conservation practices and benefits earned through programs subject to 
compliance with this part, and the person's general economic situation.

<R05>
Sec. 12.30  NRCS responsibilities regarding wetlands.

    (a) Technical and coordination responsibilities. In carrying out the 
provisions of this part, NRCS shall:
    (1) Oversee the development and application of criteria to identify 
hydric soils in consultation with the National Technical Committee for 
Hydric Soils and make available to the public an approved county list of 
hydric soil map units, which is based upon the National List of Hydric 
Soils;
    (2) Coordinate with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and others in 
updating the National List of Plant Species that Occur in Wetlands;
    (3) Make or approve wetland determinations, delineations and 
certifications, functional assessments, mitigation plans, categorical 
minimal effects, and other technical determinations relative to the 
implementation of the wetland conservation provisions of this part;
    (4) Develop and utilize off-site and on-site wetland identification 
procedures;

[[Page 341]]

    (5) Assure quality of service and determinations through procedures 
developed by NRCS in consultation with other Federal agencies that have 
wetland responsibilities;
    (6) Investigate complaints and make technical determinations 
regarding potential violations;
    (7) Develop a process at the state level, in coordination with the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to ensure that these provisions are 
carried out in a technically defensible and timely manner, seek 
assistance as appropriate, and annually review the progress being made 
on implementation; and
    (8) Conduct reviews of implementation and provide the Army Corps of 
Engineers, Environmental Protection Agency, and the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service an opportunity to participate in this review.
    (b) Technical assistance from others In carrying out the provisions 
of this part, NRCS may request technical assistance from the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service, State or local agencies, conservation districts, 
or qualified private entities when NRCS determines that additional staff 
resources or technical expertise are needed to address adequately the 
requirements of this part or to enhance the quality of implementation of 
this part.
    (c) Certification of wetland determinations and wetland 
delineations. (1) Certification of a wetland determination means that 
the wetland determination is of sufficient quality to make a 
determination of ineligibility for program benefits under Sec. 12.4 of 
this part. Certification of a wetland determination shall be completed 
according to delineation procedures agreed to by the Army Corps of 
Engineers, the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service and NRCS. NRCS may certify a wetland determination 
without making a field investigation. NRCS will notify the person 
affected by the certification and provide an opportunity to appeal the 
certification prior to the certification becoming final. All wetland 
determinations made after July 3, 1996, will be done on a tract basis 
and will be considered certified wetland determinations. A not-
inventoried designation within a certified wetland is subject to change 
when the soil, hydrology, and vegetation evaluation is completed and 
identified as to type of wetland or as a non-wetland. This change from a 
not-inventoried designation to an approved wetland designation will be 
done at the request of the landowner or during a formal investigation of 
a potential violation.
    (2) The wetland determination and wetland delineation shall be 
certified as final by the NRCS official 30 days after providing the 
person notice of certification or, if an appeal is filed with USDA, 
after the administrative appeal procedures are exhausted.
    (3) In the case of an appeal, NRCS will review and certify the 
accuracy of the determination of all lands subject to the appeal to 
ensure that the subject lands have been accurately delineated. Prior to 
a decision being rendered on the appeal, NRCS will conduct an on-site 
investigation of the subject land.
    (4) Before any benefits are withheld, an on-site investigation of a 
potential wetland violation will be made by NRCS. The affected person 
will be provided an opportunity to appeal the on-site determination to 
USDA if the on-site determination differs from the original 
determination. Such action by NRCS shall be considered a review of the 
prior determination and certification of the delineation. If the prior 
determination was a certified wetland determination, an appeal of the 
NRCS on-site determination shall be limited to the determination that 
the wetland was converted in violation of this part.
    (5) A copy of the information from the final certified wetland 
determination and the wetland delineation shall be recorded on official 
USDA aerial photography, digital imagery, or other graphic 
representation of the area.
    (6) As long as the affected person is in compliance with the wetland 
conservation provision of this part, and as long as the area is devoted 
to the use and management of the land for production of food, fiber, or 
horticultural crops, a certification made under this section will remain 
valid and in effect until such time as the person affected by the 
certification requests review of the certification by NRCS. A person may 
request review of a certification

[[Page 342]]

only if a natural event alters the topography or hydrology of the 
subject land to the extent that the final certification is no longer a 
reliable indication of site conditions, or if NRCS concurs with an 
affected person that an error exists in the current wetland 
determination

<R05>
Sec. 12.31  On-site wetland identification criteria.

    (a) Hydric soils. (1) NRCS shall identify hydric soils through the 
use of published soil maps which reflect soil surveys completed by NRCS 
or through the use of on-site reviews. If a published soil map is 
unavailable for a given area, NRCS may use unpublished soil maps which 
were made according to the specifications of the National Cooperative 
Soil Survey or may conduct an on-site evaluation of the land.
    (2) NRCS shall determine whether an area of a field or other parcel 
of land has a predominance of hydric soils that are inundated or 
saturated as follows:
    (i) If a soil map unit has hydric soil as all or part of its name, 
that soil map unit or portion of the map unit related to the hydric soil 
shall be determined to have a predominance of hydric soils;
    (ii) If a soil map unit is named for a miscellaneous area that meets 
the criteria for hydric soils (i.e., riverwash, playas, beaches, or 
water) the soil map unit shall be determined to have a predominance of 
hydric soils; or
    (iii) If a soil map unit contains inclusions of hydric soils, that 
portion of the soil map unit identified as hydric soil shall be 
determined to have a predominance of hydric soils.
    (3) List of hydric soils. (i) Hydric soils are those soils which 
meet criteria set forth in the publication ``Hydric Soils of the United 
States 1985'' which was developed by the National Technical Committee 
for Hydric Soils and which is incorporated by reference. This 
publication may be obtained upon request by writing NRCS at U.S. 
Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 2890, Washington, DC 20013, and is 
available for inspection at the Office of the Federal Register 
Information Center, 800 North Capitol Street NW., Suite 700, Washington, 
DC 20408. Incorporation of this publication by reference was approved by 
the Director of the Federal Register on June 24, 1986. The materials are 
incorporated as they exist on the date of the approval and a notice of 
any change in these materials will be published in the Federal Register.
    (ii) An official list of hydric soil map units shall be maintained 
at the local NRCS office and shall include--
    (A) All soils from the National List of Hydric Soils that can be 
found in that field office area, and
    (B) Any soil map units or areas which the state conservationist 
determines to meet such hydric soil criteria.
    (iii) Any deletions of a hydric soil unit from the hydric soil map 
unit list must be made according to the established procedure contained 
in the publication ``Hydric Soils of the United States 1985'' for adding 
or deleting soils from the National List of Hydric Soils.
    (b) Hydrophytic vegetation. Hydrophytic vegetation consists of 
plants growing in water or in a substrate that is at least periodically 
deficient in oxygen during a growing season as a result of excessive 
water content.
    (1) A plant shall be considered to be a plant species that occurs in 
wetland if such plant is listed in the National List of Plant Species 
that Occur in Wetlands. The publication may be obtained upon request 
from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at National Wetland Inventory, 
Monroe Bldg. Suite 101, 9720 Executive Center Drive, St. Petersburg, 
Florida 33702.
    (2) For the purposes of the definition of ``wetland'' in Sec. 12.2 
of this part, land shall be determined to have a prevalence of 
hydrophytic vegetation if:
    (i) NRCS determines through the criteria specified in paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section that under normal circumstances such land 
supports a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation. The term ``normal 
circumstances'' refers to the soil and hydrologic conditions that are 
normally present, without regard to whether the vegetation has been 
removed; or
    (ii) In the event the vegetation on such land has been altered or 
removed, NRCS will determine if a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation 
typically exists in the local area on the same hydric

[[Page 343]]

soil map unit under non-altered hydrologic conditions.
    (3) The determination of prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation will 
be made in accordance with the current Federal wetland delineation 
methodology in use by NRCS at the time of the determination.
    (c) Mitigation wetlands. Notwithstanding the provisions of this 
section, wetlands which are created in order to mitigate the loss of 
other wetlands as a result of irrigation, recreation, municipal water, 
flood control, or other similar projects shall not be considered to be 
artificial wetland for the purposes of Sec. 12.5(b)(1)(vii)(A) of this 
part.
    (d) Minimal effect determination. For the purposes of 
Sec. 12.5(b)(1)(v) of this part, NRCS shall determine whether the effect 
of any action of a person associated with the conversion of a wetland, 
the conversion of wetland and the production of an agricultural 
commodity on converted wetland, or the combined effect of the production 
of an agricultural commodity on a wetland converted by someone else has 
a minimal effect on the functions and values of wetlands in the area. 
Such determination shall be based upon a functional assessment of 
functions and values of the wetland under consideration and other 
related wetlands in the area, and will be made through an on-site 
evaluation. A request for such determination will be made prior to the 
beginning of activities that would convert the wetland. If a person has 
converted a wetland and then seeks a determination that the effect of 
such conversion on wetland was minimal, the burden will be upon the 
person to demonstrate to the satisfaction of NRCS that the effect was 
minimal.

The production of an agricultural commodity on any portion of a 
converted wetland in conformance with a minimal-effect determination by 
NRCS is exempt under Sec. 12.5(b)(1)(v) of this part. However, any 
additional action of a person that will change the functions and values 
of a wetland for which a minimal-effect determination has been made 
shall be reported to NRCS for a determination of whether the effect 
continues to be minimal. The loss of a minimal effect determination will 
cause a person who produces an agricultural commodity on the converted 
wetland after such change in status to be ineligible, under Sec. 12.4, 
for certain program benefits. In situations where the wetland functions 
and values are replaced by the restoration, enhancement or creation of a 
wetland in accordance with a mitigation plan approved by NRCS, the 
exemption provided by the determination will be effective after NRCS 
determines that all practices in a mitigation plan are being 
implemented.
    (e) Categorical Minimal Effect Exemptions. (1) The state 
conservationist, in consultation with the state technical committee 
established under 16 U.S.C. 3861, shall identify any categories of 
conversion activities and conditions which are routinely determined by 
NRCS to have minimal effect on wetland functions and values, as 
described in paragraph (d) of this section, and recommend to the Chief, 
NRCS, or a designee, inclusion on a list of categorical minimal effect 
exemptions.
    (2) The Chief, or designee, shall evaluate the conversion practices 
recommended by the state conservationists in the region to ensure 
consistency across State and regional lines, and to determine whether 
any categories of conversion activities identified pursuant to paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section, if such activities were exempt from the 
ineligibility provisions of Sec. 12.4, would only have a minimal effect 
on wetland functions and values in a wetland system within the region.
    (3) Any categories of conversion activities which meet the criteria 
of paragraph (e)(2) of this section will be published in the Federal 
register for inclusion in this part and shall be exempt under 
Sec. 12.5(b)(1)(v) of this part.
    (4) The NRCS local field office shall maintain a list of any 
activities and conditions which are determined by the Chief, or 
designee, exempt pursuant to this section and will provide the list to a 
person upon request.


<R05>
Sec. 12.32  Converted wetland identification criteria.

    (a) Converted wetland shall be identified by determining whether the 
wetland was altered so as to meet the definition of converted wetland. 
In making

[[Page 344]]

this determination, the following factors are to be considered:
    (1) Where hydric soils have been used for production of an 
agricultural commodity and the effect of the drainage or other altering 
activity is not clearly discernible, NRCS will compare the site with 
other sites containing the same hydric soils in a natural condition to 
determine if the hydric soils can or cannot be used to produce an 
agricultural commodity under natural conditions. If the soil on the 
comparison site could not produce an agricultural commodity under 
natural conditions, the subject wetland will be considered to be 
converted wetland.
    (2) Where woody hydrophytic vegetation has been removed from hydric 
soils for the purpose of or permitting the production of an agricultural 
commodity, the area will be considered to be converted wetland.
    (b) A wetland shall not be considered to be converted if:
    (1) Production of an agricultural commodity on such land is possible 
as a result of a natural condition, such as drought, and it is 
determined that the actions of the person producing such agricultural 
commodity does not permanently alter or destroy natural wetland 
characteristics. Destruction of herbaceous hydrophytic vegetation (i.e., 
plants other than woody shrubs or trees) as a result of the production 
of an agricultural commodity shall not be considered as altering or 
destroying natural wetland characteristic if such vegetation could 
return following cessation of the natural condition which made 
production of the agricultural commodity possible; or
    (2) Such land is correctly identified as farmed wetland or farmed-
wetland pasture.


<R05>
Sec. 12.33  Use of wetland and converted wetland.

    (a) The provisions of Sec. 12.32(b)(2) are intended to protect 
remaining functions and values of the wetlands described therein. 
Persons may continue to farm such wetlands under natural conditions or 
as they did prior to December 23, 1985. However, no action can be taken 
to increase effects on the water regime beyond that which existed on 
such lands on or before December 23, 1985, unless NRCS determines the 
effect on losing remaining wetland values would be minimal under 
Sec. 12.5(b)(1)(v). If, after December 23, 1985, changes due to human 
activity occurred in the watershed and resulted in an increase in the 
water regime on a person's land, the person may be allowed to adjust the 
existing drainage system to accommodate the increased water regime on 
the condition that the person affected by this additional water provides 
NRCS with appropriate documentation of the increased water regime, the 
causes thereof, and the planned changes in the existing drainage system. 
In order to maintain program eligibility, a person must provide 
sufficient documentation and receive approval from NRCS prior to making 
any changes that will have the effect of increasing the capacity of the 
existing drainage systems.
    (b) Unless otherwise provided in this part, the production of an 
agricultural commodity on land determined by NRCS to be prior-converted 
cropland is exempted by law from these regulations for the area which 
was converted. Maintenance or improvement of drainage systems on prior-
converted croplands are not subject to this rule so long as the prior-
converted croplands are used for the production of food, forage, or 
fiber and as long as such actions do not alter the hydrology of nearby 
wetlands or do not make possible the production of an agricultural 
commodity on these other wetlands. Other wetlands under this section 
means any natural wetland, farmed wetland, farmed-wetland pasture, or 
any converted wetland that is not exempt under Sec. 12.5 of this part.
    (c) Abandonment is the cessation for five consecutive years of 
management or maintenance operations related to the use of a farmed 
wetland or a farmed-wetland pasture. Unless the criteria for receiving 
an exemption under Sec. 12.5(b)(1)(iii) are met, such land is considered 
to be abandoned when the land meets the wetland criteria of Sec. 12.31. 
In order for documentation of site conditions to be considered adequate 
under Sec. 12.5(b)(1)(iii), the affected person must provide to NRCS 
available information concerning the extent of hydrological 
manipulation, the extent

[[Page 345]]

of woody vegetation, and the history of use. In accordance with 
Sec. 12.5(b)(1)(iii), participation in a USDA approved wetland 
restoration, set-aside, diverted acres, or similar programs shall not be 
deemed to constitute abandonment.
    (d) The maintenance of the drainage capacity or any alteration or 
manipulation, including the maintenance of a natural waterway operated 
and maintained as a drainage outlet, that affects the circulation and 
flow of water made to a farmed wetland or farmed-wetland pasture would 
not cause a person to be determined to be ineligible under this part, 
provided that the maintenance does not exceed the scope and effect of 
the original alteration or manipulation, as determined by NRCS, and 
provided that the area is not abandoned. Any resultant conversion of 
wetlands is to be at the minimum extent practicable, as determined by 
NRCS.

    Source: 45 FR 58507, Sept. 4, 1980, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 14.1  Purpose.

    (a) Part 14 sets forth criteria to be used by the Secretary of 
Agriculture in determining the primary purpose of certain payments 
received by persons under applicable programs. Determining the primary 
purpose for which applicable payments are made is one step toward the 
exclusion of all or part of the payments from gross income for Federal 
income tax purposes.
    (b) The criteria set forth in part 14 apply only to the 
determinations to be made by the Secretary of Agriculture.


<R05>
Sec. 14.2  Applicability.

    (a) Part 14 applies only to payments received under the programs 
listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (10) of this section. Payments 
received under programs not listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (10) of 
this section, are not considered eligible for exclusion from gross 
income under this part.
    (1) The rural clean water program authorized by section 208(j) of 
the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1288(j)).
    (2) The rural abandoned mine program authorized by section 406 of 
the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1236).
    (3) The water bank program authorized by the Water Bank Act (16 
U.S.C. 1301 et seq.).
    (4) The emergency conservation measures program authorized by title 
IV of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2201 et seq.).
    (5) The agricultural conservation program authorized by the Soil 
Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act (16 U.S.C. 590a).
    (6) The Great Plains conservation program authorized by section 16 
of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act (16 U.S.C. 590p(b)).
    (7) The resource conservation and development program authorized by 
the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act and by the Soil Conservation and 
Domestic Allotment Act (7 U.S.C. 1010; 16 U.S.C. 590a et seq.).
    (8) The forestry incentives program authorized by section 4 of the 
Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2103).

[[Page 346]]

    (9) Any small watershed program administered by the Secretary of 
Agriculture that is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury or his 
delegate to be substantially similar to the type of programs described 
in paragraphs (a)(1) through (8) of this section.
    (10) Any program of a State, a possession of the United States, a 
political subdivision of a State or a possession of the United States, 
the District of Columbia, or a combination of any of the foregoing under 
which payments are made primarily for the purpose of conserving soil and 
water resources, protecting or restoring the environment, improving 
forests, or providing a habitat for wildlife.
    (b) The criteria set forth in Sec. 14.5 for determining the primary 
purpose of payments with respect to their eligibility for exclusion from 
gross income shall also be used to determine the applicability of this 
part to payments received under non-Federal programs as provided in 
Sec. 14.2(a)(10).


<R05>
Sec. 14.3  Objective.

    The objective of the determinations made under part 14 is to provide 
maximum conservation, environmental, forestry improvement, and wildlife 
benefits to the general public from the operation of applicable 
programs.


<R05>
Sec. 14.4  Policy.

    Federal tax, conservation, natural resource, and environmental 
policies should complement rather than conflict with one another. 
Therefore, the Federal income tax liability on applicable payments 
should be reduced or eliminated to the extent that the payments yield 
conservation, environmental, forestry improvement, or wildlife benefits 
to the general public beyond the benefits that accrue to those who 
receive the payments.


<R05>
Sec. 14.5  Procedure.

    (a) The portion of an applicable payment that may be excluded from 
gross income under part 14 shall be that portion or all, as appropriate, 
that--
    (1) Is determined to be made primarily for the purpose of conserving 
soil and water resources, protecting or restoring the environment, 
improving forests, or providing wildlife habitat; and
    (2) Is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury as not increasing 
substantially the annual income derived from the property associated 
with the payment.
    (b) Primary purpose means the principal, fundamental, predominant, 
or independent objective for which a payment is made. The following 
shall be considered in determining the primary purpose of a payment:
    (1) Single-purpose payments shall be considered as having that 
purpose as their primary purpose.
    (2) Multiple-purpose payments. If a payment is made for several 
purposes, it may be considered as having soil and water conservation, 
environmental protection or restoration, forestry improvement, or 
providing wildlife habitat as its primary purpose to the extent of the 
portion of the payment that is made for one or more of such purposes.
    (3) Where a purpose of a payment, or portion thereof, is in doubt, 
the following sources should be considered--
    (i) Authorizing legislation, legislative history, administrative 
regulation, administrative history, interpretive case law, and the 
administrative policies and procedures under which the applicable 
program operates and the payment is made; and
    (ii) Agreements or other documentation accompanying the transfer of 
the payment;
    (iii) Use made of the payment by the recipient.


<R05>
Sec. 14.6  Criteria for determining the pri- mary purpose of payments with respect to potential exclusion from gross income.

    (a) Soil conservation. (1) Payments shall be considered to be made 
primarily for the purpose of soil conservation if they are intended to 
finance activities, measures, or practices to reduce soil deterioration.
    (2) Soil deterioration refers to impairments of the physical or 
chemical properties of soil that are largely irreversible and that can 
be expected to result in a long-term or permanent reduction in the 
productive capacity of the resource regardless of the level of

[[Page 347]]

technology available or applied. Erosion by water and wind and the 
associated changes that result in permanent or long-term reductions in 
the productive capacity of the soil are forms of soil deterioration.
    (b) Water conservation. (1) Water conservation includes actions 
that, for a given level of water supply, reduce the demand for or use of 
water by--
    (i) Improving efficiency in use;
    (ii) Reducing loss and waste;
    (iii) Increasing the recycling or reuse of water, thereby making 
existing supplies available for other current or future uses; or
    (iv) Improving land management practices for the purpose of reducing 
water use, loss, waste, increasing the efficiency of water use, or 
increasing the recycling or reuse of water.
    (2) Payments shall be considered to be made primarily for the 
purpose of water conservation if they are intended to finance actions, 
measures, or practices that can be expected to result in water 
conservation as defined in paragraph b(1) of this section.
    (c) Protecting the environment. (1) Payments shall be considered to 
be made primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment if they 
are intended to finance actions, measures, or practices undertaken to 
prevent man-caused or man-induced reductions or degradations in the 
quantity or quality of the natural external or extrinsic conditions 
directly or indirectly affecting people.
    (2) External or extrinsic conditions refer to the complex of natural 
conditions or circumstances, including but not limited to those 
affecting public health and safety, in which people reside or otherwise 
carry out their lives.
    (d) Restoring the environment. (1) Payments shall be considered to 
be made primarily for the purpose of restoring the environment if they 
are intended to finance actions, measures, or practices undertaken to 
reestablish, return, or enhance the quantity or quality of the natural 
external or extrinsic conditions directly or indirectly affecting people 
that existed before the man-caused or man-induced degradation.
    (2) External or extrinsic conditions have the same meaning with 
respect to restoring the environment as they do for protecting the 
environment.
    (e) Improving forests. (1) Payments shall be considered to be made 
primarily for the purpose of improving forests if they are intended to 
finance actions, measures, or practices undertaken for the direct or 
indirect conservation or enhancement of the quantity or quality of 
timber resources.
    (2) Improving forests includes the generation and regeneration of 
timber stands as well as the silvicultural improvement of such timber 
stands but excludes harvest cuttings not undertaken primarily for 
silvicultural improvement.
    (f) Providing habitat for wildlife. (1) Payments shall be considered 
to be made primarily for the purpose of providing habitat for wildlife 
if they are intended to finance actions, measures, or practices leading 
directly to the establishment of those physical and biological 
conditions or resources that can be expected to support primarily 
noncultivated and nondomesticated animal and plant life. The animal and 
plant life must be of value to the public in their natural state apart 
from any value that may be realized from them as private economic gain.
    (2) Wildlife includes but is not limited to species of terrestrial 
or aquatic animals and plants.
    (3) Habitat includes, but is not limited to, the food supply, water 
supply, and nesting and escape cover necessary to support populations of 
wildlife species. Included in the definition of wildlife habitat are 
domestic crops raised for the primary purpose of providing food supply 
or cover for specific wildlife species.


<R05>
Sec. 14.7  Non-Federal programs and payments.

    (a) Definition of non-Federal programs. Non-Federal program means 
any program of a State, a possession of the United States, a political 
subdivision of any State or possession of the United States, the 
District of Columbia, or a combination of any of the foregoing.
    (b) Applicability. Payments received through non-Federal programs 
under which payments are made primarily for the purpose of conserving 
soil and

[[Page 348]]

water resources, protecting or restoring the environment, improving 
forests, or providing a habitat for wildlife may be considered for 
exclusion from gross income under part 14.
    (c) Determining the primary purpose of non-Federal payments. The 
determination of the primary purpose for which non-Federal payments are 
made with respect to their potential for exclusion from gross income 
shall be made by using the criteria set forth in part 14 for determining 
the primary purpose of Federal payments.
    (d) Procedure for determining the primary purpose of payments made 
under non-Federal programs. (1) To initiate the process of determining 
the applicability of this part to payments received through non-Federal 
programs and the primary purpose of the payments for potential exclusion 
from gross income, the non-Federal official responsible for the program 
through which the payments are made should provide six copies of the 
following materials relating to the program to the Secretary of 
Agriculture--
    (i) Authorizing legislation;
    (ii) Rules or regulations;
    (iii) Current policies and procedures under which payments are made 
and used;
    (iv) A description of all practices or measures for which payments 
are made and used; and
    (v) Any other information that may be helpful in determining the 
purpose for which payments, or portions thereof, are made and used.
    (2) Any changes in the supporting documentation listed in paragraphs 
(d)(1)(i) through (d)(1)(iv) of this section, should be reported to the 
Secretary within 30 days of the date they become final.

Sec. 15.1  Purpose and application of part.

    (a) The purpose of the regulations in this part is to effectuate the 
provisions of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (hereinafter 
referred to as the ``Act'') to the end that no person in the United 
States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be 
excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be 
otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity of 
an applicant or recipient receiving Federal financial assistance from 
the Department of Agriculture or any Agency thereof.
    (b) The regulations in this part apply to any program or activity of 
an applicant or recipient for which Federal financial assistance is 
authorized under a law administered by the Department including, but not 
limited to, the Federal financial assistance listed in the appendix to 
this part. They apply to money paid, property transferred, or other 
Federal financial assistance extended to an applicant or recipient for 
its program or activity after the effective date of these regulations 
pursuant to an application approved or statutory or other provision made 
therefor prior to such effective date. The regulations in this part do 
not apply to (1) any Federal financial assistance by way of insurance or 
guaranty contract, (2) money paid, property transferred, or other 
assistance extended prior to the effective date of the regulations in 
this part, (3) any assistance to an applicant or recipient who is an 
ultimate beneficiary under any such program, or (4) except as provided 
in Sec. 15.3(c), any employment practice of any employer, employment 
agency or labor organization. The fact that a specific kind of Federal 
financial assistance is not listed in the appendix, shall not mean, if 
title VI of the Act is otherwise applicable, that such Federal financial 
assistance is not covered. Other Federal financial assistance under 
statutes now in force or hereinafter enacted may be added to this list 
by notice approved and issued by the Secretary and published in the 
Federal Register.

Sec. 15.3  Discrimination prohibited.

    (a) General. No person in the United States shall, on the ground of 
race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be 
denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination 
under any program or activity of the applicant or recipient

[[Page 351]]

to which these regulations apply. These regulations apply, but are not 
restricted, to unequal treatment in priority, quality, quantity, methods 
or charges for service, use, occupancy or benefit, participation in the 
service or benefit available, or in the use, occupancy or benefit of any 
structure, facility, or improvement.
    (b) Specific discriminatory actions prohibited. (1) A recipient 
under any program to which the regulations in this part apply may not, 
directly or through contractual or other arrangements on the ground of 
race, color, or national origin:
    (i) Deny an individual any service, financial aid, or other benefit 
provided under the program;
    (ii) Provide any service, financial aid, or other benefit, to an 
individual which is different, or is provided in a different manner, 
from that provided to others under the program;
    (iii) Subject an individual to segregation or separate treatment in 
any matter related to his receipt of any service, financial aid, or 
other benefit under the program;
    (iv) Restrict an individual in any way in the enjoyment of any 
advantage or privilege, enjoyed by others receiving any service, 
financial aid, or other benefit under the program;
    (v) Treat an individual differently from others in determining 
whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota, eligibility, 
membership or other requirement or condition which individuals must meet 
in order to be provided any service, financial aid, or other benefit 
provided under the program;
    (vi) Deny an individual an opportunity to participate in the program 
through the provisions of services or otherwise or afford him an 
opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under 
the program (including the opportunity to participate in the program as 
an employee but only to the extent set forth in paragraph (c) of this 
section).
    (vii) Deny a person the opportunity to participate as a member of a 
planning or advisory body which is an integral part of the program.
    (2) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial 
aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any 
such program, or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in 
which, such services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities will 
be provided under any such program or the class of individuals to be 
afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not, 
directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria 
or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting 
individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national 
origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing 
accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respects individuals 
of a particular race, color, or national origin.
    (3) In determining the site or location of facilities, an applicant 
or recipient may not make selections with the purpose or effect of 
excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting 
them to discrimination under any of its activities or programs to which 
the regulations in this part apply, on the grounds of race, color, or 
national origin; or with the purpose or effect of defeating or 
substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the Act 
and the regulations in this part.
    (4) As used in this section, the services, financial aid, or other 
benefit provided under a program or activity of an applicant or 
recipient receiving Federal financial assistance shall be deemed to 
include any and all services, financial aid, or other benefit provided 
in or through a facility provided or improved in whole or part with the 
aid of Federal financial assistance.
    (5) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination 
in these regulations does not limit the applicability of the provisions 
of paragraph (a) of this section.
    (6)(i) In administering a program regarding which the recipient has 
previously discriminated against persons on the ground of race, color, 
or national origin, the recipient must take affirmative action to 
overcome the effects of prior discrimination.

[[Page 352]]

    (ii) Even in the absence of such prior discrimination, a recipient 
in administering a program may take affirmative action to overcome the 
effects of conditions which resulted in limiting participation by 
persons of a particular race, color or national origin.
    (c) Employment practices. Where a primary objective of the Federal 
financial assistance to a program to which the regulations in this part 
apply is to provide employment, a recipient may not, directly or through 
contractual or other arrangements, subject an individual to 
discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in its 
employment practices under the program including recruitment or 
recruitment advertising, employment, layoff or termination, upgrading, 
demotion, or transfer, rates of pay or other forms of compensation, and 
use of facilities. This paragraph applies to programs where a primary 
objective of the Federal financial assistance is (1) to reduce 
unemployment, (2) to assist individuals in meeting expenses incident to 
the commencement or continuation of their education or training, or (3) 
to provide work experience which contributes to education or training. 
Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is not to 
provide employment, but discrimination on the grounds of race, color, or 
national origin in the employment practices of the recipient or other 
persons subject to the regulations in this part, tends, on the grounds 
of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from 
participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to 
discrimination under any program or activity of the applicant or 
recipient to which these regulations apply, the foregoing provisions of 
this Sec. 15.3(c) shall apply to the employment practices of the 
recipient or other persons subject to these regulations, to the extent 
necessary to assure equality of opportunity to, and nondiscriminatory 
treatment of, beneficiaries. The requirements applicable to construction 
employment under any program or activity of the applicant or recipient 
shall be those specified in or pursuant to part III of Executive Order 
11246 or any Executive order which supersedes it.
    (d) Examples. In order that all parties may have a clear 
understanding of the applicability of the regulations in this part to 
their activities, there are listed in this section programs and 
activities together with illustrations, by way of example only, of types 
of activity covered by the regulations in this part. These illustrations

limited to that program alone and the prohibited actions described may

Sec. 15.4  Assurances required.

    (a) General. (1) Every application for Federal financial assistance 
to carry out a program to which these regulations apply, except a 
program to which paragraph (b) of this section applies, and every 
application for Federal financial assistance to provide a facility, 
shall as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal 
financial assistance pursuant to the application, contain or be 
accompanied by an assurance that the applicant's program or activity 
will be conducted or the facility operated in compliance with all 
requirements imposed by or pursuant to the Act and the regulations in 
this part. In the case where the Federal financial assistance is to 
provide or is in the form of personal property, or real property or 
interest therein, or structures thereon, the assurance shall obligate 
the recipient, or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, 
for the period during which the property is used for the purpose for 
which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another 
purpose involving the provision of similar services and benefits or for 
as long as the recipient retains ownership or possession of the 
property, whichever is longer. In all other cases, the assurance shall 
obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial 
assistance is extended pursuant to the application. The Agency shall 
specify the form of the foregoing assurances and the extent to which 
like assurances will be required of subgrantees, contractors, and 
subcontractors, successors in interest and other participants. Any such 
assurance shall include provisions which give the United States a right 
to seek its judicial enforcement.
    (2) In the case of real property, structures, or improvements 
thereon, or interests therein, which was acquired through Federal 
financial assistance, or in the case where Federal financial assistance 
is provided in the form of a transfer of real property or interest 
therein from the Federal Government, the instrument effecting or 
recording the transfer shall contain a covenant running with the land 
assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property 
is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is 
extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar 
services or benefits, or for as long as the recipient retains ownership 
or possession of the property, whichever is longer. Where no transfer of 
property is involved, but property is improved through Federal financial 
assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such a covenant in any 
subsequent transfer of such property. Where the property is obtained 
from the Federal Government, such covenant may also include a condition 
coupled with a right to be reserved by the Agency to revert title to the 
property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the 
discretion of the Agency concerned, such a condition and right of 
reverter is appropriate to the purposes of the Federal financial 
assistance under which the real property is obtained and to the nature 
of the grant and the grantee. In such event, if a transferee of real 
property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as 
security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, 
facilities on such property for the purposes for which the property was 
transferred, the Agency may agree, upon request of the transferee and if 
necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such conditions as it 
deems appropriate to forbear the exercise of such right to revert title 
for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance remains 
effective.
    (3) Transfers of surplus property are subject to regulations issued 
by the Administrator of General Services (41 CFR 101-6.2).
    (b) Every application by a State or a State Agency, including a 
State Extension Service, but not including an application for aid to an 
institution of higher education, to carry out its program or activity 
involving continuing Federal financial assistance to which the 
regulations in this part apply shall as a condition to its approval and 
the exension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the 
application (1) contain or be accompanied by a statement that the 
program is (or, in the case of a new program, will be) conducted in 
compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part, 
and (2) provide or be accompanied

[[Page 356]]

by provision for such methods of administration for the program as are 
found by the Agency to give reasonable assurance that the applicant and 
all recipients of Federal financial assistance under such program will 
comply with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to the regulations 
in this part: Provided, That where no application is required prior to 
payment, the State or State Agency, including a State Extension Service, 
shall, as a condition to the extension of any Federal financial 
assistance, submit an assurance complying with the requirements of 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.
    (c) Assurances from institutions. The assurance required with 
respect to an institution of higher education, or any other institution, 
insofar as the assurance relates to the institution's practices with 
respect to admission or other treatment of individuals or to the 
opportunity to participate in the provision of services or other 
benefits to such individuals, shall be applicable to the entire 
institution unless the applicant establishes, to the satisfaction of the 
Agency, that the institution's practices in designated parts or programs 
of the institution will in no way affect its practices in the program of 
the institution for which Federal financial assistance is sought, or the 
beneficiaries of or participants in such program. If in any such case 
the assistance sought is for the construction of a facility or part of a 
facility, the assurance shall in any event extend to the entire facility 
and to facilities operated in connection therewith.
    (d) Recipients other than applicants. Each recipient not required to 
submit an application for Federal financial assistance, shall furnish, 
as a condition to the extension of any such assistance, an assurance or 
statement as is required of applicants under paragraphs (a), (b)(1) and 
(2) of this section.
    (e) Elementary and secondary schools. The requirements of paragraphs 
(a), (b), or (d) of this section with respect to any elementary or 
secondary school or school system shall be deemed to be satisfied if 
such school or school system (1) is subject to a final order of a court 
of the United States for the desegregation of such school or school 
system, and provides an assurance that it will comply with such order, 
including any future modification of such order, or (2) submits a plan 
for the desegregation of such school or school system which the 
responsible official of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare 
determines is adequate to accomplish the purposes of the Act and this 
part, and provides reasonable assurance that it will carry out such 
plan; in any case of continuing Federal financial assistance the said 
responsible official of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare 
may reserve the right to redetermine, after such period as may be 
specified by him, the adequacy of the plan to accomplish the purposes of 
the Act and this part within the earliest practical time. In any case in 
which a final order of a court of the United States for the 
desegregation of such school or school system is entered after 
submission of such a plan, such plan shall be revised to conform to such 
final order, including any future modification of such order.

Sec. 15.5  Compliance.

    (a) Cooperation and assistance. Each Agency shall to the fullest 
extent practicable seek the cooperation of recipients in obtaining 
compliance with the regulations and this part and shall provide 
assistance and guidance to recipients to help them comply voluntarily 
with the regulations in this part. As a normal part of the 
administration of programs covered by the regulations in this part, 
designated personnel will in their program reviews and other activities 
or as specifically directed by the Agency, review the activities of 
recipients to determine whether they are complying with the regulations 
in this part. Reports by such personnel shall include statements 
regarding compliance and instances, if any, of noncompliance. In the 
event of noncompliance, the Agency shall seek to secure voluntary 
compliance by all appropriate means.
    (b) Compliance reports. Each recipient shall keep such records and 
submit to the Agency timely, complete and accurate compliance reports at 
such times,

[[Page 357]]

and in such form and containing such information, as the Agency may 
determine to be necessary to ascertain whether the recipient has 
complied or is complying with the regulations in this part. In the case 
of any program under which a primary recipient extends Federal financial 
assistance to any other recipient, such other recipient shall also 
submit such compliance reports to the primary recipient as may be 
necessary to enable the primary recipient to carry out its obligations 
under the regulations in this part. In general, recipients should have 
available for the Agency racial and ethnic data showing the extent to 
which members of minority groups are beneficiaries of federally assisted 
programs.
    (c) Access to sources of information. Each recipient shall permit 
access by authorized employees of this Department during normal business 
hours to such of its books, records, accounts, and other sources of 
information, and its facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain 
compliance with the regulations in this part. Where any information 
required of a recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other 
agency, institution or person and this agency, institution or person 
shall fail or refuse to furnish this information, the recipient shall so 
certify in its report and shall set forth what efforts it has made to 
obtain the information.
    (d) Information to beneficiaries and participants. Each recipient 
shall make available to participants, beneficiaries, and other 
interested persons such information regarding the provisions of the 
regulations in this part and their applicability to the program under 
which the recipient receives Federal financial assistance, and make such 
information available to them in such manner, as the Department or its 
Agencies finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections 
against discrimination assured them by the Act and the regulations in 
this part.

Sec. 15.6  Complaints.

    Any person who believes himself/herself or any specific class of 
individuals to be subjected to discrimination prohibited by the 
regulations in this part may by himself/herself or by an authorized 
representative file with the Secretary or any Agency a written 
complaint. A complaint must be filed not later than 180 days from the 
date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is 
extended by the Agency or by the Secretary. Such complaint shall be 
promptly referred to the Assistant Secretary for Administration. The 
complaint shall be investigated in the manner determined by the 
Assistant Secretary for Administration and such further action taken by 
the Agency or the Secretary as may be warranted.

[50 FR 25687, June 21, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 15.7  Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited.

    No recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or 
discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with 
any right or privilege secured by section 601 of the Act or the 
regulations in this part, or because he has made a complaint, testified, 
assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, 
or hearing under the regulations in this part. The identity of 
complainants shall be kept confidential except to the extent necessary 
to carry out the purposes of the regulations in this part, including the 
conduct of any hearing or judicial proceeding arising thereunder.


<R05>
Sec. 15.8  Procedure for effecting compliance.

    (a) General. If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure 
to comply with the regulations in this part, and if the noncompliance or 
threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, 
compliance with the regulations in this part may be effected by the 
suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal 
financial assistance, upon a finding, in accordance with the procedure 
hereinafter prescribed, or by any other means authorized by law. Such 
other means may include, but are not limited to, (1) a reference to the 
Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings 
be brought to enforce any rights of the United States

[[Page 358]]

under any law of the United States (including other titles of the Act), 
or any assurance or other contractual undertaking, and (2) any 
applicable proceeding under State or local law.
    (b) Noncompliance with Sec. 15.4. If an applicant fails or refuses 
to furnish an assurance required under Sec. 15.4 or otherwise fails or 
refuses to comply with the requirements imposed by or pursuant to that 
section, Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with 
the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. The Department shall 
not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency 
of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph, except that the 
Department shall continue assistance during the pendency of such 
proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an 
application therefor approved prior to the effective date of the 
regulations in this part.
    (c) Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal 
financial assistance. No order suspending, terminating, or refusing to 
grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective 
until (1) the Agency has advised the applicant or recipient of his 
failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured 
by voluntary means, (2) there has been an express finding on the record, 
after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or 
recipient to comply with the requirement imposed by or pursuant to the 
regulations in this part, (3) the action has been approved by the 
Secretary pursuant to Sec. 15.10(e), and (4) the expiration of 30 days 
after the Secretary has filed with the committee of the House and the 
committee of the Senate, having legislative jurisdiction over the 
program involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the 
grounds for such action. Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse 
to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to 
the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or 
recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited 
in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such 
noncompliance has been so found.
    (d) Other means authorized by law. No action to effect compliance by 
any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) the Secretary 
has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) 
the recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply 
and of the action to be taken to effect compliance, and (3) the 
expiration of at least ten days from the mailing of such notice to the 
recipient or other person. During this period of at least ten days, 
additional efforts shall be made to persuade the recipient or other 
person to comply with the regulations in this part and to take such 
corrective action as may be appropriate.

Sec. 15.9  Hearings.

    (a) Opportunity for hearing. Whenever an opportunity for a hearing 
is required under the regulations in this part, reasonable notice shall 
be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to 
the affected applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the 
applicant or recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific 
provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and 
the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and 
either (1) fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such 
notice within which the applicant or recipient may request of the 
Secretary or the Agency that the matter be scheduled for hearing or (2) 
advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been 
set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and place so 
fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The 
complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the 
hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit 
written information and argument for the record. The failure of an 
applicant or recipient to request a hearing under this subsection or to 
appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be 
a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 602 of the Act and the 
regulations in this part and consent to the making of a decision on the 
basis of such information as is available.

[[Page 359]]

    (b) Time and place of hearing. Hearings shall be held at the offices 
of the Department in Washington, DC, at a time fixed by the hearing 
officer or by the Secretary unless it is determined that the convenience 
of the applicant or recipient or of the Department requires that another 
place be selected. Hearings shall be held before a hearing officer.
    (c) Right to counsel. In all proceedings under this section, the 
applicant or recipient and the Department shall have the right to be 
represented by counsel.
    (d) Procedures, evidence, and record. (1) The hearing, decision, and 
any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with 
5 U.S.C. 554-557, and in accordance with such rules of procedure 
promulgated by the Secretary as not inconsistent with this section, 
relating to the conduct of the hearing, giving of notices subsequent to 
those provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, taking of 
testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, requests for findings, and 
other related matters. Both the Department, and the applicant or 
recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the 
issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the 
hearing officer conducting the hearing at the outset of or during the 
hearing.
    (2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings 
conducted pursuant to these regulations in this part, but rules or 
principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence 
available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be 
applied where reasonably necessary by the hearing officer. The hearing 
officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious 
evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the 
record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall 
be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the 
issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the 
extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions 
shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be 
made.
    (e) Consolidated or joint hearings. In cases in which the same or 
related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with these 
regulations with respect to two or more programs to which the 
regulations in this part apply, or noncompliance with the regulations in 
this part and the regulations of one or more other Federal Departments 
or Agencies issued under title VI of the Act, the Secretary may, by 
agreement with such other Departments or Agencies, where applicable 
provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the 
application to such hearings of rules of procedure not inconsistent with 
the regulations in this part. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as 
the regulations in this part are concerned, shall be made in accordance 
with Sec. 15.10.

<R05>
Sec. 15.10  Decisions and notices.

    (a) Decision by hearing officer or Secretary. (1) The hearing 
officer shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or 
certify the entire record including his recommended findings, and 
proposed decision to the Secretary for a final decision, and a copy of 
such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the applicant 
or recipient. The applicant or recipient may within 30 days of the 
mailing of such notice of initial decision file with the Secretary his 
exceptions to the initial decision, with his reasons therefor.
    (2) In the absence of exceptions, the Secretary may on his own 
motion within 45 days after the initial decision serve on the applicant 
or recipient a notice that he will review the decision. Upon the filing 
of such exceptions or of such notice of review the Secretary shall 
review the initial decision and issue his own decision thereon including 
the reasons therefor. In the absence of either exceptions or a notice of 
review the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the 
Secretary.
    (b) Decisions on record or review. Whenever a record is certified to 
the Secretary for decision or he reviews the decision of a hearing 
officer pursuant to paragraph (a), the applicant or recipient shall be 
given reasonable opportunity to file with him briefs or

[[Page 360]]

other written statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final 
decision of the Secretary shall be given in writing to the applicant or 
recipient, and to the complainant, if any.
    (c) Decisions on record where a hearing is waived. Whenever a 
hearing is waived pursuant to Sec. 15.9(a), a decision shall be made by 
the Secretary on the record and a copy of such decision shall be given 
in writing to the applicant or recipient, and to the complainant, if 
any.
    (d) Rulings required. Each decision of a hearing officer shall set 
forth his ruling on each finding, conclusion, or exception presented, 
and shall identify the requirement or requirements imposed by or 
pursuant to the regulations in this part with which it is found that the 
applicant or recipient has failed to comply.
    (e) Decision by Secretary. The Secretary shall make any final 
decision which provides for the suspension or termination of, or the 
refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, or the 
imposition of any other sanction available under the regulations in this 
part or the Act.
    (f) Content of orders. The final decision may provide for suspension 
or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial 
assistance, in whole or in part, under the program involved, and may 
contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent 
with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and the regulations in 
this part, including provisions designed to assure that no Federal 
financial assistance will thereafter be extended under such program to 
the applicant or recipient determined by such decision to be in default 
in its performance of an assurance given by it pursuant to the 
regulations in this part, or to have otherwise failed to comply with the 
regulations in this part, unless and until it corrects its noncompliance 
and satisfies the Agency that it will fully comply with the regulations 
in this part.
    (g) Post termination proceedings. (1) An applicant or recipient 
adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this 
section shall be restored to full eligibilty to receive Federal 
financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that 
order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with 
the Act and the regulations in this part and provides reasonable 
assurance that it will fully comply therewith. An elementary or 
secondary school or school system which is unable to file an assurance 
of compliance with Sec. 15.4 (a), (b), or (d) shall be restored to full 
eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it complies with 
the requirements of a Sec. 15.4(e) and is otherwise in compliance with 
the Act and the regulations in this part.
    (2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order 
entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time 
request the Secretary to restore fully its eligibility to receive 
Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by 
information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the 
requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the Secretary 
determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he shall restore 
such eligibility.
    (3) If the Secretary denies any such request, the applicant or 
recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why 
it believes the denial to have been in error. It shall thereupon be 
given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in 
accordance with rules of procedure set forth in subpart C of this part. 
The applicant or recipient will be restored to such eligibility if it 
proves at such a hearing, that it has satisfied the requirements of 
paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph 
are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph 
(f) of this section shall remain in effect.

Sec. 15.11  Judicial review.

    Action taken pursuant to section 602 of the Act is subject to 
judicial review as provided in section 603 of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 15.12  Effect on other regulations; forms and instructions.

    (a) Effect on other regulations. All regulations, orders, or like 
directions heretofore issued by any officer of the

[[Page 361]]

Department which impose requirements designed to prohibit any 
discrimination against individuals on the ground of race, color, or 
national origin under any program to which the regulations in this part 
apply, and which authorize the suspension or termination of or refusal 
to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance to any applicant 
for or recipient of such assistance under such program for failure to 
comply with such requirements, are hereby superseded to the extent that 
such discrimination is prohibited by the regulations in this part, 
except that nothing in the regulations in this part shall be deemed to 
relieve any person of any obligation assumed or imposed under any such 
superseded regulation, order, instruction, or like direction prior to 
the effective date of the regulations in this part. Nothing in these 
regulations, however, shall be deemed to supersede any of the following 
including future amendments thereof:
    (1) Executive Order 11246 and regulations issued thereunder; or
    (2) Executive Order 11063 and regulations issued thereunder or any 
other regulations or instructions insofar as they prohibit 
discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in any 
program or situation to which the regulations in this part are 
inapplicable, or prohibit discrimination on any other ground.
    (b) Forms and instructions. Each Agency shall issue and promptly 
make available forms and such implementing instructions and procedures 
consistent with the regulations in this part as may be necessary. Each 
Agency in making available Federal financial assistance to any program 
or activity may utilize contractual commitments in obtaining compliance 
with the regulations in this part, including obtaining compliance by 
recipients other than the contracting recipient.
    (c) Supervision and coordination. The Secretary may from time to 
time assign to officials of other Departments or Agencies of the 
Government with the consent of such Department or Agency, 
responsibilities in connection with the effectuation of the purposes of 
title VI of the Act and the regulations in this part (other than 
responsibility for final decision as provided in Sec. 15.10) including 
the achievement of effective coordination and maximum uniformity within 
the Department and within the Executive Branch of the Government in the 
application of title VI and these regulations to similar programs and in 
similar situations. Any action taken, determination made, or requirement 
imposed by an official of another Department or Agency acting under this 
paragraph shall have the same effect as though such action had been 
taken by the Secretary or any Agency of this Department.

shall have the right to submit written information and argument for the 
record, and the additional right to further participate in the 
proceeding. Failure to appear at the time set for a hearing, without

recipient shall file an answer. Said answer shall admit or deny each 
allegation of the notice, unless the applicant or recipient is without

    Two or more proceedings against the same respondent, or against 
different respondents in which the same or related facts are asserted to 
constitute noncompliance, may be consolidated for hearing or decision or 
both by the agency head, if he has the principal responsibility within 
the Department for the administration of all the laws extending the 
Federal financial assistance involved. If laws administered by more than 
one agency head are involved, such officials may by agreement order

    (a) General. Motions shall state the relief sought and the authority 
relied upon. If made before or after the hearing, the motion shall be in 
writing and filed with the hearing clerk with a copy to all parties. If

hearing in which case an immediate response may be required. The hearing 
officer may dispose of motions at a prehearing conference.


<R05>
Sec. 15.103  Disposition of motions.

    The hearing officer may not sustain or grant a motion prior to 
expiration of the time for filing responses thereto, but may overrule or 
deny such motion without waiting on a response: Provided, however, That 
prehearing conferences, hearings, and decisions need not be delayed 
pending disposition of motions. Oral motions may be ruled on

separate rulings or in his decision will be deemed denied. Oral argument 
shall not be held on written motions unless expressly ordered. 
Interlocutory appeals from rulings on motions shall be governed by

                           Hearing Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 15.110  Prehearing conferences.

    (a) In any case in which it appears that such procedure will 
expedite the proceeding, the hearing officer may, prior to the 
commencement of the hearing, request the parties to meet with him or to 
correspond with him regarding any of the following:
    (1) Simplification and clarification of the issues;
    (2) Necessity or desirability of amendments to the pleadings;
    (3) Stipulations, admissions of fact and of the contents and 
authenticity of documents;
    (4) Matters of which official notice will be taken;
    (5) Limitation of the number of experts or other witnesses;
    (6) Disposal of all motions; and
    (7) Such other matters as may expedite and aid in the disposition of 
the proceeding.
    (b) The hearing officer shall enter in the record a written summary 
of the results of the conference or correspondence with the parties.


<R05>
Sec. 15.111  Purpose of hearing.

    (a) The hearing is directed to receiving factual evidence and expert 
opinion testimony related to the issues in the proceeding. Argument will 
not be received in evidence; rather it should be presented in 
statements, memoranda or briefs, as determined by the hearing officer. 
Brief opening statements, which shall be limited to a statement of the 
party's position and what he intends to prove, may also be made at 
hearings.
    (b) Hearings for the reception of evidence will be held only in 
cases where issues of fact must be resolved in order to determine 
whether the respondent

[[Page 371]]

has failed to comply with one or more applicable requirements of subpart 
A of this part. In any case where it appears from the answer of the 
applicant or recipient to the notice of hearing or notice of opportunity 
to request a hearing, from his failure timely to answer, or from his 
admissions or stipulations in the record that there are no matters of 
material fact in dispute, the hearing officer may enter an order so 
finding, and fixing the time for the submission of evidence by the 
Government for the record. Thereafter, the proceedings shall go to 
conclusion in accordance with subpart A of this part and the rules of 
this subpart. An appeal from such order may be allowed in accordance 
with the rules for interlocutory appeal in Sec. 15.123.


<R05>
Sec. 15.112  Statement of position and brief.

    The hearing officer may require all parties and any intervener to 
file a written statement of position or brief prior to the beginning of 
a hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 15.113  Testimony.

    (a) Testimony shall be given orally under oath or affirmation by 
witnesses at the hearing, but the hearing officer, in his discretion, 
may require or permit that the testimony of any witness be prepared in 
writing and served on all parties in advance of the hearing. Such 
testimony may be adopted by the witness at the hearing and filed as part 
of the record thereof. Unless authorized by the hearing officer, 
witnesses will not be permitted to read prepared testimony into the 
record. Except as provided in Secs. 15.115 and 15.116, witnesses shall 
be available at the hearing for cross-examination.
    (b) Proposed exhibits shall be exchanged either at a prehearing 
conference, or otherwise prior to the hearing. Proposed exhibits not so 
exchanged may be denied admission as evidence unless good cause is shown 
why they were not exchanged. The authenticity of all proposed exhibits 
exchanged prior to hearing will be deemed admitted unless written 
objection thereto is filed prior to the hearing or unless good cause is 
shown at the hearing for failure to file such written objection.


<R05>
Sec. 15.115  Affidavits.

    An affidavit, intended to be used as evidence without cross-
examination of the affiant, will be filed and served on the parties at 
least 15 days prior to the hearing; and not less than seven days prior 
to hearing a party may file and serve written objections to any 
affidavit on the ground that he believes it necessary to test the truth 
of assertions therein by cross-examination. In such event, the affidavit 
objected to will not be received in evidence unless the affiant is made 
available for cross-examination at the hearing or otherwise as 
prescribed by the hearing officer. In absence of an objection being 
filed within the time specified, such affidavit will be received in 
evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 15.116  Depositions.

    Upon such terms as may be just, the hearing officer, in his 
discretion, may authorize the testimony of any witness to be taken by 
deposition.


<R05>
Sec. 15.117  Evidence.

    Irrelevant, immaterial, unreliable, and unduly repetitious evidence 
will be excluded, and technical rules of evidence shall not apply but 
rules or principles designed to assure the most credible evidence 
available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall 
apply.


<R05>
Sec. 15.118  Cross-examination.

    Cross-examination will be limited to the scope of direct examination 
and matters at issue in the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 15.119  Objections.

    Objections to evidence shall be timely and briefly state the ground 
relied upon. The ruling of the hearing officer will be part of the 
record. Argument in support of the objection will not be part of the 
record.


<R05>
Sec. 15.120  Exceptions to rulings of hearing officer unnecessary.

    Exceptions to rulings of the hearing officer are unnecessary. It is 
sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling of the hearing officer 
is sought, makes known the action which he desires the hearing officer 
to take, or his objection

[[Page 372]]

to an action taken, and his grounds therefor.


<R05>
Sec. 15.121  Official notice.

    A public document, or part thereof, such as an official report 
decision, opinion, or published scientific or economic statistical data 
issued by any branch of the Federal or a State Government which has been 
shown to be reasonably available to the public, may be offered for 
official notice and accepted in the record without further proof of 
authenticity. Where official notice is to be taken, any party, on timely 
request, shall have an opportunity to show the contrary.


<R05>
Sec. 15.122  Offer of proof.

    An offer of proof made in connection with an objection taken to any 
ruling of the hearing officer rejecting or excluding proposed oral 
testimony shall consist of a statement for the record of the substance 
of the evidence which counsel contends would be adduced by such 
testimony; and, if the excluded evidence consists of evidence in 
documentary or written form or of reference to documents or records, a 
copy of such evidence shall be marked for identification and shall 
accompany the record as an offer of proof.


<R05>
Sec. 15.123  Appeals from ruling of hearing officer.

    A ruling of the hearing officer may not be appealed to the Secretary 
prior to consideration of the entire proceeding by the hearing officer 
except with the consent of the hearing officer and where he certifies on 
the record or in writing that the allowance of an interlocutory appeal 
is clearly necessary to prevent exceptional delay, expense, or prejudice 
to any part or substantial detriment to the public interest. If an 
appeal is allowed, any party may file a brief with the Secretary within 
such period as the hearing officer directs. Oral argument will be heard 
in the discretion of the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 15.124  Admissions as to facts and documents.

    Not later than 15 days prior to the scheduled date of the hearing 
except for good cause shown, or prior to such earlier date as the 
hearing officer may order, any party may serve upon an opposing party a 
written request for the admission of the genuineness and authenticity of 
any relevant documents described in and exhibited with the request, or 
for the admission of the truth of any relevant matters of fact stated in 
the request. Each of the matters of which an admission is requested 
shall be deemed admitted, unless within a period designated in the 
request (not less than 10 days after service thereof, or within such 
further time as the hearing officer may allow upon motion and notice) 
the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the requesting 
party a sworn statement either denying specifically the matters of which 
an admission is requested or setting forth in detail the reasons why he 
cannot truthfully either admit or deny such matters. Copies of requests 
for admission and answers thereto shall be served on all parties. Any 
admission made by a party to such request is only for the purposes of 
the pending proceeding, or any proceeding or action instituted for the 
enforcement of any order entered therein, and shall not constitute an 
admission by him for any other purpose or be used against him in any 
other proceeding or action.

contain or be accompanied by an assurance from the applicant or 
recipient, satisfactory to the Secretary, that each education program or 
activity operated by the applicant or recipient and to which this part

the applicant or recipient to whom such assurance applies fails to 
commit itself to take whatever remedial action is necessary in 
accordance with Sec. 15a.3(a) to eliminate existing discrimination on 
the basis of sex or to eliminate the effects of past discrimination 
whether occurring prior or subsequent to the submission to the Secretary 
of such assurance.
    (b) Transfers of property. If a recipient sells or otherwise

Government both the transferor and the transferee shall be deemed to be 
recipients, subject to the provisions of subpart B.
    (c) Duration of obligation. (1) In the case of Federal financial 
assistance extended to provide real property or structures thereon, such 
assurance shall obligate the recipient or, in the case of a subsequent 
transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property

for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended.
    (d) Form. The Secretary will specify the form of the assurances 
required by paragraph (a) of this section and the extent to which such 
assurances will be required of the applicant's or recipient's 
subgrantees, contractors, subcontractors, transferees, or successors in 
interest.


<R05>
Sec. 15a.5  Effect of other requirements.

    (a) Effect of other Federal provisions. The obligations imposed by 
this part are independent of, and do not alter, obligations not to 
discriminate on the basis of sex imposed by Executive Order 11246, as 
amended; title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et 
seq.); the Equal Pay Act (29 U.S.C. 206 and 206(d); and any other act of 
Congress or Federal regulation.
    (b) Effect of State or local law or other requirements. The 
obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or alleviated by any 
State or local law or other requirement which would render any applicant 
or student ineligible, or limit the eligibility of any applicant or 
student, on the basis of sex to practice any occupation or profession.
    (c) Effect of rules or regulations of private organizations. The 
obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or alleviated by any 
rule or regulation of any organization, club, athletic or other league, 
or association which would render any applicant or student ineligible to 
participate or limit the eligibility or participation of any applicant 
or student, on the basis of sex,

[[Page 378]]

in any education program or activity operated by a recipient and which 
receives or benefits from Federal financial assistance.
    (d) Effect of compliance with HEW regulations. If a recipient is 
covered by the title IX regulations issued by HEW, 45 CFR part 86, and 
has already complied with the HEW requirements corresponding to 
Secs. 15a.3(c), 15a.4(a), 15a.7 (a) and (b), and 15a.8 (a) and (b), then 
the requirements of those sections need not be duplicated in order to 
comply with this part. However, if the requirements have not been 
applied to all programs funded by this Department, then the requirements 
will have to be met as to those programs.


<R05>
Sec. 15a.6  Effect of employment opportunities.

    The obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or 
alleviated because employment opportunities in any occupation or 
profession are or may be more limited for members of one sex than for 
members of the other sex.


<R05>
Sec. 15a.7  Designation of responsible employee and adoption of grievance procedures.

    (a) Designation of responsible employee. Each recipient shall 
designate at least one employee to coordinate its efforts to comply with 
and carry out its responsibilities under this part, including any 
investigation of any complaint communicated to such recipient alleging 
its noncompliance with this part or alleging any actions which would be 
prohibited by this part. The recipient shall notify all its students and 
employees of the name, office address and telephone number of the 
employee or employees appointed pursuant to this paragraph.
    (b) Complaint procedure of recipient. A recipient shall adopt and 
publish grievance procedures providing for prompt, and equitable 
resolution of student and employee complaints alleging any action which 
would be prohibited by this part.

    (a) Notification of policy. (1) Each recipient shall implement 
specific and continuing steps to notify applicants for admission and 
employment, students and parents of elementary and secondary school 
students, employees, sources of referral of applicants for admission and 
employment and all unions or professional organizations holding 
collective bargaining or professional agreements with the recipient, 
that it does not discriminate on the basis of sex in the educational 
programs or activities which it operates, and that it is required by 
title IX and this part not to discriminate in such a manner. Such 
notification shall contain such information, and be made in such manner, 
as the Secretary finds necessary to apprise such persons of the 
protections against discrimination assured them by title IX and this 
part, but shall state at least that the requirement not to discriminate 
in education programs and activities extends to employment therein and 
to admission thereto unless subpart C does not apply to the recipient, 
and that inquiries concerning the application of title IX and this part 
to such recipient may be referred to the employee designated pursuant to 
Sec. 15a.7 or to the Secretary.
    (2) Each recipient shall make the initial notification required by 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section within 90 days of the effective date of 
this part or of the date this part first applies to such recipient, 
whichever comes later, which notification shall include publication in:
    (i) Local newspapers,
    (ii) newspapers and magazines operated by such recipient or by 
student, alumnae, or alumni groups for or in connection with such 
recipient; and
    (iii) memoranda or other written communications distributed to every 
student and employees of such recipient.
    (b) Publications. (1) Each recipient shall prominently include a 
statement of the policy described in paragraph (a) of this section in 
each announcement, bulletin, catalog, or application form which it makes 
available to any person of a type described in paragraph (a) of this 
section, or which is otherwise used in connection with the recruitment 
of students or employees.
    (2) A recipient shall not use or distribute a publication of the 
type described in this paragraph which suggests, by text or 
illustration, that such

[[Page 379]]

recipient treats applicants, students, employees differently on the 
basis of sex except as such treatment is permitted by this part.
    (c) Distribution. Each recipient shall distribute without 
discrimination on the basis of sex each publication described in 
paragraph (b) of this section, and shall apprise each of its admission 
and employment recruitment representatives of the policy of 
nondiscrimination described in paragraph (a) of this section, and 
require such representatives to adhere to such policy.

disproportionately adverse effect are shown to be unavailable.
    (c) Prohibitions relating to marital or parental status. In 
determining whether a person satisfies any policy or criterion for 
admission, or in making any offer of admission, a recipient to which

same policies and criteria of admission, courses, services, and 
facilities comparable to each course, service, and facility offered in 
or through such schools.


<R05>
Sec. 15a.36  Counseling and use of appraisal and counseling materials.

    (a) Counseling. A recipient shall not discriminate against any 
person on the basis of sex in the counseling or guidance of students or 
applicants for admission.
    (b) Use of appraisal and counseling materials. A recipient which 
uses testing or other materials for appraising or counseling students 
shall not use different materials for students on the basis of their sex 
or use materials which permit or require different treatment of students 
on such basis unless such different materials cover the same occupations 
and interest areas and the use of such different materials is shown to 
be essential to eliminate sex bias. Recipients shall develop and use 
internal procedures for ensuring that such materials do not discriminate 
on the basis of sex. Where the use of a counseling test or other 
instrument results in a substantially disproportionate number of members 
of one sex in any particular course of study or classification, the 
recipient shall take such action as is necessary to assure itself that 
such disproportion is not the result of discrimination in the instrument 
or its application.
    (c) Disproportion in classes. Where a recipient finds that a 
particular class contains a substantially disproportionate number of 
individuals of one sex, the recipient shall take such action as is 
necessary to assure itself that such disproportion is not the result of 
discrimination on the basis of sex in counseling or appraisal materials 
or by counselors.


<R05>
Sec. 15a.37  Financial assistance.

    (a) General. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section, in providing financial assistance to any of its students, a 
recipient shall not:
    (1) On the basis of sex, provide different amounts or types of such 
assistance, limit eligibility for such assistance which is of any 
particular type or source, apply different criteria or otherwise 
discriminate;
    (2) Through solicitation, listing, approval, provision of facilities 
or other services, assist any foundation, trust, agency, organization, 
or person which provides assistance to any of such recipient's students 
in a manner which discriminates on the basis of sex; or
    (3) Apply any rule or assist in application of any rule concerning 
eligibility for such assistance which treats persons of one sex 
differently from persons of the other sex with regard to marital or 
parental status.
    (b) Financial aid established by certain legal instruments. (1) A 
recipient may administer or assist in the administration of 
scholarships, fellowships, or other forms of financial assistance 
established pursuant to domestic or foreign wills, trusts, bequests or 
similar legal instruments or by acts of a foreign government which 
require that awards be made to members of a particular sex specified 
therein: Provided, That the overall effect of the award of such sex-
restricted scholarships, fellowships and other forms of financial 
assistance does not discriminate on the basis of sex.
    (2) To ensure nondiscriminatory awards of assistance as required in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, recipients shall develop and use 
procedures under which:
    (i) Students are selected for award of financial assistance on the 
basis of nondiscriminatory criteria and not on the basis of availability 
of funds restricted to members of a particular sex;
    (ii) An appropriate sex-restricted scholarship, fellowship, or other 
form of financial assistance is allocated to each student selected under 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section; and
    (iii) No student is denied the award for which he or she was 
selected under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section because of the 
absence of a scholarship, fellowship, or other form of financial 
assistance designed for a member of that student's sex.
    (c) Athletic scholarships. (1) To the extent that a recipient awards 
athletic scholarships or grants-in-aids, it must provide reasonable 
opportunities for such awards for members of each sex in proportion to 
the number of students

[[Page 385]]

of each sex participating in interscholastic or intercollegiate 
athletics.
    (2) Separate athletic scholarships or grants-in-aid for members of 
each sex may be provided as part of separate athletic teams for members 
of each sex to the extent consistent with this paragraph and 
Sec. 15a.41.


<R05>
Sec. 15a.38  Employment assistance to students.

    (a) Assistance by recipient in making available outside employment. 
A recipient which assists any agency, organization or person in making 
employment available to any of its students:
    (1) Shall assure itself that such employment is made available 
without discrimination on the basis of sex; and
    (2) Shall not render such services to any agency, organization, or 
person which discriminates on the basis of sex in its employment 
practices.
    (b) Employment of students by recipients. A recipient which employs 
any of its students shall not do so in a manner which violates subpart 
E.


<R05>
Sec. 15a.39  Health and insurance benefits and services.

    In providing a medical, hospital, accident, or life insurance 
benefit, service, policy, or plan to any of its students, a recipient 
shall not discriminate on the basis of sex, or provide such benefit, 
service, policy, or plan in a manner which would violate subpart E if it 
were provided to employees of the recipient. This section shall not 
prohibit a recipient from providing any benefit or service which may be 
used by a different proportion of students of one sex than of the other, 
including family planning services. However, any recipient which 
provides full coverage health service shall provide gynecological care.


<R05>
Sec. 15a.40  Marital or parental status.

    (a) Status generally. A recipient shall not apply any rule 
concerning a student's actual or potential parental, family, or marital 
status which treats students differently on the basis of sex.
    (b) Pregnancy and related conditions. (1) A recipient shall not 
discriminate against any student, or exclude any student from its 
education program or activity, including any class or extracurricular 
activity on the basis of such student's pregnancy, childbirth, false 
pregnancy, termination of pregnancy or recovery therefrom, unless the 
student requests voluntarily to participate in a separate portion of the 
program or activity of the recipient.
    (2) A recipient may require such a student to obtain the 
certification of a physician that the student is physically and 
emotionally able to continue participation in the normal education 
program or activity so long as such a certification is required of all 
students for other physical or emotional conditions requiring the 
attention of a physician.
    (3) A recipient which operates a portion of its education program or 
activity separately for pregnant students, admittance to which is 
completely voluntary on the part of the student as provided in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section shall ensure that the instructional program in 
the separate program is comparable to that offered to non-pregnant 
students.
    (4) A recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, 
termination of pregnancy and recovery therefrom in the same manner and 
under the same policies as any other temporary disability with respect 
to any medical or hospital benefit, service, plan or policy which such 
recipient administers, operates, offers, or participates in with respect 
to students admitted to the recipient's educational program or activity.
    (5) In the case of a recipient which does not maintain a leave 
policy for its students, or in the case of a student who does not 
otherwise qualify for leave under such a policy, a recipient shall treat 
pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy and 
recovery therefrom as a justification for a leave of absence for so long 
a period of time as is deemed medically necessary by the student's 
physician, at the conclusion of which the student shall be reinstated to 
the status which she held when the leave began.


<R05>
Sec. 15a.41  Athletics.

    (a) General. No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from 
participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from 
another person

[[Page 386]]

or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, 
intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics, offered by the recipient, 
and no recipient shall provide any such athletics separately on such 
basis.
    (b) Separate teams. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph 
(a) of this section, a recipient may operate or sponsor separate teams 
for members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon 
competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport. However, 
where a recipient operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for 
members of one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members of 
the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that sex have 
previously been limited, members of the excluded sex must be allowed to 
try-out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact 
sport. For the purposes of this part, contact sports include boxing, 
wrestling, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and other sports the 
purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact.
    (c) Equal opportunity. A recipient which operates or sponsors 
interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics shall 
provide equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes. In 
determining whether equal opportunities are available the Secretary will 
consider, among other factors:
    (1) Whether the selection of sports and levels of competition 
effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both 
sexes;
    (2) The provision of equipment and supplies;
    (3) Scheduling of games and practice time;
    (4) Travel and per diem allowance;
    (5) Opportunity to receive coaching and academic tutoring;
    (6) Assignment and compensation of coaches and tutors;
    (7) Provision of locker rooms, practice and competitive facilities;
    (8) Provision of medical and training facilities and services;
    (9) Provision of housing and dining facilities and services;
    (10) Publicity.

Unequal aggregate expenditures for members of each sex or unequal 
expenditures for male and female teams if a recipient operates or 
sponsors separate teams will not constitute noncompliance with this 
section, but the Secretary may consider the failure to provide necessary 
funds for teams for one sex in assessing equality of opportunity for 
members of each sex.
    (d) Adjustment period. A recipient which operates or sponsors 
interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics at the 
elementary school level shall comply fully with the section as 
expeditiously as possible but in no event later than one year from the 
effective date of this regulation. A recipient which operates or 
sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics 
at the secondary or post-secondary school level shall comply fully with 
this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than 
three years from the effective date of this regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 15a.42  Textbooks and curricular material.

    Nothing in this regulation shall be interpreted as requiring or 
prohibiting or abridging in any way the use of particular textbooks or 
curricular materials.


<R04>

                   Programs and Activities Prohibited


<R05>
Sec. 15a.51  Employment.

    (a) General. (1) No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded 
from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to 
discrimination in employment, or recruitment, consideration, or 
selection therefor, whether full-time or part-time, under any education 
program or activity operated by a recipient which receives or benefits 
from Federal financial assistance.
    (2) A recipient shall make all employment decisions in any education 
program or activity operated by such recipient in a nondiscriminatory 
manner and shall not limit, segregate, or classify applicants or 
employees in any way which could adversely affect any applicant's or 
employee's employment opportunities or status because of sex.

[[Page 387]]

    (3) A recipient shall not enter into any contractual or other 
relationship which directly or indirectly has the effect of subjecting 
employees or students to discrimination prohibited by this subpart, 
including relationships with employment and referral agencies, with 
labor unions, and with organizations providing or administering fringe 
benefits to employees of the recipient.
    (4) A recipient shall not grant preferences to applicants for 
employment on the basis of attendance at any educational institution or 
entity which admits as students only or predominantly members of one 
sex, if the giving of such preferences has the effect of discriminating 
on the basis of sex in violation of this part.
    (b) Application. The provisions of this subpart apply to:
    (1) Recruitment, advertising, and the process of application for 
employment;
    (2) Hiring, upgrading, promotion, consideration for and award of 
tenure, demotion, transfer, layoff, termination, application of nepotism 
policies, right of return from layoff, and rehiring;
    (3) Rates of pay or any other form of compensation, and changes in 
compensation;
    (4) Job assignments, classifications and structure, including 
position descriptions, lines of progression, and seniority lists;
    (5) The terms of any collective bargaining agreement;
    (6) Granting and return from leaves of absence, leave for pregnancy,

of either sex to care for children or dependents, or any other leave;
    (7) Fringe benefits available by virtue of employment, whether or 
not administered by the recipient;
    (8) Selection and financial support for training, including 
apprenticeship, professional meetings, conferences, and other related 
activities, selection for tuition assistance, selection for sabbaticals 
and leaves of absence to pursue training;
    (9) Employer-sponsored activities, including social or recreational 
programs; and
    (10) Any other term, condition, or privilege of employment.


<R05>
Sec. 15a.52  Employment criteria.

    A recipient shall not administer or operate any test or other 
criterion for any employment opportunity which has a disproportionately 
adverse effect on persons on the basis of sex unless:
    (a) Use of such test or other criterion is shown to predict validly 
successful performance in the position in question; and
    (b) Alternative tests or criteria for such purpose, which do not 
have such disproportionately adverse effect, are shown to be 
unavailable.


<R05>
Sec. 15a.53  Recruitment.

    (a) Nondiscriminatory recruitment and hiring. A recipient shall not 
discriminate on the basis of sex in the recruitment and hiring of 
employees. Where a recipient has been found to be presently 
discriminating on the basis of sex in the recruitment or hiring of 
employees, or has been found to have in the past so discriminated, the 
recipient shall recruit members of the sex so discriminated against so 
as to overcome the effects of such past or present discrimination.
    (b) Recruitment patterns. A recipient shall not recruit primarily or 
exclusively at entities which furnish as applicants only or 
predominantly members of one sex if such actions have the effect of 
discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 15a.54  Compensation.

    A recipient shall not make or enforce any policy or practice which, 
on the basis of sex:
    (a) Makes distinctions in rates of pay or other compensation;
    (b) Results in the payment of wages to employees of one sex at a 
rate less than that paid to employees of the opposite sex for equal work 
on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and 
responsibility, and which are performed under similar working 
conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 15a.55  Job classification and structure.

    A recipient shall not:

[[Page 388]]

    (a) Classify a job as being for males or for females;
    (b) Maintain or establish separate lines of progression, seniority 
lists, career ladders, or tenure systems based on sex; or
    (c) Maintain or establish separate lines of progression, seniority 
systems, career ladders, or tenure systems for similar jobs, position 
descriptions, or job requirements which classify persons on the basis of 
sex, unless sex is a bona-fide occupational qualification for the 
positions in question as set forth in Sec. 15a.61.


<R05>
Sec. 15a.56  Fringe benefits.

    (a) ``Fringe benefits'' defined. For purposes of this part, fringe 
benefits means: Any medical, hospital, accident, life insurance or 
retirement benefit, service, policy or plan, any profit-sharing or bonus 
plan, leave and any other benefit or service of employment not subject 
to the provision of Sec. 15a.54.
    (b) Prohibitions. A recipient shall not:

benefits available to employees or make fringe benefits available to 
spouses, families, or dependents of employees differently upon the basis 
of the employee's sex;
    (2) Administer, operate, offer, or participate in a fringe benefit 
plan which does not provide either for equal periodic benefits for 
members of each sex or for equal contributions to the plan by such 
recipient for members of each sex; or
    (3) Administer, operate, offer, or participate in a pension or 
retirement plan which establishes different optional or compulsory 
retirement ages based on sex or which otherwise discriminates in 
benefits on the basis of sex.


<R05>
Sec. 15a.57  Marital or parental status.

    (a) General. A recipient shall not apply any policy or take any 
employment action:
    (1) Concerning the potential marital, parental, or family status of 
an employee or applicant for employment which treats persons differently 
on the basis of sex; or
    (2) Which is based upon whether an employee or applicant for 
employment is the head of household or principal wage earner in such 
employee's or applicant's family unit.
    (b) Pregnancy. A recipient shall not discriminate against or exclude 
from employment any employee or applicant for employment on the basis of 
pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or 
recovery therefrom.
    (c) Pregnancy as a temporary disability. A recipient shall treat 
pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and 
recovery therefrom and any temporary disability resulting therefrom as 
any other temporary disability for all job-related purposes, including 
commencement, duration and extensions of leave, payment of disability 
income, accrual of seniority and any other benefit or service, and 
reinstatement, and under any fringe benefit offered to employees by 
virtue of employment.
    (d) Pregnancy leave. In the case of a recipient which does not 
maintain a leave policy for its employees, or in the case of an employee 
with insufficient leave or accrued employment time to qualify for leave 
under such a policy, a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, 
false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy and recovery therefrom as a 
justification for a leave of absence without pay for a reasonable period 
of time, at the conclusion of which the employee shall be reinstated to 
the status which she held when the leave began or to a comparable 
position, without decrease in rate of compensation or loss of 
promotional opportunities, or any other right or privilege of 
employment.


<R05>
Sec. 15a.58  Effect of State or local law or other requirements.

    (a) Prohibitory requirements. The obligation to comply with this 
subpart is not obviated or alleviated by the existence of any State or 
local law or other requirement which imposes prohibitions or limits upon 
employment of members of one sex which are not imposed upon members of 
the other sex.
    (b) Benefits. A recipient which provides any compensation service, 
or benefit to members of one sex pursuant to

[[Page 389]]

a State or local law or other requirement shall provide the same 
compensation, service, or benefit to members of the other sex.


<R05>
Sec. 15a.59  Advertising.

    A recipient shall not in any advertising related to employment 
indicate preference, limitation, specification, or discrimination based 
on sex unless sex is a bona-fide occupational qualification for the 
particular job in question.


<R05>
Sec. 15a.60  Pre-employment inquiries.

    (a) Marital status. A recipient shall not make pre-employment 
inquiry as to the marital status of an applicant for employment, 
including whether such applicant is ``Miss or Mrs.''
    (b) Sex. A recipient may make pre-employment inquiry as to the sex 
of an applicant for employment, but only if such inquiry is made equally 
of such applicants of both sexes and if the results of such inquiry are 
not used in connection with discrimination prohibited by this part.


<R05>
Sec. 15a.61  Sex as a bona-fide occupational qualification.

    A recipient may take action otherwise prohibited by this subpart 
provided it is shown that sex is a bona fide occupational qualification 
for that action, such that consideration of sex with regard to such 
action is essential to successful operation of the employment function 
concerned. A recipient shall not take action pursuant to this section 
which is based upon alleged comparative employment characteristics or 
stereotyped characterizations of one or the other sex, or upon 
preference based on sex of the recipient, employees, students, or other 
persons, but nothing contained in this section shall prevent a recipient 
from considering an employee's sex in relation to employment in a locker 
room or toilet facility used only by members of one sex.


<R04>

provided to others;
    (iv) Provide a different or separate aid, benefit or service to

such programs or activities that are not separate or different.
    (4) A recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other 
arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration (i) that

discrimination on the basis of handicap, (ii) that have the purpose or 
effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the 
objectives of the recipient's program with respect to handicapped 
persons, or (iii) that perpetuate the discrimination of another 
recipient if both recipients are subject to common administrative 
control or are agencies of the same State.
    (5) In determining the site or location of a facility, an applicant

program will be operated in compliance with this part. An applicant may 
incorporate these assurances by reference in subsequent applications to 
the Department.
    (b) Duration of obligation. (1) In the case of Federal financial 
assistance extended in the form of real property or to provide real 
property or structures on the property, the assurance will obligate the 
recipient, or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for 
the period during which the real property or structures are used for the 
purpose for which Federal financial assistance is extended or for 
another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits.
    (2) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide 
personal property, the assurance will obligate the recipient for the 
period during which it retains ownership or possession of the property.
    (3) In all other cases, the assurance will obligate the recipient 
for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended.
    (c) Covenants. (1) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in 
the form of real property or interest in the property from the 
Department, the instrument effecting or recording this transfer shall 
contain a covenant running with the land to assure nondiscrimination for 
the period during which the real property is used for the purpose for 
which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another 
purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits.
    (2) Where no transfer of property is involved but property is 
purchased or improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient 
shall agree to include the covenant described in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section in the instrument effecting or recording any subsequent 
transfer of the property.
    (3) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of 
real property or interest in the property from the Department, the

reserved by the Department to revert title to the property in the event 
of a breach of the covenant. If a transferee of real property proposes 
to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for 
financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on 
the property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, 
the Secretary may, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to 
accomplish such financing and upon such conditions as the Secretary 
deems appropriate, agree to forebear the exercise of such right to 
revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other 
encumbrance remains effective.

    (a) Designation of responsible employee. A recipient that employs 
fifteen or more persons shall designate at least one person to 
coordinate its efforts to comply with this part.

respect to complaints from applicants for employment or from applicants 
for admission to postsecondary educational institutions.
    (c) The Secretary may require any recipient with fewer than fifteen 
employees to designate a responsible employee and adopt grievance

services.


<R05>
Sec. 15b.7  Notice of nondiscrimination and accessible services.

    (a) A recipient shall take appropriate initial and continuing steps 
to notify participants, beneficiaries, applicants, and employees,

agreements with the recipient that it does not discriminate on the basis 
of handicap in violation of section 504 and this part. The notification 
shall state,

[[Page 395]]

where appropriate, that the recipient does not discriminate in admission 
or access to, or treatment or employment in, its programs and 
activities. The recipient shall also identify the responsible employee 
designated pursuant to Sec. 15b.6(a), and identify the existence and 
location of accessible services, activities, and facilities. A recipient

days of the effective date of this part. Methods of initial and 
continuing notification may include but are not limited to the posting 
of notices, placement of notices in the recipient's publications, radio

of this paragraph either by including appropriate inserts in existing 
materials and publications or by revising and reprinting the materials

    (a) Remedial action. (1) If the Secretary finds that a recipient has 
discriminated against persons on the basis of handicap in violation of 
section 504 or this part, the recipient shall take such remedial action 
as the Secretary deems necessary to overcome the effects of the 
discrimination.
    (2) Where a recipient is found to have discriminated against persons 
on the basis of handicap in violation of section 504 or this part and 
where another recipient exercises control over the recipient that has 
discriminated, the Secretary, where appropriate, may require either or 
both recipients to take remedial action.
    (3) The Secretary may, where necessary to overcome the effects of 
discrimination in violation of section 504 or this part, require a 
recipient to take remedial action (i) with respect to handicapped 
persons who are no longer participants in the recipient's program but 
who were participants in the program when such discrimination occurred 
or (ii) with respect to handicapped persons who would have been 
participants in the program had the discrimination not occurred, or 
(iii) with respect to handicapped persons presently in the program, but 
not receiving full benefits or equal and integrated treatment within the 
program.
    (b) Voluntary action. A recipient may take steps, in addition to any 
action that is required by this part, to overcome the effects of 
conditions that resulted in limited participation in the recipient's 
program or activity by qualified handicapped persons.
    (c) Self-evaluation. (1) A recipient shall, within one year of the

of the evaluation required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, 
maintain on file, make available for public inspection, and provide to 
the Secretary upon request: (i) A list of the interested persons 
consulted, (ii) a description of areas examined and any problems

Sec. 15b.9  Effect of State or local law or other requirements, and effect of employment opportunities.

    (a) The obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or 
alleviated

the basis of handicap, imposes prohibitions or limits upon the 
eligibility of qualified handicapped persons to receive services or to 
practice any occupation or profession.
    (b) The obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or

by employees readily accessible to and useable by handicapped persons, 
and (2) Job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, 
acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, the provisions of 
readers or interpreters, and other similar actions.
    (c) In determining pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section whether

<R05>
Sec. 15b.14  Employment criteria.

    (a) A recipient may not make use of any employment test or other 
selection criterion that screens out or tends to screen out handicapped 
persons or any class of handicapped persons unless: (1) The recipient 
shows that the test score or other selection criterion, as used by the 
recipient, is job-related for the position in question, and (2) the 
Secretary cannot show that alternative job-related tests or criteria are 
available that do not screen out or tend to screen out as many 
handicapped persons.
    (b) A recipient shall select and administer tests concerning 
employment so as best to ensure that, when administered to an applicant 
or employee who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking 
skills, the test results accurately reflect the applicant's or 
employee's job skills, aptitude, or whatever other factor the test 
purports to measure, rather than reflecting the applicant's or 
employee's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where 
those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure).

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a 
recipient may not conduct a preemployment medical examination or may not

recipient may, however, make preemployment inquiry into an applicant's 
ability to perform job-related functions.
    (b) When a recipient is taking remedial action to correct the 
effects of past discrimination pursuant to Sec. 15b.8(a), when a 
recipient is taking voluntary action to overcome the effects of 
conditions that resulted in limited participation in its federally 
assisted program or activity pursuant to Sec. 15b.8(b), or when a 
recipient is taking affirmative action pursuant to section 503 of the 
Act, the recipient may invite applicants for employment to indicate 
whether and to what extent they are handicapped: Provided, That (1) the 
recipient states clearly on any written questionnaire used for this 
purpose or makes clear orally if no written questionnaire is used that 
the information requested is intended for use solely in connection with 
its remedial action obligations or its voluntary affirmative action 
efforts; and (2) the recipient states clearly that the information is 
being requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential 
as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, that refusal to provide it 
will not subject the applicant or employee to any adverse treatment, and 
that it will be used only in accordance with this part.
    (c) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a recipient for 
conditioning an offer of employment on the results of a medical 
examination conducted prior to the employee's entrance on duty: 
Provided, That (1) all entering employees are subjected to such an 
examination regardless of handicap; and (2) the results of such an 
examination are used only in accordance with the requirements of this 
part.

[[Page 398]]

equipment, reassignment of classes or other services to accessible 
buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery 
of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of exiting 
facilities and construction of new facilities in conformance with the 
requirements of Sec. 15b.19, or any other method that results in making 
its program or activity accessible to qualified handicapped persons. A 
recipient is not required to make structural changes in existing 
facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance 
with paragraph (a) of this section. In choosing among available methods 
for meeting the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a 
recipient shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and 
activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most intergrated 
setting appropriate to obtain the full benefits of the program.
    (c) Small providers. If a recipient with fewer than fifteen 
employees finds, after consultation with a handicapped person seeking 
its services, that there is no method of complying with paragraph (a) of 
this section other than by making a significant alteration in its 
existing facilities, the recipient may, as an alternative, refer the 
handicapped person to other providers of those services that are 
accessible at no additional cost to handicapped persons.
    (d) Application for modification of requirements. Recipients that 
determine after a self-evaluation conducted according to the 
requirements of Sec. 15b.8(c), that program accessibility can only be 
accomplished through substantial modifications which would result in a 
fundamental alteration in the nature of the program, may apply to the 
Secretary for a modification of the requirements of this section.
    (e) Historic preservation programs. Application for waiver of 
program accessibility requirements. (1) In the case of historic 
preservation programs, program accessibility means that, when viewed in 
its entirety, a program is readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. This paragraph does not necessarily require a 
recipient to make each of its existing historic properties or every part 
of an historic property

[[Page 399]]

accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. Methods of achieving 
program accessibility include:
    (i) Making physical alterations which enable handicapped persons to 
have access to otherwise inaccessible areas or features of historic 
properties;
    (ii) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict otherwise 
inaccessible areas or features of historic properties;
    (iii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through 
otherwise inaccessible portions of historic properties;
    (iv) Adopting other innovative methods to achieve program 
accessibility. Because the primary benefit of an historic preservation 
program is the experience of the historic property itself, in taking 
steps to achieve program accessibility, recipients shall give priority 
to those means which make the historic property, or portions thereof 
physicially accessible to handicapped individuals.
    (2) Where program accessibility cannot be achieved without causing a 
substantial impairment of significant historic features, the Secretary 
may grant a waiver of the program accessibility requirement. In 
determining whether program accessibility can be achieved without 
causing a substantial impairment, the Secretary shall consider the 
following factors:
    (i) Scale of property, reflecting its ability to absorb alterations;
    (ii) Use of the property, whether primarily for public or private 
purpose;
    (iii) Importance of the historic features of the property to the 
conduct of the program; and,
    (iv) Cost of alterations in comparison to the increase in 
accessibility.

The Secretary shall periodically review any waiver granted under this 
section and may withdraw it if technological advances or other changes 
so warrant.
    (3) Where the property is federally owned or where Federal funds may 
be used for alterations, the comments of the Advisory Council on 
Historic Preservation shall be obtained when required by section 106 of 
the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 
470), and 36 CFR part 800, prior to effectuation of structural 
alterations.
    (f) Time period. A recipient shall comply with the requirements of 
paragraph (a) of this section within sixty days of the effective date of 
this part except that where structural changes in facilities are 
necessary, such changes shall be made within three years of the 
effective date of this part and as expeditiously as possible.
    (g) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities are necessary to meet the requirement of paragraph (a) of 
this section, a recipient shall develop, within one year of the 
effective date of this part, a transition plan setting forth the steps 
necessary to complete such changes. The plan shall be developed with the 
assistance of interested persons, including handicapped persons or 
organizations representing handicapped persons. A copy of the transition 
plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a 
minimum:
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the recipient's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its program or activity to handicapped 
persons;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
full program accessibility and if the time period of the transition plan 
is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each 
year of the transition period; and
    (4) Identify the person responsible for implementation of the plan.


<R05>
Sec. 15b.19  New construction.

    (a) Design and construction. Each facility or part of a facility 
constructed by, on behalf of, or for the use of a recipient shall be 
designed and constructed in such manner that the facility or part of the 
facility is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons, if 
the construction is commenced after the effective date of this part.
    (b) Alteration. Each facility or part of a facility which is altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of a recipient after the effective date 
of this part in a manner that affects or could affect the usability of 
the facility or part of the facility shall to the maximum extent

[[Page 400]]

feasible, be altered in such manner that the altered portion of the 
facility is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.
    (c) Conformance with Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards. (1) 
Effective as of January 18, 1991, design, construction, or alteration of 
buildings in conformance with sections 3-8 of the Uniform Federal 
Accessibility Standards (USAF) (appendix A to 41 CFR subpart 101-19.6) 
shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of this section with 
respect to those buildings. Departures from particular technical and 
scoping requirements of UFAS by the use of other methods are permitted 
where substantially equivalent or greater access to and usability of the 
building is provided.
    (2) For purposes of this section, section 4.1.6(1)(g) of UFAS shall 
be interpreted to exempt from the requirements of UFAS only mechanical 
rooms and other spaces that, because of their intended use, will not 
require accessibility to the public or beneficiaries or result in the 
employment or residence therein of persons with physical handicaps.
    (3) This section does not require recipients to make building 
alterations that have little likelihood of being accomplished without 
removing or altering a load-bearing structural member.
    (d) Compliance with the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968. Nothing 
in this section of Sec. 15b.18 relieves recipients, whose facilities are 
covered by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 
4151-4157) from their responsibility of complying with the requirements 
of that Act and any implementing regulations.

   Subpart D--Preschool, Elementary, Secondary, Adult, and Extension 
                                Education


<R05>
Sec. 15b.20  Applicability.

    Except as otherwise noted, this subpart applies to public and 
private schools, elementary, secondary, adult, and extension education 
programs and activities that receive Federal financial assistance 
provided by the Department of Agriculture after the effective date of 
this part and to recipients that operate, or that receive Federal 
financial assistance for the operation of, such programs or activities.

[47 FR 25470, June 11, 1982, as amended at 55 FR 52139, Dec. 19, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 15b.21  Location and notification.

    A recipient that operates a public elementary or secondary education 
program shall annually:
    (a) Undertake to identify and locate every qualified handicapped 
person residing in the recipient's jurisdiction who is not receiving a 
public education; and
    (b) Take appropriate steps to notify handicapped persons and their 
parents or guardians of the recipient's duty under this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 15b.22  Free appropriate public education.

    (a) General. A recipient that operates a public elementary or 
secondary education program shall provide a free appropriate public 
education to each qualified handicapped person who is in the recipient's 
jurisdiction, regardless of the nature or severity of the person's 
handicap.
    (b) Appropriate education. (1) For the purpose of this subpart, the 
provision of an appropriate education is the provision of regular or 
special education and related aids and services that (i) are designed to 
meet individual educational needs of handicapped persons as adequately 
as the needs of nonhandicapped persons are met and (ii) are based upon 
adherence to procedures that satisfy the requirements of Sec. 15b.23, 
Sec. 15b.24, and Sec. 15b.25.
    (2) Implementation of an individualized education program developed 
in accordance with the Education of the Handicapped Act is one means of 
meeting the standard established in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
    (3) A recipient may place a handicapped person in or refer such 
person to a program other than the one that it operates as its means of 
carrying out the requirements of this subpart. If so, the recipient 
remains responsible for ensuring that the requirements of this subpart 
are met with respect to any

[[Page 401]]

handicapped person so placed or referred.
    (c) Free education--(1) General. For the purpose of this section, 
the provision of a free education is the provision of educational and 
related services without cost to handicapped persons or their parents or 
guardians, except for those fees that are imposed on nonhandicapped 
persons or their parents or guardians. It may consist either of the 
provision of free services or, if a recipient places a handicapped 
person in or refers such person to a program not operated by the 
recipient as its means of carrying out the requirements of this subpart, 
payment for the costs of the program. Funds available from any public or 
private agency may be used to meet the requirements of this subpart. 
Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve an insurer or 
similar third party from an otherwise valid obligation to provide or pay 
for services provided to a handicapped person.
    (2) Transportation. If a recipient places a handicapped person in or 
refers such person to a program not operated by the recipient as its 
means of carrying out the requirements of this subpart, the recipient 
shall ensure that adequate transportation to and from the program is 
provided at no greater cost than would be incurred by the person or his 
or her parents or guardian if the person were placed in the program 
operated by the recipient.
    (3) Residential placement. If placement in a public or private 
residential program is necessary to provide a free appropriate public 
education to a handicapped person because of their handicap, the 
program, including nonmedical care and room and board, shall be provided 
at no cost to the person or his or her parents or guardian.
    (4) Placement of handicapped persons by parents. If a recipient has 
made available in conformance with the requirements of this section and 
Sec. 15b.23, a free appropriate public education to a handicapped person 
and the person's parents or guardian choose to place the person in a 
private school, the recipient is not required to pay for the person's 
education in the private school. Disagreements between a parent or 
guardian and a recipient regarding whether the recipient has made such a 
program available or otherwise regarding the question of financial 
responsibility are subject to the due process procedures of Sec. 15b.25.
    (d) Compliance. A recipient may not exclude any qualified 
handicapped person from a public elementary or secondary education after 
the effective date of this regulation. A recipient that is not, on the 
effective date of this regulation, in full compliance with the other 
requirements of the preceding paragraphs of this section shall meet such 
requirements at the earliest practicable time but in no event later than 
September 1, 1982.


<R05>
Sec. 15b.23  Educational setting.

    (a) Academic setting. A recipient to which this subpart applies 
shall educate, or shall provide for the education of each qualified 
handicapped person in its jurisdiction with persons who are not 
handicapped to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of the 
handicapped person. A recipient shall place a handicapped person in the 
regular educational environment operated by the recipient unless it is 
demonstrated by the recipient that the education of the person in the 
regular environment with the use of supplementary aids and services 
cannot be achieved satisfactorily. Whenever a recipient places a person 
in a setting other than the regular educational environment pursuant to 
this paragraph, it shall take into account the proximity of the 
alternate setting to the person's home.
    (b) Nonacademic setting. In providing or arranging for the provision 
of nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities, including 
meals, recess periods, and the services and activities set forth in 
Sec. 15b.26(a)(2), a recipient shall ensure that handicapped persons 
participate with nonhandicapped persons in such activities and services 
to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of the handicapped person 
in question.
    (c) Comparable facilities. If a recipient, in compliance with 
paragraph (a) of this section, operates a facility that is identifiable 
as being for handicapped persons, the recipient shall ensure that the 
facility and the services and activities provided therein are comparable 
to

[[Page 402]]

the other facilities, services, and activities of the recipient.


<R05>
Sec. 15b.24  Evaluation and placement.

    (a) Placement evaluation. A recipient that operates a public 
elementary or secondary education program shall conduct an evaluation in 
accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section of any 
person who, because of handicap, needs or is believed to need special 
education or related services before taking any action with respect to 
the initial placement of the person in a regular or special education 
program and any subsequent significant change in placement.
    (b) Evaluation procedures. A recipient to which this section applies 
shall establish standards and procedures for the evaluation and 
placement of persons who, because of handicap, need or are believed to 
need special education or related services which ensure that:
    (1) Tests and other evaluation materials have been validated for the 
specific purpose for which they are used and are administered by trained 
personnel in conformance with the instructions provided by their 
producer;
    (2) Tests and other evaluation materials include those tailored to 
assess specific areas of educational need and not merely those which are 
designed to provide a single general intelligence quotient; and
    (3) Tests are selected and administered so as best to ensure that, 
when a test is administered to a student with impaired sensory, manual, 
or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the student's 
aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factor the test purports 
to measure, rather than reflecting the student's impaired sensory, 
manual or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors 
that the test purports to measure).
    (c) Placement procedures. In interpreting evaluation data and in 
making placement decisions, a recipient shall (1) draw upon information 
from a variety of sources, including aptitude and achievement tests, 
teacher recommendations, physical conditions, social or cultural 
background, and adaptive behavior, (2) establish procedures to ensure 
that information obtained from all such sources is documented and 
carefully considered, (3) ensure that the placement decision is made by 
a group of persons, including persons knowledgeable about the child, the 
meaning of the evaluation data, and the placement options, and (4) 
ensure that the placement decision is made in conformity with 
Sec. 15b.23.
    (d) Reevaluation. A recipient to which this section applies shall 
establish procedures, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, 
for periodic reevaluation of students who have been provided special 
education and related services. A reevaluation procedure consistent with 
the Education for the Handicapped Act is one means of meeting this 
requirement.


<R05>
Sec. 15b.25  Procedural safeguards.

    A recipient that operates a public elementary or secondary education 
program shall establish and implement, with respect to action regarding 
the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of persons who, 
because of handicap, need or are believed to need special instruction or 
related services, a system of procedural safeguards that includes 
notice, an opportunity for the parents or guardian of the person to 
examine relevant records, an impartial hearing with opportunity for 
participation by the person's parents or guardian and representation by 
counsel, and a review procedure. Compliance with the procedural 
safeguards of section 615 of the Education of the Handicapped Act is one 
means of meeting this requirement.


<R05>
Sec. 15b.26  Nonacademic services.

    (a) General. (1) Recipients to which this subpart applies shall 
provide nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities in such 
a manner as is necessary to afford handicapped students an equal 
opportunity for participation in such services and activities.
    (2) Nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities may 
include counseling services, physical education and athletics, food 
services, transportation, health services, recreational activities, 
special interest groups or

[[Page 403]]

clubs sponsored by the recipient, referrals to agencies which provide 
assistance to handicapped persons, and assistance in obtaining outside 
employment.
    (b) Counseling services. A recipient to which this subpart applies 
that provides personal, academic, or vocational counseling, guidance, or 
placement services to its students shall provide these services without 
discrimination on the basis of handicap. The recipient shall ensure that 
qualified handicapped students are not counseled toward more restrictive 
career objectives than are nonhandicapped students with similar 
interests and abilities.
    (c) Physical education and athletics. (1) In providing physical 
education courses and athletics and similar programs and activities to 
any of its students, a recipient to which this subpart applies may not 
discriminate on the basis of handicap. A recipient that offers physical 
education courses or that operates or sponsors interscholastic, club, or 
intramural athletics shall provide to qualified handicapped students an 
equal opportunity for participation in these activities.
    (2) A recipient may offer handicapped students physical education 
and athletic activities that are separate or different from those 
offered to nonhandicapped students only if separation or differentiation 
is consistent with requirements of Sec. 15b.23, and only if no qualified 
handicapped student is denied the opportunity to compete for teams or to 
participate in courses that are not separate or different.
    (d) Food services. In providing food services to any of its 
students, a recipient to which this subpart applies may not discriminate 
on the basis of handicap. (1) Recipients shall serve special meals, at 
no extra charge, to students whose handicap restricts their diet. 
Recipients may require students to provide medical certification that 
special meals are needed because of their handicap.
    (2) Where existing food service facilities are not completely 
accessible and usable, recipients may provide aides or use other equally 
effective methods to serve food to handicapped persons. Recipients shall 
provide all food services in the most intergrated setting appropriate to 
the needs of handicapped persons as required by Sec. 15b.23(b).


<R05>
Sec. 15b.27  Extension education.

    (a) General. A recipient to which this subpart applies that operates 
an extension education program or activity receiving assistance from 
this Department may not, on the basis of handicap, exclude qualified 
handicapped persons from the program or activity. A recipient shall take 
into account the needs of such persons in determining the benefits or 
services to be provided under the program or activity.
    (b) Program delivery sites. (1) Where existing extension office 
facilities are inaccessible, recipients may make program services 
normally provided at those sites available to qualified handicapped 
persons through other methods which are equally effective. These methods 
may include meetings in accessible locations, home visits, written or 
telephonic communications, and other equally effective alternatives.
    (2) For program services delivered at other publicly-owned 
facilities, recipients shall select accessible facilities wherever 
possible. If accessible facilities cannot be selected because they are 
unavailable or infeasible due to the nature of the activity, recipients 
shall use other methods to deliver program benefits to qualified 
handicapped persons. These methods may include the redesign of 
activities or some sessions of activities, the provision of aides, home 
visits, or other equally effective alternatives.
    (3) For program services delivered at privately-owned facilities, 
such as homes and farm buildings, recipients shall use accessible 
facilities whenever qualified handicapped persons requiring such 
accessibility are participating, have expressed an interest in 
participating, or are likely to participate. If accessible facilities 
cannot be selected because they are unavailable or infeasible due to the 
nature of the activity, recipients shall use other methods to deliver 
program benefits to qualified handicapped persons. These methods may 
include the redesign of activities or some sessions of activities, the 
provision of aides, home visits, or other equally effective 
alternatives.

[[Page 404]]

    (4) Recipients shall make camping activities accessible to qualified 
handicapped persons. Recipients are not required to make every existing 
camp, all existing camp facilities, or all camp sessions accessible, but 
recipients who operate more than one camp or session may not limit 
qualified handicapped persons to one camp or session.
    (c) Program materials. Recipients shall make program materials 
accessible to qualified handicapped persons with sensory or mental 
impairments. Commonly-used materials shall be readily available in 
alternate forms such as Braille or tape. Upon request, recipients shall 
make other materials available through appropriate means such as 
Braille, tape, readers, large print formats, simplified versions, 
written scripts, or interpreters. Recipients need not provide 
individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or 
other devices or services of a personal nature.


<R05>
Sec. 15b.28  Private education programs.

    (a) A recipient that operates a private elementary or secondary 
education program receiving assistance from this Department may not, on 
the basis of handicap, exclude a qualified handicapped person from such 
program if the person can, with minor adjustments, be provided an 
appropriate education, as defined by Sec. 15b.22(b)(1)(i). Each 
recipient to which this section applies is also subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 15b.23 and Sec. 15b.26.
    (b) A recipient to which this section applies may not charge more 
for the provision of an appropriate education to handicapped persons 
than to nonhandicapped persons except to the extent that any additional 
charge is justified by a substantial increase in cost to the recipient.


<R04>
                   Subpart E--Postsecondary Education


<R05>
Sec. 15b.29  Applicability.

    Subpart E applies to public and private postsecondary education 
programs and activities, including postsecondary vocational education 
programs and activities, that receive Federal financial assistance 
provided by the Department of Agriculture after the effective date of 
this part.

[47 FR 25470, June 11, 1982, as amended at 55 FR 52139, Dec. 19, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 15b.30  Admissions and recruitment.

    (a) General. Qualified handicapped persons may not, on the basis of 
handicap, be denied admission or be subjected to discrimination in 
admission or recruitment by a recipient to which this subpart applies.
    (b) Admissions. In administering its admission policies, a recipient 
to which this subpart applies:
    (1) May not apply limitations upon the number or proportion of 
handicapped persons who may be admitted;
    (2) May not make use of any test or criterion for admission that has 
a disproportionate, adverse effect on handicapped persons or any class 
of handicapped persons unless (i) the test or criterion, as used by the 
recipient, has been validated as a predictor of success in the education 
program or activity in question and (ii) alternate tests or criteria 
that have a less disproportionate, adverse effect are not shown by the 
Secretary to be available.
    (3) Shall assure itself that (i) admissions tests are selected and 
administered so as best to ensure that, when a test is administered to 
an applicant who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or 
speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the applicant's 
aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factor the test purports 
to measure, rather than reflecting the applicant's impaired sensory, 
manual, or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors 
that the test purports to measure); (ii) admissions tests that are 
designed for persons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills 
are offered as often and in as timely a manner as are other admissions 
tests; and (iii) admissions tests are administered in facilities that, 
on the whole, are accessible to handicapped persons; and
    (4) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, may not 
make preadmission inquiry as to whether an applicant for admission is a 
handicapped person but, after admission, may take inquiries on a 
confidential

[[Page 405]]

basis as to handicaps that may require accommodation.
    (c) Preadmission inquiry exception. When a recipient is taking 
remedial action to correct the effects of past discrimination pursuant 
to Sec. 15b.8(a) or when a recipient is taking voluntary action to 
overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited 
participation in its federally assisted program or activity pursuant to 
Sec. 15b.8(b), the recipient may invite applicants for admissions to 
indicate whether and to what extent they are handicapped: Provided, That 
(1) the recipient states clearly on any written questionnaire used for 
this purpose or makes clear orally if no written questionnaire is used 
that the information requested is intended for use solely in connection 
with its remedial action obligations or its voluntary action efforts; 
and (2) the recipient states clearly that the information is being 
requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential, that 
refusal to provide it will not subject the applicant to any adverse 
treatment, and that it will be used only in accordance with this part.
    (d) Validity studies. For the purpose of paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, a recipient may base prediction equations on first year grades, 
but shall conduct periodic validity studies against the criterion of 
overall success in the education program or activity in question in 
order to monitor the general validity of the test scores.


<R05>
Sec. 15b.31  Treatment of students.

    (a) General. No qualified handicapped student shall, on the basis of 
handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, 
or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any academic, 
research, occupational training, housing, health, insurance, counseling, 
financial aid, physical education, athletics, recreation, 
transportation, other extracurricular, other postsecondary education 
program or activity to which this subpart applies.
    (b) A recipient to which this subpart applies that considers 
participation by students in education programs or activities not 
operated wholly by the recipient as part of, or equivalent to, an 
education program or activity operated by the recipient shall assure 
itself that the other education program or activity, as a whole, 
provides an equal opportunity for the participation of qualified 
handicapped persons.
    (c) A recipient to which this subpart applies may not, on the basis 
of handicap, exclude any qualified handicapped student from any course, 
course of study, or other part of its education program or activity.
    (d) A recipient to which this subpart applies shall operate its 
programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 15b.32  Academic adjustments.

    (a) Academic requirements. A recipient to which this subpart applies 
shall make such modifications to its academic requirements as are 
necessary to ensure that such requirements do not discriminate or have 
the effect of discriminating on the basis of handicap, against a 
qualified handicapped applicant or student. Academic requirements that 
the recipient can demonstrate are essential to the program or 
instruction being pursued by such student or to any directly related 
licensing requirement will not be regarded as discriminatory within the 
meaning of this section. Modifications may include changes in the length 
of time permitted for the completion of degree requirements, 
substitution of specific courses required for the completion of degree 
requirements, and adaptation of the manner in which specific courses are 
conducted.
    (b) Other rules. A recipient to which this subpart applies may not 
impose upon handicapped students other rules, such as the prohibition of 
tape recorders in classrooms or of dog guides in campus buildings, that 
have the effect of limiting the participation of handicapped students in 
the recipient's education program or activity.
    (c) Course examinations. In its course examinations or other 
procedures for evaluating students' academic achievement in its program, 
a recipient to which this subpart applies shall provide such methods for 
evaluating the achievement of students who have a handicap that impairs 
sensory, manual, or speaking skills as will best ensure that the results 
of the evaluation represent the students' achievements

[[Page 406]]

in the course, rather than reflecting the students' impaired sensory, 
manual, or speaking skills (except where such skills are the factors 
that the test purports to measure).
    (d) Auxiliary aids. (1) A recipient to which this subpart applies 
shall take such steps as are necessary to ensure that no handicapped 
student is denied the benefits of, excluded from participation in, or 
otherwise subjected to discrimination under the education program or 
activity operated by the recipient because of the absence of educational 
auxiliary aids for students with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking 
skills.
    (2) Auxiliary aids may include taped texts, interpreters or other 
effective methods of making orally delivered materials available to 
students with hearing impairments, readers in libraries for students 
with visual impairments, classroom equipment adapted for use by students 
with manual impairments, and other similar services and actions. 
Recipients need not provide attendants, individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices or services of a 
personal nature.


<R05>
Sec. 15b.33  Housing.

    (a) Housing provided by the recipient. A recipient that provides 
housing to its nonhandicapped students shall provide comparable, 
convenient, and accessible housing to handicapped students at the same 
cost as to others. At the end of the transition period provided for in 
subpart C, such housing shall be available in sufficient quantity and 
variety so that the scope of handicapped students' choice of living

791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 
29 CFR part 1614, shall apply to employment in federally conducted 
programs or activities.


<R05>
Secs. 15e.141--15e.148  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 15e.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 15e.150, no qualified 
individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 15e.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph 
does not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;
    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant historic features of an historic property; or
    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 15e.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources

[[Page 417]]

available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program 
or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the 
reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such 
an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action 
that result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless 
ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services 
of the program or activity.
    (b) Methods.--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any 
other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is 
not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where 
other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. 
The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet 
accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any 
regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for 
meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority 
to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified 
individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 15e.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give 
priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with 
handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property 
is not required because of Sec. 15e.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative 
methods of achieving program accessibility include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or 
through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by January 24, 1994, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by November 26, 1996, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by May 26, 1994, a transition plan setting forth 
the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide 
an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with 
handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with handicaps;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 15e.151  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements,

[[Page 418]]

and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), 
as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings 
covered by this section.


<R05>
Secs. 15e.152--15e.159  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 15e.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate 
with persons with impaired hearing.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 15e.160 would result 
in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result 
in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or 
her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in 
the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must 
be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would 
result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any 
other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens 
but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, 
individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the 
program or activity.

    (b) The agency shall process complaints alleging violations of 
section 504 with respect to employment according to the procedures 
established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR 
part 1614 pursuant to section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29

Clerk in the USDA OCR.
    (a) Do I have to file a ``Section 741 Complaint Request'' if USDA is 
already working on my complaint? Do I have to file again? If USDA OCR 
already reviewed or is working on your complaint, you will receive a 
notice by March 1, 1999, indicating that your complaint automatically 
has been docketed as a Section 741 Complaint Request for consideration 
under these procedures. The notice will provide you with the docket 
number assigned your Request and will give you further instructions with 
respect to what options you have or what actions you must take.
    (b) What if USDA is not working on my complaint? If I think USDA has 
reviewed or is working on my complaint, but do not receive a letter by

Request with the Docketing Clerk at USDA OCR.
    (c) How long do I have to file my Section 741 Complaint Request? You 
have

[[Page 422]]

you consider necessary to prove that your complaint is an eligible 
complaint suitable for consideration under these procedures.

Request should also include an authorization signed by you indicating 
that the attorney is entitled to represent you on your behalf. If USDA

authorization, all documents in connection with consideration of your 
complaint under these procedures will be sent to your attorney and not 
to you.


<R04>
    Subpart C--What Happens After I Send In My Section 741 Complaint 
    Request? May I Seek to Resolve My Complaint Informally With OCR?


<R05>
Sec. 15f.8  What does the Docketing Clerk do with my Section 741 Complaint Request?

    All Section 741 Complaint Requests docketed by the OCR Docketing 
Clerk will be referred to the Director for an informal review. The 
Director will determine if the complaint is one that can be resolved 
informally, and, if so, the Director will seek to resolve the complaint 
informally with the complainant.


<R05>
Sec. 15f.9  What will the Director do to settle my Section 741 Complaint Request when it is received?

    The Director will review each Section 741 Complaint Request. If the 
Director finds that your complaint is an eligible complaint, the 
Director will: review all documents and evidence submitted by you; 
review all agency or OCR files, if any exist, regarding the 
circumstances surrounding the alleged discrimination; review any damage 
claims; and seek any further clarification, if necessary, from either 
you or the agency. OCR also may refer your eligible complaint for a 
formal investigation by the OCR, Program Investigation Division or by an 
outside contractor. Based on his or her review, the Director will either 
undertake negotiations with you to resolve the complaint; or inform you 
that OCR will not settle the complaint and explain to you your options, 
including your right to pursue formal proceedings before an ALJ under 
subpart D. If the complaint is successfully resolved or settled, the 
Director will issue a final determination disposing of the matter.

[[Page 423]]


<R05>
Sec. 15f.10  What if I do not want the Director to review my Section 741 Complaint Request and I want to proceed directly to a hearing?

    If you do not want the Director to review your Section 741 Complaint 
Request, you may request a hearing following the procedures below in 
subpart D. You may request a hearing at any time during informal review 
or negotiations with the Director, or at any time during USDA 
consideration of your Section 741 Complaint Request.


<R04>
   Subpart D--If I Request A Hearing, What Will Happen? How Will The 
                          Hearing Be Conducted?


<R05>
Sec. 15f.11  Where must I file a hearing request and what happens to it?

    If you desire a hearing, you must file a request for a hearing with 
the Docketing Clerk, citing the docket number assigned to your Section 
741 Complaint Request. When the Docketing Clerk receives your request 
for a hearing, your Section 741 Complaint Request will be assigned to an 
ALJ. The Docketing Clerk will send a notice of your hearing request to 
OCR and the agency, notifying them of the docket number and the assigned 
ALJ. The Docketing Clerk also will send you a notice of receipt of the 
hearing request that will inform you of the name of the assigned ALJ.


<R05>
Sec. 15f.12  Am I entitled to a hearing in all circumstances?

    Under section 741, you have a right to a hearing as part of the 
process for USDA to render a final determination on your eligible 
complaint. However, if at any time the ALJ determines that your 
complaint is not an eligible complaint, he or she may dismiss your 
complaint with a final determination and USDA review of your complaint 
will then have been completed. You also are not entitled to a hearing if 
there are no material issues of fact in dispute between you and USDA. In 
other words, if the only dispute remaining is a question of law, you 
will not receive a hearing and the ALJ will make a final determination 
under Sec. 15f.16.


<R05>
Sec. 15f.13  What is the function of the ALJ and who may communicate with him?

    (a) What are the powers of the ALJ? The ALJ is responsible for 
conducting a hearing at your request on your Section 741 Complaint 
Request. He or she will have all powers prescribed in these rules and 
will make a proposed determination on your complaint. The proposed 
determination then will become the final determination after 35 days, 
unless the ASA reviews the proposed determination.
    (b) What is an ex parte communication? An ex parte communication is 
a communication by one party to a proceeding with the ALJ outside of the 
presence of, or without notice to, the other parties to a proceeding. Ex 
parte communications in the proceedings on your complaint are prohibited 
and will be handled as follows:
    (1) The ALJ will not engage in ex parte communications regarding the 
merits of a complaint with any party or with any person having any 
interest in the proceedings on the complaint, including OCR and any 
person in an advocacy or investigative capacity, at any time between the 
assignment of a hearing to him or her and the issuance of a proposed 
determination. This prohibition does not apply to:
    (i) Discussions of procedural matters related to the complaint; or
    (ii) Discussions of the merits of the complaint where all parties to 
the proceeding on the complaint have been given notice and an 
opportunity to participate.
    (2) In the case of a communication described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) 
of this section, a memorandum of any such discussion shall be included 
in the hearing record.
    (3) No party to the proceeding or other interested person shall make 
or knowingly cause to be made to the ALJ an ex parte communication 
relevant to the merits of the complaint.
    (4) If the ALJ receives an ex parte communication in violation of 
this section, the ALJ will place in the written record:
    (i) All such written communications;
    (ii) Memoranda stating the substance of all such oral 
communications; and

[[Page 424]]

    (iii) All written responses to such communications, and memoranda 
stating the substance of any oral responses to such communications.
    (c) Upon receipt of a communication knowingly made or knowingly 
caused to be made by a party in violation of this section the ALJ may, 
to the extent consistent with the interests of justice and the policy 
underlying these proceedings, require the party or other interested 
person making the communication to show cause why such party's claim or 
interest in the complaint should not be dismissed, denied, disregarded, 
or otherwise adversely affected on account of such violation.


<R05>
Sec. 15f.14  What happens after I file a request for a hearing?

    Within 20 days after you have filed your request for a hearing, ALJ 
shall file with the Docketing Clerk a notice stating the time, place, 
and manner of the hearing. The ALJ will have due regard for the public 
interest and the convenience and necessity of the parties in determining 
the time, place, and manner of the hearing. The notice will state 
whether the hearing will be conducted by telephone, audiovisual 
telecommunication, or personal attendance of any individual expected to 
participate in the hearing. The Docketing Clerk will send copies of the 
notice to the complainant and to all other parties to the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 15f.15  What happens after the Docketing Clerk notifies all parties?

    The first step in this process involves a response to your hearing 
request by OCR. OCR will turn over its entire file on your complaint to 
the ALJ. OCR also will file a report with the ALJ stating its position 
with respect to whether or not your complaint is an eligible complaint, 
with reasons for its position, as well as stating its position with 
respect to the merits of your complaint. OCR must turn over its file and 
make its report on its position on your complaint within 35 days. OCR 
must provide a copy to you of anything it provides to the ALJ.


<R05>
Sec. 15f.16  Although I request a hearing, may I request the ALJ to issue a decision without a hearing?

    (a) At any time after the parties have been notified of your hearing 
request, you may file a request with the ALJ to make a determination 
based on the written record. With your request, you should file any 
other arguments or evidence that you wish the ALJ to consider. The 
agency and OCR will have 35 days after you file your request to file any 
additional information, arguments, or evidence for the consideration of 
the ALJ. The ALJ may recommend dismissal of your complaint on the basis 
of a finding that it is not an eligible complaint; recommend denial of 
your eligible complaint on the merits; or make a proposed finding of 
discrimination on your eligible complaint and recommend to award you 
such relief as would be afforded under the applicable statute or 
regulation under which the eligible complaint was filed. The ALJ will 
make a proposed determination on your complaint based on the original 
complaint, the Section 741 Complaint Request, the OCR report, and any 
other evidence or written documents filed by the parties. The proposed 
determination will become the final determination 35 days after it is 
filed unless you request review of the proposed determination by the 
ASA. The ASA also may review the proposed determination on his or her 
own initiative. If the ASA reviews the decision, he or she will allow 
the parties a reasonable opportunity to file briefs in support of or 
opposition to the proposed determination, and afterwards will issue a 
final determination within 35 days after you request review of the 
proposed determination.
    (b) To the maximum extent practicable, a final determination will be 
made within 180 days of your filing of the Section 741 Complaint 
Request.


<R05>
Sec. 15f.17  What happens before the hearing?

    (a) Do I need to file another answer or pre-hearing brief? You may 
file a pre-hearing brief in support of your complaint.

[[Page 425]]

    (b) Will there be a pre-hearing conference? The ALJ may hold a pre-
hearing conference. If such a conference is to be held, the notice of 
the pre-hearing conference also will contain a notice to the parties of 
a time and date for the pre-hearing conference. Pre-hearing conferences 
normally will be held by telephone. Issues that may be addressed at the 
pre-hearing conference may include: simplification of the issues; the 
possibility of obtaining stipulations of fact and of the authenticity of 
documents; limitation of the number of witnesses; exchange of copies of 
hearing exhibits; negotiation, compromise or settlement of issues; 
identification of documents of which official notice will be requested; 
a schedule for completion of the actions decided upon at the conference; 
and any other matters that may aid and expedite the conclusion of the 
proceeding. No transcript of the pre-hearing conference will be made but 
the ALJ will issue a written memorandum summarizing the results of the 
pre-hearing conference.
    (c) What else may the ALJ ask for before the hearing? Prior to the 
hearing, the ALJ may require each of the parties to furnish any or all 
of the following: an outline of a party's position with respect to the 
complaint, the facts upon which the party intends to rely, the legal 
theories upon which the party intends to rely, copies of or a list of 
the documents and exhibits which the party anticipates on introducing at 
the hearing, and a list of anticipated witnesses.


<R05>
Sec. 15f.18  May I depose potential witnesses?

    (a) A party may request an order from the ALJ to take the testimony 
of any person by deposition upon oral examination or written 
interrogatories before any officer authorized to administer oaths at the 
place of examination, for use as evidence. The application for the order 
must specify the reason and need for taking testimony by deposition.
    (b) The time, place, and manner of taking depositions will be as 
mutually agreed by the parties, or failing agreement, by order of the 
ALJ.
    (c) No testimony taken by depositions will be considered as part of 
the evidence in the hearing until such testimony is offered and received 
in evidence at the hearing, and ordinarily it will not be received into 
evidence if the deponent is present and can testify at the hearing. 
However, when the deponent is present and can testify, the deposition 
may be used to contradict or impeach the testimony of the deponent given 
at the hearing. Where you have requested a final determination by the 
ALJ based on the written record without a hearing, the ALJ, in his or 
her discretion, may receive depositions to supplement the record.
    (d) Each party will bear its own expenses associated with the taking 
of any deposition.


<R05>
Sec. 15f.19  Other than myself, OCR, and the agency, may any other interested party participate in the proceeding?

    In most cases, there will be no parties to a proceeding under these 
rules, other than the complainant, OCR, and, and if it so desires, the 
agency. However, if there are circumstances in which additional parties 
have an interest in the proceeding, such as a bank which participated in 
a case involving a guaranteed loan, such other interested parties may be 
permitted to participate in the proceeding at the discretion of the ALJ.


<R05>
Sec. 15f.20  May I subpoena witnesses to the hearings?

    No. USDA has no statutory authority to subpoena witnesses to testify 
at the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 15f.21  What rules are applicable to the actual conduct of the hearing?

    (a) Who may appear at the hearing? You may appear at the hearing in 
person or through your attorney. OCR or the agency will appear through a 
designated representative, which may include a USDA attorney. Any person 
who appears as counsel must conform to the standards of ethical conduct 
required of practitioners before the courts of the United States.
    (b) What happens if I fail to show up? If, after having received 
notice of the

[[Page 426]]

hearing under Sec. 15f.14, you fail to appear at the hearing without 
good cause, you will have waived your right to a hearing in the 
proceeding and the ALJ may proceed to issue a final determination based 
on the written record as provided for under Sec. 15f.16.
    (c) Which party presents its case first at the hearing? You, as the 
complainant, will proceed first at the proceeding, unless otherwise 
determined by the ALJ.
    (d) What kind of evidence will be admitted and how will it be 
handled? (1) In general. The hearing will be conducted by the ALJ in the 
manner he or she determines most likely to obtain the facts relevant to 
the matter or matters at issue. The ALJ may confine the presentation of 
facts and evidence to pertinent matters and exclude irrelevant, 
immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence, information, or questions. 
Each party will have the opportunity to present oral and documentary 
evidence, oral testimony of witnesses, and arguments in support of the 
party's position; controvert evidence relied on by any other party; and 
question all witnesses. The testimony of witnesses at a hearing will be 
on oath or affirmation and will be subject to cross-examination. Any 
evidence may be received by the ALJ without regard to whether that 
evidence could be admitted in judicial proceedings. Upon a finding of 
good cause, the ALJ may order that any witness be examined separately 
and apart from all other witnesses except those who may be parties to 
the proceeding.
    (2) Objections. (i) If a party objects to the admission of any 
evidence or to the limitation of the scope of any examination or cross-
examination or to any other ruling of the ALJ, the party must state 
briefly the grounds of such objection.
    (ii) Only objections made before the ALJ may subsequently be relied 
upon in the proceeding.
    (3) Depositions. The deposition of any witness will be admitted in 
the manner provided in and subject to the provisions of Sec. 15f.18(c) 
of these rules.
    (4) Exhibits. Unless the ALJ finds that the furnishing of copies is 
impracticable, two copies of each exhibit must be filed with the ALJ. A 
party submitting an exhibit must provide every other party (except 
interested parties) a copy of the exhibit one week before the hearing. A 
true copy of an exhibit may be substituted for the original.
    (5) Official records or documents. An official government record or 
document or entry therein, if admissible for any purpose, will be 
admissible in evidence without the production of the person who made or 
prepared the same, and will be prima facie evidence of the relevant 
facts stated therein. Such record or document must be evidenced by an 
official publication thereof or a copy certified by a person having 
legal authority to make such certification.
    (6) Official notice. Official notice will be taken of such matters 
as are judicially noted by the courts of the United States and of any 
other matter of technical, scientific, or commercial fact of established 
character if the parties are given adequate notice of matters so 
noticed, and the parties will be given adequate opportunity to show that 
such facts are erroneously noticed.
    (7) Offer of proof. Whenever evidence is excluded by the ALJ, the 
party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which must be 
included in the transcript. The offer of proof should consist of a brief 
statement describing the evidence excluded. If the evidence consists of 
a brief oral statement, it must be included in the transcript in its 
entirety. If the evidence consists of an exhibit, it must be marked for 
identification and inserted in the hearing record.
    (8) Interlocutory review. Interlocutory review of rulings by the ALJ 
will not be permitted.
    (9) Transcript or recording. (i) Hearings to be conducted by 
telephone will be recorded verbatim by electronic recording device. 
Hearings conducted by audio-visual telecommunication or by the personal 
attendance of parties and witnesses must be transcribed, unless the ALJ 
finds that recording the hearing verbatim would expedite the proceeding 
and the ALJ orders the hearing to be recorded verbatim. The ALJ must 
certify that to the best of his or her knowledge and belief any 
recording made pursuant to this paragraph with exhibits that were 
accepted into evidence is the record of the hearing.

[[Page 427]]

    (ii) If a hearing is recorded verbatim, a party requests the 
transcript of a hearing or part of a hearing, and the ALJ determines 
that the disposition of the proceeding would be expedited by a 
transcript of the hearing or part of a hearing, the ALJ shall order the 
verbatim transcription of the recording as requested by the party.
    (iii) The costs of transcription or verbatim recordings will be paid 
for by USDA and charged to the agency whose action gave rise to the 
complaint at issue. Copies of recordings or transcripts of hearings will 
be made available to any party at the actual cost of duplication.


<R05>
Sec. 15f.22  What happens after the hearing?

    The ALJ will fix a reasonable time for filing posthearing briefs, 
proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and if permitted, 
reply briefs. Briefs should include a summary of evidence relied upon 
together with references to exhibit numbers and citations to the 
transcript and authorities relied upon. Briefs must be filed with the 
Docketing Clerk with copies to all parties.


<R05>
Sec. 15f.23  What will constitute the record for the final determination?

    The original complaint, the Section 741 Complaint Request, the OCR 
report, the agency answer, the transcript of testimony, exhibits, 
affidavits, depositions, briefs, memoranda of law, and all pleadings, 
motions, papers, and requests filed in the proceeding, including 
rulings, and the proposed determination by an ALJ (if applicable) shall 
constitute the exclusive record for the final determination.


<R05>
Sec. 15f.24  When and in what form will a final determination be made on my complaint by USDA?

    (a) The ALJ will make a proposed determination orally at the close 
of a hearing, or in writing within 35 days. The ALJ may recommend 
dismissal of your complaint on the basis of a finding that it is not an 
eligible complaint; recommend denial of your eligible complaint on the 
merits; or make a proposed finding of discrimination on your eligible 
complaint and recommend to award you such relief as would be afforded 
under the applicable statute or regulation under which the eligible 
complaint was filed. The proposed determination will become the final 
determination 35 days after it is made, unless you request review of the 
proposed determination by the ASA. The ASA also may review the proposed 
determination on his or her own initiative. If the ASA reviews the 
proposed determination, he or she will allow the parties a reasonable 
opportunity to file briefs in support or opposition to the proposed 
determination, and afterwards file a final determination within 35 days 
after you request review of the proposed determination.
    (b) To the maximum extent practicable, a final determination will be 
filed within 180 days after you filed your Section 741 Complaint 
Request.


<R05>
Sec. 15f.25  Will USDA pay my attorneys fees if I win?

    If you prevail on your eligible complaint, either in whole or in 
part, after a proceeding before an ALJ under the procedures in this 
subpart, you may be eligible for an award of attorneys fees as a 
prevailing party under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), 5 U.S.C. 
504. To get an EAJA award, you must file an application for such fees 
with the ALJ within 30 days after the final determination is made. 
Instructions for filing an EAJA application and obtaining an EAJA award 
are contained in 7 CFR part 1, subpart J. The ALJ must follow those 
rules, and not these Section 741 Complaint Request rules, in making any 
EAJA award.


<R04>
 Subpart E--What If I Do Not Agree With The Final Determination by USDA?


<R05>
Sec. 15f.26  May I seek judicial review of the final determination?

    Section 741 provides that you have at least 180 days after a final 
determination denying your eligible complaint under these rules to seek 
judicial review in the United States Court of Federal Claims or a United 
States District Court of competent jurisdiction.

[[Page 428]]


<R04>
   Subpart F--How Do I Count Days For Purposes Of Deadlines and What 
              Happens If I Miss A Deadline In These Rules?


<R05>
Sec. 15f.27  When is something considered ``filed'' as required by these rules and to whom do I need to give copies of what I file?

    A document, or other item, that must be ``filed'' under these rules 
is considered filed when postmarked or when it is received and date-
stamped by the Docketing Clerk.


<R05>
Sec. 15f.28  When I or someone else has to do something within a certain number of days, how will USDA or the ALJ count the days?

    Unless otherwise specifically noted, a ``day'' refers to a calendar 
day and a document that must be filed by a certain date must either be 
postmarked on that date or received by the Docketing Clerk on that date. 
For documents that must be or are ``filed'' under these regulations, you 
count the number of days after filing starting with the day after the 
filing date as day one. For other time periods, you calculate the time 
period by counting the day after receipt by the party as day one. If the 
last day of a time period expires on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a Federal 
holiday, the last day of the time period will expire on the next 
business day.


<R05>
Sec. 15f.29  May I request an extension of a deadline or may I get relief for missing a deadline in these rules?

    You may request that the ALJ extend a deadline in these rules, or 
afford you relief for missing a deadline, which he or she may do, 
consistent with the principles of sovereign immunity, the terms of any 
applicable statute, these rules, and the necessity of expeditious 
completion of the public business. It is the intent of USDA that the 
time deadlines expressed in these regulations be construed equitably to 
ensure resolution of eligible complaints, to the extent permitted by 
law.

acceptance of the nomination, the person has not engaged in, and will 
not engage in, supplying commodities under any title of the Act or the 
Food for Progress Act of 1985 or furnishing ocean transportation or 
ocean transportation-related services for commodities provided under any

Deputy Administrator, Export Credits, FAS.
    (2) USDA's acceptance of such nomination shall remain in effect for 
the period of time requested by the participant or such shorter period 
as the Deputy Administrator, Export Credits, FAS, may determine. USDA 
will withdraw such acceptance if the agent of the participant or 
importer, or any of the affiliates of such agent, violates the 
certifications or undertakings made pursuant to paragraphs (c) (7) and 
(8) of this section.
    (3) A person is required to submit the information and documentation 
required by Sec. 17.4(c) to support the person's first nomination to act 
as an agent of any participant or importer for each fiscal year. For 
subsequent nominations covering the same fiscal year, the person must 
provide a written certification that the information and documentation 
provided earlier are still accurate and complete, or must provide the 
details of any changes to previously submitted information.
    (e) Notification. The Deputy Administrator, Export Credits, FAS, 
shall promptly notify persons nominated as agents of the participant or 
importer, of the determination or of the need for further inquiry, and 
shall provide a written response within 30 calendar days of receipt of 
all the required documents. If USDA will not accept the nomination, the 
notification shall state the reasons therefor. The determination of the 
Deputy Administrator, Export Credits, FAS, is effective immediately and 
continues in effect pending the result of any appeal to the General 
Sales Manager.
    (f) Non-acceptance or withdrawal. (1) If USDA does not accept the 
nomination of a person, or if acceptance has been withdrawn pursuant to 
the provisions of this section, the person may, within 30 calendar days, 
present to the General Sales Manager, orally or in writing, any reasons 
as to why such action

[[Page 434]]

should not stand. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as to 
prohibit a person whose nomination has not been accepted or whose 
acceptance has been withdrawn by USDA from being nominated at a later 
time.
    (2) If, in the procurement of commodities made available under title 
I, Pub. L. 480, a participant or importer uses an agent whose nomination 
has not been accepted in writing by the Deputy Administrator, Export 
Credits, FAS, USDA may withhold sales approval.
    (3) If, in the shipping of commodities made available under title I, 
Pub. L. 480, a participant or importer uses an agent whose nomination 
has not been accepted in writing by the Deputy Administrator, Export 
Credits, FAS, USDA may withhold vessel approval or may deduct from the 
ocean freight differential to be paid, the amount of any commission to 
the agent in connection with the shipment.
    (g) No competitive advantage. A shipping agent may not take any 
action which would give a competitive advantage to any supplier of 
commodities or ocean transportation. This includes, but is not limited 
to, providing advance notice of IFB's or amendments, or selectively 
enforcing IFB or contract requirements.

<R05>
Sec. 17.5  Contracts between commodity suppliers and importers.

    (a) Commodity suppliers and selling agents. (1) Commodity suppliers 
must be determined to be eligible under the Pub. L. 480, title I program 
in order for their contracts to be eligible for CCC financing. A 
prospective commodity supplier must be engaged in the business of 
selling agricultural commodities for export from the United States. The 
commodity supplier must maintain a bona fide business office in the 
United States, and must have a person, principal or agent on whom 
service of judicial process may be had in the United States.
    (2) Persons who wish to participate as commodity suppliers shall 
submit the following information to the Foreign Agricultural Service, 
Stop 1033, USDA, 1400 Independence Ave., SW, Washington, DC 20250-1033:
    (i) A current financial statement of the prospective supplier, 
preferably an audited statement, as evidence of financial 
responsibility. Submission of a letter of reference from a bank is also 
encouraged.
    (ii) A statement containing general background information about the 
firm, including the names and titles of the chief executive officers and 
a description of the firm's experience as an exporter of U.S. 
agricultural commodities. Copies of bills of lading supporting this 
statement are also requested.
    (iii) Any other information requested relating to whether the 
prospective supplier is responsible and is able to perform its 
obligations under this part and the purchase authorization.
    (3) If, at the time the commodity supplier reports the sale it is 
determined that an agent employed or engaged by a commodity supplier to 
obtain a contract is not a selling agent as defined in Sec. 17.2, the 
sale will not be eligible for financing.
    (b) Eligibility for financing. To be eligible for financing, 
commodity contracts must comply with the following requirements unless 
otherwise specified in the purchase authorization.
    (1) Commodity contracts between suppliers and importers are 
considered to be conditioned on the approval by USDA of the contract 
price; conformance of the sale to the provisions of the purchase 
authorization; responsiveness of the offer to IFB terms; and compliance 
by the supplier and the selling agent, if any, with paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (2) Importers and suppliers must enter into contracts within the 
contracting period specified in the purchase authorization. The 
contracts must provide for deliveries to the importer in accordance with 
the delivery terms and during the delivery period specified in the 
purchase authorization, or any amendment or modification thereto.
    (3) Contracts for a commodity, under a purchase authorization which 
limits delivery terms to f.o.b. or f.a.s., must be separate and apart 
from the contracts for ocean transportation of the commodity.

[[Page 435]]

    (4) The supplier's sales price may not exceed the prevailing range 
of export market prices as applied to the terms of sale at the time of 
sale, as determined by USDA. The ``time of sale'' is the date and time 
specified in the IFB for receipt of offers; or the date of the contract 
amendment if the amendment affects the sale price, as determined by 
USDA. The contract price may not be on a cost plus a percentage-of-cost 
basis.
    (c) Contracting procedures--(1) Purchasing--general. (i) Importers 
must purchase commodities on the basis of IFB's.
    (ii) The participant shall maintain a record of all offers received 
from suppliers until the expiration of three years after final payment 
under contracts awarded under the purchase authorization. The GSM may 
examine these records or request specific information in connection with 
the offers.
    (2) Invitations for bids. The following conditions shall apply on 
all purchases of commodities on the basis of IFB's:
    (i) The General Sales Manager must approve the terms of the IFB 
before it is issued by the importer.
    (ii) The importer shall issue the IFB in the United States and shall 
open all offers in public in the United States at the time and place 
specified in the IFB.
    (iii) The IFB must permit submission of offers from all suppliers 
who meet the requirements of this subpart.
    (iv) The IFB may not preclude offers for shipment from any United 
States port(s) unless the purchase authorization provides for 
exportation only from certain ports.
    (v) The IFB may not establish minimum quantities to be offered or 
which will be considered.
    (vi) The IFB must stipulate the responsibility for each party for 
payment of any costs not eligible for financing by CCC.
    (vii) The IFB must be in compliance with this part, the purchase 
authorization, and sound commercial standards.
    (3) Contract awards. (i) The importer shall consider only offers 
which are responsive to the IFB and shall make awards either on the 
basis of the lowest commodity price(s) offered or on the basis of lowest 
landed cost. However, when vessels offered under the flag of the 
participant, the importing country or the destination country; or 
vessels controlled by the participant, the importing country or the 
destination country are to be used, the participant must purchase 
commodities for shipment on such vessels only on the basis of the lowest 
commodity price(s) offered. This limitation may, however, be waived by 
the GSM:
    (A) When the lowest commodity price(s) offered are in locations 
where vessels cannot reasonably be made available without a substantial 
increase in freight costs to the participant;
    (B) For small quantities offered at additional loading points (in 
aggregate not more than 15 percent of the total tonnage offered by a 
vessel); or
    (C) Where this limitation would conflict with the purposes of the 
program.
    (ii) For purposes of this section, ``lowest commodity price(s)'' 
means the lowest commodity price(s) offered for loading onto the type of 
vessel (dry bulk carrier, tanker, etc.) to be utilized to carry the 
commodity purchased.
    (iii) For purposes of this section, ``lowest landed cost'' means the 
combination of commodity price and ocean freight rate resulting in the 
lowest total cost to deliver the commodity to the importing country, 
considering the quantity which must be shipped on privately owned U.S.-
flag commercial vessels, as determined by the Director. Lowest landed 
cost may be defined on either a foreign flag or U.S. flag basis. Awards 
may not be made on the lowest landed cost basis unless IFB's are issued 
for commodity and ocean freight so that all commodity and ocean freight 
offers are reviewed simultaneously.
    (iv) Participants are encouraged to purchase commodities on the 
basis of lowest landed cost when U.S. flag vessels are to be used. If 
such commodity purchases are not made on the basis of lowest landed cost 
(U.S. flag), ocean freight differential payments will nonetheless be 
calculated on the rates of U.S. flag vessels which would represent the 
lowest landed cost.
    (v) Announcement of awards shall be made in the United States. The 
importer shall promptly submit to the Director copies of all offers 
received with

[[Page 436]]

a copy of the IFB which was issued. No sale can be approved for 
financing until this information has been received by FAS. The decision 
of the GSM shall be final regarding the responsiveness of offers to IFB 
terms in the awarding of contracts.
    (d) Contract quantity eligible for financing. The quantity eligible 
for financing in the contract between the supplier and the importer may 
not exceed that quantity approved by the Pub. L. 480 Operations 
Division, FAS, including any approved contract tolerance.
    (e) Contract disputes. Contracts between suppliers and importers 
should stipulate the responsibility of each party for payment of any 
costs not eligible for financing by CCC. Questions as to payment of 
ineligible costs should be resolved between the contracting parties.
    (f) Contract provisions. Each contract entered into for financing 
under this part is deemed to include all terms and conditions required 
by the regulations in this part.
    (g) Export Trade Act (Webb-Pomerene Law). A supplier who is a member 
of a Webb-Pomerene association and who enters into contracts with 
importers as a member of such an association shall so indicate in a 
statement on, or attached to, the copy of the supplier's detailed 
invoice referred to in Sec. 17.9(c)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 17.6  Discounts, fees, commissions and payments.

    For purposes of this section, the term ``payment'' means a 
commission, fee or other compensation of any kind. The term ``other 
compensation of any kind'' includes anything given in return for any 
consideration, services, or benefits received or to be received.
    (a) Discounts. If a contract provides for one or more discounts 
(including but not limited to trade or quantity discounts and discounts 
for prompt payment) whether expressed as such or as ``commissions'' to 
the importer, CCC will only pay the invoice amount after the discount 
(supplier's contracted price less all discounts).
    (b) Selling agents. (1) A supplier may not make a payment to a 
selling agent employed or engaged by the supplier to obtain a contract. 
This prohibition applies to any payment to a person who has acted as a 
selling agent to obtain a contract even though the payment may be for 
services performed that are not themselves services to obtain a 
contract.
    (2) A person is deemed to act ``to obtain a contract'' if the person 
acts on behalf of a commodity supplier to:
    (i) Influence a buyer to award a contract to the supplier;
    (ii) Give the supplier a competitive advantage in relation to other 
potential suppliers; or
    (iii) Influence CCC to approve a contract for financing under this 
part.
    (3) CCC will not consider acts which are purely ministerial in 
nature and do not require the exercise of personal influence, judgment, 
or discretion (such as attending bid openings or presenting offers at 
bid openings), or services to implement a contract after it has been 
entered into by the parties (such as handling documentation problems or 
contract disputes), as acts to obtain a contract.
    (c) Other prohibitions. (1) Suppliers of commodities or ocean 
transportation may not:
    (i) Pay a commission to the participant or importer; to any agency, 
including an agency of the government of the importing country or the 
destination country; or to a corporation owned or controlled by the 
participant or the government of the importing country or the 
destination country.
    (ii) Pay a commission to any affiliate of the participant, if the 
participant is a private entity;
    (iii) Make any payment to an agent of the participant or importer, 
in the person's capacity as such agent, other than ocean transportation 
brokerage commissions.
    (iv) Pay an address commission or payment.
    (2) For ocean transportation, in addition to this paragraph, see 
also Sec. 17.8(j).
    (3) When any portion of the ocean freight is financed by CCC, total 
ocean transportation brokerage commissions earned on U.S. and non-U.S.-
flag bookings by all parties arranging vessel fixtures shall not exceed 
2\1/2\ percent of the total freight costs.
    (4) If a payment is made in violation of this section, CCC may 
demand dollar

[[Page 437]]

refund of the entire amount financed by CCC under the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 17.7  Notice of sale procedures.

    (a) Telephonic notice of sale. The supplier shall, immediately upon 
making a firm sale, telephone a notice of sale to Pub L. 480 Operations 
Division, FAS. A sale is considered firm when the supplier has been 
notified by the importer of an award, even though the contract is 
conditioned on approval by FAS (see Sec. 17.5(b)(1).) If the supplier 
fails to furnish a notice of sale within 3 working days after the date 
of sale, CCC has the right to refuse to finance the sale.
    (b) Sale approval. (1) Pub. L. 480 Operations Division will notify 
the supplier by telephone of approval of the notice of sale.
    (2) The supplier will prepare Form FAS-359, ``Declaration of Sale,'' 
and submit it to Pub. L. 480 Operations Division promptly as soon as FAS 
has provided the CCC Registration Number to the supplier. The supplier 
or the supplier's authorized representative must sign the form.
    (3) Each Form FAS-359 shall cover only a single sale contract. If a 
sale is made under two or more purchase authorizations, the supplier 
will prepare separate forms for each purchase authorization.
    (4) If any correction is needed to the Form FAS-359, the supplier 
must immediately notify FAS. If a contract is amended, the supplier 
should present the original Form FAS-359 for payment along with a copy 
of the written USDA approval of the contract amendment.
    (c) Sale disapproval. (1) Pub. L. 480 Operations Division, FAS, will 
notify the supplier by telephone when a sale is disapproved for 
financing. The related contract between the supplier and importer shall, 
for purposes of financing, be considered null and void.
    (2) On receipt of a notice of disapproval, the supplier shall 
promptly notify the importer.
    (d) Contract delivery period. Price approval is limited to exports 
made during the delivery period stated in the notice of sale or any 
contract amendment approved by the Pub. L. 480 Operations Division, FAS. 
If the supplier cannot complete delivery by the terminal delivery date 
of the contract delivery period, the supplier and the participant or 
importer shall submit a notice of contract amendment as provided in 
paragraph (e) of this section. If the supplier fails to comply, 
Sec. 17.10(d) shall apply.
    (e) Contract amendments. (1) The supplier and the participant or 
importer shall each submit a written notice of each contract amendment 
to the Director immediately after the amendment to the contract is made. 
This includes not only any change in the contract delivery period or any 
other terms and conditions of the contract as provided in the 
information given in the original notice of sale or any amendment 
thereto, but also any change in any other terms and conditions of the 
contract.
    (2) The notice of contract amendment must contain the following:
    (i) A request that USDA approve an amendment to the specifically 
identified sale contract between (the participant or importer) and (the 
commodity supplier).
    (ii) A statement of what the amendment consists of (as, extension of 
delivery period through (date)) and a detailed explanation of the 
reasons for the amendment.
    (iii) A statement that the contract amendment has been agreed to by 
both buyer and seller.
    (3) Pub. Law 480 Operations Division, FAS, will notify the supplier 
as to whether the amendment is approved or disapproved.
    (4) The supplier shall furnish a copy of the USDA approval of the 
amendment with other documentation submitted to obtain payment.
    (5) If the supplier fails to furnish notice of a contract amendment 
to Pub. L. 480 Operations Division, FAS, within 3 working days after the 
date of such amendment, CCC has the right to refuse to finance the sale 
or any portion of the sale.
    (6) Any amendment must be consistent with the provisions of the 
purchase authorization and this part and must otherwise be acceptable to 
Pub. L. 480 Operations Division, FAS.


<R05>
Sec. 17.8  Ocean transportation.

    (a) General. (1) This section applies to the financing of ocean 
freight or ocean freight differential. Ocean freight will

[[Page 438]]

be financed by CCC only to the extent specifically provided for in the 
purchase authorization. The purchase authorization may provide 
requirements in addition to or in lieu of those specified in this 
section.
    (2) The supplier of ocean transportation must be engaged in the 
business of furnishing ocean transportation from the United States and 
must have a person, principal or agent, on whom service of judicial 
process may be had in the United States.
    (3) The quantity of the commodity which must be shipped on privately 
owned U.S.-flag commercial vessels will be determined by the Director.
    (4) The supplier of ocean transportation shall release copies of the 
ocean bills of lading to the supplier of the commodity promptly upon 
completion of loading of the vessel.
    (5) When CCC finances any part of the ocean freight or the ocean 
freight differential, the participant must open an operable irrevocable 
letter of credit for the portion of the ocean freight not financed by 
CCC. All banking institution charges, such as commissions, expenses, 
etc., are for the account of the participant. The amount of the letter 
of credit shall be computed using the information provided in the Form 
CCC-106. The letter of credit shall provide for sight payment or 
acceptance of a draft, payable in U.S. dollars, on the basis of the 
quantities specified in the applicable ocean freight contract. If the 
supplier of ocean transportation accepts the commodity before receipt of 
an acceptable letter of credit from a bank, the supplier takes such 
action at its own risk. This action in itself does not affect 
eligibility for CCC financing.
    (b) Contracting procedures--(1) Invitations for Bids (IFB's). (i) 
Public freight ``Invitations for Bids'' are required in the solicitation 
of freight offers from all U.S. and non-U.S. flag vessels when CCC is 
financing any portion of the ocean freight.
    (ii) For non-U.S. flag vessels when CCC is not financing any portion 
of the ocean freight, public freight IFB's are also required unless 
otherwise authorized by the Director, or unless the participant requires 
the use of vessels under its flag, the flag of the destination country, 
or other non-U.S. flag vessels under its control. Vessels considered to 
be under the control of the participant or the destination country 
include vessels under time charters, bare boat charters, consecutive 
voyage charters, or other contractual arrangements for the carriage of 
commodities which provide guaranteed access to vessels.
    (iii) Prior to release to the trade, all freight IFB's must be 
submitted to the Director for approval. Freight IFB's must be issued by 
means of Bridge News, New York, plus at least one other means of 
communication.
    (iv) All freight IFB's must:
    (A) Specify a closing time for the receipt of offers and state that 
late offers will not be considered;
    (B) Provide that offers are required to have a canceling date no 
later than the last contract layday specified in the IFB;
    (C) Provide the same deadline for receipt of offers from both U.S. 
flag vessels and non-U.S. flag vessels;
    (D) Stipulate the responsibility for each party for payment of any 
costs not eligible for financing by CCC (in the IFB or the pro forma 
charter party).
    (2) Competitive bidding. When CCC is financing any portion of the 
freight, all offers shall be opened in public in the United States at 
the time and place specified in the IFB. Offers shall be opened prior to 
receipt of offers for the sale of commodities as the Director determines 
appropriate. Only offers which are responsive to the IFB may be 
considered, and no negotiation shall be permitted.
    (3) Records of offers. Copies of all offers received must be 
promptly furnished to the Director, who may require the participant, or 
its shipping agent, to submit a written certification to the GSM that 
all offers received (with the times of receipt designated thereon) were 
transmitted to the Department. For purposes of this paragraph ``time of 
receipt'' shall be the time a hand-carried offer or a mailed offer was 
received at the designated location for presentation or, if transmitted 
electronically, the time the offer was received, as supported by 
evidence satisfactory to the Director.

[[Page 439]]

    (4) Re-tenders. The Director may permit or require a participant to 
refuse any and all bids, and in such case a participant may conduct a 
re-tender with the approval of the Director. The Director shall not 
approve or require freight re-tenders unless they will increase the 
likelihood of meeting U.S. flag cargo preference requirements, will 
permit the desired quantity to be shipped, will likely result in reduced 
CCC expenditures, or are otherwise determined to be in the best interest 
of the program.
    (c) Request for vessel approval. The pertinent terms of all proposed 
charters and all proposed liner bookings, regardless of whether any 
portion of ocean freight is financed by CCC, must be submitted to the 
Director for review and approval before fixture of the vessel. Tentative 
advance vessel approvals may be obtained by telephone provided Form CCC-
105, ``Ocean Shipment Data--Pub. L. 480 (Request for Vessel Approval)'', 
is furnished promptly confirming the information supplied by telephone. 
The Form CCC-105 shall be submitted in duplicate to the Director.
    (d) Advice of vessel approval. (1) USDA will give written approval 
of charters and liner bookings on Form CCC-106, ``Advice of Vessel 
Approval.'' The Form CCC-106 will state whether CCC will finance any 
part of the ocean freight. For f.a.s. or f.o.b. shipments, CCC will 
issue a signed original of Form CCC-106 to the ocean carrier when CCC 
finances any part of the ocean freight. For c.& f. or c.i.f. shipments, 
CCC will issue Form CCC-106 to the supplier of commodity.
    (2) If CCC agrees to finance any portion of the ocean freight, the 
participant or its agent shall forward a copy of the ocean freight 
contract immediately after execution to the Director for review and 
approval prior to issuance of Form CCC-106.
    (3) CCC may also require the supplier of ocean transportation to 
submit copies of lightening, stevedoring, or bagging contracts for any 
voyage for which CCC finances ocean freight or ocean freight 
differential.
    (e) Special charter party provisions required when any part of ocean 
freight is financed by CCC. This paragraph applies when CCC finances any 
part of the ocean freight for commodities booked on charter terms. In 
the event of any conflict between the provisions of the regulations in 
this part and the charter party or ocean bills of lading issued pursuant 
thereto, the provisions of the regulations in this part shall prevail. 
The charter party shall contain or, for the purpose of financing 
pursuant to the regulations in this part, be deemed to contain the 
following provisions:
    (1) That if there is any failure on the part of the supplier of 
ocean transportation to perform the charter party after the vessel has 
tendered at the loading port, the charterer shall be entitled to incur 
all expenses which in the judgment of the General Sales Manager are 
required to enable the vessel to carry out her obligations under the 
charter party including, but not limited to, expenses for lifting any 
liens asserted against the vessel.
    (2) That, notwithstanding any prior assignments of freight made by 
the owner or operator, the expenses authorized in paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section may be deducted from the freight earned under the charter 
party.
    (3) That ocean freight is earned and that 100% thereof is payable by 
the charterers when the vessel and cargo arrive at the first port of 
discharge, subject to paragraph (e)(4) of this section, and to the 
further condition that if a force majeure as described in paragraph 
(l)(1) of this section results in the loss of part of the vessel's 
cargo, 100% of the ocean freight is payable on the part so lost. This 
provision does not relieve the carrier of the obligation to carry to 
other points of discharge if so required by the charter party.
    (4) That if a force majeure as described in paragraph (l)(1) of this 
section prevents the vessel's arrival at the first port of discharge, 
the freight shall be payable by the charterer at the time the General 
Sales Manager determines that such force majeure was the cause of 
nonarrival.
    (5) That laydays are non-reversible.
    (6) That in a dispute involving any rights and obligations of CCC, 
including rights and obligations as successor or assignee, which cannot 
be settled by agreement, the dispute shall not be subject to 
arbitration.
    (f) Special charter party information required when any part of 
ocean freight is

[[Page 440]]

financed by CCC. When CCC finances any part of the ocean freight for 
commodities booked on charter terms, the charter party shall contain the 
following information:
    (1) The name of each party participating in the ocean freight 
brokerage commission, if any, and the percentage thereof payable to each 
party;
    (2) The name of the vessel and the name of the substitute vessel, if 
any.
    (g) Notice of arrival. Each Form CCC-106 will indicate whether a 
notice of arrival is required. A notice of arrival, when required, must 
be furnished promptly by the participant or its designated agent or 
other source acceptable to CCC (excluding the carrier or its agent) and 
must include the name of the vessel, the purchase authorization number, 
the first port of discharge, and the date of arrival. The notice of 
arrival of the vessel also constitutes prima facie evidence of arrival 
of the cargo.
    (h) Foreign flag vessels. The cost of ocean transportation will be 
financed by CCC on non-U.S. flag vessels only when, and to the extent, 
specifically provided in the applicable purchase authorization.
    (i) U.S.-flag vessels. When a commodity is required to be shipped on 
a privately owned U.S.-flag commercial vessel, Form CCC-106 will set 
forth:
    (1) The rate of the ocean freight differential, if any, which the 
Director determines to exist between the prevailing foreign-flag vessel 
rate and the U.S.-flag vessel rate; and
    (2) The approximate tonnage for which CCC will authorize 
reimbursement of ocean freight or ocean freight differential, as 
appropriate.
    (j) Items not eligible for financing by CCC. The following costs 
will not be financed by CCC, either separately or as part of the 
commodity contract price:
    (1) Loading, trimming, and other related shipping expenses unless 
included in the ocean freight rate;
    (2) Discharge costs unless included in the ocean freight rate;
    (3) The cost of ``dead freight'';
    (4) Cargo dues and taxes assessed by the importing or recipient 
country;
    (5) Surcharges assessed by steamship conferences or carriers, unless 
specifically authorized by the Director;
    (6) General average contributions;
    (7) Stevedoring overtime and vessel crew overtime;
    (8) Ship's disbursements;
    (9) Any payments prohibited in Sec. 17.6 (b) and (c); and
    (10) Detention.
    (k) General financing provisions. When any part of ocean freight 
will be financed either separately or as part of the commodity contract 
price, the following shall apply:
    (1) Ocean freight contracts must show the ocean freight rate from 
one loading port to one discharge port, and may provide for an increase 
in rate for an additional port of loading or discharge, or other option. 
CCC, however, will finance initially the lowest such rate or OFD, as 
appropriate. Increased amounts due because of the exercise of such 
option will be financed only after receipt of an ocean bill of lading or 
other evidence showing that the option was exercised.
    (2) In the case of transshipment to a foreign flag vessel, CCC will 
finance the ocean freight or OFD, as appropriate, only to the point of 
transshipment, at a rate determined by the GSM, and CCC will not finance 
any part of the ocean freight beyond the point of transshipment unless 
specifically approved by the GSM. If the commodity was transported from 
a U.S. port and was transshipped at another U.S. port, CCC will not 
finance, without prior approval of the GSM, any part of the ocean 
freight incurred before transshipment.
    (3) The ocean freight rate eligible for CCC financing and the rate 
used for the U.S.-flag vessel in calculating ocean freight differential 
shall not exceed the following rates for the category of the vessel 
concerned:
    (i) For commodities covered by published tariff rates--the published 
conference contract rate;
    (ii) For other commodities--the market rate prevailing at the time 
of request for approval as determined by the Director, but in any event 
not in excess of rates charged other shippers (irrespective of booking 
dates) for like commodities on the voyage concerned.
    (4) Payment will be made for ocean freight or OFD, as appropriate, 
from loading points to discharge points at

[[Page 441]]

rates approved by the Director on Form CCC-106 in conformity with 
paragraph (k)(3) of this section.
    (5) Freight for a vessel designated on Form CCC-106 as a U.S. flag 
vessel shall not be eligible for financing unless such vessel complies 
with the provisions of Pub. L. 87-266.
    (6) Ocean freight contracts must specify that the participant shall 
be liable for detention of the vessel for loading delays attributable 
solely to the decision of the supplier of ocean transportation not to 
commence loading because of the failure of the participant to establish 
an ocean freight letter of credit in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of 
this section. However, ocean freight contracts may not contain a 
specified detention rate. The ocean transportation supplier shall be 
entitled to reimbursement for detention costs for all time so lost, for 
each calendar day or any part of the calendar day, including Saturdays, 
Sundays and holidays. The period of such delay shall not commence 
earlier than upon presentation of the vessel at the designated loading 
port within the laydays specified in the ocean freight contract, and 
upon notification of the vessel's readiness to load in accordance with 
the terms of the applicable ocean freight contract. The period of such 
delay shall end at the time that operable irrevocable letters of credit 
have been established for the applicable ocean freight or the time the 
vessel begins loading, whichever is earlier. Time calculated as 
detention shall not count as laytime. Reimbursement for such detention 
shall be payable no later than upon the vessel's arrival at the first 
port of discharge.
    (l) Force majeure. (1) The GSM will waive the requirement for the 
notice of arrival required by Form CCC-106 by a written notice to the 
supplier of ocean transportation on the receipt of evidence satisfactory 
to the General Sales Manager that the vessel is lost or unable to 
proceed to destination after completion of loading as a result of one or 
more of the following causes: Damage caused by perils of the sea or 
other waters; collisions; wrecks; stranding without the fault of the 
carrier; jettison; fire from any cause; Act of God; public enemies or 
pirates; arrest or restraint of princes, rulers or peoples without the 
fault of the supplier of ocean transportation; wars; public disorders; 
captures; or detention by public authority in the interest of public 
safety. The supplier may substitute such waiver for the notice of 
arrival.
    (2) The determination of a force majeure by the GSM shall not 
relieve the participant from its obligation under the Agricultural 
Commodities Agreement to pay CCC, when due, the dollar amount of ocean 
freight, plus interest (exclusive of ocean freight differential), 
financed by CCC.
    (m) Demurrage/despatch. CCC will not finance demurrage and CCC will 
not share in despatch earnings. Owners and commodity suppliers will 
settle laytime accounts at load port(s) and owners and charterers will 
settle laytime accounts at discharge port(s). Under no circumstances 
shall CCC be responsible for resolving disputes involving calculation of 
laytime or the payment of demurrage or despatch.
    (n) Ocean freight included in the commodity contract price. For cost 
and freight or c.i.f. contracts the ocean freight, or the ocean freight 
differential, as appropriate, will be financed only to the extent 
specifically provided in the applicable purchase authorization.
    (o) Separate freight contracts. Contracts for ocean transportation, 
under a purchase authorization which limits delivery terms to f.o.b. or 
f.a.s., must be separate and apart from the contracts for the commodity.


<R05>
Sec. 17.9  CCC payment to suppliers.

    (a) General. (1) The supplier shall request payment from CCC for the 
amount of the commodity price or the ocean freight or ocean freight 
differential to be financed by CCC.
    (2) The supplier shall support such a request for payment by 
presenting to CCC the documents required by this section, the purchase 
authorization, and the IFB, unless such documents were previously 
submitted to CCC. Such documents, however, need not be submitted when 
and to the extent that the Controller determines that the intended 
purpose of a document is served by documents otherwise available to or

[[Page 442]]

under the control of CCC or by alternate documents specified in such 
determination.
    (3) CCC will examine each document to ascertain that it is in 
accordance with this part, the purchase authorization, and the IFB. CCC 
will audit all the required documents to ensure accuracy, completeness, 
and consistency. When CCC has determined that all required documents 
have been submitted and that the documents are acceptable for payment, 
CCC will pay the supplier for the commodity price or the ocean freight 
or ocean freight differential to be financed by CCC which is supported 
by the documents.
    (4) CCC is required to issue all payments by electronic transfer. 
Each supplier submitting documents to CCC for payment must provide the 
name of the company, the bank ABA number to which payment is to be made, 
the account number for the company at the bank, the company's Taxpayer 
Identification Number, and the type of account being used.
    (b) General documentation requirements. The supplier must put the 
appropriate purchase authorization number on all required documents 
which are prepared under the supplier's control, and should arrange for 
the appropriate purchase authorization number to be put on all other 
required documents at the time of their preparation.
    (c) Documents required for payment--commodity. The general 
provisions relating to such documents are as follows. Additional

the net invoice price there shall be deducted:
    (i) All discounts from the supplier's contracted price through 
payments, credits, or other allowances made or to be made to the 
importer, the importer's agent or consignee;
    (ii) All purchasing agents' commissions;
    (iii) All other amounts not eligible for financing.
    (3) Additional payment. A request for an additional payment 
submitted for a transaction for which all or part of the required 
documents have been previously submitted to CCC shall be supported by a 
Form CCC-329 ``Supplier's Certificate'' and the supplier's detailed 
invoice, covering the additional amount requested. The supplier's 
invoice must show the date, serial number and the amount of the original 
invoice and the basis for the additional amount claimed.
    (4) Weight certificate. The weight certificate shall be issued by or

    (5) Federal appeal inspection. The official certificate representing 
the results of an appeal inspection, when included in the documents 
presented for payment, shall supersede any other inspection certificate 
required by this part, the applicable purchase authorization, the IFB or 
the contract.
    (6) Form CCC-359. (i) Form FAS-359, ``Declaration of Sale,'' signed 
for the GSM, is the written document by which USDA notified the supplier 
that

[[Page 443]]

the sale was approved for financing. The supplier shall submit Form FAS-
359 to CCC with the documents covering the first transaction under the 
contract. The unit price shown on the supplier's invoice must not exceed 
the approved unit price shown on the Form FAS-359.
    (ii) For subsequent transactions under the same contract, the 
supplier shall certify on the CCC copy of the detailed invoice as

CCC. In arriving at the net invoice price the supplier shall deduct the 
ocean freight, or portion thereof which is not being financed by CCC.
    (iii) One nonnegotiable copy of the insurance certificate or policy 
where the cost of insurance is included in the price of the commodity to 
be financed by CCC.
    (iv) A request for an additional payment shall also include a

    (5) Ocean freight contract. One copy of the ocean freight contract.
    (6) Higher rated option. A request for payment of any amounts

freight or ocean freight differential to be financed by CCC before the 
vessel arrives at the first port of discharge if the supplier furnishes 
CCC financial coverage in the form of an acceptable letter of credit 
from a U.S. bank.

[[Page 444]]

    (2) The amount of security required by CCC under paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section may be computed by multiplying the ocean freight rate or 
ocean freight differential rate financed by CCC as shown on the related 
Form CCC-106 times either:
    (i) The tonnage shown on the related bill of lading, if the bill of 
lading is furnished to CCC; or
    (ii) The tonnage stated in the ocean freight contract (without

    (3) On receipt of an acceptable letter of credit, the Controller 
will issue a waiver of the notice of arrival which is required under 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (f) Advice of amount financed. CCC will forward advice of payment to 
the participant.


<R05>
Sec. 17.10  Refunds and insurance.

    (a) Participant--failure to comply. The participant shall pay in 
U.S. dollars promptly to CCC on demand by the General Sales Manager the 
entire amount financed by CCC (or such lesser amount as the GSM may 
demand) whenever the GSM determines that the participant has failed to 
comply with any agreement or commitment made by the participant in 
connection with the transaction financed or with the applicable 
Agricultural Commodities Agreement between the U.S. and the participant.
    (b) Adjustment refunds. All claims by importers for adjustment 
refunds arising out of terms of the contract or out of the normal 
customs of the trade, including arbitration and appeal awards, 
allowances, and claims for overpayment of ocean transportation, if such 
refunds relate to amounts financed by CCC, shall be settled by payment 
in U.S. dollars and such payment shall be remitted by the supplier to 
CCC. The remittance shall be identified with the date and amount of the 
original payment and the applicable purchase authorization number.
    (c) Insurance on c.i.f. sales. The provisions of this paragraph 
apply only to transactions under purchase authorizations that 
specifically authorize c.i.f. sales in which the cost of insurance is 
included in the net c.i.f. invoice price of the commodity financed. When 
the supplier furnishes insurance in favor of or for the account of the 
importer, the policies or certificates of insurance shall include a loss 
payable clause which provides that all claims shall be paid in U.S. 
dollars to the Controller. Such payments shall be accompanied by advice 
of the purchase authorization number, the names and addresses of the 
supplier and importer, the nature of the claim, the quantity of the 
commodity involved in the claim, the date of shipment, the bill of 
lading number, and the name of the vessel. CCC will credit the account 
of the participant or will refund local currency in accordance with 
paragraph (e) of this section.
    (d) Refund of ineligible amounts. If a sale has been financed and 
CCC determines that the sales price exceeds the price permissible under 
Sec. 17.5(b)(4), or that the sale is otherwise ineligible for financing, 
in whole or in part, the supplier shall refund in dollars such excess 
price or ineligible amount to CCC promptly on demand. If not promptly 
refunded, such amount may be set off by CCC against monies it owes to 
the supplier. The making of any such refund to CCC, or any such setoff 
by CCC shall not prejudice the right of the supplier to challenge such 
determination in a court action brought against CCC for recovery of the 
amount refunded or set off.
    (e) Refund of local currency or reduction of amount due. Immediately 
after receipt by CCC of U.S. dollar payment from suppliers, or from or 
for the account of the participant under this section, CCC will provide 
for payment to the participant of the local currency equivalent of 
dollars received, if such local currency has been deposited for the 
particular transaction, or will credit the participant's account as 
follows:
    (1) For payments under this section, except paragraph (a), the local 
currency refunded will be at the exchange rate agreed to by the 
Government of the United States and the participant in effect at the 
time the local currency is paid to or for the account of the importer, 
except that if there has been a change in the exchange system or 
structure of the importing country or the destination country, such 
payment shall be made at the agreed exchange rate which was in effect on 
the date of dollar disbursement for the transaction

[[Page 445]]

financed, and except further that local currency shall not be paid when 
the dollars are to be reauthorized for replacement of the commodity.
    (2) For payment under paragraph (a) of this section, the local 
currency refunded will be at the agreed exchange rate in effect on the 
date of the dollar disbursement for the transaction financed: Provided, 
that local currency will not be refunded to the extent that deposits of 
such currency have been made available to the participant on a grant 
basis.
    (3) For refunds received by CCC under long-term credit agreements 
the participant's account shall be credited with the dollar amount 
refunded or otherwise recovered, and the participant notified 
accordingly.


<R05>
Sec. 17.11  Recordkeeping and access to records.

    Suppliers and agents of the participant or importer shall keep 
accurate books, records and accounts with respect to all contracts 
entered into hereunder, including those pertaining to ocean 
transportation-related services and records of all payments by suppliers 
to representatives of the importer or participant, if CCC finances any 
part of the ocean freight. Suppliers and agents shall permit authorized 
representatives of the U.S. Government to have access to their premises 
during regular hours to inspect, examine, audit and make copies of such 
books, records and accounts. Suppliers and agents shall retain such 
records until the expiration of three years after final payment under 
such contracts.

documents pertaining hereto, the words and phrases defined in this 
section shall have the meaning assigned to them as follows:
    (a) Administrator. The Administrator, Foreign Agricultural Service, 
U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    (b) Buy-back contract. A transaction under which a reporting 
exporter having sold a commodity for export to a foreign buyer 
liquidates the export sale contract by making an offsetting purchase of 
the same kind of commodity from the same foreign buyer.
    (c) Commodity. Wheat and wheat flour, feed grains, oilseeds, cotton, 
and products thereof and any other agricultural commodity the Secretary 
may designate. ``Commodity'' shall also mean a commodity having 
identifying characteristics as described in any announcement issued 
pursuant to Sec. 20.5 such as class(es) of wheat, or staple length(s) of 
cotton. Mixed wheat shall be considered to be the predominant wheat 
class of the blend. This definition excludes commodities to be used for 
seed which have been treated in such a manner that their use is limited 
to seed for planting purposes or on which a certificate has been issued 
by a recognized seed testing laboratory setting forth variety, 
germination and purity.
    (d) Country of destination. (1) Any country outside the United 
States or (2) any territory or possession of the United States. Country 
of destination shall be the ultimate destination.
    (e) Export. A shipment of a commodity from the United States 
destined to a country specified in paragraph (d) of this section. The 
commodity shall be deemed to have been exported on the date of the 
applicable export carrier onboard bill of lading or the date the 
commodity is received for shipment, as specified on the bill of lading, 
in the case of a commodity received for shipment in a lash barge or 
containerized van if a through on-board bill of lading is issued for 
shipment to a country specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (f) Export carrier. The vessel on which a commodity is exported from 
the United States to a country specified in paragraph (d) of this 
section, or if export is by railcar, truck, or airplane, ``export 
carrier'' means such railcar, truck, or airplane.

[[Page 449]]

    (g) Exports for exporter's own account. A transaction involving 
shipments made by the reporting exporter which are unsold at the time of 
export, shipments on consignment to selling agents of the reporting 
exporter for subsequent sale for the account of the reporting exporter, 
shipments by the reporting exporter that have not been allocated to any 
outstanding export sale, and shipments from the United States to Canada 
in bond for subsequent shipment to a third country.
    (h) Export sale. A transaction entered into between a reporting 
exporter and a foreign buyer. The transaction must be represented by a 
written document evidencing that (1) the exporter agrees to export the 
commodity, (2) the foreign buyer agrees to receive the commodity, (3) a 
fixed price or an agreed upon mechanism by which such a price can be 
determined is established, and (4) payment will be made to or for the 
account of the reporting exporter by or on the behalf of the foreign 
buyer for delivery of the commodity. The quantity of ``outstanding 
export sale'' means the quantity not yet exported under an export sale. 
The terms of delivery specified in the written agreement, such as FAS 
vessel, FOB vessel, C&F, CIF, etc., do not determine whether a 
transaction is an export sale which must be reported. A transaction 
which otherwise meets this definition and is subject to the posting of 
an exporter performance bond or letter of credit from the foreign buyer 
is included in this definition and such a transaction shall be reported 
under these regulations. However, a transaction which becomes operative 
only upon the imposition of export controls is excluded from this 
definition of ``export sale'' and such a transaction shall not be 
reported under these regulations.
    (i) Foreign buyer and foreign seller. A person whose place of doing 
business with respect to the transaction is outside the United States. 
Foreign buyer or foreign seller includes a person who maintains a place 
of doing business outside the United States even though the transaction 
is concluded in the United States by his agent who has a place of 
business in the United States or by his employee who does not maintain a 
place of doing business in the United States. (If such employee 
maintains a place of doing business in the United States with respect to 
the transaction, the resulting contract is construed to be a domestic 
sale.) Notwithstanding the foregoing, all foreign governments, agencies 
and instrumentalities are considered foreign buyers or foreign sellers 
even though transactions are concluded by their employees in the United 
States or they maintain a place of business with respect to the 
transaction in the United States.
    (j) Marketing year. The reporting period specified for a commodity 
in appendix 1.
    (k) Optional origin contracts. A transaction involving an export 
sale contract between a reporting exporter and a foreign buyer under 
which the reporting exporter has the option of exporting the commodity 
from the United States or from one or more other exporting countries or 
an export sale contract under which no origin is specified.
    (l) Person. An individual, partnership, corporation, association or 
other legal entity.
    (m) Purchases from foreign sellers. A transaction involving the 
purchase of a commodity from a seller whose place of business with 
respect to the transaction is outside the United States.
    (n) Quantity. The actual contract quantity (exclusive of any upward 
or downward tolerance) specified in the agreement between the reporting 
exporter and foreign buyer or seller.
    (o) Reporting exporter. A person who enters into a transaction 
referred to in this section whose place of doing business with respect 
to such transaction is in the United States. A reporting exporter shall 
include any person who sells a commodity to a foreign buyer irrespective 
of whether or not such person may appear as the shipper on the export 
documentation or whether or not such person is required to file a 
Shipper's Export Declaration. A reporting exporter would not normally 
include agents of either the reporting exporter or foreign buyer, 
brokers, or freight forwarders unless such agents, brokers or freight 
forwarders are acting in the capacity of a principal. (See examples 
Sec. 20.6(c).)

an initial report by transmitting the information contained in the 
report forms by the use of telephone or electronic transmission. The

exported with the origin indicated as the United States or other than 
the United States.
    (iv) Quantity of optional export sales cancelled and the quantity of 
optional buy-back contracts made during the week.
    (v) Changes in destination during the week for sales previously

the week.
    (iii) Quantity of previously reported exports for exporter's own

    (vi) The total outstanding balance of exports for exporter's own 
account at the close of business for the current report.
    (b) Monthly reports. The information described in paragraph (a) of 
this section shall be reported monthly when specified by an announcement 
issued pursuant to Sec. 20.5. The forms specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section shall be utilized to furnish the information required to be 
reported monthly and such information shall be filed in the manner and 
at the time required by Sec. 20.6(k).
    (c) Exporters who are required to report. The reporting exporter has 
the sole responsibility of reporting any and all information required by 
these regulations. The following are examples of who shall be considered 
the reporting exporter for the purpose of these regulations. (Firm A in 
each example is a firm whose place of doing business with respect to the 
transaction is in the United States, and the commodity to be delivered 
under the purchase contract is subject to these regulations. See 
Sec. 20.4(i) for definition of a foreign buyer and foreign seller.)
    (1) Firm A makes an export sale to Firm B whose place of doing 
business with respect to the transaction is also in the United States. 
Firm B has made or will make an export sale to a foreign buyer. In this 
case Firm A cannot report the sale to Firm B since Firm B's place of 
doing business with respect to the transaction is located in the United 
States. In this example, Firm B is required to report the sale to the 
foreign buyer.
    (2) Firm A makes an export sale to a foreign buyer through the 
foreign buyer's agent and the agent's place of doing business with 
respect to the transaction is in the United States. In this example Firm 
A is required to report the export sale since the resulting contract is 
between Firm A and the foreign buyer.
    (3) Firm A consigns an export to his agent (other than an employee 
of Firm A). When the agent makes a sale to a foreign buyer, Firm A is 
required to report the sale. If the agent makes the sale to a firm whose 
place of doing business with respect to the transaction is in the United 
States, Firm A will not report the sale.
    (4) Firm A makes a purchase from a foreign seller. In this example, 
Firm A is required to report the purchase.
    (5) Firm A makes a purchase from an agent of a foreign seller and 
the agent's place of doing business with respect to the transaction is 
in the United States. In this example, Firm A is required to report the 
purchase. The agent is not a principal party in interest in the contract 
and cannot report the sale to Firm A. The foreign seller is not a 
reporting exporter and is not required to make a report of the sale.
    (6) Firm A, the agent of the foreign buyer, whose place of doing 
business with respect to the transaction is in the United States, 
purchases commodities domestically at interior warehouses and arranges 
for exportation to its principal, the foreign buyer. In this example, 
Firm A is required to report the sale and export.
    (7) If a reporting exporter has a transaction not described in 
paragraphs (1) through (6) of this paragraph (c) and is in doubt whether 
a transaction should be reported, the exporter should request a decision 
from the office specified in Sec. 20.10.
    (d) Contract terms. Reports of contract terms shall be filed when 
requested in accordance with Sec. 20.11. The report showing contract 
terms shall be filed on FAS-99, ``Contract Terms Supporting Export Sales 
and Foreign Purchases,'' and shall include the following:
    (1) Reporting exporter's contract number.
    (2) Date of export sale or purchase.

[[Page 452]]

    (3) Name of foreign buyer or foreign seller.
    (4) Delivery period specified in the export sale or purchase.
    (5) Delivery terms specified in the export sale or purchase (F.O.B., 
C. & F., etc.).
    (6) Actual quantity of the export sale or purchase.
    (7) Quantity not exported against the sale or foreign purchase (do 
not include any tolerance).
    (8) Country of destination.
    (9) On purchases from foreign sellers, show separately from export 
sales all items of this paragraph (d).
    (e) Reporting of destination. The reporting exporters shall report 
the country of destination specified in the export sale contract or 
otherwise declared in writing by the foreign buyer. (Where a government, 
or agency of such government, is the sole importer of the commodity in a 
country, the exporter shall report that country as the country of 
destination only if the exporter or foreign buyer has made a direct sale 
to that foreign government or agency.) If the country of destination is 
not so specified or declared, the exporter shall report the destination 
as ``unknown.'' If by the time of exportation the exporter has not so 
ascertained the country of destination, the name of the country reported 
to the Bureau of Customs of the Shipper's Export Declaration for such 
export shipment should be reported, even though it may be an 
intermediate destination. The reporting exporter is not expected to 
report destination changes made after reporting the export on FAS-98, 
``Report of Export Sales and Exports.''
    (f) Optional class or kind of commodity. If the export sale provides 
for an option as to the class or kind of commodity to be delivered under 
the export sale, the reporting exporter should report the particular 
class or kind of commodity expected to be exported.
    (g) Range in contract quantity. If the export sale provides for a 
range in quantity (e.g. 10,000 metric tons to 12,000 metric tons with or 
without a loading tolerance) with the reporting exporter or buyer having 
the option to declare a firm quantity at a later date, the reporting 
exporter shall report the maximum export sale quantity (exclusive of any 
loading tolerance). If an option is exercised for a lesser quantity at a 
later date, the reporting exporter shall report the reduction as an 
amendment to an export sale previously reported.
    (h) Transfer of unexported balances from one marketing year to the 
next marketing year. If exports against an export sale are not complete 
by the end of the marketing year in which the commodity is being 
reported for export, the reporting exporter shall transfer the quantity 
not exported against the export sale to the next marketing year on the 
first report submitted after the beginning of the new marketing year.
    (i) Errors on previous reports. Whenever an exporter discovers an 
error or is advised by the office specified in Sec. 20.10 of an error on 
a prior report, the error shall be corrected in the current weekly 
report to reflect the proper outstanding export sales and exports. The 
exporter shall also furnish a complete written explanation of such 
reporting error.
    (j) When reports are required. (1) A reporting exporter shall submit 
reports for those commodities for which there are new export sales, 
outstanding export sales, exports for exporter's own account for which 
an offsetting export sale has not been made and reported, or purchases 
from foreign sellers.
    (2) A reporting exporter may discontinue reporting for a commodity 
only when actual exports and other required reporting of changes have 
reduced to zero all export sales, exports for exporter's own account and 
purchases from foreign sellers. The reporting exporter shall report a 
zero balance prior to discontinuing reporting for the commodity 
involved.
    (3) If a reporting exporter discontinues making reports because a 
zero balance has been reached for a particular commodity, the exporter 
shall be responsible to commence reporting again once a new export sale, 
a new export for exporter's own account, or a new purchase from a 
foreign seller for that commodity is made.
    (k) Manner and time of reporting--(1) Manner. An original of all 
report forms must be filed with the office specified

[[Page 453]]

in Sec. 20.10. Each report form shall contain the full business name, 
address and telephone number of the reporting exporter and the name and 
original signature of the person submitting the report form on behalf of 
the reporting exporter. Computer generated printouts may be used in lieu 
of standard reporting forms when approved by the office specified in 
Sec. 20.10.
    (2) Time of filing reports. Information required to be reported 
weekly must be received in the office specified in Sec. 20.10 no later 
than 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on each Monday, or such other time as may 
be approved in advance by that office. Such weekly report must set forth 
the required information as to export sales transactions made during the 
seven day period ending the preceding Thursday, midnight. If Friday or 
Monday is a national holiday, the due date shall be Tuesday. If 
information is transmitted by other than use of forms specified in 
Sec. 20.6(a) (such as by use of telephone or electronic transmission) 
the required forms containing such information shall be transmitted by 
first class mail the next business day. It is the responsibility of the 
reporting exporter to arrange the most efficient and expeditious manner 
for the office specified in Sec. 20.10 to receive the reported 
information. Information required to be reported monthly must be 
received in the office specified in Sec. 20.10 no later than 5:00 p.m., 
Eastern time, the fourth business day following the end of the reporting 
month, or such other time as may be approved in advance by that office,

<R05>
Sec. 22.101  The Rural Development Act of 1972 (Pub. L. 92-419).

    The Rural Development Act of 1972 (Pub. L. 92-419), herein called 
the Act consists of six titles designed to facilitate the development of 
rural communities through a series of authorizations including grants, 
loans, and administrative provisions. This Act adds new statutory rural 
development coordination responsibilities to certain Federal departments 
and agencies to be carried out under the leadership of the Secretary of 
Agriculture.


<R05>
Sec. 22.102  Summary of authorities.

    The purpose of this section is to give notice that certain 
authorities have been delegated by the Secretary of USDA agencies for 
implementation. New Secretarial delegations covering the Rural 
Development Act were effective May 31, 1973, and were published in the 
Federal Register June 7, 1973 (38 FR 14944-14953). These are as follows:

[[Page 456]]

    (a) Title I (38 FR 14948). Responsibility delegated to the Assistant 
Secretary for Rural Development. The responsibility for administering 
loan and grant authorities is redelegated to the Farmers Home 
Administration, except the responsibility for administering loan 
authorities with respect to rural electrification and telephone 
facilities and service which has been redelegated to the Rural 
Electrification Administration.
    (b) Titles II (38 FR 14945-14948), III (38 FR 14945-14948), and V 
(38 FR 14945-14948. Responsibility delegated to the Assistant Secretary 
for Conservation, Research and Education and redelegated as follows:
    (1) Titles II (38 FR 14951-14952) and III (38 FR 14951-14952) to the 
Administrator, Soil Conservation Service.
    (2) Title V (38 FR 14949-14950) to the Administrators, Cooperative 
State Research Service and the Extension Service respectively.
    (c) Title IV (38 FR 14945-14948). Responsibility delegated to the 
Assistant Secretary for Conservation, Research and Education and 
redelegated (38 FR 14950-14951) to the Chief of the Forest Service.
    (d) Title VI, section 603 (38 FR 14948). Responsibility delegated to 
Assistant Secretary for Rural Development and redelegated (38 FR 14953) 
to the Administrator, Rural Development Service.

The Rural Development Act recognizes that many Federal departments and 
agencies of the executive branch of government administer programs and 
provide services which are applicable to the needs of rural communities. 
Section 603 of the Rural Development Act charges the Secretary of 
Agriculture with providing governmentwide leadership for, and with 
coordinating a nationwide rural development program. In such 
coordination, the Secretary shall seek measures that will achieve 
effective integration of relevant Federal services in rural areas as 
provided by Agriculture agencies and other Departments and agencies. 
This section also requires that the Secretary shall establish goals and 
report to the Congress on progress in complying with specified purposes 
of the Act. The Federal Regional Council will play a major role in 
coordination at the field level. An organic Act of the Department (7 
U.S.C. 2201) has been amended to require the Secretary to add Rural 
Development to those purposes for which he is authorized to acquire and 
diffuse useful information.


<R05>
Sec. 22.103  Purpose.

    The purpose of these regulations is to establish the policies, 
procedures, and responsibilities required by section 603 of the Rural 
Development Act.


<R05>
Sec. 22.104  General policy.

    Federal implementation of the Act will be consistent with the 
President's policy of decentralized decisionmaking and administrative 
responsibility which gives fullest possible consideration to State and 
local rural development goals and priorities. As a result of section 
817(4) of the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 
93-86) which prohibits prior approval by any State officials of any loan 
or grant under any program authorized by title I of the Rural 
Development Act of 1972 (Pub. L. 92-419), it has been necessary to 
substantially modify the planned administration of programs under 
section 603 of the Rural Development Act.


<R04>
       Subpart B--Roles and Responsibilities of Federal Government

identification and application of available resources. States may 
authorize direct communications and liaison between the Regional 
Councils and multicounty jurisdictions within States.


<R05>
Sec. 22.304  Multiyear planning and programming.

    State and multicounty jurisdictions are encouraged to adopt 
multiyear planning and development programs. As administrative 
procedures for implementing the Act support the feasibility of such a 
process, these programs should consider joint State, Federal, and local 
budget planning factors and be refined to conform to the actual fund 
availability as annual budgets are finalized and allocated. Such 
programs,

[[Page 460]]

once initiated, will be extended by the annual addition of a new 
planning year until programs are completed or terminated.


<R05>
Sec. 22.305  Conformance with OMB Circular No. A-95.

    The State and multicounty jurisdictional rural development planning 
process must conform to the review requirements expressed in OMB 
Circular No. A-95 under parts I, III, and IV as appropriate.

assistance program or other available Federal planning programs.


<R05>
Sec. 22.307  Program evaluation.

    The Department of Agriculture is responsible for continuous program 
evaluation to determine if individual projects and the entire program is 
cost effective in terms of reaching rural development goals. As a 
result, USDA is responsible for conducting and reporting an annual 
evaluation of selected rural development projects and the overall rural 
development program. USDA shall include as a part of its evaluation 
Federal Regional Council assessment of the effectiveness of interagency 
coordination and delivery of services within the overall rural 
development program. States and multicounty districts are encouraged to 
participate in the joint preparation of such program evaluations. Copies 
of such evaluations should be supplied to the Administrator, Rural 
Development Service, Department of Agriculture and to the Federal 
Regional Councils, in sufficient time so as to arrive not later than 
July 1. The initial evaluation, due July 1, 1974, in addition to the 
requirements listed below, should include a background statement and 
should summarize first year program efforts and results. Annual 
evaluation should:
    (a) Describe the process used in planning, project selection and 
priority setting, and the criteria and process used in evaluating 
program effectiveness.
    (b) Describe the specific objectives of the programs.
    (c) Describe and assess the cost and effectiveness of projects being 
pursued within individual multicounty jurisdictions.
    (d) Express observations, conclusions and recommendations based on 
such evaluations which may contribute to the development of better 
management, coordination and planning procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 22.308  Project approval.

    State and multicounty jurisdictional planning is a State and local 
prerogative. Federal agencies will be responsive to State rural 
development strategies and priorities. However, determination of 
eligibility and feasibility and final approval of individual projects 
involving Federal funds must remain with the Federal government 
consistent with the Act and implementing regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 22.309  Seeking Federal review.

    States may, if they elect, submit multicounty development plans and 
proposals to the Federal Regional Councils and to the Rural Development 
Service, USDA, for review and comment. Such review will neither obligate 
the Federal government with respect to such programs nor require States 
to conform with suggestions supplied by the USDA or the Federal Regional 
Council.

the State. The designated official will be responsible for the overall 
coordination of planning, organizing, funding, conducting and evaluating 
programs in association with the person responsible for the 
administration of research programs, the person responsible for the 
administration of the extension programs, and the administrative head of 
agriculture of the University (chairman of the State Rural Development 
Advisory Council).


<R05>
Sec. 23.4  State Rural Development Advisory Council.

    (a) The chief administrative officer of the administratively 
responsible State Land Grant University will appoint a State Rural 
Development Advisory Council with membership as set forth in section 
504(e) of title V. The function of the Council shall be to review

[[Page 462]]

and approve annual program plans conducted under title V. The Council 
will also advise the chief administrative officer on all matters 
pertaining to the authorized programs.
    (b) The Chairman of the State Rural Development Advisory Council 
will insure that programs proposed under title V including regional 
programs applicable within the State are not inconsistent with and are, 
to a maximum extent practicable, in consonance with other rural 
development programs and activities approved in that State.
    (c) Those elements of the research and extension plan which would 
impact directly on rural development activities being developed or 
pursued by States will be considered jointly by the State Rural 
Development Advisory Council and appropriate State agencies to assure a 
constructive reinforcement of those State activities.


<R05>
Sec. 23.5  Availability of funds.

    Funds available under title V for extension and research programs 
shall be allocated to, and following approval of a State Annual Plan of 
Work, paid to the official of the State Land Grant University designated

<R05>
Sec. 23.9  General.

    (a) Section 503(b)(2), title V, of the Rural Development Act of 1972 
(Pub. L. 92-419) hereafter referred to as ``Title V'' authorizes funds 
to finance work authorized under title V which serve two or more States; 
in which universities in two or more States cooperate; or which is 
conducted by one University serving two or more States. The authorized 
funding under section 503(b)(2) is hereafter referred to as the 
``Regional Programs.''
    (b) The Regional Programs shall develop and provide knowledge 
essential to assist and support rural development in the region, and 
shall provide for technical consultation and personnel development for 
the research and extension staff in the several States of the region to 
help them to be more responsive to rural development needs and 
activities.
    (c) The Regional Programs will concentrate on the high priority 
knowledge, training, and personnel needs required for the research and 
extension staff in the several States to conduct effective rural 
development research and extension to carry out the provisions of title 
V. These efforts may include personnel development and consultation; 
synthesis of existing research knowledge and the interpretation of this 
knowledge for rural development program and policy purposes; the 
development of strategies and procedures on high priority rural 
development problems of regional significance; as funds permit, the 
conduct of research on one of two high priority problems for which 
information is lacking but is urgently needed for rural development, and 
the evaluation of rural development programs and policies.

[[Page 464]]

    (d) Regional Programs will be consonant with all rural development 
activities under the Act and other pertinent Federal development 
programs. To effectuate such purpose, the Assistant Secretary for 
Conservation, Research and Education will implement title V plans and 
activities in close cooperation with the Assistant Secretary for Rural 
Development. In order to insure such consonance, the Director of each 
Regional Center will insure that regional programs having an impact 
within one or more States are brought to the attention of the 
appropriate State overall coordinator for consideration pursuant to 
procedures in Sec. 23.4(c).


<R05>

and the regulations of this subpart. Regions as delineated for purposes 
under section 503(b)(2) will be coterminous with the regional 
delineation by the National Association of State Universities and Land 
Grant Colleges. Each Regional Center will be established by the regional 
association of State Agricultural Experiment Station Directors and the 
regional organization of Cooperative Extension Directors in the region 
to be served by the Regional Center. These associations and 
organizations will designate the location of the Regional Center.
    (b) Although the Regional Center will administer the program, it is 
also expected that it will draw on expertise from outside the Regional 
Center. The Director of each Regional Center shall seek advice and 
assistance from regional and subregional committees, groups or persons 
who can contribute to the Regional Center's program.


<R05>
Sec. 23.11  Board of Directors.

    (a) For each Regional Center there shall be a Board of Directors 
selected by the Regional Association of Agricultural Experiment Station 
Directors and the Regional Organization of Cooperative State Extension 
Directors. Membership on the Board of Directors shall include 
representatives from State Cooperative Extension Services and State 
Agricultural Experiment Stations from the States in the region and/or 
other State administrators of programs carried out under title V in the 
region.
    (b) The Director of each Regional Center will be responsible to the 
Board of Directors for the Regional Program conducted at that Regional 
Center. The Regional Annual Plan of Work will be developed by the 
Director and reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors.


<R05>
Sec. 23.12  Availability of funds.

    Available funds will be allocated equally and following approval of 
a Regional Annual Plan of Work paid to the Directors of the four

to be funded under section 503(b)(2) of title V shall be prepared. The 
Plan of Work should include:
    (1) A brief narrative statement including identification of high 
priority knowledge, skill, and organization needs for rural development 
program and policy purposes in the region and identification of 
technical consultation, training, and personnel needs of research and 
extension workers in support of rural development programs.
    (2) A statement indicating:
    (i) The types of personnel to be trained, technical consultation to 
be conducted, the estimated number of participants, the location or 
locations where the program will be conducted, and the staff who will 
conduct the work;
    (ii) The types of topical areas of rural development for which the 
synthesis of available research knowledge for rural development purposes 
is planned;

[[Page 465]]

    (iii) The type of high priority rural development research which 
will be undertaken as funds permit and the staff which would do the 
research;
    (iv) The type of evaluation studies which will be made and the staff

Assistant Secretary for Conservation, Research and Education.
    (b) The Plan of Work shall be coordinated with the work program of 
other pertinent multi-State organizations or bodies for those activities 
of the Regional Rural Development Centers which go beyond direct 
assistance to individual State programs conducted under title V.
    (c) The Director of the Center will forward four copies of the Plan 
of Work to the Assistant Secretary for Conservation, Research and 
Education, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C. 20250, by a 
time to be specified by the Assistant Secretary for Conservation, 
Research and Education.
    (d) Regional Annual Plans of Work not meeting the above criteria

    (b) Duties of the Appellant. Within 30 days after receipt of a copy 
of the appeal file assembled by the contracting officer, the appellant 
shall transmit to the Board any documents not contained therein which 
the appellant considers relevant to the appeal, and shall transmit 
copies of such documents to the Government attorney and the contracting 
officer.
    (c) Organization of Appeal File. Documents in the appeal file may be 
originals or legible facsimiles or authenticated copies, and shall be 
arranged in chronological order where practicable, numbered 
sequentially, tabbed, and indexed to identify the contents of the file.
    (d) Lengthy Documents. Upon request by either party, the Board may 
waive the requirement to furnish to the other party copies of bulky, 
lengthy, or out-of-size documents in the appeal file when inclusion 
would be burdensome. At the time a party files with the Board a document 
as to which such a waiver has been granted such party shall notify the 
other party that the document or a copy is available for inspection at 
the offices of the Board or of the party filing same.
    (e) Status of Documents in Appeal File. Documents contained in the 
appeal file are considered, without further action by the parties, as 
part of the record upon which the Board will render its decision. 
However, a party may object, for reasons stated, to consideration of a 
particular document or documents reasonably in advance of hearing, or if 
there is no hearing, of settling the record. If such objection is made 
the Board shall remove the document or documents from the appeal file 
and permit the party offering the

[[Page 470]]

document to move its admission as evidence either prior to hearing or 
prior to closing the record if there is no hearing, in accordance with 
Rules 13 and 20.
    (f) Dispensing with Appeal File Requirements. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, the filing of the Rule 4 (a) and (b) documents may be 
dispensed with by the Board either upon request of the appellant in the 
notice of appeal or thereafter upon stipulation of the parties.

               Rule 5. Dismissal for Lack of Jurisdiction

    Any motion addressed to the jurisdiction of the Board shall be 
promptly filed. Hearing on the motion shall be afforded on application 
of either party. However, the Board may defer its decision on the motion 
pending hearing on both the merits and the motion. The Board shall have 
the right to any time and on its own initiative to raise the issue of 
its jurisdiction to proceed with a particular case, and shall do so by 
an appropriate order, affording the parties an opportunity to be heard 
thereon.

                            Rule 6. Pleadings

    (a) Appellant--Complaint. Except as provided in Rule 12.2(b) and 
Rule 12.3(b), within 30 days after receipt of notice of docketing of the 
appeal, the appellant shall file with the Board an original and two 
copies of a Complaint setting forth simple, concise and direct 
statements of each of its claims. Appellant shall also set forth the 
basis, with appropriate reference to contract provisions, of each claim 
and the dollar amount claimed, to the extent known. This pleading shall 
fulfill the generally recognized requirements of a Complaint, although 
no particular form is required. Upon receipt of the Complaint, the Board 
shall serve a copy of it upon the Government and the contracting 
officer. Should the Complaint not be filed within 30 days, appellant's 
claim and appeal may, if in the opinion of the Board the issues before 
the Board are sufficiently defined, be deemed to set forth its Complaint 
and the Government shall be so notified.
    (b) Government--Answer. Within 30 days from receipt of the 
Complaint, or the aforesaid notice from the Board, the Government shall 
prepare and file with the Board an original and one copy of an Answer 
thereto. The Answer shall set forth simple, concise, and direct 
statements of Government's defenses to each claim asserted by appellant, 
including any affirmative defenses available, and shall be served on the 
appellant and the contracting officer. Should the Answer not be filed 
within 30 days, the Board may, in its discretion, enter a general denial 
on behalf of the Government, and the appellant shall be so notified.

                Rule 7. Amendments of Pleadings or Record

    The Board upon its own initiative or upon application by a party may 
order a party to make a more definite statement of the Complaint or 
Answer, or to reply to an Answer. The Board may, in its discretion, and 
within the proper scope of the appeal, permit either party to amend its 
pleading upon conditions fair to both parties. When issues within the 
proper scope of the appeal, but not raised by the pleadings, are tried 
by express or implied consent of the parties, or by permission of the 
Board, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised 
therein. In such instances, motions to amend the pleadings to conform to 
the proof may be entered, but are not required. If evidence is objected 
to at a hearing on the ground that it is not within the issues raised by 
the pleadings, it may be admitted within the proper scope of the appeal, 
provided, however, that the objecting party may be granted a continuance 
if necessary to enable it to meet such evidence.

                        Rule 8. Hearing Election

    After filing of the Government's Answer or notice from the Board 
that it has entered a general denial on behalf of the Government, each 
party shall advise whether it desires a hearing as prescribed in Rules 
17 through 25, or whether it elects to submit its case on the record 
without a hearing, as prescribed in Rule 11.

                        Rule 9. Prehearing Briefs

    Based on an examination of the pleadings, and its determination of 
whether the arguments and authorities addressed to the issues are 
adequately set forth therein, the Board may, in its discretion, require 
the parties to submit prehearing briefs in any case in which a hearing 
has been elected pursuant to Rule 8. If the Board does not require 
prehearing briefs either party may, in its discretion and upon 
appropriate and sufficient notice to the other party, furnish a 
prehearing brief to the Board. In any case where a prehearing brief is 
submitted, it shall be furnished so as to be received by the Board at 
least 15 days prior to the date set for hearing, and a copy shall 
simultaneously be furnished to the other party as previously arranged.

             Rule 10. Prehearing or Presubmission Conference

    (a) Conference. Whether the case is to be submitted pursuant to Rule 
11, or heard pursuant to Rules 17 through 25, the Board may upon its own 
initiative, or upon the application of either party, arrange a telephone 
conference or call upon the parties to appear before an Administrative 
Judge or examiner of the Board of a conference to consider:

[[Page 471]]

    (1) Simplification, clarification, or severing of the issues;
    (2) The possibility of obtaining stipulations, admissions, 
agreements and rulings on admissibility of documents, understandings on 
matters already of record, or similar agreements that will avoid 
unnecessary proof;
    (3) Agreements and rulings to facilitate discovery;
    (4) Limitation of the number of expert witnesses, or avoidance of 
similar cumulative evidence;
    (5) The possibility of agreement disposing of any or all of the 
issues in dispute; and
    (6) Such other matters as may aid in the disposition of the appeal.
    (b) Written Results of Conference. The Administrative Judge or 
examiner of the Board shall make such rulings and orders as may be 
appropriate to achieve settlement by agreement of the parties or to aid 
in the disposition of the appeal. The results of pretrial conferences, 
including any rulings and orders, shall be reduced to writing by the 
Administrative Judge or examiner and this writing shall thereafter 
constitute a part of the record.

                  Rule 11. Submission Without a Hearing

    Either party may elect to waive a hearing and to submit its case 
upon the record before the Board, as settled pursuant to Rule 13. 
Submission of a case without hearing does not receive the parties from 
the necessity of proving the facts supporting their allegations or 
defenses. Affidavits, depositions, admissions, answer to 
interrogatories, and stipulations may be employed to supplement other 
documentary evidence in the Board record. The Board may permit such 
submission to be supplemented by oral argument (transcribed if 
requested), and by briefs arranged in accordance with Rule 23.

  Rule 12. Optional SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) and ACCELERATED Procedures

    Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Rules of Procedure, 
the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) and ACCELERATED procedures shall be 
available solely at the election of the appellant.

Rule 12.1. Elections to Utilize SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) and ACCELERATED 
                               Procedures

    (a) SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED)--$50,000 or less. In appeals where the 
amount in dispute is $50,000 or less, the appellant may elect to have 
the appeal processed under a SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure 
requiring decision of the appeal, whenever possible, within 120 days 
after the Board receives written notice of the appellant's election. The 
details of this procedure appear in Rule 12.2.
    (b) ACCELERATED--$100,000 or less. In appeals where the amount in 
dispute is $100,000 or less, the appellant may elect to have the appeal 
processed under an ACCELERATED procedure requiring decision of the 
appeal, whenever possible, within 180 days after the Board receives 
written notice of the appellant's election. The details of this 
procedure appear in Rule 12.3.
    (c) Time for Election. The appellant's election of either the SMALL 
CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure or the ACCELERATED procedure may be made by 
written notice within 60 days after receipt of notice of docketing the 
appeal unless such period is extended by the Board for good cause. The 
election may not be withdrawn except with permission of the Board and 
for good cause.
    (d) Board Determines Amount in Dispute. In deciding whether the 
SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure or the ACCELERATED procedure is 
applicable to a given appeal, the Board shall determine the amount in 
dispute.

            Rule 12.2. The SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) Procedure

    (a) Time Periods for Proceedings. In cases proceeding under the 
SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure, the following time periods shall 
apply: (1) Within ten days from the Government's first receipt from 
either the appellant or the Board of a copy of the appellant's notice of 
election of the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure, the Government shall 
send the Board a copy of the contract, the contracting officer's final 
decision, and the appellant's claim letter or letters, if any; remaining 
documents required under Rule 4 shall be submitted in accordance with 
times specified in that rule unless the Board otherwise directs;
    (2) Within 15 days after the Board has acknowledged receipt of 
appellant's notice of election, the assigned Administrative Judge shall 
take the following actions, if feasible, in an informal meeting or a 
telephone conference with both parties: (i) Identify and simplify the 
issues; (ii) establish a simplified procedure appropriate to the 
particular appeal involved; (iii) determine whether the appellant wants 
a hearing, and if so, fix a time and place therefore; (iv) require the 
Government to furnish all the additional documents relevant to the 
appeal, and (v) establish an expedited schedule for resolution of the 
appeal.
    (b) Decisions--120 Days). Pleadings, discovery and other prehearing 
activity will be allowed only as consistent with the requirement to 
conduct the hearing on the date scheduled, or if no hearing is 
scheduled, to close the record on a date that will allow decisions 
within the 120-day limit. The Board, in its discretion, may impose 
shortened time periods for any actions prescribed or allowed under these 
rules, as necessary to enable the

[[Page 472]]

Board to decide the appeal within the 120-day limit, allowing whatever 
time, up to 30 days, that the Board considers necessary for the 
preparation of the decision after closing the record and the filing of 
briefs, if any.
    (c) Form of Decisions. Written decision by the Board in cases 
processed under the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure will be short and 
contain only summary findings of fact and conclusions. Decisions will be 
rendered for the Board by a single Administrative Judge. If there has 
been a hearing, the Administrative Judge presiding at the hearing may, 
in the Judge's discretion, at the conclusion of the hearing and after 
entertaining such oral arguments as deemed appropriate, render on the 
record oral summary findings of fact, conclusions, and a decision of the 
appeal. Whenever such an oral decision is rendered, the Board will 
subsequently furnish the parties a typed copy of such oral decision for 
record and payment purposes and to establish the starting date for the 
period for filing a motion for reconsideration under Rule 29.
    (d) No Precedent--Not Appealable. A decision against the Government 
or the contractor shall have no value as precedent, and in the absence 
of fraud shall be final and conclusive and may not be appealed or set 
aside.

                  Rule 12.3. The ACCELERATED Procedure

    (a) Time Periods for Proceedings. In cases proceeding under the 
ACCELERATED procedure, the parties are encouraged, to the extent 
possible consistent with adequate presentation of their factual and 
legal positions, to waive pleadings, discovery, and briefs. The Board, 
in its discretion, may shorten time periods prescribed elsewhere in 
these Rules, including Rule 4, as necessary to enable the Board to 
decide the appeal within 180 days after the Board has received the 
appellant's notice of election of the ACCELERATED procedure, any may 
reserve 30 days for preparation of the decision.
    (b) Decisions--180 Days. Pleadings, discovery and other prehearing 
activity will be allowed only as consistent with the requirement to 
conduct the hearing on the dates scheduled, or if no hearing is 
scheduled, to close the record on a date that will allow decision within 
the 180-day limit. The Board, in its discretion, may impose shortened 
time periods for any actions prescribed or allowed under these rules, as 
necessary to enable the Board to decide the appeal within the 180-day 
limit, allowing whatever time, up to 30 days, that the Board considers 
necessary for the preparation of the decision after closing the record 
and the filing of briefs, if any.
    (c) Form of Decisions. Written decisions by the Board in cases 
processed under the ACCELERATED procedure will normally be short and 
contain only summary findings of fact and conclusions. Decisions will be 
rendered for the Board by a single Administrative Judge with the 
concurrence of the Chair or a Vice Chair or other designated 
Administrative Judge, or by a majority among these two and an additional 
designated member in case of disagreement. Alternatively, in cases where 
the amount in dispute is $50,000 or less as to which the ACCELERATED 
procedure has been elected and in which there has been a hearing, the 
single Administrative Judge presiding at the hearing may, with the 
concurrence of both parties, at the conclusion of the hearing and after 
entertaining such oral arguments as deemed appropriate, render on the 
record oral summary findings of fact, conclusions, and a decision of the 
appeal. Whenever such an oral decision is rendered, the Board will 
subsequently furnish the parties a typed copy of such oral decision for 
record and payment purposes and to establish the starting date for the 
period for filing a motion for reconsideration under Rule 29.

         Rule 12.4. Motions for Reconsideration in Rule 12 Cases

    Motions for Reconsideration of cases decided under either the SMALL 
CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure or the ACCELERATED procedure need not be 
decided within the original 120-day or 180-day limit, but all such 
motions shall be processed and decided rapidly so as to fulfill the 
intent of this Rule.

                      Rule 13. Settling the Record

    (a) Components of the Record. The record upon which the Board's 
decision will be rendered consists of the documents furnished under 
Rules 4 and 12, to the extent admitted in evidence, and the following 
items, if any: pleadings, prehearing conference memoranda or orders, 
prehearing briefs, depositions or interrogatories received in evidence, 
admissions, stipulations, transcripts of conferences and hearings, 
hearings exhibits, posthearing briefs, and documents which the Board has 
specifically designated be made a part of the record. The record will, 
at all reasonable times, be available for inspection by the parties at 
the office of the Board.
    (b) Closing Dates for Inclusion of Material. Except as the Board may 
otherwise order in its discretion, no proof shall be received in 
evidence after completion of an oral hearing or, in cases submitted on 
the record, after notification by the Board that the case is ready for 
decision.
    (c) Weight Given to Evidence. The weight to be attached to any 
evidence of record will rest within the sound discretion of the Board. 
The Board may in any case require either party, with appropriate notice 
to the other party, to submit additional evidence on any matter relevant 
to the appeal.

[[Page 473]]

                     Rule 14. Discovery--Depositions

    (a) General Policy and Protective Orders. The parties are encouraged 
to engage in voluntary discovery procedures. In connection with any 
deposition or other discovery procedure, the Board may make any order 
required to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, or 
undue burden or expense. Those orders may include limitations on the 
scope, method, time and place for discovery, and provisions for 
protecting the secrecy of confidential information or documents.
    (b) When Depositions Permitted. After an appeal has been docketed 
and Complaint filed, the parties may mutually agree, or the Board may, 
upon application of either party, order the taking of testimony of any 
person by deposition upon oral examination or written interrogatories 
before any officer authorized to administer oaths at the place of 
examination, for use as evidence or for purpose of discovery. The 
application for order shall specify whether the purpose of the 
deposition is discovery or for use as evidence.
    (c) Orders on Depositions. The time, place, and manner of taking 
depositions shall be as mutually agreed by the parties, or failing such 
agreement, governed by order of the Board.
    (d) Use as Evidence. No testimony taken by depositions shall be 
considered as part of the evidence in the hearing of an appeal until 
such testimony is offered and received in evidence at such hearing. It 
will not ordinarily be received in evidence if the deponent is present 
and can testify at the hearing. In such instances, however, the 
deposition may be used to contradict or impeach the testimony of the 
deponent given at the hearing. In cases submitted on the record, the 
Board may, in its discretion, receive depositions to supplement the 
record.
    (e) Expenses. Each party shall bear its own expenses associated with 
the taking of any deposition.
    (f) Subpoenas. Where appropriate, a party may request the issuance 
of a subpoena under the provisions of Rule 21.

Rule 15. Interrogatories to Parties, Admission of Facts, and Production 
                       and Inspection of Documents

    After an appeal has been docketed and Complaint filed with the 
Board, a party may serve on the other party: (a) Written interrogatories 
to be answered separately in writing, signed under oath and answered or 
objected to within 30 days; (b) a request for the admission of specified 
facts and the authenticity of any documents, to be answered or objected 
to within 30 days after service (the factual statements and the 
authenticity of the documents to be deemed admitted upon failure of a 
party to respond to the request); and (c) a request for the production, 
inspection and copying of any documents or objects not privileged, which 
reasonably may lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Any 
discovery engaged in under this Rule shall be subject to the provisions 
of Rule 14(a) with respect to general policy and protective orders and 
of Rule 33 with respect to sanctions.

             Rule 16. Service of Papers Other Than Subpoenas

    (a) Service of Papers. Papers shall be served personally or by 
certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the Board or to 
the party upon whom service is to be made. Parties shall furnish three 
copies of Complaints directly to the Board. Parties shall furnish two 
copies of Answers and briefs directly with the Board, with one copy 
being served on the opposing party and the Board's copies containing a 
notation to that effect. The party filing any other paper with the Board 
shall send a copy thereof to the opposing party, noting on the paper 
filed with the Board that a copy has been so furnished. Subpoenas shall 
be served as provided in Rule 21.
    (b) Facsimle Transmissions. Facsimile transmissions to the Board and 
the parties are permitted. Parties are expected to submit their 
facsimile machine numbers with their filings. The Board's facsimile 
number is (202) 720-3059. The filing of a document by facsimile 
transmission occurs upon receipt by the Board of the entire printed 
submission. Parties are specifically cautioned that deadlines for the 
filing of appeals will not be extended merely because the Board's 
facsimile machine is busy or otherwise unavailable at the time the 
filing is due. A document submitted by facsimile should be followed by a 
copy of the document sent by U.S. Postal Service or other delivery 
method.

                                Hearings

                      Rule 17. Where and When Held

    Hearings will be held at such places determined by the Board to best 
serve the interests of the parties and the Board. Hearings will be 
scheduled at the discretion of the Board with due consideration to the 
regular order of appeals, Rule 12 requirements, and other pertinent 
factors. On request on motion by either party and for good cause, the 
Board may, in its discretion, adjust the date of a hearing.

                       Rule 18. Notice of Hearings

    The parties shall be given at least 15 days notice of the time and 
place set for hearings. In scheduled hearings, the Board will consider 
the desires of the parties and the requirement for just and inexpensive 
determination of appeals without unnecessary delay.

[[Page 474]]

                  Rule 19. Unexcused Absence of a Party

    The unexcused absence of a party at the time and place set for 
hearing will not be occasion for delay. In the event of such absence, 
the hearing will proceed and the case will be regarded as submitted by 
the absent party as provided in Rule 11.

           Rule 20. Hearings: Nature; Examination of Witnesses

    (a) Nature of Hearings. Hearings shall be as informal as may be 
reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. Appellant and the 
Government may offer such evidence as they deem appropriate and as would 
be admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence. Stipulations of fact 
agreed upon by the parties may be regarded and used as evidence at the 
hearing. The parties may stipulate the testimony that would be given by 
a witness if the witness were present. The Board may require evidence in 
addition to that offered by the parties.
    (b) Examination of Witnesses. Witnesses before the Board will be 
examined orally under oath or affirmation, unless the presiding 
Administrative Judge or examiner shall otherwise order. If the testimony 
of a witness is not given under oath, the Board may advise the witness 
that his statements may be subject to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 287 
and 1001, and any other provision of law imposing penalties for 
knowingly making false representations in connection with claims against 
the United States or in any matter within the jurisdiction of any 
department or agency thereof.

                   Rule 21. Subpoenas for CDA Appeals

    (a) General. For appeals under Sec. 24.4(a), upon written request of 
either party filed with the recorder, or on the initiative of the 
Administrative Judge to whom a case is assigned, or who is otherwise 
designated by the Chair, such Administrative Judge may issue a subpoena 
requiring:
    (1) Testimony at a deposition--the deposing of a witness in the city 
or county where such witness resides or is employed or transacts 
business in person, or at another location convenient for such witness 
that is specifically determined by the Board;
    (2) Testimony at a hearing--the attendance of a witness for the 
purpose of taking testimony at a hearing; and
    (3) Production of books and papers--in addition to (1) or (2), the 
production by the witness at the deposition or hearing of books and 
papers designated in the subpoena.
    (b) Voluntary Cooperation. Each party is expected (1) to cooperate 
and make available witnesses and evidence under its control as requested 
by the other party, without issuance of a subpoena, and (2) to secure 
voluntary attendance of desired third-party witnesses and production of 
desired third-party books, papers, documents, or tangible things 
whenever possible.
    (c) Requests for Subpoenas.
    (1) A request for a subpoena shall normally be filed at least:
    (i) 15 days before a scheduled deposition where the attendance of a 
witness at a deposition is sought;
    (ii) 30 days before a scheduled hearing where the attendance of a 
witness at a hearing is sought.
    In its discretion the Board may honor requests for subpoenas not 
made within these time limitations.
    (2) A request for a subpoena shall state the reasonable scope and 
general relevance to the case of the testimony and of any books and 
papers sought.
    (d) Requests to Quash or Modify. Upon written request by the person 
subpoenaed or by a party, made within 10 days after service but in any 
event not later than the time specified in the subpoena for compliance, 
the Board may (1) quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable and 
oppressive or for other good cause shown, or (2) require the person in 
whose behalf the subpoena was issued to advance the reasonable cost of 
producing subpoenaed books and papers. Where circumstances require, the 
Board may act upon such a request at any time after a copy has been 
served upon the opposing party.
    (e) Form; Issuance.
    (1) Every subpoena shall state the name of the Board and the title 
of the appeal, and shall command each person to whom it is directed to 
attend and give testimony, and if appropriate, to produce specified 
books and papers at a time and place therein specified. In issuing a 
subpoena to a requesting party, the Administrative Judge shall sign the 
subpoena and may, in the Judge's discretion, enter the name of the 
witness and otherwise leave it blank. The party to whom the subpoena is 
issued shall complete the subpoena before service.
    (2) Where the witness is located in a foreign country, a letter 
rogatory or subpoena may be issued and served under the circumstances 
and in the manner provided in 28 U.S.C. 1781-1784.
    (f) Service.
    (1) The party requesting issuance of a subpoena shall arrange for 
service.
    (2) A subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at a deposition 
or hearing may be served at any place. A subpoena may be served by a 
United States marshal or deputy marshal, or by any other person who is 
not a party and not less than 18 years of age. Service of a subpoena 
upon a person named therein shall be made by personally delivering a 
copy to that person and tendering the fees for one day's attendance and 
the mileage provided by 28 U.S.C. 1821 or other applicable law; however, 
where the subpoena is issued on behalf of the Government,

[[Page 475]]

money payments need not be tendered in advance of attendance.
    (3) The party at whose instance a subpoena is issued shall be 
responsible for the payment of fees and mileage of the witness and of 
the officer who serves the subpoena. The failure to make payment of such 
charges on demand may be deemed by the Board as sufficient ground for 
striking the testimony of the witness and the evidence the witness has 
produced.
    (g) Contumacy or Refusal to Obey a Subpoena. In case of contumacy or 
refusal to obey a subpoena by a person who resides, is found, or 
transacts business within the jurisdiction of a United States District 
Court, the Board will apply to the Court through the Attorney General of 
the United States for an order requiring the person to appear before the 
Board or a member thereof to give testimony or produce evidence or both. 
Any failure of any such person to obey the order of the Court may be 
punished by the Court as a contempt thereof.

                Rule 21.1. Subpoenas for Non-CDA Appeals

    For appeals under Secs. 24.4(b), (c), and (d), the Chair has 
authority by delegation from the Secretary to request the appropriate 
United States Attorney to apply to the appropriate United States 
District Court for the issuance of subpoenas pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 304.

                        Rule 22. Copies of Papers

    When books, records, papers, or documents have been received in 
evidence, a true copy thereof or of such part thereof as may be material 
or relevant may be substituted therefor, during the hearing or at the 
conclusion thereof.

                       Rule 23. Posthearing Briefs

    Posthearing briefs may be submitted upon such terms as may be agreed 
upon by the parties and the presiding Administrative Judge or examiner 
at the conclusion of the hearing.

                   Rule 24. Transcript of Proceedings

    Testimony and argument at hearings shall be reported verbatim, 
unless the Board otherwise orders. Waiver of transcript may be 
especially suitable for hearings under Rule 12.2. Transcripts or copies 
of the proceedings shall be made available by the Board to the 
Government attorney. Appellant may order transcripts of the proceedings 
from the contract reporter at the hearing.

                     Rule 25. Withdrawal of Exhibits

    After a decision has become final, the Board may, upon request and 
after notice to the other party, in its discretion permit the withdrawal 
of original exhibits, or any part thereof, by the party entitled 
thereto. The substitution of true copies of exhibits or any part thereof 
may be required by the Board in its discretion as a condition of 
granting permission for such withdrawal.

                             Representation

                         Rule 26. The Appellant

    An individual appellant may appear before the Board in person; a 
corporation by one of its officers; and a partnership or joint venture 
by one of its members; or any of these by an attorney at law duly 
licensed in any state, commonwealth, territory, the District of 
Columbia, or in a foreign country. An attorney representing an appellant 
shall file a written notice of appearance with the Board.

                         Rule 27. The Government

    Government counsel may, in accordance with their authority, 
represent the interest of the Government before the Board. They shall 
file notices of appearance with the Board, and notice thereof will be 
given appellant or appellant's attorney in the form specified by the 
Board from time to time. Whenever appellant and the Government counsel 
are in agreement as to disposition of the controversy, the Board may 
suspend further processing of the appeal. However, if the Board is 
advised thereafter by either party that the controversy has not been 
disposed of by agreement, the case shall be restored to the Board's 
calendar without loss of position.

                              Miscellaneous

                           Rule 28. Decisions

    Decisions of the Board will be made in writing and authenticated 
copies of the decision will be forwarded simultaneously to both parties. 
The rules of the Board and all final orders and decisions (except those 
required for good cause to be held confidential and not cited as 
precedents) shall be open for public inspection at the offices of the 
Board in Washington, D.C. Decisions of the Board will be made solely 
upon the record, as described in Rule 13.

                   Rule 29. Motion for Reconsideration

    A motion for reconsideration may be filed by either party. It shall 
set forth specifically the grounds relied upon to sustain the motion. 
The motion shall be filed within 30 days from the date of the receipt of 
a copy of the decision of the Board by the party filing the motion.

                  Rule 30. Dismissal Without Prejudice

    In certain cases, appeals docketed before the Board are required to 
be placed in a suspense status and the Board is unable to proceed with 
disposition thereof for reasons not within the control of the Board. 
Where the suspension has continued, or may continue,

[[Page 476]]

for an inordinate length of time, the Board may, in its discretion, 
dismiss such appeals from its docket without prejudice to their 
restoration when the cause for suspension has been removed. Unless 
either party or the Board acts within three years, or such shorter time 
as ordered by the Board, to reinstate any appeal dismissed without 
prejudice, the dismissal shall be deemed with prejudice.

          Rule 31. Dismissal for Failure to Prosecute or Defend

    Whenever a record discloses the failure of either party to file 
documents required by these rules, respond to notices of correspondence 
from the Board, comply with orders of the Board or otherwise indicates 
an intention not to continue the prosecution of defense of an appeal, 
the Board may, in the case of a default by the appellant, issue an order 
to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed or, in the case of 
a default by the Government, issue an order to show cause why the Board 
should not act thereon pursuant to Rule 33. If good cause is not shown, 
the Board may take appropriate action.

                       Rule 32. Remand From Court

    Whenever any court remands a case to the Board for further 
proceedings, each of the parties shall, within 20 days of such remand, 
submit a report to the Board recommending procedures to be followed so 
as to comply with the court's order. The Board shall consider the 
reports and enter special orders governing the handling of the remanded 
case. To the extent the court's directive and tie limitations permit, 
such orders shall conform to these rules.

                           Rule 33. Sanctions

    If any party fails or refuses to obey an order issued by the Board, 
the Board may then make such order as it considers necessary to the just 
and expeditious conduct of the appeal.

                 Rule 34. Alternative Dispute Resolution

    Upon joint motion or with the consent of both parties, the Board may 
permit the use of methods of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). The 
Board shall notify parties of the availability of ADR methods by 
transmitting information with its notice of docketing (Rule 3).

 Rule 35. Application for Attorneys' Fees and Expenses Under the Equal 
                          Access to Justice Act

    The Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), 5 U.S.C. 504, allows payment 
of attorneys' fees and expenses to certain prevailing parties in 
administrative adjudications with the Government unless the Government's 
position was substantially justified. Rules governing applications for 
fees and expenses under EAJA can be found in 7 CFR 1.180 et seq.

discouraged workers (those capable of working but who have dropped out 
of the labor market--hence are not counted as unemployed), increase in 
unemployment rate, job loss, plant or military base closing, or other 
relevant unemployment indicators having a direct effect on the nominated

<R05>
Sec. 25.104  Poverty rate.

    (a) General. Eligibility of an area on the basis of poverty shall be 
established in accordance with the following poverty rate criteria 
specific to Round I and Round II nominated areas:
    (1) Round I--(i) In each Census tract, the poverty rate may not be 
less than 20 percent;
    (ii) For at least 90 percent of the Census tracts within the 
nominated area, the poverty rate may not be less than 25 percent; and
    (iii) For at least 50 percent of the Census tracts within the 
nominated area, the poverty rate may not be less than 35 percent.
    (2) Round II--(i) In each Census tract, the poverty rate may not be 
less than 20 percent;
    (ii) For at least 90 percent of the Census tracts within the 
nominated area, the poverty rate may not be less than 25 percent;
    (iii) Up to three noncontiguous developable sites, in the aggregate 
not exceeding 2,000 acres, may be excluded in determining whether the 
requirements of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section are 
met; and
    (iv) The Secretary may designate not more than one rural Empowerment 
Zone without regard to paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii) of this 
section if such nominated area satisfies the emigration criteria 
specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (b) Special rules. The following special rules apply to the 
determination of poverty rate for Round I and Round II nominated areas:
    (1) Round I--(i) Census tracts with no population. Census tracts 
with no population shall be treated as having a poverty rate that meets 
the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) of this section, 
but shall be treated as having a zero poverty rate for purposes of 
applying paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section;
    (ii) Census tracts with populations of less than 2,000. A Census 
tract with a population of less than 2,000 shall be treated as having a 
poverty rate which meets the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and 
(ii) of this section if more than 75 percent of the tract is zoned for 
commercial or industrial use;
    (iii) Adjustment of poverty rates for Round I Enterprise 
Communities. For Round I Enterprise Communities only, the Secretary may, 
where necessary to carry out the purposes of this part, apply one of the 
following alternatives:
    (A) Reduce by 5 percentage points one of the following thresholds 
for not more than 10 percent of the Census tracts (or, if fewer, five 
Census tracts) in the nominated area:
    (1) The 20 percent threshold in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section;
    (2) The 25 percent threshold in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this 
section;
    (3) The 35 percent threshold in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this 
section; or
    (B) Reduce the 35 percent threshold in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this 
section by 10 percentage points for three Census tracts.
    (2) Round II--(i) Census tracts with no population. Census tracts 
with no population shall be treated the same as those Census tracts 
having a population of less than 2,000;
    (ii) Census tracts with populations of less than 2,000. A Census 
tract with a population of less than 2,000 shall be treated as having a 
poverty rate of not less than 25 percent if:

[[Page 482]]

    (A) More than 75 percent of such tract is zoned for commercial or 
industrial use; and
    (B) Such tract is contiguous to 1 or more other Census tracts which 
have a poverty rate of 25 percent or more, where such determination is 
made without applying Sec. 25.104(b)(2)(ii).
    (iii) Emigration criteria. For purposes of the discretion as may be

<R05>
Sec. 25.202  Strategic plan.

    (a) Principles of strategic plan. The strategic plan included in the 
application must be developed in accordance with the following four key 
principles:
    (1) Strategic vision for change, which identifies what the community 
will become and a strategic map for revitalization. The vision should 
build on assets and coordinate a response to community needs in a 
comprehensive fashion. It should also set goals and performance 
benchmarks for measuring progress and establish a framework for 
evaluating and adjusting the revitalization plan.
    (2) Community-based partnerships, involving the participation of all 
segments of the community, including the political and governmental 
leadership, community groups, local public health and social service 
departments and nonprofit groups providing similar services, 
environmental groups, local transportation planning entities, public and 
private schools, religious organizations, the private and nonprofit 
sectors, centers of learning, and other community institutions and 
individual citizens.
    (3) Economic opportunity, including job creation within the 
community and throughout the region, entrepreneurial initiatives, small 
business expansion, job training and other important services such as 
affordable childcare and transportation services that may enable 
residents to be employed in jobs that offer upward mobility.
    (4) Sustainable community development, to advance the creation of 
livable and vibrant communities through comprehensive approaches that 
coordinate economic, physical, environmental, community, and human 
development. These approaches should preserve the environment and 
historic landmarks--they may include ``brownfields'' clean-up and 
redevelopment, and promote transportation, education, and public safety.
    (b) Minimum requirements. The strategic plan must:
    (1) Describe the coordinated economic, human, community, and 
physical development plan and related activities proposed for the 
nominated area;
    (2) Describe the process by which the affected community is a full 
partner in the process of developing and implementing the plan and the 
extent to which local institutions and organizations have contributed to 
the planning process;
    (3) Identify the amount of State, local, and private resources that 
will be available in the nominated area and the private and public 
partnerships to be used, which may include participation by, and 
cooperation with, universities, medical centers, and other private and 
public entities;
    (4) Identify the funding requested under any Federal program in 
support of the proposed economic, human, community, and physical 
development and related activities, including details about proposed 
uses of EZ/EC SSBG funds that may be available from HHS;

[[Page 484]]

    (5) Identify the baselines, methods, and benchmarks for measuring 
the success of carrying out the strategic plan, including the extent to 
which poor persons and families will be empowered to become economically 
self-sufficient;
    (6) Must not include any action to assist any establishment in 
relocating from one area outside the nominated area to the nominated 
area, except that assistance for the expansion of an existing business 
entity through the establishment of a new branch, affiliate, or 
subsidiary is permitted if:
    (i) The establishment of the new branch, affiliate, or subsidiary 
will not result in a decrease in employment in the area of original 
location or in any other area where the existing business entity 
conducts business operations; and
    (ii) There is no reason to believe that the new branch, affiliate, 
or subsidiary is being established with the intention of closing down 
the operations of the existing business entity in the area of its 
original location or in any other area where the existing business 
entity conducts business operation; and
    (7) Include such other information as required by USDA in the Notice 
Inviting Applications.
    (c) Implementation of strategic plan. The strategic plan may be 
implemented by State governments, tribal governments, local governments, 
regional planning agencies, non-profit organizations, community-based 
organizations, or other nongovernmental entities. Activities included in 
the strategic plan may be funded from any source, Federal, State, local, 
or private, which agrees to provide assistance to the nominated area.
    (d) Public access to materials and proceedings. The applicant or the 
lead managing entity, as applicable, must make available to the public 
copies of the strategic plan and supporting documentation and must 
conduct its meetings in accordance with the applicable open meetings 
acts.


<R05>
Sec. 25.203  Submission of applications.

    General. A separate application for designation as an Empowerment 
Zone or Enterprise Community must be submitted for each rural area for 
which such designation is requested. The application shall be submitted

additional information pertaining to the plan and the proposed area and 
may, as part of that request, suggest modifications to the plan, 
proposed area, or term that would enhance its effectiveness. The 
effectiveness of the strategic plan will be determined in accordance 
with the four key principles contained in Sec. 25.202(a). USDA will
