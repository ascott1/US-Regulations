                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 2005), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

Sec. 12.23  Administrative forfeiture proceedings.

    (a) When authorized. Whenever any property subject to forfeiture 
under the Eagle Protection Act, 16 U.S.C. 668 et seq., or Airborne 
Hunting Act, 16 U.S.C. 742j-1, or any wildlife or plant subject to

12.12 to have a value not greater than $100,000, the Solicitor may 
obtain forfeiture of such property in accordance with this section.
    (b) Procedure--(1) Notice of proposed forfeiture. As soon as 
practicable following seizure, the Solicitor shall issue a notice of 
proposed forfeiture.
    (A) Publication. The notice shall be published once a week for at 
least three successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in 
the locality where the property was seized. If the value of the seized 
property as determined under Sec. 12.12 does not exceed $1000, the 
notice may be published by posting, instead of newspaper publication, 
for at least three successive weeks in a conspicuous place accessible to 
the public at the Service's enforcement office, the U.S. District Court 
or the U.S. Customhouse nearest the place of seizure. In cases of 
posting, the date of initial posting shall be indicated on the notice. 
In addition to newspaper publication or posting, a reasonable effort 
shall be made to serve the notice personally or by registered or 
certified mail, return receipt requested, on each person whose 
whereabouts and interest in the seized property are known or easily 
ascertainable.
    (B) Contents. The notice shall be in substantially the same form as 
a complaint for forfeiture filed in United States District Court. The 
notice shall describe the property, including, in the case of motor 
vehicles, the license, registration, motor, and serial numbers. The 
notice shall state the time and

[[Page 34]]

place of seizure, as well as the reason therefor, and shall specify the 
value of the property as determined under Sec. 12.12. The notice shall 
contain a specific reference to the provisions of the laws or 
regulations allegedly violated and under which the property is subject 
to forfeiture. The notice shall state that any person desiring to claim 
the property must file a claim and a bond in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, and shall state that if a proper claim and bond 
are not received by the proper office within the time prescribed by such 
paragraph, the property will be declared forfeited to the United States 
and disposed of according to law. The notice shall also advise 
interested persons of their right to file a petition for remission of 
forfeiture in accordance with Sec. 12.24.
    (2) Filing a claim and bond. Upon issuance of the notice of proposed 
forfeiture, any person claiming the seized property may file with the 
Solicitor's office indicated in the notice a claim to the property and a 
bond in the penal sum of $5,000, or ten per centum of the value of the 
claimed property, whichever is lower, but not less than $250. Any claim 
and bond must be received in such office within 30 days after the date 
of first publication or posting of the notice of proposed forfeiture. 
The claim shall state the claimant's interest in the property. The bond 
filed with the claim shall be on a United States Customs Form 4615 or on 
a similar form provided by the Department. There shall be endorsed on 
the bond a list or schedule in substantially the following form which 
shall be signed by the claimant in the presence of the witnesses to the 
bond, and attested by the witnesses:

    List or schedule containing a particular description of seized 
article, claim for which is covered by the within bond, to wit:
________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________
    The foregoing list is correct.

Claimant --------------------
    Attest: --------------------


The claim and bond referred to in this paragraph shall not entitle the 
claimant or any other person to possession of the property.
    (3) Transmittal to Attorney General. As soon as practicable after 
timely receipt by the proper office of a proper claim and bond in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Solicitor shall 
transmit such claim and bond to the Attorney General for institution of 
forfeiture proceedings in U.S. District Court.
    (4) Motion for stay. Upon issuance of the notice of proposed 
forfeiture, any person claiming the seized property may file with the 
Solicitor's regional or field office indicated in the notice a motion to 
stay administrative forfeiture proceedings. Any motion for stay must be 
filed within 30 days after the date of first publication or posting of 
the notice of the proposed forfeiture. Each motion must contain:
    (i) The claimant's verified statement showing that he or she holds 
absolute, fee simple title to the seized property, free and clear of all 
liens, encumbrances, security interests, or other third-party interests, 
contingent or vested; and (ii) the claimant's offer to pay in advance 
all reasonable costs anticipated to be incurred in the storage, care, 
and maintenance of the seized property for which administrative 
forfeiture is sought. Where a stay of administrative forfeiture 
proceedings would not injure or impair the rights of any third parties 
and where the claimant has agreed to pay in advance anticipated, 
reasonable storage costs associated with the granting of a stay, the 
Regional or Field Solicitor as appropriate may, in his discretion, grant 
the motion for stay and specify reasonable and prudent conditions 
therefor, including but not limited to the duration of the stay, a 
description of the factors which would automatically terminate the stay, 
and any requirement for a bond (including amount) to secure the payment 
of storage and other maintenance costs. If a motion for stay is denied, 
or if a stay is terminated for any reason, the claimant must file, if he 
or she has not already done so, a claim and bond in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section not later than 30 days after receipt of 
the Solicitor's Office denial or termination order. Failure to file the 
claim and bond within 30 days will result in summary foreiture under 
paragraph (c) of this section.

[[Page 35]]

    (c) Summary forfeiture. If a proper claim and bond are not received 
by the proper office within 30 days as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section, the Solicitor shall declare the property forfeited. The 
declaration of forfeiture shall be in writing, and shall be sent by 
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the Service 
and to each person whose whereabouts and prior interest in the seized 
property are known or easily ascertainable. The declaration shall be in 
substantially the same form as a default judgment of forfeiture entered 
in United States District Court. The declaration shall describe the 
property and state the time, place, and reason for its seizure. The 
declaration shall identify the notice of proposed forfeiture, describing 
the dates and manner of publication of the notice and any efforts made 
to serve the notice personally or by mail. The declaration shall state 
that in response to the notice a proper claim and bond were not timely 
received by the proper office from any claimant, and that therefore all 
potential claimants are deemed to admit the truth of the allegations of 
the notice. The declaration shall conclude with an order of condemnation

have been brought in U.S. District Court, the Attorney General, a 
petition for remission of forfeiture.
    (b) A petition filed with the Solicitor need not be in any

property and must contain the following:
    (1) A description of the property;
    (2) The time and place of seizure;

such terms and conditions as may be reasonable and just or may order 
discontinuance of any proceeding under Sec. 12.23
    (g) If the Solicitor decides that relief should not be granted, the 
Solicitor shall so notify the petitioner in writing, stating in the

<R05>
Sec. 13.1  General.

    Each person intending to engage in an activity for which a permit is 
required by this subchapter B shall, before commencing such activity, 
obtain a valid permit authorizing such activity. Each person who desires 
to obtain the permit privileges authorized by this subchapter must make 
application for such permit in accordance with the requirements of this 
part 13 and the other regulations in this subchapter which set forth the 
additional requirements for the specific permits desired. If the 
activity for which permission is sought is covered by the requirements 
of more than one part of this subchapter, the requirements of each part 
must be met. If the information required for each specific permitted 
activity is included, one application will be accepted for all permits 
required, and a single permit will be issued.


<R05>
Sec. 13.2  Purpose of regulations.

    The regulations contained in this part provide uniform rules, 
conditions, and procedures for the application for and the issuance, 
denial, suspension, revocation, and general administration of all 
permits issued pursuant to this subchapter B.

(part 15), ``Injurious Wildlife'' (part 16), ``Endangered and Threatened 
Wildlife and Plants'' (part 17), ``Marine Mammals'' (part 18), 
``Migratory Bird Permits'' (part 21), ``Eagle Permits'' (part 22), and

certificate, letter of authorization, or other document as the context 
may require, and to all such documents issued by the Service or other 
authorized U.S. or foreign government agencies.

Sec. 13.4  Emergency variation from requirements.

    The Director may approve variations from the requirements of this 
part when he finds that an emergency exists and that the proposed 
variations will not hinder effective administration of this subchapter 
B, and will not be unlawful.


<R05>
Sec. 13.5  Information collection requirements.

    (a) The Office of Management and Budget approved the information 
collection requirements contained in this part 13 under 44 U.S.C. and 
assigned OMB Control Number 1018-0092. The Service may not conduct or 
sponsor, and you are not required to respond, to a collection of 
information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. We 
are collecting this information to provide information necessary to 
evaluate permit applications. We will use this information to review 
permit applications and make decisions, according to criteria 
established in various Federal wildlife conservation statutes and 
regulations, on the issuance, suspension, revocation, or denial permits. 
You must respond to obtain or retain a permit.
    (b) We estimate the public reporting burden for these reporting 
requirements to vary from 15 minutes to 4 hours per response, with an 
average of 0.803 hours per response, including time for reviewing 
instructions, gathering and maintaining data, and completing

[[Page 42]]

and reviewing the forms. Direct comments regarding the burden estimate 
or any other aspect of these reporting requirements to the Service 
Information Collection Control Officer, MS-222 ARLSQ, U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, Washington, DC 20240, or the Office of Management and 
Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (1018-0092), Washington, DC 20603.

    (a) Forms. Applications must be submitted in writing on a Federal 
Fish and Wildlife License/Permit Application (Form 3-200) or as 
otherwise specifically directed by the Service.
    (b) Forwarding Instructions. Applications for permits in the 
following categories should be forwarded to the issuing office indicated 
below.
    (1) You may obtain applications for migratory bird banding permits 
(50 CFR 21.22) by writing to: Bird Banding Laboratory, USGS Patuxent 
Wildlife Research Center, 12100 Beech Forest Road, Laurel, Maryland 
20708-4037. Submit completed permit applications to the same address.
    (2) You may obtain applications for designated port exception 
permits and import/export licenses (50 CFR 14) by writing to the Special 
Agent in Charge (SAC) of the Region in which you reside (see 50 CFR 2.2 
or the Service Web site, http://www.fws.gov, for addresses and 
boundaries of the Regions). Submit completed permit applications to the 
same address.
    (3) You may obtain applications for Wild Bird Conservation Act 
permits (50 CFR 15); injurious wildlife permits (50 CFR 16); captive-
bred wildlife registrations (50 CFR 17); permits authorizing import, 
export, or foreign commerce of endangered and threatened species, and 
interstate commerce of non-native endangered or threatened species (50 
CFR 17); marine mammal permits (50 CFR 18); and permits and certificates 
for import, export, and reexport of species listed under the Convention 
on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora 
(CITES) (50 CFR 23) from: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Division of 
Management Authority, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, Room 700, Arlington,

address.
    (4) You may obtain Endangered Species Act permit applications (50 
CFR 17) for activities involving native endangered and threatened 
species, including incidental take, scientific purposes, enhancement of 
propagation or survival (i.e., recovery), and enhancement of survival by 
writing to the Regional Director (Attention: Endangered Species Permits) 
of the Region where the activity is to take place (see 50 CFR 2.2 or the 
Service Web site, http://www.fws.gov, for addresses and boundaries of 
the Regions). Submit completed applications to the same address (the 
Regional office covering the area where the activity will take place). 
Permit applications for interstate commerce for native endangered and 
threatened species should be obtained by writing to the Regional 
Director (Attention: Endangered Species Permits) of the Region that has 
the lead for the particular species, rather than the Region where the 
activity will take place. You can obtain information on the lead Region 
via the Service's Endangered Species Program Web page (http://
endangered.fws.gov/wildlife.html) by entering the common or scientific 
name of the listed species in the Regulatory Profile query box. Send 
interstate commerce permit applications for native listed species to the 
same Regional Office that has the lead for that species. Endangered 
Species Act permit applications for the import or export of native 
endangered and threatened species may be obtained from the Division of 
Management Authority in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section.
    (5) You may obtain applications for bald and golden eagle permits 
(50 CFR 22) and migratory bird permits (50 CFR 21), except for banding

Region 7 (AK): U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Migratory Bird Permit 
    Office (MS-201), 1011 E. Tudor Road, Anchorage, AK 99503.

    (c) Time notice. The Service will process all applications as 
quickly as possible. However, we cannot guarantee final action within 
the time limit you request. You should ensure that applications for 
permits for marine mammals and/or endangered and threatened species are 
postmarked at least 90 calendar days prior to the requested effective 
date. The time we require for processing of endangered and threatened 
species incidental take permits will vary according to the project scope 
and significance of effects. Submit applications for all other permits 
to the issuing/reviewing office and ensure they are postmarked at least 
60 calendar days prior to the requested effective date. Our processing 
time may be increased by the procedural requirements of the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the requirement to publish a notice in 
the Federal Register requesting a 30-day public comment period when we 
receive certain types of permit applications, and/or the time required 
for extensive consultation within the Service, with other Federal 
agencies, and/or State or foreign governments. When applicable, we may 
require permit applicants to provide additional information on the 
proposal and on its environmental effects as may be necessary to satisfy 
the procedural requirements of NEPA.
    (d) Fees. (1) Unless otherwise exempted under this subsection, you 
must pay the required permit processing fee at the time that you apply 
for issuance or amendment of a permit. You must pay by check or money 
order made payable to the ``U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.'' The 
Service will not refund any application fee under any circumstances if 
we have processed the application. However, we may return the 
application fee if you withdraw the application before we have 
significantly processed it.
    (2) If regulations in this subchapter require more than one type of 
permit for an activity and the permits are issued by the same office, 
the issuing office may issue one consolidated permit authorizing the 
activity in accordance with Sec. 13.1. You may submit a single 
application in such cases, provided that the single application contains 
all the information required by the separate applications for each 
permitted activity. Where more than one permitted activity is 
consolidated into one permit, the issuing office will charge the highest 
single fee for the activity permitted.
    (3) Circumstances under which we will not charge a permit 
application fee are as follows:
    (i) We will not charge a permit application fee to any Federal, 
tribal, State, or local government agency or to any individual or 
institution acting on behalf of such agency. Except as otherwise 
authorized or waived, if you fail to submit evidence of such status with 
your application, we will require the submission of all processing fees 
prior to the acceptance of the application for processing.

[[Page 44]]

    (ii) As noted in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
    (iii) We may waive the fee on a case-by-case basis for extraordinary 
extenuating circumstances provided that the issuing permit office and a 
Regional or Assistant Director approves the waiver.
    (4) User fees. The following table identifies specific fees for each 
permit application or amendment to a current permit. If no fee is 
identified under the Amendment Fee column, this particular permit either 
cannot be amended and a new application, and application fee, would need 
to be submitted or no fee will be charged for amending the permit 
(please contact the issuing office for further information).

    (5) We will charge a fee for substantive amendments made to permits 
within the time period that the permit is still valid. The fee is 
generally half the original fee assessed at the time that the permit is 
processed; see paragraph (d)(4) of this section for the exact amount. 
Substantive amendments are those that pertain to the purpose and 
conditions of the permit and are not purely administrative. 
Administrative changes, such as updating name and address information, 
are required under 13.23(c), and we will not charge a fee for such 
amendments.
    (6) Except as specifically noted in paragraph (d)(4) of this 
section, a permit renewal is an issuance of a new permit, and applicants 
for permit renewal must pay the appropriate fee listed in paragraph 
(d)(4) of this section.
    (e) Abandoned or incomplete applications. If we receive an 
incomplete or improperly executed application, or if you do not submit 
the proper fees, the issuing office will notify you of the deficiency. 
If you fail to supply the correct information to complete the 
application or to pay the required fees within 45 calendar days of the 
date of notification, we will consider the application abandoned. We 
will not refund any fees for an abandoned application.

                     Subpart C_Permit Administration


<R05>
Sec. 13.21  Issuance of permits.

    (a) No permit may be issued prior to the receipt of a written 
application therefor, unless a written variation from the requirements, 
as authorized by Sec. 13.4, is inserted into the official file of the 
Bureau. An oral or written representation of an employee or agent of the 
United States Government, or an action of such employee or agent, shall 
not be construed as a permit unless it meets the requirements of a 
permit as defined in 50 CFR 10.12.
    (b) Upon receipt of a properly executed application for a permit, 
the Director shall issue the appropriate permit unless:
    (1) The applicant has been assessed a civil penalty or convicted of 
any criminal provision of any statute or regulation relating to the 
activity for which the application is filed, if such assessment or 
conviction evidences a lack of responsibility.
    (2) The applicant has failed to disclose material information 
required, or has made false statements as to any material fact, in 
connection with his application;

[[Page 47]]

    (3) The applicant has failed to demonstrate a valid justification 
for the permit and a showing of responsibility;
    (4) The authorization requested potentially threatens a wildlife or 
plant population, or
    (5) The Director finds through further inquiry or investigation, or 
otherwise, that the applicant is not qualified.
    (c) Disqualifying factors. Any one of the following will disqualify 
a person from receiving permits issued under this part.
    (1) A conviction, or entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, 
for a felony violation of the Lacey Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, 
or the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act disqualifies any such person 
from receiving or exercising the privileges of a permit, unless such 
disqualification has been expressly waived by the Director in response 
to a written petition.
    (2) The revocation of a permit for reasons found in Sec. 13.28 
(a)(1) or (a)(2) disqualifies any such person from receiving or 
exercising the privileges of a similar permit for a period of five years 
from the date of the final agency decision on such revocation.
    (3) The failure to pay any required fees or assessed costs and 
penalties, whether or not reduced to judgement disqualifies such person 
from receiving or exercising the privileges of a permit as long as such 
moneys are owed to the United States. This requirement shall not apply 
to any civil penalty presently subject to administrative or judicial 
appeal; provided that the pendency of a collection action brought by the 
United States or its assignees shall not constitute an appeal within the 
meaning of this subsection.
    (4) The failure to submit timely, accurate, or valid reports as 
required may disqualify such person from receiving or exercising the 
privileges of a permit as long as the deficiency exists.
    (d) Use of supplemental information. The issuing officer, in making 
a determination under this subsection, may use any information available 
that is relevant to the issue. This may include any prior conviction, or 
entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, or assessment of civil or 
criminal penalty for a violation of any Federal or State law or 
regulation governing the permitted activity. It may also include any 
prior permit revocations or suspensions, or any reports of State or 
local officials. The issuing officer shall consider all relevant facts 
or information available, and may make independent inquiry or 
investigation to verify information or substantiate qualifications 
asserted by the applicant.
    (e) Conditions of issuance and acceptance. (1) Conditions of 
issuance and acceptance. Any permit automatically incorporates within 
its terms the conditions and requirements of subpart D of this part and 
of any part(s) or section(s) specifically authorizing or governing the 
activity for which the permit is issued, as well as any other conditions 
deemed appropriate and included on the face of the permit at the 
discretion of the Director.
    (2) Any person accepting and holding a permit under this subchapter 
B acknowledges the necessity for close regulation and monitoring of the 
permitted activity by the Government. By accepting such permit, the 
permittee consents to and shall allow entry by agents or employees of 
the Service upon premises where the permitted activity is conducted at 
any reasonable hour. Service agents or employees may enter such premises 
to inspect the location; any books, records, or permits required to be 
kept by this subchapter B; and any wildlife or plants kept under 
authority of the permit.
    (f) Term of permit. Unless otherwise modified, a permit is valid 
during the period specified on the face of the permit. Such period shall 
include the effective date and the date of expiration.

Sec. 13.27  Permit suspension.

    (a) Criteria for suspension. The privileges of exercising some or 
all of the permit authority may be suspended at any time if the 
permittee is not in compliance with the conditions of the permit, or 
with any applicable laws or regulations governing the conduct of the 
permitted activity. The issuing officer may also suspend all or part of

fees, penalties or costs owed to the Government. Such suspension shall 
remain in effect until the issuing officer determines that the permittee 
has corrected the deficiencies.
    (b) Procedure for suspension. (1) When the issuing officer believes 
there are valid grounds for suspending a permit the permittee shall be 
notified in writing of the proposed suspension by certified or 
registered mail. This notice shall identify the permit to be suspended, 
the reason(s) for such suspension, the actions necessary to correct the 
deficiencies, and inform the permittee of the right to object to the 
proposed suspension. The issuing officer may amend any notice of 
suspension at any time.

following reasons:
    (1) The permittee willfully violates any Federal or State statute or

regulation of any foreign country, which involves a violation of the 
conditions of the permit or of the laws or regulations governing the 
permitted activity; or
    (2) The permittee fails within 60 days to correct deficiencies that 
were the cause of a permit suspension; or
    (3) The permittee becomes disqualified under Sec. 13.21(c) of this

Sec. 17.32(b) through (d) of this subchapter, the population(s) of the 
wildlife or plant that is the subject of the permit declines to the 
extent that continuation of the permitted activity would be detrimental 
to maintenance or recovery of the affected population.
    (b) Procedure for revocation. (1) When the issuing officer believes 
there are valid grounds for revoking a permit, the permittee shall be 
notified in writing of the proposed revocation by certified or 
registered mail. This notice shall identify the permit to be revoked, 
the reason(s) for such revocation, the proposed disposition of the 
wildlife, if any, and inform the permittee of the right to object to the 
proposed revocation. The issuing officer may amend any notice of 
revocation at any time.
    (2) Upon receipt of a notice of proposed revocation the permittee 
may file a written objection to the proposed action. Such objection must 
be in writing, must be filed within 45 calendar days of the date of the 
notice of proposal, must state the reasons why the permittee objects to 
the proposed revocation, and may include supporting documentation.
    (3) A decision on the revocation shall be made within 45 days after 
the end of the objection period. The issuing officer shall notify the 
permittee in writing of the Service's decision and the reasons 
therefore, together with the information concerning the right to request 
and the procedures for requesting reconsideration.
    (4) Unless a permittee files a timely request for reconsideration, 
any wildlife held under authority of a permit that is revoked must be 
disposed of in accordance with instructions of the issuing officer. If a 
permittee files a timely request for reconsideration of a proposed 
revocation, such permittee may retain possession of any wildlife held 
under authority of the permit until final disposition of the appeal 
process.

Sec. 14.3  Information collection requirements.

    The Office of Management and Budget approved the information 
collection requirements contained in this part 14 under 44 U.S.C. 3507 
and assigned OMB Control Number 1018-0092. The Service may not conduct 
or sponsor, and you are not required to respond, to a collection of 
information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. We 
are collecting this information to provide information about wildlife 
imports or exports, including product and parts, and to facilitate 
enforcement of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 as amended (16 U.S.C. 
1531 et seq.) and to carry out the provisions of the convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. We 
estimate the public reporting burden for these reporting requirements to 
vary from 10 to 15 minutes per response. Direct comments regarding the 
burden estimate or any other aspect of these reporting requirements to 
the Service Information Collection Control Officer, MS-222 ARLSQ, U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington, DC 20240, or the Office of 
Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (1018-0092),

the importer or consignee, or exporter, if known or easily 
ascertainable. Such notice must describe the detained wildlife or other 
property, indicate the reason for the detention, describe the general 
nature of the tests or inquiries to be conducted, and indicate that if 
the releasability of the wildlife has not been determined within 30 days 
after the date of the notice, or a longer period if specifically stated, 
that the Service will deem the wildlife to be seized and will issue no

may refuse clearance of imported wildlife when there are responsible 
grounds to believe that:
    (1) A Federal law or regulation has been violated;
    (2) The correct identity and country of origin of the wildlife has 
not been established (in such cases, the burden is upon the owner, 
importer, exporter, consignor, or consignee to establish such identity 
by scientific name to the species level or, if any subspecies is 
protected by the laws of this country or the country of origin to the 
subspecies level);
    (3) Any permit, license, or other documentation required for 
clearance of such wildlife is not available, is not currently valid, has 
been suspended or revoked, or is not authentic;
    (4) The importer, exporter, or the importer's or exporter's agent 
has filed an incorrect or incomplete declaration for importation or 
exportation as provided in Sec. 14.61 or Sec. 14.63; or
    (5) The importer, exporter, or the importer's or exporter's agent 
has not paid any fee or portion of balance due for inspection fees 
required by Sec. 14.93 or Sec. 14.94, or penalties assessed against 
the importer or exporter under 50 CFR part 11. This paragraph does not 
apply to penalty assessments on appeal in accordance with the provisions 
of part 11.

<R05>
Sec. 14.81  Marking requirement.

    Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, no person may import, 
export, or transport in interstate commerce any container or package 
containing any fish or wildlife (including shellfish and fishery 
products) unless he/she marks each container or package conspicuously on 
the outside with both the name and address of the shipper and consignee. 
An accurate and legible list of its contents by species scientific name 
and the number of each species and whether or not the listed species are 
venomous must accompany the entire shipment.

[61 FR 31870, June 21, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 14.82  Alternatives and exceptions to the marking requirement.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 14.81 may be met by complying with one 
of the following alternatives to the marking requirement:
    (1)(i) Conspicuously marking the outside of each container or 
package containing fish or wildlife with the word ``fish'' or 
``wildlife'' as appropriate for its contents, or with the common name of 
its contents by species, and
    (ii) Including an invoice, packing list, bill of lading, or similar 
document to accompany the shipment which accurately states the name and 
address of the shipper and consignee, states the total number of 
packages or containers in the shipment, and for each species in the 
shipment specifies:
    (A) The common name that identifies the species (examples include: 
Chinook (or king) salmon; bluefin tuna; and whitetail deer) and whether 
or not the listed species is venomous; and
    (B) The number of that species (or other appropriate measure of 
quantity such as gross or net weight).

The invoice, packing list, bill of lading, or equivalent document must 
be securely attached to the outside of one container or package in the 
shipment or otherwise physically accompany the shipment in a manner 
which makes it readily accessible for inspection; or
    (2) Affixing the shipper's wildlife import/export license number 
preceded by the three letters ``FWS'' on the outside of each container 
or package containing fish or wildlife, if the shipper has valid 
wildlife import/export license issued under authority of 50 CFR part 14. 
For each shipment marked in accordance with this paragraph, the records 
maintained under Sec. 14.93(c) must include a copy of the invoice, 
packing list, bill of lading, or other similar document that accurately 
states the information required by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (3) In the case of subcontainers or packages within a larger packing 
container, only the outermost container must be marked in accordance 
with this section. Except, that for live fish or wildlife that are 
packed in subcontainers within a larger packing container, if the 
subcontainers are numbered or labeled, the packing list, invoice, bill 
or lading, or other similar document, must reflect that number or label. 
However, each subcontainer containing a venomous species must be clearly 
marked as venomous.
    (4) A conveyance (truck, plane, boat, etc.) is not considered a 
container for purposes of requiring specific marking of the conveyance 
itself, provided that:
    (i) The fish or wildlife within the conveyance is carried loosely or 
is readily identifiable, and is accompanied by the document required by 
paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, or
    (ii) The fish or wildlife is otherwise packaged and marked in 
accordance with this subpart.
    (b) The requirements of Sec. 14.81 do not apply to containers or 
packages containing--
    (1) Fox, nutria, rabbit, mink, chinchilla, marten, fisher, muskrat, 
and karakul that have been bred and born in captivity, or their 
products, if a signed statement certifying that the animals were bred 
and born in captivity accompanies the shipping documents;
    (2) Fish or shellfish contained in retail consumer packages labeled 
pursuant to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.; or
    (3) Fish or shellfish that are landed by, and offloaded from, a 
fishing vessel (whether or not the catch has been carried by the fishing 
vessel interstate), as

[[Page 65]]

long as the fish or shellfish remain at the place where first offloaded.

<R05>
Sec. 14.94  What fees apply to me?

    (a) License and inspection fees. We will impose a yearly fee for a 
license pursuant to Sec. 14.93. In addition, you must pay an inspection 
fee for each wildlife shipment imported into or exported from the United 
States at a designated port. If you import into or export from the 
United States wildlife shipments meeting the criteria outlined in 
paragraph (e) of this section, you are exempt from the designated port 
inspection fee, or nondesignated port administrative fee and hourly 
minimums, whichever apply. However, you must pay applicable overtime 
fees and permit fees.
    (b) Designated port overtime fees. The Service may charge importers 
or exporters of wildlife, regardless of being licensed as a commercial 
importer or exporter, a fee for overtime for inspections that begin 
before normal working hours, that extend beyond normal working hours, or 
are on a holiday, Saturday, or Sunday if the importer/exporter requested 
that the inspection be performed outside normal work hours. Overtime 
fees consist of an increased hourly rate equal to 1\1/2\ times the 
average hourly rate of a journeyman level wildlife inspector. Overtime 
fees will be in addition to inspection fees imposed for license holders 
at designated ports. If an importer/exporter presents a shipment for 
inspection during normal work hours but the Service cannot perform the 
inspection during normal work hours on that day, the service will give 
the importer/exporter the option of performing the inspection later 
during normal work hours or charging for overtime. The Service's ability 
to perform inspections during overtime hours will depend on the 
availability of Service personnel. The Service will use the following 
parameters when calculating the overtime fee:
    (1) Inspection overtime commences when a Service officer departs 
that officer's residence or official duty station enroute to the 
inspection site or at the end of normal work hours. Inspection overtime 
terminates when the officer returns to the point of departure or 
official duty station or when the inspection is completed, whichever 
occurs later.
    (2) For an inspection at a designated port beginning less than 1 
hour before normal work hours, the Service will charge 1 hour of time, 
at an hourly rate of 1\1/2\ times the average hourly rate of a 
journeyman level Wildlife Inspector. For all other overtime inspections 
at a designated port the Service will charge a minimum of 2 hours of 
time, at an hourly rate of 1\1/2\ times the average hourly rate of a 
journeyman level Wildlife Inspector, except that for all inspections 
performed on a federal holiday the Service will charge a minimum of 2 
hours at twice the average hourly rate of a journeyman level Wildlife 
Inspector.
    (3) The Service will charge any inspection time in excess of the 2-
hour minimum in quarter hour increments at the same hourly rate as the 
first 2 hours. The Service will round up inspection time of 10 minutes 
or more to the next quarter hour and will disregard any time less than 
10 minutes.

[[Page 68]]

    (4) The fee schedule will apply to all inspections regardless of 
importer/exporter of record, except, that the Service will charge 
multiple shipments consigned to the same importer/exporter and inspected 
at one location one 2-hour minimum or actual time, whichever is greater.
    (c) Nondesignated port fees. The Service will charge permittees 
issued permits under subpart C of this part, and licensed commercial 
importers and exporters a fee for inspections at nondesignated ports. 
The fees consist of a flat administrative fee plus a minimum of two 
hours of time at staffed nondesignated ports. The Service will use the 
following parameters when calculating fees:
    (1) During normal working hours the Service will charge permittees 
issued permits under subpart C of this part, regardless of being 
licensed as a commercial importer or exporter, an administrative fee 
plus a minimum of 2 hours of time at the average hourly rate of a 
journeyman level wildlife inspector. The Service will charge permittees 
requesting clearance outside normal working hours, including Saturday 
and Sunday, an administrative fee plus a minimum of 2 hours of time at 
1\1/2\ times the average hourly rate of a journeyman level wildlife 
inspector, except that for all inspections performed on a federal 
holiday the Service will charge a minimum of 2 hours at twice the 
average hourly rate of a journeyman level wildlife inspector.
    (2) The Service will charge any inspection time in excess of the 2-
hour minimum in quarter hour increments at the same hourly rate as the 
first 2 hours. The Service will round up inspection time of 10 minutes 
or more to the next quarter hour and will disregard any time less than 
10 minutes.
    (3) The Service will not charge importers or exporters who are not 
required to have a permit under subpart C of this part, except that the 
Service will charge licensed importers or exporters an administrative 
fee only during normal working hours, and overtime hourly rates and 
minimums will apply outside normal working hours.
    (4) For inspections performed under a permit issued under subpart C 
of this part at nondesignated ports with no permanent Service law 
enforcement staff, the Service will charge all costs associated with 
inspection and clearance, including, salary, travel and transportation 
costs, and per diem.

<R05>
Sec. 14.105  Consignment to carrier.

    (a) No carrier shall accept any live wild mammal or bird for 
transport to the United States that has not been examined within 10 days 
prior to commencement of transport to the United

[[Page 71]]

States by a veterinarian certified as qualified by the national 
government of the initial country from which the mammal or bird is being 
exported. If the national government of such country does not certify 
veterinarians, then the veterinarian must be certified or licensed by a 
local government authority designated by the national government as 
authorized to certify veterinarians.
    (b)(1) A certificate of veterinary medical inspection, signed by the 
examining veterinarian, stating that the animal has been examined, is 
healthy, appears to be free of any communicable disease, and is able to 
withstand the normal rigors of transport must accompany the mammal or 
bird; the certificate should include the veterinarian's license number, 
certification number, or equivalent. A mammal in the last third of its 
pregnancy, if this is detectable using professionally accepted 
standards, shall not be accepted for transport to the United States 
except for medical treatment and unless the examining veterinarian 
certifies in writing that the animal has been examined, the state of 
pregnancy has been evaluated, and that, despite the medical condition 
requiring treatment, the animal is physically able to withstand the 
normal rigors of transportation to the United States.
    (2) A nursing mother with young, an unweaned mammal unaccompanied by 
its mother, or an unweaned bird shall be transported only if the primary 
purpose is for needed medical treatment and upon certification in 
writing by the examining veterinarian that the treatment is necessary 
and the animal is able to withstand the normal rigors of transport. Such 
an unweaned mammal or bird shall not be transported to the United States 
for medical treatment unless it is accompanied at all times by and 
completely accessible to a veterinary attendant.
    (c) A sick or injured wild mammal or bird shall be permitted 
transport to the United States only if the primary purpose of such 
transport is for needed medical treatment and upon certification in 
writing by the examining veterinarian that the treatment is necessary 
and the animal is able to withstand the normal rigors of travel in its 
present condition. A sick or injured animal shall be accompanied at all 
times throughout the transport process by a veterinary attendant 
qualified to care for and treat it, with continuous access to the 
animal. This individual shall be in possession of or have ready access 
to all medications to be administered during the transport.
    (d) No carrier shall accept any wild mammal or bird for transport to 
the United States presented by the shipper less than 2 hours or more 
than 6 hours prior to the scheduled departure of the conveyance on which 
it is to be transported. The carrier shall notify the crew of the 
presence of live animal shipments.


<R05>
Sec. 14.106  Primary enclosures.

    No carrier shall accept for transport to the United States any live 
wild mammal or bird in a primary enclosure that does not conform to the 
following requirements:
    (a) The Container Requirements of the Live Animal Regulations (LAR), 
20th edition, October 1, 1993, published by the International Air 
Transport Association (IATA) shall be complied with by all parties 
transporting wild mammals or birds to the United States. The 
incorporation by reference of the LAR was approved by the Director of 
the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 
51. Copies may be obtained from IATA, 2000 Peel St., Montreal, Quebec, 
Canada H3A 2R4. Copies may be inspected at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, 4401 N. Fairfax Dr., Arlington, VA 22203 or at the National 
Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the 
availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: 
http://www.archives.gov/federal--register/code--of--federal--
regulations/ibr--locations.html.
    (b) A primary enclosure shall be constructed so that--
    (1) The strength of the enclosure is sufficient to contain the 
mammal or bird and to withstand the normal effects of transport;
    (2) The interior of the enclosure is free from any protrusion that 
could be injurious to the mammal or bird within;

[[Page 72]]

    (3) No part of the animal can extend or protrude outside of the 
primary enclosure which may result in injury to the contained animal, to 
nearby persons or animals, or to handlers of the primary enclosure;
    (4) Access to the primary enclosure is closed and secured with an 
animal-proof device designed to prevent accidental opening and release 
of the mammal or bird;
    (5) The opening of the enclosure is easily accessible for either 
emergency removal or inspection of the mammal or bird by authorized 
personnel without the risk of escape of the mammal or bird;
    (6) The enclosure has sufficient openings to ensure adequate 
circulation of air at all times.
    (7) The material of which the primary enclosure is constructed is 
not treated with any paint, preservative, or other chemical that is 
injurious or otherwise harmful to the health or well-being of mammals 
and birds.
    (c) Unless the enclosure is permanently affixed in the conveyance or 
has an open top for certain large mammals, spacer bars allowing 
circulation of air around the enclosure shall be fitted to the exterior 
of its top, sides, and base. Spacer bars on an enclosure need extend no 
more than 6 inches (15 centimeters) from the surface of the enclosure. 
Within this 6 inch limit, the spacers on an enclosure containing one 
animal shall extend a distance equal to at least 10 percent of the 
longer dimension of the surface to which they are attached, and the 
spacers on an enclosure containing more than one animal shall extend a 
distance equal to at least 20 percent of the longer dimension of the 
surface to which they are attached. Hand-holds may serve as spacer bars 
for the sides of the enclosure to which they are attached. A primary 
enclosure constructed with one or more slanted or curved walls 
containing ventilation openings need not be fitted with spacer bars on 
such walls.
    (d) An enclosure that is not permanently affixed within the 
conveyance shall have adequate hand-holds or other devices for lifting 
by hand or to facilitate lifting and carrying by machine. Such hand-
holds or other devices shall be made an integral part of the enclosure, 
shall enable it to be lifted without excessive tipping, and shall be 
designed so that the person handling the enclosure will not come in 
contact with the animals contained therein.
    (e) An enclosure shall have a solid, leak-proof bottom or removable, 
leak-proof collection tray under a slatted or wire mesh floor. The 
slatted or wire mesh floor shall be designed and constructed so that the 
spaces between the slats or the holes in the mesh cannot trap the limbs 
of animals contained within the enclosure. An enclosure for mammals 
shall contain unused absorbent litter on the solid bottom or in the 
leak-proof tray in sufficient quantity to absorb and cover excreta. This 
litter shall be safe and nontoxic and shall not resemble food normally 
consumed by the mammals. An enclosure used to transport marine mammals 
in water, in a waterproof enclosure, a sling, or on foam is exempt from 
the requirement to contain litter. An enclosure used to transport birds 
shall not contain litter, unless it is specified in writing by the 
examining veterinarian as medically necessary.
    (f) If an enclosure has been previously used to transport or store 
wild mammals or birds, it shall have been cleaned and sanitized in a 
manner that will destroy pathogenic agents and pests injurious to the 
health of mammals and birds before the enclosure can be re-used.
    (g) An enclosure that is not permanently affixed in the conveyance 
shall be clearly marked in English on the outside of the top and one or 
more sides of the enclosure, in letters not less than 2.5 centimeters (1 
inch) in height, ``Live Animals'' or ``Wild Animals'', ``Do Not Tip,'' 
``Only Authorized Personnel May Open Container,'' and other appropriate 
or required instructions. All enclosure sides shall also be 
conspicuously marked on the outside with arrows to indicate the correct 
upright position of the enclosure. These arrows should extend up the 
sides of the enclosure so that the point of the arrow is visible and 
clearly indicates the top of the enclosure.
    (h) Food and water instructions as specified in Sec. 14.108, 
information regarding what constitutes obvious signs of

[[Page 73]]

stress in the species being transported, and information about any drugs 
or medication to be administered by the accompanying veterinary 
attendant shall be securely attached to each enclosure. Copies of 
shipping documents accompanying the shipment shall also be securely 
attached to the primary enclosure. Original documents shall be carried 
in the carrier's pouch or manifest container or by the shipper's 
attendant accompanying the wild mammal or bird.
    (i) Any food and water troughs shall be securely attached to the 
interior of the enclosure in such a manner that the troughs can be 
filled from outside the enclosure. Any opening providing access to a 
trough shall be capable of being securely closed with an animal-proof 
device. A water trough in an enclosure containing birds shall contain a 
foam or sponge insert, a perforated wooden block, or other suitable 
device to prevent spillage or drowning.
    (j) When a primary enclosure is permanently affixed within a 
conveyance so that its front opening is the only source of ventilation, 
the opening shall face the outside of the conveyance or an unobstructed 
aisle or passageway within the conveyance. Such an aisle or passageway 
shall be at least 12 inches (30 centimeters) wide. The opening in the 
primary enclosure shall occupy at least 90 percent of the total surface 
area of the front wall of the enclosure and be covered with bars or wire 
mesh.

<R05>
Sec. 14.107  Conveyance.

    (a) The animal cargo space of a conveyance used to transport wild 
mammals or birds to the United States shall be designed, constructed, 
and maintained so as to ensure the humane and healthful transport of the 
animals.
    (b) The cargo space shall be constructed and maintained so as to 
prevent the harmful ingress of engine exhaust fumes and gases produced 
by the conveyance.
    (c) No wild mammal or bird shall be placed in a cargo space of a 
conveyance that does not provide sufficient air for it to breathe 
normally. Primary enclosures shall be positioned in a cargo space in 
such a manner that each animal has access to sufficient air for normal 
breathing.
    (d) The interior of an animal cargo space shall be kept clean of 
disease-causing agents.
    (e) A wild mammal or bird shall not be transported in a cargo space 
that contains any material, substance, or device that may reasonably be 
expected to result in inhumane conditions or be injurious to the 
animal's health unless all reasonable precautions are taken to prevent 
such conditions or injury.


<R05>
Sec. 14.108  Food and water.

    (a) No carrier shall accept any wild mammal or bird for transport to 
the United States unless written instructions from the shipper 
concerning the animal's food and water requirements are securely affixed 
to the outside of its primary enclosure. Such instructions shall be 
consistent with professionally accepted standards of care and include 
specifically the quantity of water required, the amount and type of food 
required, and the frequency of feeding and watering necessary to ensure 
that the animal is transported humanely and healthfully.
    (b) A mammal or bird requiring drinking water shall have 
uncontaminated water suitable for drinking made available to it at all 
times prior to commencement of transport to the United States, during 
intermediate stopovers, and upon arrival in the United States, or as 
directed by the shipper's written instructions.
    (c) A mammal or bird that obtains moisture from fruits or other food 
shall be provided such food prior to commencement of transport to the 
United States, during stopovers, and upon arrival in the United States, 
or as directed by the shipper's written instructions.
    (d) During a stopover or while still in the custody of the carrier 
after arrival in the United States, a mammal or bird in transit shall be 
observed no less frequently than once every four hours and given food 
and water according to the instructions required by Sec. 14.108(a).
    (e) Suitable and sufficient food shall be made available during 
transport.

[[Page 74]]

    (f) Additional requirements for feeding and watering particular 
kinds of animals are found below in the specifications for the various 
groups.


<R05>
Sec. 14.109  Care in transit.

    (a) During transportation to the United States, including any 
stopovers during transport, the carrier shall visually inspect each 
primary enclosure not less than once every 4 hours, or in the case of 
air transport, every 4 hours whenever the cargo hold is accessible. 
During such inspections, the carrier shall verify that the ambient air 
temperature is within allowable limits (see Sec. 14.109(b)), that 
enclosures have not been damaged, that adequate ventilation is being 
provided, and when transport is by air, that air pressure suitable to 
support live animals is maintained within the cargo area (pressure 
equivalent to a maximum altitude of 8000 feet). During these 
observations the carrier shall also determine whether any animals are in 
obvious distress as described in documents attached to the enclosure. 
The absence of such a document or the absence of information as to signs 
of distress shall not remove this responsibility. The carrier shall 
attempt to correct any condition causing distress and shall consult the 
shipper concerning any possible need for veterinary care if no 
veterinary attendant is traveling with the shipment; if the shipper 
cannot be reached in the case of an emergency, qualified veterinary care 
should be provided. A veterinarian or qualified attendant traveling with 
the shipment shall be provided access to the animal.
    (b) Unless otherwise specified in writing by the examining 
veterinarian the ambient air temperature in a holding area, transporting 
device, conveyance or terminal facility containing mammals or birds 
shall not be allowed to fall below 12.8 degrees C (55 degrees F) nor to 
exceed 26.7 degrees C (80 degrees F). Auxiliary ventilation shall be 
provided when the ambient air temperature is 23.9 degrees C (75 degrees 
F) or higher. In the case of penguins and auks, the ambient air 
temperature shall not be allowed to exceed 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F) 
at any time, and auxiliary ventilation shall be provided when the 
ambient air temperature exceeds 15.6 degrees C (60 degrees F). In the 
case of polar bears and sea otters, ambient air temperature shall not be 
allowed to exceed 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).


<R05>
Sec. 14.110  Terminal facilities.

    (a) Any terminal facility used for wild mammal or bird transport in 
the country of export, stopover countries, or the United States shall 
contain an animal holding area or areas. No carrier or shipper shall co-
mingle live animal shipments with inanimate cargo in an animal holding 
area.
    (b) A carrier or shipper holding any wild mammal or bird in a 
terminal facility shall provide the following:
    (1) A holding area cleaned and sanitized so as to destroy pathogenic 
agents, maintained so that there is no accumulation of debris or 
excreta, and in which vermin infestation is minimized;
    (2) An effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, 
and pests of mammals or birds;
    (3) Sufficient fresh air to allow the animals to breathe normally 
with ventilation maintained so as to minimize drafts, odors, and 
moisture condensation;
    (4) Ambient air temperatures maintained within prescribed limits as 
specified in Sec. 14.109(b).


<R05>
Sec. 14.111  Handling.

    (a) Care shall be exercised to avoid handling the primary enclosure 
in a manner likely to cause physical or psychological trauma to the 
mammal or bird.
    (b) A primary enclosure used to move any mammal or bird shall not be 
dropped, tipped excessively, or otherwise mishandled, and shall not be 
stacked or placed in a manner that may reasonably be expected to result 
in its falling or being tipped.
    (c) Animals incompatible with one another shall not be crated 
together or held in close proximity.
    (d) Transport of mammals or birds to the United States shall be 
accomplished by the carrier in the most expeditious manner, with the 
fewest stopovers possible, and without unnecessary delays.

[[Page 75]]

    (e) Consistent with other procedures and requirements of the 
carrier, live wild mammals or birds shall be last loaded and first 
unloaded from a conveyance.
    (f) A carrier shall not allow mammals or birds to remain for 
extended periods of time outside a holding area and shall move them 
between a holding area and a conveyance as expeditiously as possible. A 
carrier or shipper maintaining mammals or birds in a holding area, or 
transporting them to or from a holding area or between a holding area 
and a conveyance, shall provide the following:
    (1) Shelter from sunlight. When sunlight is likely to cause 
overheating or discomfort, sufficient shade shall be provided to protect 
animals from the direct rays of the sun.
    (2) Shelter from precipitation. Animals shall be provided protection 
so that they remain dry during rain, snow, or other forms of 
precipitation.
    (3) Shelter from cold. Animals shall be provided protection from 
cold. Protection shall include, but not be limited to, that provided by 
covering and/or heating of transporting devices, holding areas, 
conveyances or terminal facilities.

    (1) Whether the country of export is effectively implementing the 
Convention, particularly with respect to:
    (i) Establishment of a functioning Scientific Authority;
    (ii) The requirements of Article IV of the Convention;
    (iii) Remedial measures recommended by the Parties to the Convention 
with respect to this and similar species, including recommendations of 
permanent committees of the Convention; and
    (iv) Article VIII of the Convention, including but not limited to 
establishment of legislation and infrastructure necessary to enforce the 
Convention, and submission of annual reports to the Convention's 
Secretariat;
    (2) Whether the country of export has developed a scientifically-
based management plan for the species that:
    (i) Provides for the conservation of the species and its habitat(s);
    (ii) Includes incentives for conservation unless the species is a 
documented pest species;
    (iii) Is adequately implemented and enforced;
    (iv) Ensures that the use of the species is:
    (A) Sustainable;
    (B) Maintained throughout its range at a level that is consistent 
with the species' role in its ecosystem; and
    (C) Is well above the level at which the species might become 
threatened;
    (v) Addresses illegal trade, domestic trade, subsistence use, 
disease, and habitat loss; and
    (vi) Ensures that the methods of capture, transport, and maintenance 
of the species minimize the risk of injury, damage to health, and 
inhumane treatment; and
    (3) If the species has a multi-national distribution:
    (i) Whether populations of the species in other countries in which 
it occurs will not be detrimentally affected by exports of the species 
from the country requesting approval;
    (ii) Whether factors affecting conservation of the species, 
including export from other countries, illegal trade, domestic use, or 
subsistence use are regulated throughout the range of the species so 
that recruitment and/or breeding stocks of the species will not be 
detrimentally affected by the proposed export;
    (iii) Whether the projected take and export will not detrimentally 
affect breeding populations; and
    (iv) Whether the projected take and export will not detrimentally 
affect existing enhancement activities, conservation programs, or 
enforcement efforts throughout the species' range.
    (4) For purposes of applying the criterion in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) 
of this section, the Director may give positive consideration to plans 
wherein very conservative capture and export quotas are implemented 
prior to being able to obtain all of the biological information 
necessary for a more large-scale management plan, if the country can 
demonstrate that such conservative capture and export quotas are non-
detrimental to the species survival in the wild under the criterion in 
paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section.
    (c) Publication in the Federal Register. The Director shall publish 
notice in the Federal Register of the availability of each complete 
sustainable use management plan received under paragraph (a) of this 
section. Each notice shall invite the submission from interested parties 
of written data, views, or arguments with respect to the proposed 
approval.
    (d) Duration of approval. A species and country of export listed in 
section 15.33 as approved shall be approved for 3 years, at which time 
renewal of approval shall be considered by the Service.

uneviscerated salmonid fish (family Salmonidae), live fertilized eggs, 
or gametes of salmonid fish are prohibited entry into the United States 
for any purpose except by direct shipment accompanied by a certification 
that: as defined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the fish lots, 
from which the shipments originated, have been sampled; virus assays 
have been conducted on the samples according to methods described in 
paragraphs (e)(2) through (4); of this section; and Oncorhynchus masou 
virus and the viruses causing viral hemorrhagic septicemia, infectious 
hematopoietic necrosis, and infectious pancreatic necrosis have not been

addition, live salmonid fish can be imported into the United States only 
upon written approval from the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service.
    (4) All live fish eggs of salmonid fish must be disinfected within 
24 hours prior to shipment to the United States. Disinfection shall be 
accomplished by immersion for 15 minutes in a 75 part per million 
(titratable active iodine) non-detergent solution of 
polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine (iodophor)

[[Page 95]]

buffered to a pH of 6.0 to 7.0. Following disinfection, the eggs shall 
be rinsed and maintained in water free of fish pathogens until packed 
and shipped. Any ice or water used for shipping shall be from pathogen-
free water.
    (b)(1) The certification to accompany importations as required by 
this section shall consist of a statement in the English language, 
printed or typewritten, stating that this shipment of dead uneviscerated 
salmonid fish, live salmonid fish, or live, disinfected fertilized eggs 
or gametes of salmonid fish has been tested, by the methods outlined in 
this section, and none of the listed viruses were detected. The 
certification shall be signed in the country of origin by a qualified 
fish pathologist designated as a certifying official by the Director.
    (2) The certification must contain:
    (i) The date and port of export in the country of origin and the 
anticipated date of arrival in the United States and port of entry;
    (ii) Surface vessel name or number or air carrier and flight number;
    (iii) Bill of lading number or airway bill number;
    (iv) The date and location where fish, tissue, or fluid samples were 
collected;
    (v) The date and location where virus assays were completed; and
    (vi) The original handwritten signature, in ink, of the certifying 
official and his or her address and telephone number.
    (3) Certification may be substantially in the following form:

    I, --------, designated by the Director of the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service on -------- (date), as a certifying official for ------
-- (country), as required by Title 50, CFR 16.13, do hereby certify that 
the fish lot(s) of origin for this shipment of -------- (weight in 
kilograms) dead uneviscerated salmonid fish, live salmonid fish, live 
salmonid fish eggs disinfected as described in Sec. 16.13, or live 
salmonid gametes to be shipped under -------- (bill of lading number or  
airway  bill  number),  were  sampled  at -------- (location  of  fish  
facility)  on -------- (sampling date) and the required viral assays 
were completed on -------- (date assays were completed) at -------- 
(location where assays were conducted) using the methodology described 
in Sec. 16.13. I further certify that Oncorhynchus masou virus and the 
viruses causing viral hemorrhagic septicemia, infectious hematopoietic 
necrosis, and infectious pancreatic necrosis have not been detected in 
viral assays of the fish lot(s) of origin.
    The shipment is scheduled to depart -------- (city and country) on 
-------- (date), via -------- (name of carrier) with anticipated arrival 
at the port of -------- (city), U.S.A., on -------- (date).

    (c) Nothing in this part shall restrict the importation and 
transportation of dead salmonid fish when such fish have been 
eviscerated (all internal organs removed, gills may remain) or filleted 
or when such fish or eggs have been processed by canning, pickling, 
smoking, or otherwise prepared in a manner whereby the Oncorhynchus 
masou virus and the viruses causing viral hemorrhagic septicemia, 
infectious hematopoietic necrosis, and infectious pancreatic necrosis 
have been killed.
    (d) Any fish caught in the wild in North America under a valid sport 
or commercial fishing license shall be exempt from sampling and 
certification requirements and from filing the Declaration for 
Importation of Wildlife. The Director may enter into formal agreements 
allowing the importation of gametes, fertilized eggs, live fish, or 
dead, uneviscerated fish without inspection and certification of 
pathogen status, if the exporting Nation has an acceptable program of 
inspection and pathogen control in operation, can document the 
occurrence and distribution of fish pathogens within its boundaries, and 
can demonstrate that importation of salmonid fishes into the United 
States from that National will not pose a substantial risk to the public 
and private fish stocks of the United States.
    (e) Fish sampling requirements, sample processing, and methods for 
virus assays--(1) Fish sampling requirements. (i) Sampling for virus 
assays required by this section must be conducted within

[[Page 96]]

the six (6) months prior to the date of shipment of dead uneviscerated 
salmonid fish, live salmonid fish, live salmonid eggs, or salmonid 
gametes to the United States. Sampling shall be on a lot-by-lot basis 
with the samples from each lot distinctively marked, maintained, and 
processed for virus assay separately. A fish lot is defined as a group 
of fish of the same species and age that originated from the same 
discrete spawning population and that always have shared a common water 
supply. In the case of adult broodstock, various age groups of the same 
fish species may be sampled as a single lot, provided they meet the 
other conditions previously stated and have shared the same container(s) 
for at least 1 year prior to the sampling date.
    (ii) In a sample, or sub-sample of a given lot, collection of 10 or 
more moribund fish shall be given first preference. The remainder of 
fish required for collection shall be randomly selected live fish from 
all containers occupied by the lot being sampled. Moribund fish shall be 
collected and processed separately from randomly selected fish. In the 
event the sample is taken from adult broodstock of different ages that 
share the same container, first preference shall be given to collecting 
samples from the older fish.
    (iii) The minimum sample numbers collected from each lot must be in 
accordance with a plan that provides 95 percent confidence that at least 
one fish, with a detectable level of infection, will be collected and 
will be present in the sample if the assumed minimum prevalence of 
infection equals or exceeds 2 percent. A total of 150 fish collected 
proportionately from among all containers shared by the lot usually 
meets this requirement. A sampling strategy based on a presumed pathogen 
prevalence of 5 percent (60 fish) may be used to meet sampling 
requirements for shipments of gametes, fertilized eggs, or uneviscerated 
dead fish; provided that in the previous 2 years no disease outbreaks 
caused by a pathogen of concern have occurred at the facility from which 
the shipment originated and all stocks held at the facility have been 
inspected at least four times during that period (at intervals of 
approximately 6 months) and no pathogens of concern detected.
    (iv) Fish must be alive when collected and processed within 48 hours 
after collection. Tissue and fluid samples shall be stored in sealed, 
aseptic containers and kept at 4[deg] Celsius (C.) or on ice but not 
frozen.
    (v) Tissue collection shall be as follows:
    (A) Sac Fry and fry to 4 centimeter (cm): Assay entire fish. If 
present, remove the yolk sac.
    (B) Fish 4-6 cm: Assay entire visceral mass including kidney.
    (C) Fish longer than 6 cm: Assay kidney and spleen in approximately 
equal weight proportions.
    (D) Spawning adult broodstock: Assay kidney and spleen tissues from 
males and/or females and ovarian fluid from females. Ovarian fluid may 
comprise up to 50 percent of the samples collected.
    (2) General sample processing requirements. (i) Ovarian fluid 
samples shall be collected from each spawning female separately. All 
samples from individual fish shall be measured to ensure that similar 
quantities from each fish are combined if samples are pooled. Ovarian 
fluid samples from no more than five fish may be combined to form a 
pool.
    (ii) Whole fry (less yolk sacs), viscera, and kidney and spleen 
tissues from no more than five fish may be similarly pooled.
    (iii) Antibiotics and antifungal agents may be added to ovarian 
fluid or tissue samples to control microbial contaminant growth at the 
time of sample collection. Final concentrations shall not exceed 200-500 
micrograms/milliliter ([micro]g/ml) of Gentamycin, 800 international 
units/milliliter (IU/ml) of penicillin, or 800 [micro]g/ml of 
streptomycin. Antifungal agent concentrations should not exceed 200 IU/
ml of mycostatin (Nystatin) of 20 [micro]g/ml of amphotericin B 
(Fungizone).
    (iv) Sample temperature must be maintained between 4 at 15 [deg]C. 
during processing. Use separate sets of sterile homogenization and 
processing equipment to process fluids or tissues from each fish lot 
sampled. Processing equipment need not be sterilized between samples 
within a single lot.

[[Page 97]]

    (v) Homogenized tissue samples may be diluted 1:10 with buffered 
cell culture medium (pH 7.4-7.8) containing antibiotics and antifungal 
agents not exceeding the concentrations described in paragraph 
(e)(2)(iii) of this section. Centrifuge tissue suspensions and ovarian 
fluid samples 4 [deg]C. at 2,500 x gravity (g) (relative centrifugal 
force) for 15 minutes. Resulting supernatant solutions can be stored 
overnight at 4 [deg]C.
    (vi) At the time of inoculation onto cell cultures, total dilution 
of processed tissue samples must not exceed 1:100 ((volume to volume) 
(v/v)); total dilution of ovarian fluid samples must not exceed 1:20 (v/
v). In samples inoculated onto cell cultures, the final antibiotic 
concentration shall not exceed 100 [micro]g/ml of Gentamicin, 100 IU/ml 
of penicillin, or 100 [micro]g/ml of streptomycin and antifungal agent 
concentrations should not exceed 25 IU/ml of mycostatin (Nystatin) or 
2.5 [micro]g/ml of amphotericin B (Fungizone).
    (3) Cell culture procedures. (i) Both epithelioma papulosum cyprini 
(EPC) and chinook salmon embryo (CHSE-214) cell lines must be maintained 
and used in all virus assays. Susceptible, normal appearing, and rapidly 
dividing cell cultures shall be selected. Penicillin (100 IU/ml), 
streptomycin (100 [micro]g/ml), and antifungal agents, such as 
mycostatin/Nystatin (25 IU/ml) or amphotericin B/Fungizone (2.5 
[micro]g/ml), are permitted in media used for cell culture and virus 
assay work.
    (ii) Cell cultures shall be seeded and grown, at optimum 
temperatures, to 80-90 percent confluence in 24-well plates for virus 
assay work.
    (iii) Decant the medium from the required number of 24-well plates 
of each cell line, and inoculate four replicate wells per cell line with 
.10 ml per well of each processed sample. When all wells have been 
inoculated, tilt plates to spread the inocula evenly. Incubate 
inoculated plates for 1 hour at 15 [deg]C. for sample contact. After the 
1 hour contact add cell culture medium. Medium shall be buffered or 
cells incubated so that a pH between 7.4 and 7.8 is maintained. All cell 
culture assays shall be incubated, without overlays, at 15 [deg]C. for 
21 days.
    (4) Virus identification by serological methods. All cell cultures 
showing cytopathic effects (CPE) must be sub-cultured onto fresh cell 
cultures. If CPE is observed, determine the presence and identity the 
virus by serum neutralization, dot blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay, or other equivalent serological technique.
