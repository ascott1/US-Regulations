                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2011), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
April 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in eleven separate 
volumes. For the period beginning April 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY

    The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of 
Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a 
``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used 
editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and 
not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as 
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after 
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please 
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, 
or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities 
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an 
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in 
this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.

[[Page vii]]

    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

is, or is intended to be, distributed or sold. The term includes any 
physical apparatus used to deliver or apply the pesticide if distributed 
or sold with the pesticide.
    Plant-incorporated protectant means a pesticidal substance that is 
intended to be produced and used in a living plant, or in the produce 
thereof, and the genetic material necessary for production of such a 
pesticidal substance. It also includes any inert ingredient contained in 
the plant, or produce thereof.
    Released for shipment. A product becomes released for shipment when 
the producer has packaged and labeled it in the manner in which it will 
be distributed or sold, or has stored it in an area where finished 
products are ordinarily held for shipment. Products stored in an area 
where finished products are ordinarily held for shipment, but which are 
not intended to be released for shipment must be physically separated 
and marked as not yet released for shipment. Once a product becomes 
released for shipment, the product remains in the condition of being 
released for shipment unless subsequent activities, such as relabeling 
or repackaging, constitute production.
    Residential use means use of a pesticide directly:
    (1) On humans or pets,
    (2) In, on, or around any structure, vehicle, article, surface, or

Sec. 152.5  Pests.

    An organism is declared to be a pest under circumstances that make 
it deleterious to man or the environment, if it is:
    (a) Any vertebrate animal other than man;
    (b) Any invertebrate animal, including but not limited to, any 
insect, other arthropod, nematode, or mollusk such as a slug and snail, 
but excluding any internal parasite of living man or other living 
animals;
    (c) Any plant growing where not wanted, including any moss, alga, 
liverwort, or other plant of any higher order, and any plant part such 
as a root; or
    (d) Any fungus, bacterium, virus, or other microorganism, except for 
those on or in living man or other living animals and those on or in 
processed food or processed animal feed, beverages, drugs (as defined in 
FFDCA sec. 201(g)(1)) and cosmetics (as defined in FFDCA sec. 201(i)).


<R05>
Sec. 152.6  Substances excluded from regulation by FIFRA.

    Products and substances listed in this section are excluded from 
FIFRA regulation if they meet the specified conditions or criteria.
    (a) Liquid chemical sterilants. A liquid chemical sterilant product 
is not a pesticide under section 2(u) of FIFRA if it meets all of the 
following criteria. Excluded products are regulated by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA). Products excluded are those meeting all of the 
following criteria:
    (1) Composition. The product must be in liquid form as sold or 
distributed. Pressurized gases or products in dry or semi-solid form are 
not excluded by this provision. Ethylene oxide products are not liquid 
products and are not excluded by this provision.

[[Page 9]]

    (2) Claims. The product must bear a sterilant claim, or a sterilant 
plus subordinate level disinfection claim. Products that bear 
antimicrobial claims solely at a level less than ``sterilant'' are not 
excluded and are jointly regulated by EPA and FDA.
    (3) Use site. (i) The product must be intended and labeled only for 
use on ``critical or semi-critical devices.'' A ``critical device'' is 
any device which is introduced directly into the human body, either into 
or in contact with the bloodstream or normally sterile areas of the 
body. A semi-critical device is any device which contacts intact mucous 
membranes but which does not ordinarily penetrate the blood barrier or 
otherwise enter normally sterile areas of the body.
    (ii) Liquid chemical sterilants that bear claims solely for use on 
non-critical medical devices are jointly regulated by EPA and FDA.
    (iii) Liquid chemical sterilants that bear claims solely for use on 
sites that are not medical devices, such as veterinary equipment, are 
not excluded and are regulated solely by EPA.
    (b) Nitrogen stabilizers. A nitrogen stabilizer is excluded from 
regulation under FIFRA if it is a substance (or mixture of substances), 
meeting all of the following criteria:
    (1) The substance prevents or hinders the process of nitrification, 
denitrification, ammonia volatilization, or urease production through 
action affecting soil bacteria and is distributed and sold solely for 
those purposes and no other pesticidal purposes. For purposes of this 
section, living organisms are not considered to be substances, and the 
actions of living organisms are not relevant to whether a substance is 
deemed to be a nitrogen stabilizer.
    (2) The substance was in ``commercial agronomic use'' in the United 
States before January 1, 1992. EPA considers a substance to be in 
commercial agronomic use if it is available for sale or distribution to 
users for direct agronomic benefit, as opposed to limited research, 
experimental or demonstration use.
    (3) The substance was not registered under FIFRA before January 1, 
1992.
    (4) Since January 1, 1992, the distributor or seller has made no 
claim that the product prevents or hinders the process of nitrification, 
denitrification, ammonia volatilization or urease production. EPA 
considers any of the following claims (or their equivalents) to be a 
claim that the product prevents or hinders nitrification, 
denitrification, ammonia volatilization or urease production:
    (i) Improves crop utilization of applied nitrogen.
    (ii) Reduces leaching of applied nitrogen or reduces groundwater 
nitrogen contamination.
    (iii) Prevents nitrogen loss.
    (iv) Prolongs availability of nitrogen.
    (v) Increases nitrogen uptake, availability, usage, or efficiency.
    (5) A product will be considered to have met the criterion of 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section that no nitrogen stabilization claim 
has been made if:
    (i) The nitrogen stabilization claim, in whatever terms expressed, 
is made solely in compliance with a State requirement to include the 
claim in materials required to be submitted to a State legislative or 
regulatory authority, or in the labeling or other literature 
accompanying the product; and
    (ii) The State requirement to include the claim was in effect both 
before the product bearing the claim was introduced into commercial 
agronomic use, and before the effective date of this rule.
    (6) A product that meets all of the criteria of this paragraph with 
respect to one State is not thereby excluded from FIFRA regulation if 
distributed and sold in another State whose nitrogen stabilization 
statement requirement does not meet the requirements of paragraph 
(b)(5)(ii) of this section.
    (c) Human drugs. Fungi, bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms in 
or on living man are not ``pests'' as defined in section 2(t) of FIFRA. 
Products intended and labeled for use against such organisms are human 
drugs subject to regulation by the FDA under the FFDCA.
    (d) Animal drugs. (1) Fungi, viruses, bacteria or other 
microorganisms on or in living animals are not ``pests'' under section 
2(t) of FIFRA. Products intended for use against such organisms

[[Page 10]]

are ``animal drugs'' regulated by the FDA under the FFDCA.
    (2) A ``new animal drug'' as defined in section 201(w) of the FFDCA, 
or an animal drug that FDA has determined is not a ``new animal drug'' 
is not a pesticide under section 2(u) of FIFRA. Animal drugs are 
regulated by the FDA under the FFDCA.
    (e) Animal feeds. An animal feed containing a new animal drug is not 
a pesticide under section 2(u) of FIFRA. An animal feed containing a new 
animal drug is subject to regulation by the FDA under the FFDCA.
    (f) Vitamin hormone products. A product consisting of a mixture of 
plant hormones, plant nutrients, inoculants, or soil amendments is not a 
``plant regulator'' under section 2(v) of FIFRA, provided it meets the 
following criteria:
    (1) The product, in the undiluted package concentration at which it 
is distributed or sold, meets the criteria of Sec. 156.62 of this 
chapter for Toxicity Category III or IV; and
    (2) The product is not intended for use on food crop sites, and is 
labeled accordingly.
    (g) Products intended to aid the growth of desirable plants. A 
product of any of the following types, intended only to aid the growth 
of desirable plants, is not a ``plant regulator'' under section 2(v) of 
FIFRA, and therefore is not a pesticide:
    (1) A plant nutrient product, consisting of one or more 
macronutrients or micronutrient trace elements necessary to normal 
growth of plants and in a form readily usable by plants.
    (2) A plant inoculant product consisting of microorganisms to be 
applied to the plant or soil for the purpose of enhancing the 
availability or uptake of plant nutrients through the root system.
    (3) A soil amendment product containing a substance or substances 
intended for the purpose of improving soil characteristics favorable for 
plant growth.

Sec. 152.8  Products that are not pesticides because they are not for use against pests.

    A substance or article is not a pesticide, because it is not 
intended for use against ``pests'' as defined in Sec. 152.5, if it is:
    (a) A fertilizer product not containing a pesticide.
    (b) A product intended to force bees from hives for the collection 
of honey crops.

Sec. 152.10  Products that are not pesticides because they are not intended for a pesticidal purpose.

    A product that is not intended to prevent, destroy, repel, or 
mitigate a pest, or to defoliate, desiccate or regulate the growth of 
plants, is not considered to be a pesticide. The following types of 
products or articles are not considered to be pesticides unless a 
pesticidal claim is made on their labeling or in connection with their 
sale and distribution:
    (a) Deodorizers, bleaches, and cleaning agents;
    (b) Products not containing toxicants, intended only to attract 
pests for survey or detection purposes, and labeled accordingly;
    (c) Products that are intended to exclude pests only by providing a 
physical barrier against pest access, and which contain no toxicants, 
such as certain pruning paints to trees.


<R05>
Sec. 152.15  Pesticide products required to be registered.

    No person may distribute or sell any pesticide product that is not 
registered under the Act, except as provided in Sec. Sec. 152.20, 
152.25, and 152.30. A pesticide is any substance (or mixture of 
substances) intended for a pesticidal purpose, i.e., use for the purpose 
of preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest or use as a 
plant regulator, defoliant, or desiccant. A substance is considered to 
be intended for a pesticidal purpose, and thus to be a pesticide 
requiring registration, if:
    (a) The person who distributes or sells the substance claims, 
states, or implies (by labeling or otherwise):

[[Page 11]]

    (1) That the substance (either by itself or in combination with any 
other substance) can or should be used as a pesticide; or
    (2) That the substance consists of or contains an active ingredient 
and that it can be used to manufacture a pesticide; or
    (b) The substance consists of or contains one or more active 
ingredients and has no significant commercially valuable use as 
distributed or sold other than (1) use for pesticidal purpose (by itself 
or in combination with any other substance), (2) use for manufacture of 
a pesticide; or
    (c) The person who distributes or sells the substance has actual or 
constructive knowledge that the substance will be used, or is intended 
to be used, for a pesticidal purpose.

<R05>
Sec. 152.20  Exemptions for pesticides adequately regulated by another Federal agency.

    The pesticides or classes of pesticide listed in this section are 
exempt from all requirements of FIFRA. The Agency has determined, in 
accordance with FIFRA sec. 25(b)(1), that they are adequately regulated 
by another Federal agency.
    (a) Certain biological control agents. (1) Except as provided by 
paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section, all biological control 
agents are exempt from FIFRA requirements.
    (2) If the Agency determines that an individual biological control 
agent or class of biological control agents is no longer adequately 
regulated by another Federal agency, and that it should not otherwise be 
exempted from the requirements of FIFRA, the Agency will revoke this 
exemption by amending paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
    (3) The following biological control agents are not exempt from 
FIFRA requirements:
    (i) A eucaryotic microorganism including, but not limited to, 
protozoa, algae and fungi;
    (ii) A procaryotic microorganism including, but not limited to, 
Eubacteria and Archaebacteria; or
    (iii) A parasitically-replicating microscopic element, including, 
but not limited to, viruses.
    (4) All living plants intended for use as biological control agents 
are exempt from the requirements of FIFRA. However, plant-incorporated 
protectants are not exempt pursuant to this section. Regulations, 
including exemptions, for plant-incorporated protectants are addressed 
in part 174 of this chapter.
    (b) Non-liquid chemical sterilants. A non-liquid chemical sterilant, 
except ethylene oxide, that meets the criteria of Sec. 152.6(a)(2) with 
respect to its claims and Sec. 152.6(a)(3) with respect to its use 
sites is exempted from regulation under FIFRA.

<R05>
Sec. 152.25  Exemptions for pesticides of a character not requiring FIFRA regulation.

    The pesticides or classes of pesticides listed in this section have 
been determined to be of a character not requiring regulation under 
FIFRA, and are therefore exempt from all provisions of FIFRA when 
intended for use, and used, only in the manner specified.
    (a) Treated articles or substances. An article or substance treated 
with, or containing, a pesticide to protect the article or substance 
itself (for example, paint treated with a pesticide to protect the paint 
coating, or wood products treated to protect the wood against insect or 
fungus infestation), if the pesticide is registered for such use.
    (b) Pheromones and pheromone traps. Pheromones and identical or 
substantially similar compounds labeled for use only in pheromone traps 
(or labeled for use in a manner which the Administrator determines poses 
no greater risk of adverse effects on the environment than use in 
pheromone traps), and pheromone traps in which those compounds are the 
sole active ingredient(s).
    (1) For the purposes of this paragraph, a pheromone is a compound 
produced by an arthropod which, alone or

[[Page 12]]

in combination with other such compounds, modifies the behavior of other 
individuals of the same species.
    (2) For the purposes of this paragraph, a synthetically produced 
compound is identical to a pheromone only when their molecular 
structures are identical, or when the only differences between the 
molecular structures are between the stereochemical isomer ratios of the 
two compounds, except that a synthetic compound found to have 
toxicological properties significantly different from a pheromone is not 
identical.
    (3) When a compound possesses many characteristics of a pheromone 
but does not meet the criteria in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it 
may, after review by the Agency, be deemed a substantially similar 
compound.
    (4) For the purposes of this paragraph, a pheromone trap is a device 
containing a pheromone or an identical or substantially similar compound 
used for the sole purpose of attracting, and trapping or killing, target 
arthropods. Pheromone traps are intended to achieve pest control by 
removal of target organisms from their natural environment and do not 
result in increased levels of pheromones or identical or substantially 
similar compounds over a significant fraction of the treated area.
    (c) Preservatives for biological specimens. (1) Embalming fluids.
    (2) Products used to preserve animal or animal organ specimens, in 
mortuaries, laboratories, hospitals, museums and institutions of 
learning.
    (3) Products used to preserve the integrity of milk, urine, blood, 
or other body fluids for laboratory analysis.
    (d) Foods. Products consisting of foods and containing no active 
ingredients, which are used to attract pests.
    (e) Natural cedar. (1) Natural cedar blocks, chips, shavings, balls, 
chests, drawer liners, paneling, and needles that meet all of the 
following criteria:
    (i) The product consists totally of cedarwood or natural cedar.
    (ii) The product is not treated, combined, or impregnated with any 
additional substance(s).
    (iii) The product bears claims or directions for use solely to repel 
arthropods other than ticks or to retard mildew, and no additional 
claims are made in sale or distribution. The labeling must be limited to 
specific arthropods, or must exclude ticks if any general term such as 
``arthropods,'' ``insects,'' ``bugs,'' or any other broad inclusive 
term, is used. The exemption does not apply to natural cedar products 
claimed to repel ticks.
    (2) The exemption does not apply to cedar oil, or formulated 
products which contain cedar oil, other cedar extracts, or ground cedar 
wood as part of a mixture.
    (f) Minimum risk pesticides--(1) Exempted products. Products 
containing the following active ingredients are exempt from the 
requirements of FIFRA, alone or in combination with other substances 
listed in this paragraph, provided that all of the criteria of this 
section are met.

Castor oil (U.S.P. or equivalent)
Cedar oil
Cinnamon and cinnamon oil
Citric acid
Citronella and citronella oil
Cloves and clove oil

<R05>
Sec. 152.40  Who may apply.

    Any person may apply for new registration of a pesticide product. 
Any registrant may apply for amendment of the registration of his 
product.


<R05>
Sec. 152.42  Application for new registration.

    Any person seeking to obtain a registration for a new pesticide 
product must submit an application for registration, containing the 
information specified in Sec. 152.50. An application for new 
registration must be approved by the Agency before the product may 
legally be distributed or sold, except as provided by Sec. 152.30.


<R05>
Sec. 152.43  Alternate formulations.

    (a) A product proposed for registration must have a single, defined 
composition, except that EPA may approve a basic formulation and one or 
more alternate formulations for a single product.
    (b) An alternate formulation must meet the criteria listed in 
paragraph (b) (1) through (4) of this section. The Agency may require 
the submission of data to determine whether the criteria have been met.
    (1) The alternate formulation must have the same certified limits 
for each active ingredient as the basic formulation.
    (2) If the alternate formulation contains an inert ingredient or 
impurity of toxicological signficance, the formulation must have the 
same upper certified limit for that substance as the basic formulation;
    (3) The label text of the alternate formulation product must be 
identical to that of the basic formulation.
    (4) The analytical method required under Sec. 158.355 of this 
chapter must be suitable for use on both the basic formulation and the 
alternate formulation.
    (c) Notwithstanding the criteria in this section, the Agency may 
determine that an alternate formulation must be separately registered. 
If EPA makes this determination, the Agency will notify the applicant of 
its determination and its reasons. Thereafter the application for an 
alternate formulation will be treated as an application for new 
registration, and the alternate formulation will be assigned a new 
registration number.

Sec. 152.44  Application for amended registration.

    (a) Except as provided by Sec. 152.46, any modification in the 
composition, labeling, or packaging of a registered product must be 
submitted with an application for amended registration. The applicant 
must submit the information required by Sec. 152.50, as applicable to 
the change requested. If an application for amended registration is 
required, the application must be approved by the Agency before the 
product, as modified, may legally be distributed or sold.
    (b) In its discretion, the Agency may:
    (1) Waive the requirement for submission of an application for 
amended registration;
    (2) Require that the applicant certify to the Agency that he has 
complied with an Agency directive rather than submit an application for 
amended registration; or
    (3) Permit an applicant to modify a registration by notification or 
non-notification in accordance with Sec. 152.46.
    (c) A registrant may at any time submit identical minor labeling 
amendments affecting a number of products as a single application if no 
data are required for EPA to approve the amendment (for example, a 
change in the wording of a storage statement for designated residential 
use products). A consolidated application must clearly identify the 
labeling modification(s) to be made (which must be identical for all 
products included in the application), list the registration number of 
each product for which the modification is requested, and provide 
required supporting materials (for example, labeling) for each affected 
product.

<R05>
Sec. 152.46  Notification and non-notification changes to registrations.

    (a) Changes permitted by notification. (1) EPA may determine that 
certain minor modifications to registration having no potential to cause 
unreasonable adverse effects to the environment may be accomplished by 
notification to the Agency, without requiring that the registrant obtain 
Agency approval. If EPA so determines, it will issue procedures 
following an opportunity for public comment describing the types of 
modifications permitted by notification and any conditions and 
procedures for submitting notifications.
    (2) A registrant may modify a registration consistent with paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section and any procedures issued thereunder and 
distribute or sell the modified product as soon as the Agency has 
received the notification. Based upon the notification, the Agency may 
require that the registrant submit an application for amended 
registration. If it does so, the Agency will notify the registrant and 
state its reasons for requiring an application for amended registration. 
Thereafter, if the registrant fails to submit an application the Agency 
may determine that the product is not in compliance with the 
requirements of the Act. Notification under this paragraph is considered 
a report filed under the Act for the purposes of FIFRA section 
12(a)(2)(M).
    (b) Changes permitted without notification. EPA may determine that 
certain minor modifications to registration having no potential to cause 
unreasonable adverse effects to the environment may be accomplished 
without notification to or approval by the Agency. If EPA so determines, 
it will issue procedures following an opportunity for public comment 
describing the types of amendments permitted without notification (also 
known as non-notification). A registrant may distribute or sell a 
product changed in a manner consistent with such procedures without 
notification to or approval by the Agency.
    (c) Effect of non-compliance. Notwithstanding any other provision of 
this section, if the Agency determines that a product has been modified 
through notification or without notification in a manner inconsistent 
with paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section and any procedures issued 
thereunder, the Agency may initiate regulatory and/or enforcement action 
without first providing the registrant with an opportunity to submit an 
application for amended registration.

[61 FR 33041, June 26, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 152.50  Contents of application.

    Each application for registration or amended registration must 
include the following information, as applicable:
    (a) Application form. An application form must be completed and 
submitted to the Agency. Application forms are provided by the Agency, 
with instructions as to the number of copies required and proper 
completion.
    (b) Identity of the applicant--(1) Name. The applicant must identify 
himself. An applicant not residing in the United States must also 
designate an agent in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section 
to act on behalf of the applicant on all registration matters.
    (2) Address of record. The applicant must provide an address in the 
United States for correspondence purposes. The U.S. address provided 
will be considered the applicant's address of record, and EPA will send 
all correspondence concerning the application and any subsequent 
registration to that address. It is the responsibility of the applicant 
and any registrant under Sec. 152.122 to ensure that the Agency has a 
current and accurate address.
    (3) Authorized agent. An applicant may designate a person residing 
in the United States to act as his agent. If an applicant wishes to 
designate an agent, he must send the Agency a letter stating the name 
and United States address of his agent. The applicant must notify the 
Agency if he changes his designated agent. This relationship may be 
terminated at any time by the applicant by notifying the Agency in 
writing.
    (4) Company number. If an applicant has been assigned a company 
number by the Agency, the application must reference that number.
    (c) Summary of the application. Each application must include a list 
of the data submitted with the application, together with a brief 
description of the

[[Page 16]]

results of the studies. The list of data submitted may be the same as 
the list required by Sec. 158.32 or Sec. 161.32, as applicable, of 
this chapter. The summary must state that it is releasable to the public 
after registration in accordance with Sec. 152.119.
    (d) Identity of the product. The product for which application is 
being submitted must be identified. The following information is 
required:

    (3) The EPA Registration Number, if currently registered.
    (e) Draft labeling. Each application for new registration must be 
accompanied by five legible copies of draft labeling (typescript or 
mock-up). Each application for amended registration that proposes to 
make any changes in the product labeling must be accompanied by five 
legible copies of draft labeling incorporating the proposed labeling 
changes. If the proposed labeling change affects only a portion of the 
labeling, such as the use directions, the applicant may submit five 
copies of that portion of the label which is the subject of the 
amendment. Upon request, an applicant for amended registration must 
submit a complete label to consolidate amendments.
    (f) Registration data requirements. (1) An applicant must submit 
materials to demonstrate that he has complied with the FIFRA sec. 
3(c)(1)(F) and subpart E of this part with respect to satisfaction of 
data requirements, to enable the Agency to make the determination 
required by FIFRA sec. 3(c)(5)(B). Required items are described in 
subpart E of this part.
    (2) An applicant must furnish any data specified in part 158 or part 
161 of this chapter, as applicable, of this chapter which are required 
by the Agency to determine that the product meets the registration 
standards of FIFRA sec. 3(c)(5) or (7). Each study must comply with:
    (i) Section 158.32 of this chapter, with respect to format of data 
submission.
    (ii) Section 158.33 of this chapter, with respect to studies for 
which a claim of trade secret or confidential business information is 
made.
    (iii) Section 158.34 of this chapter, with respect to flagging for 
potential adverse effects.
    (iv) Section 160.12 of this chapter, with respect to a statement 
whether studies were conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory 
Practices of part 160.
    (3) An applicant shall furnish with his application any factual 
information of which he is aware regarding unreasonable adverse effects 
of the pesticide on man or the environment, which would be required to 
be reported under FIFRA sec. 6(a)(2) if the product were registered.
    (g) Certification relating to child-resistant packaging. If the 
product meets the criteria for child-resistant packaging, the applicant 
must submit a certification that the product will be distributed or sold 
only in child-resistant packaging. Refer to part 157 of this chapter for 
the criteria and certification requirements.
    (h) Request for classification. If an applicant wishes to request a 
classification different from that established by the Agency, he must 
submit a request for such classification and information supporting the 
request.
    (i) Statement concerning tolerances. (1) If the proposed labeling 
bears instructions for use of the pesticide on food or feed crops, or if 
the intended use of the pesticide results or may be expected to result, 
directly or indirectly, in pesticide chemical residues in or on food or 
feed (including residues of any active ingredient, inert ingredient, 
metabolite, or degradation product), the applicant must submit a 
statement indicating whether such residues are authorized by a tolerance 
or exemption from the requirement of a tolerance issued under section 
408 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA).

<R05>
Sec. 152.83  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, the following terms shall have the meanings 
set forth in this section:
    Data gap means the absence of any valid study or studies in the 
Agency's files which would satisfy a specific data requirement for a 
particular pesticide product.
    Data Submitters List means the current Agency list, entitled 
``Pesticide Data Submitters by Chemical,'' of persons who have submitted 
data to the Agency.
    Exclusive use study means a study that meets each of the following 
requirements:
    (1) The study pertains to a new active ingredient (new chemical) or 
new combination of active ingredients (new combination) first registered 
after September 30, 1978;
    (2) The study was submitted in support of, or as a condition of 
approval of, the application resulting in the first registration of a 
product containing such new chemical or new combination (first 
registration), or an application to amend such registration to add a new 
use; and
    (3) The study was not submitted to satisfy a data requirement 
imposed under FIFRA section 3(c)(2)(B);
    Provided that, a study is an exclusive use study only during the 10-
year period following the date of the first registration.
    Original data submitter means the person who possesses all rights to 
exclusive use or compensation under FIFRA section 3(c)(1)(F) in a study 
originally submitted in support of an application for registration, 
amended registration, reregistration, or experimental use permit, or to 
maintain an existing registration in effect. The term includes the 
person who originally submitted the study, any person to whom the rights 
under FIFRA section 3(c)(1)(F) have been transferred, or the authorized 
representative of a group of joint data developers.

[[Page 19]]


<R05>
Sec. 152.85  Formulators' exemption.

    (a) Statutory provision. FIFRA section 3(c)(2)(D) excuses an 
applicant from the requirement to submit or cite data pertaining to any 
pesticide contained in his product that is derived solely from one or 
more EPA-registered products which the applicant purchases from another 
person. This provision is commonly referred to as the formulators' 
exemption.
    (b) Applicability of the formulators' exemption. (1) The 
formulators' exemption applies only to data concerning the purchased 
product or its ingredients. These data may include, but are not limited 
to, product chemistry, toxicology, residue chemistry, exposure, 
environmental fate, and ecological effects.
    (2) The data to which the formulators' exemption applies usually 
will concern the safety of one or more of the product's active 
ingredients, specifically, those active ingredients which are contained 
in the purchased product. In general, data for which the required test 
substance is the technical grade of the active ingredient, the pure 
active ingredient, the radiolabeled pure active ingredient, or a typical 
end-use product are eligible for the formulators' exemption.
    (3) The formulators' exemption generally does not apply to data on 
the applicant's product itself, including the safety or efficacy of the 
product, unless the composition of the product is identical to the 
purchased product. In general, data for which the required test 
substance is the product proposed for registration are not eligible for 
the formulators' exemption.
    (c) Limitation of the formulators' exemption. EPA interprets FIFRA 
section 3(c)(2)(D) as allowing an applicant to use the formulators' 
exemption with respect to data concerning an ingredient of his product 
only if:
    (1) The application indicates that the ingredient's presence in the 
product is attributable solely to the purchase from another person of an 
identified, registered product containing that ingredient and the use of 
the purchased product in formulating the product; and
    (2) The purchased product is a registered manufacturing-use product 
whose label does not prohibit its use for making an end-use product 
labeled for any use for which the applicant's product will be labeled; 
or
    (3) The purchased product is a registered end-use product labeled 
for each use for which the applicant's product will be labeled.
    (d) Claiming eligibility for the exemption. (1) If the product 
contains one or more ingredients eligible for the formulators' 
exemption, the applicant need not comply with the requirements of 
Sec. Sec. 152.90 through 152.96 with respect to any data requirement 
pertaining to such ingredient, provided that he submits to the Agency a 
certification statement containing the following information (a form for 
this purpose is available from the Agency):
    (i) Identification of the applicant, and of the product by EPA 
registration number or file symbol.
    (ii) Identification of each ingredient in the pesticide that is 
eligible for the formulators' exemption, and the EPA registration number 
of the product that is the source of that ingredient.
    (iii) A statement that the listed ingredients meet the requirements 
for the formulators' exemption.
    (iv) A statement that the applicant has submitted (either previously 
or with the current application) a complete, accurate and current 
Confidential Statement of Formula.
    (v) The name, title and signature of the applicant or his authorized 
representative and the date of signature.
    (2) An applicant for amended registration is not required to submit 
a new formulators' exemption statement, if the current statement in 
Agency files is complete and accurate.
    (e) Approval of registration. Notwithstanding FIFRA section 
3(c)(2)(D), EPA will not approve an application unless there are 
available to EPA for its review all data that are necessary to make the 
required risk/benefit finding under FIFRA section 3(c)(5) or section 
3(c)(7).

<R05>
Sec. 152.86  The cite-all method.

    An applicant may comply with this subpart by citing all data in 
Agency files that are pertinent to its consideration of the requested 
registration

[[Page 20]]

under FIFRA section 3(c)(5), in accordance with the procedures in this 
section, as applicable.
    (a) Exclusive use studies. The applicant must certify to the Agency 
that he has obtained, from each person listed on the Data Submitters 
List as an exclusive use data submitter for the chemical in question, a 
written authorization that contains at least the following information:
    (1) Identification of the applicant to whom the authorization is 
granted;
    (2) Authorization to the applicant to use all pertinent studies in 
satisfaction of data requirements for the application in question; and
    (3) The signature and title of the original data submitter or his 
authorized representative and date of the authorization.

If the Agency identifies any exclusive use data submitter not on the 
Data Submitters List, the applicant will be required prior to 
registration to obtain the necessary written authorization from such 
person.
    (b) Other studies. The applicant must certify to the Agency that, 
with respect to each other person on the Data Submitters List for the 
chemical in question:
    (1) He has obtained from that person a written authorization that 
contains the information required by paragraphs (a) (1) through (3) of 
this section; or
    (2) He has furnished to that person:
    (i) A notification of his intent to apply for registration, 
including the name of the proposed product, and a list of the product's 
active ingredients;
    (ii) An offer to pay the person compensation to the extent required 
by FIFRA section 3(c)(1)(F) for any data on which the application 
relies;

terms of compensation, if any, to be paid for the use of any study; and
    (iv) His name, address and telephone number.
    (c) General offer to pay statement. The applicant must submit to the 
Agency the following general offer to pay statement:

    [Name of applicant] hereby offers and agrees to pay compensation to 
other persons, with regard to the approval of this application, to the 
extent required by FIFRA section 3(c)(1)(F) of the Federal Insecticide, 
Fungicide and Rodenticide Act.

<R05>
Sec. 152.90  The selective method.

    An applicant may comply with this subpart by listing the specific 
data requirements that apply to his product, its active ingredients, and 
use patterns, and demonstrating his compliance for each data requirement 
by submitting or citing individual studies, or by demonstrating that no 
study has previously been submitted to the Agency. This section 
summarizes the procedures that an applicant must follow if he chooses 
the selective method of demonstrating compliance. Sections 152.91 
through 152.96 contain specific procedures for citing or submitting a 
study or demonstrating a data gap.
    (a) List of data requirements. Each applicant must submit a list of 
the data requirements that would apply to his pesticide, its active 
ingredients, and its use patterns, if the product were being proposed 
for registration under FIFRA section 3(c)(5) for the first time. The 
applicant need not list data requirements pertaining to any ingredient 
which qualifies for the formulator's exemption.

[[Page 21]]

    (1) If a Registration Standard has been issued for any active 
ingredient, the applicant must list the applicable data requirements 
enumerated in that Standard for the active ingredient and, if end use 
products are covered by the Registration Standard, for such products 
containing that active ingredient.
    (2) If a Registration Standard has not been issued, or if an issued 
Registration Standard does not cover all data requirements for products 
containing the active ingredient in question, the applicant must list 
the applicable requirements as prescribed by 40 CFR part 158 or part 
161, as applicable. All required (R) studies, and any studies that could 
be conditionally required (CR) based upon composition, use pattern, or 
the results of required studies, are to be listed. The applicant may 
demonstrate via the data gap procedures in Sec. 152.96 that a 
conditional requirement need not be satisfied by the submission or 
citation of data at the time of application.
    (b) Methods of demonstrating compliance. The applicant must state 
for each data requirement on the list required by paragraph (a) of this 
section which of the following methods of compliance with the 
requirement he is using, and shall provide the supporting documentation 
specified in the referenced section.
    (1) Existence of or granting of a data waiver. Refer to Sec. 
152.91.
    (2) Submission of a new valid study. Refer to Sec. 152.92.
    (3) Citation of a specific valid study previously submitted to the 
Agency by the applicant or another person, with any necessary written 
authorizations or offers to pay. Refer to Sec. 152.93.
    (4) Citation of a public literature study. Refer to Sec. 152.94.
    (5) Citation of all pertinent studies previously submitted to the 
Agency, with any necessary written authorizations or offers to pay. 
Refer to Sec. 152.95.
    (6) Documentation of a data gap. Refer to Sec. 152.96.

[49 FR 30903, Aug. 1, 1984, as amended at 72 FR 61028, Oct. 26, 2007]


<R05>
Sec. 152.91  Waiver of a data requirement.

    The applicant may demonstrate compliance for a data requirement by 
documenting the existence of a waiver in accordance with paragraph (a) 
of this section, or by being granted a new waiver requested in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (a) Request for extension of an existing waiver. An applicant may 
claim that a waiver previously granted by the Agency also applies to a 
data requirement for his product. To document this claim, the applicant 
must provide a reference to the Agency record that describes the 
previously granted waiver, such as an Agency list of waivers or an 
applicable Registration Standard, and must explain why that waiver 
should apply to his product.
    (b) Request for a new waiver. An applicant who requests a waiver to 
satisfy a data requirement must submit the information specified in 40 
CFR 158.45 or 40 CFR 161.45.
    (c) Effect of denial of waiver request. If the request for a new 
waiver or extension of an existing waiver is denied by the Agency, the 
applicant must choose another method of satisfying the data requirement.

[49 FR 30903, Aug. 1, 1984, as amended at 72 FR 61028, Oct. 26, 2007]


<R05>
Sec. 152.92  Submission of a new valid study.

    An applicant may demonstrate compliance for a data requirement by 
submitting a valid study that has not previously been submitted to the 
Agency. A study previously submitted to the Agency should not be 
resubmitted but should be cited in accordance with Sec. 152.93.


<R05>
Sec. 152.93  Citation of a previously submitted valid study.

    An applicant may demonstrate compliance for a data requirement by 
citing a valid study previously submitted to the Agency. The study is 
not to be submitted to the Agency with the application.
    (a) Study originally submitted by the applicant. If the applicant 
certifies that he is the original data submitter, no documentation other 
than the citation is necessary.
    (b) Study previously submitted by another person. If the applicant 
is not the original data submitter, the applicant may cite the study 
only in accordance

[[Page 22]]

with paragraphs (b) (1) through (3) of this section.
    (1) Citation with authorization of original data submitter. The 
applicant may cite any valid study for which he has obtained the written 
authorization of the original data submitter. The applicant must obtain 
written authorization to cite any study that is an exclusive use study. 
The applicant must certify that he has obtained from the original data 
submitter a written authorization that contains at least the following 
information:
    (i) Identification of the applicant to whom the authorization is 
granted;
    (ii) Identification by title, EPA Accession Number or Master Record 
Identification Number, and date of submission, of the study or studies 
for which the authorization is granted;
    (iii) Authorization to the applicant to use the specified study in 
satisfaction of the data requirement for the application in question; 
and
    (iv) The signature and title of the original data submitter or his 
authorized representative, and date of the authorization.
    (2) Citation with offer to pay compensation to the original data 
submitter. The applicant may cite any valid study that is not subject to 
the exclusive use provisions of FIFRA section 3(c)(1)(F)(i) without 
written authorization from the original data submitter if the applicant 
certifies to the Agency that he has furnished to the original data 
submitter:
    (i) A notification of the applicant's intent to apply for 
registration, including the proposed product name and a list of the 
product's active ingredients;
    (ii) Identification of the specific data requirement involved and of 
the study for which the offer to pay is made (by title, EPA Accession 
Number or Master Record Identification Number, and date of submission, 
if possible);
    (iii) An offer to pay the person compensation to the extent required 
by FIFRA section 3(c)(1)(F);
    (iv) An offer to commence negotiations to determine the amount and 
terms of compensation, if any, to be paid for the use of the study; and
    (v) The applicant's name, address and telephone number.
    (3) Citation without authorization or offer to pay. The applicant 
may cite any valid study without written authorization from, or offer to 
pay to, the original data submitter if the study was originally 
submitted to the Agency on or before the date that is 15 years before 
the date of the application for which it is cited, and the study is not 
an exclusive use study, as defined in Sec. 152.83(c).

[49 FR 30903, Aug. 1, 1984, as amended at 73 FR 75595, Dec. 12, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 152.94  Citation of a public literature study or study generated at government expense.

    (a) An applicant may demonstrate compliance for a data requirement 
by citing, and submitting to the Agency, one of the following:
    (1) A valid study from the public literature.
    (2) A valid study generated by, or at the expense of, any government 
(Federal, State, or local) agency.
    (b) In no circumstances does submission of a public literature study 
or government-generated study confer any rights on the data submitter to 
exclusive use of data or compensation under FIFRA section 3(c)(1)(F).

[49 FR 30903, Aug. 1, 1984, as amended at 73 FR 75595, Dec. 12, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 152.95  Citation of all studies in the Agency's files pertinent to a specific data requirement.

    An applicant normally may demonstrate compliance for a data 
requirement by citation of all studies in the Agency's files pertinent 
of that data requirement. The applicant who selects this cite-all option 
must submit to the Agency:
    (a) A general offer to pay statement having the same wording as that 
specified in Sec. 152.86(c) except that the offer to pay may be limited 
to apply only to data pertinent to the specific data requirement(s) for 
which the cite-all method of support has been selected;
    (b) A certification that:
    (1) For each person who is included on the Data Submitters List as 
an original data submitter of exclusive use data for the active 
ingredient in question, the applicant has obtained a written 
authorization containing the

[[Page 23]]

information required by Sec. 152.86(a) for the use the any exclusive 
use study that would be pertinent to the applicant's product; and
    (2) For each person included on the current Data Submitters List as 
an original data submitter of data that are not exclusive use for the 
active ingredient in question, the applicant has furnished:
    (i) A notification of the applicant's intent to apply for 
registration, including the name of the proposed product, and a list of 
the product's active ingredients;
    (ii) Identification of the specific data requirement(s) for which 
the offer to pay for data is being made;
    (iii) An offer to pay the person compensation to the extent required 
by FIFRA section 3(c)(1)(F);
    (iv) An offer to commence negotiations to determine the amount and 
terms of compensation, if any, to be paid for use of any study; and
    (v) The applicant's name, address and telephone number; and
    (c) An acknowledgment having the same wording as that specified in 
Sec. 152.86(d), except that it may be limited to apply only to data 
pertinent to the specific data requirement(s) for which the cite-all 
method of support has been selected.

[49 FR 30903, Aug. 1, 1984, as amended at 73 FR 75595, Dec. 12, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 152.96  Documentation of a data gap.

    Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, an applicant 
may defer his obligation to satisfy an applicable data requirement until 
the Agency requests the data if he can demonstrate, by the procedure in 
this section, that no other person has previously submitted to the 
Agency a study that would satisfy the data requirement in question.
    (a) When data gap procedures may not be used. (1) An applicant for 
registration of a product containing a new chemical may not defer his 
obligation by the procedure in this section, unless he can demonstrate 
to the Agency's satisfaction that the data requirement was imposed so 
recently that insufficient time has elapsed for the study to have been 
completed and that, in the public interest, the product should be 
registered during the limited period of time required to complete the 
study. Refer to FIFRA section 3(c)(7)(C).
    (2) An applicant for registration of a product under FIFRA section 
3(c)(7) (A) or (B) may not defer his obligation by the procedure in this 
section if the Agency requires the data to determine:
    (i) Whether the product is identical or substantially similar to 
another currently registered product or differs only in ways that would 
not substantially increase the risk of unreasonable adverse effects on 
the environment;
    (ii) If efficacy data are required, whether the product is 
efficacious; or
    (iii) Whether the new use would substantially increase the risk of 
unreasonable adverse effects on the environment, usually required when 
the application involves a new use of a product which is identical or 
substantially similar to a currently registered product.
    (b) Data gap listed in a Registration Standard. The applicant may 
rely on a data gap that is documented by a Registration Standard without 
submitting the certification required by paragraph (c) of this section. 
If the data gap listed in the Registration Standard has been filled 
since the issuance of the Standard, the Agency will notify the applicant 
and require him to choose another method of demonstrating compliance.
    (c) Certification of a data gap. Except as provided by paragraph (b) 
of this section, an applicant who wishes to claim that a data gap exists 
must certify to the Agency that:
    (1) The applicant has furnished, by certified mail, to each original 
data submitter on the current Data Submitters List for the active 
ingredient in question, a notice containing the following information:
    (i) The name and address of the applicant;
    (ii) The name of the product, and a statement that the applicant 
intends to apply for registration of that product;
    (iii) The name(s) of the active ingredient(s) in the procuct;
    (iv) A list of the data requirements for which the applicant intends 
to claim under this section that a data gap exists; and

[[Page 24]]

    (v) A request that the data submitter identify, within 60 days of 
receipt of the notice, any valid study which he has submitted to the 
Agency that would fulfill any of the data requirement(s) listed.
    (2) The applicant has, within that 60-day period, received no 
response, or has received a negative response, from each person 
notified; and
    (3) The applicant has no basis to believe that any data have been 
submitted to the Agency that would fulfill the data requirement, and is 
entitled to claim that a data gap exists.
    (d) Requirement to obtain permission or make offer to pay. In 
responding to a data gap letter, the original data submitter is not 
deemed to have given his authorization for the applicant to cite any 
study which the data submitter identifies in his response. The applicant 
must seek and obtain specific written authorization from, or make an 
offer to pay to, the original data submitter to cite the identified 
study in order to demonstrate compliance for the data requirement. 
Nothing, however, precludes the applicant from requesting written 
authorization or making an offer to pay at the same time that he 
requests confirmation of a data gap.


<R05>
Sec. 152.97  Rights and obligations of data submitters.

    (a) Right to be listed on Data Submitters List. (1) Each original 
data submitter shall have the right to be included on the Agency's Data 
Submitters List.
    (2) Each original data submitter who wishes to have his name added 
to the current Data Submitters List must submit to the Agency the 
following information:
    (i) Name and current address;
    (ii) Chemical name and common name (if any) of the active 
ingredient(s), with respect to which he is an original data submitter;
    (iii) For each such active ingredient, the type(s) of study he has 
previously submitted (corresponding to Guidelines reference numbers 
given in tables in 40 CFR part 158 or part 161, as applicable), the date 
of submission, and the EPA registration number, file symbol, or other 
identifying reference for which it was submitted.
    (3) Each applicant not already included on the Data Submitters List 
for a particular active ingredient must inform the Agency at the time of 
submission of a relevant study whether he wishes to be included on the 
Data Submitters List for that pesticide.
    (b) Obligation to respond to data gap letters. An applicant who 
chooses to defer his obligation by demonstrating the existence of a data 
gap must write to each original data submitter for confirmation that the 
data submitter has not submitted a valid study that would satisfy the 
requirement. The original data submitter is not required to respond to 
such letters. However, if he fails to respond, the applicant is entitled 
to assume (and the Agency will act on the assumption) that the original 
data submitter has not submitted a study to satisfy the requirement. The 
data submitter may thereby limit his right to later challenge the 
applicant's claim if he fails respond in writing delivered to the 
applicant within 60 days of receipt of the applicant's data gap letter.

Sec. 152.98  Procedures for transfer of exclusive use or compensation rights to another person.

    A person who possesses rights to exclusive use or compensation under 
FIFRA section 3(c)(1)(F) may transfer such rights to another person in 
accordance with this section.
    (a) The original data submitter must submit to the Agency a transfer 
document that contains the following information:
    (1) The name, address and state of incorporation (if any) of the 
original data submitter (the transferor);
    (2) The name, address and state of incorporation (if any) of the 
person to whom the data rights are being transferred (the transferee);
    (3) Identification of each item of data transferred including:
    (i) The name of the study or item of data;
    (ii) Whether the study is an exclusive use study, and, if so, when 
the period of exclusive use protection expires;
    (iii) The name of the person or laboratory that conducted the study;

[[Page 25]]

    (iv) The date the study was submitted to the Agency;
    (v) The EPA document number assigned to the item of data (the Master 
Record Identification Number or Accession Number), if known. If not 
known, the EPA administrative number (such as the EPA Registration 
Number, petition number, file symbol, or permit number) with which the 
item of data was submitted, such that the Agency can identify the item 
of data.
    (vi) A statement that the transferor transfers irrevocably to the 
transferee all rights, titles, and interest in the items of data named;
    (vii) A statement that the transferor and transferee understand that 
any false statement may be punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001; and
    (viii) The names, signatures and titles of the transferor and 
transferee, and the date signed.
    (b) In addition, the original data submitter must submit to the 
Agency a notarized statement affirming that:
    (1) The person signing the transfer agreement is authorized by the 
original data submitter to bind the data submitter;
    (2) No court order prohibits the transfer, and any required court 
approvals have been obtained; and
    (3) The transfer is authorized under Federal, State, and local law 
and relevant corporate charters, bylaws or partnership agreements.
    (c) The Agency will acknowledge the transfer of the data by 
notifying both transferor and transferee, and will state the effective 
date of the transfer. Thereafter the transferee will be considered to be 
the original data submitter of the items of data transferred for all 
purposes under FIFRA section 3(c)(1)(F), unless a new transfer agreement 
is submitted to the Agency.

<R05>
Sec. 152.99  Petitions to cancel registration.

    An original data submitter may petition the Agency to deny or cancel 
the registration of a product in accordance with this section if he has 
submitted to the Agency a valid study which, he claims, satisfies a data 
requirement that an applicant purportedly has failed to satisfy.
    (a) Grounds for petition. (1) If an applicant has offered to pay 
compensation to an original data submitter of a study (either 
specifically or by filing a general offer to pay statement), the 
original data submitter may petition the Agency to deny or cancel the 
registration to which the offer related on any of the following grounds:
    (i) The applicant has failed to participate in an agreed-upon 
procedure for reaching an agreement on the amount and terms of 
compensation. The petitioner shall submit a copy of the agreed-upon 
procedure and describe the applicant's failure to participate in the 
procedure.
    (ii) The applicant has failed to comply with the terms of an 
agreement on compensation. The petitioner shall submit a copy of the 
agreement, and shall describe how the applicant has failed to comply 
with the agreement.
    (iii) The applicant has failed to participate in an arbitration 
proceeding. The petitioner shall submit evidence of such failure.
    (iv) The applicant has failed to comply with the terms of an 
arbitration decision. The petitioner shall submit a copy of the 
arbitration decision, and describe how the applicant has failed to 
comply with the decision.
    (2) When no offer to pay has been made, the petitioner shall state 
in his petition the basis for the challenge, and describe how the 
failure of the applicant to comply with the procedures of this subpart 
has deprived him of the rights accorded him under FIFRA section 
3(c)(1)(F). Possible grounds for challenge include, but are not limited 
to, the following:
    (i) The applicant has failed to list a data requirement applicable 
to his product, or has failed to demonstrate compliance with all 
applicable data requirements.
    (ii) The applicant has submitted or cited a study that is not valid.
    (iii) The applicant has submitted or cited a study that does not 
satisfy the data requirement for which it was submitted or cited.
    (iv) The applicant has failed to comply with the procedure for 
showing that a data gap exists.

[[Page 26]]

    (v) The applicant has improperly certified that a data gap exists. 
An original data submitter who has failed without good cause to respond 
to an applicant's request for confirmation of a data gap may not 
petition the Agency for review on this basis.
    (vi) The applicant has submitted or cited a study originally 
submitted by the petitioner, without the required authorization or offer 
to pay.
    (b) Procedure for petition to the Agency--(1) Time for filing. A 
petition under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be filed at any time 
that the circumstances warrant. A petition under paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section must be filed within one year after the Agency makes public 
the issuance of the registration.
    (2) Notice to affected registrant. At the same time that the 
petitioner files his petition with the Agency, he shall send a copy by 
certified mail to the affected applicant or registrant. The applicant or 
registrant shall have 60 days from the date of his receipt of the 
petition to submit written comments to the Agency.
    (c) Disposition of petitions. The Agency will consider the material 
submitted by the petitioner and the response, if any, by the affected 
applicant or registrant.
    (1) If the Agency determines that the petition is without merit, it 
will inform the petitioner and the affected applicant or registrant that 
the petition is denied. Denial of a petition is a final Agency action.
    (2) If the Agency determines that an applicant has acted in any way 
described by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Agency will notify 
the petitioner and the affected applicant or registrant that it intends 
to deny or cancel the registration of the product in support of which 
the data were cited. The affected applicant or registrant will have 15 
days from the date of delivery of this notice to respond. If the Agency 
determines, after considering any response, that the affected applicant 
or registrant has acted in the ways described by paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section, the Agency will deny or cancel the registration without 
further hearing. Refer to FIFRA section 3(c)(1)(F)(ii). Denial or 
cancellation of a registration is a final Agency action.
    (3) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if the 
Agency determines that an applicant for registration of a product has 
acted in any way that deprives an original data submitter of rights 
under FIFRA section 3(c)(1)(F), the Agency will take steps to deny the 
application or cancel the registration, as appropriate. The procedures 
in FIFRA section 3(c)(6) or section 6(b) shall be followed. Denial or 
cancellation is a final Agency action.
    (d) Hearing. Any hearing will be conducted in accordance with the 
procedures in 40 CFR part 164. The only matter for resolution at the 
hearing shall be whether the registrant failed to comply with the 
requirements and procedures of FIFRA section 3(c)(1)(F) or of this 
subpart, in the manner described by the petitioner. A decision following 
a hearing shall be final.

<R05>
Sec. 152.100  Scope.

    (a) The Agency will follow the procedures in this subpart for all 
applications for registration, except an application for registration of 
a pesticide that has been the subject of a previous Agency cancellation 
or suspension notice under FIFRA sec. 6.
    (b) The Agency will follow the procedures of subpart D of part 164 
of this chapter in evaluating any application for registration of a 
pesticide involving use of the pesticide in a manner that is prohibited 
by a suspension or cancellation order, to the extent required by subpart 
D of part 164.


<R05>
Sec. 152.102  Publication.

    The Agency will issue in the Federal Register a notice of receipt of 
each application for registration of a product that contains a new 
active ingredient or that proposes a new use. After registration of the 
product, the Agency will issue in the Federal Register a

[[Page 27]]

notice of issuance. The notice of issuance will describe the new 
chemical or new use, summarize the Agency's regulatory conclusions, list 
missing data and the conditions for their submission, and respond to 
comments received on the notice of application.


<R05>
Sec. 152.104  Completeness of applications.

    The applicant is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of 
all information submitted in connection with the application. The Agency 
will review each application to determine whether it is complete. An 
application is incomplete if any pertinent item specified in Sec. 
152.50 has not been submitted, or has been incorrectly submitted (for 
example, data required by part 158, or part 161 of this chapter, as 
applicable, and not submitted in accordance with the requirements for 
format, claims of confidential business information, or flagging).

[72 FR 61028, Oct. 26, 2007


<R05>
Sec. 152.105  Incomplete applications.

    The Agency will not begin or continue the review of an application 
that is incomplete. If the Agency determines that an application is 
incomplete or that further information is needed in order to complete 
the Agency's review, the Agency will notify the applicant of the 
deficiencies and allow the applicant 75 days to make corrections or 
additions to complete the application. If the applicant believes that 
the deficiencies cannot be corrected within 75 days, he must notify the 
Agency within those 75 days of the date on which he expects to complete 
the application. If, after 75 days, the applicant has not responded, or 
if the applicant subsequently fails to complete the application within 
the time scheduled for completion, the Agency will terminate any action 
on such application, and will treat the application as if it had been 
withdrawn by the applicant. Any subsequent submission relating to the 
same product must be submitted as a new application.


<R05>
Sec. 152.107  Review of data.

    (a) The Agency normally will review data submitted with an 
application that have not previously been submitted to the Agency.
    (b) The Agency normally will review other data submitted or cited by 
an applicant only:
    (1) As part of the process of reregistering currently registered 
products;
    (2) When acting on an application for registration of a product 
containing a new active ingredient;
    (3) If such data have been flagged in accordance with Sec. 158.34 
or 161.34 of this chapter; or
    (4) When the Agency determines that it would otherwise serve the 
public interest.
    (c) If the Agency finds that it needs additional data in order to 
determine whether the product may be registered, it will notify the 
applicant as early as possible in the review process.

<R05>
Sec. 152.108  Review of labeling.

    The Agency will review all draft labeling submitted with the 
application. If an applicant for amended registration submits only that 
portion of the labeling proposed for amendment, the Agency may review 
the entire label, as revised by the proposed changes, in deciding 
whether to approve the amendment. The Agency will not approve final 
printed labeling, but will selectively review it for compliance.


<R05>
Sec. 152.110  Time for agency review.

    The Agency will complete its review of applications as expeditiously 
as possible. Applications subject to specific timeframes under the fee 
schedule established by FIFRA section 33 will be reviewed within the 
timeframes established for the application or action type.

[73 FR 75595, Dec. 12, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 152.111  Choice of standards for review of applications.

    The Agency has discretion to review applications under either the 
unconditional registration criteria of FIFRA sec. 3(c)(5) or the 
conditional registration criteria of FIFRA sec. 3(c)(7). The type of 
review chosen depends primarily on the extent to which the relevant data 
base has been reviewed for

[[Page 28]]

completeness and scientific validity. EPA conducts data reviews needed 
to support unconditional registrations on a chemical-by-chemical basis, 
according to an established priority list. Except for applications for 
registration of a new active ingredient or in special cases where it 
finds immediate review to be warranted, the Agency will not commence a 
complete review of the existing data base on a given chemical in 
response to receipt of an application for registration. Instead the 
Agency will review the application using the criteria for conditional 
registration in FIFRA sec. 3(c)(7) (A) and (B).


<R05>
Sec. 152.112  Approval of registration under FIFRA sec. 3(c)(5).

    EPA will approve an application under the criteria of FIFRA sec. 
3(c)(5) only if:
    (a) The Agency has determined that the application is complete and 
is accompanied by all materials required by the Act and this part, 
including, but not limited to, evidence of compliance with subpart E of 
this part;
    (b) The Agency has reviewed all relevant data in the possession of 
the Agency (see Sec. Sec. 152.107 and 152.111);
    (c) The Agency has determined that no additional data are necessary 
to make the determinations required by FIFRA sec. 3(c)(5) with respect 
to the pesticide product which is the subject of the application;
    (d) The Agency has determined that the composition of the product is 
such as to warrant the proposed efficacy claims for it, if efficacy data 
are required to be submitted for the product by part 158 or part 161 of 
this chapter, as applicable.
    (e) The Agency has determined that the product will perform its 
intended function without unreasonable adverse effects on the 
environment, and that, when used in accordance with widespread and 
commonly recognized practice, the product will not generally cause 
unreasonable adverse effects on the environment;
    (f) The Agency has determined that the product is not misbranded as 
that term is defined in FIFRA sec. 2(q) and part 156 of this chapter, 
and its labeling and packaging comply with the applicable requirements 
of the Act, this part, and parts 156 and 157 of this chapter;
    (g) If the proposed labeling bears directions for use on food, 
animal feed, or food or feed crops, or if the intended use of the 
pesticide results or may reasonably be expected to result, directly or 
indirectly, in pesticide residues (including residues of any active or 
inert ingredient of the product, or of any metabolite or degradation 
product thereof) in or on food or animal feed, all necessary tolerances, 
exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance, and food additive 
regulations have been issued under FFDCA sec. 408, and
    (h) If the product, in addition to being a pesticide, is a drug 
within the meaning of FFDCA sec. 201(q), the Agency has been notified by 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that the product complies with 
any requirements imposed by FDA.

<R05>
Sec. 152.113  Approval of registration under FIFRA sec. 3(c)(7)--Products 

that do not contain a new active ingredient.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the Agency 
may approve an application for registration or amended registration of a 
pesticide product, each of whose active ingredients is contained in one 
or more other registered peticide products, only if the Agency has 
determined that:
    (1) It possesses all data necessary to make the determinations 
required by FIFRA sec. 3(c)(7)(A) or (B) with respect to the pesticide 
product which is the subject of the application (including, at a 
minimum, data needed to characterize any incremental risk that would 
result from approval of the application);
    (2) Approval of the application would not significantly increase the 
risk of any unreasonable adverse effect on the environment; and
    (3) The criteria of Sec. 152.112(a), (d), and (f) through (h) have 
been satisfied.
    (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, 
the Agency will not approve the conditional registration of any 
pesticide under FIFRA

[[Page 29]]

sec. 3(c)(7)(A) unless the Agency has determined that the applicant's 
product and its proposed use are identical or substantially similar to a 
currently registered pesticide and use, or that the pesticide and its 
proposed use differ only in ways that would not significantly increase 
the risk of unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.
    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, 
the Agency will not approve the conditional registration of any 
pesticide product for a new use under FIFRA sec. 3(c)(7)(B) if:
    (1) The pesticide is the subject of a special review, based on a use 
of the product that results in human dietary exposure; and
    (2) The proposed new use involves use on a major food or feed crop, 
or involves use on a minor food or feed crop for which there is 
available an effective alternative registered pesticide which does not 
meet the risk criteria associated with human dietary exposure. The 
determination of available and effective alternatives shall be made with 
the concurrence of the Secretary of Agriculture.


<R05>
Sec. 152.114  Approval of registration under FIFRA sec. 3(c)(7)--Products 

that contain a new active ingredient.

    An application for registration of a pesticide containing an active 
ingredient not in any currently registered product may be conditionally 
approved for a period of time sufficient for the generation and 
submission of certain of the data necessary for a finding of 
registrability under FIFRA sec. 3(c)(5) if the Agency determines that:
    (a) Insufficient time has elapsed since the imposition of the data 
requirement for those data to have been developed;
    (b) All other required test data and materials have been submitted 
to the Agency;
    (c) The criteria in Sec. 152.112(a), (b), (d), and (f) through (h) 
have been satisfied;
    (d) The use of the pesticide product during the period of the 
conditional registration will not cause any unreasonable adverse effect 
on the environment; and
    (e) The registration of the pesticide product and its subsequent use 
during the period of the conditional registration are in the public 
interest.


<R05>
Sec. 152.115  Conditions of registration.

    (a) Substantially similar products and new uses. Each registration 
issued under Sec. 152.113 shall be conditioned upon the submission or 
citation by the registrant of all data which are required for 
unconditional registration of his product under FIFRA sec. 3(c)(5), but 
which have not yet been submitted, no later than the time such data are 
required to be submitted for similar pesticide products already 
registered. If a notice requiring submission of such data has been 
issued under FIFRA sec. 3(c)(2)(B) prior to the date of approval of the 
application, the applicant must submit or cite the data described by 
that notice at the time specified by that notice. The applicant must 
agree to these conditions before the application may be approved.
    (b) New active ingredients. Each registration issued under Sec. 
152.114 shall be conditioned upon the applicant's agreement to each of 
the following conditions:
    (1) The applicant will submit remaining required data (and interim 
reports if required) in accordance with a schedule approved by the 
Agency.
    (2) The registration will expire upon a date established by the 
Agency, if the registrant fails to submit data as required by the 
Agency. The expiration date will be established based upon the length of 
time necessary to generate and submit the required data. If the studies 
are submitted in a timely manner, the registration will be cancelled if 
the Agency determines, based on the data (alone, or in conjuction with 
other data), that the product or one or more of its uses meets or 
exceeds any of the risk criteria established by the Agency to initiate a 
special review. If the Agency so determines, it will issue to the 
registrant a Notice of Intent to Cancel under FIFRA sec. 6(e), and will 
specify any provisions for sale and distribution of existing stocks of 
the pesticide product.
    (3) The applicant will submit an annual report of the production of 
the product.

[[Page 30]]

    (c) Other conditions. The Agency may establish, on a case-by-case 
basis, other conditions applicable to registrations to be issued under 
FIFRA sec. 3(c)(7).
    (d) Cancellation if condition is not satisfied. If any condition of 
the registration of the product is not satisfied, or if the Agency 
determines that the registrant has failed to initiate or pursue 
appropriate action towards fulfillment of any condition, the Agency will 
issue a notice of intent to cancel under FIFRA sec. 6(e).

<R05>
Sec. 152.116  Notice of intent to register to original submitters of exclusive use data.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, at least 30 
days before registration of a product containing an active ingredient 
for which a previously submitted study is eligible for exclusive use 
under FIFRA sec. 3(c)(1)(F)(i), the Agency will notify the original 
submitter of the exclusive use study of the intended registration of the 
product. If requested by the exclusive use data submitter within 30 
days, the Agency will also provide the applicant's list of data 
requirements and method of demonstrating compliance with each data 
requirement.
    (b) Within 30 days after receipt of the Agency's notice, or of the 
applicant's list of data requirements, whichever is later, the exclusive 
use data submitter may challenge the issuance of the registration in 
accordance with the procedures in Sec. 152.99 (b) and (c). If the 
Agency finds that the challenge has merit, it will issue a notice of 
denial of the application. The applicant may then avail himself of the 
hearing procedures provided by FIFRA sec. 3(c)(6). If the Agency finds 
that the challenge is without merit, it will deny the petition and 
register the applicant's product. Denial of the petition is a final 
Agency action.
    (c) If an applicant has submitted to the Agency a certification from 
an exclusive use data submitter that he is aware of the applicant's 
application for registration, and does not object to the issuance of the 
registration, the Agency will not provide the 30-day notification 
described in paragraph (a) of this section to that exclusive use data 
submitter.

<R05>
Sec. 152.117  Notification to applicant.

    The Agency will notify the applicant of the approval of his 
application by a Notice of Registration for new registration, or by a 
letter in the case of an amended registration.


<R05>
Sec. 152.118  Denial of application.

    (a) Basis for denial. The Agency may deny an application for 
registration if the Agency determines that the pesticide product does 
not meet the criteria for registration under either FIFRA sec. 3(c)(5) 
or (7), as specified in Sec. Sec. 152.112 through 152.114.
    (b) Notification of applicant. If the Agency determines that an 
application should be denied, it will notify the applicant by certified 
letter. The letter will set forth the reasons and factual basis for the 
determination with conditions, if any, which must be fulfilled in order 
for the registration to be approved.
    (c) Opportunity for remedy by the applicant. The applicant will have 
30 days from the date of receipt of the certified letter to take the 
specified corrective action. During this time the applicant may request 
that his application be withdrawn.
    (d) Notice of denial. If the applicant fails to correct the 
deficiencies within the 30-day period, the Agency may issue a notice of 
denial, which will be published in the Federal Register, and which will 
set forth the reasons and the factual basis for the denial.
    (e) Hearing rights. Within 30 days following the publication of the 
notice of denial, an applicant, or any interested person with written 
authorization of the applicant, may request a hearing in accordance with 
FIFRA sec. 6(b). Hearings will be conducted in accordance with part 164 
of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 152.119  Availability of material in support of registration.

    (a) The information submitted to support a registration application 
shall be part of the official Agency file for that registration.

[[Page 31]]

    (b) Within 30 days after registration, the Agency will make 
available for public inspection, upon request, the materials required by 
subpart E to be submitted with an application. Materials that will be 
publicly available include an applicant's list of data requirements, the 
method used by the applicant to demonstrate compliance for each data 
requirement, and the applicant's citations of specific studies in the 
Agency's possession if applicable.
    (c) Except as provided by FIFRA sec. 10, within 30 days after 
registration, the data on which the Agency based its decision to 
register the product will be made available for public inspection, upon 
request, in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR part 2.

<R05>
Sec. 152.122  Currency of address of record and authorized agent.

    (a) The registrant must keep the Agency informed of his current name 
and address of record. If the Agency's good faith attempts to contact 
the registrant are not successful, the Agency will issue in the Federal 
Register a notice of intent to cancel all products of the registrant 
under FIFRA sec. 6(b). The registrant must respond within 30 days 
requesting that the registrations be maintained in effect, and providing 
his name and address of record. If no response is received, the 
cancellations will become effective at the end of 30 days without 
further notice to the registrant. The Agency may make provision for the 
sale and distribution of existing stocks of such products after the 
effective date of cancellation.
    (b) The registrant must also notify the Agency if he changes his 
authorized agent.


<R05>
Sec. 152.125  Submission of information pertaining to adverse effects.

    If at any time the registrant receives or becomes aware of any 
factual information regarding unreasonable adverse effects of the 
pesticide on the environment that has not previously been submitted to 
the Agency, the registrant shall, in accordance with FIFRA section 
6(a)(2) and the requirements of part 159, subpart D of this chapter, 
provide such information to the Agency, clearly identified as FIFRA 
6(a)(2) data.

[73 FR 75595, Dec. 12, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 152.130  Distribution under approved labeling.

    (a) A registrant may distribute or sell a registered product with 
the composition, packaging and labeling currently approved by the 
Agency.
    (b) A registrant may distribute or sell a product under labeling 
bearing any subset of the approved directions for use, provided that in 
limiting the uses listed on the label, no changes would be necessary in 
precautionary statements, use classification, or packaging of the 
product.
    (c) Normally, if the product labeling is amended on the initiative 
of the registrant, by submission of an application for amended 
registration, the registrant may distribute or sell under the previously 
approved labeling for a period of 18 months after approval of the 
revision, unless an order subsequently issued by the Agency under FIFRA 
sec. 6 or 13 provides otherwise. However, if paragraph (d) of this 
section applies to the registrant's product, the time frames established 
by the Agency in accordance with that paragraph shall take precedence.
    (d) If a product's labeling is required to be revised as a result of 
the issuance of a Registration Standard, a Label Improvement Program 
notice, or a notice concluding a special review process, the Agency will 
specify in the notice to the registrant the period of time that 
previously approved labeling may be used. In all cases, supplemental or 
sticker labeling may be used as an interim compliance measure for a 
reasonable period of time. The Agency may establish dates as follows 
governing when label changes must appear on labels:
    (1) The Agency may establish a date after which all product 
distributed or sold by the registrant must bear revised labeling.
    (2) The Agency may also establish a date after which no product may 
be

[[Page 32]]

distributed or sold by any person unless it bears revised labeling. This 
date will provide sufficient time for product in channels of trade to be 
distributed or sold to users or otherwise disposed of.


<R05>
Sec. 152.132  Supplemental distribution.

    The registrant may distribute or sell his registered product under 
another person's name and address instead of (or in addition to) his 
own. Such distribution and sale is termed ``supplemental distribution'' 
and the product is referred to as a ``distributor product.'' The 
distributor is considered an agent of the registrant for all intents and 
purposes under the Act, and both the registrant and the distributor may 
be held liable for violations pertaining to the distributor product. 
Supplemental distribution is permitted upon notification to the Agency 
if all the following conditions are met:
    (a) The registrant has submitted to the Agency for each distributor 
product a statement signed by both the registrant and the distributor 
listing the names and addresses of the registrant and the distributor, 
the distributor's company number, the additional brand name(s) to be 
used, and the registration number of the registered product.
    (b) The distributor product is produced, packaged and labeled in a 
registered establishment operated by the same producer (or under 
contract in accordance with Sec. 152.30) who produces, packages, and 
labels the registered product.
    (c) The distributor product is not repackaged (remains in the 
producer's unopened container).
    (d) The label of the distributor product is the same as that of the 
registered product, except that:
    (1) The product name of the distributor product may be different 
(but may not be misleading);
    (2) The name and address of the distributor may appear instead of 
that of the registrant;
    (3) The registration number of the registered product must be 
followed by a dash, followed by the distributor's company number 
(obtainable from the Agency upon request);
    (4) The establishment number must be that of the final establishment 
at which the product was produced; and
    (5) Specific claims may be deleted, provided that no other changes 
are necessary.
    (e) Voluntary cancellation of a product applies to the registered 
product and all distributor products distributed or sold under that 
registration number. The registrant is responsible for ensuring that 
distributors under his cancelled registration are notified and comply 
with the terms of the cancellation.

<R05>
Sec. 152.135  Transfer of registration.

    (a) A registrant may transfer the registration of a product to 
another person, and the registered product may be distributed and sold 
without the requirement of a new application for registration by that 
other person, if the parties submit to the Agency the documents listed 
in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, and receive Agency approval 
as described in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) Persons seeking approval of a transfer of registration must 
provide a document signed by the authorized representative of the 
registrant (the transferor) and of the person to whom the registration 
is transferred (the transferee) that contains the following information:
    (1) The name, address and State of incorporation (if any) of the 
transferor;
    (2) The name, address and State of incorporation of the transferee;
    (3) The name(s) and EPA registration number(s) of the product(s) 
being transferred;
    (4) A statement that the transferor transfers irrevocably to the 
transferee all right, title, and interest in the EPA registration(s) 
listed in the document;
    (5) A statement that the transferred registration(s) shall not serve 
as collateral or otherwise secure any loan or other payment arrangement 
or executory promise, and that the registration(s) shall not revert to 
the transferor unless a new transfer agreement is submitted to and 
approved by the Agency;

[[Page 33]]

    (6) A description of the general nature of the underlying 
transaction, e.g., merger, spinoff, bankruptcy transfer (no financial 
information need be disclosed);
    (7) A statement that the transferor and transferee understand that 
any false statement may be punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001; and
    (8) An acknowledgment by the transferee that his rights and duties 
concerning the registration under FIFRA and this chapter will be deemed 
by EPA to be the same as those of the transferor at the time the 
transfer is approved.
    (c) In addition, the transferor must submit to the Agency a 
notarized statement affirming that:
    (1) The person signing the transfer agreement is authorized by the 
registrant to bind the transferor;
    (2) No court order prohibits the transfer, and that any required 
court approvals have been obtained; and
    (3) The transfer is authorized under all relevant Federal, State and 
local laws and all relevant corporate charters, bylaws, partnerships, or 
other agreements.
    (d) If the required documents are submitted, and no information 
available to the Agency indicates that the information is incorrect, the 
Agency will approve the transfer without requiring that the transferee 
obtain a new registration. The Agency will notify the transferor and 
transferee of its approval.
    (e) The transfer will be effective on the date of Agency approval. 
Thereafter the transferee will be regarded as the registrant for all 
purposes under FIFRA.
    (f) Rights to exclusive use of data or compensation under FIFRA 
section 3(c)(1)(F) are separate from the registration itself and may be 
retained by the transferor, or may be transferred independently in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 152.98. If the registrant as the 
original data submitter wishes to transfer data rights at the same time 
as he transfers the registration, he may submit a single transfer 
document containing the information required by this section for both 
the registration and the data.

Subpart H [Reserved]


<R04>
                 Subpart I_Classification of Pesticides

    Source: 53 FR 15986, May 4, 1988, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 152.160  Scope.

    (a) Types of classification. A pesticide product may be 
unclassified, or it may be classified for restricted use or for general 
use. The Agency does not normally classify products for general use; 
products that are not restricted remain unclassified.
    (b) Kinds of restrictions. The Agency may restrict a product or its 
uses to use by a certified applicator, or by or under the direct 
supervision of a certified applicator, as described in FIFRA sec. 
3(d)(1)(C). The Agency may also, by regulation, prescribe restrictions 
relating to the product's composition, labeling, packaging, uses, or 
distribution and sale, or to the status or qualifications of the user.


<R05>
Sec. 152.161  Definitions.

    In addition to the definitions in Sec. 152.3, the following terms 
are defined for the purposes of this subpart:
    (a) Dietary LC<INF>50</INF> means a statistically derived estimate 
of the concentration of a test substance in the diet that would cause 50 
percent mortality to the test population under specified conditions.
    (b) Outdoor use means any pesticide application that occurs outside 
enclosed manmade structures or the consequences of which extend beyond 
enclosed manmade structures, including, but not limited to, pulp and 
paper mill water treatments and industrial cooling water treatments.


<R05>
Sec. 152.164  Classification procedures.

    (a) Grouping of products for classification purposes. In its 
discretion, the Agency may identify a group of products having common 
characteristics or

[[Page 34]]

uses and may classify for restricted use same or all of the products or 
uses included in that group. Such a group may be comprised of, but is 
not limited to, products that:
    (1) Contain the same active ingredients.
    (2) Contain the same active ingredients in a particular 
concentration range, formulation type, or combination of concentration 
range and formulation type.
    (3) Have uses in common.
    (4) Have other characteristics, such as toxicity, flammability, or 
physical properties, in common.
    (b) Classification reviews. The Agency may conduct classification 
reviews and classify products at any time, if it determines that a 
restriction on the use of a pesticide product is necessary to avoid 
unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. However, classification 
reviews normally will be conducted and products classified only in the 
following circumstances:
    (1) As part of the review of an application for new registration of 
a product containing an active ingredient not contained in any currently 
registered product.
    (2) As part of the review of an application for a new use of a 
product, if existing uses of that product previously have been 
classified for restricted use. Review of a restricted use product at 
this time is for the purpose of determining whether the new use should 
also be classified for restricted use. Normally the Agency will not 
conduct initial classification reviews for existing uses of individual 
products in conjunction with an application for amended registration.
    (3) As part of the process of developing or amending a registration 
standard for a pesticide. The Agency normally will conduct 
classification reviews of all uses of a currently registered pesticide 
at this time.
    (4) As part of any special review of a pesticide, in accordance with 
the procedures of 40 CFR part 154.
    (c) Classification procedures. (1) If the Agency determines that a 
product or one or more of its uses should be classified for restricted 
use, the Agency initially may classify the product by regulation. In 
this case, within 60 days after the effective date of a final rule, each 
registrant of a product subject to the rule must submit to the Agency 
one of the following, as directed in the final rule:
    (i) A copy of the amended label and any supplemental labeling to be 
used as an interim compliance measure.
    (ii) A statement, which the Agency considers a report under the Act, 
that the registrant will comply with the labeling requirements 
prescribed by the Agency within the timeframes prescribed by the 
regulation.
    (iii) An application for amended registration to delete the uses 
which have been restricted, or to ``split'' the registration into two 
registrations, one including only restricted or all uses, and the other 
including only uses that have not been classified.
    (2) Alternatively, EPA may notify the applicant or registrant of the 
classification decision and require that he submit the information 
required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The Agency may deny

Sec. 152.166  Labeling of restricted use products.

    (a) Products intended for end use. A product whose labeling bears 
directions for end use and that has been classified for restricted use 
must be labeled in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 156.10 of 
this chapter or other Agency instructions. The Agency will permit the 
use of stickers or supplemental labeling as an interim alternative to 
the use of an approved amended label, in accordance with Sec. 152.167.
    (b) Products intended only for formulation. A product whose labeling 
does not bear directions for end use (a product that is intended and 
labeled solely for further formulation into other pesticide products) is 
not subject to the labeling requirements of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 152.167  Distribution and sale of restricted use products.

    Unless modified by the Agency, the compliance dates in this section 
shall apply to restricted use products.

[[Page 35]]

    (a) Sale by registrant or producer. (1) No product with a use 
classified for restricted use may be distributed or sold by the 
registrant or producer after the 120th day after the effective date of 
such classification unless the product:
    (i) Bears an approved amended label which contains the terms of 
restricted use imposed by the Agency and otherwise complies with part 
156 of this chapter;
    (ii) Bears a sticker containing the product name, EPA registration 
number, and any terms of restricted use imposed by the Agency; or
    (iii) Is accompanied by supplemental labeling bearing the 
information listed in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (2) If the registrant chooses to delete the restricted uses from his 
product label, that product may not be distributed or sold after the 
180th day after the effective date of classification unless the product 
bears amended labeling with the restricted uses deleted.
    (3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section, 
after the 270th day after the effective date of classification, no 
registrant or producer may distribute or sell a product that does not 
bear the approved amended label. After that date, stickers and 
supplemental labeling described in paragraph (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) are 
no longer acceptable.
    (b) Sale by retailer. No product with a use classified for 
restricted use by a regulation may be distributed or sold by a retailer 
or other person after the 270th day after the effective date of the 
final rule unless the product bears a label or labeling which complies 
with paragraph (a)(1) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 152.168  Advertising of restricted use products.

    (a) Any product classified for restricted use shall not be 
advertised unless the advertisement contains a statement of its 
restricted use classification.
    (b) The requirement in paragraph (a) of this section applies to all 
advertisements of the product, including, but not limited, to:
    (1) Brochures, pamphlets, circulars and similar material offered to 
purchasers at the point of sale or by direct mail.
    (2) Newspapers, magazines, newsletters and other material in 
circulation or available to the public.
    (3) Broadcast media such as radio and television.
    (4) Telephone advertising.
    (5) Billboards and posters.
    (c) The requirement may be satisfied for printed material by 
inclusion of the statement ``Restricted Use Pesticide,'' or the terms of 
restriction, prominently in the advertisement. The requirement may be 
satisfied with respect to broadcast or telephone advertising by 
inclusion in the broadcast of the spoken words ``Restricted use 
pesticide,'' or a statement of the terms of restriction.
    (d) The requirements of this section shall be effective:
    (1) After 270 days after the effective date of restriction of a 
product that is currently registered, unless the Agency specifies a 
shorter time period;
    (2) Upon the effective date of registration of a product not 
currently registered.


<R05>
Sec. 152.170  Criteria for restriction to use by certified applicators.

    (a) General criteria. An end-use product will be restricted to use 
by certified applicators (or persons under their direct supervision) if 
the Agency determines that:
    (1) Its toxicity exceeds one or more of the specific hazard criteria 
in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, or evidence described in 
paragraph (d) of this section substantiates that the product or use 
poses a serious hazard that may be mitigated by restricting its use;
    (2) Its labeling, when considered according to the factors in 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section, is not adequate to mitigate these 
hazard(s);
    (3) Restriction of the product would decrease the risk of adverse 
effects; and
    (4) The decrease in risks of the pesticide as a result of 
restriction would exceed the decrease in benefits.
    (b) Criteria for human hazard--(1) Residential and institutional 
uses. A pesticide product intended for residential or institutional use 
will be considered for restricted use classification if:

[[Page 36]]

    (i) The pesticide, as diluted for use, has an acute oral 
LD<INF>50</INF> of 1.5 g/kg or less;
    (ii) The pesticide, as formulated, has an acute dermal 
LD<INF>50</INF> of 2000 mg/kg or less;
    (iii) The pesticide, as formulated, has an acute inhalation 
LC<INF>50</INF> of 0.5 mg/liter or less, based upon a 4-hour exposure 
period;
    (iv) The pesticide, as formulated, is corrosive to the eye (causes 
irreversible destruction of ocular tissue) or results in corneal 
involvement or irritation persisting for more than 7 days;
    (v) The pesticide, as formulated, is corrosive to the skin (causes 
tissue destruction into the dermis and/or scarring) or causes severe 
irritation (severe erythema or edema) at 72 hours; or
    (vi) When used in accordance with label directions, or widespread 
and commonly recognized practice, the pesticide may cause significant 
subchronic, chronic or delayed toxic effects on man as a result of 
single or multiple exposures to the product ingredients or residues.
    (2) All other uses. A pesticide product intended for uses other than 
residential or institutional use will be considered for restricted use 
classification if:
    (i) The pesticide, as formulated, has an acute oral LD<INF>50</INF> 
of 50 mg/kg or less;
    (ii) The pesticide, as formulated, has an acute dermal 
LD<INF>50</INF> of 200 mg/kg or less;
    (iii) The pesticide, as diluted for use, has an acute dermal 
LD<INF>50</INF> of 16 g/kg or less;
    (iv) The pesticide, as formulated, has an acute inhalation 
LC<INF>50</INF> of 0.05 mg/liter or less, based upon a 4-hour exposure 
period;
    (v) The pesticide, as formulated, is corrosive to the eye or causes 
corneal involvement or irritation persisting for more than 21 days;
    (vi) The pesticide, as formulated, is corrosive to the skin (causes 
tissue destruction into the dermis and/or scarring); or
    (vii) When used in accordance with label directions, or widespread 
and commonly recognized practice, the pesticide may cause significant 
subchronic toxicity, chronic toxicity, or delayed toxic effects on man, 
as a result of single or multiple exposures to the product ingredients 
or residues.
    (c) Criteria for hazard to non-target species--(1) All products. A 
pesticide product intended for outdoor use will be considered for 
restricted use classification if:
    (i) When used according to label directions, application results in 
residues of the pesticide, its metabolites, or its degradation products, 
in the diet of exposed mammalian wildlife, immediately after 
application, such that:
    (A) The level of such residues equals or exceeds one-fifth of the 
acute dietary LC<INF>50</INF>; or
    (B) The amount of pesticide consumed in one feeding day (mg/kg/day) 
equals or exceeds one-fifth of the mammalian acute oral LD<INF>50</INF>;
    (ii) When used according to label directions, application results, 
immediately after application, in residues of the pesticide, its 
metabolites or its degradation products, in the diet of exposed birds at 
levels that equal or exceed one-fifth of the avian subacute dietary 
LC<INF>50</INF>;
    (iii) When used according to label directions, application results 
in residues of the pesticide, its metabolites or its degradation 
products, in water that equal or exceed one-tenth of the acute 
LC<INF>50</INF> for non-target aquatic organisms likely to be exposed; 
or
    (iv) Under conditions of label use or widespread and commonly 
recognized practice, the pesticide may cause discernible adverse effects 
on non-target organisms, such as significant mortality or effects on the 
physiology, growth, population levels or reproduction rates of such 
organisms, resulting from direct or indirect exposure to the pesticide, 
its metabolites or its degradation products.
    (2) Granular products. In addition to the criteria of paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, a pesticide intended for outdoor use and 
formulated as a granular product will be considered for restricted use 
classification if:
    (i) The formulated product has an acute avian or mammalian oral 
LD<INF>50</INF> of 50 mg/kg or less as determined by extrapolation from 
tests conducted with technical material or directly with the formulated 
product; and

[[Page 37]]

    (ii) It is intended to be applied in such a manner that significant 
exposure to birds or mammals may occur.
    (d) Other evidence. The Agency may also consider evidence such as 
field studies, use history, accident data, monitoring data, or other 
pertinent evidence in deciding whether the product or use may pose a 
serious hazard to man or the environment that can reasonably be 
mitigated by restricted use classification.
    (e) Alternative labeling language. (1) If the Agency determines that 
a product meets one or more of the criteria of paragraphs (b) or (c) of 
this section, or if other evidence identified in paragraph (d) of this 
section leads the Agency to conclude that the product should be 
considered for restricted use classification, the Agency will then 
determine if additional labeling language would be adequate to mitigate 
the identified hazard(s) without restricted use classification. If the 
labeling language meets all the criteria specified in paragraph (e)(2) 
of this section, the product will not be classified for restricted use.
    (2) The labeling will be judged adequate if it meets all the 
following criteria:
    (i) The user, in order to follow label directions, would not be 
required to perform complex operations or procedures requiring 
specialized training and/or experience.
    (ii) The label directions do not call for specialized apparatus, 
protective equipment, or materials that reasonably would not be 
available to the general public.
    (iii) Failure to follow label directions in a minor way would result 
in few or no significant adverse effects.
    (iv) Following directions for use would result in few or no 
significant adverse effects of a delayed or indirect nature through 
bioaccumulation, persistence, or pesticide movement from the original 
application site.
    (v) Widespread and commonly recognized practices of use would not 
nullify or detract from label directions such that unreasonable adverse 
effects on the environment might occur.


<R05>
Sec. 152.171  Restrictions other than those relating to use by certified applicators.

    The Agency may by regulation impose restrictions on a product or 
class of products if it determines that:
    (a) Without such restrictions, the product when used in accordance 
with warnings, cautions and directions for use or in accordance with 
widespread and commonly recognized practices of use may cause 
unreasonable adverse effects on the environment; and
    (b) The decrease in risks as a result of restricted use would exceed 
the decrease in benefits as a result of restricted use.


<R05>
Sec. 152.175  Pesticides classified for restricted use.

    The following uses of pesticide products containing the active 
ingredients specified below have been classified for restricted use and 
are limited to use by or under the direct supervision of a certified 
applicator.

<R05>
Sec. 152.400  Purpose.

    Subpart U prescribes fees to be charged for the pesticide regulatory 
activities set forth in Sec. 152.403 as performed by the Environmental 
Protection Agency (as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 9701 and Pub. L. 100-202) 
and provisions regarding their payment.


<R05>
Sec. 152.401  Inapplicability of fee provisions to applications filed prior to October 1, 1997.

    No fee required by this subpart U shall be levied with respect to 
any application filed during the period beginning on October 25, 1988, 
and ending on September 30, 1997. See FIFRA section 4(i)(7) (added to 
FIFRA by Pub. L. 100-532, October 25, 1988, 102 Stat. 2654).

<R05>
Sec. 152.403  Definitions of fee categories.

    (a) New chemical registration review means review of an application 
for registration of a pesticide product containing a chemical active 
ingredient which is not contained as an active ingredient in any other 
pesticide product

[[Page 41]]

that is registered under FIFRA at the time the application is made.
    (b) New biochemical and microbial registration review means review 
of an application for registration of a biochemical or microbial 
pesticide product containing a biochemical or microbial active 
ingredient not contained in any other pesticide product that is 
registered under FIFRA at the time the application is made. For purposes 
of this subpart, the definitions of biochemical and microbial pesticides 
contained in Sec. 158.2000 and Sec. 158.2100, respectively, shall 
apply.
    (c) New use pattern registration review means review of an 
application for registration, or for amendment of a registration 
entailing a major change to the use pattern of an active ingredient 
contained in a product registered under FIFRA or pending Agency decision 
on a prior application at the time of application. For purposes of this 
paragraph, examples of major changes include but are not limited to, 
changes from non-food to food use, outdoor to indoor use, ground to 
aerial application, terrestrial to aquatic use, and non-residential to 
residential use.
    (d) Old chemical registration review means review of an application 
for registration of a new product containing active ingredients and uses 
which are substantially similar or identical to those currently 
registered or for which an application is pending Agency decision.
    (e) Amendment review means review of any application requiring 
Agency approval to amend the registration of a currently registered 
product, or for which an application is pending Agency decision, not 
entailing a major change to the use pattern of an active ingredient.
    (f) Experimental use permit review means review of an application 
for a permit pursuant to section 5 of FIFRA to apply a limited quantity 
of a pesticide in order to accumulate information necessary to register 
the pesticide. The application may be for a new chemical or for a new 
use of an old chemical. The fee applies to such experimental uses of a 
single unregistered active ingredient (no limit on the number of other 
active ingredients, in a tank mix, already registered for the crops 
involved) and no more than three crops. This fee does not apply to 
experimental use permits required for small-scale field testing of 
microbial pest control agents (40 CFR 172.3).

<R05>
Sec. 152.406  Submission of supplementary data.

    Applicants may submit data to supplement pending applications 
without incurring additional charges if the proper fee was paid with 
submission of the original application and subsequent submissions of 
supplementary data do not constitute a change in the type of 
registration action requested.

[53 FR 19114, May 26, 1988, as amended at 58 FR 34203, June 23, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 152.408  Special considerations.

    (a) If two or more applicants apply for a new chemical registration 
for products having the same active ingredient and each applicant 
provides a set of data in support of the registration developed 
independently of the other applicants' data, then each applicant 
submitting an independent set of data shall be charged the full new 
chemical registration review fee.
    (b) If two or more applicants apply for a new chemical registration 
for products having the same active ingredient and the applicants have 
jointly

[[Page 42]]

developed or paid for the joint development of a common set of data to 
support their applications for registration, then each applicant shall 
be charged an equal share of the total fee for review of the 
applications for all of the subject products. The total fee will include 
the sum of the new chemical registration review fee for one product and 
one old chemical registration review fee for each additional product.
    (c) If an application is received for registration of a product that 
contains two or more new chemical active ingredients and a different set 
of generic data is required by the Agency for each new chemical for the 
purpose of registration, the applicant will be required to pay the full 
new chemical registration review fee for each active ingredient.


<R05>
Sec. 152.410  Adjustment of fees.

    (a) The fee schedule will be adjusted annually by the same 
percentage as the percent change in the Federal General Schedule (GS) 
pay scale. Such adjustments will be published in the Federal Register as 
a final rule and will be effective 30 days or more after promulgation.
    (b) Processing costs and fees will be reviewed periodically and 
changes will be made to the schedule as necessary. Such adjustments will 
be published for notice and comment in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 152.412  Waivers and refunds.

    (a) Refunds. If an application is not accepted for processing 
because it is incomplete, the fee, less $1,200 for handling and initial 
review (or the amount of the fee, whichever is less), shall be returned. 
If an application is withdrawn by the applicant before significant 
Agency scientific review has begun, the fee, less $1,200, shall be 
returned. If an unacceptable or withdrawn petition is resubmitted, it 
shall be accompanied by the fee that would be required if it were 
submitted for the first time.
    (b) Waiver of fees for activities initiated by the Agency. The 
Agency may waive fees for amended registrations where the amendment has 
been initiated solely by the Agency. The Agency retains sole discretion 
in determining when this fee will be waived. The announcement of the fee 
waiver will accompany the EPA request for an amendment. The Agency will 
not approve any individual requests for waivers of EPA-initiated 
activity fees.
    (c) Waiver of fees for activities initiated by applicants. Upon 
request by an applicant, together with the supporting documentation or 
justification described in this paragraph, the Agency may waive or 
refund fees in whole or in part. A request for waiver must be submitted 
in accordance with Sec. 152.414(a). An application for which a waiver 
of fees has been requested will not be accepted for review until the 
waiver has been granted, or until the waiver has been denied and 
thereafter the proper fee has been submitted.
    (1) Minor use. Fees may be waived for applications limited to minor 
uses that lack commercial feasibility for the pesticide applicant. An 
applicant requesting a waiver on this basis must provide supporting 
information that demonstrates that anticipated revenues from the uses 
that are the subject of the application would be insufficient to pay 
back the cost of the fee. The burden of proof of the reasonableness of 
this estimate rests with the applicant.
    (2) IR-4. Fees will be waived for registration actions that are 
determined to be specifically associated with tolerance petitions 
submitted by the Inter-Regional Research Project Number 4 (IR-4 program) 
when such waiver is deemed by the Agency to be in the public interest.
    (3) Severe economic impact. The Agency may waive two-thirds of any 
cumulative registration fee payment in a 12-month period following 
completion of the applicant's most recent fiscal year that exceeds 3 
percent of the applicant's pesticide sales in its most recently 
completed fiscal year. An applicant requesting a waiver on this basis 
must provide documentation (e.g. copy of an annual report, or income tax 
forms filed with the Internal Revenue Service, or if needed, a notarized 
statement signed by a corporate officer regarding annual pesticide 
sales) demonstrating that:
    (i) The company applying had less than $40 million in gross revenue 
(including all revenue sources) in the

[[Page 43]]

most recently concluded fiscal year of operation, and a single fee would 
constitute more than 3 percent of the applicant's gross revenue from 
pesticide sales in the most recently completed fiscal year of operation, 
or
    (ii) The company applying had less than $40 million in gross revenue 
(including all revenue sources) in the most recently concluded fiscal 
year of operation, and the cumulative registration fees paid during the 
12 months following the applicant's most recently completed fiscal year, 
including any registration fees paid for the applicant for which a 
waiver is requested, constitute more than 3 percent of the applicant's 
gross revenue from pesticide sales in the most recently concluded fiscal 
year of operation.
    (iii) The Agency will not grant such a waiver if it determines that 
the entity submitting the application has been formed or manipulated to 
qualify for such a waiver.
    (4) Public interest. The Agency, in its discretion, may waive in 
whole or in part any of the fees established herein in the public 
interest. Examples include, but are not limited to, pesticides offering 
unique advantages for reducing public health risks, those that 
significantly reduce a current environmental risk, or a product with 
extraordinary utility for use in Integrated Pest Management (IPM).

<R05>
Sec. 152.414  Procedures.

    (a) Procedures for requesting a waiver. (1) A request for a waiver 
must be submitted in writing at the time the application is submitted to 
the Office of Pesticide Programs' Document Processing Desk at the 
appropriate address as set forth in 40 CFR 150.17(a) or (b).
    (2) A payment of $1,200 for processing the waiver or the amount of 
the actual fee, whichever is less, must be submitted simultaneously to 
the address set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. This fee will be 
refunded (or applied to any resulting partial fee) if the waiver is 
granted. Payment of fees for the registration activities, in contrast to 
the waiver fee, shall not be required until the Agency makes a 
determination on the waiver request. Since the actual fee is submitted 
to an address different than the one to which the waiver request is 
submitted, a copy of the payment document must be submitted with the 
waiver request that is submitted to the Office of Pesticide Programs' 
Document Processing Desk as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section. No fee is required from a person who has no financial interest 
in the application.
    (b) Procedures for payment of fees. All fees required by this 
section must be paid by money order, bank draft, or certified check 
drawn to the order of the Environmental Protection Agency. All payment 
of fees must be forwarded to the Environmental Protection Agency, 
Headquarters Accounting Operations Branch, Office of Pesticide Programs 
(Registration Fees), P.O. Box 360277M, Pittsburgh, PA 15251. The 
payments should be specifically labeled ``Registration Fees'' and should 
be accompanied only by a copy of the registration application form or 
the experimental use permit application form, as appropriate. An 
application will not be accepted for processing until the required fees 
have been submitted.
    (c) Procedures for submitting application and supporting data. The 
application, along with supporting data, shall be forwarded within 30 
days of payment to the Washington DC address set forth in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 153.125  Criteria for determination of pesticidal activity.

    (a) An ingredient will be considered an active ingredient if it is 
contained in a pesticide product and:
    (1) The ingredient has the capability by itself, and when used as 
directed at the proposed use dilution, to function as a pesticide; or
    (2) The ingredient has the ability to elicit or enhance a pesticidal 
effect in another compound whose pesticidal activity is substantially 
increased due to the interaction of the compounds. Compounds which 
function simply to enhance or prolong the activity of an active 
ingredient by physical action, such as stickers and other adjuvants, are 
not generally considered to be active ingredients.
    (b) Normally the applicant will determine and state in his 
application whether an ingredient is active or inert with respect to 
pesticidal activity. The Agency, as part of its review of an application 
for registration, or in conjunction with the Registration Standard or 
Special Review process, may require any ingredient, to be designated as 
an active ingredient if the Agency finds that it meets the criteria in 
paragraph (a) of this section. Conversely, the Agency may determine that 
any ingredient designated as active by an applicant is an inert 
ingredient if it fails to meet those criteria.
    (c) If an ingredient is designated as an active ingredient, it must 
be identified in the label ingredients statement. If an ingredient is 
designated as an inert ingredient, it must be included as part of the 
total inert ingredients in the label ingredients statement.
    (d) Designation of a substance as a pesticidally inert ingredient 
does not relieve the applicant or registrant of other requirements of 
FIFRA with respect to labeling of inert ingredients or submission of 
data, or from the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug,

[[Page 45]]

and Cosmetic Act with respect to tolerances or other clearance of 
ingredients.

Sec. 153.155  Seed treatment products.

    (a) Pesticide products intended for use in treating seeds must 
contain an EPA-approved dye to impart an unnatural color to the seed, 
unless appropriate tolerances or other clearances have been established 
under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act for residues of the 
pesticide.
    (b) The following products are exempt from the requirement of 
paragraph (a) of this section:
    (1) Products intended and labeled for use solely by commercial seed 
treaters, provided that the label bears a statement requiring the user 
to add an EPA-approved dye with the pesticide during the seed treatment 
process.
    (2) Products intended and labeled for use solely as at-planting or 
hopper box treatments.
    (3) Products which are gaseous in form or are used as fumigants.
    (c) EPA-approved dyes for seed treatment are listed in:
    (1) Sections 180.910, 180.920, and 180.950 if an exemption from the 
requirement of a tolerance has been established.
    (2) Section 180.2010 if EPA has determined that residues of the dye 
will be present, if at all, at levels that are below the threshold of 
regulation.
    (3) Section 180.2020 if it has been determined that no tolerance or 
exemption from the requirement of a tolerance is needed as a result of a 
determination by EPA that the use is unlikely to result in residues in 
food/feed.

                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 154.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) Purpose. The purpose of the Special Review process is to help 
the Agency determine whether to initiate procedures to cancel, deny, or 
reclassify registration of a pesticide product because uses of that 
product may cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment, in 
accordance with sections 3(c)(6) and 6 of the Federal Insecticide,

[[Page 46]]

Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). The process is intended to 
ensure that the Agency assesses risks that may be posed by pesticides, 
and the benefits of use of those pesticides, in an open and responsive 
manner. The issuance of a Notice of Special Review means that the Agency 
has determined that one or more uses of a pesticide may pose significant 
risks and that, following completion of the Special Review process, the 
Agency expects to initiate formal proceedings seeking to cancel, deny, 
reclassify, or require modifications to the registration of the 
product(s) in question unless it has been shown during the Special 
Review that the Agency's initial determination was erroneous, that the 
risks can be reduced to acceptable levels without the need for formal 
proceedings, or that the benefits of the pesticide's use outweigh the 
risks. Following completion of the Special Review process, a pesticide 
in question may be returned to the registration process.
    (b) Scope. This part sets forth the substantive standards for 
initiating a Special Review of a pesticide product and the procedures 
for initiating and conducting the Special Review.


<R05>
Sec. 154.3  Definitions.

    Terms used in this part have the same meaning as in the Act. In 
addition, as used in this part, the following terms shall apply:
    Act or FIFRA means the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and 
Rodenticide Act, as amended.
    Administrator means the Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency or any officer or employee thereof to whom authority 
has been delegated to act for the Administrator.
    Confidential business information means trade secrets or 
confidential commercial or financial information under FIFRA section 
10(b) or 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3) or (4).
    Other significant evidence means factually significant information 
that relates to the uses of the pesticide and its adverse risk to man or 
to the environment but does not include evidence based only on misuse of 
the pesticide unless such misuse is widespread and commonly recognized 
practice.
    Person means an applicant, registrant, manufacturer, pesticide user, 
environmental group, labor union, or other individual or group of 
individuals interested in pesticide regulation.
    Pesticide use means a use of a pesticide (described in terms of the 
application site and other applicable identifying factors) that is 
included in the labeling of a pesticide product which is registered, or 
for which an application for registration is pending, and the terms and 
conditions (or proposed terms and conditions) of registration for the 
use.
    Terms and conditions of registration means the terms and conditions 
governing lawful sale, distribution, and use approved in conjunction 
with registration, including labeling, use classification, composition, 
and packaging.
    Validated test means a test determined by the Agency to have been 
conducted and evaluated in a manner consistent with accepted scientific 
procedures.

[73 FR 75595, Dec. 12, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 154.5  Burden of persuasion in determinations under this part.

    In making determinations under this part the Administrator shall be 
guided by the principle that the burden of persuasion that a pesticide 
product is entitled to registration or continued registration for any 
particular use or under any particular set of terms and conditions of 
registration is always on the proponent(s) of registration.


<R05>
Sec. 154.7  Criteria for initiation of Special Review.

    (a) The Administrator may conduct a Special Review of a pesticide 
use if he determines, based on a validated test or other significant 
evidence, that the use of the pesticide (taking into account the 
ingredients, impurities, metabolites, and degradation products of the 
pesticide):
    (1) May pose a risk of serious acute injury to humans or domestic 
animals.
    (2) May pose a risk of inducing in humans an oncogenic, heritable 
genetic, teratogenic, fetotoxic, reproductive effect, or a chronic or 
delayed toxic effect, which risk is of concern in terms

[[Page 47]]

of either the degree of risk to individual humans or the number of 
humans at some risk, based upon:
    (i) Effects demonstrated in humans or experimental animals.
    (ii) Known or predicted levels of exposure of various groups of 
humans.
    (iii) The use of appropriate methods of evaluating data and relating 
such data to human risk.
    (3) May result in residues in the environment of nontarget organisms 
at levels which equal or exceed concentrations acutely or chronically 
toxic to such organisms, or at levels which produce adverse reproductive 
effects in such organisms, as determined from tests conducted on 
representative species or from other appropriate data.
    (4) May pose a risk to the continued existence of any endangered or 
threatened species designated by the Secretary of the Interior or the 
Secretary of Commerce under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as 
amended.
    (5) May result in the destruction or other adverse modification of 
any habitat designated by the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary 
of Commerce under the Endangered Species Act as a critical habitat for 
any endangered or threatened species.
    (6) May otherwise pose a risk to humans or to the environment which 
is of sufficient magnitude to merit a determination whether the use of 
the pesticide product offers offsetting social, economic, and 
environmental benefits that justify initial or continued registration.
    (b) In making any determination that a pesticide use satisfies one 
of the criteria for issuance of a Special Review specified by paragraph 
(a) of this section, the Administrator shall consider available evidence 
concerning both the adverse effect in question and the magnitude and 
scope of exposure of humans and nontarget organisms associated with use 
of the pesticide.


<R05>
Sec. 154.10  Petitions to begin the Special Review process.

    The Administrator may evaluate a pesticide use under the criteria of 
Sec. 154.7 either on his own initiative, or at the suggestion of any 
interested person.


<R05>
Sec. 154.15  Docket for the Special Review.

    (a) Establishment of the docket. When the Agency first notifies 
registrants privately that it is considering issuance of a Notice of 
Special Review for a pesticide, it shall establish a docket concerning 
that particular pesticide.
    (b) Contents of the docket. For each pre-Special Review or Special 
Review, the docket shall contain:
    (1) The Notice of Special Review, any Notice of Preliminary 
Determination, and any Notice of Final Determination.
    (2) Any notice issued under Sec. 154.21 or Sec. 154.23.
    (3) Any documents (other than information claimed to be confidential 
business information) referred to by the Agency in those notices as 
relied upon by the Agency in reaching its determination.
    (4) Copies of all written comments or materials (other than 
information claimed to be confidential business information) responding 
to any notice furnished under Sec. 154.21 or Sec. 154.23 or submitted 
at any time during the Special Review process by any person outside of 
government.
    (5) Any written response to the Notice of Preliminary Determination 
from the Secretary of Agriculture or the Scientific Advisory Panel.
    (6) A transcript of all public meetings held by the Scientific 
Advisory Panel or conducted by the Agency for the purpose of gathering 
information.
    (7) A memorandum describing each meeting between Agency personnel 
and any person or party outside of government which concerns a pending 
pre-Special Review or Special Review decision. Each such memorandum 
shall be based on notes taken at the meeting and shall specify the date 
and time of the meeting, the participants and their affiliations, who 
requested the meeting, the subject matter of the meeting, and the person 
who prepared the memorandum. Except for information claimed to be 
confidential business information, each memorandum shall describe fully 
and accurately all significant positions taken, arguments made, and 
facts presented by each participant in the meeting, and shall identify 
all documents, proposals, or other materials distributed or exchanged at 
the

[[Page 48]]

meeting. Any discussion of claimed confidential business information 
shall be identified in meeting notes and referenced in the memorandum.
    (8) All comments, correspondence, or other materials concerning a 
pending pre-Special Review or Special Review decision provided to the 
Agency by a person or party outside of government (other than 
information claimed to be confidential business information).
    (9) All documents, proposals, or other materials concerning a 
pending pre-Special Review or Special Review decision, provided by the 
Agency to any person or party outside of government (other than 
information claimed to be confidential business information).
    (c) Assertion of confidential business information claims. (1) 
Information, comments, data, or other written material submitted to the 
Agency concerning a Special Review may be claimed by the submitter to be 
confidential business information. The burden of identifying claimed 
confidential business information rests with the submitter, or, in 
meetings, with the participants who wish to assert a claim of 
confidentiality.
    (2) To assert a claim of confidentiality for all or any part of a 
written submission concerning a Special Review, the submitter must 
furnish three copies of the material. Two copies must be complete, with 
claimed confidential business information clearly marked in the text. 
Items in the document that are claimed confidential should be numbered 
consecutively throughout the text. The third copy must have the claimed 
confidential business information excised from the text without closing 
up or paraphrasing the remaining text. The deletions should be 
consecutively numbered to correspond to the numbering of the complete 
copies. Each copy must be marked on the cover as to whether it contains 
claimed confidential business information.
    (3) Any written material concerning a Special Review received by the 
Agency that is not marked as confidential will be deemed to be 
nonconfidential, and may be made available through the public docket or 
otherwise disclosed without prior notice to the submitter.
    (d) Placement of materials in the docket. Any memorandum identified 
under paragraph (b)(7) of this section shall be placed in the docket 
within 10 working days of the subject meeting. Materials identified 
under paragraph (b)(8) of this section shall be placed in the docket 
within 10 working days of receipt by the Office of Pesticide Programs, 
or within 15 working days of receipt by the Office of Pesticide Programs 
if the submitter has asserted a confidential business information claim 
concerning the submittal. Materials identified under paragraph (b)(9) of 
this section shall be placed in the docket within 15 working days of 
transmittal to such person or party outside of government.
    (e) Index. The Agency shall prepare and maintain a current index of 
all materials included in the docket. The index will include a list 
identifying, for each meeting between Agency personnel and a person or 
party outside of government for which a memorandum has been prepared, 
the date, the subject, participants, and person who requested the 
meeting. The index will also list any document included in the docket by 
its title, its source, its recipient, and the date it was received or 
provided by the Agency.
    (f) Access to the docket. (1)(i) For each chemical in Special 
Review, the docket shall be available for public inspection and copying 
and its index kept current and made available to the public on request. 
The docket and index for any pesticide for which the Agency has issued a 
pre-Special Review notification under Sec. 154.21 will only be made 
available for public inspection and copying following issuance of a 
proposed decision not to start a Special Review under Sec. 154.23, a 
Notice of Special Review under Sec. 154.25(c), or as otherwise 
specified in Sec. 154.34.
    (ii) The docket and index will be available at the OPP Regulatory 
Public Docket located as set forth in 40 CFR 150.17(c).
    (2) Information contained in the docket shall not be disclosed to 
the public to the extent that FIFRA or any other statute or regulation 
(including, but not limited to, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3) or (4)) prohibits its 
disclosure.
    (3) The Agency will distribute a compendium of indices for new 
materials in

[[Page 49]]

the public docket by mail, on a monthly basis, to those members of the 
public who have specifically requested such material. The Agency will 
announce the availability of docket indices both annually in the Federal 
Register and in each Federal Register Notice concerning pre-Special 
Review or Special Review for specific pesticides. The Agency may also 
periodically require parties on the mailing list to renew their previous 
request for such materials.

Sec. 154.23  Proposed decision not to initiate a Special Review.

    If the Administrator proposes not to initiate a Special Review after 
having given notice under Sec. 154.21, he shall issue a proposed 
decision for publication in the Federal Register. The proposal shall 
include a description of the concerns which were the original basis for 
placement of the pesticide in pre-Special Review status and the Agency's 
rationale for its proposed decision, announce the availability of a 
public docket, and provide a period generally not less than 30 days for 
submission of comments. A notice under Sec. 154.25(b) may not be 
published unless it has been preceded by a notice under this section. A 
proposal under this section shall not be based on the benefits of use of 
a pesticide product.


<R05>
Sec. 154.25  Public announcement of final decision whether to initiate a Special Review.

    (a) The Administrator shall evaluate the available information and 
the comments received in response to the notice under Sec. 154.21 and 
any notice issued under Sec. 154.23, and shall issue for publication in 
the Federal Register a notice under paragraph (b) or (c) of this 
section.
    (b) If the Administrator determines after having given notice under 
Sec. 154.21 not to initiate a Special Review, he shall issue his 
decision for publication in the Federal Register with a statement of 
reasons.
    (c) If the Administrator determines after having given notice under 
Sec. 154.21 that one or more of the risk criteria set forth in Sec. 
154.7 have been satisfied, the Agency shall issue a notice for 
publication in the Federal Register which shall include:
    (1) Identification of the pesticide uses for which a Special Review 
has been initiated and an identification of the criteria which have been 
satisfied.
    (2) A brief discussion of the Agency's reasons for determining that 
the criteria have been satisfied.
    (3) A statement indicating that EPA has established a docket for the 
Special Review, the contents of the docket, the location of the docket, 
and the times during which the docket will be available for inspection 
and copying.
    (4) An invitation to all interested persons to submit further 
information concerning the risks and benefits associated with each use 
of the pesticide subject to the Special Review.
    (5) A brief description of the Special Review process and a 
statement that registrants and applicants bear an affirmative burden of 
supporting registration of a pesticide product.
    (6) A date by which information in response to the Agency's request 
for further information must be submitted.
    (d) In his discretion, the Administrator may request that the 
Scientific Advisory Panel hold a public meeting to review the scientific 
issues related to the Special Review.

[[Page 50]]


<R05>
Sec. 154.26  Comment opportunity.

    After issuance of a Notice of Special Review that applies to a use 
of a pesticide product (or category of products), any person may submit 
to the Agency any information, argument, or both, pertinent to:
    (a) Whether the use of a pesticide product satisfies any of the 
Sec. 154.7 risk criteria, with respect to the composition, labeling, 
packaging, and restrictions on use of the product as currently 
registered.
    (b) Whether the use of a pesticide product would satisfy any of the 
Sec. 154.7 risk criteria if its composition, labeling, packaging, and 
restrictions on use were approved in accordance with an application for 
registration or amended registration pending before the Agency. For 
further information see Sec. 154.27(b).
    (c) Whether any risks posed by the use or proposed use of the 
product that satisfy the Sec. 154.7 risk criteria are unreasonable, 
taking into account the economic, social, and environmental costs and 
benefits of the use of the product.
    (d) What regulatory action, if any, the Agency should take with 
respect to the use of the product.


<R05>
Sec. 154.27  Meetings with interested persons.

    (a) In the Special Review process, to assure openness and 
responsiveness, no person or party outside of government will be 
afforded special or preferential access to Agency Special Review 
decisionmakers or to the Agency's Special Review process. At the same 
time, however, Agency personnel are free to meet and otherwise 
communicate with persons or parties outside of government, including 
registrants and manufacturers, users, trade unions, environmental groups 
and other interested persons, to obtain information, exchange views, 
explore factual and substantive positions, or discuss regulatory options 
concerning Special Review decisions.
    (b) Meetings between EPA and any person or party outside of 
government will not result in undue delay in reaching Special Review 
decisions. During such meetings, the Agency will not commit to take any 
particular action concerning a pending decision. The Agency may receive 
and consider information and recommendations from persons or parties 
outside of government; however, the Agency will make the final 
administrative decision on a wholly independent basis and in accordance 
with law.
    (c) Any interested person may ask to meet with Agency officials to 
discuss factual information available to the Agency, to present any 
factual information, to respond to presentations by other persons, or to 
discuss what regulatory actions should be taken regarding a pesticide 
which is or may be the subject of a Special Review. If, at its 
discretion, the Agency holds such meetings with any person outside of 
government concerning a use of a pesticide product, the Agency will 
prepare and file in the docket a memorandum of such meeting, meeting the 
requirements specified in Sec. 154.15(b)(7).
    (d) Meetings described in this section may include meetings held 
after issuance of a Notice of Special Review with any registrant who 
proposes to change voluntarily the composition, packaging, and labeling, 
or other terms and conditions of registration of his pesticide product 
in a way which he believes would reduce the risks of use of the product 
so that it would no longer meet or exceed the risk criteria of Sec. 
154.7. Meetings for this purpose will be most helpful and productive for 
both registrants and the Agency if they are requested by registrants 
shortly after the issuance of the Notice of Special Review.
    (e) If the Agency meets with any person or party outside of 
government concerning a pending Special Review decision, the Agency will 
not issue a final Special Review decision until 30 days after inclusion 
of a memorandum concerning that meeting in the public docket. During 
those 30 days, any person or party may submit written comments to the 
Agency regarding the subject matter of the meeting in question. The 
Agency may issue a final Special Review decision without allowing this 
30-day period if expedited action is necessary to protect public health 
or the environment, or if the Agency has invited other parties with 
potentially opposing viewpoints to the meeting in

[[Page 51]]

question (e.g., registrants, users, labor, and environmental groups).
    (f) The Agency may decline to meet subsequently with any person or 
party who asserts unreasonable confidential business information claims 
pursuant to Sec. 154.15(c) for the purpose of circumventing the 
docketing procedures described in Sec. 154.15(b).


<R05>
Sec. 154.29  Informal public hearings.

    (a) Timing. At any time after issuance of a Notice of Special Review 
and prior to issuance of a Notice of Final Determination, the 
Administrator may conduct an informal public hearing to gather relevant 
information or otherwise assist Agency decisionmaking.
    (b) Federal Register notice. The Administrator shall issue a notice 
for publication in the Federal Register of any informal public hearing 
to be held under this section. The notice shall contain the following 
information:
    (1) The time, date, and place of the hearing.
    (2) A brief description of the procedures governing participation in 
the hearing by interested persons.
    (3) The issues to be considered at the hearing.
    (c) Transcript. A verbatim transcript of the hearing shall be 
prepared and filed in the public docket.


<R05>
Sec. 154.31  Notices of Preliminary Determination.

    The Administrator shall prepare a Notice of Preliminary 
Determination after the close of the comment period on a Notice of 
Special Review.
    (a) Contents of notice. The Notice of Preliminary Determination 
shall respond to all significant comments submitted in response to the 
Notice of Special Review. For each use of a pesticide product that was 
the subject of the Notice of Special Review, the Notice of Preliminary 
Determination shall also include, as appropriate:
    (1) A determination whether the use satisfies any of the risk 
criteria set forth in Sec. 154.7, and a discussion of the reasons for 
the determination.
    (2) A determination of whether any changes in the composition, 
packaging, labeling, or restrictions on use of a pesticide product that 
were proposed in an application for new or amended registration 
submitted after issuance of the Notice of Special Review would reduce 
the risk so that the use no longer would satisfy any of the risk 
criteria in Sec. 154.7.
    (3) If the use satisfies any of the risk criteria set forth in Sec. 
154.7, a determination of whether the adverse effects posed by the use 
are unreasonable, taking into account the economic, social, and 
environmental costs and benefits of the use of the product, and a 
discussion of reasons for the determination.
    (4) If the use is determined to pose an unreasonable adverse effect, 
a statement of the regulatory action, if any, which the Agency intends 
to initiate with respect to the use, and a discussion of the reasons for 
initiating that regulatory action.
    (5) A statement that the Administrator is requesting comments from 
the Secretary of Agriculture and the Scientific Advisory Panel on the 
notices and analysis specified in paragraph (b) of this section, and 
that the notices and analysis are available on request.
    (6) Instructions to interested persons on how to submit comments 
(including the deadline for submission of comments).
    (7) The location of the docket under Sec. 154.15 and the times 
during which the docket will be available for inspection and copying.
    (b) Referral to Secretary of Agriculture and Scientific Advisory 
Panel. If the Administrator proposes to cancel, deny, or change the 
classification of the registration of a pesticide product which is the 
subject of a Special Review, or to hold a hearing under FIFRA section 
6(b)(2) on whether to take any of those actions, he shall:
    (1) Prepare a proposed form of a Notice of Intent to Cancel, a 
Notice of Intent to Deny Registration, a Notice of Intent to Hold a 
Hearing, and/or a Notice of Intent to Change Classification, as 
appropriate.
    (2) Prepare an Agricultural Impact Analysis, analyzing the impact of 
the proposed action on production and prices of agricultural 
commodities, retail food prices, and otherwise on the agricultural 
economy.

[[Page 52]]

    (3) Send the proposed notices and analysis to the Secretary of 
Agriculture and the Scientific Advisory Panel for comment, as provided 
by the Act.
    (4) Send the Notice of Preliminary Determination and the other 
notices and analysis prepared under this section to all registrants and 
applicants for registration of products that are subject to the Special 
Review.
    (c) Publication. The Agency shall issue the Notice of Preliminary 
Determination for publication in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 154.33  Notice of Final Determination.

    (a) Publication and notice to registrants and applicants. The 
Administrator shall prepare a Notice of Final Determination after the 
close of the comment period on a Notice of Preliminary Determination. As 
necessary, the Administrator shall also prepare Notices of Intent to 
Cancel, Notices of Denial, Notices of Intent to Hold a Hearing under 
FIFRA section 6(b)(2), or Notices of Intent to Change Classification.
    (b) Contents. The Notice of Final Determination shall include:
    (1) For each pesticide use subject to the Notice of Preliminary 
Determination, the Agency's final determination with respect to each 
use, along with a discussion of the reasons for the determination.
    (2) Any comments submitted by the Secretary of Agriculture or the 
Scientific Advisory Panel, and the responses of the Administrator to 
these comments.
    (3) The response of the Administrator to any significant public 
comments submitted on the Notice of Preliminary Determination.
    (4) Instructions to registrants, applicants for registration, and 
other interested persons concerning the procedures which will be used to 
implement any regulatory action which the Administrator has decided 
upon, including instructions concerning how to request hearings, if 
hearings are available as of right under the Act or have been made 
available by the Administrator under the Act.
    (5) The location of the docket under Sec. 154.15 and the times 
during which the docket will be available for inspection and copying.
    (c) Publication and notification of registrants and applicants. The 
Notice of Final Determination and any Notice of Intent to Cancel, Notice 
of Denial, Notice of Intent to Hold a Hearing, or Notice of Intent to 
Change Classification shall be published in the Federal Register. If the 
Administrator issues a Notice of Intent to Cancel, Notice of Denial, 
Notice of Intent to Hold a Hearing, or Notice of Intent to Change 
Classification, such notice, along with the Notice of Final 
Determination, also shall be sent by certified mail to all affected 
registrants and applicants.


<R05>
Sec. 154.34  Expedited procedures.

    (a) The Agency may elect to issue a Notice of Special Review and a 
Notice of Preliminary Determination simultaneously; or, to initiate 
cancellation, suspension, or denial proceedings concerning a pesticide 
or any of its uses without first conducting a Special Review or issuing 
a Notice of Preliminary Determination.
    (b) If the Agency elects to issue a simultaneous Notice of Special 
Review and Notice of Preliminary Determination, the Agency will make the 
docket for that decision available for public inspection no more than 3 
months after the Agency privately notifies the registrant of its risk 
concerns pursuant to Sec. 154.21(a).


<R05>
Sec. 154.35  Finality of determinations.

    (a) The Administrator will not approve an application for 
registration or amended registration of a pesticide product except by 
use of the procedures specified in paragraph (c) of this section, if:
    (1) The application proposes registration of a product for a use 
which earlier had been the subject of a notice under Sec. 154.21(a);
    (2) After the Administrator issued the notice, he determined not to 
initiate a Special Review, because of a proposal by an applicant for 
registration or amended registration to change the terms and conditions 
of registration of the product in a way which would reduce the risk 
sufficiently to eliminate the need for a Special Review; and

[[Page 53]]

    (3) The application for registration or amended registration now 
proposes that the terms and conditions which served as the basis of the 
earlier determination be eliminated, or be modified in a way which might 
increase the risk which was the subject of the notice under Sec. 
154.21(a).
    (b) The Administrator will not approve an application for 
registration or amended registration of a pesticide product except by 
use of the procedures specified in paragraph (c) of this section, if:
    (1) The application proposed registration of a product for a use 
which earlier had been the subject of a Notice of Special Review issued 
under Sec. 154.25;
    (2) After the Administrator issued that Notice, he determined not to 
issue a notice under FIFRA section 3(c)(6) or 6(b) because of a proposal 
by an applicant for registration or amended registration to change the 
terms and conditions of registration of the product in a way which would 
reduce the risk sufficiently to eliminate the need for issuance of a 
notice under FIFRA section 3(c)(6) or 6(b); and
    (3) The application for registration or amended registration now 
proposes that the terms and conditions of registration which served as 
the basis for the earlier determination now be eliminated or be modified 
in a way which might increase the risk which was the subject of the 
Notice of Special Review.
    (c) An application to which paragraph (a) or (b) of this section 
applies may not be approved until:
    (1) The Administrator issues a notice for publication in the Federal 
Register which describes why the application is subject to the 
provisions of this section, states that the Administrator proposes to 
approve the application and his reasons, solicits public comment on 
whether the application should be approved, and provides a period not 
less than 30 days for comments to be submitted; and
    (2) If any substantive comments are submitted in response to the 
notice, the Administrator issues a second notice for publication in the 
Federal Register responding to the comments.

<R04>
         Subpart B_Docketing and Public Participation Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 155.23  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this part, confidential business information 
means trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information 
under FIFRA sec. 10(b) or 5 U.S.C. 552(b) (3) or (4).


<R05>
Sec. 155.25  Schedule.

    EPA will issue annually in the Federal Register a notice listing the 
pesticides (or groups of pesticides) for

[[Page 54]]

which Registration Standards are currently being developed. The list 
will include pesticides for which a Registration Standard is scheduled 
for issuance within the next year, and the approximate sequence of 
issuance. The list may also include pesticides for which a Registration 
Standard will be under development during the upcoming year, but which 
are not scheduled for issuance until the succeeding year. The notice 
will invite comment and submission of information on the individual 
pesticides on the list.


<R05>
Sec. 155.27  Agency review of data.

    EPA will independently (or using the services of disinterested 
contractors or consultants) review available data in preparation for the 
development of a Registration Standard, and will be responsible for the 
drafting of the Registration Standard based on such data reviews. The 
Agency will not permit registrants to prepare, or assist in the 
preparation of, data reviews or other Registration Standard documents. 
The Agency may, however, meet with registrants to discuss its pending 
reviews, decisions, or documents, in accordance with the meeting 
procedures in Sec. 155.30, and the docketing procedures in Sec. 
155.32.


<R05>
Sec. 155.30  Meetings and communications.

    EPA personnel may, upon their own initiative or upon request of any 
interested person or party, meet or communicate with persons or parties 
outside of government concerning a Registration Standard under 
development. Such meetings or communications will conform to the 
following policies and procedures:
    (a) Purpose. Meetings and communications may be for the purpose of 
receiving and considering information, exchanging views, exploring 
factual and substantive positions, discussing regulatory options or for 
any other purpose deemed appropriate by the Agency in its deliberations 
concerning development of a Registration Standard. The Agency will not 
commit to take any particular action concerning a Registration Standard 
under development during discussions with any person or party outside of 
government. The Agency will make its final administrative decision on a 
wholly independent basis, and in accordance with law.
    (b) Meetings with persons or parties outside of government. Requests 
by responsible persons or parties outside of government to meet with 
Agency personnel concerning a Registration Standard under development 
should be directed in writing to the Registration Division. Reasonable 
requests will ordinarily be granted on a timely basis. EPA will decide 
the time and place of such meetings, and the Agency personnel who will 
attend. EPA may decline to meet with persons or parties who assert 
unreasonable claims of confidential business information for the purpose 
of circumventing the docketing procedures in Sec. 155.32. EPA may also 
decline to meet if the number or frequency of meetings would delay 
unduly the issuance of the Registration Standard. Further, no person or 
party outside government will be accorded special or preferential access 
to Agency pesticide decisionmaking or to the Agency's decisional 
process.
    (c) Information submitted to the Agency concerning a Registration 
Standard under development. (1) Information, comments, data, or other 
written material submitted to the Agency at any time concerning a 
Registration Standard under development may be claimed by the submitter 
to be confidential business information. The burden of identifying 
claimed confidential business information rests with the submitter, or, 
in meetings, with the participants from outside of government who wish 
to assert a claim of confidentiality.
    (2) To assert a claim of confidentiality for all or any part of a 
written submission concerning a Registration Standard under development, 
the submitter must furnish three copies of the material. Two copies must 
be complete, with claimed confidential business information clearly 
marked in the text. Items in the document that are claimed confidential 
should be numbered consecutively throughout the document. The third copy 
must have the claimed confidential business information excised from the 
text without

[[Page 55]]

closing up or paraphrasing the remaining text. The deletions should be 
consecutively numbered to correspond to the numbering of the complete 
copies. Each copy must be marked on the cover as to whether it contains 
claimed confidential business information.
    (3) Any written material received by the Agency that is not marked 
as confidential will be deemed to be nonconfidential, and may be made 
available through the public docket or otherwise disclosed without prior 
notice to the submitter.
    (d) Memorandum of meeting. For each meeting with a person or party 
outside of government, the Agency will prepare, based on notes taken at 
the meeting, a memorandum of the meeting. The memorandum will be 
prepared within 10 working days of the meeting and will include all of 
the following information:
    (1) The date and time of the meeting.
    (2) The name of the person who requested the meeting.
    (3) The names and affiliations of the participants.
    (4) The subject matter of the meeting.
    (5) A full and accurate description of all significant positions 
taken, facts presented, and arguments made by each participant (except 
that any discussion of claimed confidential business information will be 
identified in meeting notes, and referenced in the memorandum).
    (6) Identification of all documents, proposals, or other materials 
(other than information claimed to be confidential business information) 
distributed or exchanged at the meeting.
    (7) The name of the person who prepared the memorandum.

[50 FR 49001, Nov. 27, 1985, as amended at 58 FR 34203, June 23, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 155.32  Public docket.

    (a) When created. (1) A docket will be created for each Registration 
Standard under development when the Agency begins review of data for the 
Registration Standard or upon publication of the notice described in 
Sec. 155.25 setting out the list and sequence of Registration 
Standards, whichever is earlier. The Agency will announce in its annual 
schedule notice the dockets that are available for Registration 
Standards under development.
    (2) If the Agency notifies registrants privately in accordance with 
40 CFR 154.21 that one or more risk criteria set forth in 40 CFR 154.7

information claim concerning the material).
    (5) A copy of each document, proposal, or other item of written 
material concerning the Registration Standard provided by the Agency to 
any person or party outside of government (within 15 working days after 
the item is made available to such person or party).
    (6) A copy of the Registration Standard;

[[Page 56]]

    (7) With respect to a Registration Standard for which the Agency has 
determined that a substantially complete chronic health and teratology 
data base exists, a copy of the Federal Register notice concerning 
availability of a proposed Registration Standard, and a copy of each 
comment received in response to that notice (within 10 working days 
after receipt by the Agency, or 15 working days if the submitter has 
asserted a confidential business information claim concerning the 
material).
    (8) A copy of the Federal Register notice announcing the issuance of 
the Registration Standard (within 10 working days after the publication 
of the notice).
    (c) Index of the docket. The Agency will establish and keep current 
an index to the docket for each Registration Standard. The index will 
include, but is not limited to:
    (1) A list of each meeting between the Agency and any person or 
party outside of government, containing the date and subject of the 
meeting, the names of participants and the name of the person requesting 
the meeting.
    (2) A list of each document in the docket by title, source or 
recipient(s), and the date the document was received or provided by the 
Agency.
    (d) Availability of docket and indices. (1) The Agency will make 
available to the public for inspection and copying the docket and index 
for any Registration Standard.
    (2) The Agency will establish and maintain a mailing list of persons 
who have specifically requested that they receive indices for 
Registration Standard dockets. On a quarterly basis, EPA will distribute 
the indices of new materials placed in the public docket to these 
persons. Annually, EPA will require that persons on the list renew their 
requests for inclusion on the list.
    (3) The Agency will issue annually in the Federal Register (in 
conjunction with the annual schedule notice specified in Sec. 155.25) a 
notice announcing the availability of docket indices.
    (4) Each Federal Register notice of availability of a Registration 
Standard will announce the availability of the docket index for that 
Standard.


<R05>
Sec. 155.34  Notice of availability.

    (a) The Agency will issue in the Federal Register a notice 
announcing the issuance and availability of Registration Standard which:
    (1) Concerns a previously unregistered active ingredient; or
    (2) Concerns a previously registered active ingredient, and the 
Registration Standard states that registrants will be required (under 
FIFRA section 3(c)(2)(B)) to submit chronic health (including, but not 
limited to, chronic feeding, oncogenicity and reproduction) or 
teratology studies.
    (b) Interested persons may submit comments concerning any 
Registration Standard described by paragraph (a) of this section at any 
time.
    (c) The Agency will issue in the Federal Register a notice 
announcing the availability of, and providing opportunity for comment 
on, each proposed Registration Standard which concerns a previously 
registered active ingredient for which the Agency has determined that a 
substantially complete chronic health and teratology data base exists. 
Following the comment period and issuance of the Registration Standard, 
the Agency will issue in the Federal Register a notice of availability 
of the Registration Standard.

                Subpart C_Registration Review Procedures

    Source: 71 FR 45732, Aug. 9, 2006, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 155.40  General.

    (a) Purpose. These regulations establish procedures for the 
registration review program required in FIFRA section 3(g). Registration 
review is the periodic review of a pesticide's registration to ensure 
that each pesticide registration continues to satisfy the FIFRA standard 
for registration. Under FIFRA section 3(g), each pesticide is required 
to be reviewed every 15 years.
    (1) Among other things, FIFRA requires that a pesticide generally 
will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. 
Registration review is intended to ensure that each

[[Page 57]]

pesticide's registration is based on current scientific and other 
knowledge regarding the pesticide, including its effects on human health 
and the environment.
    (2) If a product fails to satisfy the FIFRA standard for 
registration, the product's registration may be subject to cancellation 
or other remedies under FIFRA.
    (b) Applicability. This subpart applies to every pesticide product 
registered under FIFRA section 3 as well as all pesticide products 
registered under FIFRA section 24(c). It does not apply to products 
whose sale or distribution is authorized under FIFRA section 5 or 
section 18.
    (c) Limitations. (1) At any time, the Agency may undertake any other 
review of a pesticide under FIFRA, irrespective of the pesticide's past, 
ongoing, scheduled, or not yet scheduled registration review.
    (2) When the Agency determines that new data or information are 
necessary for a pesticide's registration review, it will require such

<R05>
Sec. 155.42  Registration review cases.

    (a) Establishing registration review cases. A registration review 
case will be composed of one or more active ingredients and all the 
products containing such ingredient(s). The Agency may group related 
active ingredients into a registration review case when the active 
ingredients are so closely related in chemical structure and 
toxicological profile as to allow common use of some or all required 
data for hazard assessment.
    (1) Existing pesticides. The Agency will assign each pesticide 
registered on or before the effective date of this regulation to a 
registration review case.
    (2) New pesticides. The Agency will assign each pesticide registered 
after the effective date of this regulation to an existing registration 
review case or to a new registration review case.
    (3) A pesticide product that contains multiple active ingredients 
will belong to the registration review cases for each of its active 
ingredients.
    (b) Modifying registration review cases. New data or information may 
suggest that a registration review case should be modified. The Agency 
may modify a registration review case in the following ways:
    (1) Add a new active ingredient to a registration review case. The 
Agency may determine that a new active ingredient is chemically and 
toxicologically similar to active ingredients in an existing 
registration review case and should be grouped with the ingredients in 
the existing registration review case.
    (2) Split a registration review case into two or more registration 
review cases. For example, new data or information may suggest that 
active ingredients in a registration review case are not as similar as 
previously believed and that they belong in two or more separate 
registration review cases.
    (3) Move an ingredient from one registration review case to another. 
For example, new data or information might suggest that an ingredient 
should not be grouped with the other ingredients in the registration 
review case and that it belongs in a different registration review case.
    (4) Merge two or more registration review cases into a single 
registration review case. For example, new data or information might 
suggest that the active ingredients in two or more registration review 
cases should be grouped together for registration review.
    (5) Delete an active ingredient from a registration review case. For 
example, the Agency will remove the ingredient from the case if the 
registrations of all products containing an active ingredient in a 
registration review case are canceled.
    (c) Closing a registration review case. The Agency will close a 
registration review case if all products in the case are canceled.
    (d) Establishing a baseline date for a registration review case. For 
the purpose of scheduling registration reviews, the Agency will 
establish a baseline date for each registration review case. In general, 
the baseline date will be the date of initial registration of the oldest 
pesticide product in the case or the date of reregistration, whichever 
is

[[Page 58]]

later. For the purpose of these procedures, the date of reregistration 
is the date on which the Reregistration Eligibility Decision or Interim 
Reregistration Decision was signed, whichever date the Agency determines 
to be more appropriate based on the comprehensiveness of the review.
    (1) The Agency generally will not change the baseline date for a 
registration review case when it modifies a case by adding or deleting 
ingredients or products.
    (2) When the Agency splits a registration review case into two or 
more cases, the new case(s) generally will have the baseline date of the 
original registration review case.
    (3) When the Agency merges two or more registration review cases 
into a single case, the Agency generally will use the earliest baseline 
date as the baseline date for the new case.
    (e) Announcing registration review cases and baseline dates. The 
Agency will maintain a list of registration review cases, including 
baseline dates, on its website.


<R05>
Sec. 155.44  Establish schedules for registration review.

    The Agency will develop schedules for registration review that are 
generally based on the baseline date of the registration review case or 
on the date of the latest registration review of the registration review 
case. The Agency may also take into account other factors, such as 
achieving process efficiencies by reviewing related cases together, when 
developing schedules for registration review. The Agency will maintain 
schedules for the current year and at least two subsequent years on its 
website.


<R05>
Sec. 155.46  Deciding that a registration review is complete and 

additional review is not needed.

    The Agency may determine that there is no need to reconsider a 
previous decision that a pesticide satisfies the standard of 
registration in FIFRA. In such cases, instead of establishing a 
pesticide registration review case docket as described in Sec. 155.50, 
the Agency may propose that, based on its determination that a pesticide 
meets the FIFRA standard for registration, no further review will be 
necessary. In such circumstances, the Agency will publish a notice in 
the Federal Register announcing the availability of the proposed 
decision and provide a comment period of at least 60 calendar days. The 
Agency will publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing the 
availability of a final version of the decision, an explanation of any 
changes to the proposed decision and its response to any comments. The 
date of the final notice of availability would be used as the date of 
the latest registration review for the purpose of scheduling subsequent 
registration reviews.


<R05>
Sec. 155.48  Data Call-In.

    The Agency may issue a Data Call-In notice under FIFRA section 
3(c)(2)(B) at any time if the Agency believes that the data are needed 
to conduct the registration review. The provisions in FIFRA section 
3(c)(1), (c)(2)(B), and (c)(2)(D) apply to the submission, compensation, 
and exemption of data required to conduct a registration review.


<R05>
Sec. 155.50  Initiate a pesticide's registration review.

    The Agency will initiate a pesticide's registration review by 
establishing a docket for each registration review case, except for 
cases covered under Sec. 155.46, and opening it for public review.
    (a) Contents of the registration review case docket. The Agency will 
place in this docket information that will assist the public in 
understanding the types of information and issues that the Agency may 
consider in the course of the registration review. The Agency may 
include information from its files including, but not limited to, the 
following information:
    (1) An overview of registration review case status;
    (2) A list of current registrations and registrants, any Federal 
Register notices regarding pending registration actions, and current or 
pending tolerances;
    (3) Risk assessment documents;
    (4) Bibliographies concerning current registrations;
    (5) Summaries of incident data; and

[[Page 59]]

    (6) Any other pertinent data or information.
    (b) Public review of the registration review case docket. The Agency 
will publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing the 
availability for public review of the information described in paragraph 
(a) of this section and establishing a comment period of at least 60 
days. During this comment period, interested persons may identify any 
additional information they believe the Agency should consider in the 
course of the registration review.
    (c) Submission of data and other information during the comment 
period. The Agency may identify, either in the notice published under 
paragraph (b) of this section, or at any other time, data or information 
that it does not have but which may be useful, if available, for 
consideration in the registration review. Any person may submit data or 
information in response to such identification. In order to be 
considered during a pesticide's registration review, the submitted data 
or information must meet the requirements listed below.
    (1) In order to ensure that the Agency will consider data or 
information in the conduct of a registration review, interested persons 
must submit the data or information during the comment period 
established in the notice described in paragraph (b) of this section. 
The Agency may, at its discretion, consider data or information 
submitted at a later date.
    (2) The data or information must be presented in a legible and 
useable form. For example, an English translation must accompany any 
material that is not in English and a written transcript must accompany 
any information submitted as an audiographic or videographic record. 
Written material may be submitted in paper or electronic form.
    (3) Submitters must clearly identify the source of any submitted 
data or information.
    (4) Submitters may request the Agency to reconsider data or 
information that the Agency rejected in a previous review. However, 
submitters must explain why they believe the Agency should reconsider 
the data or information in the pesticide's registration review.
    (d) For the purposes of this subpart, the provisions of subpart B do 
not apply.


<R05>
Sec. 155.52  Stakeholder engagement.

    In addition to the public participation opportunities described in 
Sec. 155.50 and Sec. 155.53(c), the Agency may meet with stakeholders 
regarding a forthcoming or ongoing registration review. For example, 
before conducting a pesticide's registration review, the Agency may 
consult with registrants or pesticide users regarding the use and usage 
of the pesticide. The Agency may consult with registrants, pesticide 
users, or other persons during a pesticide's registration review with 
regard to developing risk management options for a pesticide. The Agency 
may informally consult with officials of Federal, State or Tribal 
agencies regarding a forthcoming or ongoing registration review.
    (a) Minutes of meetings with persons outside of government. Subject 
to paragraph (c) of this section, if the Agency meets with one or more 
individuals that are not government employees to discuss matters 
relating to a registration review, the Agency will place in the docket a 
list of meeting attendees, minutes of the meeting, and any documents 
exchanged at the meeting, not later than the earlier of:
    (1) 45 days after the meeting; or
    (2) The date of issuance of the registration review decision.
    (b) Exchange of documents or other written material. In the course 
of a meeting with a person outside of government, the Agency or that 
person may provide the other with a copy of a document or other written 
material that has not yet been released to the public. The Agency will 
place a copy of any such document or other written material in the 
docket along with the minutes of the meeting where the materials were 
exchanged.
    (c) Confidential business information. The Agency will identify, but 
not include in the docket, any confidential business information whose 
disclosure is prohibited by FIFRA section 10.

<R05>
Sec. 155.53  Conduct of a pesticide's registration review.

    The Agency will review data and information described in Sec. 
155.50(a), (b), and (c) or submitted in response to a Data Call-In 
notice that it believes should be considered in the pesticide's 
registration review.
    (a) Assess changes since a pesticide's last review. The Agency will 
assess any changes that may have occurred since the Agency's last 
registration decision in order to determine the significance of such 
changes and whether the pesticide still satisfies the FIFRA standard for 
registration. The Agency will consider whether to conduct a new risk 
assessment to take into account, among other things, any changes in 
statutes or regulations, policy, risk assessment procedures or methods, 
or data requirements. The Agency will consider whether any new data or 
information on the pesticide, including any data or information 
submitted under Sec. 155.50 or in response to a Data Call-In notice, 
warrant conducting a new risk assessment or a new risk/benefit 
assessment. The Agency will also consider whether any new data or 
information regarding an individual pesticide product, including any 
data or information submitted under Sec. 155.50 or in response to a 
Data Call-In notice, such as data or information about an inert 
ingredient in the pesticide product or other information or data 
relating to the composition, labeling or use of the pesticide product, 
warrant additional review of a pesticide product's registration.
    (b) Conduct new assessments as needed. (1) Active ingredient(s) in 
the registration review case. If the Agency finds that a new assessment 
of the pesticide is needed, it will determine whether it can base the 
new assessment on available data or information, including data or 
information submitted under Sec. 155.50 or in response to a Data Call-
In notice. If sufficient data or information are available, the Agency 
will conduct the new risk assessment or risk/benefit assessment. If the 
Agency determines that additional data or information are needed to 
conduct the review, the Agency will issue a Data Call-In notice under 
FIFRA section 3(c)(2)(B).
    (2) Individual product registrations. If the Agency finds that 
additional review of an individual product's registration is needed, it 
will review the pesticide product label, confidential statement of 
formula, product-specific data, or other pertinent data or information, 
as appropriate, to determine whether the registration of the individual 
product meets the FIFRA standard for registration. If the Agency 
determines that additional data or information are needed to conduct the 
review, the Agency will issue a Data Call-In notice under FIFRA section 
3(c)(2)(B).
    (c) Public participation during a pesticide's registration review. 
The Agency will generally make available for public review and comment a 
draft risk assessment for a pesticide if a new risk assessment has been 
conducted. The Agency will publish a notice in the Federal Register 
announcing the availability of the draft risk assessment and provide a 
comment period of at least 30 calendar days. The Agency will publish a 
notice in the Federal Register announcing the availability of a revised 
risk assessment, an explanation of any changes to the proposed document, 
and its response to comments. If the revised risk assessment indicates 
risks of concern, the Agency may, in the notice announcing the 
availability of the revised risk assessment, provide a comment period of 
at least 30 calendar days for the public to submit suggestions for 
mitigating the risk identified in the revised risk assessment.
    (1) The Agency might not request comments on a draft risk assessment 
in cases where the Agency's initial screening of a pesticide indicates 
that it has low use/usage, affects few if any stakeholders or members of 
the public, poses low risk, and/or requires little or no risk 
mitigation. In such cases, the Agency will make a draft risk assessment 
available for public review and comment when it issues a proposed 
decision on the registration review case.
    (2) If the Agency finds that it is not necessary to conduct a new 
risk assessment, it will issue a proposed decision on the registration 
review case as described in Sec. 155.58.

[[Page 61]]


<R05>
Sec. 155.56  Interim registration review decision.

    The Agency may issue, when it determines it to be appropriate, an 
interim registration review decision before completing a registration 
review. Among other things, the interim registration review decision may 
require new risk mitigation measures, impose interim risk mitigation 
measures, identify data or information required to complete the review, 
and include schedules for submitting the required data, conducting the 
new risk assessment and completing the registration review. A FIFRA 
3(c)(2)(B) notice requiring the needed data or information may precede, 
accompany, or follow issuance of the interim registration review 
decision. The Agency will follow procedures in Sec. 155.58 when issuing 
an interim registration review decision.


<R05>
Sec. 155.57  Registration review decision.

    A registration review decision is the Agency's determination whether 
a pesticide meets, or does not meet, the standard for registration in 
FIFRA.


<R05>
Sec. 155.58  Procedures for issuing a decision on a registration review case.

    (a) The Agency will publish a notice in the Federal Register 
announcing the availability of a proposed registration review decision 
or a proposed interim registration review decision. At that time, the 
Agency will place in the pesticide's registration review docket the 
Agency's proposed decision and the bases for the decision. There will be 
a comment period of at least 60 calendar days on the proposed decision.
    (b) In its proposed decision, the Agency will, among other things:
    (1) State its proposed findings with respect to the FIFRA standard 
for registration and describe the basis for such proposed findings.
    (2) Identify proposed risk mitigation measures or other remedies as 
needed and describe the basis for such proposed requirements.
    (3) State whether it believes that additional data are needed and, 
if so, describe what is needed. A FIFRA 3(c)(2)(B) notice requiring such 
data may be issued in conjunction with a proposed or final decision on 
the registration review case or a proposed or final interim decision on 
a registration review case.
    (4) Specify proposed labeling changes; and
    (5) Identify deadlines that it intends to set for completing any 
required actions.
    (c) After considering any comments on the proposed decision, the 
Agency will issue a registration review decision or interim registration 
review decision. This decision will include an explanation of any 
changes to the proposed decision and the Agency's response to 
significant comments. The Agency will publish a notice in the Federal 
Register announcing the availability of a registration review decision 
or interim registration review decision. The registration review case 
docket will remain open until all actions required in the final decision 
on the registration review case have been completed.
    (d) If the registrant fails to take the action required in a 
registration review decision or interim registration review decision, 
the Agency may take appropriate action under FIFRA.

[73 FR 64224, Oct. 29, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 156.10  Labeling requirements.

    (a) General--(1) Contents of the label. Every pesticide product 
shall bear a label containing the information specified by the Act and 
the regulations in this part. The contents of a label must show clearly 
and prominently the following:
    (i) The name, brand, or trademark under which the product is sold as 
prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section;
    (ii) The name and address of the producer, registrant, or person for 
whom produced as prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section;
    (iii) The net contents as prescribed in paragraph (d) of this 
section;
    (iv) The product registration number as prescribed in paragraph (e) 
of this section;
    (v) The producing establishment number as prescribed in paragraph 
(f) of this section;
    (vi) An ingredient statement as prescribed in paragraph (g) of this 
section;
    (vii) Hazard and precautionary statements as prescribed in subpart D 
of this part for human and domestic animal hazards and subpart E of this 
part for environmental hazards.
    (viii) The directions for use as prescribed in paragraph (i) of this 
section; and
    (ix) The use classification(s) as prescribed in paragraph (j) of 
this section.
    (2) Prominence and legibility. (i) All words, statements, graphic 
representations, designs or other information required on the labeling 
by the Act or the regulations in this part must be clearly legible to a 
person with normal vision, and must be placed with such conspicuousness 
(as compared with other words, statements, designs, or graphic matter on 
the labeling) and expressed in such terms as to render it likely to be 
read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary 
conditions of purchase and use.
    (ii) All required label text must:
    (A) Be set in 6-point or larger type;
    (B) Appear on a clear contrasting background; and
    (C) Not be obscured or crowded.
    (3) Language to be used. All required label or labeling text shall 
appear in the English language. However, the Agency may require or the 
applicant may propose additional text in other languages as is 
considered necessary to protect the public. When additional text in 
another language is necessary, all labeling requirements will be applied 
equally to both the English and other-language versions of the labeling.
    (4) Placement of Label--(i) General. The label shall appear on or be 
securely attached to the immediate container of the pesticide product. 
For purposes of this section, and the misbranding provisions of the Act, 
``securely attached''

[[Page 63]]

shall mean that a label can reasonably be expected to remain affixed 
during the foreseeable conditions and period of use. If the immediate 
container is enclosed within a wrapper or outside container through 
which the label cannot be clearly read, the label must also be securely 
attached to such outside wrapper or container, if it is a part of the 
package as customarily distributed or sold.
    (ii) Tank cars and other bulk containers--(A) Transportation. While 
a pesticide product is in transit, the appropriate provisions of 49 CFR 
parts 170-189, concerning the transportation of hazardous materials, and 
specifically those provisions concerning the labeling, marking and 
placarding of hazardous materials and the vehicles carrying them, define 
the basic Federal requirements. In addition, when any registered 
pesticide product is transported in a tank car, tank truck or other 
mobile or portable bulk container, a copy of the accepted label must be 
attached to the shipping papers, and left with the consignee at the time 
of delivery.
    (B) Storage. When pesticide products are stored in bulk containers, 
whether mobile or stationary, which remain in the custody of the user, a 
copy of the label of labeling, including all appropriate directions for 
use, shall be securely attached to the container in the immediate 
vicinity of the discharge control valve.
    (5) False or misleading statements. Pursuant to section 2(q)(1)(A) 
of the Act, a pesticide or a device declared subject to the Act pursuant 
to Sec. 152.500, is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading 
in any particular including both pesticidal and non-pesticidal claims. 
Examples of statements or representations in the labeling which 
constitute misbranding include:
    (i) A false or misleading statement concerning the composition of 
the product;
    (ii) A false or misleading statement concerning the effectiveness of 
the product as a pesticide or device;
    (iii) A false or misleading statement about the value of the product 
for purposes other than as a pesticide or device;
    (iv) A false or misleading comparison with other pesticides or 
devices;
    (v) Any statement directly or indirectly implying that the pesticide 
or device is recommended or endorsed by any agency of the Federal 
Government;
    (vi) The name of a pesticide which contains two or more principal 
active ingredients if the name suggests one or more but not all such 
principal active ingredients even though the names of the other 
ingredients are stated elsewhere in the labeling;
    (vii) A true statement used in such a way as to give a false or 
misleading impression to the purchaser;
    (viii) Label disclaimers which negate or detract from labeling 
statements required under the Act and these regulations;
    (ix) Claims as to the safety of the pesticide or its ingredients, 
including statements such as ``safe,'' ``nonpoisonous,'' 
``noninjurious,'' ``harmless'' or ``nontoxic to humans and pets'' with 
or without such a qualifying phrase as ``when used as directed''; and
    (x) Non-numerical and/or comparative statements on the safety of the 
product, including but not limited to:
    (A) ``Contains all natural ingredients'';
    (B) ``Among the least toxic chemicals known''
    (C) ``Pollution approved''
    (6) Final printed labeling. (i) Except as provided in paragraph 
(a)(6)(ii) of this section, final printed labeling must be submitted and 
accepted prior to registration. However, final printed labeling need not 
be submitted until draft label texts have been provisionally accepted by 
the Agency.
    (ii) Clearly legible reproductions or photo reductions will be 
accepted for unusual labels such as those silk-screened directly onto 
glass or metal containers or large bag or drum labels. Such 
reproductions must be of microfilm reproduction quality.
    (b) Name, brand, or trademark. (1) The name, brand, or trademark 
under which the pesticide product is sold shall appear on the front 
panel of the label.
    (2) No name, brand, or trademark may appear on the label which:
    (i) Is false or misleading, or

[[Page 64]]

    (ii) Has not been approved by the Administrator through registration 
or supplemental registration as an additional name pursuant to Sec. 
152.132.
    (c) Name and address of producer, registrant, or person for whom 
produced. An unqualified name and address given on the label shall be 
considered as the name and address of the producer. If the registrant's 
name appears on the label and the registrant is not the producer, or if 
the name of the person for whom the pesticide was produced appears on 
the label, it must be qualified by appropriate wording such as ``Packed 
for * * *,'' ``Distributed by * * *,'' or ``Sold by * * *'' to show that 
the name is not that of the producer.
    (d) Net weight or measure of contents. (1) The net weight or measure 
of content shall be exclusive of wrappers or other materials and shall 
be the average content unless explicitly stated as a minimum quantity.
    (2) If the pesticide is a liquid, the net content statement shall be 
in terms of liquid measure at 68 [deg]F (20 [deg]C) and shall be 
expressed in conventional American units of fluid ounces, pints, quarts, 
and gallons.
    (3) If the pesticide is solid or semisolid, viscous or pressurized, 
or is a mixture of liquid and solid, the net content statement shall be 
in terms of weight expressed as avoirdupois pounds and ounces.
    (4) In all cases, net content shall be stated in terms of the 
largest suitable units, i.e., ``1 pound 10 ounces'' rather than ``26 
ounces.''
    (5) In addition to the required units specified, net content may be 
expressed in metric units.
    (6) Variation above minimum content or around an average is 
permissible only to the extent that it represents deviation unavoidable 
in good manufacturing practice. Variation below a stated minimum is not 
permitted. In no case shall the average content of the packages in a 
shipment fall below the stated average content.
    (7) For a pesticide product packaged in a refillable container, an 
appropriately sized area on the label may be left blank to allow the net 
weight or measure of content to be marked in by the refiller according 
to 40 CFR 165.65(h) or 165.70(i) prior to distribution or sale of the 
pesticide. As required in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, the net 
contents must be shown clearly and prominently on the label.
    (e) Product registration number. The registration number assigned to 
the pesticide product at the time of registration shall appear on the 
label, preceded by the phrase ``EPA Registration No.,'' or the phrase 
``EPA Reg. No.'' The registration number shall be set in type of a size 
and style similar to other print on that part of the label on which it 
appears and shall run parallel to it. The registration number and the 
required identifying phrase shall not appear in such a manner as to 
suggest or imply recommendation or endorsement of the product by the 
Agency.
    (f) Producing establishment's registration number. The producing 
establishment registration number preceded by the phrase ``EPA Est.'', 
of the final establishment at which the product was produced may appear 
in any suitable location on the label or immediate container. It must 
appear on the wrapper or outside container of the package if the EPA 
establishment registration number on the immediate container cannot be 
clearly read through such wrapper or container. For a pesticide product 
packaged in a refillable container, an appropriately sized area on the 
label may be left blank after the phrase ``EPA Est.'' to allow the EPA 
establishment registration number to be marked in by the refiller 
according to 40 CFR 165.65(h) or 165.70(i) prior to distribution or sale 
of the pesticide.
    (g) Ingredient statement--(1) General. The label of each pesticide 
product must bear a statement which contains the name and percentage by 
weight of each active ingredient, the total percentage by weight of all 
inert ingredients; and if the pesticide contains arsenic in any form, a 
statement of the percentages of total and water-soluble arsenic 
calculated as elemental arsenic. The active ingredients must be 
designated by the term ``active ingredients'' and the inert ingredients 
by the term ``inert ingredients,'' or the singular forms of these terms 
when appropriate. Both terms shall be in the same type size, be aligned 
to the same margin and be equally prominent. The

[[Page 65]]

statement ``Inert Ingredients, none'' is not required for pesticides 
which contain 100 percent active ingredients. Unless the ingredient 
statement is a complete analysis of the pesticide, the term ``analysis'' 
shall not be used as a heading for the ingredient statement.
    (2) Position of ingredient statement. (i) The ingredient statement 
is normally required on the front panel of the label. If there is an 
outside container or wrapper through which the ingredient statement 
cannot be clearly read, the ingredient statement must also appear on 
such outside container or wrapper. If the size or form of the package 
makes it impracticable to place the ingredient statement on the front 
panel of the label, permission may be granted for the ingredient 
statement to appear elsewhere.
    (ii) The text of the ingredient statement must run parallel with 
other text on the panel on which it appears, and must be clearly 
distinguishable from and must not be placed in the body of other text.
    (3) Names to be used in ingredient statement. The name used for each 
ingredient shall be the accepted common name, if there is one, followed 
by the chemical name. The common name may be used alone only if it is 
well known. If no common name has been established, the chemical name 
alone shall be used. In no case will the use of a trademark or 
proprietary name be permitted unless such name has been accepted as a 
common name by the Administrator under the authority of section 
25(c)(6).
    (4) Statements of percentages. The percentages of ingredients shall 
be stated in terms of weight-to-weight. The sum of percentages of the 
active and the inert ingredients shall be 100. Percentages shall not be 
expressed by a range of values such as ``22-25%.'' If the uses of the 
pesticide product are expressed as weight of active ingredient per unit 
area, a statement of the weight of active ingredient per unit volume of 
the pesticide formulation shall also appear in the ingredient statement.
    (5) Accuracy of stated percentages. The percentages given shall be 
as precise as possible reflecting good manufacturing practice. If there 
may be unavoidable variation between manufacturing batches, the value 
stated for each active ingredient shall be the lowest percentage which 
may be present.
    (6) Deterioration. Pesticides which change in chemical composition 
significantly must meet the following labeling requirements:
    (i) In cases where it is determined that a pesticide formulation 
changes chemical composition significantly, the product must bear the 
following statement in a prominent position on the label: ``Not for sale 
or use after [date].''
    (ii) The product must meet all label claims up to the expiration 
time indicated on the label.
    (7) Inert ingredients. The Administrator may require the name of any 
inert ingredient(s) to be listed in the ingredient statement if he 
determines that such ingredient(s) may pose a hazard to man or the 
environment.
    (h) [Reserved]
    (i) Directions for Use--(1) General requirements--(i) Adequacy and 
clarity of directions. Directions for use must be stated in terms which 
can be easily read and understood by the average person likely to use or 
to supervise the use of the pesticide. When followed, directions must be 
adequate to protect the public from fraud and from personal injury and 
to prevent unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.
    (ii) Placement of directions for use. Directions may appear on any 
portion of the label provided that they are conspicuous enough to be 
easily read by the user of the pesticide product. Directions for use may 
appear on printed or graphic matter which accompanies the pesticide 
provided that:
    (A) If required by the Agency, such printed or graphic matter is 
securely attached to each package of the pesticide, or placed within the 
outside wrapper or bag;
    (B) The label bears a reference to the directions for use in 
accompanying leaflets or circulars, such as ``See directions in the 
enclosed circular:'' and
    (C) The Administrator determines that it is not necessary for such 
directions to appear on the label.
    (iii) Exceptions to requirement for direction for use. (A) Detailed 
directions for use may be omitted from labeling of

[[Page 66]]

pesticides which are intended for use only by manufacturers of products 
other than pesticide products in their regular manufacturing processes, 
provided that:
    (1) The label clearly shows that the product is intended for use 
only in manufacturing processes and specifies the type(s) of products 
involved.
    (2) Adequate information such as technical data sheets or bulletins, 
is available to the trade specifying the type of product involved and 
its proper use in manufacturing processes;
    (3) The product will not come into the hands of the general public 
except after incorporation into finished products; and
    (4) The Administrator determines that such directions are not 
necessary to prevent unreasonable adverse effects on man or the 
environment.
    (B) Detailed directions for use may be omitted from the labeling of 
pesticide products for which sale is limited to physicians, 
veterinarians, or druggists, provided that:
    (1) The label clearly states that the product is for use only by 
physicians or veterinarians;
    (2) The Administrator determines that such directions are not 
necessary to prevent unreasonable adverse effects on man or the 
environment; and
    (3) The product is also a drug and regulated under the provisions of 
the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
    (C) Detailed directions for use may be omitted from the labeling of 
pesticide products which are intended for use only by formulators in 
preparing pesticides for sale to the public, provided that:
    (1) There is information readily available to the formulators on the 
composition, toxicity, methods of use, applicable restrictions or 
limitations, and effectiveness of the product for pesticide purposes;
    (2) The label clearly states that the product is intended for use 
only in manufacturing, formulating, mixing, or repacking for use as a 
pesticide and specifies the type(s) of pesticide products involved;
    (3) The product as finally manufactured, formulated, mixed, or 
repackaged is registered; and
    (4) The Administrator determines that such directions are not 
necessary to prevent unreasonable adverse effects on man or the 
environment.
    (2) Contents of Directions for Use. The directions for use shall 
include the following, under the headings ``Directions for Use'':
    (i) The statement of use classification as prescribed in paragraph 
(j) of this section immediately under the heading ``Directions for 
Use.''
    (ii) Immediately below the statement of use classification, the 
statement ``It is a violation of Federal law to use this product in a 
manner inconsistent with its labeling.''
    (iii) The site(s) of application, as for example the crops, animals, 
areas, or objects to be treated.
    (iv) The target pest(s) associated with each site.
    (v) The dosage rate associated with each site and pest.
    (vi) The method of application, including instructions for dilution, 
if required, and type(s) of application apparatus or equipment required.
    (vii) The frequency and timing of applications necessary to obtain 
effective results without causing unreasonable adverse effects on the 
environment.
    (viii) Worker protection statements meeting the requirements of 
subpart K of this part.
    (ix) Specific directions concerning the storage, residue removal and 
disposal of the pesticide and its container, in accordance with subpart 
H of this part. These instructions must be grouped and appear under the 
heading, ``Storage and Disposal.'' This heading must be set in type of 
the same minimum sizes as required for the child hazard warning. (See 
table in Sec. 156.60(b))
    (x) Any limitations or restrictions on use required to prevent 
unreasonable adverse effects, such as:
    (A) Required intervals between application and harvest of food or 
feed crops.
    (B) Rotational crop restrictions.
    (C) Warnings as required against use on certain crops, animals, 
objects, or in or adjacent to certain areas.
    (D) For total release foggers as defined in Sec. 156.78(d)(1), the 
following

[[Page 67]]

statements must be included in the ``Directions for Use.''

    DO NOT use more than one fogger per room. DO NOT use in small, 
enclosed spaces such as closets, cabinets, or under counters or tables. 
Do not use in a room 5 ft.x5 ft. or smaller; instead, allow fog to enter 
from other rooms. Turn off ALL ignition sources such as pilot lights 
(shut off gas valves), other open flames, or running electrical 
appliances that cycle off and on (i.e., refrigerators, thermostats, 
etc.). Call your gas utility or management company if you need 
assistance with your pilot lights.''

    (E) For restricted use pesticides, a statement that the pesticide 
may be applied under the direct supervision of a certified applicator 
who is not physically present at the site of application but nonetheless 
available to the person applying the pesticide, unless the Agency has 
determined that the pesticide may only be applied under the direct 
supervision of a certified applicator who is physically present.
    (F) Other pertinent information which the Administrator determines 
to be necessary for the protection of man and the environment.
    (j) Statement of use classification. Any pesticide product for which 
some uses are classified for general use and others for restricted use 
shall be separately labeled according to the labeling standards set 
forth in this subsection, and shall be marketed as separate products 
with different registration numbers, one bearing directions only for 
general use(s) and the other bearing directions for restricted use(s) 
except that, if a product has both restricted use(s) and general use(s), 
both of these uses may appear on a product labeled for restricted use. 
Such products shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph (j)(2) of 
this section.
    (1) General Use Classification. Pesticide products bearing 
directions for use(s) classified general shall be labeled with the exact 
words ``General Classification'' immediately below the heading 
``Directions for Use.'' And reference to the general classification that 
suggests or implies that the general utility of the pesticide extends 
beyond those purposes and uses contained in the Directions for Use will 
be considered a false or misleading statement under the statutory 
definitions of misbranding.
    (2) Restricted Use Classification. Pesticide products bearing 
direction for use(s) classified restricted shall bear statements of 
restricted use classification on the front panel as described below:
    (i) Front panel statement of restricted use classification. (A) At 
the top of the front panel of the label, set in type of the same minimum 
sizes as required for human hazard signal words (see table in paragraph 
(h)(1)(iv) of this section), and appearing with sufficient prominence 
relative to other text and graphic material on the front panel to make 
it unlikely to be overlooked under customary conditions of purchase and 
use, the statement ``Restricted Use Pesticide'' shall appear.
    (B) Directly below this statement on the front panel, a summary 
statement of the terms of restriction imposed as a precondition to 
registration shall appear. If use is restricted to certified 
applicators, the following statement is required: ``For retail sale to 
and use only by Certified Applicators or persons under their direct 
supervision and only for those uses covered by the Certified 
Applicator's certification.'' If, however, other regulatory restrictions 
are imposed, the Administrator will define the appropriate wording for 
the terms of restriction by regulation.

Sec. 156.60  General.

    Each product label is required to bear hazard and precautionary 
statements for humans and domestic animals (if applicable) as prescribed 
in this subpart. Hazard statements describe the type of hazard that may 
occur, while precautionary statements will either

[[Page 68]]

direct or inform the user of actions to take to avoid the hazard or 
mitigate its effects.
    (a) Location of statements--(1) Front panel statements. The signal 
word, child hazard warning, and, in certain cases, the first aid 
statement are required to appear on the front panel of the label, and 
also in any supplemental labeling intended to accompany the product in 
distribution or sale.
    (2) Statements elsewhere on label. Hazard and precautionary 
statements not required on the front panel may appear on other panels of 
the label, and may be required also in supplemental labeling. These 
include, but are not limited to, the human hazard and precautionary 
statements, domestic animal statements if applicable, a Note to 
Physician, and physical or chemical hazard statements.
    (b) Placement and prominence--(1) Front panel statements. All 
required front panel warning statements shall be grouped together on the 
label, and shall appear with sufficient prominence relative to other 
front panel text and graphic material to make them unlikely to be 
overlooked under customary conditions of purchase and use. The table 
below shows the minimum type size requirements for the front panel 
warning statements for various front panel sizes.

Sec. 156.62  Toxicity Category.

    This section establishes four Toxicity Categories for acute hazards 
of pesticide products, Category I being the highest toxicity category. 
Most human hazard, precautionary statements, and human personal 
protective equipment statements are based upon the Toxicity Category of 
the pesticide product as sold or distributed. In addition, toxicity 
categories may be used for regulatory purposes other than labeling, such 
as classification for restricted use and requirements for child-
resistant packaging. In certain cases, statements based upon the 
Toxicity Category of the product as diluted for use are also permitted. 
A Toxicity Category is assigned for each of five types of acute 
exposure, as specified in the table in this paragraph.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 156.64  Signal word.

    (a) Requirement. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4), each 
pesticide product must bear on the front panel a signal word, reflecting 
the highest Toxicity Category (Category I is the highest toxicity 
category) to which the product is assigned by any of the five routes of 
exposure in Sec. 156.62. The signal word

[[Page 69]]

must also appear together with the heading for the human precautionary 
statement section of the labeling (see Sec. 156.70).
    (1) Toxicity Category I. Any pesticide product meeting the criteria 
of Toxicity Category I for any route of exposure must bear on the front 
panel the signal word ``DANGER.'' In addition, if the product is 
assigned to Toxicity Category I on the basis of its oral, inhalation or 
dermal toxicity (as distinct from skin and eye irritation), the word 
``Poison'' must appear in red on a background of distinctly contrasting 
color, and the skull and crossbones symbol must appear in immediate 
proximity to the word ``Poison.''
    (2) Toxicity Category II. Any pesticide product meeting the criteria 
of Toxicity Category II as the highest category by any route of exposure 
must bear on the front panel the signal word ``WARNING.''
    (3) Toxicity Category III. Any pesticide product meeting the 
criteria of Toxicity Category III as the highest category by any route 
of exposure must bear on the front panel the signal word ``CAUTION.''
    (4) Toxicity Category IV. A pesticide product meeting the criteria 
of Toxicity Category IV by all routes of exposure is not required to 
bear a signal word. If a signal word is used, it must be ``CAUTION.''
    (b) Use of signal words. In no case may a product:
    (1) Bear a signal word reflecting a higher Toxicity Category than 
indicated by the route of exposure of highest toxicity, unless the 
Agency determines that such labeling is necessary to prevent 
unreasonable adverse effects on man or the environment;
    (2) Bear a signal word reflecting a lesser Toxicity Category 
associated with a diluted product. Although precautionary statements for 
use dilutions may be included on label, the signal word must reflect the 
toxicity of the product as distributed or sold; or
    (3) Bear different signal words on different parts of the label.


<R05>
Sec. 156.66  Child hazard warning.

    (a) Each pesticide product must bear on the front panel of the label 
the statement ``Keep Out of Reach of Children.'' That statement, or any 
alternative statement approved by EPA, must appear on a separate line in 
close proximity to the signal word, if required. The statement is 
required on Toxicity Category IV products that do not otherwise require 
a signal word.
    (b) In its discretion, EPA may waive the requirement, or require or 
permit an alternative child hazard warning, if:
    (1) The applicant can demonstrate that the likelihood of exposure of 
children to the pesticide during distribution, marketing, storage or use 
is remote (for example, an industrial use product); or
    (2) The pesticide is approved for use on children (for example, an 
insect repellent).
    (c) EPA may approve an alternative child hazard warning that more 
appropriately reflects the nature of the pesticide product to which 
children may be exposed (for example, an impregnated pet collar). In 
this case, EPA may also approve placement on other than the front panel.


<R05>
Sec. 156.68  First aid statement.

    (a) Product as sold and distributed. Each product must bear a first 
aid statement if the product has systemic effects in Category I, II, or 
III, or skin or eye irritation effects in Category I or II.
    (b) Product as diluted for use. If the product labeling bears 
directions for dilution with water prior to use, the label may also 
include a statement describing how the first aid measures may be 
modified for the diluted product. Such a statement must reflect the 
Toxicity Category(ies) of the diluted product, based upon data for the 
route of exposure (or calculations if appropriate). If the labeling 
provides for a range of use dilutions, only that use dilution 
representing the highest concentration allowed by labeling may be used 
as the basis for a statement pertaining to the diluted product. The 
statement for a diluted product may not substitute for the statement for 
the concentrate, but augments the information provided for the 
concentrate.
    (c) Heading. The heading of the statement may be ``First Aid'' or 
``Statement of Practical Treatment.''

[[Page 70]]

    (d) Location of first aid statement. The first aid statement must 
appear on the front panel of the label of all products assigned to 
Toxicity Category I by any route of exposure. Upon review, the Agency 
may permit reasonable variations in the placement of the first aid 
statement if a reference such as ``See first aid statement on back 
panel'' appears on the front panel. The first aid statement for products 
assigned to Toxicity Categories II or III may appear on any panel of the 
label.


<R05>
Sec. 156.70  Precautionary statements for human hazards.

    (a) Requirement. Human hazard and precautionary statements as 
required must appear together on the label or labeling under the general 
heading ``Precautionary Statements'' and under appropriate subheadings 
similar to ``Humans and Domestic Animals,'' ``Environmental Hazards'' 
(see subpart E of this part) and ``Physical or Chemical Hazards.'' The 
phrase ``and Domestic Animals'' may be omitted from the heading if 
domestic animals will not be exposed to the product.
    (b) Content of statements. When data or other information show that 
an acute hazard may exist to humans or domestic animals, the label must 
bear precautionary statements describing the particular hazard, the 
route(s) of exposure and the precautions to be taken to avoid accident, 
injury or toxic effect or to mitigate the effect. The precautionary 
paragraph must be immediately preceded by the appropriate signal word.
    (c) Typical precautionary statements. The table below presents 
typical hazard and precautionary statements. Specific statements 
pertaining to the hazards of the product and its uses must be approved 
by the Agency. With Agency approval, statements may be augmented to 
reflect the hazards and precautions associated with the product as 
diluted for use. Refer to Sec. 156.68(b) for requirements for use 
dilution statements.

Sec. 156.146  Residue removal instructions for nonrefillable containers--rigid 

containers with dilutable pesticides.

    The label of each dilutable (liquid or solid) pesticide product 
packaged in a rigid nonrefillable container must include the following 
residue removal instructions as appropriate.
    (a) Timing of the residue removal procedure. One of the following 
statements must immediately precede the instructions required in 
paragraph (b) of this section and must be consistent with the 
instructions in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section:
    (1) ``Clean container promptly after emptying.''
    (2) ``Triple rinse or pressure rinse container (or equivalent) 
promptly after emptying.''
    (3) ``Triple rinse container (or equivalent) promptly after 
emptying.''
    (b) Triple rinse instructions. The label of each dilutable pesticide 
product packaged in rigid nonrefillable containers must include one of 
the following sets of instructions.
    (1) For liquid dilutable pesticide products in containers small 
enough to shake, use the following instructions: ``Triple rinse as 
follows: Empty the remaining contents into application equipment or a 
mix tank and drain for 10 seconds after the flow begins to drip. Fill 
the container 1/4 full with water and recap. Shake for 10 seconds. Pour 
rinsate into application equipment or a mix tank or store rinsate for 
later use or disposal. Drain for 10 seconds after the flow begins to 
drip. Repeat this procedure two more times.''
    (2) For solid dilutable pesticide products in containers small 
enough to shake, use the following instructions: ``Triple rinse as 
follows: Empty the remaining contents into application equipment or a 
mix tank. Fill the container 1/4 full with water and recap. Shake for 10 
seconds. Pour rinsate into application equipment or a mix tank or store 
rinsate for later use or disposal. Drain for 10 seconds after the flow 
begins to drip. Repeat this procedure two more times.''
    (3) For containers that are too large to shake, use the following 
instructions: ``Triple rinse as follows: Empty remaining contents into 
application

[[Page 75]]

equipment or a mix tank. Fill the container 1/4 full with water. Replace 
and tighten closures. Tip container on its side and roll it back and 
forth, ensuring at least one complete revolution, for 30 seconds. Stand 
the container on its end and tip it back and forth several times. Turn 
the container over onto its other end and tip it back and forth several 
times. Empty the rinsate into application equipment or a mix tank or 
store rinsate for later use or disposal. Repeat this procedure two more 
times.''
    (c) Pressure rinse instructions. The label of each dilutable 
pesticide product packaged in rigid nonrefillable containers may include 
one of the following sets of instructions, and one of them must be used 
if the statement in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is used. If one of 
these statements is included on the label, it must immediately follow 
the triple rinse instructions specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (1) For liquid dilutable pesticide products, use the following label 
instruction: ``Pressure rinse as follows: Empty the remaining contents 
into application equipment or a mix tank and continue to drain for 10 
seconds after the flow begins to drip. Hold container upside down over 
application equipment or mix tank or collect rinsate for later use or 
disposal. Insert pressure rinsing nozzle in the side of the container, 
and rinse at about 40 PSI for at least 30 seconds. Drain for 10 seconds 
after the flow begins to drip.''
    (2) For solid dilutable pesticide products, use the following label 
instruction: ``Pressure rinse as follows: Empty the remaining contents 
into application equipment or a mix tank. Hold container upside down 
over application equipment or mix tank or collect rinsate for later use 
or disposal. Insert pressure rinsing nozzle in the side of the 
container, and rinse at about 40 PSI for at least 30 seconds. Drain for 
10 seconds after the flow begins to drip.''
    (d) Non-water diluent. (1) A registrant who wishes to require users 
to clean a container with a diluent other than water (e.g., solvents) 
must submit to EPA a written request to modify the residue removal 
instructions of this section. The registrant may not distribute or sell 
the pesticide with the modified residue removal instructions until EPA 
approves the request in writing.
    (2) The registrant must indicate why a non-water diluent is 
necessary for efficient residue removal, and must propose residue 
removal instructions and disposal instructions that are appropriate for 
the characteristics and formulation of the pesticide product and non-
water diluent. The proposed residue removal instructions must identify 
the diluent. If the Directions for Use permit the application of a 
mixture of the pesticide and the non-water diluent, the instructions may 
allow the rinsate to be added to the application equipment or mix tank. 
If the Directions for Use do not identify the non-water diluent as an 
allowable addition to the pesticide, the instructions must require 
collection and storage of the rinsate in a rinsate collection system.
    (3) EPA may approve the request if EPA finds that the proposed 
instructions are necessary and appropriate.

Sec. 156.200  Scope and applicability.

    (a) Scope. (1) This subpart prescribes statements that must be 
placed on the pesticide label and in pesticide labeling. These 
statements incorporate by reference the Worker Protection Standard, part 
170 of this chapter. The requirements addressed in these statements are 
designed to reduce the risk of illness or injury resulting from workers' 
and pesticide handlers' occupational exposures to pesticides used in the 
production of agricultural plants on agricultural establishments as 
defined in Sec. 170.3 of this chapter. These statements refer to 
specific workplace practices designed to reduce or eliminate exposure 
and to respond to emergencies that may arise from the exposures that may 
occur.
    (2) This subpart prescribes interim requirements that must be placed 
on the pesticide label and in pesticide labeling. These interim 
requirements pertain to restricted-entry intervals, personal protective 
equipment, and notification. On a case-by-case basis, these interim 
requirements will be reviewed and may be revised during reregistration 
or other agency review processes.
    (b) Applicability. (1) The requirements of this subpart apply to 
each pesticide product that bears directions for use in the production 
of any agricultural plant on any agricultural establishment as defined 
in Sec. 170.3 of this chapter, or whose labeling reasonably permits 
such use.
    (2) The requirements of this subpart do not apply to a product that 
bears directions solely for uses excepted by Sec. 170.202(b) of this 
chapter.
    (c) Effective dates. No product to which this subpart applies shall 
be distributed or sold without amended labeling by any registrant after 
April 21, 1994, or by any person after October 23, 1995.

Sec. 156.203  Definitions.

    Terms in this subpart have the same meanings as they do in the 
Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended. In 
addition, the following terms, as used in this subpart, shall have the 
meanings stated below:
    Fumigant means any pesticide product that is a vapor or gas or forms 
a vapor or gas on application and whose method of pesticidal action is 
through the gaseous state.

[[Page 77]]

    Restricted-entry interval or REI means the time after the end of a 
pesticide application during which entry to the treated area is 
restricted.

<R05>
Sec. 156.204  Modification and waiver of requirements.

    (a) Modification on Special Review. If the Agency concludes in 
accordance with Sec. 154.25(c) of this chapter that a pesticide should 
be placed in Special Review because the pesticide meets or exceeds the 
criteria for human health effects of Sec. 154.7(a)(1)(2) or (6) of this 
chapter, the Agency may modify the personal protective equipment 
required for handlers or early-entry workers or both, the restricted-
entry intervals, or the notification to workers requirements.
    (b) Other modifications. The Agency, pursuant to this subpart and 
authorities granted in FIFRA sections 3, 6, and 12, may, on its 
initiative or based on data submitted by any person, modify or waive the 
requirements of this subpart, or permit or require alternative labeling 
statements. Supporting data may be either data conducted according to 
Subdivisions U or K of the Pesticide Assessments guidelines or data from 
medical, epidemiological, or health effects studies. A registrant who 
wishes to modify any of the statements required in Sec. Sec. 156.206, 
156.208, 156.210, or 156.212 must submit an application for amended 
registration unless specifically directed otherwise by the Agency.

<R05>
Sec. 156.206  General statements.

    (a) Application restrictions. Each product shall bear the statement: 
``Do not apply this product in a way that will contact workers or other 
persons, either directly or through drift. Only protected handlers may 
be in the area during application.'' This statement shall be near the 
beginning of the DIRECTIONS FOR USE section of the labeling under the 
heading AGRICULTURAL USE REQUIREMENTS.
    (b) 40 CFR part 170 reference statement. (1) Each product shall bear 
the reference statement: ``Use this product only in accordance with its 
labeling and with the Worker Protection Standard, 40 CFR part 170.'' 
This statement shall be placed on the product label under the heading 
AGRICULTURAL USE REQUIREMENTS.
    (2) Each product shall bear the statement: ``This standard contains 
requirements for the protection of agricultural workers on farms, 
forests, nurseries, and greenhouses, and handlers of agricultural 
pesticides. It contains requirements for training, decontamination, 
notification, and emergency assistance. It also contains specific 
instructions and exceptions pertaining to the statements on this label 
[in this labeling] about [use any of the following that are applicable] 
personal protective equipment, restricted-entry interval, and 
notification to workers.'' These statements shall be placed immediately 
following the reference statement required by paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, or they shall be placed in the supplemental product labeling 
under the heading AGRICULTURAL USE REQUIREMENTS.
    (3) If the statements in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are 
included in supplemental labeling rather than on the label of the 
pesticide container, the container label must contain this statement 
immediately following the statement required in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section: ``Refer to supplemental labeling entitled AGRICULTURAL USE 
REQUIREMENTS in the DIRECTIONS FOR USE section of the labeling for 
information about this standard.''
    (4) If the statements in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are 
included in supplemental labeling, they must be preceded immediately by 
the statement in paragraph (b)(1) of this section under the heading 
AGRICULTURAL USE REQUIREMENTS in the labeling.
    (c) Product-type identification. (1) If the product contains an 
organophosphate (i.e., an organophosphorus ester that inhibits 
cholinesterase) or an N-methyl carbamate (i.e., an N-methyl carbamic 
acid ester that inhibits cholinesterase), the label shall so state. The 
statement shall be associated with the product name or product-type 
identification or

[[Page 78]]

shall be in the STATEMENT OF PRACTICAL TREATMENT or FIRST AID section of 
the label.
    (2) If the product is a fumigant, the label shall so state. The 
identification shall appear:
    (i) As part of the product name; or
    (ii) Close to the product name, as part of the product-type 
identification or as a separate phrase or sentence.
    (d) State restrictions. Each product shall bear the statement: ``For 
any requirements specific to your State, consult the agency in your 
State responsible for pesticide regulation.'' This statement shall be 
under the heading AGRICULTURAL USE REQUIREMENTS in the labeling.
    (e) Spanish warning statements. If the product is classified as 
toxicity category I or toxicity category II according to the criteria in 
Sec. 156.62, the signal word shall appear in Spanish in addition to 
English followed by the statement, ``Si Usted no entiende la etiqueta, 
busque a alguien para que se la explique a Usted en detalle. (If you do 
not understand the label, find some one to explain it to you in 
detail.)'' The Spanish signal word ``PELIGRO'' shall be used for 
products in toxicity category I, and the Spanish signal word ``AVISO'' 
shall be used for products in toxicity category II. These statements 
shall appear on the label close to the English signal word.

73 FR 75596, Dec. 12, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 156.208  Restricted-entry statements.

    (a) Requirement. Each product with a restricted-entry interval shall 
bear the following statement: ``Do not enter or allow worker entry into 
treated areas during the restricted-entry interval (REI).'' This 
statement shall be under the heading AGRICULTURAL USE REQUIREMENTS in 
the labeling.
    (b) Location of specific restricted-entry interval statements. (1) 
If a product has one specific restricted-entry interval applicable to 
all registered uses of the product on agricultural plants, the 
restricted-entry interval for the product shall appear as a continuation 
of the statement required in paragraph (a) of this section and shall 
appear as follows: ``of X hours'' or ``of X days'' or ``until the 
acceptable exposure level of X ppm or mg/m\3\ is reached.''
    (2) If different restricted-entry intervals have been established 
for some crops or some uses of a product, the restricted-entry statement 
in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be associated on the labeling 
of the product with the directions for use for each crop each use to 
which it applies, immediately preceded or immediately followed by the 
words ``Restricted-entry interval'' (or the letters ``REI'').
    (c) Restricted-entry interval based on toxicity of active 
ingredient--(1) Determination of toxicity category. A restricted-entry 
interval shall be established based on the acute toxicity of the active 
ingredients in the product. For the purpose of setting the restricted-
entry interval, the toxicity category of each active ingredient in the 
product shall be determined by comparing the obtainable data on the 
acute dermal toxicity, eye irritation effects, and skin irritation 
effects of the ingredient to the criteria of Sec. 156.62. The most 
toxic of the applicable toxicity categories that are obtainable for each 
active ingredient shall be used to determine the restricted-entry 
interval for that product. If no acute dermal toxicity data are 
obtainable, data on acute oral toxicity also shall be considered in this 
comparison. If no applicable acute toxicity data are obtainable on the 
active ingredient, the toxicity category corresponding to the signal 
word of any registered manufacturing-use product that is the source of 
the active ingredient in the end-use product shall be used. If no acute 
toxicity data are obtainable on the active ingredients and no toxicity 
category of a registered manufacturing-use product is obtainable, the 
toxicity category of the end-use product (corresponding to the signal 
word on its labeling) shall be used.
    (2) Restricted-entry interval for sole active ingredient products. 
(i) If the product contains only one active ingredient and it is in 
toxicity category I by the criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, 
the restricted-entry interval shall be 48 hours. If, in addition, the 
active ingredient is an organophosphorus ester that inhibits 
cholinesterase and that may be applied outdoors in an

[[Page 79]]

area where the average annual rainfall for the application site is less 
than 25 inches per year, the following statement shall be added to the 
restricted-entry interval statement: ``(72 hours in outdoor areas where 
average annual rainfall is less than 25 inches a year).''
    (ii) If the product contains only one active ingredient and it is in 
toxicity category II by the criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, the restricted-entry interval shall be 24 hours.
    (iii) If the product contains only active ingredients that are in 
toxicity category III or IV by the criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, the restricted-entry interval shall be 12 hours.
    (3) Restricted-entry interval for multiple active ingredient 
products. If the product contains more than one active ingredient, the 
restricted-entry interval (including any associated statement concerning 
use in arid areas under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section) shall be 
based on the active ingredient that requires the longest restricted-
entry interval as determined by the criteria in this section.
    (d) Exception for fumigants. The criteria for determining 
restricted-entry intervals in paragraph (c) of this section shall not 
apply to any product that is a fumigant. For fumigants, any existing 
restricted-entry interval (hours, days, or acceptable exposure level) 
shall be retained. Entry restrictions for fumigants have been or shall 
be established on a case-by-case basis at the time of registration, 
reregistration, or other Agency review process.
    (e) Existing product-specific restricted-entry intervals. (1) A 
product-specific restricted-entry interval, based on data collected in 
accordance with Sec. 158.1070 or Sec. 161.390 of this chapter and 
Subdivision K of the Pesticide Assessment Guidelines, shall supersede 
any restricted-entry interval applicable to the product under paragraph 
(c) of this section.
    (2) Product-specific restricted-entry intervals established for 
pesticide products or pesticide uses that are not covered by part 170 of 
this chapter shall remain in effect and shall not be placed under the 
heading AGRICULTURAL USE REQUIREMENTS in the labeling.
    (f) Existing interim restricted-entry intervals. (1) An interim 
restricted-entry interval established by the Agency before the effective 
date of this subpart will continue to apply unless a longer restricted-
entry interval is required by paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) Existing interim restricted-entry intervals established by the 
Agency for pesticide products or pesticide uses not covered by part 170 
of this chapter shall remain in effect and shall not be placed under the 
heading AGRICULTURAL USE REQUIREMENTS in the labeling.

<R05>
Sec. 156.210  Notification-to-workers statements.

    (a) Requirement. Each product that meets the requirements of 
paragraph (b) of this section shall bear the posting and oral 
notification statements prescribed below. The statements shall be in the 
DIRECTIONS FOR USE section of the labeling under the heading 
AGRICULTURAL USE REQUIREMENTS.
    (b) Notification to workers of pesticide application. (1) Each 
product that contains any active ingredient classified as toxicity 
category I for either acute dermal toxicity or skin irritation potential 
under the criteria in Sec. 156.62 shall bear the statement: ``Notify 
workers of the application by warning them orally and by posting warning 
signs at entrances to treated areas.'' If no acute dermal toxicity data 
are obtainable, data on acute oral toxicity of the active ingredient 
shall be considered instead. If no data on acute dermal toxicity, skin 
irritation potential, or acute oral toxicity are obtainable on the 
active ingredient, the toxicity category corresponding to the signal 
word of any registered manufacturing-use product that is the source of 
the active ingredient in the end-use product shall be used. If none of 
the applicable acute toxicity data are obtainable on the active 
ingredient and no toxicity category of the registered manufacturing-use 
product is obtainable, the toxicity category of the end-use product 
corresponding to the product's signal word shall be used.

[[Page 80]]

    (2) Each product that is a fumigant and is registered for use in a 
greenhouse (or whose labeling allows use in a greenhouse) shall bear the 
statement: ``For greenhouse applications, notify workers of the 
application by warning them orally and by posting warning signs outside 
all entrances to the greenhouse.''

[57 FR 38146, Aug. 21, 1992, as amended at 58 FR 34203, June 23, 1993;

<R05>
Sec. 156.212  Personal protective equipment statements.

    (a) Requirement. Each product shall bear the personal protective 
equipment statements prescribed in paragraphs (d) through (j) of this 
section.
    (b) Exceptions. (1) If personal protective equipment were required 
for a product before the effective date of this subpart, the existing 
requirements shall be retained on the labeling wherever they are more 
specific or more protective (as specified in EPA guidance materials) 
than the requirements in the table in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (2) Any existing labeling statement that prohibits the use of gloves 
or boots overrides the corresponding requirement in paragraph (e) of 
this section and must be retained on the labeling.
    (3) If the product labeling contains uses that are not covered by 
part 170 of this chapter, the registrant may adopt the personal 
protective equipment required in this section for those uses. However, 
if the personal protective equipment required in this section would not 
be sufficiently protective or would be onerously overprotective for uses 
not covered by part 170 of this chapter, the registrant must continue to 
apply the existing personal protective equipment requirements to those 
uses. The labeling must indicate which personal protective equipment 
requirements apply to uses covered by part 170 of this chapter and which 
personal protective equipment requirements apply to other uses.
    (c) Location of personal protective equipment statements--(1) 
Personal protective equipment statements for pesticide handlers. 
Personal protective equipment statements for pesticide handlers shall be 
in the HAZARDS TO HUMANS (AND DOMESTIC ANIMALS) section of the labeling. 
The required statements may be combined to avoid redundancy as long as 
the requirements and conditions under which they apply are identified.
    (2) Personal protective equipment statements for early-entry 
workers. Personal protective equipment statements for early-entry 
workers shall be placed in the DIRECTIONS FOR USE section of the 
labeling under the heading AGRICULTURAL USE REQUIREMENTS and immediately 
after the restricted-entry statement required in Sec. 156.208(a).
    (d) Personal protective equipment statements for pesticide handlers. 
(1) The table in paragraph (e) of this section specifies minimum 
requirements for personal protective equipment (as defined in Sec. 
170.240 of this chapter) and work clothing for pesticide handlers. This 
personal protective equipment requirement applies to any product that 
presents a hazard through any route of exposure identified in the table 
(acute dermal toxicity, skin irritation potential, acute inhalation 
toxicity, and eye irritation potential).
    (2) The requirement for personal protective equipment is based on 
the acute toxicity category of the end-use product for each route of 
exposure as defined by Sec. 156.62. If data to determine the acute 
dermal toxicity or the acute inhalation toxicity are not obtainable, the 
acute oral toxicity shall be used as a surrogate to determine the 
personal protective equipment requirements for that route of exposure. 
If data to determine the acute toxicity of the product by a specific 
route of exposure (including acute oral toxicity in lieu of acute dermal 
or acute inhalation toxicity) are not obtainable, the toxicity category 
corresponding to the signal word of the end-use product shall be used to 
determine personal protective equipment requirements for that route of 
exposure. If the signal word is ``CAUTION,'' toxicity category III will 
be used.
    (3) The minimum personal protective equipment and work clothing 
requirements specified in this section shall be

[[Page 81]]

included in a statement such as the following: ``Applicators and other 
handlers must wear: (body protection statement); (glove statement, if 
applicable); (footwear statement, if applicable); (protective eyewear 
statement, if applicable); (respirator statement, if applicable).'' The 
format of statements given in this paragraph is optional, but it is 
recommended for clarity.
    (e) Summary of personal protective equipment requirements. The 
following table 1 summarizes the personal protective equipment 
requirements by route of exposure and toxicity category:

\3\ For labeling language for respiratory protection device, see paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section.
\4\ Although no minimum PPE is required by this section for this toxicity category and route of exposure, the
  Agency may require PPE on a product-specific basis.

    (f) Chemical-resistant gloves labeling statements for pesticide 
handlers. If the table in paragraph (e) of this section indicates that 
chemical-resistant gloves are required, the glove statement shall be as 
specified in paragraph (f)(2), (3), (4), or (5) of this section.
    (1) Exception. The registrant shall specify a glove type other than 
that selected through the criteria in paragraphs (f)(2) through (5) of 
this section if information available to the registrant indicates that 
such a glove type is more appropriate or more protective than the glove 
type specified in this section. The statement must specify the 
particular types of chemical-resistant glove (such as nitrile, butyl, 
neoprene, and/or barrier-laminate).
    (2) Solid formulations. For products formulated and applied as 
solids or formulated as solids and diluted solely with water for 
application, the glove statement shall specify: ``waterproof gloves.''
    (3) Aqueous-based formulations. For products formulated and applied 
as a water-based liquid or formulated as a water-based liquid and 
diluted solely with water for application, the glove statement may 
specify: ``waterproof gloves'' instead of the statement in paragraph 
(f)(4) of this section.
    (4) Other liquid formulations. For products formulated or diluted 
with liquids other than water, the glove statement shall specify: 
``chemical-resistant (such as nitrile or butyl) gloves.''
    (5) Gaseous formulations and applications. For products formulated 
or applied as gases, any existing glove statement established before the 
effective date of this subpart, including any glove prohibition 
statement, will continue to apply. If no glove statement or glove 
prohibition now exists, the glove statement shall specify ``chemical-
resistant (such as nitrile or butyl) gloves.''
    (g) Existing respirator requirement for pesticide handlers on 
product labeling--(1) General requirement. If a statement placed on a 
product's labeling before the effective date of this subpart indicates 
that respiratory protection is required, that requirement for protection

[[Page 82]]

shall be retained. The statement must specify, or be amended to specify, 
one of the following respirator types and the appropriate MSHA/NIOSH 
approval number prefix:
    (i) Dust/mist filtering respirator with MSHA/NIOSH/ approval number 
prefix TC-21C; or
    (ii) Respirator with an organic-vapor-removing cartridge and a 
prefilter approved for pesticides with MSHA/NIOSH approval number prefix 
TC-23C or with a canister approved for pesticides with MSHA/NIOSH 
approval number prefix TC-14G; or
    (iii) Supplied-air respirator with MSHA/NIOSH approval number prefix 
TC-19C or self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) with MSHA/NIOSH 
approval number TC-13F.
    (2) Respirator type already specified on labeling. If the existing 
respiratory protection requirement specifies a respirator type, it shall 
be retained. The respirator statement must be revised, if necessary, to 
conform to the wording in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
    (3) Respirator type not already specified on labeling. If the 
existing respiratory protection requirement on product labeling does not 
specify a respirator type as listed in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, 
the specific respirator type shall be that required in the criteria in 
paragraphs (g)(3)(ii) through (vi) of this section.
    (i) Exception. The registrant shall specify a different type of 
respiratory protection device if information, such as vapor pressure 
value, is available to the registrant to indicate that the type of 
respiratory protection device selected through the criteria in 
paragraphs (g)(3)(ii) through (vi) of this section would not be 
adequately protective, or might increase risks to the user 
unnecessarily.
    (ii) Gases applied outdoors. For products that are formulated or 
applied as a gas (space and soil fumigants) and that may be used 
outdoors, the respiratory protection statement shall be: ``For handling 
activities outdoors, use either a respirator with an organic-vapor-
removing cartridge with a prefilter approved for pesticides (MSHA/NIOSH 
approval number prefix TC-23C), or a canister approved for pesticides 
(MSHA/NIOSH approval number prefix TC-14G).''
    (iii) Gases used in enclosed areas. For products that are formulated 
or applied as a gas (space and soil fumigants) and that may be used in 
greenhouses or other enclosed areas, the respiratory protection 
statement shall specify: ``For handling activities in enclosed areas, 
use either a supplied-air respirator with MSHA/NIOSH approval number 
prefix TC-19C, or a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) with MSHA/
NIOSH approval number TC-13F.''
    (iv) Solids. For products that are formulated and applied as solids, 
the respiratory protection statement shall specify: ``dust/mist 
filtering respirator (MSHA/NIOSH approval number prefix TC-21C).''
    (v) Liquids in toxicity category I. For products that are formulated 
or applied as liquids, and, as formulated, have an acute inhalation 
toxicity (or its surrogate as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section) in category I, the respiratory protection statement shall 
specify: ``either a respirator with an organic-vapor-removing cartridge 
with a prefilter approved for pesticides (MSHA/NIOSH approval number 
prefix TC-23C), or a canister approved for pesticides (MSHA/NIOSH 
approval number prefix 14G).''
    (vi) Liquids in toxicity category II. For products that are 
formulated or applied as liquids, and, as formulated, have an acute 
inhalation toxicity (or its surrogate as specified in paragraph (d)(2) 
of this section) in category II, the respiratory protection statement 
shall specify: ``For handling activities during (select uses applicable 
to the product: airblast, mistblower, pressure greater than 40 p.s.i. 
with fine droplets, smoke, mist, fog, aerosol or direct overhead) 
exposures, wear either a respirator with an organic-vapor-removing 
cartridge with a prefilter approved for pesticides (MSHA/NIOSH approval 
number prefix TC-23C), or a canister approved for pesticides (MSHA/NIOSH 
approval number prefix 14G). For all other exposures, wear a dust/mist 
filtering respirator (MSHA/NIOSH approval number prefix TC-21C).''
    (h) New respirator requirement established for pesticide handlers in 
this part--

[[Page 83]]

(1) General requirement. If the table in paragraph (e) of this section 
indicates a respiratory protection device is required, and existing 
product labeling has no respiratory protection requirement, the 
registrant shall add a respiratory protection statement that specifies 
a: ``dust/mist filtering respirator (MSHA/NIOSH approval number prefix 
TC-21C).''
    (2) Exception. The registrant shall specify a different type of 
respiratory protection device if information, such as vapor pressure 
value, is available to the registrant to indicate that the type of 
respiratory protection device required in paragraph (h)(1) of this 
section would not be adequately protective or might increase risks to 
the user unnecessarily.
    (i) Additional personal protective equipment requirements for 
pesticide handlers. In addition to the minimum personal protective 
equipment and work clothing requirements given in the table in paragraph 
(e) of this section, the labeling statement for any product in toxicity 
category I or II on the basis of dermal toxicity or skin irritation 
potential (or their surrogate as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section), shall include the following personal protective equipment 
instructions, additions, or substitutions as applicable:
    (1) If the product is not ready-to-use and there is no existing 
requirement for a chemical-resistant suit, the following statement shall 
be included: ``Mixers/Loaders: add a chemical-resistant apron.''
    (2) If the application of the product may result in overhead 
exposure to any handler (for example, applicator exposure during 
airblast spraying of orchards or flagger exposure during aerial 
application), the following statement shall be included: ``Overhead 
Exposure: wear chemical-resistant headgear.''
    (3) If any type of equipment other than the product container may be 
used to mix, load, or apply the product, and there is no requirement for 
a chemical-resistant protective suit, the following statement shall be 
included: ``For Cleaning Equipment: add a chemical-resistant apron.''
    (j) Personal protective equipment for early-entry workers. This 
paragraph specifies minimum requirements for personal protective 
equipment (as defined in Sec. 170.240 of this chapter) and work 
clothing for early-entry workers.
    (1) For all pesticide products, add the statement: ``For early entry 
to treated areas that is permitted under the Worker Protection Standard 
and that involves contact with anything that has been treated, such as 
plants, soil, or water, wear: (list the body protection, glove, 
footwear, protective eyewear, and protective headgear, if applicable, 
statements specified for applicators and other handlers, but omit any 
respiratory protection statement).''
    (2) If the body protection statement in the personal protective 
equipment requirement for handlers specifies a long-sleeved shirt and 
long pants, ``coveralls'' must be specified in the statement of personal 
protective equipment for early-entry workers.
    (3) If there is no statement requiring gloves and no prohibition 
against gloves for applicators and other handlers under the heading 
HAZARDS TO HUMANS (AND DOMESTIC ANIMALS) in the labeling, add a 
requirement for ``waterproof gloves'' in the statement of personal 
protective equipment for early-entry workers.

Subpart A [Reserved]


<R04>
                   Subpart B_Child-Resistant Packaging


<R05>
Sec. 157.20  General.

    This subpart prescribes requirements for child-resistant packaging 
of pesticide products and devices. The requirements are established 
under the authority of FIFRA section 25(a)(1), which authorizes the 
Administrator to issue regulations to carry out the purposes of the Act, 
and FIFRA section 25(c)(3), which authorizes the Administrator to 
establish standards with respect to the package, container or wrapping 
in which a pesticide or device is enclosed in order to protect children 
and adults from serious injury or illness resulting from accidental 
ingestion or contact with pesticides or devices regulated under the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 157.21  Definitions.

    Terms used in this subpart shall have the following meanings:
    Appropriate, when used with respect to child-resistant packaging, 
means that the packaging is chemically compatible with the pesticide 
contained therein.
    Child-resistant packaging means packaging that is designed and 
constructed to be significantly difficult for children under 5 years of 
age to open or obtain a toxic or harmful amount of the substance 
contained therein within a reasonable time, and that is not difficult 
for normal adults to use properly.
    Package or packaging means the immediate container or wrapping, 
including any attached closure(s), in which the pesticide is contained 
for distribution, sale, consumption, use or storage. The term does not 
include any shipping or bulk container used for transporting or 
delivering the pesticide unless it is the only such package.
    Practicable, when used with respect to child-resistant packaging, 
means that the packaging can be mass produced and can be used in 
assembly line production.
    Residential use means use of a pesticide or device:
    (1) Directly on humans or pets;
    (2) In, on, or around any structure, vehicle, article, surface or 
area associated with the household, including but not limited to areas 
such as non-agricultural outbuildings, non-commercial greenhouses, 
pleasure boats and recreational vehicles; or
    (3) In or around any preschool or day care facility.
    Technically feasible, when applied to child-resistant packaging, 
means that the technology exists to produce the child-resistant 
packaging for a particular pesticide.
    Unit packaging means a package that is labeled with directions to 
use the entire contents of the package in a single application.

[51 FR 21286, June 11, 1986, as amended at 73 FR 75596, Dec. 12, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 157.22  When required.

    Unless exempted under Sec. 157.24, a pesticide product must be 
distributed and sold in child-resistant packaging complying with Sec. 
157.32 if it meets both of the following criteria:
    (a) Toxicity criterion. Based upon testing with an appropriate test 
species, the product meets any of the following toxicity criteria:
    (1) The pesticide has an acute oral LD<INF>50</INF> of 1.5 g/kg or 
less;
    (2) The pesticide has an acute dermal LD<INF>50</INF> of 2000 mg/kg 
or less;
    (3) The pesticide has an acute inhalation LC<INF>50</INF> of 2 mg/
liter or less;
    (4) The pesticide is corrosive to the eye (causes irreversible 
destruction of ocular tissue) or causes corneal involvement or 
irritation persisting for 21 days or more;
    (5) The pesticide is corrosive to the skin (causes tissue 
destruction into the dermis and/or scarring) or causes severe skin 
irritation (severe erythema or edema) at 72 hours; or
    (6) The pesticide or device has such characteristics that, based 
upon human toxicological data, use history, accident data or such other 
evidence as is available, the Agency determines there is serious hazard 
of accidental injury or illness which child-resistant packaging could 
reduce; and
    (b) Use criterion. The product's labeling either directly recommends 
residential use or reasonably can be interpreted to permit residential 
use.

[[Page 85]]


<R05>
Sec. 157.24  Exemptions.

    (a) General exemptions. The Agency hereby exempts from the 
requirement for child-resistant packaging the following classes of 
products:
    (1) Products classified for restricted use. (i) A product restricted 
to use by or under the supervision of a certified applicator is not 
required to be distributed and sold in child-resistant packaging.
    (ii) Notwithstanding the exemption in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this 
section, the Agency may require the use of child-resistant packaging for 
a product classified for restricted use by or under the direct 
supervision of a certified applicator if the Agency determines that the 
product poses a risk of serious accidental injury or illness which 
child-resistant packaging could reduce. If the Agency makes such a 
determination, it will notify the registrant in writing and provide a 
short statement of the basis of its determination. The registrant will 
then have 30 days to request a hearing on the Agency's determination. 
Thereafter the Agency will decide whether to require the product to be 
distributed only in child-resistant packaging and will notify the 
registrant of its decision.
    (2) Products packaged in large sizes. (i) Except as provided by 
paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, a product is not required to be in 
child-resistant packaging if distributed and sold in the following 
sizes:
    (A) If the product is a solid product, regardless of pesticide type, 
a size of 50 pounds or greater;
    (B) If the product is a liquid product intended for use in swimming 
pools, a size greater than 7.5 gallons by volume;
    (C) If the product is a liquid product intended for any other 
pesticide use, a size of 5 gallons or greater by volume;
    (D) If the product is packaged as an aerosol (measured by weight), 
regardless of pesticide type, a weight of 2 pounds or greater.
    (ii) The Agency may require that a product packaged in a size 
exceeding that listed in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) (A) through (D) of this 
section be distributed and sold only in child-resistant packaging if the 
Agency determines that the product is, or is intended to be, distributed 
or sold to homeowners or other members of the general public. If the 
Agency makes such a determination, it will notify the registrant in 
writing and provide a short statement of the basis of its determination. 
The registrant will then have 30 days to request a hearing on the 
Agency's determination. Thereafter the Agency will decide whether to 
require the product to be distributed only in child-resistant packaging 
and will notify the registrant of its decision.
    (b) Exemptions requiring Agency approval. The Agency may, in 
accordance with paragraphs (b) (1) through (3) of this section, grant an 
exemption from the requirements of this subpart. An exemption may be 
withdrawn in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (1) Requesting an exemption. A request for an exemption must be 
submitted to the Agency, and must be accompanied by two copies of the 
following information:
    (i) The name, address, and telephone number of the requester;
    (ii) The name and registration number (or file symbol) of the 
product(s) for which the exemption is requested;
    (iii) A description of the package and the size(s) for which the 
exemption is requested; and
    (iv) Documentation supporting the request for exemption, including 
the length of time for which the exemption is requested.
    (2) Exemption based upon lack of toxicity. The Agency may grant an 
exemption from the requirements of this subpart if the registrant or 
applicant demonstrates to the Agency's satisfaction that the hazards 
indicated by the toxicity criteria in Sec. 157.22(a) are not indicative 
of the hazards to man. If granted, an exemption shall apply to other 
products of substantially similar composition. A notice will be issued 
in the Federal Register stating the nature of and reasons for the 
exemption.
    (3) Exemption based upon technical factors. The Agency may grant an 
exemption from the requirements of this subpart based upon technical 
considerations. If granted, the exemption will be for a specified length 
of time, and will apply to other products of substantially similar 
composition and intended uses. A notice of the granting of

[[Page 86]]

an exemption will be issued in the Federal Register. In considering 
whether to grant an exemption, the Agency will consider, among other 
things, the following:
    (i) Whether the toxicity of the product is such that it should not 
be allowed to be distributed or sold except in child-resistant 
packaging.
    (ii) Whether child-resistant packaging is technically feasible, 
practicable, or appropriate. An exemption may be granted if the Agency 
determines that any one of these criteria has not been met.
    (iii) Whether the composition or use pattern of the product 
necessitates a particular form of packaging for proper use.
    (iv) Whether child-resistant packaging that is technically feasible, 
practicable, and appropriate is available for the product or can 
reasonably be made available to the registrant in sufficient quantities 
to meet his packaging needs. This determination does not include a 
consideration of whether the packaging would be adaptable to a 
registrant's existing package type or packaging equipment.
    (v) Whether the registrant has made a timely and good faith effort 
to obtain child-resistant packaging for the product.
    (vi) If child-resistant packaging which is technically feasible, 
practicable, and appropriate is not yet available, when such packaging 
is likely to be available.
    (4) An exemption may be withdrawn by the Agency at any time if the 
lack of child-resistant packaging results in serious illnesses or 
injuries to children. If the Agency determines that an exemption should 
be withdrawn, it will notify the registrant, stating the basis for its 
determination. The registrant will then have 30 days to request a 
hearing on the Agency's determination. Thereafter the Agency will decide 
whether to withdraw the exemption, and will notify the registrant of its 
decision.


<R05>
Sec. 157.27  Unit packaging.

    Pesticide products distributed or sold as an aggregate of one or 
more unit packages and meeting the criteria of Sec. 157.22 must be 
distributed or sold in child-resistant packaging either for each unit 
package or for the outer retail container which contains the unit 
packages. Child-resistant packaging is not required for both the outer 
package and the unit packages unless the Agency determines, on a case-
by-case basis, that it is necessary for risk reduction.


<R05>
Sec. 157.30  Voluntary use of child-resistant packaging.

    A registrant whose product is not required to be in child-resistant 
packaging may distribute or sell his pesticide product in child-
resistant packaging. If he does so, that packaging must meet the 
standards for child-resistant packaging stated in Sec. 157.32. The 
registrant must certify to this effect in accordance with Sec. 157.34, 
and must retain the records required by Sec. 157.36.


<R05>
Sec. 157.32  Standards.

    (a) Effectiveness standard. The child-resistant packaging, when 
tested by the protocol specified in 16 CFR 1700.20, shall meet the 
effectiveness specifications in 16 CFR 1700.15(b).
    (b) Compatibility standard. The child-resistant packaging must 
continue to meet the effectiveness specifications of paragraph (a) of 
this section when in actual use as a pesticide container. This 
requirement may be satisfied by appropriate scientific evaluation of the 
compatibility of the substance with the child-resistant packaging to 
determine that the chemical and physical characteristics of the 
pesticide will not compromise or interfere with the proper functioning 
of the child-resistant packaging and that the packaging will not be 
detrimental to the integrity of the product during storage and use.
    (c) Durability standard. The child-resistant packaging must continue 
to meet the effectiveness and compatibility standards of paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section for the reasonably expected lifetime of the 
package, taking into account the number of times the package is 
customarily opened and closed. This requirement may be satisfied by 
appropriate technical evaluation based on physical wear and stress 
factors of packaging, the force required for activation, and other 
relevant factors.

[[Page 87]]


<R05>
Sec. 157.34  Certification.

    (a) General. (1) The registrant of a pesticide product required to 
be in child-resistant packaging shall certify to the Agency that the 
package meets the standards of Sec. 157.32.
    (2) Certification must be submitted with each application for new 
registration, if applicable. If the Agency determines, in accordance 
with Sec. 157.24(a)(1)(ii), (2)(ii), or (b)(4), that a currently 
registered product is required to be packaged in child-resistant 
packaging, a certification must be submitted within 6 months after the 
Agency finally notifies the registrant of the requirement.
    (b) Contents of certification. The certification must contain the 
following information:
    (1) The name and EPA registration number of the product to which the 
certification applies, the registrant's name and address, the date, and 
the name, title and signature of the company official making the 
certification.
    (2) A statement that the packaging that is being used for the 
product will meet the standards of Sec. 157.32. The statement, ``I 
certify that the packaging that will be used for this product meets the 
standards of 40 CFR 157.32,'' will suffice for this purpose.


<R05>
Sec. 157.36  Recordkeeping.

    For as long as the registration of a pesticide product required to 
be in child-resistant packaging is in effect, the registrant must retain 
the records listed in this section. The registrant must, upon request by 
the Agency, make them available to Agency representatives for inspection 
and copying, or must submit them to the Agency.
    (a) A description of the package, including a description of:
    (1) The container and its dimensions and composition.
    (2) The closure or child-resistant mechanism, including the name of 
its manufacturer and the manufacturer's designation for the closure or 
the physical working of the child-resistant packaging mechanism.
    (b) A copy of the certification statement required by Sec. 157.34.
    (c) One of the following types of records verifying that each 
package for the product is child-resistant:
    (1) Test data on the package based on the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission protocol in 16 CFR 1700.20.
    (2) Test data, not conforming to the protocol in 16 CFR 1700.20, or 
a set of measurements on the package, together with an explanation as to 
why such data or measurements demonstrate that the package is child-
resistant.
    (3) Test data, whether or not conforming to the protocol in 16 CFR 
1700.20, on a different package, together with an explanation of why 
such data demonstrate that the package being used is child-resistant.
    (4) Written evidence that verifies that testing on the package has 
been conducted according to the protocol in 16 CFR 1700.20. Written 
evidence may be one of the following:
    (i) A letter or literature from the packaging supplier;
    (ii) A letter from the facility that conducted the testing; or
    (iii) A specification in the contract between the registrant or 
applicant and the packaging supplier;
    (5) When the container and closure are purchased separately by the 
registrant:
    (i) Information of the kinds described in paragraphs (c) (1) through 
(4) of this section showing that the closure is child-resistant; and
    (ii) A written explanation of why the container is child-resistant; 
and
    (iii) Information showing that the closure and container are 
compatible with each other, and a written explanation of why the 
resulting package is child-resistant.
    (6) A combination of the records listed in paragraphs (c) (1) 
through (5).
    (d) Records verifying that the package meets the compatibility and 
durability standards of Sec. 157.32(b) and (c).

<R05>
Sec. 158.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) Purpose. The purpose of this part is to specify the kinds of 
data and information EPA requires in order to make regulatory judgments 
under FIFRA secs. 3, 4, and 5 about the risks and benefits of pesticide 
products. Further, this part specifies the data and information needed 
to determine the safety of pesticide chemical residues under FFDCA sec. 
408.
    (b) Scope. (1) This part describes the minimum data and information 
EPA typically requires to support an application for pesticide 
registration or amendment; support the reregistration of a pesticide 
product; support the maintenance of a pesticide registration by means of 
the data call-in process, e.g., as used in the registration review 
program; or establish or maintain a tolerance or exemption from the 
requirements of a tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue.
    (2) This part establishes general policies and procedures associated 
with the submission of data in support of a pesticide regulatory action.
    (3) This part does not include study protocols, methodology, or 
standards for conducting or reporting test results; nor does this part 
describe how the Agency uses or evaluates the data and information in 
its risk assessment and risk management decisions, or the regulatory 
determinations that may be based upon the data.
    (c) Scope of individual subparts. (1) Conventional pesticides. 
Subparts A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, N, and O apply to conventional 
pesticides.

pesticides.
    (4) Antimicrobial pesticides. [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 158.3  Definitions.

    All terms defined in sec. 2 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, 
and Rodenticide Act apply to this part and

[[Page 90]]

are used with the meaning given in the Act. Applicable terms from the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act also apply to this part. Individual 
subparts may contain definitions that pertain solely to that subpart. 
The following additional terms apply to this part:
    Applicant means any person or entity, including for the purposes of 
this part a registrant, who submits, or is required to submit, to the 
Agency any application, petition, or submission intended to persuade EPA 
to grant, modify, or leave unmodified a registration or other approval 
required as a condition of sale or distribution of a pesticide. Such 
submissions may include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (1) An application for registration or amended registration of a 
pesticide product under FIFRA sec. 3 or 24.
    (2) A submission of data required in conjunction with reregistration 
of a currently registered product under FIFRA sec. 4.
    (3) An application for an experimental use permit under FIFRA sec. 
5.
    (4) A submission of data in response to a notice issued by EPA under 
FIFRA sec. 3(c)(2)(B).
    (5) A petition to establish or modify a tolerance or an exemption 
from the requirement of a tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue 
under FFDCA sec. 408.
    Registration includes a new registration, amended registration and 
reregistration, unless stated otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 158.5  Applicability.

    (a) The requirements of this part apply to the following 
submissions:
    (1) An application for new or amended registration under FIFRA sec. 
3 or 24.
    (2) An application for experimental use permit under FIFRA sec. 5.
    (3) A submission of data or information to support the continuation 
of a registration under FIFRA sec. 3, 4, or 24.
    (4) A petition to establish, modify or revoke a tolerance or 
exemption from a tolerance under FFDCA sec. 408.
    (b) The information specified in this part must be furnished with 
each submission described in paragraph (a) of this section if it has not 
been submitted previously, or if any previous submission is not accurate 
or complete.


<R05>
Sec. 158.30  Flexibility.

    (a) FIFRA provides EPA flexibility to require, or not require, data 
and information for the purposes of making regulatory judgments for 
pesticide products. EPA has the authority to establish or modify data 
needs for individual pesticide chemicals. The actual data required may 
be modified on an individual basis to fully characterize the use and 
properties, characteristics, or effects of specific pesticide products 
under review. The Agency encourages each applicant to consult with EPA 
to discuss the data requirements particular to its product prior to and 
during the registration process.
    (b) The Agency cautions applicants that the data routinely required 
in this part may not be sufficient to permit EPA to evaluate the 
potential of the product to cause unreasonable adverse effects to man or 
the environment. EPA may require the submission of additional data or 
information beyond that specified in this part if such data or 
information are needed to appropriately evaluate a pesticide product.
    (c) This part will be updated as needed to reflect evolving program 
needs and advances in science.


<R05>
Sec. 158.32  Format of data submissions.

    (a) General. (1) All data submitted under this part must be 
formatted in accordance with this section.
    (2) The requirements of this section do not apply to administrative 
materials accompanying a data submission, including forms, labeling, and 
correspondence.
    (b) Transmittal document. Each submission in support of a regulatory 
action must be accompanied by a transmittal document, which includes:
    (1) Identity of the submitter.

<R05>
Sec. 158.33  Confidential data.

    (a) Definitions. For the purposes of this section:
    (1) Registered or previously registered pesticide means any 
pesticide containing an active ingredient contained in a product that 
is, or has ever been, an active ingredient in a product registered under 
sec. 3 of FIFRA. A registered pesticide that is the subject of an 
application for a new use falls within the category of ``registered or 
previously registered pesticide.''
    (2) Safety and efficacy information means information concerning the 
objectives, methodology, results, or significance of any test or 
experiment performed on or with a registered or previously registered 
pesticide or its separate ingredients, impurities, or degradation 
products, and any information concerning the effects of such pesticide 
on any organism or the behavior of such pesticide in the environment, 
including, but not limited to, data on safety to fish and wildlife, 
humans and other mammals, plants, animals, and soil, and studies on 
persistence, translocation and fate in the environment, and metabolism.
    (b) Applicability. (1) This section applies to information submitted 
pursuant to this part. It supplements the general confidentiality 
procedures in 40 CFR part 2, subpart B, including FIFRA confidentiality 
procedures at 40 CFR 2.307. To the extent that provisions in this 
section conflict with those in 40 CFR part 2, subpart B, the provisions 
in this section take precedence. The provisions of 40 CFR 2.308 do not 
apply to information to which this section applies. In addition to 
complying with the requirements of this section, any confidentiality 
claims for information subject to 40 CFR part 174 (plant-incorporated 
protectants) must be substantiated at the time of submission as 
described in Sec. 174.9 of this chapter.
    (2) FFDCA sec. 408(i) protects confidential information submitted in 
connection with an application for a tolerance or exemption to the same 
extent as FIFRA sec. 10. References in this section to FIFRA sec. 10 are 
deemed to apply equally to information submitted pursuant to FFDCA sec. 
408, pursuant to the authority in sec. 408(i).
    (c) Method of asserting business confidentiality claims--(1) Claim 
required. Information to which this section applies (and which is 
submitted on or after the effective date of this regulation) will be 
deemed as not subject to a confidentiality claim unless a claim for that 
information is made in accordance with the procedures specified in this 
paragraph. Information not subject to a confidentiality claim may be 
made available to the public without further notice, subject to the 
requirements of FIFRA sec. 10(g).

[[Page 92]]

    (2) Statement required. Upon submission to EPA, each document must 
be accompanied by a signed and dated document containing either the 
statements in paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section. No claims or 
markings on the document or any attachments, other than these statements 
and attachments submitted in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section, will be recognized as asserting a claim of confidentiality. The 
format of data submissions is set forth in Sec. 158.32.
    (i) No claim of confidentiality.
    No claim of confidentiality, on any basis whatsoever, is made for 
any information contained in this document. I acknowledge that 
information not designated as within the scope of FIFRA sec. 
10(d)(1)(A), (B), or (C) and which pertains to a registered or 
previously registered pesticide is not entitled to confidential 
treatment and may be released to the public, subject to the provisions 
regarding disclosure to multinational entities under FIFRA sec. 10(g).
    (ii) Claim of confidentiality.
    Information claimed as confidential has been removed to a 
confidential attachment.
    (3) Confidential attachment. (i) All information claimed as 
confidential must be submitted in a separate confidential attachment to 
the document and cross referenced to the specific location in the 
document from which it was removed. The confidential attachment must 
have its own title page and be paginated separately from the non-
confidential document.
    (ii) All information in the confidential attachment that consists of 
(or whose disclosure would in turn disclose) manufacturing or quality 
control processes must be individually identified in the confidential 
attachment as a claim for information within the scope of FIFRA sec. 
10(d)(1)(A).
    (iii) All information in the confidential attachment that consists 
of (or whose disclosure would in turn disclose) the details of any 
methods for testing, detecting, or measuring the quantity of any 
deliberately added inert ingredient of a pesticide, must be individually 
identified in the confidential attachment as a claim for information 
within the scope of FIFRA sec. 10(d)(1)(B).
    (iv) All information in the confidential attachment that consists of 
(or whose disclosure would in turn disclose) the identity or percentage 
quantity of any deliberately added inert ingredient of a pesticide must 
be individually identified in the confidential attachment as a claim for 
information within the scope of FIFRA sec. 10(d)(1)(C).
    (v) Information in the confidential attachment that is designated in 
accordance with paragraphs (c)(3)(ii) - (iv) of this section must be on 
a separate page from information that is not so designated.
    (4) Voluntary release of information to States and foreign 
governments. (i) Submitters are encouraged to include with the statement 
required under paragraph (c)(2) of this section an additional statement 
to allow EPA to share information with State and foreign governments. 
EPA will not consider such a statement to be a waiver of confidentiality 
or proprietary claims for the information. The statement is as follows:
    I authorize the Environmental Protection Agency to release any 
information contained in this document to State or foreign governments, 
without relinquishing proprietary rights or any confidentiality claims 
asserted above.
    (ii) Information designated as releasable to state or foreign 
governments in accordance with this section may be released to such a 
government without further notice to the submitter. EPA will inform the 
State or foreign government of any of the confidentiality claims 
associated with the information.
    (d) Release of information. (1) Safety and efficacy information that 
was submitted to EPA on or after May 4, 1988 and that has not been 
designated by the submitter as FIFRA sec. 10(d)(1)(A), (B), or (C) 
information in accordance with the applicable requirements of this 
section is not entitled to confidential treatment and may be disclosed 
to the public without further notice to the submitter, in accordance 
with paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Safety and efficacy information 
which has been designated by the submitter as FIFRA sec. 10(d)(1) (A), 
(B), or (C) information is entitled to confidential treatment only to 
the extent provided by FIFRA sec. 10(b), this section, and 40 CFR 2.208.

[[Page 93]]

    (2) Information that is not entitled to be protected as confidential 
in accordance with FIFRA sec. 10(b), this section and with EPA 
confidentiality regulations at 40 CFR part 2, subpart B, may be released 
to the public without the affirmation of non-multinational status 
provided under FIFRA sec. 10(g), provided that the information does not 
contain or consist of any complete unpublished report submitted to EPA, 
or excerpts or restatements of any such report which reveal the full 
methodology and complete results of the study, test, or experiment, and 
all explanatory information necessary to understand the methodology or 
interpret the results.

Sec. 158.45  Waivers.

    (a) The data requirements specified in this part as applicable to a 
category of products will not always be appropriate for every product in 
that category. Some products may have unusual physical, chemical, or 
biological properties or atypical use patterns which would make 
particular data requirements inappropriate, either because it would not 
be possible to generate the required data or because the data would not 
be useful in the Agency's evaluation of the risks or benefits of the 
product. The Agency will waive data requirements it finds are 
inappropriate, but will ensure that sufficient data are available to 
make the determinations required by the applicable statutory standards.
    (b)(1) Applicants are encouraged to discuss a data waiver request 
with the Agency before developing and submitting supporting data, 
information, or other materials.
    (2) All waiver requests must be submitted to the Agency in writing. 
The request must clearly identify the data requirement(s) for which a 
waiver is sought along with an explanation and supporting rationale why 
the applicant believes the data requirement should be waived. In 
addition, the applicant must describe any unsuccessful attempts to 
generate the required data, furnish any other information which the 
applicant(s) believe(s) would support the request, and when appropriate, 
suggest alternative means of obtaining data to address the concern which 
underlies the data requirement.
    (c) The Agency will review each waiver request and subsequently 
inform the applicant in writing of its decision. If the decision could 
apply to more than the requested product, the Agency, in its discretion, 
may choose to send a notice to all registrants or publish a notice in 
the Federal Register announcing the decision. An Agency decision denying 
a written request to waive a data requirement is a final Agency action.

Sec. 158.60  Minor use data policies.

    FIFRA sec. 2(ll) defines the term ``minor use''and FIFRA provides a 
number of statutory provisions concerning minor uses. In addition, EPA 
has established policies with respect to minor uses of pesticides, 
including, but not limited to, the following:
    (a) A new data requirement pertinent to both an unregistered minor 
use and a registered major use will not be applied to a minor use 
applicant until it is applied to the major use registration.
    (b) EPA will accept appropriate and adequate extrapolations and 
regional data to support establishment of individual minor use 
tolerances.


<R05>
Sec. 158.70  Satisfying data requirements.

    (a) General policy. The Agency will determine whether the data 
submitted or cited to fulfill the data requirements specified in this 
part are acceptable. This determination will be based on the design and 
conduct of the experiment from which the data were derived, and an 
evaluation of whether the data fulfill the purpose(s) of the data 
requirement. In evaluating experimental design, the Agency will consider 
whether generally accepted methods were used, sufficient numbers of 
measurements were made to achieve statistical reliability, and 
sufficient controls were built into all phases of the experiment. The 
Agency will evaluate the conduct of each experiment in terms of whether 
the study was conducted in conformance with the design, good laboratory 
practices were observed, and results were reproducible. The Agency will 
not reject data merely because they were derived from studies which, 
when initiated, were in accordance with an Agency-recommended protocol, 
even if the Agency subsequently recommends a different protocol, as long 
as the data fulfill the purposes of the requirements as described in 
this paragraph.
    (1) The provisions in this part 158 should be read in conjunction 
with the

[[Page 95]]

provisions in Sec. 152.85 to claim eligibility for the formulators' 
exemption.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (b) Good laboratory practices. Applicants must adhere to the good 
laboratory practice (GLP) standards described in 40 CFR part 160 when 
conducting studies. Applicants must also adhere to GLP standards when 
conducting a study in support of a waiver request of any data 
requirement which is within the scope of the GLP requirements.
    (c) Agency guidelines. EPA has published Test Guidelines that 
contain standards for conducting acceptable tests, guidance on the 
evaluation and reporting of data, definition of terms, and suggested 
study protocols. Copies of the Test Guidelines may be obtained by 
visiting the agency's website at www.epa.gov/pesticides.
    (d) Study protocols--(1) General. Any appropriate protocol may be 
used to generate the data required by this part, provided that it meets 
the purpose of the test standards specified in the pesticide assessment 
guidelines, and provides data of suitable quality and completeness as 
typified by the protocols cited in the guidelines. Applicants should use 
the test procedure which is most suitable for evaluation of the 
particular ingredient, mixture, or product. Accordingly, failure to 
follow a suggested protocol will not invalidate a test if another 
appropriate methodology is used.
    (2) Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) 
protocols. Tests conducted in accordance with the requirements and 
recommendations of the applicable OECD protocols can be used to develop 
data necessary to meet the requirements specified in this part. 
Applicants should note, however, that certain of the OECD recommended 
test standards, such as test duration and selection of test species, are 
less restrictive than those recommended by EPA. Therefore, when using 
OECD protocols, care should be taken to observe the test standards in a 
manner such that the data generated by the study will satisfy the 
requirements of this part.
    (e) Combining studies. Certain toxicology studies may be combined to 
satisfy data requirements. For example, carcinogenicity studies in rats 
may be combined with the rat chronic toxicity study. Combining 
appropriate studies may be expected to reduce usage of test animals as 
well as reduce the cost of studies. EPA encourages this practice by 
including standards for acceptable combined tests in the Pesticide 
Assessment Guidelines. Registrants and applicants are encouraged to 
consider combining other tests when practical and likely to produce 
scientifically acceptable results. Registrants and applicants, however, 
must consult with the EPA before initiating combined studies.


<R05>
Sec. 158.75  Requirements for additional data.

    The data routinely required by this part may not be sufficient to 
permit EPA to evaluate every pesticide product. If the information 
required under this part is not sufficient to evaluate the potential of 
the product to cause unreasonable adverse effects on man or the 
environment, additional data requirements will be imposed. However, EPA 
expects that the information required by this part will be adequate in 
most cases for an assessment of the properties and effects of the 
pesticide.


<R05>
Sec. 158.80  Use of other data.

    (a) Data developed in foreign countries. With certain exceptions, 
laboratory and field study data developed outside the United States may 
be submitted in support of a pesticide registration. Data generated in a 
foreign country which the Agency will not consider include, but are not 
limited to, data from tests which involved field test sites or a test 
material, such as a native soil, plant, or animal, that is not 
characteristic of the United States. Applicants submitting foreign data 
must take steps to ensure that U.S. materials are used, or be prepared 
to supply data or information to demonstrate the lack of substantial or 
relevant differences between the selected material or test site and the 
U.S. material or test site. Once submitted, the Agency will determine 
whether or not the data meet the data requirements.
    (b) Data generated for other purposes. Data developed for purposes 
other than satisfaction of FIFRA data requirements, such as monitoring 
studies,

[[Page 96]]

may also satisfy data requirements in this part. Consultation with the 
Agency should be arranged if applicants are unsure about suitability of 
such data.


<R04>
                    Subpart B_How To Use Data Tables


<R05>
Sec. 158.100  Pesticide use patterns.

    (a) General use patterns. There are six broad use categories used in 
the data tables. The six broad categories include terrestrial outdoor 
uses, aquatic outdoor uses, greenhouse uses, forestry uses, residential 
outdoor uses, and indoor uses of all types. The 6 broad use categories 
are further subdivided into 12 general use patterns which are the bases 
for data requirements established by use pattern. Within the data 
tables, general use patterns have been combined into single columns when 
the data requirements are the same for the combined uses. If there are 
no data requirements for a specific use, the column for that use is not 
included in the table. The 12 general use pattern groups used in the 
data table in this part are:
    (1) Terrestrial food crop use.
    (2) Terrestrial feed crop use.
    (3) Terrestrial nonfood crop use.
    (4) Aquatic food crop use.
    (5) Aquatic nonfood use.
    (6) Greenhouse food crop use.
    (7) Greenhouse nonfood crop use.
    (8) Forestry use.
    (9) Residential outdoor use.
    (10) Residential indoor use.
    (11) Indoor food use.
    (12) Indoor nonfood use.
    (b) Pesticide use site index. The Pesticide Use Site Index is a 
comprehensive list of specific pesticide use sites. The index is 
alphabetized separately by site for all agricultural and all 
nonagricultural uses. The Pesticide Use Site Index associates each 
pesticide use site with one or more of the 12 general use patterns. It 
may be used in conjunction with the data tables to determine the 
applicability of data requirements to specific uses. The Pesticide Use 
Site Index, which will be updated periodically, is available from the 
Agency or may be obtained from the Agency's website at http://
www.epa.gov/pesticides.
    (c) Applicants unsure of the correct use pattern for their 
particular product should consult the Agency.


<R05>
Sec. 158.110  Required and conditionally required data.

    The tables in this part use the descriptors R (required), CR 
(conditionally required), and NR (not required) as a general indication 
of the applicability of a data requirement. In all cases, the test notes 
referred to in the table must be consulted to determine the actual 
applicability of the data requirement.
    (a) EPA requires data designated as ``required''(R) for products 
with a given use pattern in order to evaluate the risks or benefits of a 
product having that use pattern under any conditions established by the 
test notes.
    (b) Data designated as ``conditionally required'' (CR) for products 
with a given use pattern are required by EPA to evaluate the risks or 
benefits of a product having that use pattern if the product meets the 
conditions specified in the notes accompanying the requirement. The 
determination of whether the data must be submitted is based on the 
product's use pattern, physical or chemical properties, expected 
exposure of nontarget organisms, and/or results of previous testing (for 
example, tier testing). Applicants must evaluate each applicable test 
note for the conditions and criteria to be considered in determining 
whether conditionally required data must be submitted.
    (c) Data not required for the Agency's assessment of the risks and 
benefits of a particular use pattern are designated ``not required'' 
(NR) in data tables.


<R05>
Sec. 158.120  Determining data requirements.

    As with current practice, the actual data and studies required may 
be modified on an individual basis to fully characterize the use and 
properties of specific pesticide products under review. While EPA is 
attempting to assist the applicant in this subpart, it is important to 
emphasize that it is the applicant's obligation under FIFRA to 
demonstrate that an individual product meets the standard under FIFRA 
and/or FFDCA. Accordingly, applicants are

[[Page 97]]

encouraged to consult with the Agency on the appropriate data 
requirements as set forth here as they relate to their specific product 
prior to and during the registration process.
    (a) Finding the appropriate data table. (1) Pesticide data 
requirements for conventional chemical active ingredients and related 
substances are presented in subparts D, E, F, G, K, L, N, and O of this 
part in the form of a series of data tables, each addressing a 
particular scientific discipline or data topic. Data requirements for 
biochemical and microbial pest control agents are contained and are 
described separately within subparts U and V of this part, respectively.
    (2) Key to table notations. R = required data; CR = conditionally 
required data; NR = Not required; MP = manufacturing-use product; EP = 
end-use product; TEP = typical end-use product; TGAI = technical grade 
of the active ingredient; PAI = pure active ingredient; PAIRA = pure 
active ingredient, radiolabeled; Choice = choice of several test 
substances depending on studies required.
    (b) Identifying required studies. To determine the specific kinds of 
data needed to support the registration use of each pesticide product, 
the applicant may:
    (1) Refer to the applicable subpart(s) of this part. These subparts 
describe the data requirements including data tables for each subject 
area.
    (2) Select the general use pattern(s) that best cover the use 
pattern(s) specified on the pesticide product label as explained in 
Sec. 158.100. All applicable use patterns must be included.
    (3) Proceed down the appropriate general use pattern column in the 
table and note which tests are required (R), conditionally required 
(CR), or not required (NR). Required and conditionally required studies 
are described in Sec. 158.110.
    (4) Review the notes for each requirement to determine its 
applicability to the specific product proposed for registration.
    (5)(i) Proceed down the Test substance columns and determine the 
appropriate test substance needed for that study. If the data are 
intended to support a manufacturing-use product, use the MP column. If 
the data are intended to support an end-use product, use the EP column.
    (ii) The test substances columns specify which substance is to be 
used for testing. Applicants should note that the substance that must be 
used when performing the study may or may not be the product itself. For 
example, the data from a certain study may be required to support the 
registration of an end-use product, but the test substance column may 
state that the particular test shall be performed using the technical 
grade of the active ingredient(s) in the end-use product.
    (iii) Manufacturing-use products (MP) and end-use products (EP) 
containing a single active ingredient and no intentionally added inert 
ingredients are considered identical in composition to each other, and 
to the technical grade of the active ingredient (TGAI) from which they 
were derived. Therefore, the data from a test conducted using any one of 
these as the test substance is also suitable to meet the requirement (if 
any) for the same test to be conducted using either of the other 
substances.
    (6) Refer to the Pesticide Assessment Guideline reference number for 
each study located in the first column. See Sec. 158.70(c) for 
information pertaining to the guidelines and how to obtain copies.


<R05>
Sec. 158.130  Purposes of the registration data requirements.

    (a) General. The data requirements for registration are intended to 
generate data and information necessary to address concerns pertaining 
to the identity, composition, potential adverse effects and 
environmental fate of each pesticide.
    (b) Product chemistry--(1) Product composition. Data on product 
composition are needed:
    (i) To support the conclusions expressed in the statement of 
formula;
    (ii) To compare to the composition of materials used in required 
testing under this part; and
    (iii) To determine whether a product is ``identical or substantially 
similar''to another product, a determination that involves the 
comparison of product composition.

[[Page 98]]

    (2) Nominal concentration and certified limits. The nominal 
concentration of a product, defined as that concentration that is 
expected to be present in a product as a result of the production or 
formulation process, is used to gauge the acceptability of the certified 
limits, which define the outer limits of the range of the product's 
ingredients. The certified limits are used to enforce the composition of 
the product and to ensure the accuracy of hazard assessments.
    (3) Physical and chemical characteristics. The physical and chemical 
characteristics of an active ingredient or product are used:
    (i) To confirm or provide supportive information on the identity and 
composition of the product;
    (ii) To assess the hazards of the ingredient or product; and
    (iii) To trigger or evaluate certain other studies required by this 
part.
    (c) Product performance. Requirements to develop data on product 
performance provide a mechanism to ensure that pesticide products will 
perform as intended and that unnecessary pesticide exposure to the 
environment will not occur as a result of the use of ineffective 
products. Specific performance standards are used to validate the 
efficacy data in the public health areas, including disinfectants used 
to control microorganisms infectious to man in any area of the inanimate 
environment and those pesticides used to control vertebrates (such as 
rodents, birds, bats and skunks) that may directly or indirectly 
transmit diseases to humans.
    (d) Toxicology-humans and domestic animals. Data required to assess 
hazards to humans and domestic animals are derived from a variety of 
acute, subchronic and chronic toxicity tests, and tests to assess 
mutagenicity and pesticide metabolism.
    (1) Acute studies. Determination of acute oral, dermal and 
inhalation toxicity is usually the initial step in the assessment and 
evaluation of the toxic characteristics of a pesticide. These data 
provide information on health hazards likely to arise soon after, and as 
a result of, short-term exposure. Data from acute studies serve as a 
basis for classification and precautionary labeling. For example, acute 
toxicity data are used to calculate farmworker reentry intervals and to 
develop precautionary label statements pertaining to protective clothing 
requirements for applicators. They also provide information used in 
establishing the appropriate dose levels in subchronic and other 
studies; provide initial information on the mode of toxic action(s) of a 
substance; and determine the need for child resistant packaging. 
Information derived from primary eye and primary dermal irritation 
studies serves to identify possible hazards from exposure of the eyes, 
associated mucous membranes and skin.
    (2) Subchronic studies. Subchronic tests provide information on 
health hazards that may arise from repeated exposures over a limited 
period of time. They provide information on target organs and 
accumulation potential. The resulting data are also useful in selecting 
dose levels for chronic studies and for establishing safety criteria for 
human exposure. These tests are not capable of detecting those effects 
that have a long latency period for expression (e.g., carcinogenicity).
    (3) Chronic studies. Chronic toxicity studies (usually conducted by 
feeding the test substance to the test species) are intended to 
determine the effects of a substance in a mammalian species following 
prolonged and repeated exposure. Under the conditions of this test, 
effects which have a long latency period or are cumulative should be 
detected. The purpose of long-term carcinogenicity studies is to observe 
test animals over most of their life span for the development of 
neoplastic lesions during or after exposure to various doses of a test 
substance by an appropriate route of administration.
    (4) Developmental toxicity and reproduction studies. The 
developmental toxicity study is designed to determine the potential of 
the test substance to induce structural and/or other abnormalities to 
the fetus as the result of exposure of the mother during pregnancy. Two-
generation reproduction testing is designed to provide information 
concerning the general effects of a test substance on gonadal function, 
estrus cycles, mating behavior, conception, parturition, lactation, 
weaning,

[[Page 99]]

and the growth and development of the offspring. The study may also 
provide information about the effects of the test substance on neonatal 
morbidity, mortality, and preliminary data on prenatal developmental 
toxicity and serve as a guide for subsequent tests.
    (5) Mutagenicity studies. For each test substance a battery of tests 
is required to assess the potential to affect the mammalian cell's 
genetic components. The objectives underlying the selection of a battery 
of tests for mutagenicity assessment are:
    (i) To detect, with sensitive assay methods, the capacity of a 
chemical to alter genetic material in cells.
    (ii) To determine the relevance of these mutagenic changes to 
mammals.
    (iii) When mutagenic potential is demonstrated, to incorporate these 
findings in the assessment of heritable effects, carcinogenicity, and, 
possibly, other health effects.
    (6) Metabolism studies. Data from studies on the absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, and excretion of a pesticide aid in the 
valuation of test results from other toxicity studies and in the 
extrapolation of data from animals to man. The main purpose of 
metabolism studies is to produce data which increases the Agency's 
understanding of the behavior of the chemical when considering the human 
exposure anticipated from intended uses of the pesticide.
    (e) Hazards to nontarget organisms--(1) General. The information 
required to assess hazards to nontarget organisms is derived from tests 
to determine pesticidal effects on birds, mammals, fish, terrestrial and 
aquatic invertebrates and plants. These tests include short-term acute, 
subacute, reproduction, simulated field, and full field studies arranged 
in a hierarchical or tier system which progresses from the basic 
laboratory tests to the applied field tests. The results of each tier of 
testing must be evaluated to determine the potential of the pesticide to 
cause adverse effects, and to determine whether further testing is 
required. A purpose common to all data requirements is to provide data 
which determine the need for (and appropriate wording for) precautionary 
label statements to minimize the potential adverse effects to nontarget 
organisms.
    (2) Short-term studies. The short-term acute and subchronic 
laboratory studies provide basic toxicity information which serves as a 
starting point for the hazard assessment. These data are used: To 
establish acute toxicity levels of the active ingredient to the test 
organisms; to compare toxicity information with measured or estimated 
pesticide residues in the environment in order to assess potential 
impacts on fish, wildlife and other nontarget organisms; and to indicate 
whether further laboratory and/or field studies are needed.
    (3) Long-term and field studies. Additional studies (i.e., avian, 
fish, and invertebrate reproduction, life cycle studies and plant field 
studies) may be required when basic data and environmental conditions 
suggest possible problems. Data from these studies are used to: Estimate 
the potential for chronic effects, taking into account the measured or 
estimated residues in the environment; and to determine if additional 
field or laboratory data are necessary to further evaluate hazards. 
Simulated field and/or field data are used to examine acute and chronic 
adverse effects on captive or monitored fish and wildlife populations 
under natural or near-natural environments. Such studies are required 
only when predictions as to possible adverse effects in less extensive 
studies cannot be made, or when the potential for adverse effects is 
high.
    (f) Applicator and post-application exposure. Data are used to 
evaluate exposures to persons in occupational and non-occupational 
settings, including agricultural, residential, commercial, institutional 
and recreational sites. Data include oral, dermal and inhalation 
exposure data, post-application residue data, post-application 
monitoring data, use information, and human activity information. These 
data, together with toxicology data, are used to determine whether 
application or post-application risks are of concern, and, where 
appropriate, to develop post-application restrictions such as reentry 
restrictions.
    (g) Pesticide spray drift evaluation. Data required to evaluate 
pesticide

[[Page 100]]

spray drift are derived from studies of droplet size spectrum and spray 
drift field evaluations. These data contribute to the development of the 
overall exposure estimate and, along with data on toxicity for humans, 
fish and wildlife, or plants, are used to assess the potential hazard of 
pesticides to these organisms. A purpose common to all these tests is to 
provide data which will be used to determine the need for (and 
appropriate wording for) precautionary labeling to minimize the 
potential adverse effect to nontarget organisms.
    (h) Environmental fate--(1) General. The data generated by 
environmental fate studies are used to: Assess the toxicity to man 
through exposure of humans to pesticide residues remaining after 
application, either upon reentering treated areas or from consuming 
inadvertantly-contaminated food; assess the presence of widely 
distributed and persistent pesticides in the environment which may 
result in loss of usable land, surface water, ground water, and wildlife 
resources; and, assess the potential environmental exposure of other 
nontarget organisms, such as fish and wildlife, to pesticides. Another 
specific purpose of the environmental fate data requirements is to help 
applicants and the Agency estimate expected environmental concentrations 
of pesticides in specific habitats where threatened or endangered 
species or other wildlife populations at risk are found.
    (2) Degradation studies. The data from hydrolysis and photolysis 
studies are used to determine the rate of pesticide degradation and to 
identify pesticides that may adversely affect nontarget organisms.
    (3) Metabolism studies. Data generated from aerobic and anaerobic 
metabolism studies are used to determine the nature and availability of 
pesticides to rotational crops and to aid in the evaluation of the 
persistence of a pesticide.
    (4) Mobility studies. These data requirements pertain to leaching, 
adsorption/desorption, and volatility of pesticides. They provide 
information on the mode of transport and eventual destination of the 
pesticide in the environment. This information is used to assess 
potential environmental hazards related to: Contamination of human and 
animal food; loss of usable land and water resources to man through 
contamination of water (including ground water); and habitat loss of 
wildlife resulting from pesticide residue movement or transport in the 
environment.
    (5) Dissipation studies. The data generated from dissipation studies 
are used to assess potential environmental hazards (under actual field 
use conditions) related to: Reentry into treated areas; hazards from 
residues in rotational crops and other food sources; and the loss of 
land as well as surface and ground water resources.
    (i) Residue chemistry. (1) Residue chemistry data are used by the 
Agency to estimate the exposure of the general population to pesticide 
residues in food and for setting and enforcing tolerances for pesticide 
residues in food or feed.
    (2) Information on the chemical identity and composition of the 
pesticide product, the amounts, frequency and time of the pesticide 
application, and results of tests on the amount of residues remaining on 
or in the treated food or feed, are needed to support a finding as to 
the magnitude and identity of residues which result in food or animal 
feed as a consequence of a proposed pesticide usage.
    (3) Residue chemistry data are also needed to support the adequacy 
of one or more methods for the enforcement of the tolerance, and to 
support practicable methods for removing residues that exceed any 
proposed tolerance.
    (4) Accumulation studies. Accumulation studies indicate pesticide 
residue levels in food supplies that originate from wild sources or from 
rotational crops. Rotational crop studies are necessary to establish 
realistic crop rotation restrictions and to determine if tolerances may 
be needed for residues on rotational crops. Data from irrigated crop 
studies are used to determine the amount of pesticide residues that 
could be taken up by representative crops irrigated with water 
containing pesticide residues. These studies allow the Agency to 
establish label restrictions regarding application of pesticides on 
sites where the residues can be taken up by irrigated crops.

[[Page 101]]

These data also provide information that aids the Agency in establishing 
any corresponding tolerances that would be needed for residues on such 
crops. Data from pesticide accumulation studies in fish are used to 
establish label restrictions to prevent applications in certain sites so 
that there will be minimal residues entering edible fish or shellfish. 
These residue data are also used to determine if a tolerance or action 
level is needed for residues in aquatic animals eaten by humans.

    (d) Test notes. The following test notes apply to the data 
requirements in the table to paragraph (c) of this section.
    1. The Agency has waived the requirement to submit efficacy data 
unless the pesticide product bears a claim to control pest 
microorganisms that pose a threat to human health and whose presence 
cannot readily be observed by the user including, but not limited to, 
microorganisms infectious to man in any area of the inanimate 
environment, or a claim to control vertebrates (such as rodents, birds, 
bats, canids, and skunks) that may directly or indirectly transmit 
diseases to humans. However each registrant must ensure through testing 
that his product is efficacious when used in accordance with label 
directions and commonly accepted pest control practices. The Agency 
reserves the right to require, on a case-by-case basis, submission of 
efficacy data for any pesticide product registered or proposed for 
registration.
    2. [Reserved]

less than 2 or greater than 11.5.
    3. Required if the product consists of, or under conditions of use 
will result in, a respirable material (e.g., gas, vapor, aerosol, or 
particulate).
    4. Required if repeated dermal exposure is likely to occur under 
conditions of use.
    5. Required if the test material is an organophosphorus substance, 
which includes uncharged organophosphorus esters, thioesters, or 
anhydrides of organophosphoric, organophosphonic, or 
organophosphoramidic acids, or of related phosphorothioic, 
phosponothioic, or phosphorothioamidic acids, or is structurally related 
to other substances that may cause the delayed neurotoxicity sometimes 
seen in this class of chemicals.
    6. These studies are seldom required to support EUPs. They may be 
required if the dietary exposure for these EUPs occupies a large part, 
e.g., greater than 50%, of the reference dose.
    7. The oral route, by oral intubation, is preferred unless the 
chemical or physical properties of the test substance or the pattern of 
exposure suggests a more appropriate route of exposure.
    8. May be combined with the 2-generation reproduction study in 
rodents by utilizing a second mating of the parental animals in either 
generation.
    9. At a minimum, an initial battery of mutagenicity tests with 
possible confirmatory testing is required. Other relevant mutagenicity 
tests that may have been performed, plus a complete reference list must 
also be submitted.
    10. Choice of assay using either:
    i. Mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells, thymidine kinase (tk) gene locus, 
maximizing assay conditions for small colony expression or detection;
    ii. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or Chinese hamster lung fibroblast 
(V79) cells, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hgprt) 
gene locus, accompanied by an appropriate in vitro test for 
clastogenicity; or
    iii. CHO cells strains AS52, xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl 
transferase (xprt) gene locus.
    11. The micronucleus rodent bone marrow assay is preferred; however, 
rodent bone marrow assays using metaphase analysis (aberrations) are 
acceptable.

    (d) Test notes. The following test notes apply to the data 
requirements in the table to paragraph (c) of this section.
    1. Data using the TGAI are required to support all outdoor end-use 
product uses including, but not limited to, turf. Data are generally not 
required to support end-use products in the form of a gas, a highly 
volatile

[[Page 106]]

liquid, a highly reactive solid, or a highly corrosive material.
    2. For greenhouse and indoor end-use products, data using the TGAI 
are required to support manufacturing-use products to be reformulated 
into these same end-use products or to support end-use products when 
there is no registered manufacturing-use product. Avian acute oral data 
are not required for liquid formulations for greenhouse and indoor uses. 
The study is not required if there is no potential for environmental 
exposure.
    3. Data are required on one passerine species and either one 
waterfowl species or one upland game bird species for terrestrial, 
aquatic, forestry, and residential outdoor uses. Data are preferred on 
waterfowl or upland game bird species for indoor and greenhouse uses.
    4. Data are required on waterfowl and upland game bird species.
    5. Data are required on one coldwater fish and one warmwater fish 
for terrestrial, aquatic, forestry, and residential outdoor uses. For 
indoor and greenhouse uses, testing with only one of either fish species 
is required.
    6. EP or TEP testing is required for any product which meets any of 
the following conditions:
    i. The end-use pesticide will be introduced directly into an aquatic 
environment (e.g., aquatic herbicides and mosquito larvicides) when used 
as directed.
    ii. The maximum expected environmental concentration (MEEC) or the 
estimated environmental concentration (EEC) in the aquatic environment 
is >= one-half the LC<INF>50</INF> or EC<INF>50</INF> of the TGAI when 
the EP is used as directed.
    iii. An ingredient in the end-use formulation other than the active 
ingredient is expected to enhance the toxicity of the active ingredient 
or to cause toxicity to aquatic organisms.
    7. Data are required on one freshwater aquatic invertebrate species.
    8. Data are generally not required for outdoor residential uses, 
other than turf, unless data indicate that pesticide residues from the 
proposed use(s) can potentially enter waterways.
    9. Data are required on one freshwater fish species. If the test 
species is different from the two species used for the freshwater fish 
acute toxicity tests, a 96 hour LC<INF>50</INF> on that species must 
also be provided.
    10. Not required when:
    i. The octanol/water partition coefficients of the pesticide and its 
major degradates are < 1,000; or
    ii. There are no potential exposures to fish and other nontarget 
aquatic organisms; or
    iii. The hydrolytic half-life is < 5 days at pH 5, 7 and 9.
    11. The freshwater fish test species for the TEP testing is the most 
sensitive of the species tested with the TGAI. A freshwater invertebrate 
must also be tested with the EP or TEP using the same species tested 
with the TGAI.

    (d) Test notes. The following test notes apply to the data 
requirements in the table to paragraph (c) of this section.
    1. Study is required for indoor uses in cases where environmental 
exposure is likely to occur. Such sites include, but are not limited to, 
agricultural premises, in or around farm buildings, barnyards, and 
beehives.
    2. Required for aquatic uses for aquatic sites that are 
intermittently dry. Such sites include, but are not limited to cranberry 
bogs and rice paddies.
    3. Adsorption and desorption using a batch equilibrium method is 
preferred. However, in some cases, for example, where the pesticide 
degrades rapidly, soil column leaching with unaged or aged columns may 
be more appropriate to fully characterize the potential mobility of the 
parent compound and major transformation products.

                       Subpart D_Product Chemistry


<R05>
Sec. 158.300  Definitions.

    The following terms are defined for the purposes of this subpart:
    Active ingredient means any substance (or group of structurally 
similar substances, if specified by the Agency) that will prevent, 
destroy, repel or mitigate any pest, or that functions as a plant 
regulator, desiccant, defoliant, or nitrogen stabilizer, within the 
meaning of FIFRA sec. 2(b).
    End-use product means a pesticide product whose labeling:
    (1) Includes directions for use of the product (as distributed or 
sold, or after combination by the user with other substances) for 
controlling pests or defoliating, desiccating or regulating growth of 
plants, or as a nitrogen stabilizer, and
    (2) does not state that the product may be used to manufacture or 
formulate other pesticide products.
    Formulation means:
    (1) The process of mixing, blending, or dilution of one or more 
active ingredients with one or more other active or inert ingredients, 
without an intended

[[Page 108]]

chemical reaction, to obtain a manufacturing-use product or an end-use 
product, or
    (2) The repackaging of any registered product.
    Impurity means any substance (or group of structurally similar 
substances if specified by the Agency), in a pesticide product other 
than an active ingredient or an inert ingredient, including unreacted 
starting materials, side reaction products, contaminants, and 
degradation products.
    Impurity associated with an active ingredient means:
    (1) Any impurity present in the technical grade of active 
ingredient; and
    (2) Any impurity which forms in the pesticide product through 
reactions between the active ingredient and any other component of the 
product or packaging of the product.
    Inert ingredient means any substance (or group of structurally 
similar substances if designated by the Agency), other than the active 
ingredient, which is intentionally included in a pesticide product.
    Integrated system means a process for producing a pesticide product 
that:
    (1) Contains any active ingredient derived from a source that is not 
an EPA-registered product; or
    (2) Contains any active ingredient that was produced or acquired in 
a manner that does not permit its inspection by the Agency under FIFRA 
sec. 9(a) prior to its use in the process.
    Manufacturing-use product means any pesticide product other than an 
end-use product. A product may consist of the technical grade of active 
ingredient only, or may contain inert ingredients, such as stabilizers 
or solvents.
    Nominal concentration means the amount of an ingredient which is 
expected to be present in a typical sample of a pesticide product at the 
time the product is produced, expressed as a percentage by weight.
    Starting material means a substance used to synthesize or purify a 
technical grade of active ingredient (or the practical equivalent of the 
technical grade ingredient if the technical grade cannot be isolated) by 
chemical reaction.
    Technical grade of active ingredient means a material containing an 
active ingredient:
    (1) Which contains no inert ingredient, other than one used for 
purification of the active ingredient; and
    (2) Which is produced on a commercial or pilot plant production 
scale (whether or not it is ever held for sale).

Sec. 158.310  Product chemistry data requirements table.

    (a) General. Sections 158.100 through 158.130 describe how to use 
this table to determine the product chemistry data requirements for a 
particular pesticide product. Notes that apply to an individual test and 
include specific conditions, qualifications, or exceptions to the 
designated test are listed in paragraph (f) of the section.
    (b) Use patterns. Product chemistry data are required for all 
pesticide products and are not use-specific.
    (c) Test substance. Data requirements that list only the 
manufacturing-use product as the test substance apply to products 
containing solely the technical grade of the active ingredient and 
manufacturing-use products to which other ingredients have been 
intentionally added.
    (d) Key. R=Required; CR=Conditionally required; MP=Manufacturing-use 
product; NR=Not required; EP=End-use product; TGAI=Technical grade of 
the active ingredient; PAI=Pure active ingredient.

level >=0.1 percent (1,000 ppm) by weight of the technical grade of the 
active ingredient, based on what he knows about the following:
    (i) The composition (or composition range) of each starting material 
used to produce his product.
    (ii) The impurities which the applicant knows are present (or 
believes are likely to be present) in the starting materials, and the 
known or presumed level (or range of levels) of these impurities.
    (iii) The intended reactions and side reactions which may occur in 
the production of the product, and the relative amounts of byproduct 
impurities produced by such reactions.
    (iv) The possible degradation of the ingredients in the product 
after its production but prior to its use.
    (v) Post-production reactions between the ingredients in the 
product.
    (vi) The possible migration of components of packaging materials 
into the pesticide.
    (vii) The possible carryover of contaminants from use of production 
equipment previously used to produce other products or substances.
    (viii) The process control, purification and quality control 
measures used to produce the product.
    (b) Products not produced by an integrated system. Each impurity 
associated with the active ingredient which the applicant has reason to 
believe may be present in the product at any time before use at a level 
>=0.1 percent (1,000 ppm) by weight of the product based on what he 
knows about the following:
    (1) The possible carryover of impurities present in any registered 
product which serves as the source of any of the product's active 
ingredients. The identity and level of impurities in the registered 
source need not be discussed or quantified unless known to the 
formulator.
    (2) The possible carryover of impurities present in the inert 
ingredients in the product.
    (3) Possible reactions occurring during the formulation of the 
product between any of its active ingredients, between the active 
ingredients and inert ingredients, or between the active ingredient and 
the production equipment.
    (4) Post-production reactions between any of the product's active 
ingredients and any other component of the product or its packaging.
    (5) Possible migration of packaging materials into the product.
    (6) Possible contaminants resulting from earlier use of equipment to 
produce other products.
    (c) Expanded discussion. On a case-by-case basis, the Agency may 
require an expanded discussion of information on impurities:
    (1) From other possible chemical reactions.
    (2) Involving other ingredients.
    (3) At additional points in the production or formulation process.


<R05>
Sec. 158.345  Preliminary analysis.

    (a) If the product is produced by an integrated system, the 
applicant must provide a preliminary analysis of each technical grade of 
active ingredient contained in the product to identify all impurities 
present at 0. 1 percent or greater of the technical grade of the active 
ingredient. The preliminary analysis should be conducted at the point in 
the production process after which no further chemical reactions 
designed to produce or purify the substances are intended.
    (b) Based on the preliminary analysis, a statement of the 
composition of the technical grade of the active ingredient must be 
provided. If the technical grade of the active ingredient cannot

[[Page 114]]

be isolated, a statement of the composition of the practical equivalent 
of the technical grade of the active ingredient must be submitted.


<R05>
Sec. 158.350  Certified limits.

    The applicant must propose certified limits for the ingredients in 
the product. Certified limits become legally binding limits upon 
approval of the application. Certified limits will apply to the product 
from the date of production to date of use. If the product label bears a 
statement prohibiting use after a certain date, the certified limits 
will apply only until that date.
    (a) Ingredients for which certified limits are required. Certified 
limits are required on the following ingredients of a pesticide product:
    (1) An upper and lower limit for each active ingredient.
    (2) An upper and lower limit for each inert ingredient.
    (3) If the product is a technical grade of active ingredient or is 
produced by an integrated system, an upper limit for each impurity of 
toxicological significance associated with the active ingredient and 
found to be present in any sample of the product.
    (4) On a case-by-case basis, certified limits for other ingredients 
or impurities as specified by EPA.
    (b) EPA determination of standard certified limits for active and 
inert ingredients. (1) Unless the applicant proposes different limits as 
provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the upper and lower certified 
limits for active and inert ingredients will be determined by EPA. EPA 
will calculate the certified limits on the basis of the nominal 
concentration of the ingredient in the product, according to the table 
in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (2) Table of standard certified limits.

                        Standard Certified Limits
------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the nominal concentration (N)       The certified limits for that
     for the ingredient and           ingredient will be as follows:
  percentage by weight for the   ---------------------------------------
         ingredient is:               Upper Limit         Lower Limit
------------------------------------------------------------------------
N <=1.0%........................  N + 10%N            N - 10%N
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0% <=N <=20.0%................  N + 5%N             N - 5%N
------------------------------------------------------------------------
20.0%<=N<=100.0%................  N + 3%N             N - 3%N
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Applicant proposed limits. (1) The applicant may propose a 
certified limit for an active or inert ingredient that differs from the 
standard certified limit calculated according to paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section.
    (2) If certified limits are required for impurities, the applicants 
must propose a certified limit. The standard certified limits may not be 
used for such substances.
    (3) Certified limits should:
    (i) Be based on a consideration of the variability of the 
concentration of the ingredient in the product when good manufacturing 
practices and normal quality control procedures are used.
    (ii) Allow for all sources of variability likely to be encountered 
in the production process.
    (iii) Take into account the stability of the ingredient in the 
product and the possible formation of impurities between production and 
sale or distribution.
    (4) The applicant may include an explanation of the basis of his 
proposed certified limits, including how the certified limits were 
arrived at (e.g., sample analysis, quantitative estimate based on 
production process), and its accuracy and precision. This will be 
particularly useful if the range of the certified limit for an active or 
inert ingredient is greater than the standard certified limits.
    (d) Special cases. If the Agency finds unacceptable any certified 
limit (either standard, or applicant proposed), the Agency will inform 
the registrant or applicant of its determination and will provide 
supporting reasons. The Agency may also recommend alternative limits to 
the applicant. The Agency may require, on a case-by-case basis, any or 
all of the following:
    (1) More precise limits.

[[Page 115]]

    (2) More thorough explanation of how the certified limits were 
determined.
    (3) A narrower range between the upper and lower certified limits 
than that proposed.
    (e) Certification statement. The applicant must certify the accuracy 
of the information presented, and that the certified limits of the 
ingredients will be maintained. The following statement, signed by the 
authorized representative of the company, is acceptable:
    I hereby certify that, for purposes of FIFRA sec. 12(a)(1)(C), the 
description of the composition of [insert product name], EPA Reg. No. 
[insert registration number], refers to the composition set forth on the 
Statement of Formula and supporting materials. This description includes 
the representations that: (1) no ingredient will be present in the 
product in an amount greater than the upper certified limit or in an 
amount less than the lower certified limit (if required) specified for 
that ingredient in a currently approved Statement of Formula (or as 
calculated by the Agency); and (2) if the Agency requires that the 
source of supply of an ingredient be specified, that all quantities of 
such ingredient will be obtained from the source specified in the 
Statement of Formula.


<R05>
Sec. 158.355  Enforcement analytical method.

    An analytical method suitable for enforcement purposes must be 
provided for each active ingredient in the product and for each other 
ingredient or impurity that the Agency determines to be toxicologically 
significant.

    (e) Test notes. The following notes appy to the data requirements 
table in paragraph (d) of this section.
    1. The Agency has waived the requirement to submit product 
performance data unless the pesticide product bears a claim to control 
pest microorganisms that pose a threat to human health and whose 
presence cannot readily be observed by the user including, but not 
limited to, microorganisms infectious to man in any area of the 
inanimate environment, or a claim to control vertebrates (such as 
rodents, birds, bats, canids, and skunks) that may directly or 
indirectly transmit diseases to humans. However each registrant must 
ensure through testing that his product is efficacious when used in 
accordance with label directions and commonly accepted pest control 
practices. The Agency reserves the right to require, on a case-by-case 
basis, submission of product performance data for any pesticide product 
registered or proposed for registration.

    (e) Test notes. The following test notes apply to the requirements 
in the table to paragraph (d) of this section:
    1. Not required if test material is a gas or a highly volatile 
liquid.
    2. Diluted EP testing is required to support the end product 
registration if results using the EP meet the criteria for restricted 
use classification under Sec. 152.170(b) or special review 
consideration under Sec. 154.7(a)(1).
    3. Not required if the test material is corrosive to skin or has a 
pH of less than 2 or greater than 11.5.
    4. Required if the product consists of, or under conditions of use 
will result in, a respirable material (e.g., gas, vapor, aerosol, or 
particulate).

[[Page 120]]

    5. Required if repeated dermal exposure is likely to occur under 
conditions of use.
    6. Required if the test material is an organophosphorus substance, 
which includes uncharged organophosphorus esters; thioesters or 
anhydrides of organophosphoric, organophosphonic, or 
organophosphoramidic acids; or of related phosphorothioic, 
phosponothioic, or phosphorothioamidic acids; or is structurally related 
to other substances that may cause the delayed neurotoxicity sometimes 
seen in this class of chemicals.
    7. As determined by the Agency, additional measurements may also be 
required, such as cholinesterase activity for certain pesticides, e.g., 
organophosphates and some carbamates. The route of exposure must 
correspond with the primary route of exposure.
    8. Required for nonfood use pesticides if oral exposure could occur.
    9. The 90-day study is required in the rat for hazard 
characterization (possibly endpoint selection) and dose-setting for the 
chronic/carcinogenicity study. It is not required in the mouse, but the 
Agency would strongly encourage the registrant to conduct a 90-day range 
finding for the purposes of dose selection for the mouse carcinogenicity 
study to achieve adequate dosing and an acceptable study. The registrant 
is also encouraged to consult with the Agency on the results of the 90-
day mouse study prior to conducting the carcinogenicity study.
    10. Required for agricultural uses or if repeated human dermal 
exposure may occur. Not required if an acceptable 90-day dermal toxicity 
study is performed and submitted.
    11. EP testing is required if the product, or any component of it, 
may increase dermal absorption of the active ingredient(s) as determined 
by testing using the TGAI, or increase toxic or pharmacologic effects.
    12. Required for food uses if either of the following criteria is 
met:
    (i) The use pattern is such that the dermal route would be the 
primary route of exposure; or
    (ii) The active ingredient is known or expected to be metabolized 
differently by the dermal route of exposure than by the oral route, and 
a metabolite is the toxic moiety.
    13. Required if there is the likelihood of significant repeated 
inhalation exposure to the pesticide as a gas, vapor, or aerosol.
    14. Based on estimates of the magnitude and duration of human 
exposure, studies of shorter duration, e.g., 21- or 28-days, may be 
sufficient to satisfy this requirement. Registrants should consult with 
the Agency to determine whether studies of shorter duration would meet 
this requirement.
    15. Required if results of acute neurotoxicity study indicate 
significant statistical or biological effects, or if other available 
data indicate the potential for this type of delayed neurotoxicity, as 
determined by the Agency.
    16. All 90-day subchronic studies in rats can be designed to 
simultaneously fulfill the requirements of the 90-day neurotoxicity 
study using separate groups of animals for testing. Although the 
subchronic guidelines include the measurement of neurological endpoints, 
they do not meet the requirement of the 90-day neurotoxicity study.
    17. Required if either of the following are met:
    (i) The use of the pesticide is likely to result in repeated human 
exposure over a considerable portion of the human lifespan, as 
determined by the Agency;
    (ii) The use requires a tolerance or an exemption from the 
requirement of a tolerance.
    18. Based on the results of the acute and subchronic neurotoxicity 
studies, or other available data, a combined chronic toxicity and 
neurotoxicity study may be required.
    19. Studies which are designed to simultaneously fulfill the 
requirements of both the chronic oral and carcinogenicity studies (i.e., 
a combined study) may be conducted. Minimum acceptable study durations 
are:
    (i) Chronic rodent feeding study (food use) - 24 months.
    (ii) Chronic rodent feeding study (nonfood use) - 12 months.
    (iii) Mouse carcinogenicity study - 18 months.
    (iv) Rat carcinogenicity study - 24 months.
    20. Required if any of the following, as determined by the Agency, 
are met:
    (i) The use of the pesticide is likely to result in significant 
human exposure over a considerable portion of the human life span which 
is significant in terms of either frequency, duration, or magnitude of 
exposure;
    (ii) The use requires a tolerance or an exemption from the 
requirement of a tolerance; or
    (iii) The active ingredient, metabolite, degradate, or impurity (a) 
is structurally related to a recognized carcinogen, (b) causes mutagenic 
effects as demonstrated by in vitro or in vivo testing, or (c) produces 
a morphologic effect in any organ (e.g., hyperplasia, metaplasia) in 
subchronic studies that may lead to a neoplastic change.
    21. If this study is modified or waived, a subchronic 90-day oral 
study conducted in the same species may be required.
    22. Testing in two species is required for all uses.
    23. The oral route, by oral intubation, is preferred unless the 
chemical or physical properties of the test substance or the pattern of 
exposure suggests a more appropriate route of exposure.
    24. Additional testing by other routes may be required if the 
pesticide is determined to be a prenatal developmental toxicant after 
oral dosing.

[[Page 121]]

    25. May be combined with the 2-generation reproduction study in 
rodents by utilizing a second mating of the parental animals in either 
generation.
    26. Required to support products intended for food uses and to 
support products intended for nonfood uses if use of the product is 
likely to result in significant human exposure over a portion of the 
human life span in terms of frequency, magnitude or duration of 
exposure.
    27. An information-based approach to testing is preferred, which 
utilizes the best available knowledge on the chemical (hazard, 
pharmacokinetic, or mechanistic data) to determine whether a standard 
guideline study, an enhanced guideline study, or an alternative study 
should be conducted to assess potential hazard to the developing animal, 
or in some cases to support a waiver for such testing. Registrants 
should submit any alternative proposed testing protocols and supporting 
scientific rationale to the Agency prior to study initiation.
    28. Study required using a weight-of-evidence approach considering:
    (i) The pesticide causes treatment-related neurological effects in 
adult animal studies (i.e., clinical signs of neurotoxicity, 
neuropathology, functional or behavioral effects).
    (ii) The pesticide causes treatment-related neurological effects in 
developing animals, following pre- and postnatal exposure (i.e., nervous 
system malformations or neuropathy, brain weight changes in offspring, 
functional or behavioral changes in the offspring).
    (iii) The pesticide elicits a causative association between 
exposures and adverse neurological effects in human epidemiological 
studies.
    (iv) The pesticide evokes a mechanism that is associated with 
adverse effects on the development of the nervous system (e.g., SAR 
relationship to known neurotoxicants, altered neuroreceptor or 
neurotransmitter responses).
    29. The use of a combined study that utilizes the 2-generation 
reproduction study in rodents as a basic protocol for the addition of 
other endpoints or functional assessments in the immature animal is 
encouraged.
    30. At a minimum, an initial battery of mutagenicity tests with 
possible confirmatory testing is required. Other relevant mutagenicity 
tests that may have been performed, plus a complete reference list must 
also be submitted.
    31. Choice of assay using either:
    (i) Mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells, thymidine kinase (tk) gene locus, 
maximizing assay conditions for small colony expression or detection;
    (ii) Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or Chinese hamster lung fibroblast 
(V79) cells, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hgprt) 
gene locus, accompanied by an appropriate in vitro test for 
clastogenicity; or
    (iii) CHO cells strains AS52, xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl 
transferase (xprt) gene locus.
    32. The micronucleus rodent bone marrow assay is preferred; however, 
rodent bone marrow assays using metaphase analysis (aberrations) are 
acceptable.
    33. Required when chronic or carcinogenicity studies are required. 
May be required if significant adverse effects are seen in available 
toxicology studies and these effects can be further elucidated by 
metabolism studies.
    34. May be required if the product's use will result in exposure to 
domestic animals through, but not limited to, direct application.
    35. A risk assessment assuming that dermal absorption is equal to 
oral absorption must be performed to determine if the study is required, 
and to identify the doses and duration of exposure for which dermal 
absorption is to be quantified.
    36. A 1-year non-rodent study (i.e., 1-year dog study) would be 
required if the Agency finds that a pesticide chemical is highly 
bioaccumulating and is eliminated so slowly that it does not achieve 
steady state or sufficient tissue concentrations to elicit an effect 
during a 90-day study. EPA would require the appropriate tier II 
metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies to evaluate more precisely 
bioavailability, half-life, and steady state to determine if a longer 
duration dog toxicity study is needed.

Sec. 158.510  Tiered testing options for nonfood pesticides.

    For nonfood use pesticides only, applicants have two options for 
generating and submitting required toxicology (Sec. 158.500) and human 
exposure (Sec. 158.1020, Sec. 158.1070, and Sec. 158.1410) studies. 
Applicants are to select one of the following:
    (a) Acute, subchronic, chronic, and other toxicological studies on 
the active ingredient must be submitted together. The specific makeup of 
the set of toxicology study requirements is based on the anticipated 
exposure to the pesticide as determined by the Agency. If hazards are 
identified based upon review of these studies, specific exposure data 
will be required to evaluate risk.
    (b) Certain toxicological and exposure studies must be submitted 
simultaneously with the toxicology data submitted in a tiered system. 
Exposure data must be submitted along with

[[Page 122]]

first tier toxicology data. The requirement for additional second and 
third level toxicology testing will be determined by the Agency based on 
the results of the first tiered studies.
    (1) The required first-tier toxicology studies consist of:
    (i) Battery of acute studies.
    (ii) A subchronic 90-day dermal study or a subchronic 90-day 
inhalation study.
    (iii) An acute and subchronic neurotoxicity screening battery in the 
rat.

Sec. 158.630  Terrestrial and aquatic nontarget organisms data requirements table.

    (a) General. Sections 158.100 through 158.130 describe how to use 
this table to determine the terrestrial and aquatic nontarget data 
requirements for a particular pesticide product. Notes that apply to an 
individual test including specific conditions, qualifications, or 
exceptions to the designated test are listed in paragraph (e) of this 
section.
    (b) Use patterns. (1) The terrestrial use pattern includes products 
classified under the general use patterns of terrestrial food crop, 
terrestrial feed crop, and terrestrial nonfood crop. The aquatic use 
pattern includes products classified under the general use patterns of 
aquatic food crop and aquatic nonfood use patterns. The greenhouse use 
pattern includes products classified under the general use patterns of 
greenhouse food crop and greenhouse nonfood crop. The indoor use pattern 
includes products classified under the general use patterns of indoor 
food and indoor nonfood use.
    (2) Data are also required for the general use patterns of forestry 
and residential outdoor use.
    (3) In general, for all outdoor end-uses, including turf, the 
following studies are required: Two avian oral LD<INF>50</INF>, two 
avian dietary LC<INF>50</INF>, two avian reproduction studies, two 
freshwater fish LC<INF>50</INF>, one freshwater invertebrate 
EC<INF>50</INF>, one honeybee acute contact LD<INF>50</INF>, one 
freshwater fish early-life stage, one freshwater invertebrate life 
cycle, and three estuarine acute LC<INF>50</INF>/EC<INF>50</INF> studies 
-- fish, mollusk and invertebrate. All other outdoor residential uses, 
i.e., gardens and ornamental will not usually require the freshwater 
fish early-life stage, the freshwater invertebrate life-cycle, and the 
acute estuarine tests.
    (c) Key. R=Required; CR=Conditionally required; NR=Not required; 
TGAI=Technical grade of the active ingredient; TEP=Typical end-use 
product; PAI=Pure active ingredient; EP=end-use product. Commas between 
the test substances (i.e., TGAI, TEP) indicate that data may be required 
on the TGAI or the TEP depending on the conditions set forth in the test 
note.
    (d) Table. The following table shows the data requirements for 
nontarget terrestrial and aquatic organism. The table notes are shown in 
paragraph (e) of this section.

    (e) Test notes. The following test notes apply to terrestrial and 
aquatic nontarget organisms data requirements in the table to paragraph 
(d) of this section:
    1. Data using the TGAI are required to support all outdoor end-use 
product uses including, but not limited to turf. Data are generally not 
required to support end-use products in the form of a gas, a highly 
volatile liquid, a highly reactive solid, or a highly corrosive 
material.
    2. For greenhouse and indoor end-use products, data using the TGAI 
are required to support manufacturing-use products to be reformulated 
into these same end-use products or to support end-use products when 
there is no registered manufacturing-use product. Avian acute oral data 
are not required for liquid formulations for greenhouse and indoor uses. 
The study is not required if there is no potential for environmental 
exposure.
    3. Data are required on one passerine species and either one 
waterfowl species or one upland game bird species for terrestrial, 
aquatic, forestry, and residential outdoor uses. Data are preferred on 
waterfowl or upland game bird species for indoor and greenhouse uses.
    4. Data are required on waterfowl and upland game bird species.
    5. Tests are required based on the results of lower tier toxicology 
studies, such as the acute and subacute testing, intended use pattern, 
and environmental fate characteristics that indicate potential exposure.
    6. Higher tier testing may be required for a specific use pattern 
when a refined risk assessment indicates a concern based on laboratory 
toxicity endpoints and refined exposure assessments.
    7. Environmental chemistry methods used to generate data associated 
with this study must include results of a successful confirmatory method 
trial by an independent laboratory. Test standards and procedures for 
independent laboratory validation are available as addenda to the 
guideline for this test requirement.
    8. Data are required on one coldwater fish and one warmwater fish 
for terrestrial, aquatic, forestry, and residential outdoor uses. For 
indoor and greenhouse uses, testing with only one of either fish species 
is required.
    9. EP or TEP testing is required for any product which meets any of 
the following conditions:
    i. The end-use pesticide will be introduced directly into an aquatic 
environment (e.g., aquatic herbicides and mosquito larvicides) when used 
as directed.
    ii. The maximum expected environmental concentration (MEEC) or the 
estimated environmental concentration (EEC) in the aquatic environment 
is >= one-half the LC<INF>50</INF> or EC<INF>50</INF> of the TGAI when 
the EP is used as directed.
    iii. An ingredient in the end-use formulation other than the active 
ingredient is expected to enhance the toxicity of the active ingredient 
or to cause toxicity to aquatic organisms.
    10. Data are required on one freshwater aquatic invertebrate 
species.
    11. Data are required on one estuarine/marine mollusk, one 
estuarine/marine invertebrate and one estuarine/marine fish species.
    12. Data are generally not required for outdoor residential uses, 
other than turf, unless data indicate that pesticide residues from the 
proposed use(s) can potentially enter waterways.

[[Page 125]]

    13. Data are required on one freshwater fish species. If the test 
species is different from the two species used for the freshwater fish 
acute toxicity tests, a 96-hour LC<INF>50</INF> on that species must 
also be provided.
    14. Data are required on one estuarine/marine invertebrate species.
    15. Data are required on estuarine/marine species if the product 
meets any of the following conditions:
    i. Intended for direct application to the estuarine or marine 
environment.
    ii. Expected to enter this environment in significant concentrations 
because of its expected use or mobility patterns.
    iii. If the acute LC<INF>50</INF> or EC<INF>50</INF> < 1 milligram/
liter (mg/l).
    iv. If the estimated environmental concentration (EEC) in water is 
>= 0.01 of the acute EC<INF>50</INF> or LC<INF>50</INF> or if any of the 
following conditions exist:
    A. Studies of other organisms indicate the reproductive physiology 
of fish and/or invertebrates may be affected.
    B. Physicochemical properties indicate bioaccumulation of the 
pesticide.
    C. The pesticide is persistent in water (e.g., half-life in water > 
4 days).
    16. Data are required on one estuarine/marine fish species.
    17. Data are required on estuarine/marine species if the product is 
intended for direct application to the estuarine or marine environment, 
or the product is expected to enter this environment in significant 
concentrations because of its expected use or mobility patterns.
    18. Data are required on freshwater species if the end-use product 
is intended to be applied directly to water, or is expected to be 
transported to water from the intended use site, and when any of the 
following conditions apply:
    i. If the estimated environmental concentration (EEC) is >= 0.1 of 
the no-observed-effect level in the fish early-life stage or 
invertebrate life cycle test;
    ii. If studies of other organisms indicate that the reproductive 
physiology of fish may be affected.
    19. Not required when:
    i. The octanol/water partition coefficients of the pesticide and its 
major degradates are < 1,000; or
    ii. There are no potential exposures to fish and other nontarget 
aquatic organisms; or
    iii. The hydrolytic half-life is < 5 days at pH 5, 7 and 9.
    20. Data are required based on the results of lower tier studies 
such as acute and chronic aquatic organism testing, intended use 
pattern, and environmental fate characteristics that indicate 
significant potential exposure.
    21. Data are required if:
    i. The half-life of the pesticide in the sediment is <= 10 days in 
either the aerobic soil or aquatic metabolism studies and if any of the 
following conditions exist:
    A. The soil partition coefficient (Kd) is >= 50.
    B. The log Kow is >= 3.
    C. The Koc >= 1,000.
    ii. Registrants must consult with the Agency on appropriate test 
protocols prior to designing the study.
    22. Data are required if:
    i. The estimated environmental concentration (EEC) in sediment is > 
0.1 of the acute LC<INF>50</INF>/EC<INF>50</INF> values and
    ii. The half-life of the pesticide in the sediment is > 10 days in 
either the aerobic soil or aquatic metabolism studies and if any of the 
following conditions exist:
    A. The soil partition coefficient (Kd) is >= 50.
    B. The log Kow is >= 3.
    C. The Koc >= 1,000.
    iii. Registrants must consult with the Agency on appropriate test 
protocols prior to designing the study.
    23. Sediment testing with estuarine/marine test species is required 
if the product is intended for direct application to the estuarine or 
marine environment or the product is expected to enter this environment 
in concentrations which the Agency believes to be significant, either by 
runoff or erosion, because of its expected use or mobility pattern.
    24. Data are required only when the formulation contains one or more 
active ingredients having an acute LD<INF>50</INF> of < 11 micrograms 
per bee as determined in the honey bee acute contact study and the use 
pattern(s) indicate(s) that honey bees may be exposed to the pesticide.
    25. Required if any of the following conditions are met:
    i. Data from other sources (Experimental Use Permit program, 
university research, registrant submittals, etc.) indicate potential 
adverse effects on colonies, especially effects other than acute 
mortality (reproductive, behavioral, etc.);
    ii. Data from residual toxicity studies indicate extended residual 
toxicity.
    iii. Data derived from studies with terrestrial arthropods other 
than bees indicate potential chronic, reproductive or behavioral 
effects.
    26. The freshwater fish test species for the TEP testing is the most 
sensitive of the species tested with the TGAI. Freshwater invertebrate 
and acute estuarine and marine organisms must also be tested with the EP 
or TEP using the same species tested with the TGAI.

    (e) Test notes. The following test notes apply to the table in 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    1. Not required for contained pesticide treatments such as bait 
boxes and pheromone traps unless adverse effects reports are received by 
the Agency.
    2. Not required for known phytotoxicants.
    3. Generally not required for granular formulations. May be 
requested on a case-by-case basis.
    4. Required for known phytotoxicants such as herbicides, desiccants 
and defoliants.
    5. Required if a tested terrestrial species exhibits a 25 percent or 
greater detrimental effect in the Tier I study. When Tier II testing is 
required, the test species should be the species that showed detrimental 
effects in the Tier I testing.
    6. Required if the tested aquatic species exhibits a 50 percent or 
greater detrimental effect in the Tier I study. When Tier II testing is 
required, the test species should be the species that showed detrimental 
effects in the tier I testing.
    7. Not required for aquatic residential uses.
    8. Environmental chemistry methods used to generate data must 
include the results of a successful confirmatory method trial by an 
independent laboratory.

[[Page 127]]

    9. Tests are required on a case-by-case basis based on the results 
of lower tier phytotoxicity studies, adverse incident reports, intended 
use pattern, and environmental fate characteristics that indicate 
potential exposure.
    10. Registrants must consult with the Agency on appropriate test 
protocols prior to designing the study.

Sec. 158.1000  Applicator exposure--general requirements.

    (a) If EPA determines that industrial standards, such as the 
workplace standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA), provide adequate protection from risk under FIFRA 
for a particular pesticide use pattern, exposure data may not be 
required for that use pattern. Applicants should consult with the Agency 
on appropriate testing prior to the initiation of studies.
    (b) The Agency may accept surrogate exposure data estimations from 
other sources to satisfy applicator exposure data requirements if the 
data meet the basic quality assurance, quality control, good laboratory 
practice, and other scientific requirements set by EPA. In order to be 
acceptable, the Agency must find that the surrogate exposure data 
estimations have adequate information to address applicator exposure 
data requirements and contain adequate replicates of acceptable quality 
data to reflect the specific use prescribed on the label and the 
applicator activity of concern, including formulation type, application 
methods and rates, type of activity, and other pertinent information. 
The Agency will consider using such surrogate data for evaluating human 
exposure on a case-by-case basis.


<R05>
Sec. 158.1010  Applicator exposure--criteria for testing.

    Applicator exposure data described in paragraph (d) of this section 
are required based on toxicity and exposure criteria. Data are required 
if a product meets, as determined by the Agency, at least one of the 
toxicity criteria in paragraph (a) of this section and either or both of 
the exposure criteria in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (a) Toxicity criteria. (1) Evidence of potentially significant 
adverse effects have been observed in any applicable toxicity study.
    (2) Scientifically sound epidemiological or poisoning incident data 
indicate that adverse health effects may have resulted from handling of 
the pesticide.
    (b) Exposure criteria. (1) Dermal exposure may occur during the 
prescribed use.
    (2) Respiratory exposure may occur during the prescribed use.

particular pesticide product. Notes that apply to an individual test and 
include specific conditions, qualifications, or exceptions to the 
designated test are listed in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (b) Use patterns. (1) Occupational use patterns include products 
classified under the general use patterns of terrestrial food crop, 
terrestrial feed crop, terrestrial nonfood crop, aquatic food, aquatic 
nonfood use, forestry, greenhouse food, greenhouse nonfood, indoor food 
use, and indoor nonfood use. Occupational use patterns also include 
commercial (``for hire'') applications to residential outdoor and indoor 
sites.
    (2) Residential use patterns include residential outdoor use and 
residential indoor use. These use patterns are limited to 
nonoccupational, i.e., nonprofessional, pesticide applications.

Sec. 158.1050  Post-application exposure--general requirements.

    (a) If EPA determines that industrial standards, such as the 
workplace standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration, provide adequate protection for a particular pesticide 
use pattern, post-application exposure data may not be required for that 
use pattern. Applicants should consult with the Agency on appropriate 
testing before the initiation of studies.
    (b) The Agency may accept surrogate exposure data from other sources 
to satisfy post-application exposure data requirements if the data meet 
the basic quality assurance, quality control, good laboratory practice, 
and other scientific needs of EPA. In order to be acceptable, among 
other things, the Agency must find that the surrogate exposure data have 
adequate information to address post-application exposure data 
requirements and contain adequate replicates of acceptable quality data 
to reflect the specific use prescribed on the label and the post-
application activity of concern, including formulation type, application 
methods and rates, type of activity, and other pertinent information. 
The Agency will consider using such surrogate data for evaluating human 
exposure on a case-by-case basis.


<R05>
Sec. 158.1060  Post-application exposure--criteria for testing

    Exposure data described in Sec. 158.1070(d) are required based upon 
toxicity and exposure criteria. Data are required if a product meets, as 
determined by the Agency, either or both of the toxicity criteria in 
paragraph (a) of this section and either or both of the exposure 
criteria in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (a) Toxicity criteria. (1) Evidence of potentially significant 
adverse health effects have been observed in any applicable toxicity 
study.
    (2) Scientifically sound epidemiological or poisoning incident data 
indicate that adverse health effects may have resulted from post-
application exposure to the pesticide.
    (b) Exposure criteria. The need for data from potential exposure 
resulting from situations not covered by this paragraph should be 
discussed with the Agency.
    (1) For outdoor uses. (i) Occupational human post-application 
exposure to

[[Page 129]]

pesticide residues on plants or in soil could occur as the result of 
cultivation, pruning, harvesting, mowing or other work-related activity. 
Such uses include agricultural food, feed, and fiber commodities, forest 
trees, ornamental plants, and turf grass.
    (ii) Residential human post-application exposure to pesticide 
residues on plants or in soil could occur. Such uses may include turf 
grass, fruits, vegetables, and ornamentals grown at sites, including, 
but not limited to, homes, parks, and recreation areas.
    (2) For indoor uses. (i) Occupational human post-application 
exposure to pesticide residues could occur following the application of 
the pesticide to indoor spaces or surfaces at agricultural or commercial 
sites, such as, but not limited to, agricultural animal facilities and 
industrial or manufacturing facilities.
    (ii) Residential human post-application exposure to pesticide 
residues could occur following the application of the pesticide to 
indoor spaces or surfaces at residential sites, such as, but not limited 
to homes, daycare centers, hospitals, schools, and other public 
buildings.

Sec. 158.1070  Post-application exposure data requirements table.

    (a) General. Sections 158.100 through 158.130 describe how to use 
this table to determine the post-application data requirements for a 
particular pesticide product. Notes that apply to an individual test and 
include specific conditions, qualifications, or exceptions to the 
designated test are listed in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (b) Use patterns. (1) Occupational use patterns include products 
classified under the general use patterns of terrestrial food crop, 
terrestrial feed crop, terrestrial nonfood use, aquatic food, aquatic 
nonfood use, forestry, greenhouse food, greenhouse nonfood, indoor food, 
and indoor nonfood. Occupational use patterns also include commercial 
(``for hire'') applications to residential outdoor and indoor sites.
    (2) Residential use patterns include residential outdoor use and 
indoor residential use. These use patterns are limited to 
nonoccupational, i.e., nonprofessional, pesticide applications.

    (e) Test notes. The following test notes apply to the data 
requirements in the table to paragraph (d) of this section:
    1. Protocols must be submitted for approval prior to the initiation 
of the study. Details for developing protocols are available from the 
Agency.
    2. Bridging applicable residue dissipation data to dermal exposure 
data is required.
    3. Turf grass transferable residue dissipation data are required 
when pesticides are applied to turf grass. Dislodgeable foliar residue 
dissipation data are required when pesticides are applied to the foliage 
of plants other than turf grass.
    4. Data are required for occupational sites if (i) there are uses on 
turf grass or other plant foliage, and (ii) the human activity data 
indicate that workers are likely to have post-application dermal contact 
with treated foliage while participating in typical activities.
    5. Data are required for residential sites if there are uses on turf 
grass or other plant foliage.
    6. Data are required for occupational sites, if (i) there are 
outdoor or greenhouse uses to or around soil or other planting media, 
and (ii) the human activity data indicate that workers are likely to 
have post-application dermal contact with treated soil or planting media 
while participating in typical activities.
    7. Data are required for residential sites if the pesticide is 
applied to or around soil or other planting media both outdoors and 
indoors, e.g., residential greenhouse or houseplant uses.
    8. Data are required for occupational sites if the pesticide is 
applied to or around on non-plant surfaces, e.g., flooring or 
countertops, and if the human activity data indicate that workers are 
likely to have post-application dermal contact with treated indoor 
surfaces while participating in typical activities.
    9. Data are required for residential sites if the pesticide is 
applied to or around non-plant surfaces, e.g., flooring and countertops.
    10. Data are required for occupational sites if the human activity 
data indicate that workers are likely to have post-application exposures 
while participating in typical activities.
    11. Data are required for residential sites if post-application 
exposures are likely.
    12. Biological monitoring data may be submitted in addition to, or 
in lieu of, dermal and inhalation exposure data provided the human 
pharmocokinetics of the pesticide and/or metabolite/analog compounds 
(i.e., whichever method is selected as an indicator of body burden or 
internal dose) allow for a back-calculation to the total internal dose.
    13. Data are required when passive dosimetry techniques are not 
applicable for a particular exposure scenario, such as a swimmer 
exposure to pesticides.
    14. Data reporting and calculations are required when any post-
application exposure monitoring data are submitted.
    15. The selection of a sampling method will depend on the nondietary 
pathway(s) of interest. Data must be generated to consider all potential 
pathways of nondietary ingestion exposure that are applicable (e.g., 
soil ingestion, hand-to-mouth transfer, and object-to-mouth transfer of 
surface residues).

    (e) Test notes. The following test notes apply to the requirements 
in the table to paragraph (d) of this section:
    1. Study is required for indoor uses in cases where environmental 
exposure is likely to occur. Such sites include, but are not limited to, 
agricultural premises, in or around farm buildings, barnyards, and 
beehives.
    2. Not required when the electronic absorption spectra, measured at 
pHs 5, 7, and 9, of the chemical and its hydrolytic products, if any, 
show no absorption or tailing between 290 and 800 nm.
    3. Not required when the chemical is to be applied only by soil 
injection or is incorporated in the soil.
    4. Requirement based on use patterns and other pertinent factors 
including, but not limited to, the Henry's Law Constant of the chemical. 
In view of methodological difficulties with the study of 
photodegradation in air, prior consultation with the Agency regarding 
the protocol is recommended before the test is performed.
    5. Required for aquatic food and nonfood crop uses for aquatic sites 
that are intermittently dry. Such sites include, but are not limited to, 
cranberry bogs and rice paddies.
    6. Adsorption and desorption using a batch equilibrium method is 
preferred. However in some cases, for example, where the pesticide 
degrades rapidly, soil column leaching with unaged or aged columns may 
be more appropriate to fully characterize the potential mobility of the 
parent compound and major transformation products.
    7. Environmental chemistry methods used to generate data associated 
with this study must include results of a successful confirmatory method 
trial by an independent laboratory. Test standards and procedures for 
independent laboratory validation are available as addenda to the 
guideline for this test requirement.
    8. Requirement for terrestrial uses is based on potential for 
aquatic exposure and if pesticide residues have the potential for 
persistence, mobility, nontarget aquatic toxicity or bioaccumulation. 
Not required for aquatic residential uses. Field testing under the 
terrestrial field dissipation requirement may be more appropriate for 
some aquatic food crops, such as rice and cranberry uses, that are 
managed to have a dry-land period for production. The registrant is 
encouraged to consult with the Agency on protocols.
    9. Agency approval of a protocol is necessary prior to initiation of 
the study.
    10. This study may be triggered if there is specific evidence that 
the presence of one pesticide can affect the dissipation characteristics 
of another pesticide when applied simultaneously or serially.
    11. Required if the weight-of-evidence indicates that the pesticide 
and/or its degradates is likely to leach to ground water, taking into 
account other factors such as the toxicity of the chemicals(s), 
available monitoring data, and the vulnerability of ground water 
resources in the pesticide use area.
    12. If the terrestrial dissipation study cannot assess all of the 
major routes of dissipation, the forestry study will be required.

                       Subpart O_Residue Chemistry


<R05>
Sec. 158.1400  Definitions.

    The following terms are defined for the purposes of this subpart:
    Livestock, for the purposes of this section, includes all domestic 
animals that are bred for human consumption, including, but not limited 
to, cattle, swine, sheep, and poultry.
    Plant or animal metabolite means a pesticide chemical residue that 
is the result of biological breakdown of the parent pesticide within the 
plant or animal.
    Residue of concern means the parent pesticidal compound and its 
metabolites, degradates, and impurities of toxicological concern.
    Tolerance, for the purposes of this section, includes the 
establishment of a new tolerance or tolerance exemption, or amended 
tolerance or tolerance exemption.


<R05>
Sec. 158.1410  Residue chemistry data requirements table.

    (a) General. Sections 158.100 through 158.130 describe how to use 
this table to determine the residue chemistry data requirements for a 
particular pesticide product. Notes that apply to an individual test and 
include specific conditions, qualifications, or exceptions to the 
designated test are listed in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (b) Use patterns. (1) Data are required or conditionally required 
for all pesticides used in or on food and for residential outdoor uses 
where food crops are grown. Food use patterns include products 
classified under the general use patterns of terrestrial food crop use, 
terrestrial feed crop use, aquatic food crop use, greenhouse food crop 
use, and indoor food use.
    (2) Data may be required for nonfood uses if pesticide residues may 
occur in food or feed as a result of the use. Data requirements for 
these nonfood uses will be determined on a case-by-case basis. For 
example, most products used in or near kitchens require residue data for 
risk assessment purposes even though tolerances may not be necessary in 
all cases.
    (c) Key. R=Required; CR=Conditionally required; NR=Not required; 
TGAI=Technical grade of the active ingredient; PAI=Pure active 
ingredient; PAIRA=Pure active ingredient radio-labeled; Residue of 
concern= the active ingredient and its metabolites, degradates, and 
impurities of toxicological concern; TEP=Typical end-use product.
    (d) Table. The following table list the data requirements for 
residue chemistry related to food uses. The table notes are shown in 
paragraph (e) of this section.

                                                                    Table--Residue Chemistry Data Requirements for Food Uses

    (e) Test notes. The following test notes apply to the data 
requirements in the table to paragraph (d) of this section.
    1. Required if indoor use could result in pesticide residues in or 
on food or feed.
    2. Material safety data sheets must accompany standards as specified 
by OSHA in 29 CFR 1910.1200.
    3. Required for residential outdoor uses on food crops if the 
corresponding agricultural use is not approved or the residential use is 
expected to produce higher residues based on the label directions.
    4. Required for indoor uses where the pesticide is applied directly 
to food, in order to determine metabolites and/or degradates. Not 
required when only indirect contact with food would occur (e.g., crack 
and crevice treatments).
    5. Data for fish are required for all pesticides applied directly to 
water inhabited, or which will be inhabited, by fish that may be caught 
or harvested for human consumption.

[[Page 136]]

    6. Required when a pesticide is to be applied directly to livestock, 
to livestock premises, to livestock drinking water, or to crops used for 
livestock feed. If results from the plant metabolism study show 
differing metabolites in plants from those found in animals, an 
additional livestock metabolism study involving dosing with the plant 
metabolite(s) may also be required.
    7. Required when the Agency determines that it is reasonably 
foreseeable that a food or feed crop could be subsequently planted on 
the site of pesticide application after harvest or failure of the 
treated crop. Typically not required for pesticide uses in permanent 
food crops (e.g., various tree crops, vines) or semi-permanent crops 
(e.g., asparagus, pineapples).
    8. A residue analytical method suitable for enforcement purposes is 
required whenever a numeric tolerance (including temporary and time-
limited tolerances) is proposed.
    9. New analytical methods to be used for enforcement purposes must 
include results from an independent laboratory validation.
    10. A residue method, storage stability data, and crop field trials 
are required for the nonfood crop tobacco (green, freshly harvested). 
Depending on the level of residues found on the green tobacco, 
additional data may be required on cured/dried tobacco and pyrolysis 
products.
    11. Data are required to determine whether FDA/USDA multiresidue 
methodology would detect and identify the pesticides and any 
metabolites.
    12. Data are required for any magnitude of the residue study unless 
analytical samples are stored frozen for 30 days or less, and the active 
ingredient is not known to be volatile or labile.
    13. Studies using single serving samples of a raw agricultural 
commodity may be needed for acutely toxic pesticides and/or their 
metabolites. These residue studies must be conducted using a statistical 
design accepted by the Agency.
    14. Required for indoor uses which are direct postharvest treatments 
of raw agricultural commodities (e.g., fungicidal waxes or stored grain 
fumigants).
    15. Data on the nature and level of residues in processed food/feed 
are required if residues could potentially concentrate on processing 
thus requiring the establishment of a separate tolerance higher than 
that of the raw agricultural commodity.
    16. Required when the pesticide use is a direct application to 
livestock.
    17. Data are required if pesticide residues are present in or on 
livestock feed items or intentionally added to drinking water. These 
studies, however, may not be required in cases where the livestock 
metabolism studies indicate negligible transfer of the pesticide's 
residues of concern to tissues, milk, and eggs at the maximum expected 
exposure level for the animals.
    18. If results from the plant metabolism study show differing 
metabolites in plants from those found in animals, an additional 
livestock feeding study involving dosing with the plant metabolite(s) 
may also be required.
    19. Data are required whenever a pesticide may be applied directly 
to water, unless it can be demonstrated that the treated water would not 
be available for human or livestock consumption.
    20. Data are required when a pesticide is to be applied directly to 
water that could be used for irrigation or to irrigation facilities such 
as irrigation ditches.
    21. Data are required whenever a pesticide may be used in a food 
handling or feed handling establishment.
    22. Required when residues at the tolerance level may result in a 
risk of concern. These data may include washing, cooking, processing or 
degradation studies as well as market basket surveys for a more precise 
residue determination.
    23. Typically required if pesticide residues of concern greater than 
0.01 ppm are found in crops at the appropriate plant back intervals 
(taking into account plant back restrictions on product labels) in the 
confined rotational crop study. If residues of concern in the confined 
study are greater than 0.01 ppm but less than the limit of quantitation 
of the analytical method to be used on field trial samples, the Agency 
will consider not requiring, on a case-by-case basis, the limited field 
trials. If there are particular toxicological concerns with the parent 
pesticide or any metabolites, limited field studies may be needed if 
such residues are identified at levels below 0.01 ppm in the confined 
study.
    24. Crop field trials are required to establish tolerances on 
rotational crops when quantifiable residues of concern are observed in 
the field rotational crops study.
    25. Not required for an exemption from a tolerance provided that 
dietary exposure estimates are not needed due to low toxicity or that 
theoretical estimates of exposure are adequate to assess dietary risk.
    26. Not required for an exemption from a tolerance.

Sec. 158.2000  Biochemical pesticides definition and applicability.

    This subpart applies to all biochemical pesticides as defined in 
paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section.
    (a) Definitions. The following terms are defined for the purposes of 
subpart U of this part.
    (1) A biochemical pesticide is a pesticide that:
    (i) Is a naturally-occurring substance or structurally-similar and 
functionally identical to a naturally-occurring substance;
    (ii) Has a history of exposure to humans and the environment 
demonstrating minimal toxicity, or in the case of a synthetically-
derived biochemical pesticides, is equivalent to a naturally-occurring 
substance that has such a history; and
    (iii) Has a non-toxic mode of action to the target pest(s).
    (2) A Pheromone is a compound produced by a living organism or is a 
synthetically derived substance that is structurally similar and 
functionally identical to a naturally-occurring pheromone, which, alone 
or in combination with other such compounds, modifies the behavior of 
other individuals of the same species.
    (i) An Arthropod Pheromone is a pheromone produced by a member of 
the taxonomic phylum Arthropoda.
    (ii) A Lepidopteran Pheromone is an arthropod pheromone produced by 
a member of the insect order Lepidoptera.
    (iii) A Straight Chain Lepidopteran Pheromone is a lepidopteran 
pheromone consisting of an unbranched aliphatic chain (between 9 and 18 
carbons) ending in an alcohol, aldehyde, or acetate functional group and 
containing up to three double bonds in the aliphatic backbone.
    (b) Examples. Biochemical pesticides include, but are not limited 
to:
    (1) Semiochemicals (insect pheromones and kairomones),
    (2) Natural plant and insect regulators,
    (3) Naturally-occurring repellents and attractants, and
    (4) Enzymes.
    (c) Applicability. The Agency may review, on a case-by-case basis, 
naturally-occurring pesticides that do not clearly meet the definition 
of a biochemical pesticide in an effort to ensure, to the greatest 
extent possible, that only the minimum testing sufficient to make 
scientifically sound regulatory decisions would be conducted. The Agency 
will review applications for registration of naturally-occurring 
pesticides to determine whether to review the pesticide under this 
subpart U.

Sec. 158.2010  Biochemical pesticides data requirements.

    (a) Sections 158.2030 through 158.2070 identify the data 
requirements that are required to support registration of biochemical 
pesticides. Sections 158.2080 through 158.2084 identify the data 
requirements that are required to support Experimental Use Permits 
(EUPs). Variations in the test conditions are identified within the test 
notes. Definitions that apply to all biochemical data requirements can 
be found in Sec. 158.2000.
    (b) Each data table includes ``use patterns'' under which the 
individual data are required, with variations including food and nonfood 
uses for terrestrial and aquatic applications, greenhouse, indoor, 
forestry, and residential outdoor applications under certain 
circumstances.
    (c) The categories for each data requirement are ``R'', which stands 
for required, and ``CR'' which stands for conditionally required. 
Generally, ``R'' indicates that the data are more likely required than 
for those data requirements with ``CR.'' However, in each case, the 
regulatory text preceding the data table and the test notes following 
the data table must be used to determine whether the data requirement 
must be satisfied.
    (d) Each table identifies the test substance that is required to be 
tested to satisfy the data requirement. Test substances may include: 
technical grade active ingredient (TGAI), manufacturing-use product 
(MP), end-use product (EP), typical end-use product (TEP), residue of 
concern, and pure active ingredient (PAI) or all of the above (All). 
Commas between the test substances (i.e., TGAI, EP) indicate that data 
may be required on the TGAI or

[[Page 138]]

EP or both depending on the conditions set forth in the test note.
    (e) The data requirements are organized into a tier-testing system 
with specified additional studies at higher tiers being required if 
warranted by adverse effects observed in lower tier studies. The lower 
tier studies are a subset of those required for conventional pesticides, 
and the studies overall are generally selected from those required for 
conventional pesticides.
    (f) Two sets of guideline numbers are provided for some of the 
environmental fate data requirements. For ease of understanding, the 
current guidelines will be used as an interim measure until the new 
guidelines (in parentheses) are finalized.

Sec. 158.2030  Biochemical pesticides product chemistry data requirements table.

    (a) General. (1) Sections 158.100 through 158.130 describe how to 
use this table to determine the product chemistry data requirements for 
a particular pesticide product. Notes that apply to an individual test 
and include specific conditions, qualifications, or exceptions to the 
designated test are listed in paragraph (e) of the section.
    (2) Definitions in Sec. 158.300 apply to data requirements in this 
section.
    (b) Use patterns. Product chemistry data are required for all 
pesticide products and are not use specific.
    (c) Key. R=Required; CR=Conditionally required; NR=Not required; 
MP=Manufacturing-use product; EP=End-use product; TEP=Typical end-use 
product; TGAI=Technical grade of the active ingredient; Residue of 
concern=the active ingredient and its metabolites, degradates, and 
impurities of toxicological concern; All=All of the above.
    (d) Table. The following table shows the data requirements for 
biochemical pesticides product chemistry. The test notes are shown in 
paragraph (e) of this section.

    (e) Test notes. The following test notes are applicable to the data 
requirements for biochemical pesticides product chemistry and are 
referenced in the last column of the table in paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    1. Data must be provided in accordance with Sec. 158.320.
    2. If the MP and EP are produced by an integrated formulation system 
(non-registered source), these data are also required on TGAI.
    3. Data must be provided in accordance with Sec. Sec. 158.325, 
158.330, and Sec. 158.335.
    4. Data must be provided in accordance with Sec. 158.340.
    5. Data must be provided in accordance with Sec. 158.345. Also, 
required to support the registration of each manufacturing-use product 
(including registered TGAIs) and end-use products produced by an

Sec. 158.2040  Biochemical pesticides residue data requirements table.

    (a) General. Sections 158.100 through 158.130 describe how to use 
this table to determine the biochemical pesticides residue data 
requirements for a particular pesticide product and the substance that 
needs to be tested. These data requirements apply to all biochemical 
pesticides, i.e., naturally occurring insect repellents and

[[Page 140]]

attractants, semiochemicals (e.g., insect pheromones), natural and plant 
growth regulators. Notes that apply to an individual test and include 
specific conditions, qualifications, or exceptions to the designated 
test are listed in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (b) Use patterns. (1) Data are required or conditionally required 
for all pesticides used in or on food and for residential outdoor uses 
where food crops are grown. Food use patterns include products 
classified under the general use patterns of terrestrial food crop use, 
terrestrial feed crop use, aquatic food crop use, greenhouse food crop 
use, and indoor food use. Data are also conditionally required for 
aquatic nonfood use if there is direct application to water that could 
subsequently result in exposure to food.
    (2) Data are conditionally required for nonfood uses if pesticide 
residues may occur in food or feed as a result of the use. Data 
requirements for these nonfood uses would be determined on a case-by-
case basis. For example, most products used in or near kitchens require 
residue data for risk assessment purposes even though tolerances may not 
be necessary in all cases.
    (c) Key. R=Required; CR=Conditionally required; NR=Not required; 
MP=Manufacturing end-use product; EP=End-use product; TEP=Typical end-
use product; TGAI=Technical grade of the active ingredient; Residue of 
concern=the active ingredient and its metabolites, degradates, and 
impurities of toxicological concern; All=All of the above. Specific 
conditions, qualifications, or exceptions to the designated test 
procedures appear in paragraph (e) of this section, and apply to the 
individual tests in the following table:

    (e) Test notes. The following test notes are applicable to the data 
requirements for biochemical pesticides product chemistry and are in the 
last column of the table contained in paragraph (d) of this section.
    1. Residue chemistry data requirements apply to biochemical 
pesticide products when Tier II or Tier III toxicology data are 
required, as specified for biochemical agents in the biochemical human 
health assessment data requirements, Sec. 158.2050.
    2. The same chemical identity data are required for biochemical 
product chemistry data requirements, Sec. 158.2030, with an emphasis on 
impurities.
    3. Required information includes crops to be treated, rate of 
application, number and timing of applications, preharvest intervals, 
and relevant restrictions.
    4. Required for residential outdoor uses on food crops if the 
corresponding agricultural use is not approved or the residential use is 
expected to produce higher residues based on the label directions.
    5. Required unless it is an arthropod pheromone applied at a rate 
less than or equal to 150 grams active ingredient per acre.
    6. Required for indoor uses where the pesticide is applied directly 
to food, in order to determine metabolites and/or degradates. Not 
required when only indirect contact with food would occur (e.g., crack 
and crevice treatments).
    7. Required when a pesticide is to be applied directly to livestock, 
to livestock premises, to livestock drinking water, or to crops used for 
livestock feed.
    8. If results from the plant metabolism study show differing 
metabolites in plants from those found in animals, an additional 
livestock metabolism study involving dosing with the plant metabolite(s) 
may also be required.
    9. A residue analytical method suitable for enforcement of 
tolerances is required whenever a numeric tolerance (including temporary 
and time-limited tolerances) is proposed.
    10. Required if indoor use could result in pesticide residues in or 
on food or feed.
    11. Data are required to determine whether FDA/USDA multiresidue 
methodology would detect and identify the pesticides and any 
metabolites.
    12. Data are required whenever a pesticide may be applied directly 
to water, unless it can be demonstrated that the treated water would not 
be available for human or livestock consumption.
    13. Data on fish are required for all pesticides applied directly to 
water inhabited, or which will be inhabited by fish that may be caught 
or harvested for human consumption.
    14. Data are required when a pesticide is to be applied directly to 
water that could be used for irrigation or to irrigation facilities such 
as irrigation ditches.
    15. Data are required whenever a pesticide may be used in food/feed 
handling establishments.
    16. Data on the nature and level of residue in processed food/feed 
are required when detectible residues could potentially concentrate on 
processing thus requiring the establishment of a separate tolerance 
higher

[[Page 142]]

than that of the raw agricultural commodity.
    17. Required when residues at the tolerance level may result in risk 
of concern. These data may include washing, cooking, processing, or 
degradation studies as well as market basket surveys for a more precise 
residue determination.
    18. The proposed tolerance must reflect the maximum residue likely 
to occur in crops, in meat, milk, poultry, or eggs.
    19. Required when a residue analytical method is required.

    (e) Test notes. The following test notes are applicable to the data 
requirements for biochemical pesticides human health assessment as 
referenced in the last column of the table in paragraph (d) of this 
section.

    1. Required unless the test material is a gas or highly volatile 
(vapor pressure >10<SUP>-4</SUP>torr (mm/Hg)).

[[Page 144]]

    2. Required unless the test material is corrosive to skin or has pH 
<2 or >11.5.
    3. Required when the pesticide, under conditions of use, would 
result in respirable material (e.g., gas, volatile substance or aerosol/
particulate), unless it is a straight chain lepidopteran pheromone.
    4. Required if repeated contact with human skin is likely to occur 
under conditions of use.
    5. Hypersensitivity incidents must be reported as adverse effects 
data.
    6. Required for non-food uses that are likely to result in repeated 
oral exposure to humans.
    7. Required to support uses involving purposeful application to the 
human skin or which would result in comparable prolonged human exposure 
to the product (e.g., insect repellents) and if any of the following 
criteria are met:
    i. Data from a 90-day oral study are not required.
    ii. The active ingredient is known or expected to be metabolized 
differently by the dermal route of exposure than by the oral route and 
the metabolite is of toxicological concern.
    iii. The use pattern is such that the dermal route would be the 
primary route of exposure.
    8. Required if there is a likelihood of significant levels of 
repeated inhalation exposure to the pesticide as a gas, vapor, or 
aerosol.
    9. Required if the use of the product under widespread and commonly 
recognized practice may reasonably be expected to result in significant 
exposure to female humans (e.g., occupational exposure or repeated 
application of insect repellents directly to the skin). Tier II data is 
required on a different test species from Tier I data when developmental 
effects are observed in the first study and information on species-to-
species extrapolation is needed.
    10. Required to support nonfood uses if either:
    i. The use is likely to result in significant human exposure; or
    ii. The active ingredient (or its metabolites) is structurally 
related to a known mutagen or belongs to any chemical class of compounds 
containing a known mutagen. Additional mutagenicity tests that may have 
been performed plus a complete reference list must also be submitted. 
Subsequent testing may be required based on the available evidence.
    11. Choice of assay using either:
    i. Mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells, thymidine kinase (tk) gene locus, 
maximizing assay conditions for small colony expression or detection;
    ii. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or Chinese hamster lung fibroblast 
(V79) cells, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hgprt) 
gene locus, accompanied by an appropriate in vitro test for 
clastogenicity; or
    iii. CHO cells strains AS52, xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl 
transferase (xprt) gene locus.
    12. Required if there are effects on hematology, clinical chemistry, 
lymphoid organ weights, and histopathology are observed in the 90-day 
studies.
    13. The micronucleus rodent bone marrow assay is preferred; however, 
rodent bone marrow assays using metaphase analysis (aberrations) are 
acceptable.
    14. Required if adverse effects are observed in the Tier II 
immunotoxicity study. The protocol for evaluating adverse effects to the 
immune response should be developed after evaluating the effects noted 
in the immunotoxicity study.
    15. These data are required when the data used for the human health 
assessment indicates that the biochemical may pose a potential hazard to 
the applicator/user.
    16. Required if there is evidence of:
    i. Endocrinological effects from the subchronic toxicity studies.
    ii. Developmental effects in the prenatal developmental toxicity 
study(s), or
    iii. Genotoxicity to mammals based on results from the mutagenicity 
tests.
The use of a combined study that utilizes the two-generation 
reproduction study in rodents (guideline 870.3800) as a basic protocol 
for the addition of other endpoints or functional assessments in the 
immature animal is encouraged.
    17. Required if the potential for adverse chronic effects is 
indicated based on any of the following:
    i. The subchronic effect level established in the following Tier I 
studies: 90-day oral toxicity study, 90-day dermal toxicity study, or 
90-day inhalation toxicity study.
    ii. The pesticide use pattern (e.g., rate, frequency, and site of 
application).
    iii. The frequency and level of repeated human exposure that is 
expected.
    18. Required if the product meets either of the following criteria:
    i. The active ingredient (or any of its metabolites, degradation 
products, or impurities) produce(s) in Tier I subchronic studies a 
morphologic effect (e.g., hyperplasia or metaplasia) in any organ that 
potentially could lead to neoplastic change.
    ii. Adverse cellular effects suggesting carcinogenic potential are 
observed in Tier II immunotoxicity and Tier III immune response study or 
in Tier II mammalian mutagenicity assays.
    In addition, a 90-day range finding study in both rats and mice is 
required to determine the dose levels if carcinogenicity studies are 
required. If the mouse carcinogenicity study is not required, the 90-day 
mouse subchronic study is likewise not required.

[[Page 145]]

    19. Required if results from lower tiered mutation or reproductive 
studies indicate there is potential for chromosomal aberration to occur.
    20. May be required if the product's use will result in exposure to 
domestic animals through, but not limited to, direct application or 
consumption of treated feed.

Sec. 158.2060  Biochemical pesticides nontarget organisms and environmental fate data requirements table.

    (a) General. (1) Sections 158.100 through 158.130 describe how to 
use this table to determine the terrestrial and aquatic nontarget 
organisms and fate data requirements for a particular biochemical 
pesticide product. Notes that apply to an individual test including 
specific conditions, qualifications, or exceptions to the designated 
test are listed in paragraph (e) of this section. In general, for all 
outdoor end-use products including turf, the following studies are 
required: one avian acute oral, one avian dietary, one acute freshwater 
fish, one acute freshwater invertebrate study, plant toxicity testing, 
and a honeybee acute contact study.
    (2) The data in this section are not required for arthropod 
pheromones when applied at up to a maximum use rate of 150 grams active 
ingredient/acre/year except when the product is expected to be available 
to avian species (i.e., granular formulation).
    (b) Use patterns. The terrestrial use pattern includes products 
classified under the general use patterns of terrestrial food crop, 
terrestrial feed crop, and terrestrial nonfood/nonfeed crop. The 
greenhouse use pattern includes products classified under the general 
use patterns of greenhouse food crop and greenhouse nonfood crop. The 
indoor use pattern includes products classified under the general use 
patterns of indoor food and nonfood use. The remaining terrestrial uses 
include: forestry and residential outdoor use. Data are also required 
for the general use patterns of aquatic food and nonfood crop use.
    (c) Key. R=Required; CR=Conditionally required; NR=Not required; 
MP=Manufacturing-use product; EP=End-use product; TEP=Typical end-use 
product; TGAI=Technical grade of the active ingredient; Residue of 
concern=the active ingredient and its metabolites, degradates, and 
impurities of toxicological concern; All=All of the above. Specific 
conditions, qualifications, or exceptions to the designated test 
procedures appear in paragraph (e) of this section, and apply to the 
individual tests in the following table:

    (e) Test notes. The following test notes are applicable to the data 
requirements for biochemical pesticides nontarget organisms and 
environmental fate as referenced in the last column of the table 
contained in paragraph (d) of this section.
    1. Required for the EP when any end-use formulation may contain 
other ingredients that may be toxic to nontarget organisms or to support 
arthropod pheromones that would be available to avian wildlife, (e.g., a 
granular product).
    2. Tests for pesticides intended solely for indoor application would 
be required on a case-by-case basis, depending on use pattern, physical/
chemical properties, production volume, and other pertinent factors.
    3. Not required for any use groups if the pesticide is highly 
volatile (estimated volatility >5 X 10<SUP>-5</SUP>atm m\3\/mol).
    4. Preferred test species are Upland game, waterfowl, or passerine 
for avian acute oral toxicity studies; Upland game and waterfowl for 
avian dietary studies; and coldwater fish species for acute freshwater 
fish studies.
    5. Required for the EP when the end-use formulation may contain 
other ingredients that may be toxic to nontarget organisms.
    6. Required on a case-by-case basis when results from Tier I studies 
indicate adverse effects.
    7. Required when results of any one or more of the nontarget 
organism studies in Tier I indicate potential adverse effects on 
nontarget organisms and the pesticide is to be applied on land. In view 
of methdological difficulties with the study of photodegradation in air, 
prior consultation with the Agency regarding the protocol is recommended 
before the test is performed.
    8. Required when results of any one or more of the nontarget 
organism studies in Tier I indicate potential adverse effects on 
nontarget organisms and the pesticide is to be applied in a passive 
dispenser.
    9. Required to support registration of known phytotoxicants, i.e., 
herbicides, desiccants, defoliants, and plant growth regulators.
    10. Required if environmental fate characteristics indicate that the 
estimated environmental concentration of the pesticide in the aquatic 
environment is >0.01 of any EC<INF>50</INF>

[[Page 148]]

or LC<INF>50</INF> determined in the aquatic nontarget organism testing.
    11. Required if either of the following criteria are met:
    i. Environmental fate characteristics indicate that the estimated 
concentration of the pesticide in the terrestrial environment is > 0.20 
the avian dietary LC<INF>50</INF> or equal to > 0.20 the avian oral 
single dose LD<INF>50</INF> (converted to ppm).
    ii. The pesticide or any of its metabolites or degradation products 
are stable in the environment to the extent that potentially toxic 
amounts may persist in the avian or mammalian feed.
    12. Required when results of Tier I nontarget organism studies 
indicate potential adverse effects on nontarget insects and results of 
Tier II tests indicate exposure of nontarget insects. Additional insect 
species may have to be tested if necessary to address issues raised by 
use patterns and potential exposure of important nontarget insect 
species, (e.g., threatened or endangered species).
    13. Required if the product is expected to be transported from the 
site of application by air, soil, or water. The extent of movement would 
be determined by the results of the Tier II environmental fate studies.
    14. Required depending on pesticide mode of action, method and 
timing of application, and results of any available efficacy data. 
Typically the honeybee acute toxicity guideline (guideline 850.3020) 
satisfies this requirement, however, additional nontarget insect species 
may have to be tested if necessary to address issues raised by use 
patterns and potential exposure of important nontarget insect species, 
(e.g., endangered species.)


<R05>
Sec. 158.2070  Biochemical pesticides product performance data requirements.

    Product performance data must be developed for all biochemical 
pesticides. However, the Agency typically does not require applicants to 
submit such efficacy data unless the pesticide product bears a claim to 
control public health pests, such as pest microorganisms infectious to 
man in any area of the inanimate environment or a claim to control 
vertebrates (including but not limited to: rodents, birds, bats, canids, 
and skunks) or invertebrates (including but not limited to: mosquitoes 
and ticks) that may directly or indirectly transmit diseases to humans. 
However, each registrant must ensure through testing that his products 
are efficacious when used in accordance with label directions and 
commonly accepted pest control practices. The Agency reserves the right 
to require, on a case-by-case basis, submission of efficacy data for any 
pesticide product registered or proposed for registration.


<R05>
Sec. 158.2080  Experimental use permit data requirements--biochemical pesticides.

    (a) Sections 158.2081 through 158.2084 describe the experimental use 
permit (EUP) data requirements for biochemical pesticides. Variations in 
the test conditions are identified within the test notes. Definitions 
that apply to all biochemical data requirements can be found in Sec. 
158.2000.
    (b) For general information on the data requirement tables, see 
Sec. 158.2010(b)-(f).


<R05>
Sec. 158.2081  Experimental use permit biochemical pesticides product chemistry data requirements table.

    (a) General. (1) Sections 158.100 through 158.130 describe how to 
use this table to determine the product chemistry data requirements for 
a particular biochemical pesticide product. Notes that apply to an 
individual test and include specific conditions, qualifications, or 
exceptions to the designated test are listed in paragraph (e) of the 
section.
    (2) Depending on the results of the required product chemistry 
studies, appropriate use restrictions, labeling requirements, or special 
packaging requirements may be imposed.
    (b) Use patterns. Product chemistry data are required for all 
pesticide products and are not use specific.
    (c) Key. R=Required; CR=Conditionally required; NR=Not required; 
MP=Manufacturing-use product; EP=End-use product; TEP=Typical end-use 
product; TGAI=Technical grade of the active ingredient; Residue of 
concern=the active ingredient and its metabolites, degradates, and 
impurities of toxicological concern; All=All of the above. Specific 
conditions, qualifications, or exceptions to the designated test 
procedures appear in paragraph (e) of this section, and apply to the 
individual tests in the following table:

    (e) Test notes. The following test notes are applicable to the data 
requirements for experimental use permit biochemical pesticides product 
chemistry and are referenced in the last column of the table in 
paragraph (d) of this section.

[[Page 150]]

    1. Data must be provided in accordance with Sec. 158.320.
    2. If the MP and EP are produced by an integrated formulation system 
(non-registered source), these data are also required on TGAI.
    3. Data must be provided in accordance with Sec. 158.325, Sec. 
158.330, and Sec. 158.335.
    4. Data must be provided in accordance with Sec. 158.340.
    5. Data must be provided in accordance with Sec. 158.345. Also, 
required to support the registration of each manufacturing-use product 
(including registered TGAIs) and end-use products produced by an 
integrated formulation system. Data on other end-use products would be 
required on a case-by-case basis. For pesticides in the production 
stage, a preliminary product analytical method and data would suffice to 
support an experimental use permit.
    6. Data must be provided in accordance with Sec. 158.350.
    7. Data must be provided in accordance with Sec. 158.355.
    8. If the TGAI cannot be isolated, data are required on the 
practical equivalent of the TGAI. EP testing may also be appropriate.
    9. Required if the product contains combustible liquids.
    10. Required if the product is an emulsifiable liquid and is to be 
diluted with petroleum solvents.
    11. Required if the test substance is soluble or dispersible in 
water.
    12. Required if the product is a liquid.
    13. Required when the technical chemical is a solid at room 
temperature.
    14. Required when the technical chemical is a liquid at room 
temperature.
    15. Required for water insoluble test substances (>10<SUP>-6</SUP>g/
l) and fibrous test substances with diameter >=0.1 [micro]m.
    16. Required for organic chemicals unless they dissociate in water 
or are partially or completely soluble in water.
    17. Data on the stability to metals and metal ions is required only 
if the active ingredient is expected to come in contact with either 
material during storage.
    18. True density or specific density are required for all test 
substances. Data on bulk density is required for MPs or EPs that are 
solid at room temperature.
    19. Not required for salts.

Sec. 158.2082  Experimental use permit biochemical pesticides residue data requirements table.

    (a) General. Sections 158.100 through 158.130 describe how to use 
this table to determine the biochemical pesticides residue data 
requirements for a particular pesticide product and the substance that 
needs to be tested. These data requirements apply to all biochemical 
pesticides, i.e., naturally occurring insect repellents and attractants, 
semiochemicals (e.g., insect pheromones), natural and plant growth 
regulators. Notes that apply to an individual test and include specific 
conditions, qualifications, or exceptions to the designated test are 
listed in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (b) Use patterns. (1) Data are required or conditionally required 
for all pesticides used in or on food and for residential outdoor uses 
where food crops are grown. Food use patterns include products 
classified under the general use patterns of terrestrial food crop use, 
terrestrial feed crop use, aquatic food crop use, greenhouse food crop 
use, and indoor food use. Data are also conditionally required for 
aquatic nonfood use if there is direct application to water that could 
subsequently result in exposure to food.
    (2) Data are conditionally required for nonfood uses if pesticide 
residues may occur in food or feed as a result of the use. Data 
requirements for these nonfood uses would be determined on a case-by-
case basis. For example, most products used in or near kitchens require 
residue data for risk assessment purposes even though tolerances may not 
be necessary in all cases.
    (c) Key. R=Required; CR=Conditionally required; NR=Not required; 
MP=Manufacturing end-use product; EP=End-use product; TEP=Typical end-
use product; TGAI=Technical grade of the active ingredient; Residue of 
concern=the active ingredient and its metabolites, degradates,and 
impurities of toxicological concern. All=All of the above. Specific 
conditions, qualifications, or exceptions to the designated test 
procedures appear in paragraph (e) of this section, and apply to the 
individual tests in the following table:

    (e) Test notes. The following test notes are applicable to the data 
requirements for biochemical pesticides product chemistry and are 
referenced referenced in the last column of the table contained in 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    1. Residue chemistry data requirements apply to biochemical 
pesticide products when Tier II or Tier III toxicology data are 
required, as specified for biochemical agents in the biochemical human 
health assessment data requirements, Sec. 158.2050.
    2. The same chemical identity data are required for biochemical 
product chemistry data requirements,Sec. 158.2030 with an emphasis on 
impurities.
    3. Required information includes crops to be treated, rate of 
application, number and timing of applications, preharvest intervals, 
and relevant restrictions.
    4. Required for residential outdoor uses on food crops if the 
corresponding agricultural use is not approved or the residential use is 
expected to produce higher residues based on the label directions.
    5. Required unless it is an arthropod pheromone applied at a rate 
less than or equal to 150 grams active ingredient per acre.
    6. Required for indoor uses where the pesticide is applied directly 
to food, in order to determine metabolites and/or degradates. Not 
required when only indirect contact with food would occur (e.g., crack 
and crevice treatments).
    7. Required when a pesticide is to be applied directly to livestock, 
to livestock premises, to livestock drinking water, or to crops used for 
livestock feed. If results from

[[Page 152]]

the plant metabolism study show differing metabolites in plants form 
those found in animals, an additional livestock metabolism study 
involving dosing with the plant metabolite(s) may also be required.
    8. Livestock feeding studies are required whenever a pesticide 
residue is present in livestock feed or when direct application to 
livestock uses occurs.
    9. Required if indoor use could result in pesticide residues in or 
on food or feed.
    10. Data are required to determine whether FDA/USDA multiresidue 
methodology would detect and identify the pesticides and any 
metabolites.
    11. Data are required whenever a pesticide may be applied directly 
to water, unless it can be demonstrated that the treated water would not 
be available for human or livestock consumption.
    12. Data on fish are required for all pesticides applied directly to 
water inhabited, or which will be inhabited, by fish that may be caught 
or harvested for human consumption.
    13. Data are required when a pesticide is to be applied directly to 
water that could be used for irrigation or to irrigation facilities such 
as irrigation ditches.
    14. Data are required whenever a pesticide may be used in food/feed 
handling establishments.
    15. Data on the nature and level of residue in processed food/feed 
are required when detectible residues could potentially concentrate on 
processing thus requiring the establishment of a separate tolerance 
higher than that of the raw agricultural commodity.
    16 Anticipated residue data are required when the assumption of 
tolerance level residues would result in predicted exposure at an unsafe 
level of exposure. Data, using single serving samples of a raw 
agricultural commodity, on the level or residue in food as consumed 
would be used to obtain a more precise estimate of potential dietary 
exposure. These data may also include washing, cooking, processing or 
degradation studies as well as market basket surveys for a more precise 
residue determination.
    17. The proposed tolerance must reflect the maximum residue likely 
to occur in crops, in meat, milk, poultry, or eggs.
    18. Required when a residue analytical method is required.

    (e) Test notes. The following test notes are applicable to the data 
requirements for experimental use permit biochemical pesticides human 
health assessment as referenced in the last column of the table in 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    1. Required unless the test material is a gas or highly volatile 
(vapor pressure > 10<SUP>-4</SUP>torr (mm/Hg)).
    2. Required unless the test material is corrosive to skin or has pH 
<2 or >11.5.
    3. Required when the pesticide, under conditions of use, would 
result in respirable material (e.g., gas, volatile substance or aerosol/
particulate), unless it is a straight chain lepidopteran pheromone.
    4. Hypersensitivity incidents must be reported as adverse effects 
data.
    5. Required if the use of the product under widespread and commonly 
recognized practice may reasonably be expected to result in significant 
exposure to female humans (e.g., occupational exposure or repeated 
application of insect repellents directly to the skin). Tier II data is 
required on a different test species from Tier I data when developmental 
effects are observed in the first study and information on species-to-
species extrapolation is needed.
    6. Required to support nonfood uses if either:
    i. The use is likely to result in significant human exposure; or
    ii. The active ingredient (or its metabolites) is structurally 
related to a known mutagen or belongs to any chemical class of compounds 
containing a known mutagen.

    Additional mutagenicity tests that may have been performed plus a 
complete reference list must also be submitted. Subsequent testing may 
be required based on the available evidence.
    7. Choice of assay using either:
    i. Mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells, thymidine kinase (tk) gene locus, 
maximizing

[[Page 154]]

assay conditions for small colony expression or detection;
    ii. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or Chinese hamster lung fibroblast 
(V79) cells, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hgprt) 
gene locus, accompanied by an appropriate in vivo test for 
clastogenicity; or
    iii. CHO cells strains AS52, xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl 
transferase (xprt) gene locus.

organisms and environmental fate data requirements table.

    (a) General. (1) Sections 158.100 through 158.130 describe how to 
use this table to determine the terrestrial and aquatic nontarget 
organisms and fate data requirements for a particular biochemical 
pesticide product. Notes that apply to an individual test including 
specific conditions, qualifications, or exceptions to the designated 
test are listed in paragraph (e) of this section. In general, for all 
outdoor end-use products including turf, the following studies are 
required: one avian acute oral, one avian dietary, one acute freshwater 
fish, and one acute freshwater invertebrate study.
    (2) The data in this section are not required for arthropod 
pheromones when applied at up to a maximum use rate of 150 grams active 
ingredient/acre/year except when the product is expected to be available 
to avian species (i.e., granular formulation).
    (b) Use patterns. The terrestrial use pattern includes products 
classified under the general use patterns of terrestrial food crop, 
terrestrial feed crop, and terrestrial nonfood/nonfeed crop. The 
greenhouse use pattern includes products classified under the general 
use patterns of greenhouse food crop and greenhouse nonfood crop. The 
indoor use pattern includes products classified under the general use 
patterns of indoor food and nonfood use. The remaining terrestrial uses 
include forestry and residential outdoor use. Data are also required for 
the general use patterns of aquatic food and nonfood crop use.

requirements for experimental use permit biochemical pesticides 
nontarget organisms and environmental fate as referenced in the last 
column of the table contained in paragraph (d) of this section.
    1. Required for the EP when any end-use formulation may contain 
other ingredients that may be toxic to nontarget organisms or to support 
arthropod pheromones that would be available to avian wildlife, (e.g., a 
granular product).
    2. Not required for any use groups if the pesticide is highly 
volatile (estimated volatility >5 X 10<SUP>-5</SUP>atm m\3\/mol).
    3. Preferred test species are: upland game, waterfowl, or passerine 
for avian acute oral toxicity studies; upland game or waterfowl for 
avian dietary studies; and coldwater fish for acute freshwater fish 
studies.
    4. Required for the EP when the end-use formulation may contain 
other ingredients that may be toxic to nontarget organisms.

    Source: 72 FR 61002, Oct. 26, 2007, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 158.2100  Microbial pesticides definition and applicability.

    (a) This subpart applies to all living or dead microbial pesticides 
as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) Definition. Microbial pesticide is a microbial agent intended 
for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest, or 
intended for use as a plant regulator, defoliant, or desiccant, that:
    (1) Is a eucaryotic microorganism including, but not limited to, 
protozoa, algae, and fungi;
    (2) Is a procaryotic microorganism, including, but not limited to, 
Eubacteria and Archaebacteria; or
    (3) Is a parasitically replicating microscopic element, including, 
but not limited to, viruses.
    (c) Applicability. (1) This part applies to microbial pesticides as 
specified in paragraphs (c)(2), (3) and (4) of this section.
    (2) Each new isolate of a microbial pesticide is treated as a new 
strain and must be registered independently of any similar registered 
microbial pesticide strain and supported by data required in this 
subpart.
    (3) Genetically modified microbial pesticides may be subject to 
additional data or information requirements on a case-by-case basis 
depending on the particular microbial agent and/or its parental strains, 
the proposed pesticide use pattern, and the manner and extent to which 
the organism has been genetically modified.
    (4) Pest control organisms such as insect predators, nematodes, and 
macroscopic parasites are exempt from the requirements of FIFRA as 
authorized by section 25(b) of FIFRA and specified in Sec. 152.20 (a) 
of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 158.2110  Microbial pesticides data requirements.

    (a) For all microbial pesticides. (1) The following Sec. 158.2120 
through Sec. 158.2150 identify the data requirements that are required 
to support registration of microbial pesticides. The variations in the 
test conditions are identified within the test notes.
    (2) Each data table includes ``use patterns'' under which the 
individual data are required, with variations including all use 
patterns, food and nonfood uses

[[Page 156]]

for terrestrial and aquatic applications, greenhouse, indoor, forestry, 
and residential outdoor applications under certain circumstances.
    (3) The categories for each data requirement are ``R,'' which stands 
for required, and ``CR'' which stands for conditionally required. If a 
bracket appears around the ``R'' or ``CR,'' the data are required for 
both the registration and experimental use permit requests. Generally, 
``R'' indicates that the data are more likely required than for those 
data requirements with ``CR.'' However, in each case, the regulatory 
text preceding the data table and the test notes following the data 
table must be used to determine whether the data requirement must be 
satisfied.
    (4) Each table identifies the test substance that is required to be 
tested to satisfy the data requirement. Test substances may include: 
technical grade active ingredient (TGAI), manufacturing-use product 
(MP), end-use product (EP), typical end-use product (TEP), residue of 
concern, and pure active ingredient (PAI) or all of the above (All). 
Commas between the test substances (i.e., TGAI, EP) indicate that data 
may be required on the TGAI or EP or both depending on the conditions 
set forth in the test note. Data requirements which list two test 
substances (i.e., TGAI and EP) indicate that both are required to be 
tested. Data requirements that list only MP as the test substance apply 
to products containing solely the technical grade of the active 
ingredient and manufacturing-use products to which other ingredients 
have been intentionally added. Data requirements listing the EP as the 
test substance apply to any EP with an ingredient in the end-use 
formulation other than the active ingredient that is expected to enhance 
the toxicity of the product.
    (b) Additional data requirements for genetically modified microbial 
pesticides. Additional requirements for genetically modified microbial 
pesticides may include but are not limited to: genetic engineering 
techniques used; the identity of the inserted or deleted gene segment 
(base sequence data or enzyme restriction map of the gene); information 
on the control region of the gene in question; a description of the 
``new'' traits or characteristics that are intended to be expressed; 
tests to evaluate genetic stability and exchange; and selected Tier II 
environmental expression and toxicology tests.

requirements for microbial pesticides product analysis as referenced in 
the last column of the table contained in paragraph (c) of this section.
    1. Required to support registration of each manufacturing-use 
product and end-use product. This analysis must be conducted at the 
point in the production process after which there would be no potential 
for microbial contamination or microbial regrowth. For full 
registration, generally an analysis of samples is a compilation of 
batches, over a period of time, depending on the frequency of 
manufacturing.
    2. Only required for emulsifiable liquid forms of microbial 
pesticides.
    3. Required when microbial pesticides are packaged in metal, 
plastic, or paper containers.
    4. Only required for liquid forms of microbial pesticides.

    (d) Test notes. The following test notes are applicable to the data 
requirements for microbial pesticides toxicology as referenced in the 
last column of the table contained in paragraph (c) of this section:
    1. The acute oral toxicity/pathogenicity study is required to 
support the TGAI. However, it can be combined with the unit dose portion 
of the acute oral toxicity study, with an EP or MP test material to 
fulfill the requirement for the TGAI and the MP or EP in a single study, 
if the new protocol is designed to address the endpoints of concern.
    2. Data not required for products whose active ingredient is a 
virus. For test materials whose size or consistency may prevent use of 
an intravenous injection, the intraperitoneal injection procedure may be 
employed.
    3. Hypersensitivity incidents, including immediate type and delayed-
type reactions of humans or domestic animals, occur during the testing 
or production of the TGAI, MP, or EP, or are otherwise known to the 
applicant must be reported if they occur.
    4. Data must be submitted only for products whose active ingredient 
is a virus.
    5. The 870 series studies for the MP and EP are intended to provide 
data on the acute toxicity of the product. Waivers for any or all of 
these studies may be granted when the applicant can demonstrate that the 
combination of inert ingredients is not likely to pose any significant 
human health risks. Where appropriate, the limit dose approach to 
testing is recommended.
    6. Required when the product consists of, or under conditions of use 
would result in, an inhalable material (e.g., gas, volatile substances, 
or aerosol particulate).
    7. Data required when significant toxicity, in the absence of 
pathogenicity and significant infectivity, is observed in acute oral, 
injection, or pulmonary studies (Tier I). Route(s) of exposure 
correspond to route(s) where toxicity was observed in Tier I studies. 
The toxic component of the TGAI is to be tested.
    8. Data required when significant infectivity and/or unusual 
persistence is observed in the absence of pathogenicity or toxicity in 
Tier I studies. Routes of exposure (oral and/or pulmonary) correspond to 
routes in Tier I studies where adverse effects were noted. Data may also 
be required to evaluate adverse effects due to microbial contaminants or 
to toxic byproducts.
    9. Data are required when one or more of the following criteria are 
met:
    i. Significant infectivity of the microbial pest control agent 
(MPCA) was observed in test animals in the Tier II subchronic study and 
in which no significant signs of toxicity or pathogenicity were 
observed.
    ii. The microbial pesticide is a virus which can persist or 
replicate in mammalian cell culture lines.
    iii. The microbial pesticide is not amenable to thorough taxonomic 
classification, and is related to organisms known to be parasitic for 
mammalian cells.
    iv. The microbial pesticide preparation is not well purified, and 
may contain contaminants which are parasitic for mammals.
    10. Data may be required for products known to contain or suspected 
to contain carcinogenic viruses or for microbial components that are 
identified as having significant toxicity in Tier II testing.
    11. Data may be required for products known to contain or suspected 
to contain viruses that can interact in an adverse manner with 
components of the mammalian immune system.
    12. An analysis of human infectivity/pathogenicity potential using 
scientific literature, genomic analysis, and/or actual specific cell 
culture/animal data may be required for products known to contain or 
suspected of containing intracellular parasites of mammalian cells for 
products that exhibit pathogenic characteristics in Tier I and/or Tier 
II, for products which are closely related to known human pathogens 
based on the product analysis data, or for known human pathogens that 
have been ``disarmed'' or rendered non-pathogenic for humans.
    13. Test standards may have to be modified depending on the 
characteristics of the microorganism. Requirements may vary for

[[Page 160]]

these studies depending on the active ingredient being tested. 
Consultation with the Agency is advised before performing these Tier III 
studies.

    (e) Test notes. The following test notes are applicable to the data 
requirements for microbial pesticides nontarget organism and 
environmental

[[Page 162]]

fate as referenced in the last column of the table contained in 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    1. Tests for pesticides intended solely for indoor application would 
be required on a case-by-case basis, depending on use pattern, 
production volume, and other pertinent factors.
    2. The preferred species for the avian oral study is either the 
upland game or waterfowl. The preferred species for the avian inhalation 
toxicity/pathogenicity study and the avian chronic toxicity/
pathogenicity study is the upland game. There is also the option to test 
the passerine if there is a concern. The coldwater fish is preferred for 
freshwater fish testing. However, two species (coldwater and warmwater 
fish species are the preferred species) must be tested for uses 
involving direct freshwater exposure. Freshwater invertebrate testing is 
also required.
    3. Data required when the nature of the microbial pesticide and/or 
its toxins indicates potential pathogenicity to birds.
    4. Required on a case-by-case basis if results of tests required by 
Sec. 158.2140 are inadequate or inappropriate for assessment of hazards 
to wild mammals.
    5. Required when there will be significant exposure to aquatic 
organisms (fish and invertebrates).
    6. Required if the product is intended for direct application into 
the estuarine or marine environment or expected to enter this 
environment in significant concentrations because of expected use or 
mobility pattern.
    7. Required if the microbial pesticide is taxonomically related to a 
known plant pathogen.
    8. Data are not required unless an active microbial ingredient 
controls the target insect pest by a mechanism of infectivity; i.e., may 
create an epizootic condition in nontarget insects.
    9. Required if toxic or pathogenic effects are observed in one or 
more of the following tests for microbial pesticides:
    i. Avian acute oral or avian inhalation studies.
    ii. Wild mammal studies.
    iii. Nontarget plant studies (terrestrial).
    iv. Honey bee studies.
    v. Nontarget insect studies.
    10. Required when toxic or pathogenic effects are observed in any of 
the following Tier I tests for microbial pest control agents:
    i. Freshwater fish studies.
    ii. Freshwater invertebrate studies.
    iii. Nontarget plant studies (aquatic).
    11. Required if product is applied on land or in fresh water or 
marine/estuarine environments and toxic or pathogenic effects are 
observed in any of the following Tier I tests for microbial pesticides:
    i. Estuarine and marine animal toxicity and pathogenicity.
    ii. Plant studies - estuarine or marine species.
    12. An appropriate dose-response toxicity test is required when 
toxic effects on nontarget terrestrial wildlife or aquatic organisms 
(including plants) are reported in one or more Tier I tests and results 
of Tier II tests indicate exposure of the microbial agent to the 
affected nontarget terrestrial wildlife or aquatic organisms. The 
protocols for these tests may have to be modified in accordance with 
results from the nontarget organism and environmental expression 
studies.
    13. Required when one or more of the following are present:
    i. Pathogenic effects are observed in Tier I avian studies.
    ii. Tier II environmental expression testing indicate that long-term 
exposure of terrestrial animals is likely.
    14. Required when product is intended for use in water or expected 
to be transported to water from the intended use site, and when 
pathogenicity or infectivity was observed in Tier I aquatic studies.
    15. Required if, after an analysis of the microbial pesticide's 
ability to survive and multiply in the environment and what ecological 
habitat it would occupy, the intended use patterns, and the results of 
previous nontarget organisms and environmental expression tests, it is 
determined that use of the microbial agent may result in adverse effects 
on the nontarget organisms in aquatic environments. Testing is to 
determine if applications of the microbial pest control would be 
expected to disrupt the balance of populations in the target ecosystem.
    16. Tier IV studies may be conducted as a condition of registration 
as post-registration monitoring if the potential for unreasonable 
adverse effects appears to be minimal during that period of use due to 
implementation of mitigation measures.
    17. Required when both of the following conditions occur:
    i. Pathogenic effects observed at actual or expected field residue 
exposure levels are reported in Tier III; and
    ii. The Agency determines that quarantine methods would not prevent 
the microbial pesticide from contaminating areas adjacent to the test 
area.
    18. Short term simulated or actual field studies are required when 
it is determined that the product is likely to cause adverse short-term 
or acute effects, based on consideration of available laboratory data, 
use patterns, and exposure rates.
    19. Data from a long-term simulated field test (e.g., where 
reproduction and growth of confined populations are observed) and/or an 
actual field test (e.g., where reproduction and growth of natural 
populations are observed) are required if laboratory data indicate that 
adverse long-term, cumulative, or

[[Page 163]]

life-cycle effects may result from intended use.
    20. Since test standards would be developed on a case-by-case basis, 
consultation with the Agency and development of a protocol is advised 
before performing these Tier IV studies.

Sec. 158.2160  Microbial pesticides product performance data requirements.

    Product performance data must be developed for all microbial 
pesticides. However, the Agency has waived all requirements to submit 
efficacy data unless the pesticide product bears a claim to control 
public health pests, such as pest microorganisms infectious to man in 
any area of the inanimate environment or a claim to control vertebrates 
(including but not limited to: rodents, birds, bats, canids, and skunks) 
or invertebrates (including but not limited to: mosquitoes and ticks) 
that may directly or indirectly transmit diseases to humans. However, 
each registrant must ensure through testing that his products are 
efficacious when used in accordance with label directions and commonly 
accepted pest control practices. The Agency reserves the right to 
require, on a case-by-case basis, submission of efficacy data for any 
pesticide product registered or proposed for registration.

    (d) Test notes. The following test notes are applicable to the data 
requirements for experimental use permit microbial pesticides product 
analysis as referenced in the last column of the table contained in 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    1. If an experimental use permit is being sought, and if the 
pesticide is not already under full-scale production, a schematic 
diagram and/or description of the manufacturing process suffices.
    2. If an experimental use permit is being sought, and if the product 
is not already under full-scale production, a discussion of 
unintentional ingredients is required to be submitted to the extent this 
information is available.
    3. Required to support registration of each manufacturing-use 
product and end-use product. This analysis must be conducted at the 
point in the production process after which there would be no potential 
for microbial contamination or microbial regrowth. For pesticides in the 
production stage, a preliminary product analytical method and data would 
suffice to support an experimental use permit. For full registration, 
generally an analysis of samples is a compilation of batches, over a 
period of time, depending on the frequency of manufacturing.
    4. Only required for emulsifiable liquid forms of microbial 
pesticides.
    5. Required when microbial pesticides are packaged in metal, 
plastic, or paper containers.
    6. Only required for liquid forms of microbial pesticides.

    (d) Test notes. The following test notes are applicable to the data 
requirements for experimental use permit microbial pesticides toxicology 
as referenced in the last column of the table contained in paragraph (c) 
of this section:
    1. The acute oral toxicity/pathogenicity study is required to 
support the TGAI. However, it can be combined with the unit dose portion 
of the acute oral toxicity study, with an EP or MP test material to 
fulfill the requirement for the TGAI and the MP or EP in a single study, 
if the new protocol is designed to address the endpoints of concern.
    2. Data not required for products whose active ingredient is a 
virus. For test materials whose size or consistency may prevent use of 
an intravenous injection, the intraperitoneal injection procedure may be 
employed.
    3. Hypersensitivity incidents, including immediate type and delayed 
type reactions of humans or domestic animals occur during the testing or 
production of the TGAI, MP, or EP, or are otherwise known to the 
applicant must be reported if they occur.
    4. Data must be submitted only for products whose active ingredient 
is a virus.
    5. The 870 series studies for the MP and EP are intended to provide 
data on the acute toxicity of the product. Waivers for any or all of 
these studies may be granted when the applicant can demonstrate that the 
combination of inert ingredients is not likely to pose any significant 
human health risks. Where appropriate, the limit dose approach to 
testing is recommended.
    6. Required when the product consists of, or under conditions of use 
that would result in an inhalable material (e.g., gas, volatile 
substances, or aerosol particulate).

    (e) Test notes. The following test notes are applicable to the data 
requirements for microbial pesticides nontarget organism and 
environmental fate as referenced in the last column of the table 
contained in paragraph (d) of this section.
    1. Tests for pesticides intended solely for indoor application would 
be required on a case-by-case basis, depending on use pattern, 
production volume, and other pertinent factors. Tests to support EUP's 
are based on the application timing and acreage.
    2. The preferred species for the avian oral study is either the 
upland game or waterfowl. The preferred species for the avian inhalation 
toxicity/pathogenicity study and the avian chronic toxicity/
pathogenicity study is the upland game. There is also the option to test 
a passerine species if there is a concern. The coldwater fish is 
preferred for freshwater fish testing. However, two species (coldwater 
and warmwater fish are the preferred species) must be tested for uses 
involving direct freshwater exposure. Freshwater invertebrates are 
preferred for invertebrate testing.
    3. Required when there will be significant exposure to aquatic 
organisms (fish and invertebrates).
    4. Required if the microbial pesticide is taxonomically related to a 
known plant pathogen.
    5. Data are not required unless an active microbial ingredient 
controls the target insect pest by a mechanism of infectivity; i.e., may 
create an epizootic condition in nontarget insects.

Sec. 159.152  What the law requires of registrants.

    (a) Section 6(a)(2) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and 
Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) states: ``If at any time after the registration 
of a pesticide the registrant has additional factual information 
regarding unreasonable adverse effects on the environment of the 
pesticide, he shall submit such information to the Administrator.''
    (b) Section 152.50(f)(3) of this chapter requires applicants to 
submit, as part of an application for registration, any factual 
information of which he is aware regarding unreasonable adverse effects 
of the pesticide on humans or the environment, which would be required 
to be reported under section 6(a)(2) if the product were registered.
    (c) Compliance with this part will satisfy a registrant's 
obligations to submit additional information pursuant to section 6(a)(2) 
and will satisfy an applicant's obligation to submit additional 
information pursuant to Sec. 152.50(f)(3) of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 159.153  Definitions.

    (a) For the purposes of reporting information pursuant to FIFRA 
section 6(a)(2), the definitions set forth in FIFRA section 2 and in 40 
CFR part 152 apply to this part unless superseded by a definition in 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) For purposes of reporting information pursuant to FIFRA section 
6(a)(2), the following definitions apply only to this subpart:
    Established level means a tolerance, temporary tolerance, food 
additive regulation, action level, or other limitation on pesticide 
residues imposed by law, regulation, or other authority.
    Formal Review means Special Review, Rebuttable Presumption Against 
Registration (RPAR), FIFRA section 6(c) suspension proceeding, or FIFRA 
section 6(b) cancellation proceeding, whether completed or not.
    Hospitalization means admission for treatment to a hospital, clinic 
or other health care facility. Treatment as an out-patient is not 
considered to be hospitalization.
    Maximum contaminant level (MCL) means the maximum permissible level, 
established by EPA, for a contaminant in water which is delivered to any 
user of a public water system.
    Non-target organism means any organism for which pesticidal control 
was either not intended or not legally permitted by application of a 
pesticide.
    Pesticide means a pesticide product which is or was registered by 
EPA, and each active ingredient, inert ingredient, impurity, metabolite, 
contaminant or degradate contained in, or derived from, such pesticide 
product.
    Qualified expert means one who, by virtue of his or her knowledge, 
skill, experience, training, or education, could be qualified by a court 
as an expert to testify on issues related to the subject matter on which 
he or she renders a conclusion or opinion. Under Rule 702 of the Federal 
Rules of Evidence, a person may be qualified as an expert on a 
particular matter by virtue of ``knowledge, skill, experience, training, 
or education.'' In general, EPA wants registrants to report information 
when a person has relevant expert credentials, e.g., a medical doctor 
giving a medical opinion, a plant pathologist giving an opinion on plant 
pathology, etc.
    Registrant includes any person who holds, or ever held, a 
registration for a pesticide product issued under FIFRA section 3 or 
24(c).
    Similar species means two or more species belonging to the same 
general taxonomic groups: The general taxonomic groups for purposes of 
this requirement are: mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, 
aquatic invertebrates, insects, arachnids, aquatic plants (including 
macrophyte, floating, and submerged plants), and terrestrial (all non-
aquatic) plants.
    Water reference level means the level specified in paragraph (1) or 
(2) of this definition, whichever is lower.
    (1) Ten percent of the maximum contaminant level (MCL) established 
by EPA, or if no MCL has been established by EPA, 10 percent of the most 
recent

[[Page 169]]

draft or final long-term health advisory level (HAL) established by EPA, 
or if EPA has not published or proposed an MCL or HAL, the lowest 
detectable amount of the pesticide.
    (2) The ambient water quality criteria for the protection of aquatic 
life, established by EPA pursuant to section 304(a) of the Clean Water 
Act.

set forth in Sec. 159.184(d).
    (c) EPA may, in its discretion, notify a registrant in writing of a 
different reporting period that will apply to specific types of 
reportable information or eliminate reporting requirements entirely. 
Such notification supersedes otherwise applicable reporting requirements 
set forth in this part.
    (d) For purposes of this part, a registrant possesses or knows of 
information at the time any officer, employee, agent, or other person 
acting for the registrant first comes into possession of, or knows of, 
such information; provided that, such person performs any activities for 
the registrant related to the development, testing, sale or registration 
of a pesticide or the person could be reasonably expected to come into 
possession of information otherwise reportable under this part. In the 
case of information known to or possessed by an agent or other person 
acting for the registrant, a registrant is responsible for such 
information only if the agent or other person acquired such information 
while acting for the registrant.

a person who meets any of the following:
    (1) Who was employed or retained (directly or indirectly) by the 
registrant, and was likely to receive such information.
    (2) From whom the registrant requested the opinion(s) or 
conclusion(s) in question.
    (3) Who is a qualified expert as described in Sec. 159.153(b).
    (b) Exceptions--(1) Clearly erroneous information. Information need 
not be submitted if before that date on which the registrant must submit 
such information if all of the following conditions are met:
    (i) The registrant discovers that any analysis, conclusion, or 
opinion was predicated on data that were erroneously generated, 
recorded, or transmitted, or on computational errors.
    (ii) Every author of each such analysis, conclusion, or opinion, or 
as many authors as can be contacted through the use of reasonable 
diligence, has acknowledged in writing that the analysis, conclusion, or 
opinion was improper and has either corrected the original analysis, 
conclusion, or opinion accordingly, or provided an explanation as to why 
it cannot be corrected.
    (iii) As a result of the correction, the information is no longer 
required to be reported under FIFRA section 6(a)(2), or if no correction 
was possible, the authors agree that the original analysis, conclusion 
or opinion has no scientific validity.
    (2) Previously submitted information. Information regarding an 
incident, study, or other occurrence need not be submitted if before the 
date on which the registrant must submit such information, the

in a recognized database of scientific and medical literature, such as 
Medline, ENBASE, Toxline or Index Medicus, if the abstract in question 
clearly identified the active ingredient or the registered pesticide(s) 
to which the information pertains. Otherwise reportable information 
received by or known to the registrant prior to publication of an 
abstract concerning the information must be reported and may not be 
withheld pending such publication.
    (ii) Reports or publications which have been made available to the 
public by any of the following Federal agencies: Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, Consumer Products Safety Commission, Department 
of Agriculture, Department of the Interior, Food and Drug Administration 
or any other agency or institute affiliated with the Department of 
Health and Human Services. Otherwise reportable information concerning 
research which was performed, sponsored, or funded by the registrant 
which may also appear in forthcoming Government reports or publications 
must be reported and may not be withheld pending publication.
    (4) Information concerning former inerts, contaminants or 
impurities. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this part, a 
registrant need not report information concerning a chemical compound 
that was at one time an inert ingredient or a contaminant or impurity of 
a pesticide product, and would otherwise be reportable under this part,

Sec. 159.160  Obligations of former registrants.

    (a) General. A former registrant is obliged to continue to submit 
information concerning the registration of a pesticide product 
previously held by the registrant and otherwise reportable under the 
provisions of this part for a period of 5 years after the registration 
of the pesticide product has been canceled or transferred to another 
registrant, with the exceptions provided by paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (b) Exceptions. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of 
this section, a former registrant is not obligated to report information 
pursuant to this part if any of the following conditions are applicable:
    (1) The information is first obtained by the person more than 1 year 
after the date on which the person ceased to hold the registration of 
the product to which the information pertains, and the person holds no 
active pesticide registrations, or for some other reason cannot 
reasonably be expected to receive information concerning the formerly 
registered product.
    (2) The information is associated solely with an inert ingredient, 
contaminant, impurity, metabolite, or degradate contained in a product, 
and the information is first obtained by the person more than 1 year 
after the date upon which the person ceased to hold the registration of 
the product.
    (3) The information is associated with an active ingredient or a 
formerly registered product, and the active ingredient or every active 
ingredient contained in the formerly registered product has not been 
contained in any pesticide product registered in the United States for 
any part of the 3-year period preceding the date on which the person 
first obtained the information.
    (4) The information pertains solely to a formerly registered product 
that no longer meets the definition of ``pesticide'' in section 2(u) of 
FIFRA.
    (c) Information arising from litigation. Notwithstanding any other 
provisions of this section, a former registrant is obliged to submit 
information otherwise reportable under this part concerning formerly-
registered pesticide products which arises in the course of litigation 
concerning the effects of such products, regardless of when the 
information is first acquired, provided that neither of the provisions 
of paragraphs (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section are met. Such information 
shall be submitted in the same manner and according to the same 
schedules as it would have to be submitted by a current registrant of a 
pesticide product to which the information pertained.

    Adverse effects information must be submitted as follows:
    (a) Toxicological studies. (1) The results of a study of the 
toxicity of a pesticide to humans or other non-target domestic organisms 
if, relative to all previously submitted studies, they show an adverse 
effect under any of the following conditions:
    (i) That is in a different organ or tissue of the test organism.
    (ii) At a lower dosage, or after a shorter exposure period, or after 
a shorter latency period.
    (iii) At a higher incidence or frequency.

organism.
    (v) By a different route of exposure.
    (2) Acute oral, acute dermal, acute inhalation or skin and eye 
irritation studies in which the only change in toxicity is a numerical 
decrease in the median lethal dose (LD<INF>50</INF>), median lethal 
concentration (LC<INF>50</INF>) or irritation indices, are not 
reportable under this part unless the results indicate a more 
restrictive toxicity category for labeling under the criteria of 40 CFR 
156.62.
    (b) Ecological studies. The results of a study of the toxicity of a 
pesticide to terrestrial or aquatic wildlife or plants if, relative to 
all previously submitted studies, they show an adverse effect under any 
of the following conditions:
    (1) At levels 50 percent or more lower than previous acute toxicity 
studies with similar species, including determinations of the median 
lethal dose (LD<INF>50</INF>), median lethal concentration 
(LC<INF>50</INF>), or median effective concentration (EC<INF>50</INF>).

[[Page 173]]

    (2) At lower levels in a chronic study than previous studies with 
similar species.
    (3) In a study with a previously untested species the results 
indicate the chronic no observed effect level (NOEL) is 10 percent or 
less of the lowest LC<INF>50</INF> or LD<INF>50</INF> for a similar 
species.
    (4) For plants when tested at the maximum label application rate or 
less, if either of the following conditions is met:
    (i) More than 25 percent of terrestrial plants show adverse effects 
on plant life cycle functions and growth such as germination, emergence, 
plant vigor, reproduction and yields.
    (ii) More than 50 percent of aquatic plants show adverse effects on 
plant life cycle functions and growth such as germination, emergence, 
plant vigor, reproduction and yields.
    (c) Results from a study that demonstrates any toxic effect (even if 
corroborative of information already known to the Agency), must be 
submitted if the pesticide is or has been the subject of a Formal Review 
based on that effect within 5 years of the time the results are 
received. Within 30 calendar days of the publication of a Notice of 
Commencement of a Formal Review in the Federal Register, all information 
which has become reportable due to the commencement of the Formal Review 
must be submitted.
    (d) Incomplete studies. Information from an incomplete study of the 
toxicity to any organism of a registered pesticide product or any of its 
ingredients, impurities, metabolites, or degradation products which 
would otherwise be reportable under paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of this 
section must be submitted if the information meets any one of the 
folowing three sets of criteria:
    (1) Short-term studies. A study using a test regimen lasting 90 
calendar days or less, and all of the following conditions are met:
    (i) All testing has been completed.
    (ii) A preliminary data analysis or gross pathological analysis has 
been conducted.
    (iii) Final analysis has not been completed.
    (iv) A reasonable period for completion of the final analysis not 
longer than 90 calendar days following completion of testing has 
elapsed.
    (v) Comparable information concerning the results of a completed 
study would be reportable.
    (2) Long-term studies. A study using a test regimen lasting more 
than 90 calendar days, and all of the following conditions are met:
    (i) All testing has been completed.
    (ii) A preliminary data analysis or gross pathological analysis has 
been conducted.
    (iii) Final analysis has not been completed.
    (iv) A reasonable period of completion of final analysis (not longer 
that 1 year following completion of testing) has elapsed.
    (v) Comparable information concerning the results of a completed 
study would be reportable.
    (3) Serious adverse effects. Any study in which testing or analysis 
of results is not yet complete but in which serious adverse effects have 
already been observed which may reasonably be attributed to exposure to 
the substances tested, because the effects observed in exposed organisms 
differ from effects observed in control organisms, are atypical in view 
of historical experience with the organism tested, or otherwise support 
a reasonable inference of causation, and 30 days have passed from the 
date the registrant first has the information.

established levels, except that information on excess residues resulting 
solely from studies conducted under authority of FIFRA section 5 or 
under other controlled research studies conducted to test a pesticide 
product need not be submitted, provided that the treated crop is not 
marketed as a food or feed commodity. The information to be submitted is 
the same as that required in Sec. 159.184(c)(1), (2), (3), and 
(4)(iv)(E), (F), (G), and (H).

resulting in those waters from legal applications of the pesticide.
    (4) Information need not be submitted concerning detections of 
pesticides in waters of the United States, ground water or finished 
drinking water if the substance detected is an inert ingredient, or a 
metabolite, degradate, contaminant or impurity of a pesticide product, 
unless EPA has established or proposed a maximum contaminant level (MCL) 
or health advisory level (HAL) for that substance, or has estimated a 
health advisory level based on an established reference dose (RfD) for 
that substance, and notified registrants of that level.
    (5) Information to be submitted is the same as that required in 
Sec. 159.184(c)(1), (2), (3), (4)(iv) and (v), and (5)(vi).

Sec. 159.184  Toxic or adverse effect incident reports.

    (a) General. Information about incidents affecting humans or other 
non-target organisms must be submitted if the following three conditions 
are met:
    (1) The registrant is aware, or has been informed that a person or 
non-target organism may have been exposed to a pesticide.
    (2) The registrant is aware, or has been informed that the person or 
non-target organism suffered a toxic or adverse effect, or may suffer a 
delayed or chronic adverse effect in the future.
    (3) The registrant has or could obtain information concerning where 
the incident occurred, the pesticide or product involved, and the name 
of a person to contact regarding the incident.
    (b) Exceptions. Information regarding an incident need not be 
submitted if any of the following conditions are met:
    (1) The registrant is aware of facts which clearly establish that 
the reported toxic effect, or reported exposure, did not or will not 
occur.
    (2) The registrant has been notified in writing by the Agency that 
the reporting requirement has been waived for this incident or category 
of incidents, and the registrant has not been notified in writing by the 
Agency that the waiver is rescinded.
    (3) It concerns a toxic effect to non-target plants, which were at 
the use site at the time the pesticide was applied, if the label 
provides adequate notice of such a risk.
    (4) It concerns non-lethal phytotoxicity to the treated crop if the 
label provides an adequate notice of such a risk.
    (5) It concerns a toxic effect to pests not specified on the label, 
provided that such pests are similar to pests specified on the label.
    (6) It concerns minor skin or eye irritation effects warned of on 
the label of a product which is registered for use in residential use 
sites, and the effects occurred as a result of use in a residential 
site.
    (c) Required information on individual incidents. To the extent that 
the registrant has any of the information listed in paragraphs (c)(1) 
through (c)(4) of this section, the registrant must supply the 
information on each pesticide incident that meets the requirements 
outlined in paragraph (a) of this section. If the registrant acquires 
additional information concerning an incident previously reported to the 
Agency under this part, such information shall be reported if it meets 
the criteria set forth in paragraph (f) of this section. In the future, 
the Agency may by notice specify a format for such submissions. The 
Administrative, Pesticide, Circumstance and Exposure Type(s) of 
information must be reported for individual incidents, except where the 
provisions of paragraph (e) of this section allow for aggregated summary 
forms of reporting, or if EPA in the future grants permission in writing 
for alternative reporting formats. The registrant must also provide one 
or more Exposure Type and Severity categories and their designations for 
each incident as set forth in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, 
depending on the applicability of the criteria listed below. The

[[Page 176]]

criteria listed should be used in assigning a category. For example, an 
incident which allegedly caused serious but non-fatal effects to human 
beings and domestic animals might be designated ``H-B: D-B.'' When a 
single incident involves multiple pesticides, the registrant need only 
report on their specific product. However, if a single incident involves 
more than one type of non-target organism--for example, both humans and 
domestic animals are involved--all appropriate available information 
dealing with each of the victims must also be reported. The 
informational items below are grouped by sections for ease in reporting 
pesticide incidents.
    (1) Administrative. Pesticide incident reports must be submitted if 
the registrant possesses or receives any of the following information, 
and the incident meets the minimum requirements set forth in paragraph

[[Page 194]]


<R05>
Sec. 161.20  Overview.

    (a) Legal authority. These requirements are promulgated under the 
authority of sections 3, 5, 12, and 25 of the Federal Insecticide, 
Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, as amended (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136-136y).
    (b) Purposes of this part. (1) The primary purpose of this part is 
to specify the types and minimum amounts of data and information the 
Agency requires in order to make regulatory judgments about the risks 
and benefits of various kinds of pesticide products under the criteria 
set forth in FIFRA sections 3(c)(5) (C) and (D) and 3(c)(7).
    (2) This part also specifies the types and minimum amounts of data 
and information the Agency requires to decide whether to approve 
applications for experimental use permits under FIFRA section 5.
    (3) Finally, this part specifies the types and minimum amounts of 
data and information that an applicant for registration, amended 
registration, or reregistration must submit or cite in support of an 
application in order to satisfy the requirements of FIFRA section 
3(c)(1)(D) and sections 3(c)(5)(B) or 3(c)(7). Use of the term 
``registration'' in this part will pertain to new registrations and 
amended registrations as well as reregistration accomplished under 
section 3(g), unless stated otherwise.
    (c) Availability of related guidelines. The data requirements for 
pesticide registration specified in this part pertain to product 
chemistry, residue chemistry, environmental fate, toxicology, reentry 
protection, aerial drift evaluation, wildlife and aquatic organisms, 
plant protection, nontarget insects, product performance, and 
biochemical and microbial pesticides. The standards for conducting 
acceptable tests, guidance on evaluation and reporting of data, further 
guidance on when data are required, definition of most terms, and 
examples of protocols are not specified in this part. This information 
is available in advisory documents (collectively referred to as 
Pesticide Assessment Guidelines) through the National Technical 
Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161 
(telephone: 703-487-4650).


<R05>
Sec. 161.25  Applicability of data requirements.

    (a) Some kinds of data and information are specified in subparts C 
and D of this part as ``required'' (``R'') for the evaluation of some or 
all types of products. Other kinds of data and information are specified 
in those sections as ``conditionally required'' (``CR''), that is, they 
are required if the product's proposed pattern of use, results of other 
tests, or other pertinent factors meet the criteria specified in those 
sections. The terms ``required'' and ``conditionally required'' are 
further discussed in Sec. Sec. 161.100 and 161.101.
    (b) The Agency recognizes that certain data requirements may not be 
applicable to (or should be waived for) some products, and has made 
provisions for such cases in this part as specified in Sec. 161.35 
Flexibility of the data requirements, Sec. 161.40 Consultation with the 
Agency, Sec. 161.45 Waivers, and Sec. 161.60 Minor uses.

[49 FR 42881, Oct. 24, 1984, as amended at 53 FR 15999, May 4, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 161.30  Timing of the imposition of data requirements.

    This part establishes requirements for the types of data which are 
necessary to support the unconditional registration of a pesticide 
product under section 3(c)(5) of the Act. While every registered 
pesticide product must eventually be supported by the data required by 
part 161, when an applicant or registrant must initially satisfy these 
data requirements depends on the factors listed below in this section.
    (a) Existing Registrations. A registrant of a currently registered 
pesticide product is not obligated to satisfy any data requirement in 
part 161 with respect to that product until he receives a notice under 
section 3(c)(2)(B) of the Act that additional data are required to 
support the continued registration of the product, until he applies for 
an amendment to the registration, or until the product is subject to 
reregistration.
    (b) Applications. The amount of data required by the Agency to 
evaluate an application for initial or amended registration depends on 
whether the product is being reviewed under section

[[Page 195]]

3(c)(5) of the Act (unconditional registration) or section 3(c)(7) of 
the Act (conditional registration). Refer to Sec. 152.111 of this 
chapter or consult with the appropriate EPA Product Manager to determine 
under which section of the Act the application will be reviewed. The 
following paragraphs identify, for each different type of application, 
the minimum amount of data that must be available for EPA review to 
permit EPA to make the statutory risk-benefit determinations required by 
section 3(c)(5) or 3(c)(7) of the Act. In addition to satisfying these 
minimum data requirements, applicants may be required to submit or cite 
additional data, either to permit EPA to assess the safety or efficacy 
of the product (refer to Sec. 161.75) or to comply with the statutory 
requirements of section 3(c)(1)(D) of the Act, or both.
    (1) Applications for unconditional registration under section 
3(c)(5) of the Act. EPA will not approve an application for 
unconditional registration unless all data required by this part which 
have not been waived are available for EPA to review.
    (2) Applications for conditional registration of a new chemical 
under section 3(c)(7)(C) of the Act. EPA will not approve an application 
for conditional registration of a pesticide containing an active 
ingredient not contained in any currently registered product unless data 
required by this part are available for EPA to review except for:
    (i) Those data for which the requirement has been waived.
    (ii) Those data for which the requirement was imposed so recently 
that the applicant has not had sufficient time to produce the data.
    (3) Applications for conditional registration of products which are 
identical or substantially similar to currently registered products 
under section 3(c)(7)(A) of the Act. EPA will not approve an application 
for conditional registration of a pecticide product which is identical 
or substantially similar to a currently registered pesticide unless the 
following data are available for EPA to review:
    (i) Product chemistry data, as required by subpart C of this part.
    (ii) Product performance data, to the extent required by Sec. 
161.160.
    (4) Applications for conditional registration of new uses of 
currently registered products under section 3(c)(7)(B) of the Act. EPA 
will not approve an application for registration of a pesticide for a 
new use of a currently registered pesticide product unless the following 
data are available for EPA to review:
    (i) Product chemistry data, as required by subpart C of this part.
    (ii) Product performance data, to the extent required by Sec. 
161.160.
    (iii) Other data pertaining solely to the new use. The applicant may 
generally determine which data pertain solely to the new use by 
comparing the data requirements for all existing uses of all currently 
registered products containing the same active ingredient(s) with those 
for all uses including the new use. Any differences are attributable to 
the new use and must be submitted with the application.

[49 FR 42881, Oct. 24, 1984, as amended at 53 FR 15999, May 4, 1988; 58 
FR 34203, June 23, 1993]

Sec. 161.33  Procedures for claims of confidentiality of data.

    (a) General. A data submitter must clearly identify any information 
which he claims is entitled to confidential treatment under FIFRA sec. 
10. The procedures in this section must be followed to assert a claim of 
confidentiality.
    (b) Claims of confidentiality for information described by FIFRA 
sec. 10(d)(1) (A), (B), and (C). Any information claimed to be 
confidential under FIFRA sec. 10(d)(1) (A) through (C) must be submitted 
in accordance with the following procedures:
    (1) The information must be contained in a separate attachment to 
the study. If any information is included in the body of the study 
rather than in

[[Page 197]]

the confidential attachment, the submitter waives a claim of 
confidentiality for such information under FIFRA sec. 10(d)(1) (A), (B), 
or (C).
    (2) The attachment must have a cover page which is clearly marked to 
indicate that the material contained in the attachment falls within the 
scope of FIFRA sec. 10(d)(1) (A), (B), or (C).
    (3) Each item in the attachment must be numbered. For each item, the 
submitter must cite the applicable portion of FIFRA sec. 10(d)(1) (A), 
(B), or (C) on which the claim of confidentiality is based. In addition, 
for each item, the submitter must provide a list of page numbers in the 
study where the item is cited (i.e., identified by number).
    (4) Each item in the attachment must be referenced in the body of 
the study by its number in the attachment.
    (5) The following statement must appear on the Statement of Data 
Confidentiality Claims:

    Information claimed confidential on the basis of its falling within 
the scope of FIFRA sec. 10(d)(1)(A), (B), or (C) has been removed to a 
confidential appendix, and is cited by cross-reference number in the 
body of the study.


The statement must bear the name, title, and signature of the submitter 
or his properly designated agent, and the date of signature.
    (c) No claim of confidentiality under FIFRA sec. 10(d)(1)(A), (B), 
or (C). If no claim of confidentiality is being made for information 
described by FIFRA sec. 10(d)(1)(A), (B), or (C), or if such information 
is not contained in the body of the study, the Statement of Data 
Confidentiality Claims must include the following statement:

    No claim of confidentiality is made for any information contained in 
this study on the basis of its falling within the scope of FIFRA sec. 
10(d)(1)(A), (B), or (C).


This statement must bear the name, title and signature of the submitter 
or his properly designated agent, and the date of signature.
    (d) Claim of confidentiality for information not described by FIFRA

Sec. 161.35  Flexibility of the data requirements.

    Several provisions of this part provide EPA flexibility in requiring 
(or not requiring) data and information for the purposes specified in 
Sec. 161.20(b). These provisions are summarized in this section and 
discussed elsewhere in this part.
    (a) The Agency encourages each applicant, particularly a person 
applying for registration for the first time, to consult with the 
Product Manager for

[[Page 199]]

his product to resolve questions relating to the protocols or the data 
requirements before undertaking extensive testing under Sec. 161.40.
    (b) Any applicant who believes that a data requirement is 
inapplicable to a specific pesticide product may request a waiver of a 
data requirement under Sec. 161.45.
    (c) The Agency may require an applicant to provide additional data 
or information beyond that specified in subparts C and D of this part 
when these data are not sufficient to permit EPA to evaluate the 
applicant's product under Sec. 161.75.
    (d) Several policies are in effect that govern the data requirements 
for registration of products having minor uses. These policies reduce 
substantially the data requirements that need to be met on the basis of 
limited exposures and economic equity, and allow case-by-case decision 
making to determine the specific needs for each kind of use under Sec. 
161.60.
    (e) The data requirements and guidelines are not static documents. 
Section 3(c)(2) of FIFRA states that the administrator ``shall revise 
such guidelines from time to time.'' Therefore, the data requirements 
and guidelines will be revised periodically to reflect new scientific 
knowledge, new trends in pesticide development, and new Agency policies 
under Sec. 161.80.

[49 FR 42881, Oct. 24, 1984, as amended at 53 FR 15999, May 4, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 161.40  Consultation with the Agency.

    This part establishes data requirements applicable to various 
general use patterns of pesticide products, but some unique or 
unanticipated aspect of a proposed product's use pattern or composition 
may result in the need for conferences between registration applicants 
and the Agency. Such conferences may be initiated by the Agency or by 
registration applicants. Applicants are expected to contact their 
respective Product Managers to arrange discussions. The Agency welcomes 
suggestions for changes to improve the clarity, accuracy, or some other 
aspect of the data requirements set forth in this part. Specific 
suggestions should be forwarded to the Director of the Hazard Evaluation 
Division.


<R05>
Sec. 161.45  Waivers.

    (a) Rationale and policy. (1) The data requirements specified in 
this part as applicable to a category of products will not always be 
appropriate for every product in that category. Some products may have 
unusual physical, chemical, or biological properties or atypical use 
patterns which would make particular data requirements inappropriate, 
either because it would not be possible to generate the required data or 
because the data would not be useful in the Agency's evaluation of the 
risks or benefits of the product. The Agency will waive data 
requirements it finds are inappropriate, but will ensure that sufficient 
data are available to make the determinations required by the applicable 
statutory standards.
    (2) The Agency will waive data requirements on a case-by-case basis 
in response to specific written requests by applicants. Because of the 
wide variety of types and use patterns of pesticides, it is impossible 
to spell out all of the circumstances which might serve as a basis for 
waiving data requirements. The Agency, however, will take into account, 
as appropriate, the factors enumerated in sections 3(c)(2)(A) and 
25(a)(1) of FIFRA.
    (b) Procedure for requesting waiver. (1) An applicant should discuss 
his plans to request a waiver with the EPA Product Manager responsible 
for his product before developing and submitting extensive support 
information for the request.
    (2) To request a waiver, an applicant must submit a written request 
to the appropriate Product Manager. The request must specifically 
identify the data requirement for which a waiver is requested, explain 
why he thinks data requirement(s) should be waived, describe any 
unsuccessful attempts to generate the required data, furnish any other 
information which he believes would support the request, and when 
appropriate, suggest alternative means of obtaining data to address the 
concern which underlies the data requirement.
    (c) Notification of waiver decision. The Agency will review each 
waiver request and inform the applicant in writing of its decision. In 
addition, for decisions

[[Page 200]]

that could apply to more than a specific product, the Agency may choose 
to send a notice to all registrants or to publish a notice in the 
Federal Register announcing its decision. An Agency decision denying a 
written request to waive a data requirement shall constitute final 
Agency action for purposes of FIFRA section 16(a).
    (d) Availability of waiver decisions. Agency decisions under this 
section granting waiver requests will be available to the public at the 
OPP Regulatory Public Docket located as set forth in 40 CFR 150.17(c). 
Any person may obtain a copy of any waiver decision by written request 
in the manner set forth in 40 CFR part 2.

Sec. 161.55  Agricultural vs. non-agricultural pesticides.

    Section 25(a)(1) of FIFRA instructs the Administrator to ``take into 
account the difference in concept and usage between various classes of 
pesticides and differences in environmental risk and the appropriate 
data for evaluating such risk between agricultural and non-agricultural 
pesticides.'' This part distinguishes the various classes of pesticide 
use (e.g., crop vs. non-crop) and the corresponding data necessary to 
support registration under FIFRA. This information is present in each 
data requirement table. In addition, the Use Pattern Index (appendix A) 
is a comprehensive list of pesticide use patterns, cross-referenced to 
the general use patterns appearing in the tables; the index will further 
assist the reader in distinguishing agricultural versus non-agricultural 
uses of pesticides.

[49 FR 42881, Oct. 24, 1984, as amended at 53 FR 15999, May 4, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 161.60  Minor uses.

    (a) Minor use policy. A minor use of a pesticide is a use on a 
``minor crop'' (a crop which is planted on a small total amount of 
acreage) or a use which is otherwise limited such that the potential 
market volume of the product for that use is inherently small. EPA's 
policy concerning data requirements for minor uses of pesticides 
includes the following elements:
    (1) Since the market volume for a minor use of a pesticide is 
intrinsically low, and the risk associated with the use often is also 
correspondingly low, EPA will adjust the data requirements concerning 
the minor use appropriately.
    (2) A new data requirement pertinent to both an unregistered minor 
use and a registered major use will not be applied to a minor use 
applicant until it is applied to the major use registrations.
    (3) EPA will accept extrapolations and regional data to support 
establishment of individual minor use tolerances.
    (4) Group tolerances will be established to assist applicants for 
registration of products for minor uses as described in 40 CFR 180.34.
    (b) Advice on data requirements to support minor uses. Applicants 
for registration are advised to contact the appropriate EPA Product 
Manager of the Minor Use Officer for advice on developing data to 
support new applications for minor uses of pesticides.


<R05>
Sec. 161.70  Acceptable protocols.

    The Agency has published Pesticide Assessment Guidelines, as 
indicated in Sec. 161.20(d), which contain suggested protocols for 
conducting tests to develop the data required by this part.
    (a) General policy. Any appropriate protocol may be used provided 
that it meets the purpose of the test standards specified in the 
guidelines and provides data of suitable quality and completeness as 
typified by the protocols cited in the guidelines. Applicants should use 
the test procedure which is most suitable for evaluation of the 
particular ingredient, mixture, or product. Accordingly, failure to 
follow a suggested protocol will not invalidate a test if another 
appropriate methodology is used.
    (b) Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 
Protocols. Tests conducted in accordance with the requirements and 
recommendations of the applicable OECD protocols can be used to develop 
data necessary to meet the requirements specified in this part.

[[Page 201]]

Readers should note, however, that certain of the OECD recommended test 
standards, such as test duration and selection of test species, are less 
restrictive than those recommended by EPA. Therefore, when using the 
OECD protocols, care should be taken to observe the test standards in a 
manner such that the data generated by the study will satisfy the 
requirements of this part.
    (c) Procedures for requesting advice on protocols. Normally, all 
contact between the Agency and applicants or registrants is handled by 
the assigned Product Manager in the Registration Division of the Office 
of Pesticide Programs. Accordingly, questions concerning protocols 
should be directed, preferably in writing, to the Product Manager 
responsible for the registration or application which would be affected.


<R05>
Sec. 161.75  Requirements for additional data.

    (a) General policy. The data routinely required by part 161 may not 
be sufficient to permit EPA to evaluate every pesticide product. If the 
information required under this part is not sufficient to evaluate the 
potential of the product to cause unreasonable adverse effects on man or 
the environment, additional data requirements will be imposed. However, 
EPA expects that the information required by this part will be adequate 
in most cases for an assessment of the properties of pesticide.
    (b) Policy on test substance. In general, where the technical grade 
of the active ingredient is specified as the substance to be tested, 
tests may be performed using a technical grade which is substantially 
similar to the technical grade used in the product for which 
registration is sought. In addition to or in lieu of the testing 
required in subparts C and D of this part the Administrator will, on a 
case-by-case basis, require testing to be conducted with:
    (1) An analytical pure grade of an active ingredient, with or 
without radioactive tagging.
    (2) The technical grade of an active ingredient.
    (3) The representative technical grade of an active ingredient.
    (4) An intentionally added inert ingredient in a pesticide product.
    (5) A contaminant or impurity of an active or inert ingredient.
    (6) A plant or animal metabolite or degradation product of an active 
or inert ingredient.
    (7) The end-use pesticide product.
    (8) The end-use pesticide product plus any recommended vehicles and 
adjuvants.
    (9) Any additional substance which could act as a synergist to the 
product for which registration is sought.
    (10) Any combination of substances in paragraphs (b) (1) through (9) 
of this section.

[49 FR 42881, Oct. 24, 1984, as amended at 53 FR 15999, May 4, 1988; 58 
FR 34203, June 23, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 161.80  Acceptability of data.

    (a) General policy. The Agency will determine whether the data 
submitted to fulfill the data requirements specified in this part are 
acceptable. This determination will be based on the design and conduct 
of the experiment from which the data were derived, and an evaluation of 
whether the data fulfill the purpose(s) of the data requirement. In 
evaluating experimental design, the Agency will consider whether 
generally accepted methods were used, sufficient numbers of measurements 
were made to achieve statistical reliability, and sufficient controls 
were built into all phases of the experiment. The Agency will evaluate 
the conduct of each experiment in terms of whether the study was 
conducted in conformance with the design, good laboratory practices were 
observed, and results were reproducible. The Agency will not reject data 
merely because they were derived from studies which, when initiated were 
in accordance with an Agency-recommended protocol, even if the Agency 
subsequently recommends a different protocol, as long as the data 
fulfill the purposes of the requirements as described in this paragraph.
    (b) Previously developed data. The Agency will consider that data 
developed prior to the effective date of this part would be satisfactory 
to support applications provided good laboratory practices were 
followed, the data meet the purposes of this part, and the data

[[Page 202]]

permit sound scientific judgments to be made. Such data will not be 
rejected merely because they were not developed in accordance with 
suggested protocols.
    (c) Data developed in foreign countries. The Agency considers all 
applicable data developed from laboratory and field studies anywhere to 
be suitable to support pesticide registrations except for data from 
tests which involved field test sites or a test material, such as a 
native soil, plant, or animal, that is not characteristic of the United 
States. When studies at test sites or with materials of this type are 
anticipated, applicants should take steps to assure that United States 
materials are used or be prepared to supply data or information to 
demonstrate the lack of substantial or relevant differences between the 
selected material or test site and the United States material or test 
site. Once comparability has been established, the Agency will assess 
the acceptability of the data as described in paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (d) Data from monitoring studies. Certain data are developed to meet 
the monitoring requirements of FIFRA sections 5, 8 or 20. Applicants may 
wish to determine whether some of these data may meet the requirements 
of this part. In addition, data developed independently of FIFRA 
regulations or requirements may also satisfy data requirements in this 
part. Consultation with appropriate EPA Product Managers would be 
helpful if applicants are unsure about suitability of such data.

    (a) Data requirements will be revised from time to time to keep up 
with policy changes and technology. Revisions to this part will be made 
in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et 
seq.). Changes having a significant impact on the registration process, 
applicants, testers, or other parties, or on the outcome and evaluation 
of studies, will be made only after public notice and opportunity for 
comment. Until final rules reflecting a change have been promulgated, 
the Agency can implement changes in the data requirements on a case-by-
case basis.
    (b) The Agency invites registration applicants, registrants, and the 
general public to suggest changes in the data requirements or the 
Pesticide Assessment Guidelines. Suggestions may be submitted at any 
time. Those making suggestions are requested to contact, in writing, the 
Director of the Hazard Evaluation Division. When suggestions consist of 
new suggested methods, representative test results should accompany the 
submittals.

Sec. 161.100  How to determine registration data requirements.

    To determine the specific kinds of data needed to support the 
registration of each pesticide product, the registration applicant 
should:
    (a) Refer to subparts C and D (Sec. Sec. 161.150 through 161.640). 
These subparts describe the data requirements, including data tables for 
each subject area. The corresponding subdivisions in the Pesticide 
Assessment Guidelines are listed in Sec. 161.108.
    (b) Select the general use pattern(s) that best covers the use 
pattern(s) specified on the pesticide product label. Selection of the 
appropriate general use pattern(s) will usually be obvious. However, 
unique or ambiguous cases will arise occasionally. These situations may 
be clarified by reference to the Use Pattern Index presented in the 
appendix to the Data Requirements for Registration. The applicant can 
look up a specific use pattern in appendix A and it will be cross 
referenced to the appropriate general use patterns to be used in each 
Data Requirement table.
    (c) Proceed down the appropriate general use pattern column in the 
table and note which tests (listed along the left hand side of the 
table) are required (``R''), conditionally required (``CR'') or usually 
not required (``--''). After reading through each data requirement 
table, the applicant will have a complete list of required and 
conditionally required data for the pesticide product

[[Page 203]]

and the substance to be tested in developing data to meet each 
requirement. The data EPA must have available to review the registration 
of a specific product consists of all the data designated as required 
for that product and all the applicable data designated as conditionally 
required for that product.

[49 FR 42881, Oct. 24, 1984, as amended at 53 FR 15993, May 4, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 161.101  Required vs. conditionally required data.

    (a) Data designated as ``required'' (``R'') for products with a 
given general use pattern are needed by EPA to evaluate the risks or 
benefits of a product having that use pattern unless the data 
requirement has been waived under Sec. 161.45 for that particular 
product or unless the product is covered by a specific exception set 
forth in a note accompanying the requirement.
    (b) Data designated as ``conditionally required'' (``CR'') for 
products with a given general use pattern are needed by EPA to evaluate 
the risks or benefits of a product having that use pattern if the 
product meets the conditions specified in the corresponding notes 
accompanying the data requirements table. As indicated in the notes, the 
determination of whether the data must be submitted is based on the 
product's use pattern, physical or chemical properties, expected 
exposure of nontarget organisms, and/or results of previous testing 
(e.g., tier testing). Applicants must evaluate each applicable note to 
determine whether or not conditionally required data must be submitted 
as indicated by the conditions and criteria specified in the 
accompanying notes unless the Agency has granted a waiver request 
submitted by the registrant in accordance with Sec. 161.45.
    (c) For certain of the required or conditionally required data, the 
``R'' or ``CR'' designations and are enclosed in brackets (i.e., [R], 
[CR]). The brackets designate those data that are required or 
conditionally required to support a product when an experimental use 
permit is being sought. In all other situations (i.e., other than 
support of an experimental use permit), the brackets have no meaning and 
the designations R and CR are equivalent to [R] and [CR], respectively.

<R05>
Sec. 161.102  Distinguishing between what data are required and what substance is to be tested.

    (a) Readers should be careful to distinguish between what data are 
required and what substance is to be tested, as specified in this part 
and in each corresponding section of the guidelines. Each data 
requirement table specifies whether a particular data requirement is 
required to support the registration of manufacturing-use products, end-
use products, or both. The test substance column specifies which 
substance is to be subjected to testing. Thus, the data from a certain 
kind of study may be required to support the registration of each end-
use product, but the test substance column may state that the particular 
test shall be performed using, for example, the technical grade of the 
active ingredient(s) in the end-use product.
    (b) Manufacturing-use products (MP) and end-use products (EP) 
containing a single active ingredient and no inert ingredients are 
identical in composition to each other and to the technical grade of the 
active ingredient (TGAI) from which they were derived, and therefore, 
the data from a test conducted using any one of these as the test 
substance (e.g., TGAI) is also suitable to meet the requirement (if any) 
for the same test to be conducted using either of the other substances 
(i.e., MP or EP).

<R05>
Sec. 161.150  General.

    (a) Applicability. This subpart describes the product chemistry data 
that are required to support the registration of each pesticide product. 
The information specified in this subpart must be submitted with each 
application for new or amended registration or for reregistration, if it 
has not been submitted previously or if the previously submitted 
information is not complete and accurate. References in this subpart to 
the ``applicant'' include the registrant if the information is required 
for a registered product.
    (b) Purpose--(1) Product composition. (i) Data on product 
composition are needed to support the conclusions expressed in the 
statement of formula. These data include information on the starting 
materials, production or formulating process, possible formation of 
impurities, results of preliminary analysis of product samples, a 
description of analytical methods to identify and quantify ingredients 
and validation data for such methods. In addition, an applicant is 
required to certify the limits for ingredients of his product.
    (ii) Product composition data are compared to the composition of 
materials used in required testing under subpart D of this part. This 
comparison indicates which components of a pesticide product have been 
evaluated by a particular study, and might lead to a conclusion that 
another study is needed. Based on conclusions concerning the product's 
composition and its toxic properties, appropriate use restrictions, 
labeling requirements, or special packaging requirements may be imposed.
    (iii) Product composition data, including certified limits of 
components, are used to determine whether a product is ``identical or 
substantially similar'' to another product or ``differs only in ways 
that do not significantly increase the risk of unreasonable adverse 
effects on the environment'' (FIFRA sec. 3(c)(7)(A)). In nearly every 
case,

[[Page 205]]

this determination involves a comparison of the composition of an 
applicant's product with that of currently registered products.
    (2) Certified limits. Certified limits required by Sec. 161.175 are 
used in two ways. First, the Agency considers the certified limits in 
making the registration determination required by sections 3(c)(5), 
3(c)(7) and 3(d) of the Act and making other regulatory decisions 
required by the Act. Second, the Agency may collect commercial samples 
of the registered products and analyze them for the active 
ingredient(s), inert ingredients, or impurities determined by the Agency 
to be toxicologically significant. If, upon analysis the composition of 
such a sample is found to differ from that certified, the results may be 
used by the Agency in regulatory actions under FIFRA sec. 12(a)(1)(C) 
and other pertinent sections.
    (3) Nominal concentration. The nominal concentration required by 
Sec. 161.155 is the amount of active ingredient that is most likely to 
be present in the product when produced. Unlike the certified limits, 
which are the outer limits of the range of the product's ingredients and 
thus are present only in a small proportion of the products, the nominal 
concentration is the amount that typically is expected to result from 
the applicant's production or formulating process. The nominal 
concentration together with production process information is used to 
gauge the acceptability of the certified limits presented by the 
applicant. The nominal concentration is used by the Agency as the basis 
for enforceable certified limits if the applicant has chosen not to 
specify certified limits of his own (thereby agreeing to abide by the 
standard limits in Sec. 161.175).
    (4) Physical and chemical characteristics. (i) Data on the physical 
and chemical characteristics of pesticide active ingredients and 
products are used to confirm or provide supportive information on their 
identity. Such data are also used in reviewing the production or 
formulating process used to produce the pesticide or product. For 
example, data that indicate significant changes in production or 
formulation might indicate the need for additional information on 
product composition.
    (ii) Certain information (e.g., color, odor, physical state) is 
needed for the Agency to respond to emergency requests for 
identification of unlabeled pesticides involved in accidents or spills. 
Physicians, hospitals, and poison control centers also request this 
information to aid in their identification of materials implicated in 
poisoning episodes.
    (iii) Certain physical and chemical data are used directly in the 
hazard assessment. These include stability, oxidizing and reducing 
action, flammability, explodability, storage stability, corrosion, and 
dielectric breakdown voltage. For example, a study of the corrosion 
characteristics of a pesticide is needed to evaluate effects of the 
product formulation on its container. If the pesticide is highly 
corrosive, measures can be taken to ensure that lids, liners, seams or 
container sides will not be damaged and cause the contents to leak 
during storage, transport, handling, or use. The storage stability study 
provides data on change (or lack of change) in product composition over 
time. If certain ingredients decompose, other new chemicals are formed 
whose toxicity and other characteristics must be considered.
    (iv) Certain data are needed as basic or supportive evidence in 
initiating or evaluating other studies. For example, the octanol/water 
partition coefficient is used as one of the criteria to determine 
whether certain fish and wildlife toxicity or accumulation studies must 
be conducted. Vapor pressure data are needed, among other things, to 
determine suitable reentry intervals and other label cautions pertaining 
to worker protection. Data on viscosity and miscibility provide 
necessary information to support acceptable labeling for tank mix and 
spray applications.


<R05>
Sec. 161.153  Definitions.

    The following terms are defined for the purposes of this subpart:
    (a) Active ingredient means any substance (or group of structurally 
similar substances, if specified by the Agency) that will prevent, 
destroy, repel or mitigate any pest, or that functions as

[[Page 206]]

a plant regulator, desiccant, or defoliant within the meaning of FIFRA 
sec. 2(a).
    (b) End use product means a pesticide product whose labeling
    (1) Includes directions for use of the product (as distributed or 
sold, or after combination by the user with other substances) for 
controlling pests or defoliating, desiccating or regulating growth of 
plants, and
    (2) Does not state that the product may be used to manufacture or 
formulate other pesticide products.
    (c) Formulation means
    (1) The process of mixing, blending, or dilution of one or more 
active ingredients with one or more other active or inert ingredients, 
without an intended chemical reaction, to obtain a manufacturing use 
product or an end use product, or
    (2) The repackaging of any registered product.
    (d) Impurity means any substance (or group of structurally similar 
substances if specified by the Agency) in a pesticide product other than 
an active ingredient or an inert ingredient, including unreacted 
starting materials, side reaction products, contaminants, and 
degradation products.
    (e) Impurity associated with an active ingredient means:
    (1) Any impurity present in the technical grade of active 
ingredient; and
    (2) Any impurity which forms in the pesticide product through 
reactions between the active ingredient and any other component of the 
product or packaging of the product.
    (f) Inert ingredient means any substance (or group of structurally 
similar substances if designated by the Agency), other than an active 
ingredient, which is intentionally included in a pesticide product.
    (g) Integrated system means a process for producing a pesticide 
product that:
    (1) Contains any active ingredient derived from a source that is not 
an EPA-registered product; or
    (2) Contains any active ingredient that was produced or acquired in 
a manner that does not permit its inspection by the Agency under FIFRA 
sec. 9(a) prior to its use in the process.
    (h) Manufacturing use product means any pesticide product other than 
an end use product. A product may consist of the technical grade of 
active ingredient only, or may contain inert ingredients, such as 
stabilizers or solvents.
    (i) Nominal concentration means the amount of an ingredient which is 
expected to be present in a typical sample of a pesticide product at the 
time the product is produced, expressed as a percentage by weight.
    (j) Starting material means a substance used to synthesize or purify 
a technical grade of active ingredient (or the practical equivalent of 
the technical grade ingredient if the technical grade cannot be 
isolated) by chemical reaction.
    (k) Technical grade of active ingredient means a material containing 
an active ingredient:
    (1) Which contains no inert ingredient, other than one used for 
purification of the active ingredient; and
    (2) Which is produced on a commercial or pilot-plant production 
scale (whether or not it is ever held for sale).


<R05>

be present in the product, and why they may be present. The discussion 
should be based on established chemical theory and on what the applicant 
knows about the starting materials, technical grade of active 
ingredient, inert ingredients, and production or formulation process. If 
the applicant has reason to believe that an impurity that EPA would 
consider toxicologically significant may be present, the discussion must 
include an expanded discussion of the possible formation of the impurity 
and the amounts at which it might be present. The impurities which must 
be discussed are the following, as applicable:
    (a) Technical grade active ingredients and products produced by an 
integrated system. (1) Each impurity associated with the active 
ingredient which was found to be present in any analysis of the product 
conducted by or for the applicant.
    (2) Each other impurity which the applicant has reason to believe 
may be present in his product at any time before use at a level equal to 
or greater than 0.1 percent (1000 ppm) by weight of the technical grade 
of the active ingredient, based on what he knows about the following:
    (i) The composition (or composition range) of each starting material 
used to produce his product.
    (ii) The impurities which he knows are present (or believes are 
likely to be present) in the starting materials, and the known or 
presumed level (or range of levels) of those impurities.
    (iii) The intended reactions and side reactions which may occur in 
the production of the product, and the relative amounts of byproduct 
impurities produced by such reactions.
    (iv) The possible degradation of the ingredients in the product 
after its production but prior to its use.
    (v) Post-production reactions between the ingredients in the 
product.
    (vi) The possible migration of components of packaging materials 
into the pesticide.
    (vii) The possible carryover of contaminants from use of production 
equipment previously used to produce other products or substances.
    (viii) The process control, purification and quality control 
measures used to produce the product.
    (b) Products not produced by an integrated system. Each impurity 
associated with the active ingredient which the applicant has reason to 
believe may be present in the product at any time before use at a level 
equal to or greater than 0.1 percent (1000 ppm) by weight of the product 
based on what he knows about the following:
    (1) The possible carryover of impurities present in any registered 
product which serves as the source of any of the product's active 
ingredients. The identity and level of impurities in the registered 
source need not be discussed or quantified unless known to the 
formulator.
    (2) The possible carryover of impurities present in the inert 
ingredients in the product.
    (3) Possible reactions occurring during the formulation of the 
product between any of its active ingredients, between the active 
ingredients and inert ingredients, or between the active ingredients and 
the production equipment.
    (4) Post-production reactions between any of the product's active 
ingredients and any other component of the product or its packaging.
    (5) Possible migration of packaging materials into the product.
    (6) Possible contaminants resulting from earlier use of equipment to 
produce other products.
    (c) Expanded discussion. On a case-by-case basis, the Agency may 
require an expanded discussion of information of impurities:
    (1) From other possible chemical reactions;
    (2) Involving other ingredients; or
    (3) At additional points in the production or formulation process.


<R05>
Sec. 161.170  Preliminary analysis.

    (a) If the product is produced by an integrated system, the 
applicant must

[[Page 210]]

provide a preliminary analysis of each technical grade of active 
ingredient contained in the product to identify all impurities present 
at 0.1 percent or greater of the TGAI. The preliminary analysis should 
be conducted at the point in the production process after which no 
further chemical reactions designed to produce or purify the substance 
are intended.
    (b) Based on the preliminary analysis, a statement of the 
composition of the technical grade of active ingredient must be 
provided. If the technical grade of active ingredient cannot be 
isolated, a statement of the composition of the practical equivalent of 
the technical grade of active ingredient must be submitted.


<R05>
Sec. 161.175  Certified limits.

    The applicant must propose certified limits for the ingredients in 
the product. Certified limits become legally binding limits upon 
approval of the application. Certified limits will apply to the product 
from the date of production to date of use, unless the product label 
bears a statement prohibiting use after a certain date, in which case 
the certified limits will apply only until that date.
    (a) Ingredients for which certified limits are required. Certified 
limits are required on the following ingredients of a pesticide product:
    (1) An upper and lower limit for each active ingredient.
    (2) An upper and lower limit for each inert ingredient.
    (3) If the product is a technical grade of active ingredient or is 
produced by an integrated system, an upper limit for each impurity of 
toxicological significance associated with the active ingredient and 
found to be present in any sample of the product.
    (4) On a case-by-case basis, certified limits for other ingredients 
or impurities as specified by EPA.
    (b) EPA determination of certified limits for active and inert 
ingredients. (1) Unless the applicant proposes different limits as 
provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the upper and lower certified 
limits for active and inert ingredients will be determined by EPA. EPA 
will calculate the certified limits on the basis of the nominal 
concentration of the ingredient in the product, according to the table 
in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (2) Table of standard certified limits.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                      The certified limits for that
  If the nominal concentration        ingredient will be as follows:
   (N) for the ingredient is:   ----------------------------------------
                                     Upper limit          Lower limit
------------------------------------------------------------------------
N <= 1.0%......................  N + 10%N             N - 10%N
1.0% < N <= 20.0%..............  N + 5%N              N - 5%N
20.0% < N <= 100.0%............  N + 3%N              N - 3%N
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Applicant proposed limits. (1) The applicant may propose a 
certified limit for an active or inert ingredient that differs from the 
standard certified limit calculated according to paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section.
    (2) If certified limits are required for impurities, the applicant 
must propose a certified limit. The standard certified limits may not be 
used for such substances.
    (3) Certified limits should:
    (i) Be based on a consideration of the variability of the 
concentration of the ingredient in the product when good manufacturing 
practices and normal quality control procedures are used.
    (ii) Allow for all sources of variability likely to be encountered 
in the production process.
    (iii) Take into account the stability of the ingredient in the 
product and the possible formation of impurities between production and 
sale of distribution.
    (4) The applicant may include an explanation of the basis of his 
proposed certified limits, including how the certified limits were 
arrived at (e.g., sample analysis, quantitative estimate based on 
production process), and its accuracy and precision. This will be 
particularly useful if the range of the certified limit for an active or 
inert ingredient is greater than the standard certified limits.
    (d) Special cases. If the Agency finds unacceptable any certified 
limit (either standard or applicant-proposed), the Agency will inform 
the applicant of its determination and will provide supporting reasons. 
EPA may also recommend alternative limits to the applicant. The Agency 
may require, on a case-by-case basis, any or all of the following:
    (1) More precise limits.

[[Page 211]]

    (2) More thorough explanation of how the certified limits were 
determined.
    (3) A narrower range between the upper and lower certified limits 
than that proposed.
    (e) Certification statement. The applicant must certify the accuracy 
of the information presented, and that the certified limits of the 
ingredients will be maintained. The following statement, signed by the 
authorized representative of the company, is acceptable:

    I hereby certify that, for purposes of FIFRA sec. 12(a)(1)(C), the 
description of the composition of [product name], EPA Reg. No. [insert 
registration number], refers to the composition set forth on the 
Statement of Formula and supporting materials. This description includes 
the representations that: (1) no ingredient will be present in the 
product in an amount greater than the upper certified limit or in an 
amount less than the lower certified limit (if required) specified for 
that ingredient in a currently approved Statement of Formula (or as 
calculated by the Agency); and (2) if the Agency requires that the 
source of supply of an ingredient be specified, that all quantities of 
such ingredient will be obtained from the source specified in the 
Statement of Formula.


<R05>
Sec. 161.180  Enforcement analytical method.

    An analytical method suitable for enforcement purposes must be 
provided for each active ingredient in the product and for each other 
ingredient or impurity that is determined to be toxicologically 
significant.

<R05>
Sec. 161.202  Purposes of the registration data requirements.

    (a) General. The data requirements for registration are intended to 
generate data and information necessary to address concerns pertaining 
to the identity, composition, potential adverse effects and 
environmental fate of each pesticide.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Residue chemistry. (1) Residue Chemistry Data are used by the 
Agency to estimate the exposure of the general population to pesticide 
residues in food and for setting and enforcing tolerances for pesticide 
residues in food or feed.
    (2) Information on the chemical identity and composition of the 
pesticide product, the amounts, frequency and time of pesticide 
application, and results of test on the amount of residues remaining on 
or in the treated food or feed, are needed to support a finding as to 
the magnitude and identity of residues which result in food or animal 
feed as a consequence of a proposed pesticide usage.
    (3) Residue chemistry data are also needed to support the adequacy 
of one or more methods for the enforcement of the tolerance, and to 
support practicable methods for removing residues that exceed any 
proposed tolerance.
    (d) Environmental fate--(1) General. The data generated by 
environmental fate studies are used to: assess the toxicity to man 
through exposure of humans to pesticide residues remaining after 
application, either upon reentering treated areas or from consuming 
inadvertently-contaminated food; assess the presence of widely 
distributed and persistent pesticides in the environment which may 
result in loss of usable land, surface water, ground water, and wildlife 
resources; and, assess the potential environmental exposure of other 
nontarget organisms, such as fish and wildlife, to pesticides. Another 
specific purpose of the environmental fate data requirements is to help 
applicants and the Agency estimate expected environmental concentrations 
of pesticides in specific habitats where threatened or endangered 
species or other wildlife populations at risk are found.
    (2) Degradation studies. The data from hydrolysis and photolysis 
studies are used to determine the rate of pesticide degradation and to 
identify pesticides that may adversely affect nontarget organisms.
    (3) Metabolism studies. Data generated from aerobic and anaerobic 
metabolism studies are used to determine the nature and availability of 
pesticides to rotational crops and to aid in the evaluation of the 
persistence of a pesticide.
    (4) Mobility studies. These data requirements pertain to leaching, 
adsorption/desorption, and volatility of pesticides. They provide 
information on the mode of transport and eventual destination of the 
pesticide in the environment. This information is used to assess 
potential environmental hazards related to: contamination of human and 
animal food; loss of usable land and water resources to man through 
contamination of water (including ground water); and habitat loss of 
wildlife resulting from pesticide residue movement or transport in the 
environment.
    (5) Dissipation studies. The data generated from dissipation studies 
are used to assess potential environmental hazards (under actual field 
use conditions) related to: reentry into treated areas; hazards from 
residues in rotational crop and other food sources; and the loss of land 
as well as surface and ground water resources.
    (6) Accumulation studies. Accumulation studies indicate pesticide 
residue levels in food supplies that originate from wild sources or from 
rotational crops. Rotational crop studies are necessary to establish 
realistic crop rotation restrictions and to determine if tolerances may 
be needed for residues

[[Page 213]]

on rotational crops. Data from irrigated crop studies are used to 
determine the amount of pesticide residues that could be taken up by 
representative crops irrigated with water containing pesticide residues. 
These studies allow the Agency to establish label restrictions regarding 
application of pesticides on sites where the residues can be taken up by 
irrigated crops. These data also provide information that aids the 
Agency in establishing any corresponding tolerances that would be needed 
for residues on such crops. Data from pesticides accumulation studies in 
fish are used to establish label restrictions to prevent applications in 
certain sites so that there will be minimal residues entering edible 
fish or shell fish. These residue data are also used to determine if a 
tolerance or action level is needed for residues in aquatic animals 
eaten by humans.
    (e) Hazard to humans and domestic animals. Data required to assess 
hazards to humans and domestic animals are derived from a variety of 
acute, subchronic and chronic toxicity tests, and tests to assess 
mutagenicity and pesticide metabolism.
    (1) Acute studies. Determination of acute oral, dermal and 
inhalation toxicity is usually the initial step in the assessment and 
evaluation of the toxic characteristics of a pesticide. These data 
provide information on health hazards likely to arise soon after, and as 
a result of, short-term exposure. Data from acute studies serve as a 
basis for classification and precautionary labeling. For example, acute 
toxicity data are used to calculate farmworker reentry intervals and to 
develop precautionary label statements pertaining to protective clothing 
requirements for applicators. They also: provide information used in 
establishing the appropriate dose levels in subchronic and other 
studies; provide initial information on the mode of toxic action(s) of a 
substance; and determine the need for child resistant packaging. 
Information derived from primary eye and primary dermal irritation 
studies serves to identify possible hazards from exposure of the eyes, 
associated mucous membranes and skin.
    (2) Subchronic studies. Subchronic tests provide information on 
health hazards that may arise from repeated exposures over a limited 
period of time. They provide information on target organs and 
accumulation potential. The resulting data are also useful in selecting 
dose levels for chronic studies and for establishing safety criteria for 
human exposure. These tests are not capable of detecting those effects 
that have a long latency period for expression (e.g., carcinogenicity).
    (3) Chronic studies. Chronic toxicity (usually conducted by feeding 
the test substance to the test species) studies are intended to 
determine the effects of a substance in a mammalian species following 
prolonged and repeated exposure. Under the conditions of this test, 
effects which have a long latency period or are cumulative should be 
detected. The purpose of long-term oncogenicity studies is to observe 
test animals over most of their life span for the development of 
neoplastic lesions during or after exposure to various doses of a test 
substance by an appropriate route of administration.
    (4) Teratogenicity and reproduction studies. The teratogenicity 
study is designed to determine the potential of the test substance to 
induce structural and/or other abnormalities to the fetus as the result 
of exposure of the mother during pregnancy. Two-generation reproduction 
testing is designed to provide information concerning the general 
effects of a test substance on gonadal function, estrus cycles, mating 
behavior, conception, parturition, lactation, weaning, and the growth 
and development of the offspring. The study may also provide information 
about the effects of the test substance on neonatal morbidity, 
mortality, and preliminary data on teratogenesis and serve as a guide 
for subsequent tests.
    (5) Mutagenicity studies. For each test substance a battery of tests 
are required to assess potential to affect the mammalian cell's genetic 
components. The objectives underlying the selection of a battery of 
tests for mutagenicity assessment are:
    (i) To detect, with sensitive assay methods, the capacity of a 
chemical to alter genetic material in cells.

[[Page 214]]

    (ii) To determine the relevance of these mutagenic changes to 
mammals.
    (iii) When mutagenic potential is demonstrated, to incorporate these 
findings in the assessment of heritable effects, oncogenicity, and 
possibly, other health effects.
    (6) Metabolism studies. Data from studies on the absorption, 
distribution, excretion, and metabolism of a pesticide aid in the 
valuation of test results from other toxicity studies and in the 
extrapolation of data from animals to man. The main purpose of 
metabolism studies is to produce data which increase the Agency's 
understanding of the behavior of the chemical in its consideration of 
the human exposure anticipated from intended uses of the pesticide.
    (f) Reentry Protection. Data required to assess hazard to farm 
employees resulting from reentry into areas treated with pesticides are 
derived from studies on toxicity, residue dissipation, and human 
exposure. Monitoring data generated during exposure studies are used to 
determine the quantity of pesticide to which people may be exposed after 
application and to develop reentry intervals.
    (g) Pesticide Spray Drift Evaluation. Data required to evaluate 
pesticide spray drift are derived from studies of droplet size spectrum 
and spray drift field evaluations. These data contribute to development 
of the overall exposure estimate and along with data on toxicity for 
humans, fish and wildlife, or plants are used to assess the potential 
hazard of pesticides to these organisms. A purpose common to all these 
tests is to provide data which will be used to determine the need for 
(and appropriate wording for) precautionary labeling to minimize the 
potential adverse effect to nontarget organisms.
    (h) Hazard to nontarget organisms--(1) General. The information 
required to assess hazards to nontarget organisms are derived from tests 
to determine pesticidal effects on birds, mammals, fish, terrestrial and 
aquatic invertebrates, and plants. These tests include short-term acute, 
subacute, reproduction, simulated field, and full field studies arranged 
in a hierarchial or tier system which progresses from the basic 
laboratory tests to the applied field tests. The results of each tier of 
tests must be evaluated to determine the potential of the pesticide to 
cause adverse effects, and to determine whether further testing is 
required. A purpose common to all data requirements is to provide data 
which determines the need for (and appropriate wording for) 
precautionary label statements to minimize the potential adverse effects 
to nontarget organisms.
    (2) Short term studies. The short-term acute and subchronic 
laboratory studies provide basic toxicity information which serves as a 
starting point for the hazard assessment. These data are used: to 
establish acute toxicity levels of the active ingredient to the test 
organisms; to compare toxicity information with measured or estimated 
pesticide residues in the environment in order to assess potential 
impacts on fish, wildlife and other nontarget organisms; and to indicate 
whether further laboratory and/or field studies are needed.
    (3) Long term and field studies. Additional studies (i.e., avian, 
fish, and invertebrate reproduction, lifecycle studies and plant field 
studies) may be required when basic data and environmental conditions 
suggest possible problems. Data from these studies are used to: estimate 
the potential for chronic effects, taking into account the measured or 
estimated residues in the environment; and to determine if additional 
field or laboratory data are necessary to further evaluate hazards. 
Simulated field and/or field data are used to examine acute and chronic 
adverse effects on captive or monitored fish and wildlife populations 
under natural or near-natural environments. Such studies are required 
only when predictions as to possible adverse effects in less extensive 
studies cannot be made, or when the potential for adverse effects is 
high.
    (i) Product performance. Requirements to develop data on product 
performance provide a mechanism to ensure that pesticide products will 
control the pests listed on the label and that unnecessary pesticide 
exposure to the environment will not occur as a result of the use of 
ineffective products. Specific

[[Page 215]]

performance standards are used to validate the efficacy data in the 
public health areas, including disinfectants used to control 
microorganisms infectious to man in any area of the inanimate 
environment and those pesticides used to control vertebrates (such as 
rodents, birds, bats and skunks) that may directly or indirectly 
transmit diseases to humans.

Key: R=Required data; CR=Conditionally required data; TGAI=Technical grade of the active ingredient; PAIRA=Pure active ingredient, radio labeled; EP=End-use product; TEP=Typical end-use
  product; MP=Manufacturing-use product; [ ]=Brackets (i.e., [R], [CR]) indicate data requirements that apply when an experimental use permit is being sought.
(b) Notes. The following notes are referenced in column two of the table contained in paragraph (a) of this section.
(1) The same chemical identity data as required under subpart C of this part are required, with emphasis on impurities that could constitute a residue problem.
(2) Required information includes crops to be treated, rate of application, number and timing of applications, preharvest intervals, and relevant restrictions.
(3) Data on metabolism in livestock are required when residues occur on a livestock feed, or the pesticide is to be applied directly to livestock.
(4) A residue method for enforcement of tolerances is needed whenever a numeric tolerance is proposed. Exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance will also usually require an analytical
  method. Analytical methods used to enforce residue limits for emergency exemptions, temporary tolerances and permanent tolerances must be available for use by enforcement agencies and thus
  may not be claimed as confidential business information.
(5) Data on the nature and level of residue in processed food/feed are required when detectable residues could concentrate on processing and thus require establishment of a food additive
  tolerance.

[[Page 217]]

 
(6) Livestock feeding studies are required whenever a pesticide occurs as a residue in a livestock feed. Use involving direct application to livestock, including poultry, will require animal
  treatment residue studies.
(7) Data on residues in potable water are required whenever a pesticide is to be applied directly to water, unless it can be determined that the treated water would not be used (eventually)
  for drinking purpose, by man or animals.
(8) Data on residue in fish are required whenever a pesticide is to be applied directly to water inhabited by fish.
(9) Data on residues in irrigated crops are required when a pesticide is to be applied directly to water that could be used for irrigation or to irrigation facilities such as irrigation
  ditches.
(10) Data on residues in food/feed in food handling establishments are required whenever a pesticide is to be used in food/feed handling establishments. Disinfectants and sanitizers used in
  food or feed handling establishment are exempt from this requirement if their residues are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration at 21 CFR 178.1010.
(11) Reduction of residue data are required when the assumption of tolerance level residues would result in predicted exposure at an unsafe level. Data on the level of residue in food as
  consumed will be used to obtain a more precise estimate of potential dietary exposure. The Agency recommends that such data be generated to support all pesticides requiring a tolerance in
  case new data are revealed which indicates the pesticide is more toxic than initially determined.
(12) The proposed tolerance must reflect the maximum residue likely to occur in crops and meat/milk/poultry eggs.
(13) Residue data for outdoor domestic uses are required if home gardens are to be treated and the home garden use pattern is different from the use pattern on which the tolerance was
  established.
(14) Required to support registration of an indoor use pesticide if such a use could result in residues in food or feed.
(15) For all food uses, data on whether the FDA/USDA multiresidue methodology would detect and identify the pesticide are required.

  test substances, depending on studies required.
(b) Notes. The following notes are referenced in column two of the table contained in paragraph (a) of this section.
(1) Not required if test material is a gas or highly volatile.
(2) Not required if test material is corrosive to skin or has pH less than 2 or greater than 11.5; such a product will be classified as toxicity category I on the basis of potential eye and
  dermal irritation effects.
(3) Required unless repeated dermal exposure does not occur under conditions of use.
(4) Not required unless test material, is an organophosphate, or a metabolite or degradation product thereof which causes acetyl cholinesterase depression or is structurally related to a
  substance that causes delayed neurotoxicity.
(5) Required if use involves purposeful dermal application to, or prolonged exposure of, human skin.
(6) Required if use may result in repeated inhalation exposure at a concentration likely to be toxic. A test with duration of 21 days is required if pesticide is used on tobacco.
(7) Required if acute delayed neurotoxicity test showed neuropathy or neurotoxicity or if closely related structural to a compound which can induce these effects.
(8) Required if acute oral, dermal, or inhalation studies showed neuropathy or neurotoxicity.
(9)(i) Studies designed to simultaneously meet the requirements of both the chronic feeding and oncogenicity studies (i.e., a combined study) can be conducted.
(ii) Minimum acceptable test durations for chronic feeding and oncogenicity studies are as follows:
(A) Chronic rodent feeding study (food use pesticides)--24 months.
(B) Chronic rodent feeding study (non-food pesticides)--12 months is usually sufficient.
(C) Chronic nonrodent (i.e., dog) feeding study--12 months.
(D) Mouse oncogenicity study--18 months.
(E) Rat oncogenicity study--24 months.
(10) Required to support products intended for food uses and to supoort products intended for non-food uses if significant exposure of human females of child bearing age may reasonably be
  expected.
(11) Required to support products intended for food uses and to support products intended for non-food uses if use of the product is likely to result in human exposure over a portion of the
  human lifespan which is significant in terms of the frequency of exposure, magnitude of exposure, or the duration of exposure (for example; pesticides used in treated fabrics for wearing
  apparel, diapers, or bedding; insect repellents applied directly to human skin; swimming pool additives; constant-release indoor pesticides which are used in aerosol form).
(12) Required on a case by case basis.
(13) In most cases, where theoretical maximum residue contribution (TMRC) exceeds 50 percent of the maximum permitted intake (MPI), a one year (or longer) interim report on a chronic feed
  study is required to support a temporary tolerance.
(14) In most cases, where theoretical maxium residue contribution (TMRC) exceeds 50 percent of the maxium permitted intake (MPI), a first generation (or longer) interim report on a
  multigeneration reproduction study is required to support a temporary tolerance.
(15) A teratology study in one species is required to support a temporary tolerance.
(16) Required if the product consists of, or under conditions of use will result in, an inhalable material (e.g., gas volatile substances, or aerosol/particulate).
(17) Required if intended use(s) of the pesticide product is expected to result in human exposure to the product, under the following conditions:
(i) Human exposure is via the oral route.
(ii) Expected human exposure is over a limited portion of the human lifespan, yet is significant in terms of the frequency of exposure, magnitude of exposure, or the duration of exposure (for
  example, products requiring a temporary tolerance to support an experimental use permit or emergency exemption).
(18) Required if intended use(s) of the pesticide product is expected to result in human exposure to the product, under the following conditions:
(i) Human exposure is via skin contact.
(ii) Expected human skin contact is not purposeful, and such exposure is of limited frequence and duration (for example, such exposure could result from use of certain disinfectant, liquid
  fumigant or agricultural or home/garden pesticide products, and other circumstances where the Agency determines that more than acute dermal exposure is involved).
(iii) Data from a subchronic 90-day dermal toxicity study are not required.

[[Page 221]]

 
(19) Required if pesticidal use will involve purposeful application to the human skin or will result in comparable human exposure to the product, (e.g., swimming pool algaecides, pesticides
  for impregnating clothing), and if either of the following criteria are met:
(i) Data from a subchronic oral study are not required.
(ii) The active ingredient of the product is known or expected to be metabolized differently by the dermal route of exposure than by the oral route, and a metabolite of the active ingredient
  is the toxic moiety.
(20) Required if either of the following criteria are met:
(i) Use of the pesticide product is likely to result in repeated human exposure to the product, over a significant portion of the human life-span (for example, products intended for use in and
  around residences, swimming pools, and enclosed working spaces or their immediate vicinity).
(ii) The use requires a tolerance for the pesticide or an exemption from the requirement to obtain a tolerance, or requires issuance of a food additive regulation.
(21) Required if any of the following criteria are met:
(i) The active ingredient(s) or any of its (their) metabolites, degradation products, or impurities:
(A) Is structually related to a recognized carcinogen.
(B) Is a substance that cause mutagenic effect as demonstrated by in vitro or in vivo testing.
(C) Produces in subchronic studies a morphologic effect (e.g., hyperplasia, metaplasia) in any organ that may lead to neoplastic change.
(ii) The use requires a tolerance for the pesticide or exemption from the requirement to obtain a tolerance, or requires the issuance of a food additive regulation.
(iii) Use of the pesticide product is likely to result in human exposure over a portion of the human lifespan which is significant in terms of either the time the exposure occurs or the
  duration of exposure (for example; pesticides used in treated fabrics for wearing apparel, diapers, or bedding; insect repellents applied directly to human skin; swimming pool additives;
  constant-release indoor pesticides which are used in aerosol form).
(22)(i) The required battery of mutagenicity tests must include tests appropriate to address the following three categories in accordance with the objectives set forth in Sec.  161.202:
(A) Gene mutations.
(B) Structural chromosomal aberrations.
(C) Other genotoxic effects as appropriate for the test substance, e.g., numerical chromosome abberations, direct DNA damage and repair, mammalian cells transformation, target organ/cell
  analysis.
(ii) Currently recognized tests for each of these categories are listed with the National Technical Information Service (NTIS). Applicants shall explain their reasons for selecting specific
  tests from the battery of currently recognized tests. Because of the rapid improvements in this field, applicants are encouraged to discuss with the Agency: test selection, protocol design
  and results of preliminary testing.
(iii) Not required if the pesticide use pattern precludes human exposure (e.g., nonvolatile pesticides packaged and used in enclosed bait boxes).
(23) Required if chronic feeding or oncogenicity studies are required.
(24) Dermal absorption studies required for compounds having a serious toxic effect as identified by oral or inhalation studies, for which a significant route of human exposure is dermal and
  for which the assumption of 100 percent absorption does not produce an adequate margin of safety. Registrants should work closely with the Agency in developing an acceptable protocol and
  performing dermal absorption studies.

  ingredient; TEP=Typical end-use product; PAI=``Pure'' active ingredient.
(b) Notes. The following notes are referenced in column two of the table contained in paragraph (a) of this section.
(1)(i) Data are required as follows to support manufacturing use products and those end-use products for indoor use for which there is no registered manufacturing use product:
(A) Solid formulation indoor use products require avian oral LD50 (bobwhite), avian dietary LC50 (bobwhite), freshwater fish LC50 (rainbow trout) and acute LC50 freshwater invertebrate
  (Daphnia).

[[Page 224]]

 
(B) Liquid formulation indoors use products require all tests listed under (b)(1)(i) of this section except the avian oral LD50.
(ii) Data are not required to support:
(A) Indoor end-use products consisting of a gas/highly volatile liquid or a highly reactive solid.
(B) Indoor end-use products for which there is a manufacturing use product registration.
(2) Tests required on a case-by-case basis depending on the results of lower tier studies such as acute and subacute testing, intended use pattern, and pertinent environmental fate
  characteristics.
(3) Data required if one or more of the following criteria are met:
(i) Birds may be subjected to repeated or continued exposure to the pesticide or any of its major metabolite degradation products, especially preceding or during the breeding season.
(ii) The pesticide or any of its major metabolites or degradation products are stable in the environment to the extent that potentially toxic amounts may persist in avian feed.
(iii) The pesticide or any of its major metalolites or degradation products is stored or accumulated in plant animal tissues, as indicated by its octanol/water partition coefficient,
  accumulation studies, metabolic release and retention studies, or as indicated by structural similarity to known bioaccumulative chemicals.
(iv) Any other information, such as that derived from mammalian reproduction studies that indicates the reproduction in terrestrial vertebrates may be adversely affected by the anticipated use
  of the pesticide product.
Note: Prior to conducting this test to support the registration of an avicide, the applicant should consult the Agency.
(4) Data required if the product is intended for direct application to the estuarine or marine environment, or the product is expected to enter this environment in significant concentrations
  because of its expected use or mobility pattern.
(5) Data from fish early life-stage tests or life-cycle tests with aquatic invertebrates (on whichever species is most sensitive to the pesticide as determined from the results of the acute
  toxicity tests) are required if the product is applied directly to water or expected to be transported to water from the intended use site, and when any one or more of the following
  conditions apply:
(i) If the pesticide is intended for use such that its presence in water is likely to be continuous or recurrent regardless of toxicity.
(ii) If any LC 50 or EC 50 value determined in acute toxicity testing is less than 1 mg/l; or
(iii) If the estimated environmental concentration in water is equal to or greater than 0.01 of any EC 50 or LC 50 determined in acute toxicity testing.
(iv) If the actual or estimated environmental concentration in water resulting from use is less than 0.01 of any EC50 or LC50 determined in acute toxicity testing and any of the following
  conditions exist:
(A) Studies of other organisms indicate the reproductive physiology of fish and/or invertebrates may be affected.
(B) Physiochemical properties indicate cumulative effects.
(C) The pesticide is persistent in water (e.g., half-life in water greater than 4 days).
(6) Data are required if end-use product is intended to be applied directly to water or expected to transport to water from the intended use site, and when any of the following conditions
  apply:
(i) if the estimated environmental concentration is equal to or greater than one-tenth of the no-effect level in the fish early life-stage or invertebrate life-cycle test.
(ii) If studies of other organisms indicate the reproductive physiology of fish may be affected. NOTE: The applicant should consult the Agency prior to these tests to support the registration
  of a pesticide.
(7) Data from testing with the applicant's end-use product or a typical end-use product is required to support the registration of each end-use product which meets any one of the following
  conditions:
(i) The end-use pesticide will be introduced directly not an aquatic environment when used as directed.
(ii) The LC50 or EC50 of the technical grade of active ingredient is equal to or less than the maximum expected environmental concentration (MEEC) or the estimated environmental concentration
  (EEC) in the aquatic environment when the end-use pesticide is used as directed.
(iii) An ingredient in the end-use formulation other than the active ingredient is expected to enhance the toxicity of the active ingredient or to cause toxicity to aquatic organisms.
(8) Required if significant concentrations of the active ingredient and/or its principal degradation products are likely to occur in aquatic environments and may accumulate in aquatic
  organisms.

Key: R=Required; CR=Conditionally required; [ ]=Brackets (i.e., [R], [CR]) indicate data requirements that apply to products for which an experimental use permit is being sought; EP=End-use
  product* (asterisk identifies those data requirements that end-use applicants (i.e., ``formulators'') must satisfy, provided that their active ingredient(s) is (are) purchased from a
  registered source); MP=Manufacturing use product; TEP=Typical end-use product.
(b) Notes: The following notes are referenced in column two of the table contained in paragraph (a) of this section.
(1) The Agency has waived all requirements to submit efficacy data unless the pesticide product bears a claim to control pest microorganisms that pose a threat to human health and whose
  presence cannot readily be observed by the user including, but not limited to, microorganisms infectious to man in any area of the inanimate environment or a claim to control vertebrates
  (such as rodents, birds, bats, canids, and skunks) that may directly or indirectly transmit diseases to humans. However, each registrant must ensure through testing that his products are
  efficacious when used in accordance with label directions and commonly accepted pest control practices. The Agency reserves the right to require, on a case-by-case basis, submission of
  efficacy data for any pesticide product registered or proposed for registration.

Sec. 162.150  General.

    (a) Scope. This subpart sets forth regulations governing the 
registration by any State of pesticide products, or uses thereof, 
formulated for distribution and use within the State to meet special 
local needs under sec. 24(c) of the Act. It also sets forth regulations 
governing the exercise by the Administrator of the power to disapprove 
specific State registrations and to suspend a State's registration 
authority under sec. 24(c). Unless otherwise indicated, any reference 
herein to registrations issued by a State includes amendments of 
registrations issued by States.
    (b) Applicability. This subpart applies only to State registration 
authority granted by sec. 24(c) of FIFRA. It does not apply to any 
authority granted, or procedures established, by State law with respect 
to registration, licensing, or approval required for use within the 
State of federally registered pesticide products.

Sec. 162.151  Definitions.

    Terms used in this part have the same meaning as in the Act and part 
152 of this chapter. In addition, as used in this subpart, the following 
terms shall apply:
    Federally registered means currently registered under section 3 of 
the Act, after having been initially registered under the Federal 
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act of 1947 by the Secretary of 
Agriculture or under FIFRA by the Administrator.
    Manufacturing-use product means any pesticide product other than a 
product to be labeled with directions for end use. This term includes 
any product intended for use as a pesticide after reformulation or 
repackaging.
    New product means a pesticide product which is not a federally 
registered product.
    Pest problem means:
    (1) A pest infestation and its consequences, or
    (2) Any condition for which the use of plant regulators, defoliants, 
or desiccants would be appropriate.
    Product or pesticide product means a pesticide offered for 
distribution and use, and includes any labeled container and any 
supplemental labeling.
    Similar composition means a pesticide product which contains only 
the same active ingredient(s), or combinations of

[[Page 234]]

active ingredients, and which is in the same toxicity category, as 
defined in Sec. 156.62 of this chapter, as a federally registered 
pesticide product.
    Similar product means a pesticide product which, when compared to a 
federally registered product, has a similar composition and a similar 
use pattern.
    Similar use pattern means a use of a pesticide product which, when 
compared to a federally registered use of a product with a similar 
composition, does not require a change in precautionary labeling under 
part 156 of this chapter, and which is substantially the same as the 
federally registered use. Registrations involving changed use patterns 
are not included in this term.
    Special local need means an existing or imminent pest problem within 
a State for which the State lead agency, based upon satisfactory 
supporting information, has determined that an appropriate federally 
registered pesticide product is not sufficiently available.
    State or State lead agency means the State agency designated by the 
State to be responsible for registering pesticides to meet special local 
needs under section 24(c) of the Act.

[73 FR 75597, Dec. 12, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 162.152  State registration authority.

    (a) Statutory limitations. In accordance with sec. 24(c) of the Act, 
each State is authorized to register a new end use product for any use, 
or an additional use of a federally registered pesticide product, if the 
following conditions exist:
    (1) There is a special local need for the use within the State;
    (2) The use is covered by necessary tolerances, exemptions or other 
clearances under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 346 
et seq.), if the use is a food or feed use;
    (3) Registration for the same use has not previously been denied, 
disapproved, suspended or cancelled by the Administrator, or voluntarily 
cancelled by the registrant subsequent to issuance by the Administrator 
of a notice of intent to cancel that registration, because of health or 
environmental concerns about an ingredient contained in the pesticide 
product, unless such denial, disapproval, suspension or cancellation has 
been superseded by subsequent action of the Administrator; and
    (4) The registration is in accord with the purposes of FIFRA.
    (b) Types of registrations--(1) Amendments to federal registrations. 
(i) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b)(1)(ii) through 
(iv) of this section, States may register any new use of a federally 
registered pesticide product.
    (ii) A State may register any use of a federally registered product 
for which registration of other uses of the product was denied, 
disapproved, suspended, or cancelled by the Administrator, provided that 
the State may register a use not considered by the Administrator in 
reaching such a determination only after the State consults with 
appropriate EPA personnel.
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a 
State may register any use of a federally registered product for which 
registration of some or all uses has been voluntarily cancelled by the 
registrant, provided that a State may register such a use only after the 
State has consulted with appropriate EPA personnel.
    (iv) A State may not register an amendment to a federally registered 
manufacturing-use product.
    (2) New products. (i) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (a) and 
subparagraphs (b)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section, a State may issue 
registrations to meet special local needs for the following types of new 
end-use products:
    (A) A product which is identical in composition to a federally 
registered product, but which has differences in packaging, or in the 
identity of the formulator.
    (B) A product which contains the same active and inert ingredients 
as a federally registered product, but in different percentages.
    (C) Subject to the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this 
section, a product containing a new combination of active, or active and 
inert, ingredients.

[[Page 235]]

    (ii) A State may register a new product only if each of the active 
ingredients in the new product is present because of the use of one or 
more federally registered products and if each of the inert ingredients 
in the new product is contained in a federally registered product.
    (iii) A State may not register a new manufacturing-use product.
    (iv) A State may register any use of a new product containing an 
ingredient described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, if the new 
product registration is for a formulation or a use not included in the 
denial, disapproval, suspension, or cancellation, or if the federally 
registered use was voluntarily cancelled without a prior notice of 
intent to cancel by the Administrator. However, a formulation or use of 
such a new product which was not considered by the Administrator during 
such proceedings, or which was not the subject of a notice of intent to 
cancel, may be registered by a State only after the State consults with 
appropriate EPA personnel regarding the registration application.
    (c) Effect of State registration. (1) A State registration issued 
under FIFRA sec. 24(c) which meets the conditions described in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and which is not disapproved by 
the Administrator under Sec. 162.154, shall be considered a federal 
registration, but shall authorize distribution and use only within that 
State. Accordingly, such registrations are subject to all provisions of 
FIFRA which apply to currently registered products, including provisions 
for cancellation and suspension of registrations, and reregistration of 
products.
    (2) A State may require, as a condition of distribution or use of a 
pesticide product within the State, that the pesticide product be 
registered under State law as well as under FIFRA. Neither FIFRA sec. 
24(c) nor Sec. Sec. 162.150-162.156 affects a State's right under its 
own law to revoke, suspend, cancel, or otherwise affect such a 
registration issued under State law. However, the federal registration, 
whether issued under FIFRA sec. 3 or 24(c), is not affected by such a 
State action.

<R05>
Sec. 162.153  State registration procedures.

    (a) Application for registration. States shall require all 
applicants for registration to submit the following information:
    (1) Name and address of the applicant and any other person whose 
name will appear on the labeling or in the directions for use.
    (2) The name of the pesticide product, and, if the application is 
for an amendment to a federally registered product, the EPA registration 
number of that product.
    (3) A copy of proposed labeling, including all claims made for the 
product as well as directions for its use to meet the special local 
need, consisting of:
    (i) For a new product, a copy of the complete proposed labeling; or,
    (ii) For an additional use of a federally registered product, a copy 
of proposed supplemental labeling and a copy of the labeling for the 
federally registered product.
    (4) The complete formula of the product, if the application is for a 
new product registration.
    (5) Any other information which is required to be reviewed prior to 
registration under this section.
    (b) Special local need determination. In reviewing any application 
for registration, the State shall determine whether there is a special 
local need for the registration. Situations which a State may consider 
as not involving a special local need may include, but are not limited 
to, applications for registrations to control a pest problem present on 
a nationwide basis, or for use of a pesticide product registered by 
other States on an interregional or nationwide basis.
    (c) Unreasonable adverse effects determination. (1) Prior to issuing 
a registration in the following cases, the State shall determine that 
use of the product for which registration is sought will not cause 
unreasonable adverse effects on man or the environment, when used in 
accordance with labeling directions or widespread and commonly 
recognized practices:
    (i) For use of a product which has a composition not similar to any 
federally registered product.

[[Page 236]]

    (ii) For use of a project involving a use pattern not similar to any 
federally registered use of the same product or of a product with a 
similar composition.
    (iii) For use of a product for which other uses of the same product, 
or of a product with a similar composition, have had registration 
denied, disapproved, suspended, or cancelled by the Administrator.
    (2) Determinations required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
shall be based on data and criteria consistent with those sections of 
part 152 of this chapter, applicable to the type of product or use under 
consideration. Such determinations may also involve consideration of the 
effect of the anticipated classification of the product or use under 
paragraph (g) of this section.
    (d) Efficacy determination. Prior to registration of any use of a 
product for public health purposes--that is, a use which could result in 
substantial harm to the public health if the product does not perform 
its intended function, the State shall determine that the product 
warrants the claims made for it in the registration application. Such 
determinations shall be based on criteria specified in applicable 
sections of part 152 of this chapter and on any additional criteria 
established by the State.
    (e) Labeling requirements. (1) Prior to issuing any registration, 
the State shall review the proposed labeling submitted with the 
application to determine compliance with this paragraph. In addition, 
the State shall review a copy of the final printed labeling as soon as 
practical after a registration is issued in order to verify compliance 
with this paragraph.
    (2) For a new product, the State must, as a condition of the 
registration, require that the product be accompanied from the time it 
enters the stream of commerce by labeling meeting all applicable 
criteria of Sec. 156.10 of this chapter. New product labeling must all 
contain:
    (i) A statement identifying the State where registration is to be 
valid.
    (ii) The special local need registration number assigned by the 
State.
    (3) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, as a 
condition for a registration of an additional use of a federally 
registered product, the State must require that at the time of sale to 
users, labeling from the federally registered product be accompanied by 
supplemental labeling which contains:
    (i) A statement identifying the State where registration is valid.
    (ii) Directions for use to meet the special local need which satisfy 
the criteria of Sec. 156.10(i) of this chapter.
    (iii) The trade name of the product.
    (iv) The name and address of the section 24(c) registrant.
    (v) The EPA registration number of the federally registered product.
    (vi) The special local need registration number assigned by the 
State.
    (vii) A statement prohibiting use of the product in a manner 
inconsistent with all applicable directions, restrictions, and 
precautions found in the labeling of the federally registered product 
and accompanying supplemental labeling.
    (4) When a federally registered product is already in the stream of 
commerce at the time the State issues a registration for an additional 
use of that product, the State must ensure that supplemental labeling 
for the additional use, meeting the criteria of paragraph (e)(3) of this 
section, is made available to purchasers and users of the product within 
45 days of the date on which the State approves the final printed 
supplemental labeling.
    (5) If a State classifies for restricted use a product or use 
registered by the State, which is not required to be so classified by 
paragraph (g) of this section, then the State may require supplemental 
labeling for the product or use containing additional appropriate 
precautions, and a statement that the product or use is for restricted 
use within that State.
    (f) Packaging and coloration standards. All products registered by a 
State must meet all appropriate packaging standards prescribed by the 
Administrator under sec. 25(c)(3) of FIFRA. State registered products 
must also meet all appropriate standards for coloration, or 
discoloration, established by regulation under sec. 25(c) of FIFRA, 
including the standards contained in subpart H of part 153 of this 
chapter. Prior to issuing any registration, the State

[[Page 237]]

shall determine that the product will conform to these requirements.
    (g) Classification. (1) As part of the registration of any product 
or use, a State shall classify the product or use as a restricted use 
pesticide if:
    (i) The product is identical or similar in composition to a 
federally registered product:
    (A) For which all federally registered uses have been classified as 
restricted by the Administrator; or
    (B) For which a use similar to the State registered use has been 
classified as restricted by the Administrator; or
    (ii) The State registered product or use meets the criteria for 
classification as a restricted use pesticide under the applicable 
provisions of Sec. 152.170 of this chapter.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (h) Notification and submission of data. (1) Within ten working days 
from the date a State issues, amends, or revokes a registration, the 
State shall notify EPA, in writing, of the action. Notification of State 
registrations, or amendments thereto, shall include the effective date 
of the registration or amendment, a confidential statement of the 
formula of any new product, and a copy of the draft labeling reviewed 
and approved by the State, provided that labeling previously approved by 
the Administrator as part of a federal registration need not be 
submitted.
    (2) Notification of State registrations or amendments shall be 
supplemented by the State sending to EPA a copy of the final printed 
labeling approved by the State within 60 days after the effective date 
of the registration or amendment.
    (3) Notification of revocation of a registration by a State shall 
indicate the effective date of revocation, and shall state the reasons 
for revocation.
    (4) The Administrator or his designee may request, when appropriate, 
that a State submit to EPA any data used by the State to determine that 
unreasonable adverse effects will not be caused when the State registers 
any use described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Within 15 working 
days of receipt of such a request from EPA, the State shall submit two 
copies of the requested data.
    (i) Federal Register publication. The Administrator shall publish in 
the Federal Register, on a regular basis, a summary of all State 
registrations made under sec. 24(c) during a previous reporting period 
established by the Administrator. For each product or use registered, 
the notice shall indicate:
    (1) The name of the product.
    (2) The name of the registrant.
    (3) The registered use(s) of the product.
    (4) The effective date of the State registration.
    (5) If the registration is for an additional use of a federally 
registered product, whether the State registration involves a changed 
use pattern.
    (j) Electronic reporting under State registration of pesticide 
products for special local needs. States that choose to receive 
electronic documents under the regulations pertaining to state 
registration of pesticides to meet special local needs, must ensure that 
the requirements of 40 CFR Part 3--(Electronic reporting) are satisfied 
by their state procedures for such registrations.

<R05>
Sec. 162.154  Disapproval of State registrations.

    (a) General disapprovals. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of 
this section, the Administrator may disapprove, on any reasonable 
grounds, any state registration which, when compared to a federally 
registered product, does not have both a similar composition and a 
similar use pattern; provided that the Administrator may not disapprove 
such a registration solely because of a lack of essentiality. Grounds 
for disapproval of State registrations not involving similar products 
may include, but are not limited to:
    (i) Probable creation of unreasonable adverse effects on man or the 
environment by the registered use.
    (ii) Refusal of the registering State to submit information 
supporting the registration as required by Sec. 162.153(h).

[[Page 238]]

    (iii) Failure of information submitted by the State to support the 
State's decision to issue the registration under standards established 
by Sec. 162.153.
    (2) Prior to disapproval of any State registration under this 
paragraph, the Administrator shall notify the registering State, in 
writing, of the Administrator's intent to disapprove, and of the reasons 
for disapproval. The notice of intent will provide a reasonable time, 
not less than ten days from the date the notice is received by the 
State, for the State to respond, and will invite the State to consult 
with the Administrator or his designee. If the grounds for disapproval 
are based on actions or omissions by the State, the notice will, if 
possible, also provide the State with a reasonable amount of time in 
which to take corrective action, not to exceed the time allowed for 
disapproval under paragraph (c) of this section.
    (3) The registering State may, within ten days of receipt of a 
notice of intent to disapprove, request that the Administrator, or his 
designee, consult with appropriate State officials prior to the 
Administrator's final decision on disapproval. The Administrator will 
consider any relevant information presented at such a consultation, or 
in any other timely and appropriate fashion, in deciding whether to 
withdraw the notice of intent to disapprove.
    (b) Special disapprovals. (1) The Administrator may disapprove any 
State registration, including a registration for a similar product, at 
any time, if the Administrator determines that use of the product under 
the State registration:
    (i) Would constitute an imminent hazard.
    (ii) May result in a residue on food or feed exceeding, or not 
covered by, a tolerance, exemption, or other clearance under the Federal 
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 346a et seq.).
    (2) If the Administrator disapproves a registration under this 
paragraph, the Administrator shall provide the registering State with 
written notification of disapproval, in accordance with paragraph (c) of 
this section, as soon thereafter as practicable. Such notification will 
specify the grounds for disapproval and invite the State to comment on 
the decision.
    (3) If requested by the State within ten days of its receipt of a 
notice of disapproval, the Administrator, or his designee, will consult 
with appropriate State officials. The Administrator may consider any 
information presented at such a consultation, or in any other 
appropriate fashion, in determining whether the disapproval should be 
rescinded.
    (c) Decision and notification of disapproval. Except as provided in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Administrator will make a final 
decision on disapproval of a State registration, and provide written 
notification thereof to the State, within 90 days of the effective date 
of the registration; provided that, if the State does not notify the 
Agency of a registration within ten days of its effective date, then the 
Administrator will make a final decision on disapproval within 90 days 
of the date on which EPA receives notification of the State 
registration. The notice of disapproval will specify an appropriate date 
on which the disapproval will become effective. Disapproval may become 
effective immediately, or at anytime within the period allowed for the 
Administrator to make a final decision on disapproval. The notice of 
disapproval will also, when appropriate, give instructions for use or 
disposal of the pesticide. Each notice of disapproval will be published 
in the Federal Register.
    (d) Effect of disapproval. If a registration issued by a State is 
disapproved by the Administrator, that registration will not be valid 
for any purpose under FIFRA, as of the date the disapproval becomes 
effective. Thereafter, distribution or sale of the pesticide, in either 
interstate or intrastate commerce, for uses subject to the disapproval 
will be a violation of sec. 12(a)(1) of FIFRA.
    (e) Rescission of disapproval. If the Administrator determines, 
after consultation with the State lead agency, that a registration, 
previously issued by the State and disapproved by the Administrator, 
should not have been disapproved under FIFRA, then the Administrator 
shall rescind the disapproval. The Administrator shall send written 
notification of the rescission to

[[Page 239]]

the State. In addition, the Administrator shall publish notice of any 
rescission of disapproval in the Federal Register.
    (f) Notification of registrants. Any State that issues a 
registration which has been disapproved, or which is subject to a notice 
of intent to disapprove, shall be responsible for notifying the affected 
registrant of any such notice of intent or disapproval, and of any 
recession of disapproval by the Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 162.155  Suspension of State registration authority.

    (a) General. (1) If the Administrator finds that a State is not 
capable of exercising, or has failed to exercise, adequate control over 
its registration program, so that the State cannot ensure that 
registrations issued by it will be in accord with the purposes of FIFRA, 
then the Administrator may suspend the State's authority to register 
pesticides under sec. 24(c) of the Act. Registrations issued by the 
State after suspension of its authority will not be considered valid 
under FIFRA. Registrations issued by the State prior to suspension will 
not be affected by the suspension.
    (2) The Administrator may suspend all or any part of a State's 
registration authority, as appropriate.
    (b) Grounds for suspension. (1) The Administrator may suspend a 
State's registration authority due to lack of, or failure to exercise, 
adequate control by the State over its sec. 24(c) registration program. 
Adequate control includes, but is not limited to, all of the following:
    (i) Access to appropriate scientific and technical personnel to 
review data and make determinations as required by Sec. 162.153.
    (ii) Registration procedures satisfying Sec. 162.153.
    (iii) Complete and accurate records of State registrations.
    (iv) Adequate legal authority. (A) To deny, suspend, revoke, or 
amend a State registration when the registration is not in compliance 
with FIFRA, this subpart, or State law, or when necessary to prevent 
unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.
    (B) To enter, at reasonable times, by consent, warrant, or other 
legal means, any establishment where pesticides are produced or held for 
distribution or sale, to inspect, sample, and observe whether pesticides 
are being produced or distributed in compliance with FIFRA, this 
subpart, State law, and the terms of any State registration.
    (2) The Administrator may suspend a State's registration authority 
if the State fails to exercise the controls specified in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, or if the State refuses to correct within a 
reasonable time any other significant deficiencies in its regulatory 
program, as specified by the Administrator in a notice of intent to 
suspend.
    (c) Procedures for suspension. (1) Prior to suspending the 
registration authority of any State, the Administrator will notify the 
State lead agency, in writing, of the Administrator's intent to suspend, 
and of the specific grounds for suspension. The notice of intent will 
specify whether the suspension will be complete or partial, and will 
provide the State an opportunity to respond and a reasonable amount of 
time, not less than 30 days from the date the notice is received, in 
which to correct the deficiencies specified in the notice. If the State 
does not correct the specified deficiencies within the reasonable time 
allowed by the notice, or if the Administrator has not withdrawn the 
notice of intent before that time, the notice of intent will be 
published in the Federal Register, and the public given an opportunity 
to comment thereon.
    (2) If requested by the affected State lead agency within 30 days of 
receipt of the notice of intent to suspend, an informal consultation 
between appropriate State and EPA officials will be held to discuss the 
proposed suspension. In such a case, the Administrator shall not make a 
final decision on the proposed suspension until after the consultation. 
The Administrator shall consider all relevant information presented at 
the consultation, or in any other appropriate manner, in determining 
whether to suspend the State's authority. If the Administrator 
determines, on the basis of such information, that the deficiencies 
listed in the notice of intent no longer exist, or will

[[Page 240]]

be corrected in a reasonable time, then the Administrator will withdraw, 
in writing, the notice of intent to suspend.
    (3) Within ten days of the date a notice of intent to suspend is 
published in the Federal Register, a State may request a public hearing 
to consider the proposed suspension. If a hearing is requested, the 
Administrator will:
    (i) Schedule a public hearing to be held in that State.
    (ii) Publish in the Federal Register a notice announcing the date, 
time, and location of the hearing.
    (iii) Appoint a presiding officer who shall preside over the 
hearing.
    (iv) Prescribe additional, appropriate procedures for the conduct of 
the hearing, including procedures for the presentation of relevant 
material evidence from the State, EPA, or members of the public who 
would be affected by the outcome of the hearing. Evidence may be 
presented in either oral or written form, at the discretion of the 
Administrator.
    (4) Following the close of any hearing held under paragraph (c)(3) 
of this section, the presiding officer shall make a recommended decision 
that the State's authority to register pesticides under sec. 24(c) of 
FIFRA be suspended, in whole or in part, or that the State's authority 
not be suspended and that the notice of intent to suspend be withdrawn.
    (5) Any recommended decision made by a presiding officer under 
paragraph (c)(4) of this section may be appealed to the Administrator 
within 30 days after its issuance by the State or by EPA. Any 
recommended decision which is not appealed, or which the Administrator 
does not review on his own initiative, will become a final Agency action 
30 days after its issuance.
    (6) If no hearing is requested under paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section, or if a recommended decision is appealed to the Administrator 
under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the Administrator shall issue a 
final order either suspending the State's authority to register 
pesticides under section 24(c) of FIFRA, in whole or in part, or 
withdrawing the notice of intent to suspend.
    (7) Any final order suspending State registration authority, issued 
under paragraph (c) (5) or (6) of this section, will specify the grounds 
therefor and an effective date for the suspension. If the suspension is 
merely partial, the notice of suspension will specify the types of 
registrations which will not be recognized as valid under sec. 24(c). 
All final orders issued under paragraph (c) (5) or (6) will be published 
in the Federal Register.
    (d) Termination of suspension. Suspension of a State's authority 
will be effective for the period specified in the notice of suspension, 
or if no period was specified, until such time as the Administrator is 
satisfied that the State can and will exercise adequate control over its 
program. In the latter case, the Administrator will notify the State 
that the suspension is terminated, or that it will be terminated on a 
specific date. In either case, the Administrator will publish a notice 
of the termination of suspension in the Federal Register.
    (e) Judicial review. Any State whose authority to register

supplementary thereto and amendatory thereof.
    (b) The term Administrative Law Judge means an Administrative Law 
Judge appointed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 3105 (see also 5 CFR part 930, as 
amended), and such term is synonymous with the term ``Hearing Examiner'' 
as used in the Act or in the United States Code.

States Environmental Protection Agency.
    (d) The term Agency, unless otherwise specified, means the United

Agency described in Sec. 1.25 of this title. The Administrator 
delegates authority to the Environmental Appeals Board to issue final 
decisions in appeals filed under subparts B and C of this part. An 
appeal directed to the Administrator, rather than to the Environmental 
Appeals Board, will not be considered. This delegation does not preclude 
the Environmental Appeals Board from referring an appeal or a motion 
under subparts B and C to the Administrator when the Environmental 
Appeals Board, in its discretion, deems it appropriate to do so. When an 
appeal or motion is referred to the Administrator, all of the parties 
shall be so notified and the rules in subparts B and C referring to the 
Environmental Appeals Board shall be interpreted as referring to the 
Administrator.
    (h) The term Expedited Hearing means a hearing commenced as the 
result of the issuance of a notice of intention to suspend or the 
suspension of a registration of a pesticide by an emergency order, and 
is limited to a consideration as to whether a pesticide presents an

therefrom is taken or the Administrator orders review thereof as herein 
provided.
    (l) The term Judicial Officer means an officer or employee of the 
Agency designated as a judicial officer, pursuant to these rules, who 
shall meet the qualifications and perform functions as herein provided.
    (1) Office. There may be designated for the Agency one or more 
judicial officers, one of whom may be Chief Judicial Officer. As work

shall stay in force until further notice.
    (2) Qualification. A judicial officer shall be a permanent or 
temporary employee or officer of the Agency who may perform other duties

connection with the preparation or presentation of evidence for a 
hearing.
    (3) Functions. The Administrator may delegate any or part of his 
authority to act in a given case under subparts B and C of this part to 
a judicial officer. The Administrator can separately delegate his 
authority to rule on interlocutory orders and motions, and may also 
delegate his authority to make findings of fact and draw conclusions of 
law in a particular proceeding, providing that this delegation shall not 
preclude the Judicial Officer from referring any motion or case to the 
Administrator when the Judicial Officer determines such referral to be 
appropriate. The Administrator, in deciding a case himself, may consult 
with and assign the preliminary drafting of conclusions of law and 
findings of fact to any judicial officer.
    (m) The term Party means any person, group, organization, or Federal 
agency or department that participates in a hearing.
    (n) The term Person includes any individual, partnership, 
association, corporation, and any organized group of persons, whether 
incorporated or not.

notice of the Administrator who requests a public hearing.
    (p) The term Presiding Officer means any person designated by the 
Administrator to conduct an expedited hearing.
    (q) The term Recommended Decision means the recommended findings and 
conclusions of the Presiding Officer in an expedited hearing.
    (r) The term Registrant means any person who has registered a 
pesticide pursuant to the provisions of the Act.

a trade secret or commercial or financial information, other than 
information relating to the formulas of a pesticide, the Administrative 
Law Judge, the Presiding Officer, or the Environmental Appeals Board may 
require production or testimony in camera and sealed to all but the 
parties.

the clerk, it shall serve upon all other parties copies thereof, with a 
certificate of service on each document or paper, including those filed 
with the hearing clerk. If filing is accomplished by mail addressed to 
the clerk, filing shall be deemed timely if the papers are postmarked on 
the due date except as to initial filings requesting a public hearing or 
responding to a notice of intent to hold a hearing, in which case such 
filings must be received by the hearing clerk either within the time 
required by statute or by the notice of intent to hold a hearing.

<R05>
Sec. 164.6  Time.

    (a) Computation. In computing any period of time prescribed or 
allowed by these rules, except as otherwise provided, the day of the 
act, event, or default from which the designated period of time begins 
to run shall not be included. Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays 
shall be included in computing the time allowed for the filing of any 
document or paper, except that when such time expires on a Saturday, 
Sunday, or legal holiday, such period shall be extended to include the 
next following business day.
    (b) Enlargement. When by these rules or by order of the

if request therefor, which may be made ex parte, is made before the 
expiration of the period originally prescribed or as extended by a 
previous order; or on motion made after the expiration of the specified 
period, permit the act to be done where the failure to act was the 
result of excusable neglect. In this connection, consideration shall be 
given to the fact that, under the provisions of the act, the

completion of the hearing, unless all parties agree by stipulation to 
extend this period of time pursuant to Sec. 164.103.

time within which a party is required or permitted to do an act shall be 
computed from the time of service, except that when the service is made 
by mail, 3 days shall be added to the prescribed period. Such addition 
for service by mail shall not apply in the case of filing initial

investigative or expert capacity, or with any representative of such 
person, Provided, That the Environmental Appeals Board, the Presiding 
Officer, or the Administrative Law Judge may discuss the merits of the

representatives, have been given reasonable notice and opportunity to be 
present. Any memorandum or other communication addressed to the 
Administrator, the Environmental Appeals Board, the Presiding Officer, 
or the Administrative Law Judge during the pendency of the proceeding,

Sec. 164.20  Commencement of proceeding.

    (a) A proceeding shall be commenced whenever a hearing is requested

by the reasons (including the factual basis) for the action.
    (b) Amendments to contents of denials and notices. Such documents 
under this section may be amended or enlarged by the Administrator at 
any time prior to the commencement of the public hearing. If the 
Administrative Law Judge determines that additional time is necessary to

commencement of the hearing shall be delayed for an appropriate period.


<R05>
Sec. 164.22  Contents of document setting forth objections.

    (a) Concise statement required. Any document containing objections 
to an order of the Administrator of his refusal to register, or his 
intent to cancel the registration, or change the classification of a 
pesticide, shall clearly and concisely set forth such objections and the 
basis for each objection, including relevant allegations of fact 
concerning the pesticide under consideration. The document shall 
indicate the registration number of the pesticide, if applicable, a copy 
of the currently accepted and/or proposed labeling and a list of the 
currently registered or proposed uses of said pesticide.
    (b) Amendments to objections byleave. Objections may be amended at 
any time prior to the commencement of the public hearing by leave of the 
Administrative Law Judge or by written consent of all parties. The 
Administrative Law Judge shall freely grant such leave when justice so 
requires. If the Administrative Law Judge determines that additional 
time is necessary to permit a party to prepare for matters raised by 
amendments to objections, the commencement of the hearing shall be 
delayed for an appropriate period. This subsection shall not permit the 
addition, beyond the statutory deadline, of registered pesticides which 
are not included in the objections filed pursuant to paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (c) Amendments to objections as a matter of right. Objections may be 
amended as a matter of right within 30 days, or in such time as the 
Administrator shall designate, after the Administrator amends his notice 
of intent to cancel a registration, change a classification, or his 
refusal to register a pesticide.


<R05>
Sec. 164.23  Contents of the statement of issues to accompany notice of intent to hold a hearing.

    (a) Concise statement required. The statement of issues by the 
Administrator shall set a time in which any person wishing to 
participate in the hearing shall file a written response to the 
statement of issues as provided by Sec. 164.24. The statement of issues 
shall include questions as to which evidence shall be taken at the 
hearing. Those questions may include questions concerning whether a 
pesticide's registration should be canceled or its classification 
changed, whether its composition is such as to warrant the claims for 
it, whether its labeling and other material submitted comply with the 
requirements of the Act, whether it will perform its intended function 
without unreasonable adverse effects on the environment, and whether, 
when used in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized 
practice, it will or will not generally cause unreasonable adverse 
effects on the environment.

[[Page 247]]

    (b) Amendment to statement of issues. The statement of issues may be 
amended or enlarged by the Administrator at any time prior to the 
commencement of the public hearing. If the Administrative Law Judge 
determines that additional time is necessary to permit a party to 
prepare for matters raised by amendments or enlargements to the 
statement of issues, the commencement of the hearing shall be delayed 
for an appropriate period.


<R05>
Sec. 164.24  Response to the Administrator's notice of intention to hold a hearing.

    Any person wishing to participate in any proceeding commenced 
pursuant to any notice by the Administrator of intention to hold a 
hearing, shall file with the hearing clerk, within the time set by the 
Administrator in the notice (in no case less than 30 days from the date 
of the notice), a written response to the statement of issues which 
shall include the position and interest of such person with respect 
thereto. If any such person is a registrant or an applicant for 
registration, he shall also file the registration number of the 
pesticide, if applicable, a copy of the currently accepted and/or 
proposed labeling and a list of the currently registered or proposed 
uses of said pesticide.


<R05>
Sec. 164.25  Filing copies of notification of intent to cancel registration

or change classification or refusal to register, and statement of issues.

requesting a public hearing is filed with the hearing clerk or a 
response to the statement of issues is filed, the hearing clerk shall 
serve a copy of the document upon Respondent and the Office of the 
General Counsel of the Agency, Respondent shall, by counsel, thereupon 
file with the hearing clerk a copy of the appropriate notice of

<R05>
Sec. 164.30  Appearances.

hearing conducted under this subpart. A motion must set forth the 
grounds for the proposed intervention, the position and interest of the 
movant in the proceeding and the documents proposed to be filed pursuant 
to either Sec. 164.22 or Sec. 164.24.
    (b) When filed. A motion for leave to intervene in a hearing must 
ordinarily be filed prior to the commencement of the first prehearing 
conference. Any motion filed after that time must contain, in addition 
to the information set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, a 
statement of good cause for the failure to file the motion prior to the 
commencement of the first prehearing conference, and shall be granted 
only upon a finding (1) that extraordinary circumstances justify the 
granting of the motion, or (2) that the intervenor shall be bound by 
agreements, arrangements, and other matters previously made in the 
proceeding.
    (c) Disposition. Leave to intervene will be freely granted but only 
insofar as such leave raises matters which are pertinent to and do not 
unreasonably broaden the issues already presented. If leave is granted, 
the movant shall thereby become a party with the full status of the 
original parties to the proceedings. If leave is denied, the movant may 
request that the ruling be certified to the Environmental Appeals Board, 
pursuant to Sec. 164.100 for a speedy appeal.
    (d) Amicus curiae. Persons not parties to the proceedings wishing to 
file briefs may do so by leave of the Administrative Law Judge granted

brief is desirable. Unless all parties otherwise consent, an amicus 
curiae shall file its brief within the time allowed the party whose 
position the brief will support. Upon a showing of good cause, the 
Administrator or Administrative Law Judge may grant permission for later 
filing.

Sec. 164.32  Consolidation.

    The Chief Administrative Law Judge, by motion or sua sponte, may 
consolidate two or more proceedings whenever it appears that this will 
expedite or simplify consideration of the issues. Consolidation shall 
not affect the right of any party to raise issues that could have been 
raised if consolidation had not occurred. At the conclusion of 
proceedings consolidated under this section, the Administrative Law 
Judge shall issue one decision under Sec. 164.90 unless one or more of 
the consolidated proceedings have been dismissed pursuant to Sec. 
164.91.

                        Administrative Law Judge


<R05>
Sec. 164.40  Qualifications and duties of Administrative Law Judge.

    (a) Qualifications. The Administrative Law Judge shall have the 
qualifications required by statute. He shall not decide any matter in 
connection with a proceeding where he has a financial interest in any of 
the parties or a relationship with a party that would make it otherwise 
inappropriate for him to act.
    (b) Disqualification of the Administrative Law Judge. (1) Any party 
may, by motion made to the Administrative Law Judge, as soon as 
practicable, request that he disqualify himself and withdraw from the 
proceeding. The Administrative Law Judge shall then rule upon the motion 
and, upon request of the movant, shall certify an adverse ruling for 
appeal.
    (2) Withdrawal sua sponte. The Administrative Law Judge may at any 
time withdraw from any proceedings in which he deems himself 
disqualified for any reason.
    (c) Conduct. The Administrative Law Judge shall conduct the 
proceeding in a fair and impartial manner subject to the precepts of the 
Canons of Judicial Ethics of the American Bar Association.
    (d) Power. Subject to review, as provided elsewhere in this part, 
the Administrative Law Judge shall have power to take actions and 
decisions in conformity with statute or in the interests of justice. The 
Administrative Law Judge shall not interrupt the recording of the 
proceedings on the record over the objection of any party.
    (e) Absence or change of the Administrative Law Judge. In the case 
of the absence or unavailability of the Administrative Law Judge, or his 
inability to act, or his removal by disqualification or withdrawal, the 
powers and duties to be performed by him under this part in connection 
with a hearing assigned to him may, unless otherwise directed by the 
Administrator, be assigned to another Administrative Law Judge so 
designated to act by the Chief Administrative Law Judge, the 
Administrator or the Environmental Appeals Board.

                   Prehearing Procedures and Discovery


<R05>
Sec. 164.50  Prehearing conference and primary discovery.

    (a) Purpose of the prehearing conference. Except as otherwise 
provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the Administrative Law Judge 
shall, prior to the commencement of the hearing and for the purpose of 
expediting the hearing, file with the hearing clerk an order for a 
prehearing conference. More than one such conference may be held. Such 
order or orders shall direct the parties or their counsel to appear at a 
specified time and place to consider:
    (1) The simplification of issues including listing of specific uses 
to be contested;
    (2) The necessity or desirability of amendments to the objections or 
statement of issues, or any document filed in response thereto;
    (3) The possibility of obtaining stipulations of fact and documents 
which will avoid unnecessary delay;
    (4) Matters of which official notice may be taken;

[[Page 249]]

    (5) The limitation of the number of expert and other witnesses;
    (6) Procedure at the hearing except as so provided in Sec. 
164.80(a);
    (7) The use of verified written statements in lieu of oral direct 
testimony;
    (8) The intent of any party to request a scientific advisory 
committee as defined in Sec. 164.2(f);
    (9) The issuance of subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum for 
discovery and hearing purposes;
    (10) A setting of a time and place for the public hearing, after 
giving careful consideration to the convenience of all the parties, the 
witnesses, the public interest and the necessity for notice in the 
Federal Register as provided by Sec. 164.8; and
    (11) Any other matter that may expedite the hearing or aid in the 
disposition of the proceeding.
    (b) Primary discovery (Exchange of witness lists and documents). At 
a prehearing conference or within some reasonable time set by the 
Administrative Law Judge prior to the hearing, each party shall make 
available to the other parties the names of the expert and other 
witnesses the party expects to call, together with a brief narrative 
summary of their expected testimony and a list of all documents and 
exhibits which the party expects to introduce into evidence. Thereafter, 
witnesses, documents, or exhibits may be added and narrative summaries 
of expected testimony amended upon motion by a party.
    (c) Record of the prehearing conference. No transcript of any 
prehearing conference shall be made unless a request therefor by one of 
the parties is granted by the Administrative Law Judge. Such party shall 
bear the cost of the taking of the transcript unless otherwise ordered 
by the Administrative Law Judge. The Administrative Law Judge shall 
prepare and file for the record a written report of the action taken at 
each conference, which shall incorporate any stipulations or agreements 
made by the parties at or as a result of such conference, all rulings 
upon matters considered at such conference and appropriate orders.
    (d) Unavailability of a prehearing conference. Upon a finding that 
circumstances render a prehearing conference unnecessary, or 
impracticable, or upon a finding that a prehearing conference would 
serve primarily to delay the proceedings rather than to expedite them, 
the Administrative Law Judge, on motion or sua sponte, may order that 
the prehearing conference not be held. In these circumstances he may 
request the parties to correspond with him for the purpose of 
accomplishing any of the objectives set forth in this section. Such 
correspondence shall not be made a part of the record, but the 
Administrative Law Judge shall submit a written summary for the record 
if any action is taken.
    (e) Submission of questions to an advisory committee--(1) General. 
At any prehearing conference, or if none is held prior to the public 
hearing, except as herein provided, the Administrative Law Judge shall 
determine whether any party desires that questions of scientific fact be 
referred to a committee designated by the National Academy of Sciences.
    (2) Preparation of questions. On determining an affirmative intent, 
the Administrative Law Judge shall direct all parties to file and serve, 
within a time period subject to his discretion, proposed questions of 
scientific fact accompanied by reasons supporting their submission to 
said committee. Within 10 days of the service of such proposed 
questions, together with their supporting reasons, any party may respond 
in writing to the proposed submission of the questions to the said 
committee. The Administrative Law Judge shall determine whether or not a 
reference of questions of scientific fact to said committee is necessary 
or desirable. In the event he decides such reference is necessary or 
desirable, he shall so inform the National Academy in writing, and shall 
prepare in his discretion appropriate questions. If any of the questions 
prepared are not in substance based upon the submissions of the parties, 
the Administrative Law Judge shall permit any party 10 days after their 
preparation to respond in writing to the proposed submission of said 
question or questions. He shall then determine whether such questions 
should be referred to the committee.

[[Page 250]]

    (3) Reference and report. Not less than 30 days after he has 
informed the National Academy that questions of scientific fact will be 
referred to it, the Administrative Law Judge shall refer the questions 
of scientific fact as prepared. The committee shall report in writing to 
the Administrative Law Judge within 60 days after such referral on these 
questions of scientific fact and the report, its record and any other 
matter transmitted as provided for by the Administrator's agreement with 
the National Academy of Sciences shall be made public and considered as 
part of the hearing record.
    (4) Request and submission subsequent to prehearing conference. At 
any time before the hearing is closed, the Administrative Law Judge or a 
party by motion may request that questions of scientific fact not 
previously referred be referred, or that questions previously referred 
be amended or expanded. The Administrative Law Judge may refer such 
questions if he finds that good cause exists and that reference of such 
questions is necessary or desirable.

<R05>
Sec. 164.51  Other discovery.

    (a) General. Except as so provided by Sec. 164.50(b) supra, further 
discovery, under this subpart, shall be permitted only upon 
determination by the Administrative Law Judge (1) that such discovery 
shall not in any way unreasonably delay the proceeding, (2) that the 
information to be obtained is not otherwise obtainable and (3) that such 
information has significant probative value. The Administrative Law 
Judge shall be guided by the procedures set forth in the Federal Rules 
of Civil Procedure, where practicable, and the precedents thereunder, 
except that no discovery shall be undertaken except upon order of the 
Administrative Law Judge or upon agreement of the parties.
    (b) Depositions upon oral questions. The Administrative Law Judge 
shall order depositions upon oral questions only upon a showing of good 
cause and upon a finding that (1) the information sought cannot be 
obtained by alternative methods, or (2) there is a substantial reason to 
believe that relevant and probative evidence may otherwise not be 
preserved for presentation by a witness at the hearing.
    (c) Procedure. (1) Any party to the proceeding desiring discovery 
shall make a motion or motions therefor. Such a motion shall set forth 
(i) the circumstances warranting the taking of the discovery, (ii) the 
nature of the information expected to be discovered and (iii) the 
proposed time and place where it will be taken.
    (2) If the Administrative Law Judge determines the motion should be 
granted, he shall issue an order and appropriate subpoenas, if 
necessary, for the taking of such discovery together with the conditions 
and terms thereof.

                                 Motions


<R05>
Sec. 164.60  Motions.

    (a) General. All motions, except those made orally during the course 
of a public hearing or as otherwise provided by this part, shall be in 
writing and shall state with particularity the grounds therefor, shall 
set forth the relief or order sought, and shall be filed with the 
hearing clerk and served on all parties.
    (b) Response to motions. Within 10 days after service of any motion 
filed pursuant to this part, or within such other time as may be fixed 
by the Administrator, his designee, or the Administrative Law Judge, any 
party may serve and file an answer to the motion. The movant shall, if 
requested by the Administrator, his designee, or the Administrative Law 
Judge, serve and file reply papers within the time set by the request.
    (c) Decision. The Administrative Law Judge shall rule upon all 
motions filed or made prior to the filing of his initial or accelerated 
decision at the time of filing on ex parte motions or where the movant 
has stated that no party objects to the granting of such motion. 
Otherwise, such decision shall await the answering papers and reply 
papers if permitted. The Environmental Appeals Board shall rule upon all 
motions filed after the filing of the initial or accelerated decision. 
Oral argument of motions will be permitted only if the

[[Page 251]]

Administrative Law Judge or the Environmental Appeals Board deems it 
necessary.

                       Subpoenas and Witness Fees


<R05>
Sec. 164.70  Subpoenas.

    (a) The attendance of witnesses or the production of documentary 
evidence may, by subpoena, be required at any designated place of 
hearing or place of discovery. Subpoenas may be issued by the 
Administrative Law Judge sua sponte or upon a showing by an applicant 
that evidence sought for hearing is relevant and material to the issues 
involved in the hearing or that the sought discovery pursuant to Sec. 
164.51 meets the standards set forth therein. The Administrative Law 
Judge shall be guided by the principles of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure in making any order for the protection of a witness or the 
content of the documents produced.
    (b) Motion for subpoena duces tecum. Subpoenas for the production of 
documentary evidence, unless issued by the Administrative Law Judge sua 
sponte, shall be issued only upon a written motion. Such motion shall 
specify, as exactly as possible, the documents desired.
    (c) Service of subpoenas. Subpoenas shall be served as provided by 
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.


<R05>
Sec. 164.71  Fees of witnesses.

    Witnesses summoned before the Administrative Law Judge shall be paid 
the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of the 
United States, and persons whose depositions are taken, and the persons 
taking the same, shall be entitled to the same fees as are paid for like 
services in the courts of the United States. Fees shall be paid by the 
party at whose instance the witness appears or the deposition is taken.

                              The Hearings


<R05>
Sec. 164.80  Order of proceeding and burden of proof.

    (a) At the hearing, the proponent of cancellation or change in 
classification has the burden of going forward to present an affirmative 
case for the cancellation or change in classification of the 
registration. In the case of the denial of an application for 
registration, the applicant shall have the burden of going forward. In 
the case of a hearing called by the Administrator, the Respondent has 
the burden of going forward to present an affirmative case as to the 
statement of issues. The party having the burden of going forward shall 
have the opportunity to submit evidence on rebuttal.
    (b) On all issues arising in connection with the hearing, the 
ultimate burden of persuasion shall rest with the proponent of the 
registration.
    (c) If any party, other than Respondent, after being duly notified, 
fails to appear at the hearing, he shall be deemed to have authorized 
the Administrative Law Judge to dismiss the proceeding with or without 
prejudice, as the Administrative Law Judge may determine, unless a 
motion excusing the failure to appear has been made and granted. In the 
event that a party appears at the hearing and no representative of the 
Agency appears, the Administrative Law Judge shall proceed ex parte to 
hear the evidence of the party: Provided, That failure on the part of 
Respondent to appear at a hearing shall not be deemed to be a waiver of 
Respondent's right to file proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law 
and orders, to be served with a copy of the Administrative Law Judge's 
initial or accelerated decision, and to file exceptions with and to 
submit argument before the Administrator with respect thereto.


<R05>
Sec. 164.81  Evidence.

    (a) General. The Administrative Law Judge shall admit all relevant, 
competent and material evidence, except evidence that is unduly 
repetitious. Relevant, competent and material evidence may be received 
at any hearing even though inadmissible under the rules of evidence 
applicable to judicial proceedings. The weight to be given evidence 
shall be determined by its reliability and probative value. In all 
hearings the testimony of witnesses shall be taken orally, except as 
otherwise provided by these rules or by the

[[Page 252]]

Administrative Law Judge. Parties, however, shall have the right to 
cross-examine a witness who appears at the hearing, provided that such 
cross examination is not unduly repetitious.
    (b) Report of a committee of the National Academy of Sciences. If 
questions have been submitted to a committee designated by the National 
Academy pursuant to Sec. 164.50(e), the report of the committee, other 
material that may be required by the Administrator and a list of 
witnesses and evidence relied upon shall be received into evidence and 
made part of the record of the hearing. Objections to the report may 
also be made part of the record and go to the weight of its evidentiary 
value.
    (c) Objections. If a party objects to the admission or rejection of 
any evidence or the limitation of the scope of any examination or cross-
examination, he shall state briefly the grounds for such objection. The 
transcript shall include any argument or debate thereon, unless the 
Administrative Law Judge, with the consent of all parties, orders that 
such argument not be transcribed. The ruling and the reasons given 
therefor by the Administrative Law Judge on any objection shall be a 
part of the transcript. An automatic exception to that ruling will 
follow.
    (d) Exhibits. Except where the Administrative Law Judge finds that 
the furnishing of copies is impracticable, a copy of each exhibit filed 
with the Administrative Law Judge shall be furnished to each other 
party. A true copy of an exhibit may, in the discretion of the 
Administrative Law Judge, be substituted for the original.
    (e) Official Notice. Official notice may be taken of Agency 
proceedings, any matter judicially noticed in the Federal courts, and of 
other facts within the specialized knowledge and experience of the 
Agency. Any active party shall be given adequate opportunity to show 
that such facts are erroneously noticed by presenting evidence to the 
contrary.
    (f) Offer of proof. Whenever evidence is deemed inadmissible, the 
party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall be 
included in the transcript. The offer of proof for excluded oral 
testimony shall consist of a brief statement describing the nature of 
the evidence excluded. If the evidence consists of a document or 
exhibit, it shall be inserted in the record in total. In the event the 
Environmental Appeals Board decides that the Administrative Law Judge's 
ruling in excluding the evidence was erroneous and prejudicial, the 
hearings may be reopened to permit the taking of such evidence, or where 
appropriate, the Environmental Appeals Board may evaluate the evidence 
and proceed to a final decision.
    (g) Verified statements. With the approval of the Administrative Law 
Judge, a witness may insert into the record, as his testimony, 
statements of fact or opinion prepared by him or written answers to 
interrogatories of counsel, or may submit as an exhibit his prepared 
statement, provided that such statements or answers must not include 
legal argument. Before any such statement or answer is read or admitted 
into evidence the witness shall deliver to the Administrative Law Judge, 
the reporter, and opposing counsel a copy of such. The admissibility of 
the evidence contained in such statement shall be subject to the same 
rules as if such testimony were produced in the usual manner and the 
witness shall be subject to oral cross-examination on the contents of 
such statements. Approval for such a procedure may be denied when it 
appears to the Administrative Law Judge that the memory or the demeanor 
of the witness is of importance.

<R05>
Sec. 164.82  Transcripts.

    (a) Filing and certification. Hearings shall be stenographically 
reported, transcribed and made available to the public as required by 
statute or Agency regulations. As soon as practicable after the taking 
of the last evidence, the Administrative Law Judge shall certify (1) 
that the original transcript is a true transcript of the testimony 
offered or received at the hearing, except in such particulars as he 
shall specify and (2) that the exhibits accompanying the transcript are 
all the exhibits introduced at the hearing, with such exceptions as he 
shall specify. A copy of

[[Page 253]]

such certificate shall be attached to each of the copies of the 
transcript.
    (b) [Reserved]

                     Initial or Accelerated Decision


<R05>
Sec. 164.90  Initial decision.

    (a) Proposed findings of fact, conclusions, and order. Within 20 
days after the last evidence is taken in a hearing, each party may file 
with the hearing clerk proposed orders, findings of fact, and 
conclusions of law based solely on the record, and a brief in support 
thereof. Within 10 days thereafter, each party may file a reply brief. 
The Administrative Law Judge may, in his discretion, extend the total 
time period for filing any proposed findings, conclusions, orders or 
briefs for an additional 30 days. In such instances, briefs and replies 
shall be due at such time as the Administrative Law Judge may fix by 
order. The hearing shall be deemed closed at the conclusion of the 
briefing period.
    (b) Initial decision. The Administrative Law Judge, within 25 days 
after the close of the hearing, shall evaluate the record before him, 
and prepare and file his initial decision with the hearing clerk. A copy 
of the initial decision shall be served upon each of the parties, and 
the hearing clerk shall immediately transmit a copy to the Environmental 
Appeals Board. The initial decision shall become the decision of the 
Environmental Appeals Board without further proceedings unless an appeal 
is taken from it or the Environmental Appeals Board orders review of it, 
pursuant to Sec. 164.101.

<R05>
Sec. 164.91  Accelerated decision.

    (a) General. The Administrative Law Judge, in his discretion, may at 
any time render an accelerated decision in favor of Respondent as to all 
or any portion of the proceeding, including dismissal without further 
hearing or upon such limited additional evidence such as affidavits as 
he may receive, under any of the following conditions:
    (1) Untimely or insufficient objections filed pursuant to Sec. 
164.20;
    (2) Failure to comply with discovery orders;
    (3) Failure to comply with prehearing orders;
    (4) Failure to appear or to proceed at prehearing conferences;
    (5) Failure to appear at the hearing;
    (6) Failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, or 
direct or collateral estoppel.
    (7) Theat there is no genuine issue of any material fact and that 
the respondent is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; or
    (8) Such other and further reasons as are just.
    (b) Effect. A decision rendered under this section shall have the 
same force and effect as an initial decision entered under Sec. 164.90.

                                 Appeals


<R05>
Sec. 164.100  Appeals from or review of interlocutory orders or rulings.

    Except as provided herein, appeals as a matter of right shall lie to 
the Environmental Appeals Board only from an initial or accelerated 
decision of the Administrative Law Judge. Appeals from other orders or 
rulings shall, except as provided in this section, lie only if the 
Administrative Law Judge certifies such orders or rulings for appeal, or 
otherwise as provided. The Administrative Law Judge may certify an order 
or ruling for appeal to the Environmental Appeals Board when: (a) The 
order or ruling involves an important question of law or policy about 
which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion; and (b) 
either (1) an immediate appeal from the order and ruling will materially 
advance the ultimate termination of the proceeding or (2) review after 
the final judgment is issued will be inadequate or ineffective. The 
Administrative Law Judge shall certify orders or rulings for appeal only 
upon the request of a party. If the Environmental Appeals Board 
determines that certification was improvidently granted, or takes no 
action within thirty (30) days of the certification, the appeal shall be 
deemed dismissed. When an order or ruling is not certified by the 
Administrative Law Judge, it shall be reviewed by the Environmental 
Appeals Board only upon appeal from the initial or accelerated decision 
except when the Environmental Appeals

[[Page 254]]

Board determines, upon request of a party and in exceptional 
circumstances, that delaying review would be deleterious to vital public 
or private interests. Except in extraordinary circumstances proceedings 
will not be stayed pending an interlocutory appeal; where a stay is 
granted, a stay of more than 30 days must be approved by the 
Environmental Appeals Board. Ordinarily, the interlocutory appeal will 
be decided on the basis of the submission made to the Administrative Law 
Judge, but the Environmental Appeals Board may allow further briefs and 
oral argument.

[57 FR 5343, Feb. 13, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 164.101  Appeals from or review of initial decisions.

    (a) Exceptions and request for oral argument. (1) Within 20 days 
after the filing of the Administrative Law Judge's initial decision, 
each party may take exception to any matter set forth in such decision 
or to any adverse order or ruling to which he objected during the 
hearing and may appeal such exceptions to the Environmental Appeals 
Board for decision by filing them in writing with the hearing clerk, 
including a section containing proposed findings of fact, conclusions, 
orders, or rulings. Within the same period of time each party filing 
exceptions and amicus curiae shall file with the hearing clerk a brief 
concerning each of the exceptions being appealed. The party shall 
include, in its brief, page references to the relevant portions of the 
record and to the Administrative Law Judge's initial decision.
    (2) Within 7 days of the service of exceptions, and of a brief under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, any other party or amicus curiae may 
file and serve a brief responding to exceptions or arguments raised by 
any other party. Such brief shall include references to the relevant 
portions of the record. Such brief shall not, however, raise additional 
exceptions.
    (3) Five copies of all material filed under this section shall be 
filed with the hearing clerk.
    (b) Review by Administrator when no exceptions are filed. If no 
exceptions are filed within the time provided, the hearing clerk shall 
notify the Administrator 30 days from the date of filing of the 
Administrative Law Judge's initial decision. Within 10 days after said 
notification, the Environmental Appeals Board shall issue an order 
either declining review of the initial decision or expressing its intent 
to review said initial decision. Such order may include a statement of 
issues to be briefed by the parties and a time schedule concerning 
service and filing of briefs adequate to allow the Environmental Appeals 
Board to issue a final order within 90 days from the close of the 
hearing.
    (c) Argument before the Environmental Appeals Board. (1) A party, if 
he files exceptions and a brief, shall state in writing whether he 
desires to make an oral argument thereon before the Environmental 
Appeals Board; otherwise, he shall be deemed to have waived such oral 
argument. The Environmental Appeals Board shall, however, on its own 
initiative, have the right to set an appeal for oral argument.
    (2) If the Environmental Appeals Board determines that additional 
exceptions should be argued, counsel for the parties shall be given 
reasonable written notice of such determination so as to permit 
preparation of adequate argument on all of the exceptions to be argued.

<R05>
Sec. 164.102  Appeals from accelerated decisions.

    (a) Within 20 days after filing of an accelerated decision by the 
Administrative Law Judge, any party may file exceptions and a supporting 
brief with the hearing clerk, stating with particularity the grounds 
upon which he asserts that the decision is incorrect. The party shall 
include in its brief page references to the relevant portions of the 
record, if applicable.
    (b) Within 7 days of the service of exceptions and brief under 
paragraph (a) of this section, any other party or amicus curiae may file 
and serve a brief responding thereto, with appropriate page references 
to the relevant portions of the record, if applicable.
    (c) Ordinarily, the appeal from an accelerated decision will be 
decided on the basis of the submission of briefs, but the Environmental 
Appeals Board

[[Page 255]]

may allow additional briefs and oral argument.

    Within 90 days after the close of the hearing or within 90 days from 
the filing of an accelerated decision, unless otherwise stipulated by 
the parties, the Environmental Appeals Board shall, on appeal or review 
from an initial or accelerated order of the Administrative Law Judge, 
issue its final decision and order, including its rulings on any 
exceptions filed by the parties; such final order may accept or reject 
all or part of the initial or accelerated decision of the Administrative 
Law Judge even if acceptable to the parties.

Sec. 164.110  Motion for reopening hearings; for rehearing; for reargument

of any proceeding; or for reconsideration of order.

    (a) Filing; service. A motion for reopening the hearing to take 
further evidence, or for rehearing or reargument of any proceeding or 
for reconsideration of the order, must be made by motion to the 
Environmental Appeals Board filed with the hearing clerk. Every such 
motion must state specifically the grounds relied upon.
    (b) Motion to reopen hearings. A motion to reopen a hearing to take 
further evidence may be filed at any time prior to the issuance of the 
Administrator's final order. Every such motion shall state briefly the 
nature and purpose of the evidence to be adduced, shall show that such 
evidence is not merely cumulative, and shall set forth good reason why 
such evidence was not adduced at a hearing.
    (c) Motions to rehear or reargue proceedings, or to reconsider final 
orders. A motion to rehear or reargue the proceeding or to reconsider 
the final order shall be filed within 10 days after the date of service 
of the final order. Every such motion must state specifically the 
matters claimed to have been erroneously decided, and alleged errors 
must be briefly stated. Motions to rehear or reargue proceedings or to 
reconsider final orders shall be directed to, and heard by, the 
Environmental Appeals Board. Motions under this section directed to the 
Administrator will not be considered, except in cases that the

<R05>
Sec. 164.120  Notification.

    (a) Whenever the Administrator determines that action is necessary 
to prevent an imminent hazard during the time required for cancellation 
or change in classification proceedings, but that the hazard does not 
constitute an emergency, he shall notify the registrant of his intention 
to suspend registration of the pesticide at issue.
    (b) Such notice shall include findings pertaining to the question of 
imminent hazard and shall either be personally served on the registrant 
or be sent to the registrant by registered or certified mail, return 
receipt requested, and filed with the hearing clerk.

[[Page 256]]


<R05>
Sec. 164.121  Expedited hearing.

proceeding, for all purposes of its further review.
    (3) When an ``emergency order'' is issued pursuant to Sec. 164.123, 
no person other than the respondent and the registrant shall participate 
in the hearing except that any person adversely affected may file 
proposed findings and conclusions and briefs in support thereof pursuant 
to paragraph (j) of this section. Any person filing under this 
subsection shall be deemed to have been a party to the proceeding for 
all purposes of its further review.
    (f) Appearances and consolidation. The provisions of Sec. Sec. 
164.30 and 164.32 apply to an expedited hearing insofar as may be 
practicable.
    (g) Order of proceeding and burden of proof. At the hearing, the 
proponent of suspension shall have the burden of going forward to 
present an affirmative case for the suspension. However, the ultimate 
burden of persuasion shall rest with the proponent of the registration.
    (h) Evidence. The provisions of Sec. 164.81, where applicable, 
apply to an expedited hearing.
    (i) Transcripts. The presiding officer shall make provision for 
daily transcripts and otherwise comply with the provisions of Sec.

Subpart D_Rules of Practice for Applications Under Sections 3 and 18 To 
            Modify Previous Cancellation or Suspension Orders

    Authority: Sec. 25(a) and 6 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, 
and Rodenticide Act, as amended by the Federal Environmental Pesticide 
Control Act of 1972 (86 Stat. 997).

    Source: 40 FR 12265, Mar. 18, 1975, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 164.130  General.

    EPA has determined that any application under section 3 or section 
18 of the Act to allow use of a pesticide at a site and on a pest for 
which registration has been finally cancelled or suspended by the 
Administrator constitutes a petition for reconsideration of such order. 
Because of the extensive notice and hearing opportunities mandated by 
FIFRA and the Administrative Procedures Act before a final cancellation 
or suspension order may be issued, EPA has determined that such orders 
may not be reversed or modified without affording interested parties--
who may in fact have participated in lengthy cancellation proceedings--
similar notice and hearing opportunities. The procedures set forth in 
this subpart D shall govern all such applications.


<R05>
Sec. 164.131  Review by Administrator.

    (a) The Administrator will review applications subject to this 
subpart D and supporting data submitted by the applicant to determine 
whether reconsideration of the Administrator's prior cancellation or 
suspension order is warranted. The Administrator shall determine that 
such reconsideration is warranted when he finds that: (1) The applicant 
has presented substantial new evidence which may materially affect the 
prior cancellation or suspension order and which was not available to 
the Administrator at the time he made his final cancellation or 
suspension determination and (2) such evidence could not, through the 
exercise of due diligence, have been discovered by the parties to the 
cancellation or suspension proceeding prior to the issuance of the final 
order.

[[Page 258]]

    (b) If after review of the application and other supporting data 
submitted by the applicant, the Administrator determines, in accordance 
with paragraph (a) of this section, that reconsideration of his prior 
order is not warranted, then the application will be denied without 
requirement for an administrative hearing. The Administrator shall 
publish notice in the Federal Register of the denial briefly describing 
the basis for his determination as soon as practicable. Such denial 
shall constitute final agency action.
    (c) If after review of the application and other supporting data 
submitted by the applicant, the Administrator determines, in accordance 
with paragraph (a) of this section, that reconsideration of his prior 
order is warranted, he will then publish notice in the Federal Register 
setting forth his determination and briefly describing the basis for the 
determination. Such notice shall announce that a formal public hearing 
will be held in accordance with 5 U.S.C. section 554. The notice shall 
specify: (1) The date on which the hearing will begin and end, (2) the 
issues of fact and law to be adjudicated at the hearing, (3) the date on 
which the presiding officer shall submit his recommendations, including 
findings of fact and conclusions, to the Administrator, and (4) the date 
on which a decision by the Administrator is anticipated.


<R05>
Sec. 164.132  Procedures governing hearing.

    (a) The burden of proof in the hearing convened pursuant to Sec. 
164.131 shall be on the applicant and he shall proceed first. The issues 
in the hearing shall be whether: (1) Substantial new evidence exists and 
(2) such substantial new evidence requires reversal or modification of 
the existing cancellation or suspension order. The determination of 
these issues shall be made taking into account the human and 
environmental risks found by the Administrator in his cancellation or 
suspension determination and the cumulative effect of all past and 
present uses, including the requested use, and uses which may reasonably 
be anticipated to occur in the future as a result of granting the 
requested reversal or modification. The granting of a particular 
petition for use may not in itself pose a significant risk to man or the 
environment, but the cumulative impact of each additional use of the 
cancelled or suspended pesticide may re-establish, or serve to maintain, 
the significant risks previously found by the Administrator.
    (b) The presiding officer shall make recommendations, including 
findings of fact and conclusions and to the extent feasible, as 
determined by the presiding officer, the procedures at the hearing shall 
follow the Rules of Practice, set forth in subparts A and B of this part 
164.


<R05>
Sec. 164.133  Emergency waiver of hearing.

    (a) In the case of an application subject to this subpart D which is 
filed under section 18 of FIFRA, and regulations thereunder, and for 
which a hearing is required pursuant to Sec. 164.131, the Administrator 
may dispense with the requirement of convening such a hearing in any 
case in which he determines:
    (1) That the application presents a situation involving need to use 
the pesticide to prevent an unacceptable risk: (i) To human health, or 
(ii) to fish or wildlife populations when such use would not pose a 
human health hazard; and
    (2) That there is no other feasible solution to such risk; and
    (3) That the time available to avert the risk to human health or 
fish and wildlife is insufficient to permit convening a hearing as 
required by Sec. 164.131; and
    (4) That the public interest requires the granting of the requested 
use as soon as possible.
    (b) Notice of any determination made by the Administrator pursuant 
to paragraph (a) of this section shall be published in the Federal 
Register as soon as practicable after granting the requested use and 
shall set forth the basis for the Administrator's determination.

    Terms used in this part have the same meaning as in the Act and part 
152 of this chapter. In addition, as used in this part, the following 
terms shall have the meanings set forth below.
    Act means the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.
    Agricultural pesticide means any pesticide product labeled for use 
in or on a farm, forest, nursery, or greenhouse.
    Appurtenance means any equipment or device which is used for the 
purpose of transferring a pesticide from a stationary pesticide 
container or to any refillable container, including but not limited to, 
hoses, fittings, plumbing, valves, gauges, pumps and metering devices.
    Capacity means, as applied to containers, the rated capacity of the 
container.
    Container means any package, can, bottle, bag, barrel, drum, tank, 
or other containing-device (excluding any application tanks) used to 
enclose a pesticide. Containers that are used to sell or distribute a 
pesticide product and that also function in applying the product (such 
as spray bottles, aerosol cans and containers that become part of a 
direct injection system) are considered to be containers for the 
purposes of this part.
    Containment pad means any structure that is designed and constructed 
to intercept and contain pesticides, rinsates, and equipment wash water 
at a pesticide dispensing area.
    Containment structure means either a secondary containment unit or a 
containment pad.

[[Page 260]]

    Custom blending means the service of mixing pesticides to a 
customer's specifications, usually a pesticide(s)-fertilizer(s), 
pesticide-pesticide, or a pesticide-animal feed mixture, when:
    (1) The blend is prepared to the order of the customer and is not 
held in inventory by the blender;
    (2) The blend is to be used on the customer's property (including 
leased or rented property);
    (3) The pesticide(s) used in the blend bears end-use labeling 
directions which do not prohibit use of the product in such a blend;
    (4) The blend is prepared from registered pesticides; and
    (5) The blend is delivered to the end-user along with a copy of the 
end-use labeling of each pesticide used in the blend and a statement 
specifying the composition of the mixture.
    Dilutable means that the pesticide product's labeling allows or 
requires the pesticide product to be mixed with a liquid diluent prior 
to application or use.
    Dry pesticide means any pesticide that is in solid form and that has 
not been combined with liquids; this includes formulations such as 
dusts, wettable powders, dry flowables, water-soluble powders, granules, 
and dry baits.
    Establishment means any site where a pesticidal product, active 
ingredient, or device is produced, regardless of whether such site is 
independently owned or operated, and regardless of whether such site is 
domestic and producing a pesticidal product for export only, or whether 
the site is foreign and producing any pesticidal product for import into 
the United States.
    Facility means all buildings, equipment, structures, and other 
stationary items which are located on a single site or on contiguous or 
adjacent sites and which are owned or operated by the same person (or by

    Nonrefillable container means a container that is not a refillable 
container and that is designed and constructed for one-time use and is 
not intended to be filled again with a pesticide for sale or 
distribution. Reconditioned containers are considered to be 
nonrefillable containers.
    One-way valve means a valve that is designed and constructed to 
allow virtually unrestricted flow in one direction and no flow in the 
opposite direction, thus allowing the withdrawal of material from, but 
not the introduction of material into, a container.
    Operator means any person in control of, or having responsibility 
for, the daily operation of a facility at which a containment structure 
is located.
    Owner means any person who owns a facility at which a containment 
structure is required.
    Pesticide compatible as applied to containers means that the 
container construction materials will not chemically react with the 
formulation. A container is not compatible with the formulation if, for 
example, the formulation:
    (1) Is corrosive to the container;
    (2) Causes softening, premature aging, or embrittlement of the 
container;
    (3) Otherwise causes the container to weaken or to create the risk 
of discharge;
    (4) Reacts in a significant chemical, electrolytic, or galvanic 
manner with the container, or
    (5) Interacts in a way, such as the active ingredient permeating the 
container wall, that would cause the formulation to differ from its 
composition as described in the statement required in connection with 
its registration under FIFRA section 3.
    Pesticide compatible as applied to containment means that the 
containment construction materials are able to withstand anticipated 
exposure to stored or transferred substances without losing the 
capability to provide the required containment of the same or other 
substances within the containment area.
    Pesticide dispensing area means an area in which pesticide is 
transferred out of or into a container.
    Portable pesticide container means a refillable container that is 
not a stationary pesticide container.
    Produce means to manufacture, prepare, propagate, compound, or 
process any pesticide, including any pesticide produced pursuant to 
section 5 of the

[[Page 261]]

Act, and any active ingredient or device, or to package, repackage, 
label, relabel, or otherwise change the container of any pesticide or 
device.
    Producer means any person, as defined by the Act, who produces any 
pesticide, active ingredient, or device (including packaging, 
repackaging, labeling and relabeling).
    Refillable container means a container that is intended to be filled 
with pesticide more than once for sale or distribution.
    Refiller means a person who engages in the activity of repackaging 
pesticide product into refillable containers. This could include a 
registrant or a person operating under contract to a registrant.
    Refilling establishment means an establishment where the activity of 
repackaging pesticide product into refillable containers occurs.
    Repackage means, for the purposes of this part, to transfer a 
pesticide formulation from one container to another without a change in 
the composition of the formulation, the labeling content, or the 
product's EPA registration number, for sale or distribution.
    Rinsate means the liquid resulting from the rinsing of the interior 
of any equipment or container that has come in direct contact with any 
pesticide.
    Runoff means surface water leaving the target site.
    Secondary containment unit means any structure, including rigid 
diking, that is designed and constructed to intercept and contain 
pesticide spills and leaks and to prevent runoff and leaching from 
stationary pesticide containers.
    Stationary pesticide container means a refillable container that is 
fixed at a single facility or establishment or, if not fixed, remains at 
the facility or establishment for at least 30 consecutive days, and that 
holds pesticide during the entire time.
    Suspension concentrate means a stable suspension of solid 
particulate active ingredients in a liquid intended for dilution with 
water before use.
    Tamper-evident device means a device which can be visually inspected 
to determine if a container has been opened.
    Transport vehicle means a cargo-carrying vehicle such as an 
automobile, van, tractor, truck, semitrailer, tank car or rail car used 
for the transportation of cargo by any mode.
    Washwater means the liquid resulting from the rinsing of the 
exterior of any equipment or containers that have or may have come in 
direct contact with any pesticide or system maintenance compound, such 
as oil or antifreeze.

otherwise exempted by paragraph (c) of this section must be subject to 
the nonrefillable container regulations in this subpart to prevent an 
unreasonable adverse effect on the environment, EPA may require, by 
rule, that the product be distributed or sold in nonrefillable 
containers that comply with all or some of the requirements in this 
subpart. Alternatively, EPA may notify the applicant or registrant of 
its intent to make such a determination. After allowing the applicant or 
registrant a reasonable amount of time to reply, EPA may require, by 
notification and as a condition of registration, that the product be 
distributed or sold in nonrefillable containers that comply with all or 
some of the requirements in this subpart. For the purpose of the 
previous sentence, 60 days would be a reasonable amount of time to 
reply, although EPA may, in its discretion, provide more time. EPA may 
deny registration or initiate cancellation proceedings if the registrant 
fails to comply with the nonrefillable container regulations within the 
time frames established by EPA in the rule or in its notification.
    (e) What other pesticide products are subject to the regulations in 
this subpart? (1) Except for manufacturing use products, plant-
incorporated protectants,

[[Page 263]]

and antimicrobial products that are exempt under paragraph (c) of this 
section, all of the regulations in this subpart apply to a pesticide 
product if it satisfies at least one of the following criteria:
    (i) The pesticide product meets the criteria of Toxicity Category I 
as set out in Sec. 156.62 of this chapter.
    (ii) The pesticide product meets the criteria of Toxicity Category 
II as set out in Sec. 156.62 of this chapter.
    (iii) The pesticide product is classified for restricted use as set 
out in Sec. Sec. 152.160 - 152.175 of this chapter.
    (2) Except for manufacturing use products, plant-incorporated 
protectants, antimicrobial products that are exempt under (c) of this 
section, and other pesticide products that are regulated under paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section, a pesticide product must be packaged in 
compliance with 49 CFR 173.24. If the pesticide product meets the 
definition of a hazardous material in 49 CFR 171.8, the Department of 
Transportation requires it to be packaged according to 49 CFR parts 171-
180.
    (f) What does ``pesticide product'' or ``pesticide'' mean in the 
rest of this subpart? In Sec. Sec. 165.25 through 165.27, the term 
``pesticide product'' or ``pesticide'' refers only to a pesticide 
product or a pesticide that is subject to the regulations in this 
subpart as described in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.

Sec. 165.25  Nonrefillable container standards.

    (a) What Department of Transportation (DOT) standards do my 
nonrefillable containers have to meet under this part if my pesticide 
product is not a DOT hazardous material? A pesticide product that does 
not meet the definition of a hazardous material in 49 CFR 171.8 must be 
packaged in a nonrefillable container that, if portable, is designed, 
constructed, and marked to comply with the requirements of 49 CFR 173.4, 
173.5, 173.6, 173.24, 173.24a, 173.24b, 173.28, 173.155, 173.203, 
173.213, 173.240(c), 173.240(d), 173.241(c), 173.241(d), part 178, and 
part 180 that are applicable to a Packing Group III material, or, if 
subject to a special permit, according to the applicable requirements of 
49 CFR part 107 subpart B. The requirements in this paragraph apply to 
the pesticide product as it is packaged for transportation in commerce.
    (b) What DOT standards do my nonrefillable containers have to meet 
under this part if my pesticide product is a DOT hazardous material? (1) 
If your pesticide product meets the definition of a hazardous material 
in 49 CFR 171.8, the DOT requires your pesticide product to be packaged 
according to 49 CFR parts 171-180 or, if subject to a special permit, 
according to the applicable requirements of 49 CFR part 107 subpart B.
    (2) For the purposes of these regulations, a pesticide product that 
meets the definition of a hazardous material in 49 CFR 171.8 must be 
packaged in a nonrefillable container that, if portable, is designed, 
constructed, and marked to comply with the requirements of 49 CFR parts 
171-180 or, if subject to a special permit, according to the applicable 
requirements of 49 CFR part 107 subpart B. The requirements in this 
paragraph apply to the pesticide product as it is packaged for 
transportation in commerce.
    (c) What will EPA do if DOT proposes to change any of the cross-
referenced regulations? If the DOT proposes to change any of the 
regulations that are incorporated in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section, EPA will provide notice of the proposed changes and an 
opportunity to comment in the Federal Register. Following notice and 
comment, EPA will take final action regarding whether or not to revise 
its rules, and the extent to which any such revision will correspond 
with revised DOT regulations.
    (d) What standards for closures do my nonrefillable containers have 
to meet? If your nonrefillable container is a rigid container with a 
capacity equal to or greater than 3.0 liters (0.79 gallons), if the 
container is not an aerosol container or a pressurized container, and if 
the container is used to distribute or sell a liquid agricultural 
pesticide, each nonrefillable container must have at least one of the 
following standard closures:
    (1) Bung, 2 inch pipe size (2.375 inches in diameter), external 
threading, 11.5

[[Page 264]]

threads per inch, National Pipe Straight (NPS) standard.
    (2) Bung, 2 inch pipe size (2.375 inches in diameter), external 
threading, 5 threads per inch, buttress threads.
    (3) Screw cap, 63 millimeters, at least one thread revolution at 6 
threads per inch.
    (4) Screw cap, 38 millimeters, at least one thread revolution at 6 
threads per inch. The cap may fit on a separate rigid spout or on a 
flexible pull-out plastic spout.
    (e) What standards for dispensing do my nonrefillable containers 
have to meet? If your nonrefillable container has a capacity of 5 
gallons (18.9 liters) or less, if the container is not an aerosol 
container, a pressurized container, or a spray bottle, and if the 
container holds a liquid pesticide, your nonrefillable container must do 
both of the following:
    (1) Allow the contents of the nonrefillable container to pour in a 
continuous, coherent stream.
    (2) Allow the contents of the nonrefillable container to be poured 
with a minimum amount of dripping down the outside of the container.
    (f) What standards for residue removal do my nonrefillable 
containers have to meet? Each nonrefillable container and pesticide 
formulation combination must meet the applicable residue removal 
standard of this section.
    (1) If the nonrefillable container is rigid and has a capacity less 
than or equal to 5 gallons (18.9 liters) for liquid formulations or 50 
pounds (22.7 kilograms) for solid formulations and if the pesticide 
product's labeling allows or requires the pesticide product to be mixed 
with a liquid diluent prior to application (that is, if the pesticide is 
dilutable), each container/formulation combination must be capable of 
attaining at least 99.99 percent removal of each active ingredient when 
tested using the EPA test procedure ``Rinsing Procedures for Dilutable 
Pesticide Products in Rigid Containers.''
    (2) The test must be conducted only if the pesticide product is a 
suspension concentrate or if EPA specifically requests the records on a 
case by case basis.
    (3) For the rigid container/dilutable product standard in paragraph 
(f)(1) of this section, percent removal represents the percent of the 
original concentration of the active ingredient in the pesticide product 
when compared to the concentration of that active ingredient in the 
fourth rinse. Percent removal is calculated by the formula:

percent removal = [1.0 - RR] x 100.0, where

    RR = rinsate ratio = Active ingredient concentration in fourth 
rinsate/Original concentration of active ingredient in the product

    (g) Can I obtain a waiver from or a modification to any of the 
nonrefillable container standards? Yes, it is possible for you to obtain 
a waiver from or a modification to the nonrefillable container 
standards, as follows:
    (1) EPA may waive or modify the requirements of paragraph (a) of 
this section regarding the DOT standards for pesticide products that are 
not DOT hazardous materials if EPA determines that an alternative 
(partial or modified) set of standards or pre-existing requirements 
achieves a level of safety that is at least equal to that specified in 
the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) EPA may waive or modify the requirements of paragraph (b) of 
this section regarding the DOT standards for pesticide products that are 
DOT hazardous materials if EPA determines that an alternative (partial 
or modified) set of standards or pre-existing requirements achieves a 
level of safety that is at least equal to that specified in the 
requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. EPA will modify or waive 
the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section only after consulting 
with DOT to ensure consistency with DOT regulations and exemptions.
    (3) EPA may approve a non-standard closure (that is, a closure not 
listed in paragraph (d) of this section) if EPA determines that both of 
the following conditions are satisfied:
    (i) The non-standard closure is necessary for the proper mixing, 
loading, or application of the pesticide product.
    (ii) The non-standard closure offers exposure protection to handlers 
during mixing and loading that is the same or greater than that provided 
by the standard closures.

[[Page 265]]

    (4) EPA may waive or modify the container dispensing capability 
standards in paragraph (e) of this section if EPA determines that at 
least one of the following conditions is satisfied:
    (i) The product is typically removed from the container by a method 
other than pouring.
    (ii) Compliance with the container dispensing capability standards 
would increase exposure to the pesticide container handler.
    (5) EPA may waive or modify the requirements of paragraph (f) of 
this section regarding the residue removal standard if EPA determines 
that both of the following conditions are satisfied:
    (i) The residue remaining in the container would not cause an 
unreasonable adverse effect on the environment; and
    (ii) The product offers significant benefits and cannot be 
economically reformulated or repackaged.
    (h) How do I obtain a waiver from or a modification to any of the 
nonrefillable container standards? To obtain a waiver from or a 
modification to any of the nonrefillable container standards, you must

Sec. 165.45  Refillable container standards.

    (a) What Department of Transportation (DOT) standards do my 
refillable containers have to meet under this part if my pesticide 
product is not a DOT hazardous material? (1) A pesticide product that 
does not meet the definition of a hazardous material in 49 CFR 171.8 
must be packaged in a refillable container that, if portable, is 
designed, constructed, and marked to comply with the requirements of 49 
CFR 173.4, 173.5, 173.6, 173.24, 173.24a, 173.24b, 173.28, 173.155, 
173.203, 173.213, 173.240(c), 173.240(d), 173.241(c), 173.241(d), part 
178, and part 180 that are applicable to a Packing Group III material, 
or, if subject to a special permit, according to the applicable 
requirements of 49 CFR part 107 subpart B. The requirements in this 
paragraph apply to the pesticide product as it is packaged for 
transportation in commerce.
    (2) A refiller is not required to comply with 49 CFR 173.28(b)(2) 
for pesticide products that are not DOT hazardous materials if the 
refillable container to be reused complies with the refillable container 
regulations in this subpart and the refilling is done in compliance with 
the repackaging regulations in subpart D of this part.
    (b) What DOT standards do my refillable containers have to meet 
under this part if my pesticide product is a DOT hazardous material? (1) 
If your pesticide product meets the definition of a hazardous material 
in 49 CFR 171.8, the DOT requires your pesticide product to be packaged 
according to 49 CFR parts 171-180 or, if subject to a special permit, 
according to the applicable requirements of 49 CFR part 107 subpart B.
    (2) For the purposes of these regulations, a pesticide product that 
meets the definition of a hazardous material in 49 CFR 171.8 must be 
packaged in a refillable container that, if portable, is designed, 
constructed, and marked to comply with the requirements of 49 CFR parts 
171-180 or, if subject to a special permit, according to the applicable

[[Page 269]]

requirements of 49 CFR part 107 subpart B. The requirements in this 
paragraph apply to the pesticide product as it is packaged for 
transportation in commerce.
    (c) What will EPA do if DOT proposes to change any of the cross-
referenced regulations? If the DOT proposes to change any of the 
regulations that are incorporated in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section, EPA will provide notice of the proposed changes and an 
opportunity to comment in the Federal Register. Following notice and 
comment, EPA will take final action regarding whether or not to revise 
its rules, and the extent to which any such revision will correspond 
with revised DOT regulations.
    (d) What standards for marking do my refillable containers have to 
meet? Each refillable container must be marked in a durable and clearly 
visible manner with a serial number or other identifying code that will 
distinguish the individual container from all other containers. Durable 
marking includes, but is not limited to, etching, embossing, ink 
jetting, stamping, heat stamping, mechanically attaching a plate, 
molding, and marking with durable ink. The serial number or other 
identifying code must be located on the outside part of the container 
except on a closure. Placement on the label or labeling is not 
sufficient unless the label is an integral, permanent part of or 
permanently stamped on the container.
    (e) What standards for openings do my refillable containers have to 
meet? If your refillable container is a portable pesticide container 
that is designed to hold liquid pesticide formulations and is not a 
cylinder that complies with the DOT Hazardous Materials Regulations in 
49 CFR parts 171-180, each opening of the container other than a vent 
must have a one-way valve, a tamper-evident device or both. A one-way 
valve may be located in a device or system separate from the container 
if the device or system is the only reasonably foreseeable way to 
withdraw pesticide from the container. A vent must be designed to 
minimize the amount of material that could be introduced into the 
container through it.
    (f) What standards do my stationary pesticide containers have to 
meet? If a stationary pesticide container designed to hold undivided 
quantities of pesticides equal to or greater than 500 gallons (1,890 
liters) of liquid pesticide or equal to or greater than 4,000 pounds 
(1,818 kilograms) of dry pesticide is located at the refilling 
establishment of a refiller operating under written contract to you, the 
stationary pesticide container must meet the following standards:
    (1) Except during a civil emergency or any unanticipated grave 
natural disaster or other natural phenomenon of an exceptional, 
inevitable and irresistible character, the effects of which could not 
have been prevented or avoided by the exercise of due care or foresight, 
each stationary pesticide container (for liquid and dry pesticides) and 
its appurtenances must meet both of the following standards:
    (i) Each stationary pesticide container and its appurtenances must 
be resistant to extreme changes in temperature and constructed of 
materials that are adequately thick to not fail and that are resistant 
to corrosion, puncture, or cracking.
    (ii) Each stationary pesticide container must be capable of 
withstanding all operating stresses, taking into account static heat, 
pressure buildup from pumps and compressors, and any other foreseeable 
mechanical stresses to which the container may be subjected in the 
course of operations.
    (2) Each stationary container of liquid pesticides must meet all of 
the following standards:
    (i) Each stationary container of liquid pesticides must be equipped 
with a vent or other device designed to relieve excess pressure, prevent 
losses by evaporation, and exclude precipitation.
    (ii) External sight gauges, which are pesticide-containing hoses or 
tubes that run vertically along the exterior of the container from the 
top to the bottom, are prohibited on stationary containers of liquid 
pesticides.
    (iii) Each connection on a stationary container of liquid pesticides 
that is below the normal liquid level must be equipped with a shutoff 
valve which is capable of being locked closed. A shutoff valve must be 
located within a secondary containment unit if one is required by 
subpart E of this part.

    (2) For the purposes of this subpart, an antimicrobial swimming pool 
product is a pesticide product that satisfies both of the following 
conditions:
    (i) The pesticide product is intended to: disinfect, sanitize, 
reduce or mitigate growth or development of microbiological organisms; 
or protect inanimate objects, industrial processes or systems, surfaces, 
water, or other chemical substances from contamination, fouling, or 
deterioration caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, algae, or 
slime.
    (ii) The labeling of the pesticide product includes directions for 
use on only a site or sites in the antimicrobial product use category of 
swimming pools.
    (e) How will EPA determine if an antimicrobial pesticide product 
otherwise exempted must be subject to the regulations in this subpart to 
prevent an unreasonable adverse effect on the environment? (1) EPA may 
determine that an antimicrobial pesticide product otherwise exempted by 
paragraph (c) of this section must be subject to the repackaging 
regulations in this subpart to prevent an unreasonable adverse effect on 
the environment if all of the following conditions exist:
    (i) EPA obtains information, data or other evidence of a problem 
with the containers of a certain pesticide product or related group of 
products.
    (ii) The information, data or other evidence is reliable and 
factual.
    (iii) The problem causes or could reasonably be expected to cause an 
unreasonable adverse effect on the environment.
    (iv) Complying with the container regulations could reasonably be 
expected to eliminate the problem.
    (2) If EPA determines that an antimicrobial pesticide product 
otherwise exempted by paragraph (c) of this section must be subject to 
the repackaging regulations in this subpart to prevent an unreasonable 
adverse effect on the environment, EPA may require, by rule, that the 
product be repackaged in compliance with all or some of the requirements 
in this subpart. Alternatively, EPA may notify the applicant or 
registrant of its intent to make such a determination. After allowing 
the applicant or registrant a reasonable amount of time to reply, EPA 
may require, by notification and as a condition of registration, that 
the product be repackaged in compliance with all or some of the 
requirements in this subpart. For the purpose of the previous sentence, 
60 days would be a reasonable amount of time to reply, although EPA may, 
in its discretion, provide more time. EPA may deny registration or 
initiate cancellation proceedings if the registrant fails to comply with 
the repackaging regulations within the time frames established by EPA in 
the rule or in its notification.
    (f) What other pesticide products are subject to the regulations in 
this subpart? The regulations in this subpart apply to all pesticide 
products other than manufacturing use products, plant-incorporated 
protectants, and antimicrobial products that are exempt paragraph (c) of 
this section. Antimicrobial products covered under paragraph (d) of this 
section are subject to the regulations indicated in that section.
    (g) What does ``pesticide product'' or ``pesticide'' mean in the 
rest of this subpart? In Sec. Sec. 165.63(h) through 165.70, the term 
``pesticide product'' or ``pesticide'' refers only to a pesticide 
product or a pesticide that is subject to the regulations in this 
subpart as described in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section.
    (h) Are there any other exceptions? (1) The regulations in this 
subpart do not apply to transport vehicles that contain pesticide in 
pesticide-holding tanks that are an integral part of the transport 
vehicle and that are the primary containment for the pesticide.
    (2) Custom blending is not subject to the regulations in this 
subpart.
    (3) The regulations in this subpart do not apply to containers that 
hold pesticides that are gaseous at atmospheric temperature and 
pressure.

<R05>
Sec. 165.65  Registrants who distribute or sell pesticide products in refillable containers.

    (a) Must I comply with the standards in this section? You must 
comply with the standards in this section if you are a

[[Page 273]]

registrant who distributes or sells pesticide products in refillable 
containers. This means that you conduct all of the repackaging for a 
pesticide product and that you do not distribute or sell the pesticide 
product to a refiller that is not part of your company for repackaging 
into refillable containers. If you are a registrant that repackages a 
product directly into refillable containers for sale or distribution and 
you also sell or distribute other quantities of that product to an 
independent refiller for repackaging, then you must meet the 
requirements in this section for those quantities you distribute or sell 
directly and the requirements in Sec. 165.67 for those quantities that 
you distribute or sell to an independent refiller.
    (b) Am I responsible for product integrity? Yes, you are responsible 
for the pesticide product that you distribute or sell in refillable 
containers not being adulterated or different from the composition 
described in its confidential statement of formula that is required 
under FIFRA section 3.
    (c) What information must I develop? For each pesticide product 
distributed or sold in refillable containers, you must develop both of 
the following documents in writing.
    (1) You must develop a refilling residue removal procedure that 
describes how to remove pesticide residue from a refillable container 
(portable or stationary pesticide container) before it is refilled.
    (i) The refilling residue removal procedure must be adequate to 
ensure that the composition of the pesticide product does not differ at 
the time of its distribution or sale from the composition described in 
its confidential statement of formula that is required under FIFRA 
section 3.
    (ii) If the refilling residue removal procedure requires the use of 
a solvent other than the diluent used for applying the pesticide as 
specified on the labeling under ``Directions for Use,'' or if there is 
no diluent used for application, the refilling residue removal procedure 
must describe how to manage any rinsate resulting from the procedure in 
accordance with applicable Federal and State regulations.
    (2) You must develop a description of acceptable refillable 
containers (portable or stationary pesticide containers) that can be 
used for distributing or selling that pesticide product.
    (i) An acceptable container is one that you have determined meets 
the standards in subpart C of this part and is compatible with the 
pesticide formulation intended to be distributed and sold using the 
refillable container.
    (ii) You must identify the containers by specifying the container 
materials of construction that are compatible with the pesticide 
formulation and specifying information necessary to confirm compliance 
with the refillable container requirements in subpart C of this part.
    (d) What requirements must my individual establishments follow 
regarding repackaging a pesticide product into refillable containers? A 
refiller at your individual establishment that repackages a pesticide 
product into refillable containers for distribution or sale must comply 
with all of the following provisions.
    (1) The establishment must be registered with EPA as a producing 
establishment as required by Sec. 167.20 of this chapter.
    (2) The refiller must not change the pesticide formulation unless 
the refiller has a registration for the new formulation.
    (3) The refiller must repackage a pesticide product only into a 
refillable container that is identified on your description of 
acceptable containers for that pesticide product.
    (4) The refiller may repackage any quantity of a pesticide product 
into a refillable container up to the rated capacity of the container. 
In addition, there are no general limits on the size of the refillable 
containers that the refiller can use.
    (5) The refiller must have all of the following items at the 
establishment before repackaging a pesticide product into any refillable 
container for distribution or sale:
    (i) The pesticide product's label and labeling.
    (ii) The written refilling residue removal procedure for the 
pesticide product.

[[Page 274]]

    (iii) The written description of acceptable containers for the 
pesticide product.
    (6) Before repackaging a pesticide product into any refillable 
container for distribution or sale, the refiller must identify the 
pesticide product previously contained in the refillable container to 
determine whether a residue removal procedure must be conducted in 
accordance with paragraph (f) of this section. The refiller may identify 
the previous pesticide product by referring to the label or labeling.
    (7) The refiller must inspect each refillable container according to 
paragraph (e) of this section.
    (8) The refiller must clean each refillable container according to 
paragraph (f) or (g) of this section, if required by either paragraph.
    (9) The refiller must ensure that each refillable container is 
properly labeled according to paragraph (h) of this section.
    (10) The establishment must maintain records in accordance with 
paragraph (i) of this section.
    (11) The establishment must maintain records as required by part 169 
of this chapter.
    (12) The establishment must report as required by part 167 of this 
chapter.
    (e) How must my individual establishments inspect refillable 
containers? Before repackaging a pesticide product into any refillable 
container, a refiller at your establishment must visually inspect the 
exterior and (if possible) the interior of the container and the 
exterior of appurtenances. The purpose of the inspection is to determine 
whether the container meets the necessary criteria with respect to 
continued container integrity, required markings, and openings. If the 
condition in paragraph (e)(1) of this section exists, the container 
fails the inspection and must not be refilled unless the container is 
repaired, reconditioned, or remanufactured in compliance with the 
relevant DOT requirement. If the condition in paragraph (e)(2) or (e)(3) 
of this section exists (or both), the container fails the inspection and 
must not be refilled until the container meets the standards specified 
in subpart C of this part. The conditions are:
    (1) The integrity of the container is compromised in at least one of 
the following ways:
    (i) The container shows signs of rupture or other damage which 
reduces its structural integrity.
    (ii) The container has visible pitting, significant reduction in 
material thickness, metal fatigue, damaged threads or closures, or other 
significant defects.
    (iii) The container has cracks, warpage, corrosion or any other 
damage which might render it unsafe for transportation.
    (iv) There is damage to the fittings, valves, tamper-evident devices 
or other appurtenances that may cause failure of the container.
    (2) The container does not bear the markings required by Sec. 
165.45(a), (b) and (d), or such markings are not legible.
    (3) The container does not have an intact and functioning one-way 
valve or tamper-evident device on each opening other than a vent, if 
required.
    (f) How must my individual establishments clean refillable 
containers? A refiller at your establishment must clean each refillable 
container by conducting the pesticide product's refilling residue 
removal procedure before repackaging the pesticide product into the 
refillable container, unless the conditions in paragraph (f)(1) of this 
section and either paragraph (f)(2) or (f)(3) of this section are 
satisfied:
    (1) If required, each tamper-evident device and one-way valve is 
intact.
    (2) The refillable container is being refilled with the same 
pesticide product.
    (3) Both of the following conditions are satisfied:
    (i) The container previously held a pesticide product with a single 
active ingredient and is being used to repackage a pesticide product 
with the same single active ingredient.
    (ii) There is no change that would cause the composition of the 
product being repackaged to differ from the composition described in its 
confidential statement of formula that is required under FIFRA section 
3. Examples of unallowable changes include the active ingredient 
concentration increasing or decreasing beyond the limits established by 
the confidential

[[Page 275]]

statement of formula or a reaction or interaction between the pesticide 
product being repackaged and the residue remaining in the container.
    (g) How must my individual establishments clean a refillable 
container that has a broken (non-intact) tamper-evident device or one-
way valve? As required in paragraph (f) of this section, a refiller at 
your establishment must clean each refillable container that has a 
tamper-evident device or one-way valve that is not intact by conducting 
the pesticide product's refilling residue removal procedure before 
repackaging the pesticide product into the refillable container. In 
addition, other procedures may be necessary to assure that product 
integrity is maintained in such cases.
    (h) How must my individual establishments label refillable 
containers? Before distributing or selling a pesticide product in a 
refillable container, a refiller at your establishment must ensure that 
the label of the pesticide product is securely attached to the 
refillable container such that the label can reasonably be expected to 
remain affixed during the foreseeable conditions and period of use. The 
label and labeling must comply in all respects with the requirements of 
part 156 of this chapter. In particular, the refiller at your 
establishment must ensure that the net contents statement and EPA 
establishment number appear on the label.
    (i) What recordkeeping must my individual establishments do? Each of 
your individual establishments that repackages a pesticide product into 
refillable containers for distribution or sale must maintain all of the 
records listed in this section in addition to the applicable records 
identified in parts 167 and 169 of this chapter. The establishment must 
furnish these records for inspection and copying upon request by an 
employee of EPA or any entity designated by EPA, such as a State, 
another political subdivision or a Tribe.
    (1) For each pesticide product distributed or sold in refillable 
containers, both of the following records must be maintained for the 
current operating year and for 3 years after that:
    (i) The written refilling residue removal procedure for the 
pesticide product.
    (ii) The written description of acceptable containers for the 
pesticide product.
    (2) Each time a refiller at your establishment repackages a 
pesticide product into a refillable container and distributes or sells 
the product, the following records must be generated and maintained for 
at least 3 years after the date of repackaging:
    (i) The EPA registration number of the pesticide product distributed 
or sold in the refillable container.
    (ii) The date of the repackaging.
    (iii) The serial number or other identifying code of the refillable 
container.

165.45(a), (b) and (d), or such markings are not legible.
    (3) The container does not have an intact and functioning one-way 
valve or tamper-evident device on each opening other than a vent, if 
required.
    (g) How must I clean refillable containers? You must clean each 
refillable container by conducting the pesticide product's refilling 
residue removal procedure before repackaging the pesticide product into 
the refillable container, unless the conditions in paragraph (g)(1) of 
this section and either paragraph (g)(2) or (g)(3) of this section are 
satisfied:
    (1) If required, each tamper-evident device and one-way valve is 
intact.
    (2) The refillable container is being refilled with the same 
pesticide product.
    (3) Both of the following conditions are satisfied.
    (i) The container previously held a pesticide product with a single 
active ingredient and is being used to repackage a pesticide product 
with the same single active ingredient.
    (ii) There is no change that would cause the composition of the 
product being repackaged to differ from the composition described in its 
confidential statement of formula that is required under FIFRA section 
3. Examples of unallowable changes include the active ingredient 
concentration increasing or decreasing beyond the limits established by 
the confidential statement of formula or a reaction or interaction 
between the pesticide product being repackaged and the residue remaining 
in the container.
    (h) How must I clean a refillable container that has a broken (non-
intact) tamper-evident device or one-way valve? As

[[Page 279]]

required in paragraph (g) of this section, you must clean each 
refillable container that has a tamper-evident device or one-way valve 
that is not intact by conducting the pesticide product's refilling 
residue removal procedure before repackaging the pesticide product into 
the refillable container. In addition, other procedures may be necessary 
to assure that product integrity is maintained in such cases.
    (i) How must I label refillable containers? Before distributing or 
selling a pesticide product in a refillable container, you must ensure 
that the label of the pesticide product is securely attached to the 
refillable container such that the label can reasonably be expected to 
remain affixed during the foreseeable conditions and period of use. The 
label and labeling must comply in all respects with the requirements of 
part 156 of this chapter. In particular, you must ensure that the net 
contents statement and EPA establishment number appear on the label.
    (j) What recordkeeping must I do? You must maintain all of the 
records listed in this section in addition to the applicable records 
identified in parts 167 and 169 of this chapter. You must furnish these 
records for inspection and copying upon request by an employee of EPA or 
any entity designated by EPA, such as a State, another political 
subdivision or a Tribe.
    (1) For each pesticide product distributed or sold in refillable 
containers, all of the following records must be maintained for the 
current operating year and for 3 years after that:
    (i) The written contract from the pesticide product's registrant for 
the pesticide product.
    (ii) The written refilling residue removal procedure for the 
pesticide product.
    (iii) The written description of acceptable containers for the 
pesticide product.
    (2) Each time you repackage a pesticide product into a refillable 
container and distribute or sell the product, the following records must 
be generated and maintained for at least 3 years after the date of 
repackaging:
    (i) The EPA registration number of the pesticide product distributed 
or sold in the refillable container.
    (ii) The date of the repackaging.
    (iii) The serial number or other identifying code of the refillable 
container.

structure (including, but not limited to, pesticide residues washed off 
the containment structure by rainfall or cleaning liquids used within 
the structure.)
    (2) Ensure that pesticide spills and leaks on or in any containment 
structure are collected and recovered in a manner that ensures 
protection of human health and the environment (including surface water 
and groundwater) and maximum practicable recovery of the pesticide 
spilled or leaked. Cleanup must occur no later than the end of the day 
on which pesticides have been spilled or leaked except in circumstances 
where a reasonable delay would significantly reduce the likelihood or 
severity of adverse effects to human health or the environment.
    (3) Ensure that all materials resulting from spills and leaks and 
any materials containing pesticide residue are managed according to 
label instructions and applicable Federal, State and local laws and 
regulations.
    (4) Ensure that transfers of pesticides between containers, or 
between containers and transport vehicles are attended at all times.
    (5) Ensure that each lockable valve on a stationary pesticide 
container, if it is required by Sec. 165.45(f), is closed and locked, 
or that the facility is locked, whenever the facility is unattended.

structure. Your inspection must look for visible signs of wetting, 
discoloration, blistering, bulging, corrosion, cracks or other signs of 
damage or leakage.
    (2) Initiate repair to any areas showing visible signs of damage and 
seal any cracks and gaps in the containment structure or appurtenances 
with material compatible with the pesticide being stored or dispensed no 
later than the end of the day on which damage is noticed and complete 
repairs within a time frame that is reasonable, taking into account 
factors such as the weather, and the availability of cleanup materials, 
trained staff, and equipment.
    (3) Not store any additional pesticide on a containment structure if 
the structure fails to meet the requirements of this subpart until 
suitable repairs have been made.

Sec. 165.92  What if I need both a containment pad and a secondary containment unit?

    You may combine containment pads and secondary containment units as 
an integrated system provided the requirements set out in this subpart 
for containment pads and secondary containment units in Sec. Sec. 
165.85(a) and (b), 165.87(a) and (b) and Sec. 165.90, and as 
applicable, Sec. Sec. 165.85(c)-(f) and 165.87(c)-(f) are satisfied 
separately.


<R05>
Sec. 165.95  What recordkeeping do I have to do as a facility owner or operator?

    As a facility owner or operator subject to the requirements of this 
subpart, you must maintain the following records, and you must furnish 
these records for inspection and copying upon request by an employee of 
EPA or any entity designated by EPA, such as a State, another political 
subdivision or a Tribe:
    (a) Records of inspection and maintenance for each containment 
structure and for each stationary pesticide container and its 
appurtenances must be kept for 3 years and must include the following 
information:
    (1) Name of the person conducting the inspection or maintenance;
    (2) Date the inspection or maintenance was conducted;

[[Page 285]]

    (3) Conditions noted;
    (4) Specific maintenance performed.
    (b) Records for any non-stationary pesticide container designed to 
hold undivided quantities of agricultural pesticides equal to or greater 
than 500 gallons (1,890 liters) of liquid pesticide or equal to or 
greater than 4,000 pounds (1,818 kilograms) of dry pesticide that holds 
pesticide but is not protected by a secondary containment unit meeting 
these regulations must be kept for 3 years. Records on these non-
stationary pesticide containers must include the time period that the 
container remains at the same location.
    (c) Records of the construction date of the containment structure 
must be kept for as long as the pesticide containment structure is in 
use, and for 3 years afterwards.


<R05>
Sec. 165.97  States with existing containment programs.

    (a) What options are available to States that already have 
containment regulations? States that have promulgated containment 
regulations effective prior to August 16, 2006, and which also have 
primary enforcement responsibility and/or certification programs, have 
the option of continuing to implement their own programs in lieu of 
these Federal regulations.
    (b) How may a State request authority to continue implementing its 
State containment regulations? A State with pesticide containment 
regulations may request the authority to continue implementing State 
containment regulations by August 16, 2007 in the following manner:
    (1) The State must submit a letter and any supporting documentation 
to EPA. Supporting documentation must demonstrate that the State's 
program is providing environmental protection equivalent to or more 
protective than that expected to be provided by the Federal regulations 
in this subpart.
    (2) The State must identify any significant changes to State 
regulations which would be necessary in order to provide environmental 
protection equivalent to the EPA regulations, and develop an estimated 
timetable to effect these changes. The letter must be signed by the 
designated State Lead Agency.
    (c) How will EPA notify the State if its request is granted? EPA's 
Office of Pesticide Programs will review the State's correspondence and 
determine whether the State program is adequate to provide environmental 
protection equivalent to or more protective than these Federal 
regulations for new and existing containment structures. EPA's Office of 
Pesticide Programs will inform the State of its determination through a 
letter authorizing or declining to authorize the State to continue 
implementing its containment regulations and will detail any reasons for 
declining authorization.
    (d) How must a State inform EPA of revisions to its containment 
regulations? Any state that has received authorization to continue 
implementing its state containment regulations must inform EPA by letter 
signed by the designated State Lead Agency within 6 months of any 
revision to the State's containment regulations. EPA will inform the 
state by letter if it determines that the State's containment 
regulations are no longer adequate based on the revisions. The State's 
containment regulations will remain in effect, unless and until EPA 
sends the state a letter making this determination.

                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 166.1  Purpose and organization.

    (a) Purpose and scope. Section 18 of the Act authorizes the 
Administrator to exempt State and Federal agencies from any provision of 
the Act, if he determines that emergency conditions exist which require 
an exemption. The regulations in this part establish procedures whereby 
the Administrator may exempt a Federal or State agency from the 
provisions of the Act which regulate the manner in which a pesticide is 
made available for use or is used.
    (b) Organization. (1) The provisions in subpart A of this part 
describe the four types of emergency exemptions authorized by the Agency 
and define terms used in this part.
    (2) Subpart B of this part establishes procedures and criteria for 
specific, quarantine, and public health exemptions.
    (3) Subpart C of this part establishes procedures and criteria for 
crisis exemptions.


<R05>
Sec. 166.2  Types of exemptions.

    There are four types of emergency exemptions which may be 
authorized: specific, quarantine, public health, and crisis exemptions.
    (a) Specific exemption. A specific exemption may be authorized in an 
emergency condition to avert:
    (1) A significant economic loss; or
    (2) A significant risk to:
    (i) Endangered species,
    (ii) Threatened species,
    (iii) Beneficial organisms, or
    (iv) The environment.
    (b) Quarantine exemption. A quarantine exemption may be authorized 
in an emergency condition to control the introduction or spread of any 
pest that is an invasive species, or is otherwise new to or not 
theretofore known to be widely prevalent or distributed within and 
throughout the United States and its territories.
    (c) Public health exemption. A public health exemption may be 
authorized in an emergency condition to control a pest that will cause a 
significant risk to human health.
    (d) Crisis exemption. A crisis exemption may be utilized in an 
emergency condition when the time from discovery of the emergency to the 
time when the pesticide use is needed is insufficient to allow for the 
authorization of a specific, quarantine, or public health exemption.

    (3) The situation:
    (i) Involves the introduction or dissemination of an invasive 
species or a pesticide new to or not theretofore known to be widely 
prevalent or distributed within or throughout the United States and its 
territories; or
    (ii) Will present significant risks to human health; or
    (iii) Will present significant risks to threatened or endangered 
species, beneficial organisms, or the environment; or
    (iv) Will cause significant economic loss due to:
    (A) An outbreak or an expected outbreak of a pest; or
    (B) A change in plant growth or development caused by unusual 
environmental conditions where such change can be rectified by the use 
of a pesticide(s).
    First food use means the use of a pesticide on a food or in a manner 
which otherwise would be expected to result in residues in a food, if no 
tolerance or exemption from the requirements of a tolerance for residues

provide economic incentive for registration by the crop protection 
industry.
    New chemical means an active ingredient not contained in any 
currently registered pesticide.
    Significant economic loss means that, compared to the situation 
without the pest emergency and despite the best efforts of the affected 
persons, the emergency conditions at the specific use site identified in 
the application are reasonably expected to cause losses meeting any of 
the following criteria:
    (1) For pest activity that primarily affects the current crop or 
other output, one or more of the following:
    (i) Yield loss greater than or equal to 20%.
    (ii) Economic loss, including revenue losses and cost increases, 
greater than or equal to 20% of gross revenues.
    (iii) Economic loss, including revenue losses and cost increases 
greater than or equal to 50% of net revenues.
    (2) For any pest activity where EPA determines that the criteria in 
paragraph (1) of this definition would not adequately describe the

Sec. 166.7  User notification; advertising.

    (a) A State or Federal agency that obtains an exemption may notify 
eligible users of the availability of the exempted pesticide(s) through 
user groups, retail dealers, and other means. Notification may include 
distributing copies of the section 18 approval letter, labeling, or 
other information to eligible persons.
    (b) As set forth more fully in Sec. 168.22 of this chapter, EPA 
interprets FIFRA sections 12(a)(1) (A) and (B) as making it unlawful for 
any person who distributes, sells, offers for sale, holds for

[[Page 288]]

sale, ships, delivers for shipment, or receives and (having so received) 
delivers or offers to deliver any pesticide, to advertise the pesticide 
for any use authorized by an emergency exemption, except for 
advertisements that are placed in media that address only persons in the 
geographical area to which the exemption applies, state the name and 
address of one or more retail dealers where users may buy the pesticide, 
and contain a prominent notice of the limitations on use under the 
emergency exemption. EPA may withdraw an exemption if the use of the 
pesticide covered by the exemption is advertised unlawfully.

<R05>
Sec. 168.22  Advertising of unregistered pesticides, unregistered uses

of registered pesticides and FIFRA section 24(c) registrations.

    (a) FIFRA sections 12(a)(1) (A) and (B) make it unlawful for any 
person to ``offer for sale'' any pesticide if it is unregistered, or if 
claims made for it as part of its distribution or sale differ 
substantially from any claim made for it as part of the statement 
required in connection with its registration under FIFRA section 3. EPA 
interprets these provisions as extending to advertisements in any 
advertising medium to which pesticide users or the general public have 
access.
    (b) EPA regards it as unlawful for any person who distributes, 
sells, offers for sale, holds for sale, ships, delivers for shipment, or 
receives and (having so received) delivers or offers to deliver any 
pesticide, to place or sponsor advertisements which recommend or suggest 
the purchase or use of:
    (1) Any pesticide for a use authorized under a FIFRA section 5 
experimental use permit (EUP).
    (2) Any pesticide for a use authorized under a FIFRA section 18 
emergency exemption, except for advertisements that:
    (i) Are placed in media which address primarily persons in the 
geographical area to which the exemption applies.
    (ii) State the name and address of one or more retail dealers who 
stock the pesticide.
    (iii) Contain a prominent notice of the limitations on use under the 
section 18 emergency exemption.

[[Page 299]]

    (3) Any pesticide for any use authorized only by a FIFRA section 
24(c) special local need registration, unless the advertisement contains 
a prominent notice of the limitations on use under the section 24(c) 
registrations.
    (4) Any unregistered pesticide for any use unless the advertisement 
is one permitted by paragraph (b) (2) or (3) of this section.
    (5) A registered pesticide product for an unregistered use, unless 
the advertisement is one permitted by paragraph (b) (2) or (3) of this 
section. However, as a matter of policy, the Agency will not regard as 
unlawful the advertisement of uses permitted by FIFRA section 2(ee) 
provided the product is not an antimicrobial pesticide targeted against 
human pathogens (see 51 FR 19174; May 28, 1986).
    (c) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, a ``prominent 
notice of the limitations on use'' is one which sets forth the 
limitations on use in a manner reasonably likely to be understood by 
persons to whom the advertisement is addressed. For printed advertising, 
this criterion will be met by a legend in 6-point or larger type.

Sec. 168.65  Pesticide export label and labeling requirements.

    (a) General. This section describes how EPA interprets and will 
enforce the requirements of FIFRA section 17(a)(1). Every exported 
pesticide, device, and active ingredient used in producing a pesticide 
(see Sec. 152.3 of this chapter for the definition of ``active 
ingredient'' and ``pesticide'') must bear a label or labeling which 
meets the requirements of FIFRA section 17(a)(1). This requirement 
applies to all such pesticides, devices, or active ingredients, 
regardless of whether the export is for commercial or research use. In 
the case of unregistered pesticides, including research substances which 
are being exported for testing, the labeling requirements of this 
section continue to apply independently of whether the exporter must 
submit a purchaser acknowledgement statement under FIFRA section 
17(a)(2) as described at Sec. 168.75 of this chapter. In addition, 
information which will satisfy FIFRA section 2(q)(1)(E), (G), and (H) 
and section 2(q)(2)(A) and (D) must appear in English and in the 
appropriate foreign languages, on the label or labeling as described in 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The required label and labeling 
statements may be met through either immediate container labels, 
accompanying supplemental labeling as described in paragraph (c) of this 
section, or a combination of the two.
    (b) Specific requirements. The labels and labeling of any exported 
pesticides, devices, and active ingredients used in producing pesticides 
must meet the requirements regarding label and labeling content, correct 
representation, and understandability as stated in this paragraph.
    (1) Label contents. The term label means the written, printed, or 
graphic matter on or attached to the immediate container of the 
pesticide, device, or active ingredient used in producing a pesticide. 
In the case that the immediate container is enclosed in an outer 
container or wrapper through which the label cannot be read, the label 
must also be on such outer container or wrapper. Except as provided in 
paragraph (c) of this section, the immediate container of the pesticide, 
device, or active ingredient used in producing a pesticide must bear a 
conspicuous and readable label which includes:
    (i) EPA pesticide producing establishment number. The producing 
establishment registration number must be present but may appear 
anywhere on the label or immediate container in accordance with the 
establishment registration labeling requirements set forth in Sec. 
156.10(f) of this chapter.
    (ii) Warning or caution statements. Warning or caution statements 
must appear on the label and must be adequate for the protection of 
persons handling the pesticide, device, or active ingredients including 
warnings regarding general toxicological hazards

[[Page 300]]

and environmental, physical, or chemical hazards. Warning and caution 
statements must appear in English and in the appropriate foreign 
languages, as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. Where the 
U.S. warning or caution statement, as translated, is obviously 
inappropriate to protect residents of the importing country (for 
example, where a statement calls for a gas mask meeting the 
specifications of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and 
Health), an equivalent caution must be substituted.
    (iii) The statement ``Not Registered for Use in the United States of 
America.'' The labels of all pesticides, devices, and active ingredients 
which are not registered for use in the United States under FIFRA 
section 3 must prominently display the following statement: ``Not 
Registered for Use in the United States of America.'' The statement must 
appear in English and in appropriate foreign languages, as described in 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section. It is permissible to append 
explanatory text which qualifies the statement by pointing out the 
reasons for the unregistered status. Examples of possible additional 
statements are ``Not Registered for Use on...'', ``No Longer Registered 
for Use...'', or ``Not Registered...because...'' Such additions must not 
be misleading or misrepresent the registration status of the pesticide. 
The statement ``Not Registered For Use in the United States of America'' 
must also be present.
    (A) A pesticide is considered registered for the purposes of the 
section 17(a)(1) requirement only when:
    (1) A label and labeling approved under a current FIFRA section 3 
registration for the product is either attached to the immediate product 
container or accompanies the product at all times as supplemental 
labeling as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) The formula of the exported product is the same as the formula 
of the U.S. registered product (within certified limits). In addition, a 
change in the color or fragrance of the export product will not affect 
the product's registration status, as long as the following conditions 
are met:
    (i) The change in color must result only from the addition of a dye 
included on the list of the chemicals exempted from the requirement of a 
tolerance at 40 CFR 180.910, 180.920, 180.930, and 180.950, and the dye 
must not be a List 1 inert. (List 1 inerts are those inerts which the 
Agency has identified as presenting toxicological concerns. The 
classification of inerts is explained in EPA's Policy Statement on Inert 
Ingredients in Pesticide Products, which can be obtained at the OPP 
Regulatory Public Docket located as set forth in 40 CFR 150.17(c).)
    (ii) The change in fragrance must result only from the addition of a 
chemical included on the list of the chemicals exempted from the 
requirement of a tolerance at 40 CFR 180.910, 180.920, 180.930, and 
180.950, and the chemical must not be a List 1 inert.
    (iii) The change in fragrance must not result in a pesticide product 
containing a food or food-like fragrance. (See ``Food Fragrances in 
Pesticide Formulations,'' EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs Policy and 
Criteria Notice number 2155.1, November 20, 1975, which can be obtained 
at the OPP Regulatory Public Docket located as set forth in 40 CFR 
150.17(c).)
    (iv) Any differences in color or fragrance of the export product in 
accordance with this section must be reflected in records which show the 
complete formula of the export product in accordance with the 
requirements of Sec. 169.2 and this policy.
    (3) No statements which appear on any of the product labels or 
labeling add new uses or claims or in any way contradict the approved 
FIFRA section 3 labeling. However, certain minor changes may be made to 
a product's labeling or packaging without affecting the registration 
status of the product, as specified in Sec. 152.46(b) of this chapter.
    (iv) The ingredient statement. The ingredient statement must appear 
on the label in English and in appropriate foreign languages (as 
described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section). If the English language 
description of the ingredients is easily identifiable and likely to be 
understood by the ordinary individual, the foreign language ingredient 
statement need not be included

[[Page 301]]

on the label. In the case of pesticide products, devices and active 
ingredients shipped solely for research and development purposes, it is 
permissible to use coded identification of ingredients on the label in 
order to protect confidentiality, in accordance with the requirements of 
Sec. Sec. 168.75(c) and 168.85(a).
    (v) Identity of parties. The name and address of the producer, 
registrant (if any), or the person for whom the pesticide was produced, 
must appear on the label.
    (vi) Weight or measure. The net weight must appear on the label in 
either English or metric units.
    (vii) Additional warning for highly toxic pesticides. If the 
pesticide, device or active ingredient is highly toxic to humans, the 
skull and crossbones, the word ``Poison,'' and a first aid statement 
must appear on the label. The word ``Poison'' and the first aid 
statement shall be in English and in the appropriate foreign languages, 
as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The skull and 
crossbones may be in red or black. For criteria on what pesticides are 
highly toxic, see Sec. 156.62 of this chapter.
    (2) Use classification statement. In addition to the label contents 
described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the labeling must include 
a use classification statement, if a use classification has been 
assigned under a FIFRA section 3 registration. The use classification 
shall accurately describe the use classification applicable to the U.S. 
registered use of the pesticide, device or active ingredient (e.g., 
``Restricted Use Pesticide''). Summary statements describing the use 
classification, e.g., ``For retail sale to and use only by Certified 
Applicators...'', or explaining what such terms mean are not required, 
but may be included if such statements do not result in false 
representation of the U.S. regulatory status of the pesticide. The use 
classification information may appear on the product label or on the 
labeling accompanying the pesticide product during shipment.
    (3) Misrepresentation. The labeling shall not make false or 
misleading representations or represent the product as an imitation of 
other products.
    (4) Understandability. The required statements must be expressed in 
such terms as to render them likely to be read and understood by the 
ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use. To 
satisfy this section, certain information described in paragraph 
(b)(4)(i) of this section, which appears on the labeling of all exported 
pesticide products, devices and active ingredients must appear in 
English, in an acceptable language of the country of import as defined 
in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, and in an acceptable language 
of the country of final destination, if known or reasonably 
ascertainable by the exporter. When there are several official languages 
or dialects in a country, the language which is predominately spoken or 
written, or a language in which official government business is 
conducted, will be acceptable.
    (i) Information required to be multilingual. The following labeling 
information must be multilingual:
    (A) The warning and caution statements.
    (B) Where required, the statement ``Not Registered for Use in the 
United States of America.''
    (C) The ingredient statement.
    (D) Where required in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(vii) of this 
section, the word ``Poison'' and the statement of practical treatment in 
case of poisoning.
    (ii) Acceptable languages. In all cases, English must be one of the 
languages used on the label or labeling. In addition, either the 
language which is used to conduct official government business, or the 
predominantly spoken or written language of the country of import must 
appear on the labeling. In each case where a country of final 
destination is known, the language which is used to conduct official 
government business or which is predominantly spoken in that country, if 
different from the language of the country of import, shall also appear 
on the labeling. In any case where English is predominantly spoken or 
written or is the language used to conduct official government business 
in a country, no other language need be included to meet the multiple 
language requirement of this paragraph.

[[Page 302]]

    (c) Supplemental labeling. A pesticide, device or active ingredient 
intended for export will not be considered in violation of the labeling 
requirements of FIFRA when the label and/or labeling requirements stated 
in paragraph (b) of this section are met by supplemental labeling. 
Supplemental labeling must be attached to the immediate product 
container or the shipping container of the pesticide, device or active 
ingredient at all times when it is shipped or held for shipment to meet 
export label requirements. Supplemental labeling must meet all of the 
label requirements in paragraph (b) of this section which are not met by 
the immediate product labels. Supplemental labeling will satisfy the 
labeling requirements of FIFRA only if the following conditions are met:
    (1) Applicability. The use of supplemental labeling applies to any 
situation where the labeling requirements specified in this section are 
not met fully on the product label which is attached to the immediate 
product container. Any required label or labeling statement not met on 
the immediate container may be met through supplemental labeling.
    (2) Labeling contents and relation to shipment. If supplemental 
labeling is used to meet any of the labeling requirements of FIFRA 
section 17(a)(1), it must meet all of the requirements in paragraph (b) 
of this section which are not met by the label on the immediate product 
container. Thus, the supplemental labeling, together with the immediate 
product container label will meet all of the requirements of paragraph 
(b) of this section. Where used, supplemental labeling must be attached 
to or accompany the product shipping container of the pesticide, device, 
or active ingredient used in producing a pesticide at all times when 
shipped or held for shipment in the United States.

<R05>
Sec. 168.75  Procedures for exporting unregistered pesticides--purchaser

acknowledgement statements.

    This section describes how EPA interprets and will enforce 
requirements of FIFRA section 17(a)(2). Section 17(a)(2) provides that 
any person exporting a pesticide other than a pesticide registered for 
use under FIFRA section 3 or sold under FIFRA section 6(a)(1), shall 
obtain a statement signed by the foreign purchaser prior to export, 
acknowledging that the purchaser understands that such pesticide is not 
registered for use in the United States and cannot be sold in the United 
States. Section 17(a)(2) requires that a copy of the statement be 
transmitted to an appropriate official of the government of the 
importing country.
    (a) Products subject to the requirement. EPA will not consider an 
exporter of an unregistered pesticide to be in violation of FIFRA 
section 17(a)(2) if, prior to export of the pesticide, the exporter 
submits to EPA a statement signed by the foreign purchaser which affirms 
that the purchaser is aware that the pesticide is not registered for use 
in the United States and cannot be sold for use in the United States. 
The exporter must also include with the submission of the purchaser 
acknowledgement statement to EPA, a certification signed by the exporter 
affirming that the export did not occur until the statement signed by 
the foreign purchaser was obtained by the exporter. Except as provided 
in paragraph (b) of this section, all pesticide products produced for 
export which cannot be sold for use in the United States in the form 
that they are produced for export, are considered to be unregistered 
pesticides. This includes pesticides which are of a different 
formulation, including composition (except for variation within 
certified limits), or type of formulation, and pesticides which are 
packaged for use patterns for which they are not registered, which may 
be evidenced by package type or label use statements. This also includes 
unregistered products which are under development as pesticidal products 
and which are being exported for research testing.
    (b) Exceptions. Under the specific circumstances discussed below, 
EPA will

[[Page 303]]

not treat a registered product which has been modified slightly for 
export purposes, as unregistered for the purposes of the purchaser 
acknowledgement statement requirement. Any changes to the registered 
product for export purposes must be documented in accordance with the 
record-keeping requirements at Sec. 169.2 of this chapter and this 
policy.
    (1) Labeling on immediate product. EPA will not treat as 
unregistered for the purposes of section 17(a)(2), a registered 
pesticide product which cannot be sold or distributed for use in the 
United States because its immediate product container does not bear a 
label approved under a FIFRA section 3 registration, but which could be 
sold or distributed in the United States with the approved label 
attached to the immediate product container, provided that the label and 
labeling approved under a current FIFRA section 3 registration for the 
product is either attached to the immediate product container or 
accompanies the product at all times as supplemental labeling as 
provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) Packaging. (i) Certain changes may be made to a product's 
labeling or packaging without affecting the registration status of the 
product, as specified in Sec. 152.46(b) of this chapter and this 
policy. These changes include any changes in package size and label net 
contents, provided no change in use directions or requirement for child-
resistant packaging would be necessary for the product to be registered 
for use in the United States. For example, if child-resistant packaging 
is required for a particular pesticide product in the United States, and 
the product will be exported without child-resistant packaging, the 
product would be considered unregistered and therefore subject to all 
the requirements of FIFRA section 17(a), as described in Sec. 168.75 of 
this chapter including the requirement for a purchaser acknowledgement 
statement.
    (ii) If an exporter needed to repackage a product in a size to meet 
a foreign purchaser's specifications, that modification would not affect 
the registration status of the export product. Other modifications to 
the label used for export purposes which will not affect the export 
product's registration status are: the use of metric units for net 
contents, dosages, and other numeric expressions; the use of a different 
format for the label, provided that the information does not contradict 
the U.S. label; revision of non-mandatory U.S. label statements, 
consistent with 40 CFR part 156, including additions or changes required 
by other Federal statutes or regulations; a change of the name or 
address of the registrant, except for a change resulting from transfer 
of ownership, which requires that a registrant keep his name and address 
current with the Agency; and any correction of typographical or printing 
errors that appeared on the U.S. labeling. (See Sec. 152.46(b)).
    (3) Labeling statements. The following statements which appear on 
any of the product labels or labeling will not affect the status of the 
product, provided that they do not contradict the approved FIFRA section 
3 labeling:
    (i) It is permissible to add explanatory language which accurately 
explains the meaning of a use classification. For example, the statement 
``restricted use pesticide'' may be expanded to read: ``Restricted in 
the United States of America to use by certified applicators'' or 
``Restricted Use Pesticide. In The United States this product is 
restricted to use by applicators determined by each state to be 
competent in pesticide application and the human health and 
environmental consequences of misuse.'' If the explanatory language 
falsely represents or is misleading regarding the U.S. use 
classification, the product will be considered misbranded. In addition, 
a use classification can only be listed if one has been assigned 
pursuant to the U.S. registration.
    (ii) An exporter who is also the manufacturer of a U.S. registered 
pesticide may add new uses to the label of that product for export 
purposes, without triggering the requirements of section 17(a)(2), as 
long as the new uses are within the same general use patterns as those 
for the registered product. The general pesticide use patterns are: 
terrestrial food crop and terrestrial non-food crop; greenhouse food 
crop and

[[Page 304]]

greenhouse nonfood crop; aquatic food crop and aquatic nonfood crop' 
indoor use' and forestry use. Adding new uses to the label which change 
the use pattern, such as changes from nonfood to food use, outdoor to 
indoor use, or terrestrial to aquatic use, render the product 
unregistered and subject to the requirements of section 17 for 
unregistered products. If the new use added to the label is a food or 
feed use, a tolerance must already be established for the use of that 
pesticide in or on that commodity.
    (4) Composition. EPA will not treat a registered product as 
unregistered for the purposes of the purchaser acknowledgement statement 
requirement under the following specific circumstances:
    (i) The formula of the exported product is within certified limits 
of the formula of the U.S. registered product.
    (ii) An exporter, who is also the manufacturer of a U.S. registered 
pesticide, may decrease the percentage of the active ingredient(s) of 
that product by adding a List 4 inert ingredient, without causing the 
product to be treated as ``unregistered'' and triggering the requirement 
to obtain a purchaser acknowledgement statement as a condition for 
export. In EPA's Policy Statement on Inert Ingredients in Pesticide 
Products, EPA included inert ingredients on List 4-a list of inert 
ingredients posing minimal hazard or risk-if the inert ingredients were 
generally regarded as innocuous. The provisions of this paragraph do not 
apply to those pesticide products intended for public health uses which 
are required or conditionally required to submit efficacy data pursuant 
to Sec. 158.400 or Sec. 161.640 of this chapter, as applicable. Any 
differences in formula or composition caused by adding a List 4 inert 
must be reflected in records which show the complete formula of the 
export product in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 169.2 and 
this policy.
    (iii) A change in the color or fragrance of the export product will 
not affect the product's registration status as long as the following 
conditions are met. The change in color must result only from the 
addition of a dye included on the list of the chemicals exempted from 
the requirement of a tolerance at 40 CFR 180.910, 180.920, 180.930, and 
180.950, and the dye must not be a List 1 inert. (List 1 inerts are 
those inerts which the Agency has identified as presenting toxicological 
concerns. The classification of inerts is explained in EPA's Policy 
Statement on Inert Ingredients in Pesticide Products. The change in 
fragrance must result only from the addition of a chemical included on 
the list of the chemicals exempted from the requirement of a tolerance 
at 40 CFR 180.910, 180.920, 180.930, and 180.950, and the chemical must 
not be a List 1 inert. The change in fragrance must not result in a 
pesticide product containing a food or food-like fragrance. (See ``Food 
Fragrances in Pesticide Formulations,'' EPA's Office of Pesticide 
Programs Policy and Criteria Notice number 2155.1, November 20, 1975.) 
Any difference in color or fragrance of the export product in accordance 
with this section must be reflected in records which show the complete 
formula of the export product in accordance with the requirements of 
Sec. 169.2 and this policy.
    (5) Research and development products. An unregistered pesticide 
product exported only for research and development purposes is subject 
to the notification requirements of this section, unless its use fits 
within the criteria described in this paragraph.
    (i) An unregistered pesticide product exported solely for research 
and development purposes will not be considered to be in violation of 
the notification requirements if the export of the research and 
development product:
    (A) Would not involve land uses of more than 10 acres (4.05 
hectares), or be used on or affect food or feed crops which are intended 
for consumption.
    (B) Would not involve aquatic uses of more than 1 acre (0.405 
hectares), or any aquatic uses which involve water used for irrigation, 
drinking or recreation, or be used on or affect plants or animals taken 
for food or feed from such waters.
    (C) Would not involve tests on animals intended for food or feed.
    (ii) Shipments to different purchasers, to different countries of 
final destination, or which occur more than a calendar year apart will 
be evaluated separately. When determining whether

[[Page 305]]

total shipments exceed the criteria described in this paragraph, EPA 
will evaluate the total amount of shipments by a single exporter during 
a calendar year for use in a particular country.
    (iii) An exporter bears the burden of demonstrating that the product 
meets these criteria before the research product is shipped. This may be 
met by documenting before the product is shipped and maintaining records 
for the time period required by Sec. 169.2(h) of this chapter from the 
date of the last shipment relevant to such records. The records to be 
maintained consist of:
    (A) The identity of the purchaser and country of intended use of the 
research product.
    (B) The amount shipped.
    (C) The intended research use by the purchaser, including the type 
of application site, rate of application, and measures taken for 
protection of humans from direct or dietary exposure.
    (c) Procedures. An exporter of an unregistered pesticide product 
must submit a purchaser acknowledgement statement to EPA containing the 
information stated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and a statement 
signed by the exporter certifying that the exportation did not occur 
until the signed acknowledgement statement had been obtained from the 
purchaser. If the foreign purchaser signs a purchaser acknowledgement 
statement in their own language, it must be accompanied by an English 
translation when it is submitted to EPA by the exporter. These 
statements shall be submitted in accordance with one of the two options 
for submission described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (1) Contents of the purchaser acknowledgement statements. The 
purchaser acknowledgement statement must include the following 
information in a format that is clearly understandable:
    (i) Name, address, and EPA identification number, if applicable, of 
the exporter.
    (ii) Name and address of the foreign purchaser.
    (iii) Identity of the product and the active ingredient(s), 
including:
    (A) The Chemical Abstract Services (CAS) Registry number for each 
active ingredient.
    (B) The chemical nomenclature for each active ingredient as used by 
the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemists (IUPAC).
    (C) Other known chemical or common names; or if the export involves 
a research product, a code name or identification number that can be 
used by EPA to identify the product from the exporter's records. If a 
code name or identification number is used, additional information must 
be attached to the certification statement submitted with the purchaser 
acknowledgement statement which will enable EPA to identify the product. 
This attached information may be claimed as confidential, and EPA will 
not forward this information with the purchaser acknowledgement 
statement to foreign governments.
    (iv) If known or reasonably ascertainable, the country or countries 
of final destination of the export shipment, i.e., where the exported 
pesticide is intended to be used, if different from the country of the 
foreign purchaser's address.
    (v) A statement that indicates that the foreign purchaser 
understands that the product is not registered for use in the United 
States and cannot be sold in the United States.
    (vi) The signature of the foreign purchaser.
    (vii) The date of the foreign purchaser's signature.
    (2) Reporting options. At the discretion of the exporter, the 
requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section may be met on a per-
shipment or annual basis, as stated in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and 
(c)(2)(ii) of this section. If the procedures in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of 
this section are not followed, EPA will consider paragraph (c)(2)(i) of 
this section, requiring pershipment purchaser acknowledgement 
statements, to be applicable in full. Where paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this 
section is applicable, each shipment which does not meet the 
requirements of that paragraph will be considered to be a separate 
violation of FIFRA.
    (i) Per-shipment purchaser acknowledgment statement. Unless the 
exporter chooses to follow the procedures described in paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii) of this

[[Page 306]]

section for the annual reporting procedures, the exporter must obtain 
and submit to EPA, a signed purchaser acknowledgement statement prior to 
each shipment of an unregistered pesticide according to the following 
procedures:
    (A) Prior to each shipment in a calendar year of an unregistered 
pesticide product to a particular purchaser in a foreign country, the 
exporter must provide the foreign purchaser with instructions about the 
required information on a purchaser acknowledgement statement, and 
inform the foreign purchaser that the pesticide product cannot be 
exported from the United States until the exporter has received from the 
foreign purchaser a properly completed, signed, and dated acknowledgment 
statement.
    (B) The exporter must obtain, prior to each shipment in a calendar 
year of an unregistered pesticide product to a particular purchaser in a 
foreign country, a signed purchaser acknowledgment statement which 
contains the information set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (C) The exporter must sign a statement certifying that export did 
not take place until a signed purchaser acknowledgement statement was 
received. The exporter must also specify the chemical identity of any 
research product which is referred to by code in the purchaser 
acknowledgement statement. The information regarding the specific 
identity of research products, which may be included in the statement or 
consist of an attachment to the certification, may be claimed as 
confidential.
    (D) The exporter must submit the signed acknowledgement statement 
from the foreign purchaser, and the accompanying certification by the 
exporter including attachments, to EPA within 7 working days of the 
exporter's receipt of the purchaser acknowledgement statement, or by the 
date of export, whichever occurs first. This information must be 
transmitted to the Office of Pesticide Programs' Document Processing 
Desk at the appropriate address as set forth in 40 CFR 150.17(a) or (b), 
Attention: Purchaser Acknowledgement Statement.
    (ii) Annual reporting procedures. Unless the exporter chooses to 
follow the per-shipment reporting option described in paragraph 
(c)(2)(i) of this section, the exporter must follow the procedures for 
annual summary reporting which include the requirement of a purchaser 
acknowledgement statement for the first shipment each calendar year of 
an unregistered pesticide product to a particular purchaser, and an 
annual summary of shipments to that purchaser. The annual summary 
reporting procedures are as follows:
    (A) Prior to the first shipment each calendar year of an 
unregistered pesticide product to a particular purchaser in a foreign 
country, the exporter must provide the foreign purchaser with 
instructions about the required information on a purchaser 
acknowledgement statement, and inform the foreign purchaser that the 
pesticide product cannot be exported from the United States until the 
exporter has received from the foreign purchaser a properly completed, 
signed, and dated purchaser acknowledgement statement.
    (B) The exporter must obtain, prior to the first shipment each 
calendar year of an unregistered pesticide product to a particular 
purchaser in a foreign country, a signed purchaser acknowledgement 
statement which contains the information set forth in paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section.
    (C) The exporter must sign a statement certifying that export did 
not take place until a signed purchaser acknowledgement statement was 
received, indicating that this statement is for the first shipment to a 
particular purchaser in a specific country for that calendar year, and 
that the exporter will meet all the purchaser acknowledgement statement 
requirements as described in this paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. 
The exporter must also specify the chemical identity of any research 
product which is referred to by code in the purchaser acknowledgement 
statement. The information regarding the specific identity of research 
products, which may be included in the statement or consist of an 
attachment to the certification, may be claimed as confidential.

[[Page 307]]

    (D) The exporter must submit the signed acknowledgement statement 
from the foreign purchaser, and the accompanying certification by the 
exporter including attachments, to EPA within 7 working days of the 
exporter's receipt of the purchaser acknowledgement statement, or by the 
date of export, whichever occurs first. This information must be 
transmitted to the Office of Pesticide Programs' Document Processing 
Desk at the appropriate address as set forth in 40 CFR 150.17(a) or (b), 
Attention: Purchaser Acknowledgement Statement.
    (E) The exporter, who has chosen to comply with the requirements of 
this paragraph instead of providing per-shipment purchaser 
acknowledgement statements in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(i) of 
this section, must submit an annual summary report to EPA. An annual 
summary report is required for each unregistered pesticide exported 
within the preceding calendar year. The report must be in writing, 
signed by the exporter, and include the following information:
    (1) Name, address, and EPA identification number if applicable, of 
the exporter.
    (2) Name and address of the foreign purchaser, and the date the 
purchaser acknowledgement statement, submitted to EPA during the 
previous calendar year, was signed by the purchaser.
    (3) The identity of the product and the active ingredients, 
including: the Chemical Abstract Services (CAS) registry number for each 
active ingredient, the chemical nomenclature for each active ingredient 
used by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemists (IUPAC), 
and other known chemical or common names, or if the export involves a 
research product, the code name or identification number that can be 
used by EPA to identify the product from the exporter's records.
    (4) The dates of each shipment of the pesticide exported to the 
foreign purchaser during that calendar year.
    (5) If known, or reasonably ascertainable, the country or countries 
of final destination of the export shipments, i.e., where the exported 
pesticide was intended to be used, if different from the foreign 
purchaser's address.
    (F) The exporter shall submit the annual summary no later than March 
1st of the following calendar year. The annual summary shall be sent to 
the Office of Pesticide Programs' Document Processing Desk at the 
appropriate address as set forth in 40 CFR 150.17(a) or (b), Attention: 
Annual Summary of Exports.
    (iii) Confidentiality claims. Persons submitting the information 
specified in the purchaser acknowledgement statement may assert a claim 
of business confidentiality by marking the information claimed 
confidential as ``FIFRA Confidential Business Information.'' Information 
so claimed will not be disclosed, with the exception of disclosure to 
the foreign governments, except in accordance with the procedures set 
forth in 40 CFR part 2, 7 U.S.C. 136(h), and this policy statement. If 
such claim is not asserted, EPA may disclose the information to the 
public without providing further notice prior to disclosure or an 
opportunity to object. Notwithstanding any claim of confidentiality, the 
purchaser acknowledgement statement will continue to be forwarded to the 
appropriate foreign government officials in its entirety, as required by 
section 17(a)(2).
    (3) Recordkeeping. Except as specifically stated, the requirement to 
retain records under part 169 of this chapter applies to all pesticide 
producers, regardless of whether a particular product is intended for 
export. All records shall be maintained in accordance with the time 
period required by Sec. 169.2(h) of this chapter. Producers must also 
maintain certain records pertaining to pesticide products intended for 
export. In addition to the requirement that a copy of the purchaser 
acknowledgement statement be kept, as stated at Sec. 169.2(h)(3) of 
this chapter, the following records must be maintained:
    (i) Copies of the instructions provided to foreign purchasers in 
accordance with paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(A) and (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this 
section.
    (ii) Copies of signed purchaser acknowledgement statements obtained 
according to paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(B) and (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.

[[Page 308]]

    (iii) Copies of the certification from the exporter; and copies of 
any accompanying information regarding the identity of coded R&D 
products.
    (d) Agency transmission of purchaser acknowledgement statements. EPA 
will transmit a copy of each purchaser acknowledgement statement to the 
appropriate government official in each of the intended destination 
countries. After receipt of the Annual Summary the following calendar 
year, EPA will also transmit a copy of that document to the appropriate 
government official in each of the intended destination countries. In 
the case that no Annual Summary has been received within 30 days of the 
date at which such summary is required to be submitted, EPA will send 
written notification to the appropriate government official indicating 
that no summary was submitted, and may also take enforcement action 
against the exporter.

Sec. 168.85  Other export requirements.

    This section describes other requirements found in regulations that 
apply to exporters of pesticides, devices, and active ingredients used 
in producing a pesticide.
    (a) Recordkeeping and inspection. Exporters of pesticides, devices 
and active ingredients must keep records and permit inspections of those 
records in accordance with part 169 of this chapter. Exporters must keep 
records of the product labeling used, including the EPA registered

shows exactly which labels and labeling accompanied each shipment of a 
pesticide product to a foreign country. As stated at Sec. 168.75(c), 
when research product identity information appears on the labeling in an 
encoded manner, information translating the code shall be maintained in 
records. These records shall be maintained for the time period required 
by Sec. 169.2(h) of this chapter following the last export of such 
pesticides. All records required by part 169 of this chapter shall be 
made available for inspection and copying by EPA or its duly authorized 
representatives.
    (b) Pesticide production establishment requirements. Exporters of 
pesticides, devices, and active ingredients must submit annual reports 
to EPA in accordance with part 167 of this chapter, concerning those 
products that are exported. All products required to be labeled ``Not 
Registered for Use in the United States of America'' must be reported as 
unregistered production regardless of whether a purchaser 
acknowledgement statement is required.

    (a) Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 
U.S.C. 136 et seq.) (FIFRA) section 12(a)(2)(G) it is unlawful for any 
person ``to use any registered pesticide in a manner inconsistent with 
its labeling.'' When this part is referenced on a label, users must 
comply with all of its requirements except those that are inconsistent 
with product-specific instructions on the labeling. For the purposes of 
this part, EPA interprets the term ``use'' to include:
    (1) Preapplication activities, including, but not limited to:
    (i) Arranging for the application of the pesticide;
    (ii) Mixing and loading the pesticide; and
    (iii) Making necessary preparations for the application of the 
pesticide, including responsibilities related to worker notification, 
training of handlers, decontamination, use and care of personal 
protective equipment, emergency information, and heat stress management.
    (2) Application of the pesticide.
    (3) Post-application activities necessary to reduce the risks of 
illness and injury resulting from handlers' and workers' occupational 
exposures to pesticide residues during the restricted-entry interval 
plus 30 days. These activities include, but are not limited to, 
responsibilities related to worker training, notification, and 
decontamination.
    (4) Other pesticide-related activities, including, but not limited 
to, providing emergency assistance, transporting or storing pesticides 
that have been opened, and disposing of excess pesticides, spray mix, 
equipment wash waters, pesticide containers, and other pesticide-
containing materials.
    (b) A person who has a duty under this part, as referenced on the 
pesticide product label, and who fails to perform that duty, violates 
FIFRA section 12(a)(2)(G) and is subject to a civil penalty under 
section 14. A person who knowingly violates section 12(a)(2)(G) is 
subject to section 14 criminal sanctions.
    (c) FIFRA section 14(b)(4) provides that a person is liable for a 
penalty under FIFRA if another person employed by or acting for that 
person violates any provision of FIFRA. The term ``acting for'' includes 
both employment and contractual relationships.
    (d) The requirements of this part, including the decontamination 
requirements, shall not, for the purposes of section 653(b)(1) of title 
29 of the U.S. Code, be deemed to be the exercise of statutory authority 
to prescribe or enforce standards or regulations affecting the general 
sanitary hazards addressed by the OSHA Field Sanitation Standard, 29 CFR 
1928.110, or other agricultural, nonpesticide hazards.

Sec. 170.112  Entry restrictions.

    (a) General restrictions. (1) After the application of any pesticide 
on an agricultural establishment, the agricultural employer shall not 
allow or direct any worker to enter or to remain in the treated area 
before the restricted-entry interval specified on the pesticide labeling 
has expired, except as provided in this section.
    (2) Entry-restricted areas in greenhouses are specified in column D 
in table 2 under Sec. 170.110(c)(4).
    (3) When two or more pesticides are applied at the same time, the 
restricted-entry interval shall be the longest of the applicable 
intervals.
    (4) The agricultural employer shall assure that any worker who 
enters a treated area under a restricted-entry interval as permitted by 
paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section uses the personal 
protective equipment specified in the product labeling for early-entry 
workers and follows any other requirements on the pesticide labeling 
regarding early entry.
    (b) Exception for activities with no contact. A worker may enter a 
treated area during a restricted-entry interval if the agricultural 
employer assures that both of the following are met:
    (1) The worker will have no contact with anything that has been 
treated with the pesticide to which the restricted-entry interval 
applies, including, but not limited to, soil, water, air, or surfaces of 
plants; and
    (2) No such entry is allowed until any inhalation exposure level 
listed in the labeling has been reached or any ventilation criteria 
established by Sec. 170.110(c)(3) or in the labeling have been met.

[[Page 318]]

    (c) Exception for short-term activities. A worker may enter a 
treated area during a restricted-entry interval for short-term 
activities if the agricultural employer assures that the following 
requirements are met:
    (1) No hand labor activity is performed.
    (2) The time in treated areas under a restricted-entry interval for 
any worker does not exceed 1 hour in any 24-hour period.
    (3) No such entry is allowed for the first 4 hours following the end 
of the application, and no such entry is allowed thereafter until any 
inhalation exposure level listed in the labeling has been reached or any 
ventilation criteria established by Sec. 170.110(c)(3) or in the 
labeling have been met.
    (4) The personal protective equipment specified on the product 
labeling for early entry is provided to the worker. Such personal 
protective equipment shall conform to the following standards:
    (i) Personal protective equipment (PPE) means devices and apparel 
that are worn to protect the body from contact with pesticides or 
pesticide residues, including, but not limited to, coveralls, chemical-
resistant suits, chemical-resistant gloves, chemical-resistant footwear, 
respiratory protection devices, chemical-resistant aprons, chemical-
resistant headgear, and protective eyewear.
    (ii) Long-sleeved shirts, short-sleeved shirts, long pants, short 
pants, shoes, socks, and other items of work clothing are not considered 
personal protective equipment for the purposes of this section and are 
not subject to the requirements of this section, although pesticide 
labeling may require that such work clothing be worn during some 
activities.
    (iii) When ``chemical-resistant'' personal protective equipment is 
specified by the product labeling, it shall be made of material that 
allows no measurable movement of the pesticide being used through the 
material during use.
    (iv) When ``waterproof'' personal protective equipment is specified 
by the product labeling, it shall be made of material that allows no 
measurable movement of water or aqueous solutions through the material 
during use.
    (v) When a ``chemical-resistant suit'' is specified by the product 
labeling, it shall be a loose-fitting, one- or two-piece, chemical-
resistant garment that covers, at a minimum, the entire body except 
head, hands, and feet.
    (vi) When ``coveralls'' are specified by the product labeling, they 
shall be a loose-fitting, one- or two-piece garment, such as a cotton or 
cotton and polyester coverall, that covers, at a minimum, the entire 
body except head, hands, and feet. The pesticide product labeling may 
specify that the coveralls be worn over a layer of clothing. If a 
chemical-resistant suit is substituted for coveralls, it need not be 
worn over a layer of clothing.
    (vii)(A) Gloves shall be of the type specified on the pesticide 
product labeling. Gloves made of leather, cotton, or other absorbent 
materials must not be worn for early-entry activities, unless gloves 
made of these materials are listed as acceptable for such use on the 
product labeling. If chemical-resistant gloves with sufficient 
durability and suppleness are not obtainable, leather gloves may be worn 
on top of chemical-resistant gloves. However, once leather gloves have 
been worn for this use, they shall not be worn thereafter for any other 
purpose, and they shall only be worn over chemical-resistant gloves.
    (B) Separable glove liners may be worn beneath chemical-resistant 
gloves, unless the pesticide product labeling specifically prohibits 
their use. Separable glove liners are defined as separate glove-like 
hand coverings made of lightweight material, with or without fingers. 
Work gloves made from lightweight cotton or poly-type material are 
considered to be glove liners if worn beneath chemical-resistant gloves. 
Separable glove liners may not extend outside the chemical-resistant 
gloves under which they are worn. Chemical-resistant gloves with non-
separable absorbent lining materials are prohibited.
    (C) If used, separable glove liners must be discarded immediately 
after a total of no more than 10 hours of use or within 24 hours of when 
first put on, whichever comes first. The liners must be replaced 
immediately if directly contacted by pesticide. Used glove liners shall 
not be reused. Contaminated

[[Page 319]]

liners must be disposed of in accordance with any Federal, State, or 
local regulations.
    (viii) When ``chemical-resistant footwear'' is specified by the 
product labeling, it shall be one of the following types of footwear: 
chemical-resistant shoes, chemical-resistant boots, or chemical-
resistant shoe coverings worn over shoes or boots. If chemical-resistant 
footwear with sufficient durability and a tread appropriate for wear in 
rough terrain is not obtainable for workers, then leather boots may be 
worn in such terrain.
    (ix) When ``protective eyewear'' is specified by the product 
labeling, it shall be one of the following types of eyewear: goggles; 
face shield; safety glasses with front, brow, and temple protection; or 
a full-face respirator.
    (x) When ``chemical-resistant headgear'' is specified by the product 
labeling, it shall be either a chemical-resistant hood or a chemical-
resistant hat with a wide brim.
    (5) The agricultural employer shall assure that the worker, before 
entering the treated area, either has read the product labeling or has 
been informed, in a manner that the worker can understand, of all 
labeling requirements related to human hazards or precautions, first 
aid, symptoms of poisoning, personal protective equipment specified for 
early entry, and any other labeling requirements related to safe use.
    (6) The agricultural employer shall assure that:
    (i) Workers wear the personal protective equipment correctly for its 
intended purpose and use personal protective equipment according to 
manufacturer's instructions.
    (ii) Before each day of use, all personal protective equipment is 
inspected for leaks, holes, tears, or worn places, and any damaged 
equipment is repaired or discarded.
    (iii) Personal protective equipment that cannot be cleaned properly 
is disposed of in accordance with any applicable Federal, State, and 
local regulations.
    (iv) All personal protective equipment is cleaned according to 
manufacturer's instructions or pesticide product labeling instructions 
before each day of reuse. In the absence of any such instructions, it 
shall be washed thoroughly in detergent and hot water.
    (v) Before being stored, all clean personal protective equipment is 
dried thoroughly or is put in a well-ventilated place to dry.
    (vi) Personal protective equipment contaminated with pesticides is 
kept separately and washed separately from any other clothing or 
laundry.
    (vii) Any person who cleans or launders personal protective 
equipment is informed that such equipment may be contaminated with 
pesticides, of the potentially harmful effects of exposure to 
pesticides, and of the correct way(s) to handle and clean personal 
protective equipment and to protect themselves when handling equipment 
contaminated with pesticides.
    (viii) All clean personal protective equipment is stored separately 
from personal clothing and apart from pesticide-contaminated areas.
    (ix) Each worker is instructed how to put on, use, and remove the 
personal protective equipment and is informed about the importance of 
washing thoroughly after removing personal protective equipment.
    (x) Each worker is instructed in the prevention, recognition, and 
first aid treatment of heat-related illness.
    (xi) Workers have a clean place(s) away from pesticide-storage and 
pesticide-use areas for storing personal clothing not in use; putting on 
personal protective equipment at the start of any exposure period; and 
removing personal protective equipment at the end of any exposure 
period.
    (7) When personal protective equipment is required by the labeling 
of any pesticide for early entry, the agricultural employer shall assure 
that no worker is allowed or directed to perform the early-entry 
activity without implementing, when appropriate, measures to prevent 
heat-related illness.
    (8) During any early-entry activity, the agricultural employer shall 
provide a decontamination site in accordance with Sec. 170.150.
    (9) The agricultural employer shall not allow or direct any worker 
to wear

[[Page 320]]

home or to take home personal protective equipment contaminated with 
pesticides.
    (d) Exception for an agricultural emergency. (1) An ``agricultural 
emergency'' means a sudden occurrence or set of circumstances which the 
agricultural employer could not have anticipated and over which the 
agricultural employer has no control, and which requires entry into a 
treated area during a restricted-entry interval, when no alternative 
practices would prevent or mitigate a substantial economic loss. A 
substantial economic loss means a loss in profitability greater than 
that which would be expected based on the experience and fluctuations of 
crop yields in previous years. Only losses caused by the agricultural 
emergency specific to the affected site and geographic area are 
considered. The contribution of mismanagement cannot be considered in 
determining the loss.
    (2) A worker may enter a treated area under a restricted-entry 
interval in an agricultural emergency to perform tasks, including hand 
labor tasks, necessary to mitigate the effects of the agricultural 
emergency, if the agricultural employer assures that all the following 
criteria are met:
    (i) A State, Tribal, or Federal Agency having jurisdiction declares 
the existence of circumstances that could cause an agricultural 
emergency on that agricultural establishment.
    (ii) The agricultural employer determines the agricultural 
establishment is subject to the circumstances declared under paragraph 
(d)(2)(i) of this section that result in an agricultural emergency 
meeting the criteria of paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (iii) The requirements of paragraphs (c) (3) through (9) of this 
section are met.
    (e) Exception requiring Agency approval. The Agency may, in 
accordance with paragraphs (e) (1) through (3) of this section, grant an 
exception from the requirements of this section. An exception may be 
withdrawn in accordance with paragraph (e)(6) of this section.
    (1) Exception requiring agency approval. A request for an exception 
must be submitted to the Office of Pesticide Programs' Document 
Processing Desk at the appropriate address as set forth in 40 CFR 
150.17(a) or (b) and must be accompanied by two copies of the following 
information:
    (i) The name, address, and telephone number of the submitter.
    (ii) The time period for which the exception is requested.
    (iii) A description of the crop(s) and specific crop production 
task(s) for which the exception is requested. Such a description must 
include an explanation as to the necessity of applying pesticides of a 
type and at a frequency such that the restricted-entry interval would 
interfere with necessary and time-sensitive hand labor tasks for the 
period for which the exception is sought.
    (iv) A description of the geographic area for which the exception is 
requested. If the exception request is for a limited geographic area, 
the explanation must include a description as to why the circumstances 
of exposure or economic impact resulting from the prohibition of routine 
hand labor tasks during the restricted-entry interval are unique to the 
geographic area named in the exception.
    (v) An explanation as to why, for each requested crop-task 
combination, alternative practices would not be technically or 
financially viable. Such alternative practices might include: 
rescheduling the pesticide application or hand labor activity; using a 
non-chemical pest control alternative; using an alternative to the hand 
labor tasks, such as machine cultivation; or substituting a pesticide 
with a shorter restricted-entry interval. This information should 
include estimates or data on per acre revenue and cost of production for 
the crop and area for which the exception is requested. These estimates 
or data should include: the situation prior to implementation of this 
final rule, the situation after implementation of this final rule if the 
exception is not granted, the situation after implementation of this 
final rule if the exception is granted, and specific information on 
individual factors which cause differences in revenues and costs among 
the three situations.
    (vi) A description or documentation of the safety and feasibility of 
such an exception, including, but not limited

[[Page 321]]

to, the feasibility of performing the necessary hand labor activity 
while wearing the personal protective equipment required for early entry 
for the pesticide(s) expected to be applied, the means of mitigating 
heat-related illness concerns, the period of time required daily per 
worker to perform the hand labor activity, any suggested methods of 
reducing the worker's exposure, and any other mitigating factors, such 
as the availability of running water for routine and emergency 
decontamination and mechanical devices that would reduce the workers' 
contact with the treated surfaces. The information should include the 
costs associated with early-entry, such as decontamination facilities, 
special information and training for the workers, heat stress avoidance 
procedures, and provision, inspection, cleaning, and maintenance of 
personal protective equipment. EPA will not grant exceptions where the 
costs of early entry equal or exceed the expected loss in value of crop 
yield or quality.
    (2) Notice of receipt. (i) When a request for an exception is 
submitted to the Agency along with all of the information required in 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the Agency shall issue a notice in the 
Federal Register stating that an exception is being considered, 
describing the nature of the exception, and allowing at least 30 days 
for interested parties to comment.
    (ii) If a request for an exception is submitted to the Agency 
without all of the information required in paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section, the Agency shall return the request to the submitter.
    (3) Exception decision. EPA will publish in the Federal Register its 
decision whether to grant the request for exception. EPA will base its 
decision on whether the benefits of the exception outweigh the costs, 
including the value of the health risks attributable to the exception. 
If the exception is granted, the notice will state the nature of and 
reasons for the exception.
    (4) Presumptive denial. (i) Except as provided in paragraph 
(e)(4)(ii) of this section, persons requesting an exception may assume 
that the exception has been denied if EPA has not issued its decision 
whether to grant the exception within 9 months from the comment-closure 
date specified in the Federal Register notice in which the Agency 
announced, in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section, that it 
would consider the exception.
    (ii) Persons requesting an exception may not assume that the request 
has been denied as provided by paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section if 
the Agency has taken action to extend its review period for a specified 
time interval due to the complexity of the exception request or to the 
number of exception requests concurrently under Agency review. EPA shall 
state the reason(s) for the delay in issuing a decision on the exception 
request. A notice of such an action may be published in the Federal 
Register or persons who requested the exception may be directly notified 
of the action.
    (5) Agricultural employer duties. When a worker enters a treated 
area during a restricted-entry interval under an exception granted under 
paragraph (e) of this section, the agricultural employer shall assure 
that the requirements of paragraphs (c) (3) through (9) of this section 
are met, unless the notice granting the exception specifically indicates 
otherwise.
    (6) Withdrawing an exception. An exception may be withdrawn by the 
Agency at any time if the Agency receives poisoning information or other 
data that indicate that the health risks imposed by this early-entry 
exception are unacceptable or if the Agency receives other information 
that indicates that the exception is no longer necessary or prudent. If 
the Agency determines that an exception should be withdrawn, it will 
publish a notice in the Federal Register, stating the basis for its 
determination. Affected parties would then have 30 days to request a 
hearing on the Agency's determination. The exception, however, would be 
discontinued as of the date specified by EPA in the notice, which may 
include any of the 30-day period and the time required for any 
subsequent hearing process. Thereafter the Agency will decide whether to 
withdraw the exception and will publish a notice in the Federal Register 
stating its decision.

Sec. 170.120  Notice of applications.

    (a) Notification to workers of pesticide applications in 
greenhouses. The agricultural employer shall notify workers of any 
pesticide application in the greenhouse in accordance with this 
paragraph.
    (1) All pesticide applications shall be posted in accordance with 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) If the pesticide product labeling has a statement requiring both 
the posting of treated areas and oral notification to workers, the 
agricultural employer shall also provide oral notification of the 
application to the worker in accordance with paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (3) Notice need not be given to a worker if the agricultural 
employer can assure that one of the following is met:
    (i) From the start of the application until the end of the 
application and during any restricted-entry interval, the worker will 
not enter, work in, remain in, or pass through the greenhouse; or
    (ii) The worker applied (or supervised the application of) the 
pesticide for which the notice is intended and is aware of all 
information required by paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (b) Notification to workers on farms, in nurseries, or in forests of 
pesticide applications. The agricultural employer shall notify workers 
of any pesticide application on the farm or in the nursery or forest in 
accordance with this paragraph.
    (1) If the pesticide product labeling has a statement requiring both 
the posting of treated areas and oral notification to workers, the 
agricultural employer shall post signs in accordance with paragraph (c) 
of this section and shall provide oral notification of the application 
to the worker in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) For any pesticide other than those for which the labeling 
requires both posting and oral notification of applications, the 
agricultural employer shall give notice of the application to the worker 
either by the posting of warning signs in accordance with paragraph (c) 
of this section or orally in accordance with paragraph (d) of this 
section, and shall inform the workers as to which method of notification 
is in effect.
    (3) Notice need not be given to a worker if the agricultural 
employer can assure that one of the following is met:
    (i) From the start of the application until the end of the 
application and during any restricted-entry interval, the worker will 
not enter, work in, remain in, or pass through on foot the treated area 
or any area within 1/4 mile of the treated area; or
    (ii) The worker applied (or supervised the application of) the 
pesticide for which the notice is intended and is aware of all 
information required by (d)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (c) Posted warning signs. The agricultural employer shall post 
warning signs in accordance with the following criteria:
    (1) The warning sign shall have a background color that contrasts 
with red. The words ``DANGER'' and ``PELIGRO,'' plus ``PESTICIDES'' and 
``PESTICIDAS,'' shall be at the top of the sign, and the words ``KEEP 
OUT'' and ``NO ENTRE'' shall be at the bottom of the sign. Letters for 
all words

[[Page 323]]

must be clearly legible. A circle containing an upraised hand on the 
left and a stern face on the right must be near the center of the sign. 
The inside of the circle must be red, except that the hand and a large 
portion of the face must be in a shade that contrasts with red. The 
length of the hand must be at least twice the height of the smallest 
letters. The length of the face must be only slightly smaller than the 
hand. Additional information such as the name of the pesticide and the 
date of application may appear on the warning sign if it does not 
detract from the appearance of the sign or change the meaning of the 
required information. A black-and-white example of a warning sign 
meeting these requirements, other than the size requirements, follows:

[[Page 324]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.111

    (2) The standard sign shall be at least 14 inches by 16 inches with 
letters at least 1 inch in height. Farms and forests shall use the 
standard size sign unless a smaller sign is necessary because the 
treated area is too small to accommodate a sign of this size. In 
nurseries and greenhouses, the agricultural employer may, at any time, 
use a sign smaller than the standard size sign. Whenever a small sign is 
used on any establishment, there are specific posting distances 
depending on the size of the lettering and symbol on the sign. If a sign 
is used with DANGER and PELIGRO in letters at least \7/8\ inch in height 
and the remaining letters at least \1/2\ inch in height and a red circle

[[Page 325]]

at least 3 inches in diameter containing an upraised hand and a stern 
face, the signs shall be no further than 50 feet apart. If a sign is 
used with DANGER and PELIGRO in letters at least \7/16\ inch in height 
and the remaining letters at least \1/4\ inch in height and a red circle 
at least 1\1/2\ inches in diameter containing an upraised hand and a 
stern face, the signs shall be no further than 25 feet apart. A sign 
with DANGER and PELIGRO in letters less than \7/16\ inch in height or 
with any words in letters less than \1/4\ inch in height or a red circle 
smaller than 1\1/2\ inches in diameter containing an upraised hand and a 
stern face will not satisfy the requirements of the rule. All signs must 
meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (3) The employer may replace the Spanish portion of the warning sign 
with a non-English language read by the largest group of workers who do 
not read English. The replacement sign must be in the same format as the 
original sign and be visible and legible.
    (4) On farms and in forests and nurseries, the signs shall be 
visible from all usual points of worker entry to the treated area, 
including at least each access road, each border with any labor camp 
adjacent to the treated area, and each footpath and other walking route 
that enters the treated area. When there are no usual points of worker 
entry, signs shall be posted in the corners of the treated area or in 
any other location affording maximum visibility.
    (5) In greenhouses, the signs shall be posted so they are visible 
from all usual points of worker entry to the treated area including each 
aisle or other walking route that enters the treated area. When there 
are no usual points of worker entry to the treated area, signs shall be 
posted in the corners of the treated area or in any other location 
affording maximum visibility.
    (6) The signs shall:
    (i) Be posted no sooner than 24 hours before the scheduled 
application of the pesticide.
    (ii) Remain posted throughout the application and any restricted-
entry interval.
    (iii) Be removed within 3 days after the end of the application and 
any restricted-entry interval and before agricultural-worker entry is 
permitted, other than entry permitted by Sec. 170.112.
    (7) The signs shall remain visible and legible during the time they 
are posted.
    (8) When several contiguous areas are to be treated with pesticides 
on a rotating or sequential basis, the entire area may be posted. Worker 
entry, other than entry permitted by Sec. 170.112, is prohibited for 
the entire area while the signs are posted.
    (d) Oral warnings. The agricultural employer shall provide oral 
warnings to workers in a manner that the worker can understand. If a 
worker will be on the premises during the application, the warning shall 
be given before the application takes place. Otherwise, the warning 
shall be given at the beginning of the worker's first work period during 
which the application is taking place or the restricted-entry interval 
for the pesticide is in effect. The warning shall consist of:
    (1) The location and description of the treated area.
    (2) The time during which entry is restricted.
    (3) Instructions not to enter the treated area until the restricted-
entry interval has expired.

Sec. 170.124  Notice of applications to handler employers.

    Whenever handlers who are employed by a commercial pesticide 
handling establishment will be performing pesticide handling tasks on an 
agricultural establishment, the agricultural employer shall provide to 
the handler employer, or assure that the handler employer is aware of, 
the following information concerning any areas on the agricultural 
establishment that the handler may be in (or may walk within 1/4 mile 
of) and that may be treated with a pesticide or that may be under a 
restricted-entry interval while the handler will be on the agricultural 
establishment:
    (a) Specific location and description of any such areas; and
    (b) Restrictions on entering those areas.


<R05>
Sec. 170.130  Pesticide safety training for workers.

    (a) General requirement--(1) Agricultural employer assurance. The 
agricultural employer shall assure that each worker, required by this 
section to be trained, has been trained according to this section during

<R05>
Sec. 170.150  Decontamination.

    (a)(1) Requirement. The agricultural employer must provide 
decontamination supplies for workers in accordance with this section 
whenever:
    (i) Any worker on the agricultural establishment is performing an 
activity in the area where a pesticide was applied or a restricted-entry 
interval (REI) was in effect within the last 30 days, and;
    (ii) The worker contacts anything that has been treated with the 
pesticide, including, but not limited to soil, water, plants, plant 
surfaces, and plant parts.
    (2) Exception. The 30-day time period established in paragraph 
(a)(1)(i) of this section shall not apply if the only pesticides used in 
the treated area are products with an REI of 4 hours or less on the 
label (but not a product without an REI on the label). When workers are 
in such treated areas, the agricultural employer shall provide 
decontamination supplies for not less than 7 days

[[Page 329]]

following the expiration of any applicable REI.
    (b) General conditions. (1) The agricultural employer shall provide 
workers with enough water for routine washing and emergency eyeflushing. 
At all times when the water is available to workers, the employer shall 
assure that it is of a quality and temperature that will not cause 
illness or injury when it contacts the skin or eyes or if it is 
swallowed.
    (2) When water stored in a tank is to be used for mixing pesticides, 
it shall not be used for decontamination or eyeflushing, unless the tank 
is equipped with properly functioning valves or other mechanisms that 
prevent movement of pesticides into the tank.
    (3) The agricultural employer shall provide soap and single-use 
towels in quantities sufficient to meet worker's needs.
    (4) To provide for emergency eyeflushing, the agricultural employer 
shall assure that at least 1 pint of water is immediately available to 
each worker who is performing early-entry activities permitted by Sec. 
170.112 and for which the pesticide labeling requires protective 
eyewear. The eyeflush water shall be carried by the early-entry worker, 
or shall be on the vehicle the early-entry worker is using, or shall be 
otherwise immediately accessible.
    (c) Location. (1) The decontamination supplies shall be located 
together and be reasonably accessible to and not more than 1/4 mile from 
where workers are working.
    (2) For worker activities performed more than 1/4 mile from the 
nearest place of vehicular access:
    (i) The soap, single-use towels, and water may be at the nearest 
place of vehicular access.
    (ii) The agricultural employer may permit workers to use clean water 
from springs, streams, lakes, or other sources for decontamination at 
the remote work site, if such water is more accessible than the water 
located at the nearest place of vehicular access.
    (3) The decontamination supplies shall not be maintained in an area 
being treated with pesticides.
    (4) The decontamination supplies shall not be maintained in an area 
that is under a restricted-entry interval, unless the workers for whom 
the supplies are provided are performing early-entry activities 
permitted by Sec. 170.112 and involving contact with treated surfaces 
and the decontamination supplies would otherwise not be reasonably 
accessible to those workers.
    (d) Decontamination after early-entry activities. At the end of any 
exposure period for workers engaged in early-entry activities permitted 
by Sec. 170.112 and involving contact with anything that has been

additional major categories.


<R05>
Sec. 171.4  Standards for certification of commercial applicators.

    (a) Determination of competency. Competence in the use and handling 
of pesticides shall be determined on the basis of written examinations, 
and, as appropriate, performance testing, based upon standards set forth 
below and which are approved by the Administrator. Such examination and 
testing shall include the general standards applicable to all categories 
(Sec. 171.4(b)) and the additional standards specifically identified 
for each category or subcategory (if any) in which an applicator is to 
be classified (Sec. 171.4(c)). State standards must conform and be at 
least equal to those prescribed herein. In developing the details of 
standards at the State level and in structuring examinations, it is 
important to recognize and reflect the extent of competency appropriate 
and necessary to a particular category.
    (b) General standards for all categories of certified commercial 
applicators. (1) All commercial applicators shall demonstrate practical 
knowledge of the principles and practices of pest control and safe use 
of pesticides. Testing shall be based on examples of problems and 
situations appropriate to the particular category or subcategory of the 
applicator's certification and the following areas of competency:
    (i) Label & labeling comprehension. (a) The general format and 
terminology of pesticide labels and labeling;
    (b) The understanding of instructions, warnings, terms, symbols, and 
other information commonly appearing on pesticide labels;
    (c) Classification of the product, general or restricted; and
    (d) Necessity for use consistent with the label.
    (ii) Safety. Factors including:
    (a) Pesticide toxicity and hazard to man and common exposure routes;
    (b) Common types and causes of pesticide accidents;
    (c) Precautions necessary to guard against injury to applicators and 
other individuals in or near treated areas;
    (d) Need for and use of protective clothing and equipment;
    (e) Symptoms of pesticide poisoning;
    (f) First aid and other procedures to be followed in case of a 
pesticide accident; and
    (g) Proper identification, storage, transport, handling, mixing 
procedures and disposal methods for pesticides and used pesticide 
containers, including precautions to be taken to prevent children from 
having access to pesticides and pesticide containers.
    (iii) Environment. The potential environmental consequences of the 
use and misuse of pesticides as may be influenced by such factors as:
    (a) Weather and other climatic conditions;
    (b) Types of terrain, soil or other substrate;

[[Page 343]]

    (c) Presence of fish, wildlife and other non-target organisms; and
    (d) Drainage patterns.
    (iv) Pests. Factors such as: (a) Common features of pest organisms 
and characteristics of damage needed for pest recognition;
    (b) Recognition of relevant pests; and
    (c) Pest development and biology as it may be relevant to problem 
identification and control.
    (v) Pesticides. Factors such as:
    (a) Types of pesticides;
    (b) Types of formulations;
    (c) Compatibility, synergism, persistence and animal and plant 
toxicity of the formulations;
    (d) Hazards and residues associated with use;
    (e) Factors which influence effectiveness or lead to such problems 
as resistance to pesticides; and
    (f) Dilution procedures.
    (vi) Equipment. Factors including: (a) Types of equipment and 
advantages and limitations of each type; and
    (b) Uses, maintenance and calibration.
    (vii) Application techniques. Factors including:
    (a) Methods of procedure used to apply various formulations of 
pesticides, solutions, and gases, together with a knowledge of which 
technique of application to use in a given situation;
    (b) Relationship of discharge and placement of pesticides to proper 
use, unnecessary use, and misuse; and
    (c) Prevention of drift and pesticide loss into the environment.
    (viii) Laws and regulations. Applicable State and Federal laws and 
regulations.
    (c) Specific standards of competency for each category of commercial 
applicators. Some of the factors referenced in paragraph (b) of this 
section are of particular importance because of the different types of 
activities carried out by applicators in each category. Such factors 
must be especially stressed and specifically reflected in State 
certification standards, as appropriate. For example, practical 
knowledge of drift problems should be required of agricultural 
applicators but not of seed treatment applicators. The latter, however, 
should be particularly knowledgeable of the hazards of the misuse of 
treated seed and the necessary precautionary techniques. Many 
applicators in Sec. 171.3(b) (8), (9), and (10) will have had 
considerable formal education, training and experience in preparation 
for their positions. Their competency with respect to the use and 
handling of pesticides will have been determined by examining boards of 
their professional scientific societies utilizing standards which equal 
or exceed those prescribed herein. Such standards should be consulted by 
States in developing their State standards for certification of such 
applicators under these regulations. Commercial applicators in each 
category shall be particularly qualified with respect to the practical 
knowledge standards elaborated below:
    (1) Agricultural pest control--(i) Plant. Applicators must 
demonstrate practical knowledge of crops grown and the specific pests of 
those crops on which they may be using restricted use pesticides. The 
importance of such competency is amplified by the extensive areas 
involved, the quantities of pesticides needed, and the ultimate use of 
many commodities as food and feed. Practical knowledge is required 
concerning soil and water problems, pre-harvest intervals, re-entry 
intervals, phytotoxicity, and potential for environmental contamination, 
non-target injury and community problems resulting from the use of 
restricted use pesticides in agricultural areas.
    (ii) Animal. Applicators applying pesticides directly to animals 
must demonstrate practical knowledge of such animals and their 
associated pests. A practical knowledge is also required concerning 
specific pesticide toxicity and residue potential, since host animals 
will frequently be used for food. Further, the applicator must know the 
relative hazards associated with such factors as formulation, 
application techniques, age of animals, stress and extent of treatment.
    (2) Forest pest control. Applicators shall demonstrate practical 
knowledge of types of forests, forest nurseries, and seed production in 
their State and the pests involved. They should possess practical 
knowledge of the cyclic occurrence of certain pests and specific 
population dynamics as a basis for programming pesticide applications. A

[[Page 344]]

practical knowledge is required of the relative biotic agents and their 
vulnerability to the pesticides to be applied. Because forest stands may 
be large and frequently include natural aquatic habitats and harbor 
wildlife, the consequences of pesticide use may be difficult to assess. 
The applicator must therefore demonstrate practical knowledge of control 
methods which will minimize the possibility of secondary problems such 
is unintended effects on wildlife. Proper use of specialized equipment 
must be demonstrated, especially as it may relate to meteorological 
factors and adjacent land use.
    (3) Ornamental and turf pest control. Applicators shall demonstrate 
practical knowledge of pesticide problems associated with the production 
and maintenance of ornamental trees, shrubs, plantings, and turf, 
including cognizance of potential phytotoxicity due to a wide variety of 
plant material, drift, and persistence beyond the intended period of 
pest control. Because of the frequent proximity of human habitations to 
application activities, applicators in this category must demonstrate 
practical knowledge of application methods which will minimize or 
prevent hazards to humans, pets, and other domestic animals.
    (4) Seed-treatment. Applicators shall demonstrate practical 
knowledge of types of seeds that require chemical protection against 
pests and factors such as seed coloration, carriers, and surface active 
agents which influence pesticide binding and may affect germination. 
They must demonstrate practical knowledge of hazards associated with 
handling, sorting and mixing, and misuse of treated seed such as 
introduction of treated seed into food and feed channels, as well as 
proper disposal of unused treated seeds.
    (5) Aquatic pest control. Applicators shall demonstrate practical 
knowledge of the secondary effects which can be caused by improper 
application rates, incorrect formulations, and faulty application of 
restricted use pesticides used in this category. They shall demonstrate 
practical knowledge of various water use situations and the potential of 
downstream effects. Further, they must have practical knowledge 
concerning potential pesticide effects on plants, fish, birds, 
beneficial insects and other organisms which may be present in aquatic 
environments. These applicators shall demonstrate practical knowledge of 
the principles of limited area application.
    (6) Right-of-way pest control. Applicators shall demonstrate 
practical knowledge of a wide variety of environments, since rights-of-
way can traverse many different terrains, including waterways. They 
shall demonstrate practical knowledge of problems on runoff, drift, and 
excessive foliage destruction and ability to recognize target organisms. 
They shall also demonstrate practical knowledge of the nature of 
herbicides and the need for containment of these pesticides within the 
right-of-way area, and the impact of their application activities in the 
adjacent areas and communities.
    (7) Industrial, institutional, structural and health related pest 
control. Applicators must demonstrate a practical knowledge of a wide 
variety of pests, including their life cycles, types of formulations 
appropriate for their control, and methods of application that avoid 
contamination of food, damage and contamination of habitat, and exposure 
of people and pets. Since human exposure, including babies, children, 
pregnant women, and elderly people, is frequently a potential problem, 
applicators must demonstrate practical knowledge of the specific factors 
which may lead to a hazardous condition, including continuous exposure 
in the various situations encountered in this category. Because health 
related pest control may involve outdoor applications, applicators must 
also demonstrate practical knowledge of environmental conditions, 
particularly related to this activity.
    (8) Public health pest control. Applicators shall demonstrate 
practical knowledge of vector-disease transmission as it relates to and 
influences application programs. A wide variety of pests is involved, 
and it is essential that they be known and recognized, and appropriate 
life cycles and habitats be understood as a basis for control strategy. 
These applicators shall have practical knowledge of a great variety of 
environments ranging from streams to those conditions found in 
buildings.

[[Page 345]]

They should also have practical knowledge of the importance and 
employment of such non-chemical control methods as sanitation, waste 
disposal, and drainage.
    (9) Regulatory pest control. Applicators shall demonstrate practical 
knowledge of regulated pests, applicable laws relating to quarantine and 
other regulation of pests, and the potential impact on the environment 
of restricted use pesticides used in suppression and eradication 
programs. They shall demonstrate knowledge of factors influencing 
introduction, spread, and population dynamics of relevant pests. Their 
knowledge shall extend beyond that required by their immediate duties, 
since their services are frequently required in other areas of the 
country where emergency measures are invoked to control regulated pests 
and where individual judgments must be made in new situations.
    (10) Demonstration and research pest control. Persons demonstrating 
the safe and effective use of pesticides to other applicators and the 
public will be expected to meet comprehensive standards reflecting a 
broad spectrum of pesticide uses. Many different pest problems 
situations will be encountered in the course of activities associated 
with demonstration, and practical knowledge of problems, pests, and 
population levels occurring in each demonstration situation is required. 
Further, they should demonstrate an understanding of a pesticide-
organism interactions and the importance of integrating pesticide use 
with other control methods. In general, it would be expected that 
applicators doing demonstration pest control work possess a practical 
knowledge of all of the standards detailed in Sec. 171.4(b). In 
addition, they shall meet the specific standards required for paragraphs 
(c) (1) through (7) of this section as may be applicable to their 
particular activity.

Persons conducting field research or method improvement work with 
restricted use pesticides should be expected to know the general 
standards detailed in 171.4(b). In addition, they shall be expected to 
know the specific standards required for paragraphs (c) (1) through (9) 
of this section, applicable to their particular activity, or 
alternatively, to meet the more inclusive requirements listed under 
``Demonstration.''
    (d) Special standards. This space reserved for possible issuance of 
Special Standards.
    (e) The above standards do not apply to the following persons for 
purposes of these regulations. (1) Persons conducting laboratory type 
research involving restricted use pesticides; and
    (2) Doctors of Medicine and Doctors of Veterinary Medicine applying 
pesticides as drugs or medication during the course of their normal 
practice.


<R05>
Sec. 171.5  Standards for certification of private applicators.

    (a) Competence in the use and handling of pesticides by a private 
applicator will be determined by procedures set forth below. State 
standards must conform and be at least equal to those prescribed herein. 
As a minimum requirement for certification, a private applicator must 
show that he possesses a practical knowledge of the pest problems and 
pest control practices associated with his agricultural operations; 
proper storage, use, handling and disposal of the pesticides and 
containers; and his related legal responsibility. This practical 
knowledge includes ability to:
    (1) Recognize common pests to be controlled and damage caused by 
them.
    (2) Read and understand the label and labeling information--
including the common name of pesticides he applied; pest(s) to be 
controlled, timing and methods of application; safety precautions; any 
pre-harvest or re-entry restrictions; and any specific disposal 
procedures.
    (3) Apply pesticides in accordance with label instructions and 
warnings, including the ability to prepare the proper concentration of 
pesticide to be used under particular circumstances taking into account 
such factors as area to be covered, speed at which application equipment 
will be driven, and the quantity dispersed in a given period of 
operation.
    (4) Recognize local environmental situations that must be considered 
during application to avoid contamination.

[[Page 346]]

    (5) Recognize poisoning symptoms and procedures to follow in case of 
a pesticide accident.
    (b) Such competence of each private applicator shall be verified by 
the responsible State agency through the administration of a private 
applicator certification system which ensures that the private 
applicator is competent, based upon the standards set forth above, to 
use the restricted use pesticides under limitations of applicable State 
and Federal laws and regulations. A certification system shall employ a 
written or oral testing procedure, or such other equivalent system as 
may be approved as part of a State plan.
    (1) In any case where a person, at the time of testing for 
certification, is unable to read a label, the responsible State agency 
may employ a testing procedure, previously approved by the 
Administrator, which can adequately assess the competence of such person 
with regard to all of the above standards. Certification must be related 
and limited to the use and handling of each individual pesticide for 
which he desires certification at any time. Therefore, the applicator 
will be authorized to use only the pesticide(s) for which he has 
demonstrated competence. A specific procedure is required for Sec. 
171.5(a)(2) relating to label comprehension, with testing designed to 
assure his knowledge of the following:
    (i) Understanding of the label and labeling information including 
those items indicated in that subsection.
    (ii) Sources of advice and guidance necessary for the safe and 
proper use of each pesticide related to his certification.
    (2) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 171.6  Standards for supervision of noncertified applicators by 

certified private and commercial applicators.

    (a) Certified applicators whose activities indicate a supervisory 
role must demonstrate a practical knowledge of Federal and State 
supervisory requirements, including labeling, regarding the application 
of restricted use pesticides by noncertified applicators.

The availability of the certified applicator must be directly related to 
the hazard of the situation. In many situations, where the certified 
applicator is not required to be physically present, ``direct 
supervision'' shall include verifiable instruction to the competent 
person, as follows: (1) Detailed guidance for applying the pesticide 
properly, and (2) provisions for contacting the certified applicator in 
the event he is needed. In other situations, and as required by the 
label, the actual physical presence of a certified applicator may be 
required when application is made by a noncertified applicator.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 171.7  Submission and approval of State plans for certification of

commercial and private applicators of restricted use pesticides.

    If any State, at any time, desires to certify applicators of 
restricted use pesticides, the Governor of that State shall submit a 
State plan for that purpose. The Administrator shall approve the plan 
submitted by any State, or any modification thereof, if the plan in his 
judgment--
    (a) Designates a State agency as the agency responsible for 
administering the plan throughout the State. Since several other 
agencies or organizations may also be involved in administering portions 
of the State plan, all of these shall be identified in the State plan, 
particularly any other agencies or organizations responsible for 
certifying applicators and suspending or revoking certification. In the 
extent that more than one governmental agency will be responsible for 
performing certain functions under the State plans, the plans shall 
identify which functions are to be performed by which agency and 
indicate how the program will be coordinated by the lead agency to 
ensure consistency of programs within the State. The lead agency will 
serve as the central contact point for the Environmental Protection 
Agency in carrying out the certification program. The numbers and job 
titles of the responsible officials of the lead agency and cooperating 
units shall be included.
    (b) Contains satisfactory assurances that such lead agency has or 
will have the legal authority and qualified personnel necessary to carry 
out the plan:

[[Page 347]]

    (1) Satisfactory assurances that the lead agency or other 
cooperating agencies have the legal authority necessary to carry out the 
plans should be in the form of an opinion of the Attorney General or the 
legal counsel of the lead agency. In addition:
    (i) The lead agency should submit a copy of each appropriate State 
law and regulation.
    (ii) In those States where any requisite legal authorities are 
pending enactment and/or promulgation, the Governor (or Chief Executive) 
may request that a State plan be approved contingent upon the enactment 
and/or promulgation of such authorities. Plans approved on a contingency 
basis will be subject to such reasonable terms and conditions, 
concerning the duration of the contingency approval and other matters, 
as the Administrator may impose. During the period of the contingency 
approval, the State will have an approved certification program and may 
proceed to certify applicators, who will then be permitted to use or 
supervise the use of pesticides classified for restricted use under 
FIFRA, as amended.
    (iii) The State plan should indicate by citations to specific laws 
(whether enacted or pending enactment) and/or regulations (whether 
promulgated or pending promulgation) that the State has legal 
authorities as follows:
    (A) Provisions for and listing of the acts which constitute grounds 
for denying, suspending, and revoking certification of applicators, and 
for assessing criminal and/or civil penalties. Such grounds should 
include, at a minimum, misuse of a pesticide and falsification of any 
records required to be maintained by the certified applicator.
    (B) Provisions for reviewing an applicator's certification to 
determine whether suspension or revocation of the certification is 
appropriate in the event of criminal conviction under section 14(b) of 
the amended FIFRA, a final order imposing civil penalty under section 
14(a) of the amended FIFRA, or conclusion of a State enforcement action.
    (C) Provisions for right-of-entry by consent or warrant by 
appropriate State officials at reasonable times for sampling, 
inspection, and observation purposes.
    (D) Provisions making it unlawful for persons other than certified 
applicators or persons working under their direct supervision to use 
restricted use pesticides.
    (E) Provisions requiring certified commercial applicators to keep 
and maintain for the period of at least two years routine operational 
records containing information on kinds, amounts, uses, dates, and 
places of application of restricted use pesticides; and for ensuring 
that such records will be available to appropriate State officials.
    (2) Satisfactory assurances that the lead agency and any cooperating 
organizations have qualified personnel necessary to carry out the plan 
will be demonstrated by including the numbers, job titles and job 
functions of persons so employed.
    (c) Gives satisfactory assurances that the State will devote 
adequate funds to the administration of the plan.
    (d) Provides that the State agency will make reports to the 
Administrator in a manner and containing information that the 
Administrator may from time to time require, including:
    (1) An annual report to be submitted by the lead agency, at a time 
to be specified by the State, to include the following information:
    (i) Total number of applicators, private and commercial, by 
category, currently certified; and number of applicators, private and 
commercial, by category, certified during the last reporting period.
    (ii) Any changes in commercial applicator subcategories.
    (iii) A summary of enforcement activities related to use of 
restricted use pesticides during the last reporting period.
    (iv) Any significant proposed changes in required standards of 
competency.
    (v) Proposed changes in plans and procedures for enforcement 
activities related to use of restricted use pesticides for the next 
reporting period.
    (vi) Any other proposed changes from the State plan that would 
significantly affect the State certification program.

[[Page 348]]

    (2) Other reports as may be required by the Administrator shall be 
submitted from time to time to meet specific needs.
    (e) Contains satisfactory assurances that the State standards for 
the certification of applicators of pesticides conform to those 
standards prescribed by the Administrator under Sec. Sec. 171.1 through 
171.6. Such assurances should consist of:
    (1) A detailed description of the State's plan for certifying 
applicators and a discussion of any special situations, problems, and 
needs together with an explanation of how the State intends to handle 
them. The State plan should include the following elements as a minimum:
    (i) For commercial applicators:
    (A) A list and description of categories and subcategories to be 
used in the State, such categories to be consistent with those defined 
in Sec. 171.3.
    (B) An estimate of the number of commercial applicators by category 
expected to be certified by the State.
    (C) The standards of competency elaborated by the State. These shall 
conform and be at least equal to those prescribed in Sec. 171.4 for the 
various categories of applicators utilized by the State. The standards 
shall also cover each of the points listed in the general standards in 
Sec. 171.4(b) and the points covered in the appropriate specific 
standards set forth in Sec. 171.4(c).
    (D) For each category and subcategory listed under Sec. 
171.7(e)(1)(i)(A), either submission of examinations or a description of 
the types and contents of examinations (e.g., multiple choice, true-
false) and submission of sample examination questions; and a description 
of any performance testing used to determine competency of applicators.
    (ii) For private applicators:
    (A) An estimate of the number of private applicators expected to be 
certified by the State.
    (B) The standards of competency elaborated by the State. These shall 
conform and be at least equal to those prescribed in Sec. 171.5(a), 
including the five requirements listed in Sec. 171.5(a) (1) through 
(5).
    (C) Types and contents of examinations and/or submission of detailed 
description of methods other than examination used to determine 
competency of private applicators.
    (D) A description of any special procedure of testing that a State 
develops to determine the competency of a private applicator who is 
unable to read the label as prescribed in Sec. 171.5(b)(1).
    (2) A provision for issuance by the State of appropriate credentials 
or documents verifying certification of applicators.
    (3) If appropriate, a description of any existing State licensing, 
certification or authorization programs for private applicators or for 
one or more categories of commercial applicators may be included. If 
these programs are determined by EPA to meet standards of competency 
prescribed by Sec. Sec. 171.1 through 171.6, States may certify 
applicators so licensed, certified or authorized without any additional 
demonstration of competency provided:
    (i) The commercial applicators who were licensed, certified, or 
authorized have demonstrated their competency based on written 
examinations and, as appropriate, performance testing, conforming to the 
standards set forth in Sec. 171.4, and
    (ii) The private applicators who were licensed, certified, or 
authorized have demonstrated their competency by written or oral testing 
procedures or other acceptable equivalent system, conforming to the 
standards set forth in Sec. 171.5.
    (4) A statement that the State accepts Federal employees qualified 
under the Government Agency Plan (GAP) as fully meeting the requirements 
for certification by that State; or a description of any additional 
requirements these employees must meet to apply restricted use 
pesticides in that State. Any such additional requirements shall be 
consistent with and shall not exceed standards established for other 
comparable applicators in that State.
    (i) Until such time as the GAP has been fully developed and approved 
by EPA, this statement (Sec. 171.7(e)(4)) is not required. However, 
within 60 days after final approval of the GAP, the State should forward 
such a statement for inclusion in its State plan.
    (5) A description of any cooperative agreements a State has made 
with any

[[Page 349]]

Indian Governing Body to certify or assist in the certification of 
applicators not subject to State jurisdiction. (Sec. 171.10).
    (6) A description of any arrangements that a State has made or plans 
to make relating to reciprocity with other States or jurisdictions for 
the acceptance of certified applicators from those States or 
jurisdictions. However, those arrangements should meet these conditions:
    (i) The State according reciprocity should provide for issuance of 
an appropriate document verifying certification based upon the 
certifying document issued by the other States or jurisdictions.
    (ii) The State according reciprocity should have enforcement 
procedures that cover out-of-State applicators determined to be 
competent and certified within the State or jurisdiction.
    (iii) The detailed State or jurisdiction standards of competency, 
for each category identified in the reciprocity arrangement should be 
sufficiently comparable to justify waiving an additional determination 
of competency by the State granting reciprocity.
    (f) In responding to the preceding requirements, a State may 
describe in its State plan other regulatory activities implemented under 
State laws or regulations which will contribute to the desired control 
of the use of restricted use pesticides by certified applicators. Such 
other regulatory activities, if described, will be considered by the 
Administrator in evaluating whether or not a State's certified 
applicator program satisfies the requirements of Sec. 171.7 (a) through 
(e).

Sec. 171.8  Maintenance of State plans.

    (a) Any State certification program approved under Sec. 171.7 shall 
be maintained in accordance with the State plan approved under that 
section. Accordingly, the State plan should include:
    (1) Provisions to assure that certified applicators comply with 
standards for the use of restricted use pesticides and carry out their 
responsibility to provide adequate supervision of noncertified 
applicators.
    (2) Provisions to ensure that certified applicators continue to meet 
the requirements of changing technology and to assure a continuing level 
of competency and ability to use pesticides safely and properly.
    (b) An approved State plan and the certification program carried out 
under such plan may not be substantially modified without the prior 
approval of the Administrator. A proposed change may be submitted for 
approval at any time but all applicable requirements prescribed by these 
Regulations must be satisfied for the modification to be eligible for 
approval by the Administrator.
    (c) Whenever the Administrator determines that a State is not 
administering the certification program in accordance with the State 
plan approved under Sec. 171.7, he shall so notify the State and 
provide for a hearing at the request of the State and, if appropriate 
corrective action is not taken within a reasonable time, not to exceed 
ninety days, the Administrator shall withdraw approval of the plan.

Sec. 171.9  Submission and approval of Government Agency Plan.

    This section is included to provide for certain Federal employees 
including those whose duties may require them to use or supervise the 
use of restricted use pesticides in a number of States.
    (a) Sections 171.1 through 171.8 will, with the necessary changes, 
apply to the Government Agency Plan (GAP) for determining and attesting 
to the competency of Federal employees to use or supervise the use of 
restricted use pesticides.
    (b) Federal employees qualified under the GAP shall:
    (1) Be prepared to present the Federal form issued to them attesting 
to their competency to appropriate State officials.
    (2) Fulfill any additional requirements States may have enumerated 
in their State plans as provided for under Sec. 171.7(e)(4).
    (c) The employing Federal agency shall ensure that certified

Sec. 171.10  Certification of applicators on Indian Reservations.

    This section applies to applicators on Indian Reservations.
    (a) On Indian Reservations \1\ not subject to State jurisdiction the 
appropriate Indian Governing Body \2\ may choose to utilize the State 
certification program, with the concurrence of the State, or develop its 
own plan for certifying private and commercial applicators to use or 
supervise the use of restricted use pesticides.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The term Indian Reservation means any federally-recognized 
reservation established by Treaty, Agreement, Executive Order, or Act of 
Congress.
    \2\ The term Indian Governing Body means the governing body of any 
tribe, band, or group of Indians subject to the jurisdiction of the 
United States and recognized by the United States as possessing power of 
self-government.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) If the Indian Governing Body decides to utilize the State 
certification program, it should enter into a cooperative agreement with 
the State. This agreement should include matters concerning funding and 
proper authority for enforcement purposes. Such agreement and any 
amendments thereto shall be incorporated in the State plan, and 
forwarded to the Administrator for approval or disapproval.
    (2) If the Indian Governing Body decides to develop its own 
certification plan, it shall be based on either Federal standards 
(Sec. Sec. 171.1 through 171.8) or State standards for certification 
which have been accepted by EPA. Such a plan shall be submitted through 
the United States Department of the Interior to the EPA Administrator 
for approval.
    (b) On Indian Reservations where the State has assumed jurisdiction 
under other Federal laws, anyone using or supervising the use of 
restricted use pesticides shall be certified under the appropriate State 
certification plan.
    (c) Non-Indians applying restricted use pesticides on Indian 
Reservations not subject to State jurisdiction shall be certified either 
under a State certification plan accepted by the Indian Governing Body 
or under the Indian Reservation certification plan.
    (d) Nothing in this section is intended either to confer or deny 
jurisdiction to the States over Indian Reservations not already 
conferred or denied under other laws or treaties.

<R05>
Sec. 171.11  Federal certification of pesticide applicators in States or on

Indian Reservations where there is no approved State or Tribal certification plan 
          in effect.

    (a) Applicability. This section applies to persons in any State and 
on any Indian Reservation where, because there is no approved State or 
Tribal certification plan in effect, the Administrator implements an EPA 
plan for the Federal certification of applicators of restricted use 
pesticides.
    (b) Certification requirement. In any State or on any Indian 
Reservation where this section is applicable, any person who uses or 
supervises the use of any pesticide classified for restricted use must 
be certified in accordance with this section. However, a competent 
person who is not certified may use a restricted use pesticide under the 
direct supervision of a certified applicator for uses authorized by the 
certified applicator's certification. Private applicator certification 
shall authorize only those uses, or the supervision of those uses, 
described in Sec. 171.2(t). Commercial applicator certification shall 
authorize only those uses, or the supervision of those uses, included 
within the specific category(ies) or subcategory(ies), described in 
Sec. 171.3(b) or an applicable Federal plan, in which the applicator is 
certified.
    (c) Certification of commercial applicators--(1) Categories for 
commercial applicators. Categories referred to in this section are the 
same as those listed in Sec. 171.3(b). Determination of competency in 
each category shall conform to the requirements of Sec. 171.4(a).
    (2) Subcategories. The Administrator may adopt subcategories as he 
or she deems necessary, consonant with the needs of the individual State 
or Reservation.

[[Page 351]]

    (3) Standards for certification. The standards of competency for 
certification of commercial applicators under this section are the same 
as those listed in Sec. 171.4 (b) and (c) and Sec. 171.6.
    (4) Certification procedure. An individual who desires to be 
certified or recertified under this paragraph shall complete the EPA 
certification form and submit the form to the appropriate EPA Regional 
Office. In order to be initially certified as a commercial applicator 
under this paragraph, an individual must take and pass written 
examinations approved by the Administrator and administered by the 
Administrator or any other party approved by him or her. A general 
examination will be given, based on the general standards found in Sec. 
171.4(b) and the standards for supervision found in Sec. 171.6. In 
addition, specific category and subcategory examinations will be given, 
based on the appropriate category or subcategory standards found in 
Sec. 171.4(c) and the applicable Federal plan. The Administrator will 
notify the individual in writing of the results of the examinations 
within 45 days unless special circumstances justify a longer time 
period. The Administrator will issue to each person who has passed a 
general examination and one or more category or subcategory examinations 
a commercial applicator certificate covering each category and 
subcategory in which he or she has qualified. A commercial applicator 
certificate is valid for a period of three years from the date of 
issuance, unless earlier suspended or revoked by the Administrator (two 
years from the date of issuance, in the case of certificates issued 
prior to [effective date of amended rule]), and is valid within the 
State or Indian Reservation named on the certificate.
    (5) Re-examination. Individuals failing to pass the required 
certification examination(s) may be re-examined after notification of 
failure. An individual seeking re-examination need take only the 
examination(s) which he or she originally failed.
    (6) Renewal of commercial applicator certification. A certified 
commercial applicator may qualify for recertification by taking and 
passing written examinations as specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section, or by successfully completing any available training program 
approved for this purpose by the Administrator. Recertification 
procedures must be completed by the certified commercial applicator 
during the twelve month period preceding the expiration date of his or 
her certificate.
    (7) Recordkeeping requirements. (i) Each self-employed certified 
commercial applicator, each firm employing a certified commercial 
applicator, and each person who contracts with a certified commercial 
applicator (or his or her employer) to have a restricted use pesticide 
applied on property owned or operated by another person shall keep and 
maintain at their principal place of business true and accurate records 
of the use of restricted use pesticides, providing the following 
information:
    (A) Name and address of the person for whom the pesticide was 
applied;
    (B) Location of the pesticide application;
    (C) Target pest(s);
    (D) Specific crop or commodity, as appropriate, and site, to which 
the pesticide was applied;
    (E) Year, month, day, and time of application;
    (F) Trade name and EPA registration number of the pesticide applied;
    (G) Amount of the pesticide applied and percentage of active 
ingredient per unit of the pesticide used; and
    (H) Type and amount of the pesticide disposed of, method of 
disposal, date(s) of disposal, and location of the disposal site.
    (ii) Availability of required records. Each certified commercial 
applicator shall keep all records required under this paragraph current 
and shall make such records available for inspection and copying by 
representatives of EPA for a period of at least two years from the date 
of use of the pesticide.
    (d) Certification of private applicators--(1) Certification 
procedures. An individual who desires to be certified or recertified 
under this paragraph shall complete the EPA certification form and 
submit the form to the appropriate EPA Regional Office. In order to be 
certified or recertified as a private applicator to use restricted use 
pesticides, an individual must be determined competent with respect to 
the

[[Page 352]]

use and handling of pesticide. Standards for such determination are the 
same as those listed in Sec. Sec. 171.5 and 171.6. The Administrator 
will offer one or more of the following certification options, including 
at least one option which does not require the applicator to take an 
examination--
    (i) Approved training course. The individual may successfully 
complete an approved training course. Approved training courses may 
include courses sponsored by EPA, State cooperative extension services, 
State vocational agricultural courses, or private educational groups. 
Each training course for certification must be approved for that purpose 
by the Administrator and include, at a minimum, coverage of the private 
applicator standards listed in Sec. Sec. 171.5 and 171.6, and a 
demonstration that the individual has successfully completed the 
training course. Subject to the approval of the Administrator, this 
demonstration may be accomplished by completion of a no pass/no fail 
written questionnaire or a workbook, receipt of a passing grade in an 
approved course offered by an educational institution, or any other 
equivalent procedure.
    (ii) Written examination. The individual may pass a written 
examination approved by the Administrator and administered by the 
Administrator or any other party approved by him or her.
    (iii) Self-study program. The individual may successfully complete a 
self-study learning program approved by the Administrator and 
administered by the Administrator or any other party approved by him or 
her.
    (iv) Non-reader certification. Non-readers may be certified for 
specific use(s) of a single product by successfully completing an 
approved training course as specified in (d)(1) (i) of this section, or 
by passing an oral examination approved by the Administrator and 
administered by the Administrator or any other party approved by him or 
her. Such training or testing shall incorporate a specific procedure 
relating to label comprehension, as described in Sec. 171.5(b)(1).
    (2) Issuance of certificates. The Administrator will issue a private 
applicator certificate to each individual who successfully completes any 
available certification option. Individuals who, for any reason, fail to 
complete successfully a certification option may attempt to complete the 
same option or, if available, an alternative option. A private 
applicator certificate is valid for a period of four years from the date 
of issuance (three years from the date of issuance, in the case of 
certificates issued before [effective date of amended rule]), unless 
earlier suspended or revoked by the Administrator, and is valid within 
the State or Indian Reservation named on the certificate.
    (3) Renewal of private applicator certification. A certified private 
applicator may qualify for recertification by successfully completing 
any available certification option during the twelve month period 
preceding the expiration date of his or her certificate.
    (e) Recognition of other certificates. The Administrator may issue a 
certificate to an individual possessing any other valid Federal, State 
or Tribal certificate without further demonstration of competency. The 
individual shall submit the EPA certification form and written evidence 
of valid certification to the appropriate EPA Regional Office. The 
Administrator may deny issuance of such certificate if the standards of 
competency for each category or subcategory identified in the other 
Federal, State or Tribal certificate are not sufficiently comparable to 
justify waiving further demonstration of competency. The Administrator 
may revoke, suspend, or modify such certificate if the Federal, State or 
Tribal certificate upon which it is based is revoked, suspended, or 
modified. Unless suspended or revoked, a certificate issued under this 
paragraph is valid for two years for commercial applicators and three 
years for private applicators, or until the expiration date of the 
original Federal, State or Tribal certificate, whichever occurs first.
    (f) Denial, suspension, modification or revocation of a certificate. 
(1) The Administrator may suspend all or part of a certificate issued 
pursuant to this section, or, after opportunity for a hearing, may deny 
issuance of, or revoke or modify, a certificate issued pursuant to this 
section, if he or she finds that the applicant or certificate

[[Page 353]]

holder has been convicted under section 14(b) of the amended FIFRA, has 
been subject to a final order imposing a civil penalty under section 
14(a) of the amended FIFRA, or has committed any of the following acts:
    (i) Used any registered pesticide in a manner inconsistent with its 
labeling;
    (ii) Made available for use, or used, any registered pesticide 
classified for restricted use other than in accordance with section 3(d) 
of the amended FIFRA and any regulations promulgated thereunder;
    (iii) Refused to keep and maintain any records required pursuant to 
this section;
    (iv) Made false or fraudulent records, invoices or reports;
    (v) Failed to comply with any limitations or restrictions on or in a 
duly issued certificate; or,
    (vi) Violated any provision of the amended FIFRA and the regulations 
promulgated thereunder.
    (2) If the Administrator decides to deny, revoke, or modify a 
certificate, he or she will:
    (i) Notify the applicant or certificate holder of:
    (A) The ground(s) upon which the denial, revocation or modification 
is based;
    (B) The time period during which the denial, revocation or 
modification is effective, whether permanent or otherwise;
    (C) The conditions, if any, under which the individual may become 
certified or recertified; and,
    (D) Any additional conditions the Administrator may impose.
    (ii) Provide the applicant or certificate holder an opportunity to 
request a hearing prior to final Agency action to deny, revoke or modify 
the certificate.
    (3) If a hearing is requested by an applicant or certificate holder 
pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, the Administrator 
will:
    (i) Notify the affected applicant or certificate holder of those 
assertions of law and fact upon which the action to deny, revoke or 
modify the certificate is based;
    (ii) Provide the affected applicant or certificate holder an 
opportunity to offer written statements of facts, explanations, 
comments, and arguments relevant to the proposed action;
    (iii) Provide the affected applicant or certificate holder such 
other procedural opportunities as the Administrator may deem appropriate 
to ensure a fair and impartial hearing; and
    (iv) Appoint an attorney in the Agency as Presiding Officer to 
conduct the hearing. No person shall serve as Presiding Officer if he or 
she has had any prior connection with the specific case.
    (4) The Presiding Officer appointed pursuant to paragraph (f)(3)(iv) 
of this section shall:
    (i) Conduct a fair, orderly, and impartial hearing, without 
unnecessary delay;
    (ii) Consider all relevant evidence, explanation, comment, and 
argument submitted pursuant to paragraphs (f)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this 
section; and,
    (iii) Promptly notify the affected applicant or certificate holder 
of his or her decision and order. Such an order is a final Agency action 
subject to judicial review in accordance with Section 16 of the amended 
FIFRA.
    (5) If the Administrator decides to suspend all or part of a 
certificate, he or she will:
    (i) First determine that the public health, interest or welfare 
warrants immediate action to suspend the certificate;
    (ii) Notify the certificate holder of the ground(s) upon which the 
suspension action is based;
    (iii) Notify the certificate holder of the time period during which 
the suspension is effective; and,
    (iv) Notify the certificate holder of his or her intent to revoke or 
modify the certificate, as appropriate, in accord with paragraph (f)(2) 
of this section. If such revocation or modification notice has not 
previously been issued, it will be issued at the same time the 
suspension notice is issued.
    (6) In cases where the act constituting grounds for suspension, 
revocation, or modification of a certificate is neither willful nor 
contrary to the public interest, health, or safety, the affected 
certificate holder may have additional procedural rights under 5 U.S.C. 
558(c).
    (7) Any notice, decision, or order issued by the Administrator under

[[Page 354]]

paragraph (f) of this section, and any documents filed by an applicant 
or certificate holder in a hearing under paragraph (f) of this section, 
shall be available to the public except as otherwise provided by section 
10 of the amended FIFRA or by part 2 of this title. Any such hearing at 
which oral testimony is presented shall be open to the public, except 
that the Presiding Officer may exclude the public to the extent 
necessary to allow presentation of information which may be entitled to 
confidentiality under section 10 of the amended FIFRA or under part 2 of 
this title.
    (g) Pesticide dealer reporting and recordkeeping requirements, 
availability of records, and failure to comply--(1) Reporting 
requirements. Each person who is a restricted use pesticide retail 
dealer in a State or on an Indian Reservation where the Administrator 
conducts the applicator certification and training program shall:
    (i) Report to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the business 
name by which the restricted use pesticide retail dealer operates, and 
the name and business address of each of his dealerships. For dealers or 
dealerships in Nebraska this initial report must be submitted to EPA, 
Region VII, 324 E. 11th Street, Kansas City, MO 64106. For dealers or 
dealerships in Colorado this initial report must be submitted to EPA, 
Region VIII, 1860 Lincoln Street, Denver, Colorado 80295. This report 
shall be submitted to the appropriate EPA regional office no later than

pesticide retail dealer, or within 60 days after the publication of the 
effective date of this final rule, whichever date is later.
    (ii) Submit revisions to the initial report to the appropriate EPA 
regional office listed above reflecting any name changes, additions or 
deletions of dealerships. Revisions shall be submitted to EPA within 10 
days of the occurrence of such change, addition or deletion.
    (2) Recordkeeping requirement. Recordkeeping is required when making 
restricted use pesticides available to:
    (i) Certified applicators. Each restricted use pesticide retail 
dealer shall maintain at each individual dealership records of each 
transaction where a restricted use pesticide is made available for use 
by that dealership to a certified applicator. Record of each such 
transaction shall be maintained for a period of 24 months after the date 
of the transaction, and shall include the following information:
    (A) Name and address of the residence or principal place of business 
of each person to whom the pesticide was made available for use.
    (B) The certification number on the document evidencing that 
person's certification, the State (or other governmental unit) that 
issued the doucment, the expiration date of the certification, and the 
categories in which the applicator is certified, if appropriate.
    (C) The product name, EPA registration number, and the State special 
local need registration number, granted under section 24(c) of the FIFRA 
(if any) on the label of the pesticide.

can document that the restricted use pesticide will be used by a 
certified applicator, and he maintains the records required in this 
subsection. Each restricted use pesticide retail dealer shall maintain 
records at each individual dealership of each transaction where a 
restricted use pesticide was made available to an uncertified person for 
use by a certified applicator. Records of each such transaction shall be 
maintained for a period of 24 months after the date of the transaction, 
and shall include the following information:
    (A) The name and address of the residence or principal place of 
business of the uncertified person to whom the restricted use pesticide 
is made available for use by a certified applicator.
    (B) The name and address of the residence or principal place of 
business of the certified applicator who will use the restricted use 
pesticide.

[[Page 355]]

    (C) The certified applicator's certification number, the State (or 
other governmental unit) that issued his certification document, the 
expiration date of the certification, and the categories in which the 
applicator is certified, if appropriate.

local need registration number, granted under section 24(c) of the FIFRA 
(if any) on the label of the pesticide.
    (E) The quantity of the pesticide made available for use in the 
transaction.
    (F) The date of the transaction.
    (G) At the time of each transaction, EPA recommends that the dealer 
obtain the information required in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) (A) through (C) 
of this section and assure himself that the restricted use pesticide is 
made available for use by a certified applicator by examining one of the 
following sets of documents:
    (1) The original of the certified applicator's certification 
document, and a driver's license or other State, county, or Tribal 
identification document issued to the uncertified person to whom the 
restricted use pesticide is made available.
    (2) A photocopy or facsimile of the certified applicator's 
certification document, together with a statement signed by the 
certified applicator authorizing the uncertified person to purchase the 
restricted use pesticide on his behalf, and a driver's license or other 
State, county, or Tribal identification document issued to the 
uncertified person to whom the restricted use pesticide is made 
available.
    (3) A photocopy or facsimile of the certified applicator's 
certification document, together with a copy of a signed contract or 
agreement, between the uncertified person to whom the restricted use 
pesticide is being made available for use and the identified certified 
applicator, which provides for the use of the restricted use pesticide 
by the identified certified applicator, and a driver's license or other 
State, county, or Tribal identification document issued to the

[73 FR 75599, Dec. 12, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 172.2  General.

    (a) Pursuant to section 5 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and 
Rodenticide Act, as amended (86 Stat. 983), and except as herein 
provided by Sec. 172.3, any person wishing to accumulate information 
necessary to register under section 3 of the Act and the regulations 
thereunder (1) a pesticide not registered with this Agency or (2) a 
registered pesticide for a use not previously approved in the 
registration of the pesticide may apply to the Administrator at any time 
for an experimental use permit.
    (b) Pesticides under experimental use permits may not be sold or 
distributed other than through participants and, if sold or distributed 
through participants, may be used only at an application site of a 
cooperator and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
experimental use permit.


<R05>
Sec. 172.3  Scope of requirement.

    (a) An experimental use permit (EUP) is generally required for 
testing of any unregistered pesticide or any registered pesticide being 
tested for an unregistered use. However, as described in paragraph (b) 
of this section, certain of such tests are presumed not to involve 
unreasonable adverse effects and, therefore, do not require an EUP.
    (b) Except as provided in subpart C of this part or as specifically 
determined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), it may be 
presumed that EUPs are not required when:
    (1) The experimental use of the pesticide is limited to:
    (i) Laboratory or greenhouse tests,
    (ii) Limited replicated field trials as described in paragraph (c) 
of this section to confirm such tests, or
    (iii) Other tests as described in paragraph (c) of this section 
whose purpose is only to assess the pesticide's potential efficacy, 
toxicity, or other properties.
    (2) The producer, applicator, or any other person conducting the 
test does not expect to receive any benefit in pest control from the 
pesticide's use.
    (c) For purposes of paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(1)(iii) of this 
section, the following types of experimental tests are presumed not to 
need an EUP:

[[Page 357]]

    (1) A small-scale test involving use of a particular pesticide that 
is conducted on a cumulative total of no more than 10 acres of land per 
pest, except that:
    (i) When testing for more than one target pest occurs at the same 
time and in the same locality, the 10 acre limitation shall encompass 
all of the target pests.
    (ii) Any food or feed crops involved in, or affected by, such tests 
(including, but not limited to, crops subsequently grown on such land 
which may reasonably be expected to contain residues of the tested 
pesticides) shall be destroyed or consumed only by experimental animals 
unless an appropriate tolerance or exemption from a tolerance has been 
established under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) for 
residues of the pesticide.
    (2) A small-scale test involving the use of a particular pesticide 
that is conducted on a cumulative total of no more than 1 surface acre 
of water per pest, except that:
    (i) When the testing for more than one target pest occurs at the 
same time and in the same locality, the 1 acre limitation shall 
encompass all of the target pests.
    (ii) Waters which are involved in or affected by such tests are not 
used for irrigation purposes, drinking water supplies, or body contact 
recreational activities.
    (iii) Testing shall not be conducted in any waters which contain or 
affect fish, shellfish, plants, or animals taken for recreational or 
commercial purposes and used for food or feed, unless an appropriate 
tolerance or exemption from a tolerance has been established under the 
FFDCA for residues of the pesticide.
    (3) Animal treatment tests involving the use of a particular 
pesticide that are conducted only on experimental animals which will not 
be used for food or feed, unless an appropriate tolerance or an 
exemption from a tolerance has been established for animal products and 
byproducts under the FFDCA for residues of the pesticide.
    (d) The examples in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) of this 
section are not all-inclusive and do not preclude testing in larger 
areas or larger numbers of units if the intended use meets the criteria 
of paragraph (a) of this section. However, tests which do not come 
within the examples in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) of this 
section, absent a specific determination by EPA to the contrary, require 
an EUP. Persons intending to conduct tests who are uncertain whether the 
testing may be conducted without a permit may submit a request for 
determination to the Office of Pesticide Programs' Document Processing 
Desk at the appropriate address as set forth in 40 CFR 150.17(a) or (b). 
Such a request shall include the information listed in Sec. 
172.4(b)(1)(ii) and (b)(1)(iii) and in the case of an unregistered 
product, the information in Sec. 172.4(b)(3)(i).
    (e) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, EPA 
may, on a case-by-case basis, require that certain testing of a 
particular pesticide or class of pesticides be carried out under an EUP, 
if it is determined that such EPA oversight is warranted. If EPA 
determines that an EUP is required, it will notify the developer of the 
pesticide of the need for an EUP and provide opportunity for comment or 
objections before imposing the requirement.
    (f) No EUP is required for a substance or mixture of substances 
being put through tests for the sole purpose of gathering data required 
for approval of such substance or mixture under the FFDCA (21 U.S.C. 301 
et seq.) as:
    (1) A ``new drug'' (21 U.S.C. sec. 321(p) and sec. 355).
    (2) A ``new animal drug'' (21 U.S.C. sec. 321(w) and sec. 360(b)), 
or
    (3) An ``animal feed'' (21 U.S.C. sec. 321 (x)) containing a ``new 
animal drug'' (21 U.S.C. sec. 360(b)).
    (g) Paragraph (f) of this section shall not apply when a purpose of 
such test is to accumulate information necessary to register a pesticide 
under section 3 of the Act.

<R05>
Sec. 172.5  The permit.

    (a) Issuance. The Experimental Use Permit shall be issued when the 
Administrator determines that the conditions of section 5 of the Act, 
and the regulations thereunder, have been met subject to such terms and 
conditions as the Administrator determines are warranted.
    (b) Duration. Permits will be effective for a specified period of 
time, normally one year, depending upon the crop or site to be tested 
and the requirements of the testing program submitted. The applicant 
should propose a suitable duration of the permit commensurate with the 
program submitted. Permits and associated temporary tolerances may be 
renewed, extended, or amended upon request if circumstances warrant.
    (c) Limitations. The quantity of a pesticide allowed by a permit may 
be less than requested if it is determined that the available 
information on efficacy, toxicity or other hazards, the need for data, 
or the adequacy of program supervision does not justify the quantity of 
the pesticide requested. Other limitations may also be placed in the 
permit if necessary for the protection of the public health and the 
environment.
    (d) Additions. With respect to an experimental use pesticide 
containing any chemical or combination of chemicals not included in any 
previously registered pesticides, the Administrator may require that 
additional studies be conducted during the permit period to gather data 
to support the establishment of tolerances and/or registration. To the 
extent practicable, the applicant will be notified of any such 
requirements before or at the time an experimental use permit is issued.
    (e) Maintenance of records. All producers of pesticides produced 
pursuant to an experimental use permit shall maintain records in 
accordance with part 169.


<R05>
Sec. 172.6  Labeling.

    (a) Contents. Except as provided by paragraph (b) of this section,

approve the use of the experimental program as labeling provided that 
such program is to be distributed with the product.
    (b) Supplemental labeling. In the case of a registered pesticide, 
the Administrator may, at his discretion, permit a pesticide to be used 
under an experimental use permit with supplemental labeling as approved 
by him.


<R05>
Sec. 172.7  Importation of technical material.

    Technical materials may be imported without registration in 
sufficient quantities to formulate a pesticide for which an Experimental 
Use Permit has been requested if the application for such permit states 
that such importation will occur.


<R05>
Sec. 172.8  Program surveillance and reporting of data.

    (a) The permittee shall supervise the test program and evaluate the 
results of testing at each site of application. It will further be the 
responsibility of the permittee to report immediately to the 
Administrator, or to any person designated by him, any adverse effects 
from use of, or exposure to, the pesticide.

shall include:
    (i) All data gathered during the testing program; field notes need 
not be submitted but must be maintained and submitted upon request;
    (ii) A description of the disposition of any pesticide containers 
and any unused pesticides including amounts disposed of and the method 
and site of disposition; and
    (iii) The method of disposition of affected food and/or feed.

The data under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section above may be 
submitted as part of an application for registration submitted within 
180 days after the expiration of the permit, provided that the final 
report shall include a statement that such application has been made, 
and the date of such application.
    (c) In addition to the reporting requirements provided for elsewhere 
in this part, in the case of any meat-producing animals or birds that

explanations, and arguments relevant to the revocation action;
    (iii) All other procedural opportunities to which the permittee may 
be entitled by law.
    (8) The Administrator shall notify the affected permittee and State 
Agency, in writing, of his final decision on the revocation matter as 
expeditiously as possible and shall attempt to do so within 30 days 
after the conclusion of a conference conducted under paragraph (c)(7). 
The Administrator shall also provide the permittee and the State agency 
with a written statement of the reasons for his decision, which shall 
take into account the evidence presented pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(7)(ii) of this section.

Testing conducted with microbial pesticides identified in paragraph (c) 
of this section, but made exempt pursuant to Sec. 172.52, does not 
require a Notification. The following microbial pesticides (or classes 
of pesticides) are exempt from the notification requirement in paragraph 
(a) of this section:
    (i) Microbial pesticides resulting from deletions or rearrangements 
within a single genome that are brought about by the introduction of 
genetic material that has been deliberately modified.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (2) Testing conducted in a facility with adequate containment and 
inactivation controls, as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, 
does not require a Notification.
    (e) Selection and use of containment and inactivation controls. (1) 
Selection and use of containment and inactivation controls for a 
particular microbial pesticide shall take into account the following:
    (i) Factors relevant to the microbial pesticide's ability to survive 
in the environment.
    (ii) Potential routes of release in air, solids, and liquids; in or 
on waste materials and equipment; in or on people (including maintenance 
and custodial personnel); and in or on other organisms such as insects 
and rodents.
    (iii) Procedures for transfer of materials between facilities.
    (iv) Plans for routine or emergency clean-up and test termination.
    (2) For purposes of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, EPA will 
presume that compliance with the containment provisions of the National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) ``Guidelines for Research Involving 
Recombinant DNA Molecules'' (51 FR 16958, May 7, 1986) constitutes 
selection and use of adequate containment and inactivation controls.
    (3) The selection of containment and inactivation controls shall be 
approved by an authorized official of the organization that is 
conducting the test prior to commencement of the test.
    (4) Records shall be developed and maintained describing the 
selection

[[Page 368]]

and use of the containment and inactivation controls, including 
contingency plans for emergency clean-up and test termination, that will 
be used during the test. These records shall be available for inspection 
at the test facility. In addition, these records shall be submitted to 
EPA at EPA's request and within the time frame specified in EPA's 
request.
    (5) Subsequent to any EPA review of the containment/inactivation 
controls selected under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, changes to the 
controls necessary to prevent unreasonable adverse effects must be made 
upon EPA request. Failure to comply with EPA's request shall result in 
automatic revocation of the exemption from the requirement to submit a 
Notification.


<R05>
Sec. 172.46  Submission of a notification.

    (a) When to submit a Notification. A Notification shall be submitted 
for approval at least 90 days prior to the initiation of the proposed 
test.
    (b) Where to submit a notification. A notification shall be 
submitted to the Office of Pesticide Programs' Document Processing Desk 
at the appropriate address as set forth in 40 CFR 150.17(a) or (b), 
Attention: Biotechnology Notification Review.
    (c) How to format a Notification. A Notification submitted under 
this section must comply with the following procedures, but is not 
required to comply with the format and other provisions governing 
submission of data in Sec. Sec. 158.32 and 158.33 or 161.32 and 161.33 
of this chapter. However, because data submitted with the Notification 
may subsequently be used to support other regulatory actions (e.g., used 
in EUP or registration applications), it is recommended that such data 
comply with EPA requirements in Sec. Sec. 158.32 and 158.33 of this 
chapter.
    (1) Each Notification must be accompanied by a transmittal document 
that clearly identifies the EPA action supported as a Biotechnology 
Notification Review.
    (2) Five copies of each Notification must be submitted to EPA.
    (3) Any claims of confidentiality for information submitted in the 
Notification must be made as described in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) How to make confidential business information (CBI) claims in a 
Notification. Although it is strongly recommended that the submitter 
minimize the amount of data and other information claimed as CBI, a 
submitter may assert a claim of confidentiality for all or part of the 
information submitted to EPA in a Notification (See part 2, subpart B of 
this chapter). To assert such a claim, the submitter must comply with 
the following procedures:
    (1) Any claim of confidentiality must accompany the information at 
the time the information is submitted to EPA. Failure to assert a claim 
at that time will be considered a waiver of confidentiality for the 
information submitted, and the information may be made available to the 
public, subject to section 10(g) of the Act, with no further notice to 
the submitter.
    (2) Of the five copies of the Notification required by paragraph (c) 
of this section, four copies must be complete with the information that 
is claimed confidential clearly marked in the manner described in Sec. 
2.203(b) of this chapter. All information claimed as confidential must 
be deleted from the fifth copy, but it must be otherwise complete. The 
first page of the fifth copy must be marked ``Contains no information 
claimed as confidential.'' EPA may include the fifth copy in a public 
file without further notice. EPA will consider incomplete a Notification 
containing information claimed as CBI that is not submitted in 
accordance with this paragraph and will suspend the review period on the 
Notification until such procedures are followed.
    (3) Any claim of confidentiality must be accompanied, at the time 
the claim is made, by comments substantiating the claim and explaining 
why the submitter believes that the information should not be disclosed. 
The submitter should refer to Sec. 2.204(e)(4) of this chapter for 
points to address in the substantiation. If such comments are themselves 
claimed confidential and are marked confidential when submitted to EPA, 
they will be treated as such in accordance with Sec. 2.205(c) of this 
chapter. EPA will consider incomplete all Notifications containing 
information

[[Page 369]]

claimed as CBI that are not accompanied by substantiation, and will 
suspend the review period on such Notifications until the required 
substantiation is provided.
    (4) EPA will disclose information that is subject to a claim of 
confidentiality asserted under this section only to the extent and by 
means of the procedures set forth in section 10 of the Act, in this 
subpart, and in part 2 of this chapter.

Sec. 172.57  Submission of information regarding potential unreasonable adverse effects.

    Any person using a microbial pesticide in small-scale testing 
covered by this subpart who obtains information regarding potential 
unreasonable adverse effects on health or the environment must within 30 
days of receipt of such information submit the information to EPA, 
unless the person has actual knowledge that EPA has been adequately 
informed of such information. The requirement to submit information 
applies both to those microbial pesticides subject to the notification 
requirements under Sec. 172.45(c) and those that are exempt under Sec. 
172.45(d).


<R05>
Sec. 172.59  Enforcement.

    (a) Imminent threat of substantial harm to health or the 
environment. The use of a microbial pesticide in small-scale testing 
covered by this subpart (whether subject to the notification 
requirements of Sec. 172.45(c) or exempt under Sec. 172.45(d)) in a 
manner that creates an imminent threat of substantial harm to health or 
the environment is prohibited, and is considered a violation of section 
12(a)(2)(S) of the Act.
    (b) EPA response to violations. Under section 14 of the Act, EPA may 
seek civil or criminal penalties for violations of the Act. Failure to

<R05>
Sec. 173.3  Initiation of rescission proceedings.

    (a) Whenever the Administrator determines that a State having 
primary enforcement responsibility for pesticide use violations is not 
carrying out such responsibility, or cannot carry out such 
responsibility due to the lack of adequate legal authority, the 
Administrator shall notify the State in writing of his intent to rescind 
its primary enforcement responsibility, in whole or in part, by serving 
upon the State a notice of intent to rescind.
    (b) The notice of intent to rescind shall:
    (1) Specify those aspects of the State's pesticide use enforcement 
program determined to be inadequate;
    (2) Specify the facts which underlie the findings contained in the 
rescission notice;

request that an informal conference be held between appropriate State 
and EPA officials to discuss the findings made in the notice of intent 
to rescind. The informal conference shall then be held in the State. If 
the Administrator finds, on the basis of information submitted by the 
State at the conference, that the deficiencies specified in the notice 
did not exist or were corrected by the State, the Administrator shall 
issue an order withdrawing the notice of intent to rescind and 
terminating the rescission proceeding.
    (b) At any time after receipt of a notice of intent to rescind and 
before the issuance of a final order, the State and EPA may resolve the 
issues raised in the notice by agreement. Any settlement agreement shall 
be in writing and signed by the parties and shall:
    (1) Detail the deficiencies found in the State program;
    (2) Specify the steps the State has taken or will take to remedy the 
deficiencies; and
    (3) Set forth a precise schedule for each remedial action yet to be

of intent to rescind upon the State, the Administrator shall publish the 
notice of intent to rescind in the Federal Register. The Administrator 
may modify the original notice of intent to rescind before its 
publication by deleting those deficiencies listed in the original notice 
which have been corrected or which were shown not to have existed. The 
public may submit comments upon the matters specified in the published 
notice of intent to rescind within the time specified therein.
    (b) Concurrently with the publication of the notice of intent to 
rescind, the Administrator shall schedule a hearing in the State if one 
has been requested by the State. The date, time, and location of the 
hearing shall be published in the Federal Register along with the notice 
of intent to rescind.
    (c) If a hearing is requested and the Administrator has not issued 
an order terminating the rescission proceeding, the Administrator shall 
provide for a hearing as scheduled. Representatives of the State, EPA, 
and the public may present evidence at the hearing. The Administrator 
shall appoint a Presiding Officer who shall preside over the hearing and 
make a recommended decision regarding the adequacy of the State's 
pesticide use enforcement program. The Administrator, after consultation 
with the State, may prescribe additional procedures governing the 
conduct of the hearing.
    (d) If a termination order is issued or the hearing is rescheduled 
after the notice of intent to rescind is published in the Federal 
Register, such order or notice rescheduling the hearing shall also be 
published in the Federal Register.

Sec. 173.7  Hearing and recommended decision.

    (a) The Presiding Officer shall:
    (1) Conduct a fair and impartial hearing, without unnecessary delay;
    (2) Ensure that the facts are fully elicited; and
    (3) Consider all evidence, comment, and argument which is submitted 
by persons who will be affected by the outcome of the proceeding and 
which is not irrelevant, immaterial, unduly repetitious, or otherwise 
unreliable or of little probative value. The Presiding Officer may 
require any prospective witness to make available, in advance of the 
hearing, a brief summary of his or her testimony.
    (b) If, following the close of the hearing, the Presiding Officer 
finds that the State has corrected, or has agreed in writing to correct, 
the deficiencies specified in the notice of intent to rescind or has 
shown that such deficiencies do not exist, the Presiding Officer shall 
issue a decision recommending that the notice of intent to rescind be 
withdrawn and that the rescission proceeding be terminated.
    (c) If, following the close of the hearing, the Presiding Officer 
finds that the State has not corrected the deficiencies in its program, 
the Presiding Officer shall issue a decision recommending that the 
State's primary enforcement responsibility for pesticide use violations 
be rescinded in whole or in part.
    (d) The recommended decision of the Presiding Officer shall become 
final Agency action forty-five (45) days after its service upon the 
parties and without further proceedings unless (1) an appeal to the 
Administrator is taken from it by a party to the proceeding, or (2) the 
Administrator elects, sua sponte, to review the recommended decision.


<R05>
Sec. 173.8  Final order.

    (a) If the State does not request a hearing within the sixty-day 
time period and the Administrator has not issued an order withdrawing 
the notice of intent to rescind, the Administrator shall issue a final 
order as soon as

[[Page 374]]

practicable after the time for public comment on the notice of intent to 
rescind has elapsed. The final order shall either withdraw the notice of 
intent to rescind and terminate the proceeding or rescind, in whole or 
in part, the State's primary enforcement responsibility for pesticide 
use violations.
    (b) If a hearing has been held and the Presiding Officer has made a 
recommended decision, then either the Office of Enforcement or the State 
may appeal the recommended decision to the Administrator or the 
Administrator may elect to review the recommended decision on his own 
initiative.
    (c) After an appeal or sua sponte review the Administrator shall 
issue a final order terminating the rescission proceeding or rescinding, 
in whole or in part, the State's primary enforcement responsibility for 
pesticide use violations.
    (d) In no event may the Administrator issue his final decision 
sooner than ninety (90) days after service of the notice of intent to 
rescind on a State.
    (e) Any final order, or a recommended decision which becomes a final 
order under Sec. 173.7(c), shall be published in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 173.9  Judicial review.

                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 174.1  Scope and purpose.

    The characteristics of plant-incorporated protectants such as their 
production and use in plants, their biological properties, and their 
ability to spread and increase in quantity in the environment 
distinguish them from traditional chemical pesticides. Therefore, plant-
incorporated protectants are subject to some different regulatory 
requirements and procedures than traditional chemical pesticides. This 
part sets forth regulatory requirements, criteria, and procedures 
applicable to plant-incorporated protectants under FIFRA and FFDCA. When 
applied to plant-incorporated protectants, the definitions and 
regulations in this part supersede the regulations found in parts 150 
through 180 of this chapter to the extent that the regulations conflict. 
Unless otherwise superseded by this part, the regulations in parts 150 
through 180 of this chapter apply to plant-incorporated protectants.


<R05>
Sec. 174.3  Definitions.

    Terms used in this part have the same meaning as in FIFRA. In 
addition, the following terms have the meaning set forth in this 
section.
    Active ingredient means a pesticidal substance that is intended to 
be produced and used in a living plant, or in the produce thereof, and 
the genetic material necessary for the production of such a pesticidal 
substance.
    Administrator means the Administrator of the United States 
Environmental Protection Agency or his/her delegate.
    Bridging crosses between plants means the utilization of an 
intermediate plant

[[Page 376]]

in a cross to produce a viable zygote between the intermediate plant and 
a first plant, in order to cross the plant resulting from that zygote 
with a third plant that would not otherwise be able to produce viable 
zygotes from the fusion of its gametes with those of the first plant. 
The result of the bridging cross is the mixing of genetic material of 
the first and third plant through the formation of an intermediate 
zygote.
    Cell fusion means the fusion in vitro of two or more cells or 
protoplasts.
    Conventional breeding of plants means the creation of progeny 
through either: The union of gametes, i.e., syngamy, brought together 
through processes such as pollination, including bridging crosses 
between plants and wide crosses, or vegetative reproduction. It does not 
include use of any of the following technologies: Recombinant DNA; other 
techniques wherein the genetic material is extracted from an organism 
and introduced into the genome of the recipient plant through, for 
example, micro-injection, macro-injection, micro-encapsulation; or cell 
fusion.
    EPA means the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
    Exudate means a substance gradually discharged or secreted across 
intact cellular membranes or cell walls and present in the intercellular 
spaces or on the exterior surfaces of the plant.
    FFDCA means the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321 
et seq.).
    FIFRA means the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, 
as amended (7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.).
    Food includes articles used for food or drink by humans or other 
animals.
    Food plant means a plant which either in part or in toto, is used as 
food.
    Genetic material necessary for the production means both: Genetic 
material that encodes a substance or leads to the production of a 
substance; and regulatory regions. It does not include noncoding, 
nonexpressed nucleotide sequences.
    Genome means the sum of the heritable genetic material in the plant, 
including genetic material in the nucleus and organelles.
    In a living plant means inside the living plant, on the surface of 
the living plant, or as an exudate from the living plant.
    Inert ingredient, means any substance, such as a selectable marker, 
other than the active ingredient, where the substance is used to confirm 
or ensure the presence of the active ingredient, and includes the 
genetic material necessary for the production of the substance, provided 
that genetic material is intentionally introduced into a living plant in 
addition to the active ingredient.
    Living plant means a plant, plant organ, or plant part that is 
alive, viable, or dormant. Examples of plant parts include, but are not 
limited to, seeds, fruits, leaves, roots, stems, flowers, and pollen.
    Noncoding, nonexpressed nucleotide sequences means the nucleotide 
sequences are not transcribed and are not involved in gene expression.

are not limited to, linkers, adapters, homopolymers, and sequences of 
restriction enzyme recognition sites.
    Nucleic acids means ribosides or deoxyribosides of adenine, thymine, 
guanine, cytosine, and uracil; polymers of the deoxyribose-5'-
monophosphates of thymine, cytosine, guanine, and adenine linked by 
successive 3'-5' phosphodiester bonds (also known as deoxyribonucleic 
acid); and polymers of the ribose-5'-monophosphates of uracil, cytosine, 
guanine, and adenine linked by successive 3'-5' phosphodiester bonds 
(also known as ribonucleic acid). The term does not apply to nucleic 
acid analogues (e.g., dideoxycytidine), or polymers containing nucleic 
acid analogues.
    Pesticidal substance, means a substance that is intended to be 
produced and used in a living plant, or in the produce thereof, for a 
pesticidal purpose, during any part of a plant's life cyle (e.g., in the 
embryo, seed, seedling, mature plant).
    Plant, for plant-incorporated protectants, means an organism 
classified using the 5-kingdom classification system of Whittaker in the 
kingdom Plantae. This includes, but is not limited to, bryophytes such 
as mosses, pteridophytes such as ferns, gymnosperms such as conifers, 
and

[[Page 377]]

angiosperms such as most major crop plants.
    Plant-incorporated protectant means a pesticidal substance that is 
intended to be produced and used in a living plant, or in the produce 
thereof, and the genetic material necessary for production of such a 
pesticidal substance. It also includes any inert ingredient contained in 
the plant, or produce thereof.
    Produce thereof, when used with respect to plants containing plant- 
incorporated protectants only, means a product of a living plant 
containing a plant-incorporated protectant, where the pesticidal 
substance is intended to serve a pesticidal purpose after the product 
has been separated from the living plant. Examples of such products 
include, but are not limited to, agricultural produce, grains, and 
lumber. Products such as raw agricultural commodities bearing pesticide 
chemical residues are not ``produce thereof'' when the residues are not 
intended to serve a pesticidal purpose in the produce.
    Recipient plant means the living plant in which the plant-
incorporated protectant is intended to be produced and used.
    Recombinant DNA means the genetic material has been manipulated in 
vitro through the use of restriction endonucleases and/or other enzymes 
that aid in modifying genetic material, and subsequently introduced into 
the genome of the plant.
    Regulatory region means genetic material that controls the 
expression of the genetic material that encodes a pesticidal substance 
or leads to the production of a pesticidal substance. Examples of 
regulatory regions include, but are not limited to, promoters, 
enhancers, and terminators.
    Sexually compatible, when referring to plants, means a viable zygote 
is formed only through the union of two gametes through conventional 
breeding.
    Source means the donor of the genetic material that encodes a 
pesticidal substance or leads to the production of a pesticidal 
substance.
    Vegetative reproduction means either:
    (1) In seed plants, reproduction by apomixis, or
    (2) In other plants, reproduction by fragmentation, or division of 
the somatic body.
    Wide crosses means to facilitate the formation of viable zygotes 
through the use of surgical alteration of the plant pistil, bud 
pollination, mentor pollen, immunosuppressants, in vitro fertilization, 
pre-pollination and post-pollination hormone treatments, manipulation of 
chromosome numbers, embryo culture, or ovary and ovule cultures.

Sec. 174.9  Confidential business information claims for plant-incorporated 

protectant submissions.

    Although it is strongly recommended that the submitter minimize the 
amount of data and other information claimed as Confidential Business 
Information (CBI), a submitter may assert a claim of confidentiality for 
all or part of the information submitted to EPA in a submission for a 
plant-incorporated protectant. (See part 2, subpart B of this chapter.) 
To assert such a claim, the submitter must comply with all of the 
following procedures:
    (a) Any claim of confidentiality must accompany the information at 
the time the information is submitted to EPA. Failure to assert a claim 
at that time constitutes a waiver of confidentiality for the information 
submitted, and the information may be made available to the public, 
subject to section 10(g) of FIFRA, with no further notice to the 
submitter.
    (b) Any claim of confidentiality must be accompanied, at the time 
the claim is made, by comments substantiating the claim and explaining 
why the submitter believes that the information should not be disclosed. 
The submitter must address each of the points listed in Sec. 
2.204(e)(4) of this chapter in the substantiation. EPA will consider 
incomplete all plant-incorporated protectant submissions containing 
information claimed as CBI that are not accompanied by substantiation, 
and will suspend any applicable review of such submissions until the 
required substantiation is provided.

produced and used in a crop used as food, the residues of the plant-
incorporated protectant are either exempted from the requirement of a 
tolerance under FFDCA (as amended, 21 U.S.C. 321 et seq.) as codified at 
Sec. Sec. 174.507 through 174.508, or no tolerance would otherwise be 
required for the plant-incorporated protectant.
    (c) Any inert ingredient that is part of the plant-incorporated 
protectant is on the list codified at Sec. 174.705. Plant-incorporated 
protectants that are not exempt from the requirements of FIFRA under 
this subpart are subject to all the requirements of FIFRA.

<R05>
Sec. 176.1  Scope and applicability.

    This part describes the procedures and criteria under which EPA will 
establish time-limited tolerances and exemptions from the requirement of 
a tolerance for pesticide chemical residues associated with use of 
pesticides under emergency or crisis exemptions under FIFRA section 18. 
This part applies only to tolerances issued on the initiative of EPA as 
the result of the issuance of an emergency exemption or the declaration 
of a crisis exemption. This part does not cover time-limited tolerances 
in any other circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 176.3  Definitions.

    The terms have the same meaning as in the Federal Insecticide, 
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act section 2, and in the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act section 201 and Sec. 166.3 of this chapter. In 
addition, the following terms are defined for the purposes of this part.
    Agency means the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
    Applicant means any entity authorized under section 18 of FIFRA to 
request an emergency exemption that requests such an exemption under 
Sec. 166.20 of this chapter, or issues a crisis exemption under Sec. 
166.40 of this chapter.
    Crisis exemption means an exemption authorized under FIFRA section 
18, in accordance with Sec. Sec. 166.40 through 166.53 of this chapter.
    Emergency exemption means a specific, quarantine, or public health 
exemption authorized under FIFRA section 18 and the regulations at 
Sec. Sec. 166.20 through 166.35 of this chapter.
    EPA means the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
    FFDCA means the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321 
et seq.).
    FIFRA means the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act 
(7 U.S.C 136 et seq.).
    Tolerance means the maximum amount of a pesticide chemical residue 
that may lawfully be present in or on a raw agricultural commodity, or 
processed food, or animal feed, expressed as

[[Page 384]]

parts per million by weight of the pesticide chemical residue in the 
food or feed.
    Tolerance exemption means a formal determination by the Agency 
pursuant to FFDCA section 408(c), 21 U.S.C 346a(c), that no tolerance is 
needed for a given pesticide chemical residue in or on a particular food 
commodity. For purposes of this part, the term ``tolerance'' shall 
include an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance.


<R05>
Sec. 176.5  Establishment of a time-limited tolerance or exemption.

    EPA will establish a time-limited tolerance for pesticide chemical 
residues in or on raw or processed food or feed resulting from the use 
of a pesticide chemical, if EPA authorizes an emergency exemption or a 
crisis exemption. EPA will consider establishing such a tolerance only 
if an applicant acting under authority of FIFRA section 18 either has 
requested an emergency exemption, has stated its intention to issue a 
crisis exemption, or has issued a crisis exemption for a use that may 
result, directly or indirectly, in pesticide chemical residues in food 
or feed.


<R05>
Sec. 176.7  Information needed to establish a tolerance.

    (a) EPA will establish a time-limited tolerance only if EPA can 
determine that the tolerance is safe, that is, there is a reasonable 
certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to the 
pesticide chemical residue. EPA will base its determination upon data 
submitted by the applicant and other readily available data. If, taking 
into account the limited duration and emergency nature of a section 18 
application, and based on the available data the Agency cannot conclude 
that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the 
use proposed by the applicant or granted pursuant to a crisis exemption, 
EPA will not establish a tolerance.
    (b) Data and other relevant information to support the establishment 
of a time-limited tolerance may be submitted by the applicant, or by any 
other person, in support of the time-limited tolerance. The applicant 
may also cite relevant data previously submitted to the Agency.


<R05>
Sec. 176.9  Publication of a tolerance.

    (a) If EPA issues an emergency exemption or crisis exemption under 
FIFRA section 18, and EPA concludes that the tolerance for residues 
resulting from use of the pesticide under the exemption will be safe, 
then EPA will establish the tolerance by publishing an amendment to 40 
CFR part 180 in the Federal Register.
    (b) A tolerance under this part may be established without prior 
publication of a proposed tolerance or comment period.


<R05>
Sec. 176.11  Duration of a tolerance.

    (a) Tolerances issued under this part will become effective upon 
publication in the Federal Register, unless otherwise specified by the 
Administrator.
    (b) Unless extended, tolerances will automatically expire and be 
revoked, without further action by EPA, at the time set out in the final 
rule published in Federal Register.
    (c) The Administrator may revoke a tolerance at any time if the 
Administrator determines that the tolerance is no longer safe.


<R05>
Sec. 176.13  Modification of a time-limited tolerance.

    If additional emergency or crisis exemptions are authorized that 
would extend use beyond the date originally authorized, or if EPA 
determines that the duration of a time-limited tolerance is insufficient 
to allow treated commodities to clear the channels of trade, EPA may 
modify the time-limited tolerance by publication of a final rule in the 
Federal Register. EPA will use the same criteria and procedures for 
modification as for establishing tolerances under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 176.15  Effect of a tolerance.

    The establishment of a tolerance under this part does not alter the 
requirement that any applicant comply with procedures established in 
part 166 of this chapter for emergency exemptions of FIFRA.

<R04>
   Subpart B_Procedures for Filing Objections and Requests for Hearing


<R05>
Sec. 178.20  Right to submit objections and requests for a hearing.

    (a) On or before the 60th day after the date of publication in the 
Federal Register of an order under part 180 of this chapter 
establishing, modifying, or revoking a regulation, or denying all or any 
portion of a petition, a person adversely affected by such order or 
petition denial may submit, in accordance with Sec. 178.25, one or more 
written objections to the order (or to the action that is the subject of 
the order).
    (b) A person may include with any such objection a written request 
for an evidentiary hearing on such objection in accordance with Sec. 
178.27
    (c) A person who submits objections need not request a hearing. For 
instance, if the person's objections are of a purely legal or policy 
nature, a hearing request would be inappropriate; the purpose of an 
evidentiary hearing is to resolve factual disputes. The Administrator 
will rule on the objections, whether or not a hearing is requested.
    (d) As a matter of discretion, the Administrator may order a hearing 
on an objection even though no person has requested a hearing.

[55 FR 50291, Dec. 5, 1990, as amended at 70 FR 33359, June 8, 2005]


<R05>
Sec. 178.25  Form and manner of submission of objections.

    (a) To be considered by the Administrator, an objection must:
    (1) Be in writing.
    (2) Specify with particularity the provision(s) of the order, 
regulation, or denial objected to, the basis for the objection(s), and 
the relief sought.
    (3) Be signed by the objector.
    (4) State the objector's name and mailing address.
    (5) Be accompanied by the fee prescribed by Sec. 180.33(i) of this 
chapter, if the objection is to an order or regulation issued under part 
180 of this chapter.
    (6) Be submitted to the hearing clerk.
    (7) Be received by the Hearing Clerk not later than the close of 
business of the 60th day following the date of the publication in the 
Federal Register

[[Page 386]]

of the order to which the objection is taken (or, if such 60th day is a 
Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, not later than the close of 
business of the next government business day after such 60th day).
    (b) Submissions to the hearing clerk shall be made as follows:
    (1) Mailed submissions should be addressed to: Office of the Hearing 
Clerk (1900L), Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., 
NW., Washington, DC 20460-0001.
    (2) For hand/courier delivery the Office of the Hearing Clerk is 
located at Suite 350, 1099 14\th\ St., NW., Washington, DC 20005.

FR 33359, June 8, 2005; 71 FR 35546, June 21, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 178.27  Form and manner of submission of request for evidentiary hearing.

    To be considered by the Administrator, a request for an evidentiary 
hearing must meet the criteria in Sec. 178.32, and must:
    (a) Be submitted as a part of, and specifically request an 
evidentiary hearing on an objection that complies with the requirements 
of Sec. 178.25.
    (b) Include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing 
is requested and the requestor's contentions on each such issue.
    (c) Include a copy of any report, article, survey, or other written 
document (or the pertinent pages thereof) upon which the objector relies 
to justify an evidentiary hearing, unless the document is an EPA 
document that is routinely available to any member of the public.
    (d) Include a summary of any evidence not described in paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section upon which the objector relies to justify an 
evidentiary hearing.
    (e) Include a discussion of the relationship between the factual 
issues and the relief requested by the objection.


<R05>
Sec. 178.30  Response by Administrator to objections and to requests for hearing.

    The Administrator will respond to objections, and to requests for a 
hearing on such objections, as set forth in this section.
    (a) Denial of objections that are improperly submitted or that seek 
an unavailable form of relief. The Administrator will by order issued 
under Sec. 178.37 deny each objection and each request for a hearing 
that is included with such an objection, if:
    (1) The objection is found not to conform to Sec. 178.25.
    (2) The action requested by the objection is inconsistent with any 
provision of FFDCA.
    (3) The action requested by the objection is inconsistent with any 
generic, e.g., non-chemical specific, interpretation of a provision of 
FFDCA in any regulation in this chapter (the proper procedure in such a 
case is for the person to petition for an amendment of the regulation 
involved).
    (b) Denial of improperly submitted requests for hearing. The 
Administrator will then determine whether any objection that has not 
been denied under paragraph (a) of this section was accompanied by a 
request for an evidentiary hearing that conforms to Sec. 178.27. The 
Administrator will deny under Sec. 178.37 each request that does not 
conform to Sec. 178.27.
    (c) Grouping of certain related objections. If the Administrator 
then finds (1) That two or more undenied objections are substantially 
similar, or are related in such a way that any judicial review of the 
Administrator's action on those objections should occur at the same 
time, and (2) that one or more of those objections was accompanied by an 
undenied request for an evidentiary hearing on that objection, the 
Administrator will treat those objections as a group and will rule on 
them only after ruling under Sec. 178.32 on the associated request for 
hearing.
    (d) Rulings on objections for which a request for hearing has been 
granted. If the Administrator rules under Sec. 178.32 that an 
evidentiary hearing should be held on an objection, the Administrator 
will resolve the issues raised by any other objection grouped with it 
under paragraph (c) of this section in conjunction with the evidentiary 
hearing upon which the hearing request was granted, unless the 
Administrator for good cause determines otherwise.
    (e) Rulings on objections for which no request for hearing was 
received, or for

[[Page 387]]

which each request for hearing was denied. Except as provided in 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, if no hearing was requested on 
an objection, or if each such request that was made is denied under the 
criteria of paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section or Sec. 178.32(b), 
the Administrator will rule on the objection under Sec. 178.37.


<R05>
Sec. 178.32  Rulings on requests for hearing.

    (a) In the case of each request for an evidentiary hearing that was 
not denied under Sec. 178.30(a) or (b), the Administrator will 
determine whether such a hearing on one or more of the objections is 
justified, and will publish in the Federal Register the determination in 
an order issued under Sec. 178.37 or a Notice of Hearing issued under 
Sec. 179.20 of this chapter. If some requests for a hearing are denied 
and others pertaining to the same order or regulation are granted, the 
denial order and the hearing notice may be combined into a single 
document and shall be issued at the same time unless the Administrator 
for good cause determines otherwise.
    (b) A request for an evidentiary hearing will be granted if the 
Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the 
following:
    (1) There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact for resolution 
at a hearing. An evidentiary hearing will not be granted on issues of 
policy or law.
    (2) There is a reasonable possibility that available evidence 
identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more 
of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account 
uncontested claims or facts to the contrary. An evidentiary hearing will 
not be granted on the basis of mere allegations, denials, or general 
descriptions of positions and contentions, nor if the Administrator 
concludes that the data and information submitted, even if accurate, 
would be insufficient to justify the factual determination urged.
    (3) Resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the 
person requesting the hearing would be adequate to justify the action 
requested. An evidentiary hearing will not be granted on factual issues 
that are not determinative with respect to the action requested. For 
example, a hearing will not be granted if the Administrator concludes 
that the action would be the same even if the factual issue were 
resolved in the manner sought.
    (c) Where appropriate, the Administrator will make rulings on any 
issues raised by an objection which are necessary for resolution prior 
to determining whether a request for an evidentiary hearing should be 
granted.


<R05>
Sec. 178.35  Modification or revocation of regulation or prior order.

    (a) If the Administrator determines upon review of an objection or 
request for hearing that the regulation or prior order in question 
should be modified or revoked, the Administrator will publish an order 
setting forth any revision to the regulation or prior order that the 
Administrator has found to be warranted.
    (b) The Administrator will provide an opportunity for objections and 
requests for hearing on such order to the extent required by law. Such 
objections to the modification or revocation of the regulation, and 
requests for a hearing on such objections, may be submitted under 
Sec. Sec. 178.20 through 178.27.
    (c) Objections and requests for hearing that are not affected by the 
modification or revocation will remain on file and be acted upon in 
accordance with this part.

[55 FR 50291, Dec. 5, 1990, as amended at 70 FR 33359, June 8, 2005]


<R05>
Sec. 178.37  Order responding to objections on which a hearing was

not requested or was denied.

    (a) The Administrator will publish in the Federal Register an order 
under FFDCA section 408(g)(2)(B) or section 408(g)(2)(C) setting forth 
the Administrator's determination on each denial of a request for a 
hearing, and on each objection submitted under Sec. 178.20 on which:
    (1) A hearing was not requested.
    (2) A hearing was requested, but denied.
    (b) Each order published under paragraph (a) of this section must 
state the reasons for the Administrator's determination. If the order 
denies a request for a hearing on the objection, the

[[Page 388]]

order also must state the reason for that denial (e.g., why the request 
for a hearing did not conform to Sec. 178.27, or why the request was 
denied under Sec. 178.32).
    (c) Each order published under paragraph (a) of this section must 
state its effective date.

<R05>
Sec. 178.65  Judicial review.

    An order issued under Sec. 178.37 is final agency action reviewable 
in the courts as provided by FFDCA section 408(h), as of the date of 
publication of the order in the Federal Register. The failure to file a 
petition for judicial review within the period ending on the 60th day 
after the date of the publication of the order constitutes a waiver 
under FFDCA section 408(h) of the right to judicial review of the order 
and of any regulation promulgated by the order.

<R05>
Sec. 178.70  Administrative record.

    (a) For purposes of judicial review, the record of an administrative 
proceeding that culminates in an order under Sec. 178.37 consists of:
    (1) The objection ruled on (and any request for hearing that was 
included with the objection).
    (2) Any order issued under Sec. 180.7(g) of this chapter to which 
the objection related, and:
    (i) Any regulation or petition denial that was the subject of that 
order.
    (ii) The petition to which such order responded.
    (iii) Any amendment or supplement of the petition.
    (iv) The data and information submitted in support of the petition.
    (v) The notice of filing of the petition.
    (3) Any order issued under Sec. 180.29(f) of this chapter to which 
the objection related, the regulation that was the subject of that 
order, and each related Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.
    (4) Any comments submitted by members of the public in response to

<R05>
Sec. 179.24  Ex parte discussions; separation of functions.

    (a) Any person may meet or correspond with any officer or employee 
of the Agency concerning a matter under parts 178 or 180 of this chapter 
prior to publication of a Notice of Hearing under Sec. 179.20.
    (b) Upon publication of a Notice of Hearing, the following 
separation of function rules apply:
    (1) OPPTS, as a party to the hearing, is responsible for 
presentation of its position at the hearing and in any pleading or oral 
argument before the Administrator. The Pesticides and Toxic Substances 
Division of the Office of General Counsel shall advise and represent 
OPPTS with respect to the hearing and in any pleading or oral argument 
before the Administrator. An employee or other representatives of OPPTS 
may not participate in or advise the Administrator or any of his 
representatives on any decision under this part, other than as witness 
or counsel in public proceedings, except as provided by paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section. There is to be no other communication between 
representatives of OPPTS and the presiding officer or any representative 
of the Office of the Administrator concerning the merits of the hearing 
until after issuance of the decision of the Administrator.
    (2) The Administrator may designate persons who otherwise would be 
regarded as representatives of OPPTS, to serve as representatives of the 
Office of the Administrator on matters pertaining to the hearing, and 
may also designate persons who otherwise would be regarded as 
representatives of the Office of the Administrator to serve as 
representatives of OPPTS. Such designations will be included in the 
Notice of Hearing published underSec. 179.20.
    (3) The Office of the Administrator is responsible for the final 
decision of the matter, with the advice and participation of anyone in 
the Agency other than representatives of OPPTS.
    (c) Between the date of publication of the Notice of Hearing and the 
date of the Administrator's final decision on the matter, communication 
concerning the matter involved in the hearing will be restricted as 
follows:
    (1) No person outside the Agency may have an ex parte communication 
with the presiding officer or any representative of the Office of the 
Administrator concerning the merits of the hearing. Neither the 
presiding officer nor any representative of the Office of the 
Administrator may have any ex parte communication with a person outside 
the Agency concerning the merits of the hearing.
    (2) A written communication contrary to this section must be 
immediately served on all other participants and filed with the hearing 
clerk by the presiding officer at the hearing, or by the Administrator, 
depending on who received the communication. An oral communication 
contrary to this section must be immediately recorded in a written 
memorandum and similarly served on all other parties and filed with the 
hearing clerk. A person, including a representative of a party in the 
hearing, who is involved in an oral communication contrary to this 
section, must, to the extent necessary to determine the substance of the 
communication, be made available for cross-examination during the 
hearing with

[[Page 391]]

respect to the substance of that communication. Rebuttal testimony 
pertinent to a written or oral communication contrary to this section 
will be permitted.
    (d) The prohibitions specified in paragraph (c) of this section also 
apply to a person who, in advance of the publication of a Notice of 
Hearing, knows that the notice has been signed. The prohibitions become 
applicable to such a person as of the time the knowledge is acquired.
    (e) The making of a communication contrary to this section may, 
consistent with the interests of justice and the policies underlying the 
FFDCA, result in a decision adverse to the person knowingly making or 
causing the making of the communication.

    (a) A deciding official in a hearing under this part (including, 
e.g., the Administrator, judicial officer, or presiding officer) shall

herself and withdraw from the proceeding. The party may obtain 
interlocutory review by the Administrator of a denial of such a request

shall withdraw from the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 179.78  Unavailability of presiding officer.

hearing under this part regarding any matter to be decided by the 
presiding officer, the judicial officer, or the Administrator shall be 
filed in triplicate with the hearing clerk, in the manner specified by 
Sec. 178.25(b) of this chapter. Each filing shall prominently note the 
docket number. To determine compliance with deadlines in a hearing, a 
document is considered filed on the date it is actually received by the 
hearing clerk. When this part allows a response by a party to a 
submission and prescribes a period of time for the filing of the 
response, an additional 3 days are allowed for the filing of the 
response if the submission is served by mail.

[[Page 393]]

filed with the hearing clerk. The hearing clerk shall immediately serve

    (c) At the same time that a party files any document with the 
hearing clerk, the party shall serve a copy thereof on each other party, 
unless the presiding officer specifies otherwise. Each filing shall be 
accompanied by a certificate of service, or a statement that service is 
not required. Service on a party is accomplished by mailing a submission 
to the address shown in the Notice of Participation or by personal 
delivery.
    (d) The presiding officer may grant an extension of time for the 
filing of any pleading, document, or motion (1) Upon timely motion by a 
party, for good cause shown, and after consideration of prejudice to 
other parties, or (2) upon the presiding officer's own motion.
    (e) A motion by a party for an extension may only be made after 
serving a copy of the motion on all other parties, unless the movant can 
show good cause why doing so is impracticable. The motion shall be filed 
in advance of the date on which the pleading, document, or motion is due 
to be filed, unless the failure of the party to make a timely motion for 
an extension was the result of excusable neglect.


<R05>
Sec. 179.81  Availability of documents.

    (a) All orders, decisions, pleadings, transcripts, exhibits, and 
other docket entries shall become part of the official docket and shall 
be retained by the hearing clerk. Except as otherwise provided by 
paragraph (b) of this section or part 2 of this chapter, all documents 
that are a part of the official docket shall be made available to the 
public for reasonable inspection during Agency business hours. Copies of 
such documents may be obtained by members of the public as provided in 
part 2 of this chapter.
    (b) Whenever any information or data are required to be produced or 
examined in a hearing and any party makes a business confidentiality 
claim regarding such information under part 2 of this chapter, the 
availability of such information to the other parties or to the public 
shall be determined by EPA in accordance with part 2 of this chapter, 
including specifically the procedures and principles set forth in Sec. 
2.30l(g)(3) and (g)(4) of this chapter. The presiding officer shall make 
the determinations with respect to the matters referred to in Sec. 
2.301(g)(3) and (g)(4) to the extent provided, and shall take such steps 
as are necessary for the protection of information entitled to 
confidential treatment or otherwise exempt from public disclosure, 
including issuance of protective orders to parties or taking testimony 
in a closed hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 179.83  Disclosure of data and information.

    (a) Within 60 days of the publication of the Notice of Hearing under 
Sec. l79.20, or, if no party will be prejudiced, within another period 
set by the presiding officer, the Assistant Administrator shall file 
with the hearing clerk, in accordance with Sec. 179.80, the following 
documents numbered and organized in the manner prescribed by the 
presiding officer:

developed under part 178 of this chapter, and under part 180 of this 
chapter, that are relevant to the issues in the hearing.
    (2) All documents in the files of OPPTS containing factual 
information or expert opinion, whether favorable or unfavorable to the 
position of OPPTS, which relate to the issues involved in the hearing. 
For purposes of this paragraph, ``files'' means the principal files in 
OPPTS in which documents relating to each of the issues in the hearing 
are ordinarily kept. Documents that are internal memoranda reflecting 
the deliberative process, or are attorney work product, or were prepared 
specifically for use in connection with the hearing, are not required to 
be submitted.
    (3) All other documentary data and information upon which OPPTS 
plans to rely upon in the hearing.
    (4) A narrative position statement on the factual issues in the 
Notice of Hearing and the nature of the supporting evidence that OPPTS 
intends to introduce.

[[Page 394]]

    (5) A signed statement that, to the best knowledge and belief of the 
Assistant Administrator, the submission complies with this section.
    (b) Within 70 days of the publication of the Notice of Hearing or, 
if no party will be prejudiced, within another period of time set by the 
presiding officer, each party other than OPPTS shall submit to the 
hearing clerk in accordance with Sec. 179.80 the following documents, 
numbered and organized in the manner prescribed by the presiding 
officer:
    (1) Any objections that the administrative record filed under 
paragraph (a)(l) of this section is incomplete.
    (2) All documents (other than those filed under paragraph (a) of 
this section) in the party's files containing factual information or 
expert opinion, whether favorable or unfavorable to the party's 
position, that relates to the issues involved in the hearing. For 
purposes of this paragraph, ``files'' means the party's principal files 
in which documents relating to each of the issues in the hearing are 
ordinarily kept. Documents that are attorney work product, or were 
prepared specifically for use in connection with the hearing, are not 
required to be submitted.
    (3) All other documentary data and information the party plans to 
rely upon in the hearing.
    (4) A narrative position statement on the factual issues in the 
Notice of Hearing and the nature of the supporting evidence the party 
intends to introduce.
    (5) A signed statement that, to the best knowledge and belief of the 
party, the submission complies with this section.
    (c) Submissions required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section 
may be supplemented later in the proceeding, with the approval of the 
presiding officer, upon a showing that the material contained in the 
supplement was not reasonably known by or available to the party when 
the submission was made or that the relevance of the material contained 
in the supplement could not reasonably have been foreseen.
    (d) If a party fails to comply substantially and in good faith with 
this section, the presiding officer may infer that such failure was for 
the purpose of withholding information that is unfavorable to the 
party's position, and may make such further adverse inferences and 
findings with respect to such failure as are warranted.
    (e) Parties may reference each other's submissions. To reduce 
duplicative submissions, parties are encouraged to exchange and 
consolidate lists of documentary evidence. If a particular document is 
bulky or in limited supply and cannot reasonably be reproduced, and it 
constitutes relevant evidence, the presiding officer may authorize 
submission of a reduced number of copies.
    (f) The presiding officer will rule on questions relating to this 
section.

[55 FR 50293, Dec. 5, 1990, as amended at 57 FR 28087, June 24, 1992; 70 
FR 33359, June 8, 2005]


<R05>
Sec. 179.85  Purpose of preliminary conference.

    The presiding officer will conduct one or more preliminary 
conferences for the following purposes:
    (a) To determine the areas of factual disagreement to be considered 
at the hearing.
    (b) To establish any necessary procedural rules to control the 
course of the hearing and the schedule for the hearing.
    (c) To group parties with substantially similar interests, for 
purposes of presenting evidence, making objections, cross-examination, 
and presenting oral argument.
    (d) To obtain stipulations and admissions of facts.
    (e) To take other action that may expedite the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 179.86  Time and place of preliminary conference.

    A preliminary conference will commence at the date, time, and place 
announced in the Notice of Hearing, or as otherwise specified by the 
Administrator or presiding officer in a subsequent notice. The 
preliminary conference may not commence until after expiration of the 
time for filing notices of participation under Sec. 179.42. The 
presiding officer may specify that two or more such conferences shall be 
held.

[[Page 395]]


<R05>
Sec. 179.87  Procedures for preliminary conference.

    Parties in a hearing must appear at the preliminary conference(s) 
prepared to present a position on the matters specified in Sec. 179.85. 
A preliminary conference may be held by telephone, or other electronic 
means, if appropriate.
    (a) To expedite the hearing, parties are encouraged to prepare in 
advance for the conference. Parties should cooperate with each other and 
should request information and begin preparation of testimony at the 
earliest possible time. Failure of a party to appear at the preliminary 
conference or to raise matters that could reasonably be anticipated and 
resolved at that time will not delay the progress of the hearing, and 
constitutes a waiver of the rights of the party regarding such matters 
as objections to the agreements reached, actions taken, or rulings 
issued. Such failure to appear may also be grounds for striking the 
party's participation under Sec. 179.42(f).
    (b) Each party shall bring to the preliminary conference the 
following specific information, which will be filed with the hearing 
clerk under Sec. 179.80:
    (1) Any additional information to supplement the submission which 
may have been filed under Sec. 179.83, and/or which may be filed if 
approved under Sec. 179.83(c).
    (2) A list setting forth each person who has been identified as a 
witness whose oral or written testimony will be offered by the party at 
the hearing, with a full curriculum vitae for each and a summary of the 
expected testimony (including a list of the principal exhibits on which 
the witness will rely) or a statement as to when such a summary will be 
furnished. A party may amend its witness and document list to add, 
delete, or substitute witnesses or documents.
    (c) The presiding officer may hold preliminary conferences off the 
record in an effort to reach agreement on disputed factual or procedural 
questions.
    (d) The presiding officer shall issue and file under Sec. 179.80 a 
written order reciting the actions taken at each preliminary conference 
and setting forth the schedule for the hearing. The order will control 
the subsequent course of the hearing unless modified by the presiding 
officer for good cause.


<R05>
Sec. 179.89  Motions.

    A motion, unless made in the course of a preliminary conference or a 
transcribed oral hearing before the presiding officer, must be filed in 
the manner prescribed by Sec. 179.80 and include a draft order. A 
response may be filed within 10 days of service of a motion. The moving 
party has no right to reply, except as permitted by the presiding 
officer. The presiding officer shall rule upon the motion.


<R05>
Sec. 179.90  Summary decisions.

    (a) After the hearing commences, a party may file a written motion, 
with or without supporting affidavits or brief, for a summary decision 
on any issue in the hearing. Any other party may, within 10 days after 
service of the motion, which time may be extended for an additional 10 
days for good cause shown, serve opposing affidavits or brief or 
countermove for summary decision. The presiding officer may set the 
matter for argument and call for the submission of briefs if not 
submitted by the parties.
    (b) The presiding officer will grant the motion if the objections, 
requests for hearing, other pleadings, affidavits, and other material 
filed in connection with the hearing, or matters officially noticed, 
show that there is no genuine disagreement as to any material fact 
bearing on the issue and that a party is entitled to summary decision.
    (c) Affidavits should set forth facts that would be admissible in 
evidence and show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify 
to the matters stated. When a properly supported motion for summary 
decision is made, a party opposing the motion may not rest upon mere 
allegations or denials or general descriptions of positions and 
contentions; affidavits or other responses must demonstrate specifically 
that there is a genuine issue of material fact for the hearing.
    (d) Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the 
motion that for sound reasons stated, facts essential to justify the 
opposition cannot be presented by affidavit, the presiding

[[Page 396]]

officer may deny the motion for summary decision, order a continuance to 
permit affidavits or additional evidence to be obtained, or issue other 
just order.
    (e) If a summary decision is not rendered upon all issues or for all 
the relief asked, and evidentiary facts need to be developed, the 
presiding officer will issue an order specifying the facts that appear 
without substantial controversy and directing further evidentiary 
proceedings. The facts so specified will be deemed established.
    (f) A party may obtain interlocutory review by the Administrator of 
a summary decision of the presiding officer.


<R05>
Sec. 179.91  Burden of going forward; burden of persuasion.

    (a) The party whose request for an evidentiary hearing was granted 
has the burden of going forward in the hearing with evidence as to the 
issues relevant to that request for a hearing.
    (b) The party or parties who contend that a regulation satisfies the 
criteria of section 408 of the FFDCA has the burden of persuasion in the 
hearing on that issue, whether the proceeding concerns the 
establishment, modification, or revocation of a tolerance or exemption 
from the requirement for a tolerance.

<R05>
Sec. 179.93  Testimony.

    (a) The presiding officer will conduct such proceedings as are 
necessary for the taking of oral direct testimony and for the conduct of 
oral examination of witnesses by the parties. The presiding officer 
shall limit oral examination to prevent irrelevant, immaterial or unduly 
repetitious examination.
    (b) Direct testimony shall be submitted in writing, except that the 
presiding officer may order direct testimony to be presented orally in 
those unusual cases where the memory or demeanor of the witness is of 
importance. Written direct testimony shall be in the form of a verified 
statement of fact or opinion prepared by the witness, in narrative form 
or in question-and-answer form. Written direct testimony may incorporate 
exhibits. Such a verified statement or exhibit may not be admitted into 
evidence sooner than 14 days (or such other reasonable period as the 
presiding officer may order) after the witness has delivered to the 
presiding officer and each party a copy of the statement or exhibit. The 
admissibility of the evidence contained in such a statement is subject 
to the same rules as if such testimony had been given orally.
    (c) Oral cross-examination of witnesses will be permitted. Each 
exhibit that a party intends to rely upon in cross-examining a witness 
shall be furnished to the other parties not later than 3 days (or such 
other reasonable period as the presiding officer may order) before such 
exhibit is used in the cross-examination.
    (d) Witnesses shall give testimony under oath or affirmation.


<R05>
Sec. 179.94  Transcripts.

    (a) The hearing clerk shall make arrangements to have all oral 
testimony stenographically reported or recorded and transcribed, with 
evidence that is admitted in the form of written testimony or exhibits 
attached or incorporated as appropriate.
    (b) Unless the presiding officer orders otherwise, parties shall 
have 15 days from the date that the transcript of particular oral 
testimony first becomes available to propose corrections in the 
transcript of that testimony. Corrections are permitted only for 
transcription errors. The presiding officer shall promptly order 
justified corrections.
    (c) As soon as practicable after the taking of the last evidence, 
the presiding officer shall certify:
    (1) That the original transcript is a true transcript of the oral 
testimony offered or received at the hearing, except in such particulars 
as the presiding officer specifies.
    (2) That the written testimony and exhibits accompanying the 
transcript are all the written testimony and exhibits introduced at the 
hearing, with such exceptions as the presiding officer specifies.
    (3) The transcript with attached or incorporated material, as so 
certified by the presiding officer, shall be submitted to and filed by 
the hearing clerk under Sec. 179.80.

[[Page 397]]

    (d) Copies of the transcript shall be available to the public in 
accordance with Sec. 179.81; parties may make special arrangements 
through the hearing clerk to obtain copies on an ongoing, expedited 
basis.


<R05>
Sec. 179.95  Admission or exclusion of evidence; objections; offers of proof.

    (a) Written material identified as direct testimony or as an 
evidentiary exhibit and offered by a party in a hearing, and oral 
testimony, whether on direct or on cross-examination, is admissible as 
evidence unless the presiding officer excludes it (on objection of a 
party or on the presiding officer's own initiative) because it is 
irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitive, or because its exclusion 
is necessary to enforce a specific requirement of this part relating to 
the admissibility of evidence.
    (b) If a party objects to the admission or rejection of any evidence 
or to the limitation of the scope of any examination or cross-
examination, the party shall state briefly the grounds for such 
objection. The transcript shall include any argument or debate thereon, 
unless the presiding officer, with the consent of all the parties, 
orders that such argument not be transcribed. The ruling and the reasons 
given therefor by the presiding officer on any objection shall be a part 
of the transcript. An automatic exception to that ruling will follow.
    (c) Whenever evidence is deemed inadmissible, the party offering 
such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall be included in the 
transcript. The offer of proof for excluded oral testimony shall consist 
of a brief statement describing the nature of the evidence excluded. If 
the evidence consists of a document or exhibit, it shall be inserted in 
the record in total. If the Administrator in reviewing the record under 
Sec. 179.112 decides that the presiding officer's ruling in excluding 
the evidence was erroneous and prejudicial, the hearing may be reopened 
to permit the taking of such evidence, or, where appropriate, the 
Administrator may evaluate the evidence and proceed to a final decision.
    (d) Official notice may be taken of Agency proceedings, any matter 
that might be judicially noticed by the courts of the United States, or 
any other fact within the knowledge and experience of the Agency as an 
expert agency. Any party shall be given adequate opportunity to show 
that such facts are erroneously noticed by presenting evidence to the 
contrary.


<R05>
Sec. 179.97  Conferences during hearing.

    The presiding officer may schedule and hold conferences as needed to 
monitor the progress of the hearing, narrow and simplify the issues, and 
consider and rule on motions, requests, or other matters concerning the 
development of the evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 179.98  Briefs and arguments.

    (a) Promptly after the taking of evidence is completed, the 
presiding officer will announce a schedule for the filing of briefs. 
Briefs must include a statement of position on each issue, with specific 
and complete citations to the evidence and points of law relied on. 
Briefs must contain proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.
    (b) The presiding officer may, as a matter of discretion, permit 
oral argument after the briefs are filed.


<R04>
                     Subpart F_Decisions and Appeals


<R05>
Sec. 179.101  Interlocutory appeal from ruling of presiding officer.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section and in 
Sec. Sec. 179.20(b), 179.42(f), 179.75(b), and 179.90(f), rulings of 
the presiding officer may not be appealed to the Administrator before 
the Administrator's consideration of the entire record of the hearing.
    (b) A ruling of the presiding officer is subject to interlocutory 
appeal to the Administrator if the presiding officer certifies on the 
record or by document submitted under Sec. 179.80 that immediate review 
is necessary to prevent exceptional delay, expense, or prejudice to any 
party or substantial harm to the public interest. When an order or 
ruling is not certified by the presiding officer, it shall be reviewed 
by the Administrator only upon appeal from the initial decision except 
when the Administrator determines upon the request of a party and in 
exceptional circumstances, that delaying review

[[Page 398]]

would be deleterious to vital public or private interests. Except in 
extraordinary circumstances, proceedings will not be stayed pending an 
interlocutory appeal. Where a stay is granted, a stay of more than 30 
days must be approved by the Administrator.
    (c) Ordinarily, the interlocutory appeal will be decided on the 
basis of the submission made to the presiding officer, but the 
Administrator may allow further briefs and oral arguments. Any oral 
argument will be transcribed and the transcript will be prepared and 
certified in the same manner as provided in Sec. 179.94.


<R05>
Sec. 179.105  Initial decision.

    (a) After the filing of briefs and any oral argument, the presiding 
officer shall prepare and file an initial decision on the issues of fact 
in the hearing and the objections relating to those issues.
    (b) The initial decision must be based on a fair evaluation of the 
entire record, and must contain:
    (1)(i) A conclusion that no change is warranted in the order or 
regulation to which objection was taken; or
    (ii) A conclusion that changes in the order or regulation are 
warranted, the language of the order or regulation as changed, and an 
effective date for the order or regulation as changed.
    (2) Findings of fact supported by reliable, probative and 
substantial evidence that has been found admissible by the presiding 
officer, and adequate citations to the record supporting those findings.
    (3) Conclusions on legal and policy issues, if such conclusions are 
necessary to resolve the objections.
    (4) A discussion of the reasons for the findings and conclusions, 
including a discussion of the significant contentions made by any party.
    (c) Except as otherwise provided by order of the Administrator filed 
in accordance with Sec. 179.80, after the initial decision is filed, 
the presiding officer has no further jurisdiction over the matter and 
any motions or requests filed with the hearing clerk will be decided by 
the Administrator.
    (d) The initial decision becomes the final decision of the 
Administrator by operation of law unless a party files exceptions with 
the hearing clerk under Sec. 179.107 or the Administrator files a 
notice of review under Sec. 179.110.

[55 FR 50293, Dec. 5, 1990, as amended at 70 FR 33360, June 8, 2005]


<R05>
Sec. 179.107  Appeal from or review of initial decision.

    (a) A party may appeal an initial decision to the Administrator by 
filing exceptions with the hearing clerk, and serving them on the other 
parties, within the period specified in the initial decision. The period 
may not exceed 30 days, unless extended by the Administrator under 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) Exceptions must specifically identify alleged errors in the 
findings of fact or conclusions of law or policy in the initial decision 
and, if errors in the findings of fact are alleged, must provide 
supporting citations to evidence of record. Oral argument before the 
Administrator may be requested in the exceptions.
    (c) Any reply to the exceptions is to be filed and served within the 
timeperiod specified in the initial decision. The timeperiod may not 
exceed 30 days after the end of the period (including any extensions) 
for filing exceptions, unless extended by the Administrator under 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) The Administrator may extend the time for filing exceptions or 
replies to exceptions for good cause shown.
    (e) If the Administrator decides to hear oral argument, the parties 
will be informed of the date, time, and place; the amount of time 
allotted to each party, and the issues to be addressed.


<R05>
Sec. 179.110  Determination by Administrator to review initial decision.

    Within 10 days following the expiration of the time for filing 
exceptions (including any extensions), the Administrator may file with 
the hearing clerk, and serve on the parties, a notice of the 
Administrator's determination to review the initial decision. The 
Administrator may invite the parties to file briefs or present oral 
argument on the matter. The time for filing briefs or presenting oral 
argument will be specified in that or a later notice.

[[Page 399]]


<R05>
Sec. 179.112  Decision by Administrator on appeal or review of initial decision.

    (a) On appeal from or review of the initial decision, the 
Administrator shall have the same powers as did the presiding officer in 
making the initial decision. On the Administrator's own initiative or on 
motion, the Administrator may remand the matter to the presiding officer 
for any further action necessary for a proper decision.
    (b) The scope of the issues on appeal to, or on review by the 
Administrator is the same as the scope of the issues before the 
presiding officer, unless the Administrator specifies otherwise.
    (c) After the filing of briefs and any oral argument, the 
Administrator will issue a final decision on the issues of fact in the 
hearing and the objections related to those issues. A final decision 
must contain the elements required for an initial decision by Sec. 
179.105(b).
    (d) The Administrator may adopt the initial decision as the final 
decision.
    (e) The Administrator's decision, or a summary of the decision and a 
notice of its availability, will be published in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 179.115  Motion to reconsider a final order.

    A party may file a motion requesting the Administrator to reconsider 
a final decision under this part. Any such motion must be filed within 
10 days after service of the final decision, and must set forth the 
matters claimed to have been erroneously decided and the nature of the 
alleged errors. Such a motion shall not stay the effective date of the 
final decision unless specifically so ordered by the Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 179.117  Designation and powers of judicial officer.

    (a) One or more judicial officers may be designated by the 
Administrator. A judicial officer shall be an attorney who is a 
permanent or temporary employee of the Agency or of another Federal 
agency. A judicial officer may perform other duties. A judicial officer 
who performs any duty under this part may not be employed by OPPTS, by 
the Pesticides and Toxic Substances Division of the Office of General 
Counsel, or by any other person who is a representative of OPPTS in the 
hearing. A person may not be designated as a judicial officer in a 
hearing if he or she performed any prosecutorial or investigative 
functions in connection with that hearing or any other factually related 
hearing.
    (b) The Administrator may delegate to the judicial officer all or 
part of the Administrator's authority to act in a given proceeding under 
this part. Such a delegation does not prevent the judicial officer from 
referring any motion or case to the Administrator when appropriate.

<R04>
                        Subpart G_Judicial Review


<R05>
Sec. 179.125  Judicial review.

    (a) The Administrator's final decision is final agency action 
reviewable in the courts as provided by FFDCA section 408(h), as of the 
date of publication of the order in the Federal Register. The failure of 
a person to file a petition for judicial review within the period ending 
on the 60th day after the date of the publication of the order 
constitutes a waiver under FFDCA section 408(h) of the right to judicial 
review of the order and of any regulation promulgated by the order.
    (b) The record for judicial review of a final decision under this 
part consists of the record described in Sec. 179.130.

[55 FR 50293, Dec. 5, 1990, as amended at 70 FR 33360, June 8, 2005]


<R05>
Sec. 179.130  Administrative record.

    (a) For purposes of judicial review, the record of a hearing that 
culminates in a final decision of the Administrator under Sec. 
179.105(d) or Sec. 179.112(c) ruling on an objection shall consist of:
    (1) The objection ruled on (and any request for hearing that was 
included with the objection).
    (2) Any order issued under Sec. 180.7(g) of this chapter to which 
the objection related, and:

[[Page 400]]

    (iv) The data and information submitted in support of the petition.
    (v) The notice of filing of the petition.
    (3) Any order issued under Sec. 180.29(f) of this chapter to which

    (4) The comments submitted by members of the public in response to 
the Notice of Filing or Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, and the 
information submitted as part of the comments, the Administrator's 
response to comments and the documents or information relied on by the 
Administrator in issuing the regulation or order.
    (5) All other documents or information submitted to the docket for 
the rulemaking in question under parts 177 or part 180 of this chapter.
    (6) The Notice of Hearing published under Sec. 179.20.
    (7) All notices of participation filed under Sec. 179.42.
    (8) Any Federal Register notice issued under this part that pertains

<R05>
Sec. 180.1  Definitions and interpretations.

    (a) Administrator, without qualification, means the Administrator of 
the Environmental Protection Agency.
    (b) Agency, without qualification, means the Environmental 
Protection Agency.
    (c) FFDCA means the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as 
amended, 21 U.S.C. 301-392.
    (d) Raw agricultural commodities include, among other things, fresh 
fruits, whether or not they have been washed and colored or otherwise 
treated in their unpeeled natural form; vegetables in their raw or 
natural state, whether or not they have been stripped of their outer 
leaves, waxed, prepared into fresh green salads, etc.; grains, nuts, 
eggs, raw milk, meats, and similar agricultural produce. It does not 
include foods that have been processed, fabricated, or manufactured by 
cooking, freezing, dehydrating, or milling.
    (e) Where a raw agricultural commodity bearing a pesticide chemical 
residue that has been exempted from the requirement of a tolerance, or 
which is within a tolerance permitted under FFDCA section 408, is used 
in preparing a processed food, the processed food will not be considered 
unsafe within the meaning of FFDCA sections 402 and 408(a), despite the 
lack of a tolerance or exemption for the pesticide chemical residue in 
the processed food, if:
    (1) The pesticide chemical has been used in or on the raw 
agricultural commodity in conformity with a tolerance under this 
section;
    (2) The pesticide chemical residue has been removed to the extent 
possible in good manufacturing practice; and
    (3) The concentration of the pesticide chemical residue in the 
processed food

[[Page 410]]

is not greater than the tolerance prescribed for the pesticide chemical 
residue on the raw agricultural commodity.
    (f) For the purpose of computing fees as required by Sec. 180.33, 
each group of related crops listed in Sec. 180.34(e) and each crop 
group or subgroup listed in Sec. 180.41 is counted as a single raw 
agricultural commodity in a petition or request for tolerances or 
exemption from the requirement of a tolerance.
    (g) Tolerances and exemptions established for pesticide chemicals in 
or on the general category of raw agricultural commodities listed in 
column A apply to the corresponding specific raw agricultural 
commodities listed in column B. However, a tolerance or exemption for a 
specific commodity in column B does not apply to the general category in 
column A.

    (h) Unless otherwise specified in this paragraph or in tolerance 
regulations prescribed in this part for specific pesticide chemicals, 
the raw agricultural commodity or processed food to be examined for 
pesticide residues, shall consist of the whole raw agricultural 
commodity or processed food.
    (1) The raw agricultural commodity bananas, when examined for 
pesticide residues, shall not include any crown tissue or stalk.
    (2) Shell shall be removed and discarded from nuts before 
examination for pesticide residues.
    (3) Caps (hulls) shall be removed and discarded from strawberries 
before examination for pesticide residues.
    (4) Stems shall be removed and discarded from melons before 
examination for pesticide residues.
    (5) Roots, stems, and outer sheaths (or husks) shall be removed and 
discarded from garlic bulbs and dry bulb onions, and only the garlic 
cloves and onion bulbs shall be examined for pesticide residues.
    (6) Where a tolerance is established on a root vegetable including 
tops and/or with tops, and the tops and the roots are marketed together, 
they shall be analyzed separately and neither the pesticide residue on 
the roots nor the pesticide residue on the tops shall exceed the 
tolerance level, except that in the case of carrots, parsnips, and 
rutabagas, the tops shall be removed and discarded before analyzing 
roots for pesticide residues.
    (7) The crowns (leaves at the top of the fruit) shall be removed and 
discarded from pineapples before examination for pesticide residues.
    (8) The term lima beans means the beans and the pod.
    (9) The term peanuts means the peanut meat after removal of the 
hulls.
    (10) For processed foods consisting primarily of one ingredient and 
sold in a form requiring further preparation prior to consumption (e.g., 
fruit juice concentrates, dehydrated vegetables, and powdered potatoes), 
the processed food to be examined for residues shall be the whole 
processed commodity after compensating for or reconstituting to the 
commodity's normal moisture content, unless a tolerance for the 
concentrated or dehydrated food form is included in this part. If there 
exists a tolerance for a specific pesticide on the processed food in its 
concentrated or dehydrated food form, for the purpose of determining 
whether the food is in compliance with that tolerance, the processed 
food to be examined for residues shall be the whole processed commodity 
on an ``as is'' basis.
    (i) The term pesticide chemical shall have the meaning specified in 
FFDCA section 201(q)(1), as amended, except as provided in Sec. 180.4.

[[Page 413]]

    (j) The term negligible residue means any amount of a pesticide 
chemical remaining in or on a raw agricultural commodity or group of raw 
agricultural commodities that would result in a daily intake regarded as 
toxicologically insignificant on the basis of scientific judgment of 
adequate safety data. Ordinarily this will add to the diet an amount 
which will be less than 1/2,000th of the amount that has been 
demonstrated to have no effect from feeding studies on the most 
sensitive animal species tested. Such toxicity studies shall usually 
include at least 90-day feeding studies in two species of mammals.
    (k) The term nonperishable raw agricultural commodity means any raw 
agricultural commodity not subject to rapid decay or deterioration that 
would render it unfit for consumption. Examples are cocoa beans, coffee 
beans, field-dried beans, field-dried peas, grains, and nuts. Not 
included are eggs, milk, meat, poultry, fresh fruits, and vegetables 
such as onions, parsnips, potatoes, and carrots.
    (l) The term tolerance with regional registration means any 
tolerance which is established for pesticide residues resulting from the 
use of the pesticide pursuant to a regional registration. Such a 
tolerance is supported by residue data from specific growing regions for 
a raw agricultural commodity. Individual tolerances with regional 
registration are designated in separate subsections in 40 CFR 180.101 
through 180.999, as appropriate. Additional residue data which are 
representative of the proposed use area are required to expand the 
geographical area of usage of a pesticide on a raw agricultural 
commodity having an established ``tolerance with regional 
registration.'' Persons seeking geographically broader registration of a 
crop having a ``tolerance with regional registration'' should contact 
the appropriate EPA product manager concerning additional residue data 
required to expand the use area.

    (1) Any raw agricultural commodity (food or feed) as defined in 
section 201(r) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA); and
    (2) Any processed food or feed as defined in section 201(gg) of the

<R05>
Sec. 180.3  Tolerances for related pesticide chemicals.

    (a) Pesticide chemicals that cause related pharmacological effects 
will be regarded, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, as having 
an additive deleterious action. (For example, many pesticide chemicals 
within each of the following groups have related pharmacological 
effects: Chlorinated organic pesticides, arsenic-containing chemicals, 
metallic dithiocarbamates, cholinesterase-inhibiting pesticides.)
    (b) Tolerances established for such related pesticide chemicals may 
limit the amount of a common component (such as 
As<INF>2</INF>O<INF>3</INF>) that may be present, or may limit the 
amount of biological activity (such as cholinesterase inhibition) that 
may be present, or may limit the total amount of related pesticide 
chemicals (such as chlorinated organic pesticides) that may be present.
    (c)(1) Where tolerances for inorganic bromide in or on the same raw 
agricultural commodity are set in two or more sections in this part 
(example: Sec. Sec. 180.123 and 180.199), the overall quantity of 
inorganic bromide to be tolerated from use of the same pesticide in 
different modes of application or from two or more pesticide chemicals 
for which tolerances are established is the highest of the separate 
applicable tolerances. For example, where the bromide tolerance on 
asparagus from methyl bromide commodity fumigation is 100 parts per 
million (40 CFR 180.123) and on asparagus from methyl bromide soil 
treatment is 300 parts per million (40 CFR 180.199), the overall 
inorganic bromide tolerance for asparagus grown on methyl bromide-
treated soil and also fumigated with methyl bromide after harvest is 300 
parts per million.

[[Page 414]]

    (2) Where tolerances are established in terms of inorganic bromide 
residues only from use of organic bromide fumigants on raw agricutural 
commodities, such tolerances are sufficient to protect the public 
health, and no additional concurrent tolerances for the organic 
pesticide chemicals from such use are necessary. This conclusion is 
based on evidence of the dissipation of the organic pesticide or its 
conversion to inorganic bromide residues in the food when ready to eat.
    (d)(1) Where tolerances are established for both calcium cyanide and 
hydrogen cyanide on the same raw agricultural commodity, the total 
amount of such pesticides shall not yield more residue than that 
permitted by the larger of the two tolerances, calculated as hydrogen 
cyanide.
    (2) Where tolerances are established for residues of both O,O-
diethyl S-[2-(ethylthio)ethyl] phosphorodithioate and demeton (a mixture 
of O,O-diethyl O-(and S-) [2-(ethylthio)ethyl] phosphorothioates) on the 
same raw agricultural commodity, the total amount of such pesticides 
shall not yield more residue than that permitted by the larger of the 
two tolerances, calculated as demeton.
    (3) Where tolerances are established for both terpene 
polychlorinates (chlorinated mixture of camphene, pinene, and related 
terpenes, containing 65-66 percent chlorine) and toxaphene (chlorinated 
camphene containing 67-69 percent chlorine) on the same raw agricultural 
commodities, the total amount of such pesticides shall not yield more 
residue than that permitted by the larger of the two tolerances, 
calculated as a chlorinated terpene of molecular weight 396.6 containing 
67 percent chlorine.
    (4) Where a tolerance is established for more than one pesticide 
containing arsenic found in, or on a raw agricultural commodity, the 
total amount of such pesticide shall not exceed the highest established 
tolerance calculated as As<INF>2</INF>O<INF>3</INF>.
    (5) Where tolerances are established for more than one member of the 
class of dithiocarbamates listed in paragraph (e)(3) of this section on 
the same raw agricultural commodity, the total residue of such 
pesticides shall not exceed that permitted by the highest tolerance 
established for any one member of the class, calculated as zinc 
ethylenebisdithiocarbamate.
    (6) Where tolerances are established for residues of both S,S,S-
tributyl phosphorotrithioate and tributyl phosphorotrithioite in or on 
the same raw agricultural commodity, the total amount of such pesticides 
shall not yield more residue than that permitted by the higher of the 
two tolerances, calculated as S,S,S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate.
    (7) Where tolerances are established for residues of O,S-dimethyl 
phosphoramidothioate, resulting from the use of acephate (O,S-dimethyl 
acetylphos-phoramidothioate) and/or O,S - dimethylphosphoramidothioate 
on the same agricultural commodity, the total amount of O,S-dimethyl-
phosphoramidothioate shall not yield more residue than that permitted by 
the higher of the two tolerances.
    (8) Where a tolerance is established for more than one pesticide 
having the metabolites 1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-methylurea (DCPMU) and 
3,4-dichlorophenylurea (DCPU) found in or on a raw agricultural 
commodity, the total amount of such residues shall not exceed the 
highest established tolerance for a pesticide having these metabolites.
    (9) Where a tolerance is established for more than one pesticide 
having as metabolites compounds containing the benzimidazole moiety 
found in or on a raw agricultural commodity, the total amount of such 
residues shall not exceed the highest established tolerance for a 
pesticide having these metabolites.
    (10) Where a tolerance is established for triclopyr, chloropyrifos, 
and chlorpyrifos-methyl having the common metabolite 3,5,6-trichloro-2-
pyridinol on the same raw agricultural commodity, the total amount of 
such residues shall not exceed the highest established tolerance for any 
of the pesticides having the metabolites.
    (11) Where tolerances are established for more than one pesticide 
having the metabolite 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol found in or on the raw 
agricultural commodity, the total amount of such residues shall not 
exceed the highest

[[Page 415]]

established tolerance for a pesticide having this metabolite.
    (12) Where tolerances are established for residues of methomyl, 
resulting from the use of thiodicarb and/or methomyl on the same raw 
agricultural commodity, the total amount of methomyl shall not yield 
more residue than that permitted by the higher of the two tolerances.
    (e) Except as noted in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section, 
where residues from two or more chemicals in the same class are present 
in or on a raw agricultural commodity the tolerance for the total of 
such residues shall be the same as that for the chemical having the 
lowest numerical tolerance in this class, unless a higher tolerance 
level is specifically provided for the combined residues by a regulation 
in this part.
    (1) Where residues from two or more chemicals in the same class are 
present in or on a raw agricultural commodity and there are available 
methods that permit quantitative determination of each residue, the 
quantity of combined residues that are within the tolerance may be 
determined as follows:
    (i) Determine the quantity of each residue present.
    (ii) Divide the quantity of each residue by the tolerance that would 
apply if it occurred alone, and multiply by 100 to determine the 
percentage of the permitted amount of residue present.
    (iii) Add the percentages so obtained for all residues present.
    (iv) The sum of the percentages shall not exceed 100 percent.
    (2) Where residues from two or more chemicals in the same class are 
present in or on a raw agricultural commodity and there are available 
methods that permit quantitative determinations of one or more, but not 
all, of the residues, the amounts of such residues as may be 
determinable shall be deducted from the total amount of residues present 
and the remainder shall have the same tolerance as that for the chemical 
having the lowest numerical tolerance in that class. The quantity of 
combined residues that are within the tolerance may be determined as 
follows:
    (i) Determine the quantity of each determinable residue present.
    (ii) Deduct the amounts of such residues from the total amount of 
residues present and consider the remainder to have the same tolerance 
as that for the chemical having the lowest numerical tolerance in that 
class.
    (iii) Divide the quantity of each determinable residue by the 
tolerance that would apply if it occurred alone and the quantity of the 
remaining residue by the tolerance for the chemical having the lowest 
numerical tolerance in that class and multiply by 100 to determine the 
percentage of the permitted amount of residue present.
    (iv) Add the percentages so obtained for all residues present.
    (v) The sum of the percentages shall not exceed 100 percent.
    (3) The following pesticides are members of the class of 
dithiocarbamates:

Sec. 180.4  Exceptions.

    The substances listed in this section are excepted from the 
definitions of ``pesticide chemical'' and ``pesticide chemical residue'' 
under FFDCA section 201(q)(3) and are therefore exempt from regulation 
under FFDCA section 402(a)(2)(B) and 408. These substances are subject 
to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration as food additives 
under FFDCA section 409.
    (a) Inert ingredients in food packaging treated with a pesticide, 
when such inert ingredients are the components of the food packaging 
material (e.g. paper and paperboard, coatings, adhesives, and polymers).
    (b) [Reserved]

<R05>
Sec. 180.5  Zero tolerances.

    A zero tolerance means that no amount of the pesticide chemical may 
remain on the raw agricultural commodity when it is offered for 
shipment. A zero tolerance for a pesticide chemical in or on a raw 
agricultural commodity may be established because, among other reasons:
    (a) A safe level of the pesticide chemical in the diet of two 
different species of warm-blooded animals has not been reliably 
determined.

[[Page 418]]

    (b) The chemical is carcinogenic to or has other alarming 
physiological effects upon one or more of the species of the test 
animals used, when fed in the diet of such animals.
    (c) The pesticide chemical is toxic, but is normally used at times 
when, or in such manner that, fruit, vegetables, or other raw 
agricultural commodities will not bear or contain it.
    (d) All residue of the pesticide chemical is normally removed 
through good agricultural practice such as washing or brushing or 
through weathering or other changes in the chemical itself, prior to 
introduction of the raw agricultural commodity into interstate commerce.


<R05>
Sec. 180.6  Pesticide tolerances regarding milk, eggs, meat, and/or poultry; statement of policy.

    (a) When establishing tolerances for pesticide residues in or on raw 
agricultural commodities, consideration is always given to possible 
residues of those pesticide chemicals or their conversion products 
entering the diet of man through the ingestion of milk, eggs, meat, and/
or poultry produced by animals fed agricultural products bearing such 
pesticide residues. In each instance an evaluation of all available data 
will result in a conclusion either:
    (1) That finite residues will actually be incurred in these foods 
from feed use of the raw agricultural commodity including its 
byproducts; or
    (2) That it is not possible to establish with certainty whether 
finite residues will be incurred, but there is a reasonable expectation 
of finite residues; or
    (3) That it is not possible to establish with certainty whether 
finite residues will be incurred, but there is no reasonable expectation 
of finite residues.
    (b) When the data show that finite residues will actually be 
incurred in milk, eggs, meat, and/or poultry, a tolerance will be 
established on the raw agricultural commodity used as feed provided that 
tolerances can be established at the same time, on the basis of the 
toxicological and other data available, for the finite residues incurred 
in milk, eggs, meat, and/or poultry. When it is not possible to 
determine with certainty whether finite residues will be incurred in 
milk, eggs, meat, and/or poultry but there is a reasonable expectation 
of finite residues in light of data reflecting exaggerated pesticides 
levels in feeding studies, a tolerance will be established on the raw 
agricultural commodity provided that appropriate tolerances can be 
established at the same time, on the basis of the toxicological and 
other data available, for the finite residues likely to be incurred in 
these foods through the feed use of the raw agricultural commodity or 
its byproducts. When it is not possible to determine with certainty 
whether finite residues will be incurred in milk, eggs, meat, and/or 
poultry but there is no reasonable expectation of finite residues in 
light of data such as those reflecting exaggerated pesticide levels in 
feeding studies and those elucidating the biochemistry of the pesticide 
chemical in the animal, a tolerance may be established on the raw 
agricultural commodity without the necessity of a tolerance on food 
products derived from the animal.
    (c) The principles outlined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section will also be followed with respect to tolerances for residues 
which will actually be incurred or are reasonably to be expected in 
milk, eggs, meat, and/or poultry by the use of pesticides directly on 
the animal or administered purposely in the feed or drinking water.
    (d) Tolerances contemplated by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section will in addition to toxicological considerations be conditioned 
on the availability of a practicable analytical method to determine the 
pesticide residue; that is, the method must be sensitive and reliable at 
the tolerance level or in special cases at a higher level where such 
level is deemed satisfactory and safe in light of the toxicity of the 
pesticide residue and of the unlikelihood of such residue exceeding the 
tolerance. The analytical methods to be used for enforcement purposes 
will be those set forth in the ``Pesticide Analytical Manual'' (see 
Sec. 180.101(c)). The sensitivities of these methods are expressed in 
that manual.

determination under FFDCA section 408(b)(2)(C).
    (12) Such information as the Administrator may require on whether 
the pesticide chemical may have an effect in humans that is similar to 
an effect produced by a naturally occurring estrogen or other endocrine 
effects.
    (13) Information regarding exposure to the pesticide chemical 
residue due to any tolerance or exemption already granted for such 
residue.
    (14) Information concerning any maximum residue level established by 
the Codex Alimentarius Commission for the pesticide chemical residue 
addressed in the petition. If a Codex maximum residue level has been 
established for the pesticide chemical residue and the petitioner does 
not propose that this level be adopted, a statement explaining the 
reasons for this departure from the Codex level.
    (15) Such other data and information as the Administrator requires 
by regulation to support the petition.
    (16) Reasonable grounds in support of the petition.
    (c) The data specified under paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(16) of 
this section should be on separate sheets or sets of sheets, suitably 
identified. If such data have already been submitted

[[Page 420]]

with an earlier application, the present petition may incorporate it by 
reference to the earlier one.
    (d) Except as noted in paragraph (e) of this section, a petition 
shall not be accepted for filing if any of the data prescribed by FFDCA 
section 408(d) are lacking or are not set forth so as to be readily 
understood. The availability to the public of information provided to, 
or otherwise obtained by, the Agency under this part shall be governed 
by part 2 of this chapter. The Administrator shall make the full text of 
the summary referenced in paragraph (b)(1) of this section available to 
the public in the public docket at http://www.regulations.gov no later 
than publication in the Federal Register of the notice of the petition 
filing.
    (e) The Administrator shall notify the petitioner within 15 days 
after its receipt of acceptance or nonacceptance of a petition, and if 
not accepted the reasons therefor. If petitioner desires, the petitioner 
may supplement a deficient petition after notification as to 
deficiencies. If the petitioner does not wish to supplement or explain 
the petition and requests in writing that it be filed as submitted, the 
petition shall be filed and the petitioner so notified.
    (f) A notice of the filing of a petition for a pesticide chemical 
residue tolerance that the Administrator determines has met the 
requirements of paragraph (b) of this section shall be published in the 
Federal Register by the Administrator within 30 days after such 
determination. The notice shall state the name of the pesticide chemical 
residue and the commodities for which a tolerance is sought and announce 
the availability of a description of the analytical methods available to 
the Administrator for the detection and measurement of the pesticide 
chemical residue with respect to which the petition is filed or shall 
set forth the petitioner's statement of why such a method is not needed. 
The notice shall explicitly reference the specific docket identification 
number in the public docket at http://www.regulations.gov where the full 
text of the summary required in paragraph (b) of this section is 
located, and refer interested parties to this document for further 
information on the petition. The full text of the summary may be omitted 
from the notice.
    (g) The Administrator may request a sample of the pesticide chemical 
at any time while a petition is under consideration. The Administrator 
shall specify in its request for a sample of the pesticide chemical, a 
quantity which it deems adequate to permit tests of analytical methods 
used to determine residues of the pesticide chemical and of methods 
proposed by the petitioner for removing any residues of the chemical 
that exceed the tolerance proposed.
    (h) The Administrator shall determine, in accordance with the Act, 
whether to issue an order that establishes, modifies, or revokes a 
tolerance regulation (whether or not in accord with the action proposed 
by the petitioner), whether to publish a proposed tolerance regulation 
and request public comment thereon under Sec. 180.29, or whether to 
deny the petition. The Administrator shall publish in the Federal 
Register such order or proposed regulation. After receiving comments on 
any proposed regulation, the Administrator may issue an order that 
establishes, modifies, or revokes a tolerance regulation. An order 
published under this section shall describe briefly how to submit 
objections and requests for a hearing under part 178 of this chapter. A 
regulation issued under this section shall be effective on the date of 
publication in the Federal Register unless otherwise provided in the 
regulation.

Sec. 180.8  Withdrawal of petitions without prejudice.

    In some cases the Administrator will notify the petitioner that the 
petition, while technically complete, is inadequate to justify the 
establishment of a tolerance or the tolerance requested by petitioner. 
This may be due to the fact that the data are not sufficiently clear or 
complete. In such cases, the petitioner may withdraw the petition 
pending its clarification or the obtaining of additional data. This 
withdrawal may be without prejudice to a future filing. A deposit for 
fees as specified in Sec. 180.33

[[Page 421]]

shall accompany the resubmission of the petition.

Sec. 180.29  Establishment, modification, and revocation of tolerance on initiative of Administrator.

    (a) Upon the Administrator's own initiative, the Administrator may 
propose, under FFDCA section 408(e), the issuance of a regulation 
establishing a tolerance for a pesticide chemical or exempting it from 
the necessity of a tolerance, or a regulation modifying or revoking an 
existing tolerance or exemption.
    (b) The Administrator shall provide a period of not less than 60 
days for persons to comment on the proposed regulation, except that a 
shorter period for comment may be provided if the Administrator for good 
cause finds that it would be in the public interest to do so and states 
the reasons for the finding in the notice of proposed rulemaking.
    (c) After reviewing any timely comments received, the Administrator 
may by order establish, modify, or revoke a tolerance regulation, which 
order and regulation shall be published in the Federal Register. An 
order published under this section shall state that persons may submit 
objections and requests for a hearing in the manner described in part 
178 of this chapter.
    (d) Any final regulation issued under this section shall be 
effective on the date of publication in the Federal Register unless 
otherwise provided in the regulation.

Sec. 180.30  Judicial review.

    (a) Under FFDCA section 408(h), judicial review is available in the 
United States Courts of Appeal as to the following actions:
    (1) Regulations establishing general procedures and requirements 
under FFDCA section 408(e)(1)(C).
    (2) Orders issued under FFDCA section 408(f)(1)(C) requiring the 
submission of data.
    (3) Orders issued under FFDCA section 408(g)(2)(C) ruling on 
objections to establishment, modification, or revocation of a tolerance 
or exemption under FFDCA section 408(d)(4), or any regulation that is 
the subject of such an order. The underlying action here is Agency 
disposition of a petition seeking the establishment, modification, or 
revocation of a tolerance or exemption.
    (4) Orders issued under FFDCA section 408(g)(2)(C) ruling on 
objections to the denial of a petition under FFDCA section 408(d)(4).
    (5) Orders issued under FFDCA section 408(g)(2)(C) ruling on 
objections to the establishment, modification, suspension, or revocation 
of a tolerance or exemption under FFDCA section 408(e)(1)(A) or 
(e)(1)(B). The underlying action here is the establishment, 
modification, suspension, or revocation of a tolerance or exemption upon 
the initiative of EPA including EPA actions pursuant to FFDCA sections 
408(b)(2)(B)(v), 408(b)(2)(E)(ii), 408(d)(4)(C)(ii), 408(l)(4), and 
408(q)(1).
    (6) Orders issued under FFDCA section 408(g)(2)(C) ruling on 
objections to the revocation or modification of a tolerance or exemption 
under FFDCA section 408(f)(2) for noncompliance with requirements for 
the submission of data.
    (7) Orders issued under FFDCA section 408(g)(2)(C) ruling on 
objections to rules issued under FFDCA sections 408(n)(3) and 408(d) or 
(e) regarding determinations pertaining to State authority to establish 
regulatory limits on pesticide chemical residues.
    (8) Orders issued under FFDCA section 408(g)(2)(C) ruling on 
objections to orders issued under FFDCA section 408(n)(5)(C) authorizing 
States to establish regulatory limits not identical to certain 
tolerances or exemptions.
    (b) Any issue as to which review is or was obtainable under 
paragraph (a) of this section shall not be the subject of judicial 
review under any other provision of law. In part, this means that, for 
the Agency actions subject to the

[[Page 422]]

objection procedure in FFDCA section 408(g)(2), judicial review is not 
available unless an adversely affected party exhausts these objection 
procedures, and any petition procedures preliminary thereto.

Sec. 180.31  Temporary tolerances.

    (a) A temporary tolerance (or exemption from a tolerance) 
established under the authority of FFDCA section 408(r) shall be deemed 
to be a tolerance (or exemption from the requirement of a tolerance) for 
the purposes of FFDCA section 408(a)(1) or (a)(2) and for the purposes 
of Sec. 180.30.
    (b) A request for a temporary tolerance or a temporary exemption 
from a tolerance by a person who has obtained or is seeking an 
experimental permit for a pesticide chemical under the Federal 
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act shall be accompanied by such 
data as are available on subjects outlined in Sec. 180.7(b) and an 
advance deposit to cover fees as provided in Sec. 180.33.
    (c) To obtain a temporary tolerance, a requestor must comply with 
the petition procedures specified in FFDCA section 408(d) and Sec. 
180.7 except as provided in this section.
    (d) A temporary tolerance or exemption from a tolerance may be 
issued for a period designed to allow the orderly marketing of the raw 
agricultural commodities produced while testing a pesticide chemical 
under an experimental permit issued under authority of the Federal 
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act if the Administrator 
concludes that the safety standard in FFDCA section 408(b)(2) or (c), as 
applicable, is met. Subject to the requirements of FFDCA section 408(e), 
a temporary tolerance or exemption from a tolerance may be revoked if 
the experimental permit is revoked, or may be revoked at any time if it 
develops that the application for a temporary tolerance contains a 
misstatement of a material fact or that new scientific data or 
experience with the pesticide chemical indicates that it does not meet 
the safety standard in FFDCA section 408(b)(2) or (c), as applicable.
    (e) Conditions under which a temporary tolerance is established 
shall include:
    (1) A limitation on the amount of the chemical to be used on the 
designated crops permitted under the experimental permit.
    (2) A limitation for the use of the chemical on the designated crops 
to bona fide experimental use by qualified persons as indicated in the 
experimental permit.
    (3) A requirement that the person or firm which obtains the 
experimental permit for which the temporary tolerance is established 
will immediately inform the Environmental Protection Agency of any 
reports on findings from the experimental use that have a bearing on 
safety.
    (4) A requirement that the person or firm which obtained the 
experimental permit for which the temporary tolerance is established 
will keep records of production, distribution, and performance for a 
period of 2 years and, on request, at any reasonable time, make these 
records available to any authorized officer or employee of the 
Environmental Protection Agency.

Sec. 180.32  Procedure for modifying and revoking tolerances or exemptions from tolerances.

    (a) The Administrator on his/her own initiative may propose the 
issuance of a regulation modifying or revoking a tolerance for a 
pesticide chemical residue on raw agricultural commodities or processed 
foods or modifying or revoking an exemption from tolerance for such 
residue.
    (b) Any person may file with the Administrator a petition proposing 
the issuance of a regulation modifying or revoking a tolerance or 
exemption from a tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue. The 
petition shall furnish reasonable grounds for the action sought. 
Reasonable grounds shall include an explanation showing wherein the 
person has a substantial interest in such tolerance or exemption from 
tolerance and an assertion of facts (supported by data if available) 
showing that new uses for the pesticide chemical have been developed or 
old uses abandoned, that new data are available

[[Page 423]]

as to toxicity of the chemical, or that experience with the application 
of the tolerance or exemption from tolerance may justify its 
modification or revocation. Evidence that a person has registered or has 
submitted an application for the registration of a pesticide under the 
Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act will be regarded as 
evidence that the person has a substantial interest in a tolerance or 
exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for a pesticide chemical 
that consists in whole or in part of the pesticide. New data should be 
furnished in the form specified in Sec. 180.7(b) for submitting 
petitions, as applicable.
    (c) The procedures for completing action on an Administrator 
initiated proposal or a petition shall be those specified in Sec. Sec. 
180.29 and 180.7, as applicable.

Sec. 180.33  Fees.

    (a) Each petition for the establishment of a new tolerance or a 
tolerance higher than already established, shall be accompanied by a fee 
of $80,950, plus $2,025 for each raw agricultural commodity more than 
nine on which the establishment of a tolerance is requested, except as 
provided in paragraphs (b), (d), and (h) of this section.
    (b) Each petition for the establishment of a tolerance at a lower 
numerical level or levels than a tolerance already established for the 
same pesticide chemical, or for the establishment of a tolerance on 
additional raw agricultural commodities at the same numerical level as a 
tolerance already established for the same pesticide chemical, shall be 
accompanied by a fee of $18,500 plus $1,225 for each raw agricultural 
commodity on which a tolerance is requested.
    (c) Each petition for an exemption from the requirement of a 
tolerance or repeal of an exemption shall be accompanied by a fee of 
$14,925.
    (d) Each petition or request for a temporary tolerance or a 
temporary exemption from the requirement of a tolerance shall be 
accompanied by a fee of $32,325 except as provided in paragraph (e) of 
this section. A petition or request to renew or extend such temporary 
tolerance or temporary exemption shall be accompanied by a fee of 
$4,600.
    (e) A petition or request for a temporary tolerance for a pesticide 
chemical which has a tolerance for other uses at the same numerical 
level or a higher numerical level shall be accompanied by a fee of 
$16,075, plus $1,225 for each raw agricultural commodity on which the 
temporary tolerance is sought.
    (f) Each petition for revocation of a tolerance shall be accompanied 
by a fee of $10,125. Such fee is not required when, in connection with 
the change sought under this paragraph, a petition is filed for the 
establishment of new tolerances to take the place of those sought to be 
revoked and a fee is paid as required by paragraph (a) of this section.
    (g) If a petition or a request is not accepted for processing 
because it is technically incomplete, the fee, less $2,025 for handling 
and initial review, shall be returned. If a petition is withdrawn by the 
petitioner after initial processing, but before significant Agency 
scientific review has begun, the fee, less $2,025 for handling and 
initial review, shall be returned. If an unacceptable or withdrawn 
petition is resubmitted, it shall be accompanied by the fee that would 
be required if it were being submitted for the first time.
    (h) Each petition for a crop group tolerance, regardless of the 
number of raw agricultural commodities involved, shall be accompanied by 
a fee equal to the fee required by the analogous category for a single 
tolerance that is not a crop group tolerance, i.e., paragraphs (a) 
through (f) of this section, without a charge for each commodity where 
that would otherwise apply.
    (i) Objections under section 408(d)(5) of the Act shall be 
accompanied by a filing fee of $4,050.
    (j) The person who files a petition for judicial review of an order 
under section 408(h) of the Act shall pay the costs of preparing the 
record on which the order is based unless the person has no financial 
interest in the petition for judicial review.
    (k) No fee under this section will be imposed on the Interregional 
Research Project Number 4 (IR-4 Program).

[[Page 424]]

    (l) The Administrator may waive or refund part or all of any fee 
imposed by this section if the Administrator determines in his or her 
sole discretion that such a waiver or refund will promote the public 
interest or that payment of the fee would work an unreasonable hardship 
on the person on whom the fee is imposed. A request for waiver or refund 
of a fee shall be submitted to the Office of Pesticide Programs' 
Document Processing Desk at the appropriate address as set forth in 40 
CFR 150.17(a) or (b). A fee of $2,025 shall accompany every request for 
a waiver or refund, as specified in paragraph (m) of this section, 
except that the fee under this paragraph shall not be imposed on any 
person who has no financial interest in any action requested by such 
person under paragraphs (a) through (j) of this section. The fee for 
requesting a waiver or refund shall be refunded if the request is 
granted.
    (m) All deposits and fees required by the regulations in this part 
shall be paid by money order, bank draft, or certified check drawn to 
the order of the Environmental Protection Agency. All deposits and fees 
shall be forwarded to the Environmental Protection Agency, Headquarters 
Accounting Operations Branch, Office of Pesticide Programs (Tolerance 
Fees), P.O. Box 360277M, Pittsburgh, PA 15251. The payments should be 
specifically labeled ``Tolerance Petition Fees'' and should be 
accompanied only by a copy of the letter or petition requesting the 
tolerance. The actual letter or petition, along with supporting data, 
shall be forwarded within 30 days of payment to the Office of Pesticide 
Programs' Document Processing Desk at the appropriate address as set 
forth in 40 CFR 150.17(a) or (b). A petition will not be accepted for 
processing until the required fees have been submitted. A petition for 
which a waiver of fees has been requested will not be accepted for 
processing until the fee has been waived or, if the waiver has been 
denied, the proper fee is submitted after notice of denial. A request 
for waiver or refund will not be accepted after scientific review has 
begun on a petition.
    (n) This fee schedule will be changed annually by the same 
percentage as the percent change in the Federal General Schedule (GS) 
pay scale. In addition, processing costs and fees will periodically be 
reviewed and changes will be made to the schedule as necessary. When 
automatic adjustments are made based on the GS pay scale, the new fee 
schedule will be published in the Federal Register as a final rule to 
become effective 30 days or more after publication, as specified in the 
rule. When changes are made based on periodic reviews, the changes will 
be subject to public comment.
    (o) No fee required by this section shall be levied during the 
period beginning on October 1, 2003, and ending September 30, 2008.

Sec. 180.34  Tests on the amount of residue remaining.

    (a) Data in a petition on the amount of residue remaining in or on a 
raw agricultural commodity should establish the residue that may remain 
when the pesticide chemical is applied according to directions 
registered under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide 
Act, or according to directions contained in an application for 
registration. These data should establish the residues that may remain 
under conditions most likely to result in high residues on the 
commodity.
    (b) The petition should establish the reliability of the residue 
data reported in it. Sufficient information should be submitted about 
the analytical method to permit competent analysts to apply it 
successfully.
    (c) If the pesticide chemical is absorbed into a living plant or 
animal when applied (is systemic), residue data may be needed on each 
plant or animal on which a tolerance or exemption is requested.
    (d) If the pesticide chemical is not absorbed into the living plant 
or animal when applied (is not systemic), it may be possible to make a 
reliable estimate of the residues to be expected on each commodity in a 
group of related commodities on the basis of less data than would be 
required for each commodity in the group, considered separately.

Sec. 180.35  Tests for potentiation.

    Experiments have shown that certain cholinesterase-inhibiting 
pesticides when fed together to test animals are more toxic than the sum 
of their individual toxicities when fed separately. One substance 
potentiates the toxicity of the other. Important toxicological 
interactions also have been observed between pesticides and other 
substances. Wherever there is reason to believe that a pesticide 
chemical for which a tolerance is proposed may interact with other 
pesticide chemicals or other substances to which man is exposed, it may 
be necessary to require special experimental data regarding potentiation 
capacities to evaluate the safety of the proposed tolerance. This 
necessarily will be determined on a case-by-case basis.


<R05>
Sec. 180.40  Tolerances for crop groups.

    (a) Group or subgroup tolerances may be established as a result of:
    (1) A petition from a person who has submitted an application for 
the registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide, 
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.
    (2) On the initiative of the Administrator.
    (3) A petition by an interested person.
    (b) The tables in Sec. 180.41 are to be used in conjunction with 
this section for the establishment of crop group tolerances. Each table 
in Sec. 180.41 lists a group of raw agricultural commodities that are 
considered to be related for the purposes of this section. Refer also to 
Sec. 180.1(g) for a listing of commodities for which established 
tolerances may be applied to certain other related and similar 
commodities.
    (c) When there is an established or proposed tolerance for all of 
the representative commodities for a specific

[[Page 426]]

group or subgroup of related commodities, a tolerance may be established 
for all commodities in the associated group or subgroup. Tolerances may 
be established for a crop group or, alternatively, tolerances may be 
established for one or more of the subgroups of a crop group.
    (d) The representative crops are given as an indication of the 
minimum residue chemistry data base acceptable to the Agency for the 
purposes of establishing a group tolerance. The Agency may, at its 
discretion, allow group tolerances when data on suitable substitutes for 
the representative crops are available (e.g., limes instead of lemons).
    (e) Since a group tolerance reflects maximum residues likely to 
occur on all individual crops within a group, the proposed or registered 
patterns of use for all crops in the group or subgroup must be similar 
before a group tolerance is established. The pattern of use consists of 
the amount of pesticide applied, the number of times applied, the timing 
of the first application, the interval between applications, and the 
interval between the last application and harvest. The pattern of use 
will also include the type of application; for example, soil or foliar 
application, or application by ground or aerial equipment.
    (f) When the crop grouping contains commodities or byproducts that 
are utilized for animal feed, any needed tolerance or exemption from a 
tolerance for the pesticide in meat, milk, poultry and/or eggs must be 
established before a tolerance will be granted for the group as a whole. 
The representative crops include all crops in the group that could be 
processed such that residues may concentrate in processed food and/or 
feed. Processing data will be required prior to establishment of a group 
tolerance. Tolerances will not be granted on a group basis as to 
processed foods prepared from crops covered by the group tolerance.
    (g) If maximum residues (tolerances) for the representative crops 
vary by more than a factor of 5 from the maximum value observed for any 
crop in the group, a group or subgroup tolerance will ordinarily not be 
established. In this case individual crop tolerances, rather than group 
tolerances, will normally be established.
    (h) Alternatively, a commodity with a residue level significantly 
higher or lower than the other commodities in a group may be excluded 
from the group tolerance (e.g., cereal grains, except corn). In this 
case an individual tolerance at the appropriate level for the unique 
commodity would be established, if necessary. The alternative approach 
of excluding a commodity with a significantly higher or lower residue 
level will not be used to establish a tolerance for a commodity 
subgroup. Most subgroups have only two representative commodities; to 
exclude one such commodity and its related residue data would likely 
provide insufficient residue information to support the remainder of the 
subgroup. Residue data from crops additional to those representative 
crops in a grouping may be required for systemic pesticides.
    (i) The commodities included in the groups will be updated 
periodically either at the initiative of the Agency or at the request of

contact the Registration Division of the Office of Pesticide Programs.
    (j) When EPA amends a crop group in a manner that expands or 
contracts the commodities that are covered by the group, EPA will 
initially retain the pre-existing as well as the revised crop group in 
the CFR. The revised crop group will have the same number as the pre-
existing crop group; however, the revised crop group number will be 
followed by a hyphen and the final two digits of the year in which it 
was established (e.g., if Crop Group 1 is amended in 2007, the revised 
group will be designated as Crop Group 1-07). If the pre-existing crop 
group had crop subgroups, these subgroups will be numbered in a similar 
fashion in the revised crop group. The name of the revised crop group 
will not be changed from the pre-existing crop group unless the revision 
so changes the composition of the crop group that the pre-existing name 
is no longer accurate. Once a revised crop group is established, EPA 
will no longer establish tolerances under the pre-existing crop group. 
At

[[Page 427]]

appropriate times, EPA will amend tolerances for crop groups that have 
been superseded by revised crop groups to conform the pre-existing crop 
group to the revised crop group. Once all of the tolerances for the pre-
existing crop group have been updated, the pre-existing crop group will 
be removed from the CFR.
    (k) Establishment of a tolerance does not substitute for the 
additional need to register the pesticide under a companion law, the 
Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. The Registration 
Division of the Office of Pesticide Programs should be contacted 
concerning procedures for registration of new uses of a pesticide.

Sec. 180.41  Crop group tables.

    (a) The tables in this section are to be used in conjunction with 
Sec. 180.40 to establish crop group tolerances.
    (b) Commodities not listed are not considered as included in the 
groups for the purposes of this paragraph, and individual tolerances 
must be established. Miscellaneous commodities intentionally not 
included in any group include asparagus, avocado, banana, fig, globe 
artichoke, hops, mango, papaya, pawpaw, peanut, persimmon, pineapple, 
water chestnut, and watercress.
    (c) Each group is identified by a group name and consists of a list 
of representative commodities followed by a list of all commodity 
members for the group. If the group includes subgroups, each subgroup 
lists the subgroup name, the representative commodity or commodities, 
and the member commodities for the subgroup. Subgroups, which are a 
subset of their associated crop group, are established for some but not 
all crops groups.
    (1) Crop Group 1: Root and Tuber Vegetables Group.
    (i) Representative commodities. Carrot, potato, radish, and sugar 
beet.
    (ii) Table. The following table 1 lists all the commodities included 
in Crop Group 1 and identifies the related crop subgroups.

Sec. 180.101  Specific tolerances; general provisions.

    (a) The tolerances established for pesticide chemicals in this 
subpart C apply to residues resulting from their application prior to 
harvest or slaughter, unless otherwise stated. Tolerances are expressed 
in terms of parts by weight of the pesticide chemical per one million 
parts by weight of the raw agricultural commodity.
    (b) The poisonous and deleterious substances for which tolerances 
are established by the regulations in this subpart C are named by their 
common names wherever practicable, otherwise by their chemical names.
    (c) The analytical methods to be used for determining whether 
pesticide residues, including negligible residues, in or on raw 
agricultural commodities are in compliance with the tolerances 
established in this part 180 are identified among the methods contained 
or referenced in the Food and Drug Administration's ``Pesticide 
Analytical Manual'' which is available from the Food and Drug 
Administration, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 200 C

    (2) Inorganic bromide may be present as a residue in certain 
processed food in accordance with the following conditions:
    (i) When inorganic bromide residues are present as a result of 
fumigation of the processed food with methyl bromide or from such 
fumigation in addition to the authorized use of methyl bromide on the 
source raw agricultural commodity, as provided for in this part, the 
total residues of inorganic bromides (calculated as Br) shall not exceed 
the following levels:
    (A) 400 parts per million in or on egg, dried and herb, processed 
and spice.
    (B) 325 parts per million in or on cheese, parmesan and cheese, 
roquefort cheese.
    (C) 250 parts per million in or on tomato, concentrated products and 
fig, dried fruit.
    (D) 125 parts per million in or on processed food other than those 
listed above.
    (ii) When inorganic bromide residues are present in malt beverage, 
fermented in accordance with 21 CFR 172.730(a)(2), the amount shall not 
exceed 25 parts per million (calculated as Br).
    (iii) Where tolerances are established on both the raw agricultural 
commodities and processed food made therefrom, the total residues of 
inorganic bromides in or on the processed food shall not be greater than 
those designated in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, unless a higher 
level is established elsewhere in this part.
    (3) Tolerances are established for residues of inorganic bromides 
(calculated as Br) as follows:
    (i) 400 parts per million for residues in or on dog food, resulting 
from fumigation with methyl bromide.
    (ii) 125 parts per million for residues in or on processed 
commodities for animal feedstuffs from barley, corn, grain sorghum, oat, 
rice, rye and wheat, resulting directly from fumigation with methyl 
bromide or from carryover and concentration of residues of inorganic 
bromides from fumigation of the grains with methyl bromide.
    (b) Section 18 emergency exemptions. [Reserved]
    (c) Tolerances with regional registrations. A tolerance with 
regional registration, as defined in Sec. 180.1(l), is established for 
residues of inorganic bromides (calculated as Br) in or on the following 
food commodity grown in soil fumigated with methyl bromide.

Sec. 180.123a  Inorganic bromide residues in peanut hay and peanut hulls;

statement of policy.

    (a) Investigations by the Food and Drug Administration show that 
peanut hay and peanut shells have been used as feed for meat and dairy 
animals. While many growers now harvest peanuts with combines and leave 
the hay on the ground to be incorporated into the soil, some growers 
follow the practice of curing peanuts on the vines in a stack and save 
the hay for animal feed. Peanut shells or hulls have been used to a 
minor extent as roughage for cattle feed. It has been established that 
the feeding to cattle of peanut hay and peanut hulls containing residues 
of inorganic bromides will contribute considerable residues of inorganic 
bromides to the meat and milk.
    (b) There are no tolerances for inorganic bromides in meat and milk 
to cover residues from use of such peanut hulls as animal feed. Peanut 
hulls containing residues of inorganic bromides from the use of methyl 
bromide are unsuitable as an ingredient in the feed of meat and dairy 
animals and should not be represented, sold, or used for that purpose.

following prescribed conditions:
    (i) It is used or intended for use in combination with pyrethrins 
for control of insects:
    (A) In cereal grain mills and in storage areas for milled cereal 
grain products, whereby the amount of piperonyl butoxide is at least 
equal to but not more than 10 times the amount of pyrethrins in the 
formulation.
    (B) On the outer ply of multiwall paper bags of 50 pounds or more 
capacity in amounts not exceeding 60 milligrams per square foot, whereby 
the amount of piperonyl butoxide is equal to 10 times the amount of 
pyrethrins in the formulation. Such treated bags are to be used only for 
food, dried.
    (C) On cotton bags of 50 pounds or more capacity in amounts not 
exceeding 55 milligrams per square foot of cloth, whereby the amount of 
piperonyl butoxide is equal to 10 times the amount of pyrethrins in the 
formulation. Such treated bags are constructed with waxed paper liners 
and are to be used only for food, dried that contain 4 percent fat or 
less.
    (D) In two-ply bags consisting of cellophane/polyolefin sheets bound 
together by an adhesive layer when it is incorporated in the adhesive. 
The treated sheets shall contain not more than 50 milligrams of 
piperonyl butoxide per square foot (538 milligrams per square meter). 
Such treated bags are to be used only for packaging plum, prune, dried; 
grape, raisin; and other fruit, dried and are to have a maximum ratio of 
3.12 milligrams of piperonyl butoxide per ounce of fruit (0.10 milligram 
of piperonyl butoxide per gram of product).
    (E) In food processing and food storage areas: Provided, That the 
food is removed or covered prior to such use.
    (ii) It is used or intended for use in combination with pyrethrins 
and N-octylbicycloheptene dicarboximide for insect control in accordance 
with 21 CFR 178.3730.

a result of migration from its use on the cloth of cotton bags of 50 
pounds or more capacity constructed with waxed paper liners.
    (E) Food treated in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(i)(D) and (E) 
of this section.
    (iv) To assure safe use of the pesticide, its label and labeling 
shall conform to that registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency, and it shall be used in accordance with such label and labeling.
    (v) Where tolerances are established on both raw agricultural 
commodities and processed food made therefrom, the total residues of 
piperonyl butoxide in or on the processed food shall not be greater than 
that permitted by the larger of the two tolerances.
    (3) Piperonyl butoxide may be safely used in accordance with the 
following prescribed conditions:
    (i) It is used or intended for use in combination with pyrethrins 
for control of insects:

    (2) Chlorpyrifos [O,O-diethyl O-(3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyl) 
phosphorothioate] may be safely used in accordance with the following 
prescribed conditions.
    (i) Application shall be limited solely to spot and/or crack and 
crevice treatment in food handling establishments where food and food 
products are held, processed, prepared or served. Contamination of food 
or food contact surfaces shall be avoided. Food must be removed or 
covered during treatment.
    (ii) Spray concentration for spot treatment shall be limited to a 
maximum of 0.5 percent of the active ingredient by weight. A course, 
low-pressure spray shall be used to avoid atomization or splashing of 
the spray.
    (iii) Paint-on application for spot treatment shall be limited to a 
maximum of 2 percent of the active ingredient by weight.
    (iv) Crack and crevice treatment shall be limited to a maximum of 2 
percent of the active ingredient by weight. Equipment capable of 
delivering a pin-stream of insecticide shall be used.
    (v) Application via adhesive strips shall contain a maximum of 10% 
by weight of the controlled-release product in food-handling 
establishments where food and food products are held, processed, 
prepared, or served. A maximum of 36 strips (or 5.15 grams of 
chlorpyrifos) is to be used per 100 square feet of floor space. The 
strips are not to be placed in exposed areas where direct contact with 
food, utensils, and food-contact surfaces would be likely to occur.
    (vi) To assure safe use of the insecticide, its label and labeling 
shall conform to that registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency, and it shall be used in accordance with such label and labeling.
    (3) A tolerance of 0.1 part per million is established for residues 
of chlorpyrifos, per se, in or on food commodities (other than those 
already covered by a higher tolerance as a result of use on growing 
crops) in food service establishments where food and food products are 
prepared and served, as a result of the application of chlorpyrifos in 
microencapsulated form.
    (i) Application of a microencapsulated product shall be limited 
solely to spot and/or crack and crevice treatment in food handling 
establishments where food and food products are prepared and served. All 
treatments shall be applied in such a manner as to avoid contamination 
of food or food contact surfaces.
    (ii) Spray concentrations shall be limited to a maximum of 0.5 
percent of the active ingredient by weight.
    (iii) For crack and crevice treatment, equipment capable of 
delivering a pin stream of spray directly into cracks and crevices or 
capable of applying

[[Page 505]]

small amounts of insecticide into cracks and crevices shall be used.
    (iv) For spot treatment, an individual spot shall not exceed 2 
square feet.
    (v) To assure safe use of the insecticide, its label and labeling 
shall conform to that registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency, and it shall be used in accordance with such label and labeling.

    (2) Tolerances are established for residues of glyphosate, including 
its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities listed below 
resulting from the application of glyphosate, the isopropylamine salt of 
glyphosate, the ethanolamine salt of glyphosate, the dimethylamine salt 
of glyphosate, the ammonium salt of glyphosate, and the potassium salt 
of glyphosate. Compliance with the following tolerance levels is to be 
determined by measuring only glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine) and 
its metabolite N-acetyl-glyphosate (N-acetyl-N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine; 
calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of glyphosate).

    (2) A tolerance of 0.05 ppm is established for residues of the 
insecticide cyfluthrin (cyano(4-fluoro-3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl-3-(2,2-
dichloroethenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate; CAS Reg. No. 
69359-37-5) in food commodities exposed to the insecticide during 
treatment of food-handling establishments where food and food products 
are held, processed, prepared, or served. Treatments may be made by 
general surface, spot, and/or crack and crevice applications.
    (i) General surface treatments shall be limited to a maximum of 3.8 
grams of active ingredient per 1,000 square feet, applying to walls, 
floors, and ceilings with a low-pressure system. Cover or remove all 
food processing and/or handling equipment during application. Do not 
apply directly to food products. Reapplications may be made at 10-day 
intervals.
    (ii) Crack and crevice or spot treatments shall be limited to a 
maximum of 0.1 percent of the active ingredient weight, applied with a 
low-pressure system with a pinpoint or variable-pattern nozzle. Dust 
formulation shall be limited to a maximum of 0.1 percent of the active 
ingredient by weight, applied using a hand duster, power duster, or 
other equipment capable of applying dust insecticide directly into voids 
and cracks and crevices. Dust applications should be made in a manner to 
avoid deposits on exposed surfaces or introducing the material into the 
air. Cover exposed food or remove food from premises. Do not apply 
directly to food. Reapplications may be made at 10-day intervals.
    (iii) To ensure safe use of the insecticide, its label and labeling 
shall conform to that registered by the Environmental Protection Agency,

    (2) A tolerance of 0.10 parts per million is established for all 
food commodities as a result of the proposed use of NYLAR in food 
handling establishments where food and food products are held, prepared, 
processed or served. Application is limited to space, general surface, 
spot, and/or crack and crevice treatment in food handling establishments 
where food and food products are held, processed, prepared and served. 
Space and general surface application may be used only when the facility 
is not in operation provided exposed food is covered or removed from the 
area being treated prior to application. Spot, and/or crack and crevice 
treatment may be used while the facility is in operation provided 
exposed food is covered or removed from the area being treated prior to 
application. Food contact surfaces should be thoroughly washed with an 
effective cleaning compound and rinced with potable water after use of 
the product. To assure safe use of this additive, its label and labeling 
shall conform to that registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency, and shall be used in accordance with such label and labeling.

<R05>
Sec. 180.1011  Viable spores of the microorganism Bacillus thuringiensis

Berliner; exemption from the requirement of a tolerance.

    (a) For the purposes of this section the microbial insecticide for 
which exemption from the requirement of a tolerance is being established 
shall have the following specifications:
    (1) The microorganism shall be an authentic strain of Bacillus 
thuringiensis Berliner conforming to the morphological and biochemical 
characteristics of Bacillus thuringiensis as described in Bergey's 
Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, Eighth Edition.
    (2) Spore preparations of Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner shall be 
produced by pure culture fermentation procedures with adequate control 
measures during production to detect any changes from the 
characteristics of the parent strain or contamination by other 
microorganisms.
    (3) Each lot of spore preparation, prior to the addition of other 
materials, shall be tested by subcutaneous injection of at least 1 
million spores into each of five laboratory test mice weighing 17 grams 
to 23 grams. Such test shall show no evidence of infection or injury in 
the test animals when observed for 7 days following injection.
    (4) Spore preparations shall be free of the Bacillus thuringiensis 
[beta]-exotoxin when tested with the fly larvae toxicity test 
(``Microbial Control of Insects and Mites,'' R.P.M. Bond et al., p. 280 
ff., 1971). This specification can be satisfied either by determining 
that each master seed lot brought into production is a Bacillus 
thuringiensis strain which does not produce [beta]-exotoxin under 
standard manufacturing conditions or by periodically determining that 
[beta]-exotoxin synthesized during spore production is eliminated by the 
subsequent spore-harvesting procedure.
    (b) Exemption from the requirement of a tolerance is established for 
residues of the microbial insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner, 
as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, in or on honey and 
honeycomb and all other raw agricultural commodities when it is applied 
either to growing crops, or when it is applied after harvest in 
accordance with good agricultural practices.

    (a) Diatomaceous earth is exempted from the requirement of a 
tolerance for residues when used in accordance with good agricultural 
practice in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops, to food 
commodities after harvest, and to animals.
    (b) Diatomaceous earth may be safely used in accordance with the 
following conditions. Application shall be limited solely to spot and/or 
crack and crevice treatments in food or feed processing and food or feed 
storage areas in accordane with the precribed conditions:
    (1) It is used or intended for use for control of insects in food or 
feed processing and food or feed storage areas: Provided, That the food 
or feed is removed or covered prior to such use.
    (2) To assure safe use of the insecticide, its label and labeling 
shall conform to that registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency, and it shall be used in accordance with such label and labeling.

tolerance when used in accordance with good agricultural practice when 
used as a herbicide in the production of garlic and onions, and as a 
potato vine dessicant in the production of potatoes.
    (b) Residues of sulfuric acid are exempted from the requirement of a 
tolerance in cattle, meat; goat, meat; hog, meat; horse, meat; sheep, 
meat; poultry, fat; poultry, meat; poultry, meat, byproducts; egg; milk; 
fish, shellfish, and irrigated crops when it results from the use of 
sulfuric acid as an inert ingredient in a pesticide product used in 
irrigation conveyance systems and lakes, ponds, reservoirs, or bodies of 
water in which fish or shellfish are cultivated. The sulfuric acid is 
not to exceed 10% of the pesticide formulation (non-aerosol formulations 
only).

exemption covers the acrylate polymers/copolymers that are intrinsically 
safe and already listed in TSCA inventory or will meet the polymer 
tolerance exemption from requirements of premanufacturing notification 
under 40 CFR 723.250. Polymers exempted can be used as dispensers, 
resins, fibers, and beads, as long as the fibers, beads and resins 
particle sizes are greater than 10 microns and insoluble in water. This 
exemption pertains to the acrylate polymers/copolymers used as inert 
ingredients for sprayable and dispenser pesticide formulations that are 
applied on food crops. Any acrylate polymers/copolymers used for 
encapsulating material must be cleared as an inert ingredient when used 
in pesticide formulation applied on food crops.
    (b) For the purposes of this exemption, acrylate polymers/copolymers 
used as inert ingredients in an end-use formulation must meet the 
definition for a polymer as given in 40 CFR 723.250(b), are not 
automatically excluded by 40 723.250(d), and meet the tolerance 
exemption criteria in 40 CFR 723.250(e)(1), 40 CFR 723.250 (e)(2) or 40 
CFR 723.250(e)(3). Therefore, acrylate polymers and copolymers that are 
already listed in the TSCA inventory or will meet the polymer tolerance 
exemption under 40 CFR 723.250 as amended on March 29, 1995 are covered 
by this exemption.
