                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2007), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

Sec. 701.1  Administration.

    (a) Subject to the availability of funds, this part provides the 
terms, conditions and requirements of the Emergency Conservation Program 
(ECP) administered by the Farm Service Agency (FSA).
    (b) ECP is administered by the Administrator, FSA through the Deputy 
Administrator, FSA, and shall be carried out in the field by State and 
county FSA committees (State and county committees), subject to the 
availability of funds. Except as otherwise provided in this rule, 
discretionary determinations to be made under this rule will be made by 
the Deputy Administrator. Matters committed to the discretion of the 
Deputy Administrator shall be considered in all cases to be permissive 
powers and no person shall, under any circumstances, be considered to be 
entitled to an exercise of such power in their favor.
    (c) State and county committees, and representatives and employees, 
do not have authority to modify or waive any regulations in this part.
    (d) The State committee may take any action authorized or required 
of the county committee by this part, but which the county committee has 
not taken, such as:
    (1) Correct or require a county committee to correct any action 
taken by such county committee that is not in accordance with this part; 
or
    (2) Require a county committee to withhold taking any action that is 
not in accordance with this part.
    (e) No provision or delegation herein to a State or county committee 
shall

[[Page 8]]

preclude the Administrator, FSA, or a designee, from determining any 
question arising under the program or from reversing or modifying any 
determination made by a State or county committee.
    (f) The Deputy Administrator may authorize State and county 
committees to waive or modify deadlines and other requirements in cases 
where lateness or failure to meet such other requirements does not 
adversely affect the operation of the program.
    (g) The Deputy Administrator may limit the authority of state and 
county committees to approve cost share in excess of specified amounts.
    (h) Data furnished by the applicants will be used to determine 
eligibility for program benefits. Furnishing the data is voluntary; 
however, the failure to provide data could result in program benefits 
being withheld or denied.

implemented; and
    (3) Be one of the following:
    (i) Land expected to have annual agricultural production,
    (ii) A field windbreak or a farmstead shelterbelt on which the ECP 
practice to be implemented involves removing debris that interferes with 
normal farming operations on the farm and correcting damage caused by 
the disaster; or
    (iii) A farm access road on which debris interfering with the normal 
farming operation needs to be removed.
    (b) Land is ineligible for cost share if the Deputy Administrator 
determines that it is, as applicable:
    (1) Owned or controlled by the United States;
    (2) Owned or controlled by States, including State agencies or other 
political subdivisions of a State;
    (3) Protected by a levee or dike that was not effectively and

    (10) In greenhouses or other confined areas, including but not 
limited to, land in corrals, milking parlors, barn lots, or feeding 
areas;
    (11) Land on which poor farming practices, such as failure to farm 
on the contour, have materially contributed to damaging the land;
    (12) Unless otherwise provided for, not considered to be in annual 
agricultural production, such as land devoted to stream banks, channels, 
levees, dikes, native woodland areas, roads, and recreational uses; or
    (13) Devoted to trees including, but not limited to, timber 
production.
    (c) To determine the likely frequency of damage and of the 
susceptibility of the land to severe damage under paragraph (b)(6) of 
this section, FSA will consider all relevant factors, including, but not 
limited to, the location of the land, the history of damage to the land, 
and whether the land was or could have been protected by a functioning 
levee or dike built to U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, NRCS, or 
comparable standards. Further, in making such determinations, 
information may be obtained and used from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency or any other Federal, State (including State agencies 
or political subdivisions), or other entity or individual providing 
information regarding, for example, flood susceptibility for the land, 
soil surveys, aerial photographs, or flood plain data or other relevant 
information.

Sec. 701.23  Eligible costs.

    (a) Cost-share assistance may be authorized for all reasonable costs 
incurred in the completion of the practice, up to the maximums provided 
in Sec. Sec. 701.26 and 701.27.
    (b) Eligible costs shall be limited as follows:
    (1) Costs for use of personal equipment shall be limited to those

    (b) If more than one participant contributed to the performance of 
the practice, the cost-share assistance for the practice shall be 
divided among those eligible participants in the proportion they 
contributed to the performance of the practice. FSA may determine what 
proportion was contributed by each participant by considering the value 
of the labor, equipment, or material contributed by each participant and 
any other factors deemed relevant toward performance.
    (c) Allowance by a participant of a credit to another participant 
through adjustment in rent, cash or other consideration, may be 
considered as a cost of a practice to the paying party only if FSA 
determines that such credit is directly related to the practice. An 
applicant who was fully reimbursed shall be considered as not having 
contributed to the practice performance.


<R05>
Sec. 701.25  Practices carried out with aid from ineligible persons.

    Any assistance provided by someone other than the eligible 
participant, including assistance from a State or Federal agency, shall

qualified limited resource producer that participates in the ECP may 
receive no more than 90 percent of the participant's actual cost to 
perform the practice or 90 percent of the total allowable costs for the 
practice as determined under this part.

[[Page 13]]

<R05>
Sec. 701.31  Maintenance and proper use of practices.

    (a) Each participant receiving cost-share assistance is responsible 
for the required maintenance and proper use of the practice. Some 
practices have an established life span or minimum period of time during 
which they are expected to function as a conservation practice with 
proper maintenance. Cost-share assistance shall not be authorized for 
normal upkeep or maintenance of any practice.
    (b) If a practice is not properly maintained for the established 
life span, the participant may be required to refund all or part of 
cost-share assistance received. The Deputy Administrator will determine 
what constitutes failure to maintain a practice and the amount that must 
be refunded.


<R05>
Sec. 701.32  Failure to comply with program provisions.

    Costs may be shared for performance actually rendered even though 
the minimum requirements otherwise established for a practice have not 
been satisfied if a reasonable effort was made to satisfy the minimum 
requirements and if the practice, as performed, will adequately address 
the need for the practice.


<R05>
Sec. 701.33  Death, incompetency, or disappearance.

Sec. 701.35  Compliance with regulatory measures.

    Participants who perform practices shall be responsible for 
obtaining the authorities, permits, rights, easements, or other 
approvals necessary to the performance and maintenance of the practices 
according to applicable laws and regulations. The ECP participant shall 
be wholly responsible for any actions taken with respect to the project 
and shall, in addition, be responsible for returning and refunding any 
ECP cost shares made, where the purpose of the project cannot be 
accomplished because of the applicants' lack of clearances or other 
problems.


<R05>
Sec. 701.36  Schemes and devices and claims avoidances.

    (a) If FSA determines that a participant has taken any action 
designed to defeat, or has the effect of defeating, the purposes of this 
program, the participant shall be required to refund all or part of any 
of the program payments otherwise due or paid that participant or 
related person for that particular disaster. These actions include, but 
are not limited to, failure to properly maintain or deliberately 
destroying a practice and providing false or misleading information 
related to practices, costs, or arrangements between entities or 
individuals that would have an effect on ``person'' determinations made 
under this part.
    (b) All or any part of cost-share assistance that otherwise would be 
due any participant may be withheld, or required to be refunded, if the 
participant has adopted, or participated in, any scheme or device 
designed to evade the maximum cost-share limitation that applies to the 
ECP or to evade any other requirement or provision of the program or 
this part.
    (c) If FSA determines that a participant has employed any scheme or 
device to deprive any other person of cost-share assistance, or engaged 
in any actions to receive payments under this part that also were 
designed to avoid claims of the United States or its

[[Page 14]]

instrumentalities or agents against that party, related parties, or 
third parties, the participant shall refund all or part of any of those 
program payments paid to that participant for the project.
    (d) For purposes of this section, a scheme or device can include, 
but is not limited to, instances of coercion, fraud, or 
misrepresentation regarding the claim for ECP assistance and the facts 
and circumstances surrounding such claim.
    (e) A participant who has knowingly supplied false information or 
filed a false claim shall be ineligible for cost-share assistance 
related to the disaster for which the false information was filed, or 
for any period of time FSA deems appropriate. False information or a 
false claim includes, but is not limited to, a request for payment for a 
practice not carried out, a false billing, or a billing for practices 
that do not meet required specifications.


<R05>
Sec. 701.37  Loss of control of the property during the practice life span.

    In the event of voluntary or involuntary loss of control of the land 
by the ECP cost-share recipient during the practice life-span, if the 
person acquiring control elects not to become a successor to the ECP 
agreement and the practice is not maintained, each participant who 
received cost-share assistance for the practice may be jointly and 
severally liable for refunding any ECP cost-share assistance related to 
that practice. The practice life span, for purposes of this section, 
includes any maintenance period that is essential to its success.

Sec. 718.101  Measurements.

    (a) Measurement services include, but are not limited to, measuring 
land and crop areas, quantities of farm-stored commodities, and 
appraising the yields of crops in the field when required for program 
administration purposes. The county committee shall provide measurement 
service if the producer requests such service and pays the cost, except 
that service shall not be provided to determine total acreage or 
production of a crop when the request is made:
    (1) After the established final reporting date for the applicable 
crop, unless a late filed report is accepted as provided in Sec. 
718.103;
    (2) After the farm operator has furnished production evidence when 
required for program administration purposes except as provided in this 
subpart; or
    (3) In connection with a late-filed report of acreage, unless there 
is evidence of the crop's existence in the field and use made of the 
crop, or the lack of the crop due to a disaster condition affecting the 
crop.
    (b) The acreage requested to be measured by staking and referencing 
shall not exceed the effective farm allotment for marketing quota crops 
or acreage of a crop that is limited to a specific number of acres to 
meet any program requirement.
    (c) When a producer requests, pays for, and receives written notice 
that measurement services have been furnished, the measured acreage 
shall be guaranteed to be correct and used for all program purposes for 
the current year even though an error is later discovered in the 
measurement thereof, if the producer has taken action with an economic 
significance based on the measurement service, and the entire crop 
required for the farm was measured. If the producer has not taken action 
with an economic significance based on the measurement service, the 
producer shall be notified in writing that an error was discovered and 
the nature and extent of such error. In such cases, the corrected 
acreage will be used for determining program compliance for the current 
year.
    (d) When a measurement service reveals acreage in excess of the 
permitted acreage and the allowable tolerance as defined in this part, 
the producer must destroy the excess acreage and pay for FSA to verify 
destruction, in order to keep the measurement service guarantee.

Sec. 718.103  Prevented planted and failed acreage.

    (a) Prevented planting is the inability to plant an eligible crop 
with proper equipment during the planting period as a result of an 
eligible cause of loss, as determined by CCC. The eligible cause of loss 
that prevented the planting must have:
    (1) Occurred after a previous planting period for the crop;
    (2) Occurred before the final planting date for the crop in the 
applicable crop year or, in the case of multiple plantings, the harvest 
date of the first planting in the applicable planting period, and
    (3) Similarly affected other producers in the area, as determined by 
CCC.
    (b) To be approved by FSA as prevented planted acreage:
    (1) The acreage must have been reported within 15 calendar days 
after the latter of
    (i) The occurrence of prevented planting, or
    (ii) The end of the planting period;
    (2) The acreage must have been prevented from being planted as the 
result of a natural disaster and not a management decision; and
    (3) The prevented planted acreage report must be acted on by the 
COC. The COC will deny the acreage report if it is not satisfied with 
the documentation provided.
    (c) To receive prevented planted credit for acreage:
    (1) The producer must show there was the intent to plant the acreage 
by providing documentation of field preparation, seed purchase and any 
other information that shows the acreage could have been planted and 
harvested under normal weather conditions, and
    (2) The producer must show that the amount of the prevented planted 
acreage credit is consistent with prior years' planting history for the 
farm.
    (d) Eligible prevented planting acreage will be determined on the 
basis of the producer's intent to plant the crop acreage and possession 
of, or access to, resources to plant, grow, and harvest the crop, as 
applicable.
    (e) Prevented planting acreage credit is not provided on acreage 
that had either a previous or subsequent crop planted on the acreage, 
unless the COC determines that all of the following conditions are met:
    (1) There is an established practice of planting two or more crops 
for harvest on the same acreage in the same crop year;
    (2) Both crops could have reached maturity if each planting was 
harvested or would have been harvested;

[[Page 33]]

    (3) Both the initial and subsequent planted crops were planted or 
prevented-planted within the normal planting period for that crop; and
    (4) Both the initial and subsequent planted crops meet all other 
eligibility provisions of this part including good farming practices.
    (f) Prevented planted acreage credit will not be given to crops 
where the prevented-planted acreage was affected by drought, unless:
    (1) On the final planting date for non-irrigated acreage, the area 
that is prevented from being planted has insufficient soil moisture for 
germination of seed and progress toward crop maturity because of a 
prolonged period of dry weather, as determined by CCC; and
    (2) Prolonged precipitation deficiencies exceeded the D2 level as 
determined using the U.S. Drought Monitor; and
    (3) Verifiable information is collected from sources whose business 
or purpose it is to record weather conditions, as determined by CCC, and 
including but not limited to the local weather reporting stations of the 
U.S. National Weather Service.
    (g) Prevented planted acreage credit under this part shall apply to 
irrigated crops where the acreage was prevented from being planted due 
to a lack of water resulting from drought conditions or contamination by 
saltwater intrusion of an irrigation supply resulting from drought 
conditions if there was not a reasonable probability of having adequate 
water to carry out an irrigation practice.
    (h) Acreage ineligible for prevented planting coverage includes, but 
is not limited to acreage:
    (1) Which planting history or conservation plans indicate would 
remain fallow for crop rotation purposes;
    (2) Used for conservation purposes or intended to be or considered 
to have been left unplanted under any program administered by USDA, 
including the Conservation Reserve and Wetland Reserve Programs; and
    (3) Not planted because of a management decision.
    (i) Failed acreage is acreage that was planted with the proper 
equipment during the planting period but failed as a result of an 
eligible cause of loss, as determined by CCC.
    (j) To be approved by CCC as failed acreage the acreage must have 
been reported as failed acreage before disposition of the crop, and the 
acreage must have been planted under normal conditions but failed as the 
result of a natural disaster and not a management decision. Producers 
who file a failed acreage report must have the request acted on by the 
COC. The COC will deny the acreage report if it is not satisfied with 
the documentation provided.
    (k) To receive failed acreage credit the producer must show all of 
the following:
    (1) That the acreage was planted under normal conditions using the 
proper equipment with the intent to harvest the acreage.
    (2) Provide documentation that the crop was planted using farming 
practices consistent for the crop and area, but could not be brought to 
harvest because of disaster-related conditions.
    (l) The eligible cause for failed acreage must have:
    (1) Occurred after the crop was planted, and
    (2) Before the normal harvest date for the crop in the applicable 
crop year or in the case of multiple plantings, the harvest date of the 
first planting in the applicable planting period, and
    (3) Other producers in the area were similarly affected as 
determined by CCC.
    (m) Eligible failed acreage will be determined on the basis of the 
producer planting the crop under normal conditions with the expectation 
to take the crop to harvest.
    (n) Acreage ineligible for failed acreage credit includes, but is 
not limited to acreage:
    (1) Which was planted using methods that could not be considered 
normal for the area and without the expectation of harvest;
    (2) Used for conservation purposes or intended to be or considered 
to have been un-harvested under any program administered by USDA, 
including the Conservation Reserve and Wetland Reserve Programs; and

[[Page 34]]

    (3) That failed because of a management decision.

    (a) Late-filed acreage reports may be accepted after the final 
reporting date, and be considered timely filed, if both of the following 
apply:
    (1) The crop or identifiable crop residue is in the field, and
    (2) The acreage has not already been determined by FSA.
    (b) The farm operator filing a report late shall pay the cost of a 
farm inspection unless FSA determines that failure to report in a timely 
manner was beyond the producer's control.
    (c) Revised acreage reports may be filed with respect to 2005 and 
subsequent years to change the acreage reported if:
    (1) The acreage has not already been determined by FSA; and
    (2) Actual crop or residue is present in the field.
    (d) Revised reports shall be filed and accepted:
    (1) At any time for all crops if the crop or residue still exists in 
the field for inspection to verify the existence and use made of the 
crop, the lack of the crop, or a disaster condition affecting the crop; 
and
    (2) If the producer was in compliance with all other program 
requirements at the reporting date.

<R05>
Sec. 718.105  Tolerances, variances, and adjustments.

    (a) Tolerance is the amount by which the determined acreage for a 
crop may differ from the reported acreage or allotment for the crop and 
still be considered in compliance with program requirements under 
Sec. Sec. 718.102(b)(1), (b)(3) and (b)(5).
    (b) Tolerance rules apply to those fields for which a staking and 
referencing was performed but such acreage was not planted according to 
those measurements or when a measurement service is not requested for 
acreage destroyed to meet program requirements.
    (c) Tolerance rules do not apply to:
    (1) Program requirements of Sec. Sec. 718.102(b)(2), (b)(4) and 
(b)(6);
    (2) Official fields when the entire field is devoted to one crop;
    (3) Those fields for which staking and referencing was performed and 
such acreage was planted according to those measurements; or
    (4) The adjusted acreage for farms using measurement after planting 
which have a determined acreage greater than the marketing quota crop 
allotment.
    (d) An administrative variance is applicable to all allotment crop 
acreages. Allotment crop acreages as determined in accordance with this 
part shall be deemed in compliance with the effective farm allotment or 
program requirement when the determined acreage does not exceed the 
effective farm allotment by more than an administrative variance 
determined as follows:
    (1) For all kinds of tobacco subject to marketing quotas, except 
dark air-cured and fire-cured the larger of 0.1 acre or 2 percent of the 
allotment; and
    (2) For dark air-cured and fire-cured tobacco, an acreage based on 
the effective acreage allotment as provided in the table as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                         Administrative
   Effective acreage allotment is within this range         variance
------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.01 to 0.99.........................................               0.01
1.00 to 1.49.........................................               0.02
1.50 to 1.99.........................................               0.03
2.00 to 2.49.........................................               0.04
2.50 to 2.99.........................................               0.05
3.00 to 3.49.........................................               0.06
3.50 to 3.99.........................................               0.07
4.00 to 4.49.........................................               0.08
4.50 and up..........................................               0.09
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) A tolerance applies to tobacco, other than flue-cured or burley, 
if the measured acreage exceeds the allotment by more than the 
administrative variance but by not more than the tolerance. Such excess 
acreage of tobacco may be adjusted to the effective farm acreage 
allotment to avoid marketing quota penalties or receive price support.
    (f) If the acreage report for a crop is outside the tolerance for 
that crop:
    (1) FSA may consider the requirements of Sec. Sec. 718.102 (b)(1), 
(b)(3) and (b)(5) not to have been met, and;
    (2) Participants may be ineligible for all or a portion of payments 
or benefits

(b)(5).


<R05>
Sec. 718.106  Non-compliance and fraudulent acreage reports.

    Participants that knowingly and willfully provide false or 
inaccurate acreage reports may be ineligible for some or all payments or 
benefits subject to the requirements of Sec. Sec. 718.102 (b)(1), 
(b)(3) and (b)(5):
    (a) The county committee determines that the acreage report filed 
according to Sec. Sec. 718.102 (b)(1), (b)(3) and (b)(5) is inaccurate, 
and;
    (b) A good-faith effort to accurately report the acreage was not 
made because the report was knowingly and willfully falsified.


<R05>
Sec. 718.107  Acreages.

    (a) If an acreage has been established by FSA for an area delineated 
on an aerial photograph or within a GIS, such acreage will be recognized 
by the county committee as the acreage for the area until such time as 
the boundaries of such area are changed. When boundaries not visible on 
the aerial photograph are established from data furnished by the 
producer, such acreage shall not be recognized as official acreage until 
an authorized representative of FSA verifies the boundaries.
    (b) Measurements of any row crop shall extend beyond the planted 
area by the larger of 15 inches or one-half the distance between the 
rows.
    (c) The entire acreage of a field or subdivision of a field devoted 
to a crop shall be considered as devoted to the crop subject to a 
deduction or adjustment except as otherwise provided in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 718.108  Measuring acreage including skip row acreage.

    (a) When one crop is alternating with another crop, whether or not 
both crops have the same growing season, only the acreage that is 
actually planted to the crop being measured will be considered to be 
acreage devoted to the measured crop.
    (b) Subject to the provisions of this paragraph and section, whether 
planted in a skip row pattern or without a pattern of skipped rows, the 
entire acreage of the field or subdivision may be considered as devoted 
to the crop only where the distance between the rows, for all rows, is 
40 inches or less. If there is a skip that creates idle land wider than 
40 inches, or if the distance between any rows is more than 40 inches, 
then the area planted to the crop shall be considered to be that area 
which would represent the smaller of; a 40 inch width between rows, or 
the normal row spacing in the field for all other rows in the field--
those that are not more than 40 inches apart. The allowance for 
individual rows would be made based on the smaller of actual spacing 
between those rows or the normal spacing in the field. For example, if 
the crop is planted in single, wide rows that are 48 inches apart, only 
20 inches to either side of each row (for a total of 40 inches between 
the two rows) could, at a maximum, be considered as devoted as the crop 
and normal spacing in the field would control. Half the normal distance 
between rows will also be allowed beyond the outside planted rows not to 
exceed 20 inches and will reflect normal spacing in the field.
    (c) In making calculations under this section, further reductions 
may be made in the acreage considered planted if it is determined that 
the acreage is more sparsely planted than normal using reasonable and 
customary full production planting techniques.
    (d) The Deputy Administrator has the discretionary authority to 
allow row allowances other than those specified in this section in those 
instances in which crops are normally planted with spacings greater or 
less than 40 inches, such as in case of tobacco, or where other 
circumstances are present which the Deputy Administrator finds justifies 
that allowance.
    (e) Paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section shall apply with 
respect to the 2003 and subsequent crops. For preceding crops, the rules 
in effect on January 1, 2002, shall apply.


<R05>
Sec. 718.109  Deductions.

    (a) Any contiguous area which is not devoted to the crop being 
measured and which is not part of a skip-row pattern under Sec. 718.108 
shall be deducted from the acreage of the crop if such area

[[Page 36]]

meets the following minimum national standards or requirements:
    (1) A minimum width of 30 inches;
    (2) For tobacco--three-hundredths (.03) acre. Turn areas, terraces, 
permanent irrigation and drainage ditches, sod waterways, non-cropland, 
and subdivision boundaries each of which is at least 30 inches in width 
may be combined to meet the 0.03-acre minimum requirement; or
    (3) For all other crops and land uses--one-tenth (.10) acre. Turn 
areas, terraces, permanent irrigation and drainage ditches, sod 
waterways, non-cropland, and subdivision boundaries each of which is at 
least 30 inches in width and each of which contain 0.1 acre or more may 
be combined to meet any larger minimum prescribed for a State in 
accordance with this subpart.
    (b) If the area not devoted to the crop is located within the 
planted area, the part of any perimeter area that is more than 217.8 
feet (33 links) in width will be considered to be an internal deduction 
if the standard deduction is used.
    (c) A standard deduction of 3 percent of the area devoted to a row 
crop and zero percent of the area devoted to a close-sown crop may be 
used in lieu of measuring the acreage of turn areas.


<R05>
Sec. 718.110  Adjustments.

    (a) The farm operator or other interested producer having excess 
tobacco acreage (other than flue-cured or burley) may adjust an acreage 
of the crop in order to avoid a marketing quota penalty if such person:
    (1) Notifies the county committee of such election within 15 
calendar days after the date of mailing of notice of excess acreage by 
the county committee; and
    (2) Pays the cost of a farm inspection to determine the adjusted 
acreage prior to the date the farm visit is made.
    (b) The farm operator may adjust an acreage of tobacco (except flue-
cured and burley) by disposing of such excess tobacco prior to the 
marketing of any of the same kind of tobacco from the farm. The 
disposition shall be witnessed by a representative of FSA and may take 
place before, during, or after the harvesting of the same kind of 
tobacco grown on the farm. However, no credit will be allowed toward the 
disposition of excess acreage after the tobacco is harvested but prior 
to marketing, unless the county committee determines that such tobacco 
is representative of the entire crop from the farm of the kind of 
tobacco involved.


<R05>
Sec. 718.111  Notice of measured acreage.

    Notice of measured acreage shall be provided by FSA and mailed to 
the farm operator. This notice shall constitute notice to all parties 
who have ownership, leasehold interest, or other, in such farm.


<R05>
Sec. 718.112  Redetermination.

    (a) A redetermination of crop acreage, appraised yield, or farm-
stored production for a farm may be initiated by the county committee, 
State committee, or Deputy Administrator at any time. Redetermination 
may be requested by a producer with an interest in the farm if they pay 
the cost of the redetermination. The request must be submitted to FSA 
within 15 calendar days after the date of the notice described in 
Sec. Sec. 718.110 or 718.111, or within 5 calendar days after the 
initial appraisal of the yield of a crop, or before the farm-stored 
production is removed from storage. A redetermination shall be 
undertaken in the manner prescribed by the Deputy Administrator. A 
redetermination shall be used in lieu of any prior determination.
    (b) The county committee shall refund the payment of the cost for a 
redetermination when, because of an error in the initial determination:
    (1) The appraised yield is changed by at least the larger of:
    (i) Five percent or 5 pounds for cotton;
    (ii) Five percent or 1 bushel for wheat, barley, oats, and rye; or
    (iii) Five percent or 2 bushels for corn and grain sorghum; or
    (2) The farm stored production is changed by at least the smaller of 
3 percent or 600 bushels; or
    (3) The acreage of the crop is:
    (i) Changed by at least the larger of 3 percent or 0.5 acre; or
    (ii) Considered to be within program requirements.

is being farmed by a particular producer. This is accomplished by a 
determination of what land or groups of land `constitute' an individual 
unit or farm. Land, which has been properly constituted under prior 
regulations, shall remain so constituted until a reconstitution is 
required under paragraph (c) of this section. The constitution and 
identification of land as a farm for the first time and the subsequent 
reconstitution of a farm made hereafter, shall include all land operated 
by an individual entity or joint operation as a single farming unit 
except that it shall not include:
    (1) Land under separate ownership unless the owners agree in writing 
and the labor, equipment, accounting system, and management are operated 
in common by the operator but separate from other tracts;
    (2) Land under a lease agreement of less than 1 year duration;
    (3) Land in different counties when the tobacco allotments or quotas 
established for the land involved cannot be transferred from one county 
to another county by lease, sale, or owner. However, this paragraph 
shall not apply if:
    (i) All of the land is contiguous;
    (ii) The land is located in counties that are contiguous in the same 
State if:
    (A) A burley or flue-cured tobacco quota is established for one or 
more of the tracts; and
    (B) The county committee determines that the tracts will be operated 
as a single farming unit as set forth in Sec. 718.202; or
    (iii) Because of a change in operation, tracts or parts of tracts 
will be divided from the parent farm that currently has land in more 
than one county, and there is no change in operation and ownership of 
the remainder of the farm, or if there is a change in ownership, the new 
owner agrees in writing to the constitution of the farm.
    (4) Federally-owned land;
    (5) State-owned wildlife lands unless the former owner has 
possession of the land under a leasing agreement; and
    (6) Land constituting a farm which is declared ineligible to be 
enrolled in a program under the regulations governing the program; and
    (7) For acreage base crops, land located in counties that are not 
contiguous. However, this paragraph shall not apply if:
    (i) Counties are divided by a river;
    (ii) Counties do not touch because of a correction line adjustment; 
or
    (iii) The land is within 20 miles, by road, of other land that will 
be a part of the farming unit.
    (b)(1) If all land on the farm is physically located in one county, 
the farm shall be administratively located in such county. If there is 
no FSA office in the county or the county offices have been 
consolidated, the farm shall be administratively located in the 
contiguous county most convenient for the farm operator.
    (2) If the land on the farm is located in more than one county, the 
farm shall be administratively located in either of such counties as the 
county committees and the farm operator agree. If no agreement can be 
reached, the farm shall be administratively located in the county where 
the principal dwelling is situated, or where the major portion of the 
farm is located if there is no dwelling.
    (c) A reconstitution of a farm either by division or by combination 
shall be required whenever:
    (1) A change has occurred in the operation of the land after the 
last constitution or reconstitution and as a result of such change the 
farm does not meet the conditions for constitution of a farm as set 
forth in paragraph (a) of this section except that no reconstitution 
shall be made if the county committee determines that the primary 
purpose of the change in operation is to establish eligibility to 
transfer allotments subject to sale or lease, or increase amount of 
program benefits received;

[[Page 38]]

    (2) The farm was not properly constituted the previous time;
    (3) An owner requests in writing that the land no longer be included 
in a farm composed of tracts under separate ownership;
    (4) The county committee determines that the farm was reconstituted 
on the basis of false information;
    (5) The county committee determines that tracts included in a farm 
are not being operated as a single farming unit.
    (d) Reconstitution shall not be approved if the county committee 
determines that the primary purpose of the reconstitution is to:
    (1) Circumvent the provisions of part 12 of this title; or
    (2) Circumvent any other chapter of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 718.202  Determining the land constituting a farm.

    (a) In determining the constitution of a farm, consideration shall 
be given to provisions such as ownership and operation. For purposes of 
this part, the following rules shall be applicable to determining what 
land is to be included in a farm.
    (b) A minor shall be considered to be the same owner or operator as 
the parent, court-appointed guardian, or other person responsible for 
the minor child, unless the parent or guardian has no interest in the 
minor's farm or production from the farm, and the minor:
    (1) Is a producer on a farm;
    (2) Maintains a separate household from the parent or guardian;
    (3) Personally carries out the farming activities; and
    (4) Maintains a separate accounting for the farming operation.
    (c) A minor shall not be considered to be the same owner or operator 
as the parent or court-appointed guardian if the minor's interest in the 
farming operation results from being the beneficiary of an irrevocable 
trust and ownership of the property is vested in the trust or the minor.
    (d) A life estate tenant shall be considered to be the owner of the 
property for their life.
    (e) A trust shall be considered to be an owner with the beneficiary 
of the trust; except a trust can be considered a separate owner or 
operator from the beneficiary, if the trust:
    (1) Has a separate and distinct interest in the land or crop 
involved;
    (2) Exercises separate responsibility for the separate and distinct 
interest; and
    (3) Maintains funds and accounts separate from that of any other 
individual or entity for the interest.
    (f) The county committee shall require specific proof of ownership.
    (g) Land owned by different persons of an immediate family living in 
the same household and operated as a single farming unit shall be 
considered as being under the same ownership in determining a farm.
    (h) All land operated as a single unit and owned and operated by a 
parent corporation and subsidiary corporations of which the parent 
corporation owns more than 50 percent of the value of the outstanding 
stock, or where the parent is owned and operated by subsidiary 
corporations, shall be constituted as one farm.


<R05>
Sec. 718.203  County committee action to reconstitute a farm.

    Action to reconstitute a farm may be initiated by the county 
committee, the farm owner, or the operator with the concurrence of the 
owner of the farm. Any request for a farm reconstitution shall be filed 
with the county committee.


<R05>
Sec. 718.204  Reconstitution of allotments, quotas, and bases.

    (a) Farms shall be reconstituted in accordance with this subpart 
when it is determined that the land areas are not properly constituted 
and, to the extent practicable, shall be based on the facts and 
conditions existing at the time the change requiring the reconstitution 
occurred.
    (b) Reconstitutions of farms subject to a direct and counter-
cyclical program contract in accordance with part 1413 of this title 
will be effective for the current year if initiated on or before August 
1 or prior to the issuance of DCP payments for the farm or farms being 
reconstituted.
    (c) For tobacco farms, a reconstitution will be effective for the 
current

[[Page 39]]

year for each crop for which the reconstitution is initiated before the 
planting of such crop begins or would have begun.
    (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, 
a reconstitution may be effective for the current year if the county 
committee determines, and the State committee concurs, that the purpose 
of the request for reconstitution is not to perpetrate a scheme or 
device designed to evade the requirements governing programs found in 
this title.


<R05>
Sec. 718.205  Substantive change in farming operation, and changes in 
related legal entities.

    (a) Land that is properly constituted as a farm shall not be 
reconstituted if:
    (1) The reconstitution request is based upon the formation of a 
newly established legal entity which owns or operates the farm or any 
part of the farm and the county committee determines there is not a 
substantive change in the farming operation;
    (2) The county committee determines that the primary purpose of the 
request for reconstitution is to:
    (i) Obtain additional benefits under one or more commodity programs;
    (ii) Avoid damages or penalties under a contract or statute;
    (iii) Correct an erroneous acreage report; or
    (iv) Circumvent any other program provisions. In addition, no farm 
shall remain as constituted when the county committee determines that a 
substantive change in the farming operation has occurred which would 
require a reconstitution, except as otherwise approved by the State 
committee with the concurrence of the Deputy Administrator.
    (b) In determining whether a substantive change has occurred with 
respect to a farming operation, the county committee shall consider 
factors such as the composition of the legal entities having an interest 
in the farming operation with respect to management, financing, and 
accounting. The county committee shall also consider the use of land, 
labor, and equipment available to the farming operations and any other 
relevant factors that bear on the determination.
    (c) Unless otherwise approved by the State committee with the 
concurrence of the Deputy Administrator, when the county committee 
determines that a corporation, trust, or other legal entity is formed 
primarily for the purpose of obtaining additional benefits under the 
commodity programs of this title, the farm shall remain as constituted, 
or shall be reconstituted, as applicable, when the farm is owned or 
operated by:
    (1) A corporation having more than 50 percent of the stock owned by 
members of the same family living in the same household;
    (2) Corporations having more than 50 percent of the stock owned by 
stockholders common to more than one corporation; or
    (3) Trusts in which the beneficiaries and trustees are family 
members living in the same household.
    (d) Application of the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section 
shall not limit or affect the application of paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section.


<R05>
Sec. 718.206  Determining farms, tracts, allotments, quotas, and bases 
when reconstitution is made by division.

    (a) The methods for dividing farms, tracts, allotments, quotas, and 
bases in order of precedence, when applicable, are estate, designation 
by landowner, contribution, cropland, DCP cropland, default, and 
history. The proper method shall be determined on a crop by crop basis.
    (b)(1) The estate method is the pro-rata distribution of allotments, 
quotas, and bases for a parent farm among the heirs in settling an 
estate. If the estate sells a tract of land before the farm is divided 
among the heirs, the allotments, quotas, and bases for that tract shall 
be determined according to paragraphs (c) through (h) of this section.
    (2) Allotments, quotas, and bases shall be divided in accordance 
with a will, but only if the county committee determines that the terms 
of the will are such that a division can reasonably be made by the 
estate method.
    (3) If there is no will or the county committee determines that the 
terms of a will are not clear as to the division of allotments, quotas, 
and bases, such allotments, quotas, and bases shall be apportioned in 
the manner agreed to in

[[Page 40]]

writing by all interested heirs or devisees who acquire an interest in 
the property for which such allotments, quotas, and bases have been 
established. An agreement by the administrator or executor shall not be 
accepted in lieu of an agreement by the heirs or devisees.
    (4) If allotments, quotas, and bases are not apportioned in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this 
section, the allotments, quotas, and bases shall be divided pursuant to 
paragraphs (d) through (h) of this section, as applicable.
    (c)(1) If the ownership of a tract of land is transferred from a 
parent farm, the transferring owner may request that the county 
committee divide the allotments, quotas, and bases, including historical 
acreage that has been double cropped, between the parent farm and the 
transferred tract, or between the various tracts if the entire farm is 
sold to two or more purchasers, in a manner designated by the owner of 
the parent farm subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (c)(3) 
of this section.
    (2) If the county committee determines that allotments, quotas, and 
bases cannot be divided in the manner designated by the owner because of 
the conditions set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the owner 
shall be notified and permitted to revise the designation so as to meet 
the conditions in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. If the owner does 
not furnish a revised designation of allotments, quotas, and bases 
within a reasonable time after such notification, or if the revised 
designation does not meet the conditions of paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section, the county committee will divide the allotments, quotas, and 
bases in a pro-rata manner in accordance with paragraphs (d) through (h) 
of this section.
    (3) A landowner may designate a manner in which allotments, quotas, 
and bases are divided according to this paragraph.
    (i) The transferring owner and transferee shall file a signed 
written memorandum of understanding of the designation with the county 
committee before any CCC or FSA prescribed form, letter or contract 
providing an allotment, base or quota is issued and before a subsequent 
transfer of ownership of the land. The landowner shall designate the 
allotments, quotas, and bases that shall be permanently reduced when the 
sum of the allotments, quotas, and bases exceeds the cropland for the 
farm.
    (ii) Where the part of the farm from which the ownership is being 
transferred was owned for a period of less than 3 years, the designation 
by landowner method shall not be available with respect to the transfer 
unless the county committee determines that the primary purpose of the 
ownership transfer was other than to retain or to sell allotments, 
quotas, or bases. In the absence of such a determination, and if the 
farm contains land which has been owned for less than 3 years, that part 
of the farm which has been owned for less than 3 years shall be 
considered as a separate farm and the allotments, quotas, or bases, 
shall be assigned to that part in accordance with paragraphs (d) through 
(h) of this section. Such apportionment shall be made prior to any 
designation of allotments, quotas, and bases with respect to the part 
that has been owned for 3 years or more.
    (4) The designation by landowner method is not applicable to crop 
allotments or quotas which are restricted to transfer within the county 
by lease, sale, or by owner, when the land on which the farm is located 
is in two or more counties.
    (5) The designation by landowner method may be applied at the 
owner's request to land owned by any Indian Tribal Council which is 
leased to two or more producers for the production of any crop of a 
commodity for which an allotment, quota, or base has been established. 
If the land is leased to two or more producers, an Indian Tribal Council 
may request that the county committee divide the allotments, quotas, and 
bases between the applicable tracts in the manner designated by the 
Council. The use of this method shall not be subject to the conditions 
of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    (d)(1) The contribution method is the pro-rata distribution of a 
parent farm's allotments and quotas to each tract as the tract 
contributed to the allotments and quotas at the time of combination

[[Page 41]]

and may be used when the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section do not apply.
    (2) The county committee determines and the State committee or a 
representative thereof concurs, that the use of the contribution method 
would not result in an equitable distribution of allotments and quotas, 
considering available land, cultural operations, and changes in type of 
farming.
    (e) The cropland method is the pro-rata distribution of allotments 
and quotas to separate tracts proportionately to the tract's 
contribution to the cropland for the parent tract. This method shall be 
used if paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section do not apply unless 
the county committee determines that division by the history method 
would result in more representative allotments and quotas than the 
cropland method, taking into consideration the operation normally 
carried out on each tract for the commodities produced on the farm.
    (f)(1) The history method is the pro-rata distribution of allotments 
and quotas to separate tracts on the basis of the operation normally 
carried out on each tract of the parent farm. The county committee may 
use the history method of dividing allotments and quotas when it:
    (i) Determines that this method would result in a more accurate pro-
rata distribution of allotments and quotas based on actual contribution 
of the tract to the totals of the parent farm than the cropland method 
would; and
    (ii) Obtains written consent of all owners to use the history 
method.
    (2) The county committee may waive the requirement for written 
consent of the owners for dividing allotments and quotas if the county 
committee determines that the use of the cropland method would result in 
an inequitable division of the parent farm's allotments and quotas and 
the use of the history method would provide more favorable results for 
all owners.
    (g) The DCP cropland method is the pro-rata distribution of bases to 
the resulting tracts in the same proportion to the DCP cropland that 
each resulting tract bears to the DCP cropland for the parent tract. 
This method of division shall be used if paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section do not apply.
    (h) The default method is the separation of tracts from a farm with 
each tract maintaining the bases attributed to the tract when the 
reconstitution is initiated.
    (i)(1) Allotments, quotas, and bases apportioned among the resulting 
farms pursuant to paragraphs (d) through (h) of this section may be 
increased or decreased with respect to a farm by as much as 10 percent 
of the parent farm's allotment, quota, or base determined under such 
subsections for the parent farm if:
    (i) The owners agree in writing; and
    (ii) The county committee determines the method used did not provide 
an equitable distribution considering available land, cultural 
operations, and changes in the type of farming conducted on the farm. 
Any increase in an allotment, quota, or base with respect to a tract 
pursuant to this paragraph shall be offset by a corresponding decrease 
for such allotments, quotas or bases established with respect to the 
other tracts which constitute the farm.
    (2) Farm program payment yields calculated for the resulting farms 
of a division may be increased or decreased if the county committee 
determines the method used did not provide an equitable distribution 
considering available land, cultural operations, and changes in the type 
of farming conducted on the farm. Any increase in a farm program payment 
yield on a resulting farm shall be offset by a corresponding decrease on 
another resulting farm of the division.
    (j) If a farm with burley tobacco quota is divided through 
reconstitution and one or more of the farms resulting from the division 
are apportioned less than 1,000 pounds of burley tobacco quota, the 
owners of such farms shall take action as provided in part 723 of this 
chapter to comply with the 1,000 pound minimum by July 1 of the current 
year or the quota shall be dropped. Exceptions to this are farms 
divided:
    (1) Among family members;
    (2) By the estate method; and
    (3) When no sale or change in ownership of land occurs; or
    (4) With one resulting farm receiving all of the quota.

Sec. 718.207  Determining allotments, quotas, and bases when 
reconstitution is made by combination.

    When two or more farms or tracts are combined for a year, that 
year's allotments, quotas, and bases, with respect to the combined farm 
or tract, as required by applicable commodity regulations, shall not be 
greater than the sum of the allotments, quotas, and bases for each of 
the farms or tracts comprising the combination, subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 718.204.

provisions of this section, it shall only be effective through the year 
in which the error was found and communicated to the participant.


<R05>
Sec. 718.307  Special relief approval authority for State Executive 
Directors.

    (a) General nature of the special authority. Notwithstanding 
provisions in this subpart providing supervision and relief authority to 
other officials, an SED without further review by other officials (other 
than the Secretary) may grant relief to a participant under the 
provisions of Sec. Sec. 718.303 and 718.304 as if the SED were the 
final arbiter within the agency of such matters so long as:
    (1) The program matter with respect to which the relief is sought is 
a program matter in a covered program which is operated within the State 
under the control of the SED;
    (2) The total amount of relief which will be provided to the person 
(that is, to the individual or entity that applies for the relief) by 
that SED under this special authority for errors during that year is 
less than $20,000 (including in that calculation, any loan amount or 
other benefit of any kind payable for that year and any other year);
    (3) The total amount of such relief which has been previously 
provided to the participant using this special authority for errors in 
that year, as calculated above, is not more than $5,000;
    (4) The total amount of loans, payments, and benefits of any kind 
for which relief is provided to similarly situated participants by the 
SED (or the SED's predecessor) for errors for any year under the 
authority provided in this section, as calculated above, is not more 
than $1,000,000.
    (b) Report of the exercise of the power. A grant of relief shall be 
considered to be under this section and subject to the special finality 
provided in this section only if the SED grants the relief in writing 
when granting the relief to the party who will receive the benefit of

[[Page 44]]

such relief and only if, in that document, the SED declares that they 
are exercising that power. The SED must report the exercise of that 
power to the Deputy Administrator so that a full accounting may be made 
in keeping with the limitations of this section. Absent such a report, 
relief will not be considered to have been made under this section.
    (c) Additional limits on the authority. The authority provided under 
this section does not extend to:
    (1) The administration of payment limitations under part 1400 of 
this chapter (Sec. Sec. 1001 to 1001F of 7 U.S.C. 1308 et seq.);
    (2) The administration of payment limitations under a conservation 
program administered by the Secretary; or
    (3) Highly erodible land and wetland conservation requirements under 
subtitles B or C of Title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 
U.S.C. 3811 et seq.) as administered under 7 CFR part 12.
    (d) Relief may not be provided by the SED under this section until a 
written opinion or written acknowledgment is obtained from OGC that 
grounds exist for determination that the program participant has, in 
good faith, detrimentally relied on the guidance or actions of an 
authorized FSA representative in accordance with the provisions of this 
subpart, or that the producer otherwise failed, in good faith, to fully 
comply with the requirements of the program and that the granting of the 
relief is within the lawful authority of the SED.
    (e) Relation to other authorities. The authority provided under this 
section is in addition to any other applicable authority that may allow 
relief. Generally, the SED may, without consultation other than with 
OGC, decide all matters under $20,000 but those decisions shall not be 
subject to modification within the Farm Service Agency to the extent 
provided for under the rules of this section.

    (5) Cancel an EWR only when they are the holder of the warehouse 
receipt;
    (6) Be the holder of an EWR to correct information contained within

                   Payments to Dairy Farmers for Milk


<R05>
Sec. 760.3  Indemnity payments on milk.

    An indemnity payment for milk may be made to an affected farmer who 
is determined by the county committee to be in compliance with all the 
terms and conditions of this subpart in the amount of the fair market 
value of his normal marketings for the application period, as determined 
in accordance with Sec. Sec. 760.4 and 760.5, less (a) any amount he 
received for whole milk marketed during the applications period, and (b) 
any payment not subject to refund which he received from a milk handler 
with respect to whole milk removed from the commercial market during the 
application period.

[43 FR 10535, Mar. 14, 1978, as amended at 47 FR 24689, June 8, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 760.4  Normal marketings of milk.

    (a) The county committee shall determine the affected farmer's 
normal marketings which, for the purposes of this subpart, shall be the 
sum of the quantities of whole milk which such farmer would have sold in 
the commercial market in each of the pay periods in the application 
period but for the removal of his whole milk from the commercial market 
because of the detection of a residue of a violating substance.
    (b) Normal marketings for each pay period are based on the average 
daily production during the base period.
    (c) Normal marketings determined in paragraph (b) of this section 
are adjusted for any change in the daily average number of cows milked 
during each pay period the milk is off the market compared with the 
average number of cows milked daily during the base period.
    (d) If only a portion of a pay period falls within the application 
period, normal marketings for such pay period shall be reduced so that 
they represent only that part of such pay period which is within the 
application period.

[43 FR 10535, Mar. 14, 1978, as amended by Amdt. 1, 44 FR 36360, July 
22, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 760.5  Fair market value of milk.

    (a) The county committee shall determine the fair market value of 
the affected farmer's normal marketings, which, for the purposes of this 
subpart, shall be the sum of the net proceeds such farmer would have 
received for his normal marketings in each of the pay periods in the 
application period.
    (b) The county committee shall determine the net proceeds the 
affected farmer would have received in each of the pay periods in the 
application period (1) in the case of an affected farmer who markets his 
whole milk through a milk handler, by multiplying the affected farmer's 
normal marketings for each such pay period by the average net price per 
hundred-weight of whole milk paid during the pay period by such farmer's 
milk handler in the same area for whole milk similar in quality and 
butterfat test to that marketed by the affected farmer in the base 
period

[[Page 62]]

used to determine his normal marketings, or (2) in the case of an 
affected farmer whose commercial market consists of direct retail sales 
to consumers, by multiplying the affected farmer's normal marketings for 
each such pay period by the average net price per hundredweight of whole 
milk, as determined by the county committee, which other producers in 
the same area who marketed their whole milk through milk handlers 
received for whole milk similar in quality and butterfat test to that 
marketed by the affected farmer during the base period used to determine 
his normal marketings.
    (c) In determining the net price for whole milk, the county 
committee shall deduct from the gross price therefor any transportation, 
administrative, and other costs of marketing which it determines are 
normally incurred by the affected farmer but which were not incurred 
because of the removal of his whole milk from the commercial market.


<R05>
Sec. 760.6  Information to be furnished.

    The affected farmer shall furnish to the county committee complete 
and accurate information sufficient to enable the county committee or 
the Deputy Administrator to make the determinations required in this

of his whole milk from the commercial market, if not included in the 
notice or other evidence of action furnished under paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (c) The quantity and butterfat test of whole milk produced and 
marketed during the base period. This information must be a certified 
statement from the affected farmer's milk handler or any other evidence 
the county committee accepts as an accurate record of milk production 
and butterfat tests during the base period.
    (d) The average number of cows milked during the base period and 
during each pay period in the application.
    (e) If the affected farmer markets his whole milk through a milk 
handler, a statement from the milk handler showing, for each pay period 
in the application period, the average price per hundred-weight of whole 
milk similar in quality to that marketed by the affected farmer during 
the base period used to determine his normal marketings. If the milk 
handler has information as to the transportation, administrative, and 
other costs of marketing which are normally incurred by producers who 
market through the milk handler but which the affected farmer did not 
incur because of removal of his whole milk from the market, the average 
price stated by the milk handler shall be the average gross price paid 
producers less any such costs. If the milk handler does not have such 
information, the affected farmer shall furnish a statement setting forth 
such costs, if any.
    (f) The amount of proceeds, if any, received by the affected farmer 
from the marketing of whole milk produced during the application period.
    (g) The amount of any payments not subject to refund made to the 
affected farmer by the milk handler with respect to the whole milk 
produced during the application period and remove from the commercial

farmer, the name of any pesticide, chemical, or toxic substance used on 
the farm within 24 months prior to the application period, the use made

or toxic substance that caused the contamination of the whole milk, and 
the results of any laboratory tests on the feed supply.

[[Page 63]]

    (j) Such other information as the county committee may request to 
enable the county committee or the Deputy Administrator to make the 
determinations required in this subpart.

registered (if applicable) and approved for use as provided in Sec. 
760.2(f);
    (2) That the contamination of his milk was not the result of his 
failure to use the pesticide, chemical, or toxic substance, according to 
the directions and limitations stated on the label;

had reason to know at the time he acquired them, were contaminated with 
residues of pesticides, chemicals or toxic substances, or by nuclear 
radiation or fallout.
    (3) The contamination of his milk was not otherwise his fault.
    (c) The affected farmer has adopted recommended practices for 
eliminating residues of pesticides, chemicals, or toxic substances or 
contamination from nuclear radiation or fallout from his milk as soon as 
practicable following the discovery of the initial contamination.

is shorter than 28 days, applications for payment may be filed for such 
shorter period. The application for payment shall be accompanied by the 
information required by Sec. 760.6 as well as any other information 
which will enable the county committee to determine whether the making 
of an indemnity payment is precluded for any of the reasons set forth in 
Sec. 760.7. Such information shall be submitted on forms approved for 
the purpose by the Deputy Administrator.

[43 FR 10535, Mar. 14, 1978, as amended at 51 FR 12986, Apr. 17, 1986;

<R05>
Sec. 760.9  Other legal recourse.

    (a) No indemnity payment shall be made for contaminated milk 
resulting from residues of chemicals or toxic substances if, within 30 
days after receiving a complete application, the Deputy Administrator 
determines that other legal recouse is available to the farmer. An 
application shall not be deemed complete unless it contains all 
information necessary to make a determination as to whether other legal 
recourse is available to the farmer. However, notwithstanding such a 
determination, the Deputy Administrator may reopen the case at a later 
date and make a new determination on the merits of the case as may be 
just and equitable.
    (b) In the event that a farmer receives an indemnity payment under 
this subpart, and such farmer is later compensated for the same loss by 
the

[[Page 64]]

person (or the representative or successor in interest of such person) 
responsible for such loss, the indemnity payment shall be refunded by 
the farmer to the Department of Agriculture: Provided, That the amount 
of such refund shall not exceed the amount of other compensation 
received by the farmer.

acres, excluding but not limited to such things as drainage ditches and 
canals, in a stand of fruit trees, bushes, or vines by the producer's 
share in such crop:
    (1) Tier I--$750;
    (2) Tier II--$300;
    (3) Tier III--$200; and
    (4) Tier IV--$90.
    (b) If the actual expenses incurred for damage are greater than the 
value associated with the tier based on the location of the stand, the 
applicant may submit documentation to FSA to request the stand be placed 
in the next lower-numbered tier which represents a

[[Page 83]]

greater level of loss and a higher payment rate. Regardless of the 
expenses incurred the stand can only be placed in the next lower-
numbered tier.

Sec. Sec. 762.1-762.100  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 762.101  Introduction.

    (a) Scope. This subpart contains regulations governing Operating 
Loans and Farm Ownership loans guaranteed by the Farm Service Agency. 
This subpart applies to lenders, holders, borrowers, Agency personnel, 
and other parties involved in making, guaranteeing, holding, servicing, 
or liquidating such loans.
    (b) Policy. The Agency issues guarantees on loans made to qualified 
loan applicants without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national 
origin, marital status, or age, provided the loan applicant can enter 
into a legal and binding contract, or whether all or part of the 
applicant's income derives from any public assistance program or whether 
the applicant, in good faith, exercises any rights under the Consumer 
Protection Act.
    (c) Lender list and classification. (1) The Agency maintains a 
current list of lenders who express a desire to participate in the 
guaranteed loan program. This list is made available to farmers upon 
request.
    (2) Lenders who participate in the Agency guaranteed loan program 
will be classified into one of the following categories:
    (i) Standard Eligible Lender under Sec. 762.105,
    (ii) Certified Lender, or
    (iii) Preferred Lender under Sec. 762.106.
    (3) Lenders may continue to make loans under Approved Lender Program 
(ALP) agreements until they expire; however, these agreements will not 
be renewed when they expire. All ALP agreements with farm credit 
institutions will expire on February 12, 2001.
    (d) Type of guarantee. Guarantees are available for both a loan note 
or a line of credit. A loan note is used for a loan of fixed amount and 
term. A line of credit has a fixed term, but no fixed amount. The 
principal amount outstanding at any time, however, may not exceed the 
line of credit ceiling contained in the contract. Both guarantees are 
evidenced by the same loan guarantee form.
    (e) Termination of loan guarantee. The loan guarantee will 
automatically terminate as follows:
    (1) Upon full payment of the guaranteed loan. A zero balance within 
the period authorized for advances on a line of credit will not 
terminate the guarantee;
    (2) Upon payment of a final loss claim; or
    (3) Upon written notice from the lender to the Agency that a 
guarantee is no longer desired provided the lender holds all of the 
guaranteed portion of the loan. The loan guarantee will be returned to 
the Agency office for cancellation within 30 days of the date of the 
notice by the lender.

secure the loan.
    Agency. The Farm Service Agency, including its employees and state 
and area committee members, and any successor agency.
    Allonge. An attachment or an addendum to a note.
    Applicant. For guaranteed loans, the lender requesting a guarantee 
is the applicant. The party applying to the lender for a loan will be 
considered the loan applicant.
    Aquaculture. The husbandry of aquatic organisms in a controlled or 
selected environment. An aquatic organism is any fish, amphibian, 
reptile, or aquatic plant. An aquaculture operation is considered to be 
a farm only if it is conducted on the grounds which the loan applicant 
owns, leases, or has an exclusive right to use. An exclusive right to 
use must be evidenced by a permit issued to the loan applicant and the 
permit must specifically identify the waters available to be used by the 
loan applicant only.
    Assignment of guaranteed portion. A process by which the lender 
transfers the right to receive payments or income on the guaranteed loan 
to another party, usually in return for payment in the amount of the 
loan's guaranteed principal. The lender retains the unguaranteed portion 
in its portfolio and receives a fee from the purchaser or assignee to 
service the loan, and receive and remit payments according to a written 
assignment agreement. This assignment can be reassigned or sold multiple 
times.
    Average farm customers. Those conventional farm borrowers who are 
required to pledge their crops, livestock, and other chattel and real 
estate security for the loan. This does not include those high-risk 
farmers with limited security and management ability who are generally 
charged a higher interest rate by conventional agricultural lenders. 
Also, this does not include those low-risk farm customers who obtain 
financing on a secured or unsecured basis, who have as collateral such 
items as savings accounts, time deposits, certificates of deposit, 
stocks and bonds, and life insurance, which they are able to pledge for 
the loan.

ranch for not more than 10 years. This requirement applies to all 
members of an entity;
    (3) Will materially and substantially participate in the operation 
of the farm or ranch:
    (i) In the case of a loan made to an individual, individually or 
with the immediate family, material and substantial participation 
requires that the individual provide substantial day-to-day labor and 
management of the farm or ranch, consistent with the practices in the 
county or State where the farm is located.
    (ii) In the case of a loan made to an entity, all members must 
materially and substantially participate in the operation of the farm or 
ranch. Material and substantial participation requires that the 
individual provide some amount of the management, or labor and 
management necessary for day-to-day activities, such that if the 
individual did not provide these inputs, operation of the farm or ranch 
would be seriously impaired;
    (4) Agrees to participate in any loan assessment and financial 
management programs required by Agency regulations;
    (5) Does not own real farm or ranch property or who, directly or 
through interests in family farm entities, owns

ranches in the county where the property is located. If the farm is 
located in more than one county, the average farm acreage of the county 
where the loan applicant's residence is located will be used in the 
calculation. If the applicant's residence is not located on the farm or 
if the loan applicant is an entity, the average farm acreage of the 
county where the major portion of the farm is located will be used. The 
average county farm or ranch acreage will be determined from the most 
recent Census of Agriculture developed by the U.S. Department of 
Commerce, Bureau of the Census or USDA;
    (6) Demonstrates that the available resources of the loan applicant 
and spouse (if any) are not sufficient to enable the loan applicant to

have been discharged of all Agency debt.
    Capital leases. Agreements under which the lessee effectively

all cash outflows (including all farm and nonfarm debt service and other 
expenses) to be incurred by the borrower during the period of the 
budget. Cash flow budgets for loans under $50,000 do not require income 
and expenses itemized by categories. Cash flow budgets for loans under 
$125,000 do not require income and expenses itemized by categories. It 
may also be prepared with a breakdown of cash inflows and outflows for 
each month of the review period and includes the expected outstanding

business under a new name or undergoes an ownership change the lender 
will notify the Agency.

    (4) PLP status will be conditioned on the lender carrying out its 
credit management system as proposed in its request for PLP status and 
any additional loan making or servicing requirements agreed to and

rate to the PLP maximum rate within two years from the date of the plan,

standard was beyond the control of the lender. Examples include, but are 
not limited to, a freeze with only local impact, economic downturn in a 
local area, drop in local land values, industries moving into or out of 
an area, loss of access to a market, and biological or chemical damage.

submitting loan guarantee requests. They may reapply for CLP or PLP 
status when the problem causing them to lose their status has been

demonstrate that compliance with the standards will cause them 
substantial economic injury; and
    (x) Payment of training costs required or recommended by the Agency.
    (2) Loan funds under a line of credit may be advanced only for the 
following purposes:
    (i) Payment of annual operating expenses, family subsistence, and

loan applicant's portion of land being subdivided, and participating in 
the beginning farmer downpayment FO program under part 1943, subpart A, 
of this title;
    (2) Make capital improvements; examples include, but are not limited

    (c) Highly erodible land or wetlands conservation. Loans may not be 
made for any purpose which contributes to excessive erosion of highly 
erodible land or to the conversion of wetlands to produce an 
agricultural commodity. A decision by the Agency to reject an 
application for this reason may be appealable. An appeal questioning 
whether the presence of a wetland, converted wetland, or highly erodible 
land on a particular property must be filed directly with the USDA 
agency making the determination in accordance with the agency's appeal 
procedures.
    (d) Judgment debts. Loans may not be used to satisfy judgments 
obtained in the United States District courts. However, Internal Revenue 
Service judgment liens may be paid with loan funds.


<R05>
Sec. 762.122  Loan limitations.

    (a) OL term limitations. (1) No guaranteed OL shall be made to any 
loan applicant after the 15th year that a loan applicant, or any 
individual signing the promissory note, received a direct or guaranteed 
OL.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if a borrower 
had any combination of direct or guaranteed OL closed in 10 or more 
prior calendar years prior to October 28, 1992, eligibility to receive 
new guaranteed OL is extended for 5 additional years from October 28, 
1992, and the years need not run consecutively. However, in the case of 
a line of credit, each year in which an advance is made after October 
28, 1992, counts toward the 5 additional years. Once determined 
eligible, a loan or line of credit may be approved for any authorized 
term.
    (b) Leased land. When FO funds are used for improvements to leased 
land the terms of the lease must provide reasonable assurance that the 
loan applicant will have use of the improvement over its useful life, or 
provide compensation for any unexhausted value of the improvement if the 
lease is terminated.
    (c) Tax-exempt transactions. The Agency will not guarantee any loan 
made with the proceeds of any obligation the interest on which is 
excluded from income under section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986. Funds generated through the issuance of tax-exempt obligations may 
not be used to purchase the guaranteed portion of any Agency guaranteed 
loan. An Agency guaranteed loan may not serve as collateral for a tax-
exempt bond issue.
    (d) Floodplain restrictions. The Agency will not guarantee any loan 
to purchase, build, or expand buildings located in a special 100 year 
floodplain as defined by FEMA flood hazard area maps unless flood 
insurance is available and purchased.

[64 FR 7378, Feb. 12, 1999; 64 FR 38298, July 16, 1999, as amended at 66

<R05>
Sec. 762.123  Insurance and farm inspection requirements.

    (a) Insurance. (1) Lenders must require borrowers to maintain 
adequate property, public liability, and crop insurance to protect the 
lender and Government's interests.
    (2) By loan closing, loan applicants must either:
    (i) Obtain at least the catastrophic risk protection (CAT) level of 
crop insurance coverage, if available, for each crop of economic 
significance, as defined by part 402 of this title, or
    (ii) Waive eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in 
connection with the uninsured crop. EM loan assistance under part 1945, 
subpart D, of this title is not considered emergency crop loss 
assistance for purposes of this waiver and execution of the waiver does 
not render the borrower ineligible for EM loans.
    (3) Loan applicants must purchase flood insurance if buildings are 
or will be located in a special flood hazard area as defined by FEMA 
flood hazard

[[Page 100]]

area maps and if flood insurance is available.
    (4) Insurance, including crop insurance, must be obtained as 
required by the lender or the Agency based on the strengths and 
weaknesses of the loan.
    (b) Farm inspections. Before submitting an application the lender 
must make an inspection of the farm to assess the suitability of the 
farm and to determine any development that is needed to make it a 
suitable farm.

[64 FR 7378, Feb. 12, 1999, as amended at 70 FR 56107, Sept. 26, 2005]


<R05>
Sec. 762.124  Interest rates, terms, charges, and fees.

    (a) Interest rates. (1) The interest rate on a guaranteed loan or 
line of credit may be fixed or variable as agreed upon between the 
borrower and the lender. The lender may charge different rates on the 
guaranteed and the non-guaranteed portions of the note. The guaranteed 
portion may be fixed while the unguaranteed portion may be variable, or 
vice versa. If both portions are variable, different bases may be used.
    (2) If a variable rate is used, it must be tied to a rate 
specifically agreed to between the lender and borrower in the loan 
instruments. Variable rates may change according to the normal practices 
of the lender for its average farm customers, but the frequency of 
change must be specified in the loan or line of credit instrument.
    (3) Neither the interest rate on the guaranteed portion nor the 
unguaranteed portion may exceed the rate the lender charges its average 
agricultural loan customer. At the request of the Agency, the lender 
must provide evidence of the rate charged the average agricultural loan 
customer. This evidence may consist of average yield data, or documented 
administrative differential rate schedule formulas used by the lender.
    (4) Interest must be charged only on the actual amount of funds 
advanced and for the actual time the funds are outstanding. Interest on 
protective advances made by the lender to protect the security will be 
charged at the note rate but limited to paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section.
    (5) The lender and borrower may collectively obtain a temporary 
reduction in the interest rate through the interest assistance program 
in accordance with Sec. 762.150.
    (b) OL terms. (1) Loan funds or advances on a line of credit used to 
pay annual operating expenses will be repaid when the income from the 
year's operation is received, except when the borrower is establishing a 
new enterprise, developing a farm, purchasing feed while feed crops are 
being established, or recovering from disaster or economic reverses.
    (2) The final maturity date for each loan cannot exceed 7 years from 
the date of the promissory note or line of credit agreement. Advances 
for purposes other than for annual operating expenses will be scheduled 
for repayment over the minimum period necessary considering the loan 
applicant's ability to repay and the useful life of the security, but 
not in excess of 7 years.
    (3) All advances on a line of credit must be made within 5 years 
from the date of the Loan Guarantee.
    (c) FO terms. Each loan must be scheduled for repayment over a 
period not to exceed 40 years from the date of the note or such shorter 
period as may be necessary to assure that the loan will be adequately 
secured, taking into account the probable depreciation of the security.
    (d) Balloon installments under loan note guarantee. Balloon payment 
terms are permitted on FO or OL subject to the following:
    (1) Extended repayment schedules may include equal, unequal, or 
balloon installments if needed on any guaranteed loan to establish a new 
enterprise, develop a farm, or recover from a disaster or an economical 
reversal.
    (2) Loans with balloon installments must have adequate collateral at 
the time the balloon installment comes due. Crops, livestock other than 
breeding livestock, or livestock products produced are not sufficient 
collateral for securing such a loan.
    (3) The borrower must be projected to be able to refinance the 
remaining debt at the time the balloon payment comes due based on the 
expected financial condition of the operation, the depreciated value of 
the collateral, and the principal balance on the loan.

[[Page 101]]

    (e) Charges and Fees. (1) The lender may charge the loan applicant 
and borrower fees for the loan provided they are no greater than those 
charged to unguaranteed customers for similar transactions. Similar 
transactions are those involving the same type of loan requested (for 
example, operating loans or farm real estate loans).
    (2) Late payment charges (including default interest charges) are 
not covered by the guarantee. These charges may not be added to the 
principal and interest due under any guaranteed note or line of credit. 
However, late payment charges may be made outside of the guarantee if 
they are routinely made by the lender in similar types of loan 
transactions.
    (3) Lenders may not charge a loan origination and servicing fee 
greater than 1 percent of the loan amount for the life of the loan when 
a guaranteed loan is made in conjunction with a down payment FO for 
beginning farmers under part 1943, subpart A, of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 762.125  Financial feasibility.

    (a) General. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
section, PLP lenders will follow their internal procedures on financial 
feasibility as agreed to by the Agency during PLP certification.
    (2) The loan applicant's proposed operation must project a feasible 
plan as defined in Sec. 762.102(b).
    (3) For standard eligible lenders, the projected income and expenses 
of the borrower and operation used to determine a feasible plan must be 
based on the loan applicant's proven record of production and financial 
management.
    (4) For CLP lenders, the projected income and expenses of the 
borrower and the operation must be based on the loan applicant's 
financial history and proven record of financial management.
    (5) For those farmers without a proven history, a combination of any 
actual history and any other reliable source of information that are 
agreeable with the lender, the loan applicant, and the Agency will be 
used.
    (6) The cash flow budget analyzed to determine a feasible plan must 
represent the predicted cash flow of the operating cycle.
    (7) Lenders must use price forecasts that are reasonable and 
defensible. Sources must be documented by the lender and acceptable to 
the Agency.
    (8) When a feasible plan depends on income from other sources in 
addition to income from owned land, the income must be dependable and 
likely to continue.
    (9) The lender will analyze business ventures other than the farm 
operation to determine their soundness and contribution to the 
operation. Guaranteed loan funds will not be used to finance a nonfarm 
enterprise. Nonfarm enterprises include, but are not limited to: raising 
earthworms, exotic birds, tropical fish, dogs, or horses for nonfarm 
purposes; welding shops; boarding horses; and riding stables.
    (10) When the loan applicant has or will have a cash flow budget 
developed in conjunction with a proposed or existing Agency direct loan, 
the two cash flow budgets must be consistent.
    (b) Estimating production. (1) Standard eligible lenders must use 
the best sources of information available for estimating production in 
accordance with this subsection when developing cash flow budgets.
    (2) Deviations from historical performance may be acceptable, if 
specific to changes in operation and adequately justified and acceptable 
to the Agency.
    (3) For existing farmers, actual production for the past 3 years 
will be utilized.
    (4) For those farmers without a proven history, a combination of any 
actual history and any other reliable source of information that are 
agreeable with the lender, the loan applicant, and the Agency will be 
used.
    (5) When the production of a growing commodity can be estimated, it 
must be considered when projecting yields.
    (6) When the loan applicant's production history has been so 
severely affected by a declared disaster that an accurate projection 
cannot be made, the following applies:
    (i) County average yields are used for the disaster year if the loan 
applicant's disaster year yields are less than the

[[Page 102]]

county average yields. If county average yields are not available, State 
average yields are used. Adjustments can be made, provided there is 
factual evidence to demonstrate that the yield used in the farm plan is 
the most probable to be realized.
    (ii) To calculate a historical yield, the crop year with the lowest 
actual or county average yield may be excluded, provided the loan 
applicant's yields were affected by disasters at least 2 of the previous 
5 consecutive years.
    (c) Refinancing. Loan guarantee requests for refinancing must ensure 
that a reasonable chance for success still exists. The lender must 
demonstrate that problems with the loan applicant's operation that have 
been identified, can be corrected, and the operation returned to a sound 
financial basis.

[64 FR 7378, Feb. 12, 1999, as amended at 66 FR 7567, Jan. 24, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 762.126  Security requirements.

    (a) General. (1) The lender is responsible for ensuring that proper 
and adequate security is obtained and maintained to fully secure the 
loan, protect the interest of the lender and the Agency, and assure 
repayment of the loan or line of credit.
    (2) The lender will obtain a lien on additional security when 
necessary to protect the Agency's interest.
    (b) Guaranteed and unguaranteed portions. (1) All security must 
secure the entire loan or line of credit. The lender may not take 
separate security to secure only that portion of the loan or line of 
credit not covered by the guarantee.
    (2) The lender may not require compensating balances or certificates 
of deposit as means of eliminating the lender's exposure on the 
unguaranteed portion of the loan or line of credit. However, 
compensating balances or certificates of deposit as otherwise used in 
the ordinary course of business are allowed for both the guaranteed and 
unguaranteed portions.
    (c) Identifiable security. The guaranteed loan must be secured by 
identifiable collateral. To be identifiable, the lender must be able to 
distinguish the collateral item and adequately describe it in the 
security instrument.
    (d) Type of security. (1) Guaranteed loans may be secured by any 
property if the term of the loan and expected life of the property will 
not cause the loan to be undersecured.
    (2) For loans with terms greater than 7 years, a lien must be taken 
on real estate.
    (3) Loans can be secured by a mortgage on leasehold properties if 
the lease has a negotiable value and is subject to being mortgaged.
    (4) The lender or Agency may require additional personal and 
corporate guarantees to adequately secure the loan. These guarantees are 
separate from, and in addition to, the personal obligations arising from 
members of an entity signing the note as individuals.
    (e) Lien position. All guaranteed loans will be secured by the best 
lien obtainable. Provided that:
    (1) Any chattel-secured guaranteed loan must have a higher lien 
priority (including purchase money interest) than an unguaranteed loan 
secured by the same chattels and held by the same lender.
    (2) Junior lien positions are acceptable only if the total amount of 
debt with liens on the security, including the debt in junior lien 
position, is less than or equal to 85 percent of the value of the 
security. Junior liens on crops or livestock products will not be relied 
upon for security unless the lender is involved in multiple guaranteed 
loans to the same borrower and also has the first lien on the 
collateral.
    (3) When taking a junior lien, prior lien instruments will not 
contain future advance clauses (except for taxes, insurance, or other 
reasonable costs to protect security), or cancellation, summary 
forfeiture, or other clauses that jeopardize the Government's or the 
lender's interest or the borrower's ability to pay the guaranteed loan, 
unless any such undesirable provisions are limited, modified, waived or 
subordinated by the lienholder for the benefit of the Agency and the 
lender.
    (f) Additional security, or any loan of $10,000 or less may be 
secured by the best lien obtainable on real estate without title 
clearance or legal services normally required, provided the lender 
believes from a search of the county records that the loan applicant

[[Page 103]]

can give a mortgage on the farm and provided that the lender would, in 
the normal course of business, waive the title search. This exception to 
title clearance will not apply when land is to be purchased.
    (g) Multiple owners. If security has multiple owners, all owners 
must execute the security documents for the loan.
    (h) Exceptions. The Deputy Administrator for Farm Loan Programs has 
the authority to grant an exception to any of the requirements involving 
security, if the proposed change is in the best interest of the 
Government and the collection of the loan will not be impaired.

<R05>
Sec. 762.127  Appraisal requirements.

    (a) General. The Agency may require a lender to obtain an appraisal 
based on the type of security, loan size, and whether it is primary or 
additional security. Except for authorized liquidation expenses, the 
lender is responsible for all appraisal costs, which may be passed on to 
the borrower, or a transferee in the case of a transfer and assumption.
    (b) Exception. Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, an 
appraisal is not required for any additional security, or for loans of 
$50,000 or less if a strong equity position exists.
    (c) Chattel appraisals. A current appraisal (not more than 12 months 
old) of primary chattel security is generally required on all loans. An 
appraisal for loans or lines of credit for annual production purposes 
that are secured by crops is only required when a guarantee is requested 
late in the current production year and actual yields can be reasonably 
estimated. The appraised value of chattel property will be based on 
public sales of the same, or similar, property in the market area. In 
the absence of such public sales, reputable publications reflecting 
market values may be used. Appraisal reports may be on the Agency's 
appraisal of chattel property form or on any other appraisal form 
containing at least the same information. Chattel appraisals will be 
performed by appraisers who possess sufficient experience or training to 
establish market (not retail) values as determined by the Agency.
    (d) Real estate appraisals. A current real estate appraisal is 
required when real estate will be primary security. Agency officials may 
accept an appraisal that is not current if there have been no 
significant changes in the market or on the subject real estate and the 
appraisal was either completed within the past 12 months or updated by a 
qualified appraisal if not completed within the past 12 months.
    (1) Appraiser qualifications. On loan transactions of $250,000 or 
less, the lender must demonstrate to the Agency's satisfaction that the 
appraiser possesses sufficient experience or training to estimate the 
market value of agricultural property. On loan transactions greater than 
$250,000, which includes principal plus accrued interest through the 
closing date, the appraisal must be completed by a State certified 
general appraiser.
    (2) Appraisals. Real estate appraisals must be completed in 
accordance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal 
Practice. Appraisals may be either a complete or limited appraisal 
provided in a self-contained or summary format. Restricted reports, as 
defined in the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, are 
not acceptable.

Sec. 762.128  Environmental and special laws.

    (a) Environmental requirements. The requirements found in part 1940, 
subpart G, of this title must be met for guaranteed OL and FO. CLP and 
PLP lenders may certify that they have documentation in their file to 
demonstrate compliance with paragraph (c) of this section. Standard 
eligible lenders must submit evidence supporting compliance with this 
section.
    (b) Determination. The Agency determination of whether an 
environmental problem exists will be based on:
    (1) The information supplied with the application;
    (2) The Agency Official's personal knowledge of the operation;

[[Page 104]]

    (3) Environmental resources available to the Agency including, but 
not limited to, documents, third parties, and governmental agencies;
    (4) A visit to the farm operation when the available information is 
insufficient to make a determination;
    (5) Other information supplied by the lender or loan applicant upon 
Agency request. If necessary, information not supplied with the 
application will be requested by the Agency.
    (c) Special requirements. Lenders will assist in the environmental 
review process by providing environmental information. In all cases, the 
lender must retain documentation of their investigation in the loan 
applicant's case file.
    (1) A determination must be made as to whether there are any 
potential impacts to a 100 year floodplain as defined by Federal 
Emergency Management Agency floodplain maps, Natural Resources 
Conservation Service data, or other appropriate documentation.
    (2) The lender will assist the borrower in securing any applicable 
permits or waste management plans. The lender may consult with the 
Agency for guidance on activities which require consultation with State 
regulatory agencies, special permitting or waste management plans.
    (3) The lender will examine the security property to determine if 
there are any structures or archeological sites which are listed or may 
be eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The 
lender may consult with the Agency for guidance on which situations will 
need further review in accordance with the National Historical 
Preservation Act and part 1940, subpart G, and part 1901, subpart F, of 
this title.
    (4) The loan applicant must certify they will not violate the 
provisions of Sec. 363 of the CONACT, the Food Security Act of 1985, 
and Executive Order 11990 relating to Highly Erodible Land and Wetlands.
    (5) All lenders are required to ensure that due diligence is 
performed in conjunction with a request for guarantee of a loan 
involving real estate. Due diligence is the process of evaluating real 
estate in the context of a real estate transaction to determine the 
presence of contamination from release of hazardous substances, 
petroleum products, or other environmental hazards and determining what 
effect, if any, the contamination has on the security value of the 
property. The Agency will accept as evidence of due diligence the most 
current version of the American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM) 
transaction screen questionnaire available from 100 Barr Harbor Drive, 
West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428-2959, or similar documentation, 
approved for use by the Agency, supplemented as necessary by the ASTM 
phase I environmental site assessments form.
    (d) Equal opportunity and nondiscrimination. (1) With respect to any 
aspect of a credit transaction, the lender will not discriminate against 
any applicant on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, 
sex, marital status, or age, provided the applicant can execute a legal 
contract. Nor will the lender discriminate on the basis of whether all 
or a part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance 
program, or whether the applicant in good faith, exercises any rights 
under the Consumer Protection Act.
    (2) Where the guaranteed loan involves construction, the contractor 
or subcontractor must file all compliance reports, equal opportunity and 
nondiscrimination forms, and otherwise comply with all regulations 
prescribed by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to Executive Orders 11246 
and 11375.
    (e) Other Federal, State and local requirements. Lenders are 
required to coordinate with all appropriate Federal, State, and local 
agencies and comply with special laws and regulations applicable to the 
loan proposal.


<R05>
Sec. 762.129  Percent of guarantee and maximum loss.

    (a) General. The percent of guarantee will not exceed 90 percent 
based on the credit risk to the lender and the Agency both before and

    (2) When the purpose of an FO guarantee is to participate in the 
downpayment loan program;
    (3) When a guaranteed OL is made to a farmer or rancher who is 
participating in the Agency's down payment loan program. The guaranteed 
OL must be made during the period that a borrower has the down payment 
loan outstanding; or

or ranch land is subject to the jurisdiction of an Indian tribe and 
whose loan is secured by one or more security instruments that are 
subject to the jurisdiction of an Indian tribe.
    (c) CLP and PLP guarantees. All guarantees issued to CLP or PLP 
lenders will not be less than 80 percent.

the guaranteed portion including:
    (1) The pro rata share of principal and interest indebtedness as 
evidenced by the note or by assumption agreement;
    (2) Any loan subsidy due and owing;
    (3) The pro rata share of principal and interest indebtedness on 
secured protective and emergency advances made in accordance with this 
subpart; and
    (4) Principal and interest indebtedness on recapture debt pursuant 
to a shared appreciation agreement. Provided that the lender has paid 
the Agency its pro rata share of the recapture amount due.

inspections during construction and after the guarantee has been issued. 
The Agency may attend these field inspections. Any inspections or review 
performed by the Agency, including those with the lender, are solely for

parties of their inspection responsibilities, nor can these parties rely 
on Agency inspections for any purpose.

[[Page 107]]

individuals. Individual liability can be waived by the Agency for 
members holding less than 10 percent ownership in the entity if the 
collectability of the loan will not be impaired; and
    (5) When the loan purpose is to refinance or restructure the 
lender's own debt, the lender may continue to use the existing debt 
instrument and attach an allonge that modifies the terms of the original 
note.
    (f) Replacement of loan guarantee, or assignment guarantee 
agreement. If the guarantee or assignment guarantee agreements are lost, 
stolen, destroyed, mutilated, or defaced, except where the evidence of 
debt was or is a bearer instrument, the Agency will issue a replacement

    (2) The lender cannot enforce the guarantee to the extent that a 
loss results from a violation of usury laws or negligent servicing.
    (b) Borrower supervision. The lender's responsibilities regarding 
borrower supervision include, but are not limited to the following:
    (1) Ensuring loan funds are not used for unauthorized purposes.
    (2) Ensuring borrower compliance with the covenants and provisions

condition to determine the borrower's progress. The annual analysis will 
include:
    (i) For loans secured by real estate only, the analysis for standard 
eligible lenders must include an analysis of the borrower's balance 
sheet. CLP lenders will determine the need for the annual analysis based 
on the financial strength of the borrower and document the file 
accordingly. PLP lenders will perform an annual analysis in accordance

    (ii) The security item will be used as a trade-in or source of down 
payment funds for a like item that will be taken as security.

increase the value of the security by an amount equal to or greater than 
the value of the security being released.
    (ii) Security will be released outright with no consideration, but

    (c) Subordinations. (1) The Agency may subordinate its security 
interest on a direct loan when a guaranteed loan is being made if the 
requirements of the regulations governing Agency direct loan 
subordinations are met and only in the following circumstances:
    (i) To permit a guaranteed lender to advance funds and perfect a 
security interest in crops, feeder livestock, livestock offspring, or 
livestock products;
    (ii) When the lender requesting the guarantee needs the 
subordination of the Agency's lien position to maintain its lien 
position when servicing or restructuring;
    (iii) When the lender requesting the guarantee is refinancing the 
debt of another lender and the Agency's position on real estate security 
will not be adversely affected; or
    (iv) To permit a line of credit to be advanced for annual operating 
expenses.
    (2) The Agency may subordinate its basic security in a direct loan

    (i) The total unpaid balance of the direct loans is less than or 
equal to 75 percent of the value of all of the security for the direct 
loans, excluding the value of growing crops or planned production, at 
the time of the subordination. The direct loan security value will be 
determined by an appraisal. The lender requesting the subordination and 
guarantee is responsible for providing the appraisal and may charge the 
applicant a reasonable appraisal fee.
    (ii) The applicant cannot obtain sufficient credit through a 
conventional guaranteed loan without a subordination.
    (3) The lender may not subordinate its interest in property which 
secures a guaranteed loan except as follows:
    (i) The lender may subordinate its security interest in crops, 
feeder livestock, livestock offspring, or livestock products when no 
funds have been advanced from the guaranteed loan for their production, 
so a lender can make a loan for annual production expenses; or
    (ii) The lender may, with written Agency approval, subordinate its 
interest in basic security in cases where the subordination is required 
to allow another lender to refinance an existing

[[Page 110]]

prior lien, no additional debt is being incurred, and the lender's 
security position will not be adversely affected by the subordination.
    (iii) The Agency's national office may provide an exception to the 
subordination prohibition if such action is in the Agency's best 
interest. However, in no case can the loan made under the subordination 
include tax exempt financing.
    (d) Transfer and assumption. Transfers and assumptions are subject 
to the following conditions:
    (1) For standard eligible and CLP lenders, the servicing action must 
be approved by the Agency in writing.
    (2) For standard eligible and CLP lenders, the transferee must apply 
for a loan in accordance with Sec. 762.110, including a current 
appraisal, unless the lien position of the guaranteed loan will not

    (6) The transferee must meet the eligibility requirements and loan 
limitations for the loan being transferred, all requirements relating to 
loan rates and terms, loan security, feasibility, and environmental and 
other laws applicable to a loan applicant under this part.
    (7) The lender will use its own assumption agreements or conveyance 
instruments, providing they are legally sufficient to obligate the 
transferee for the total outstanding debt. The lender will provide the 
Agency copies of any agreements executed to carry out the servicing 
action.
    (8) The Agency approves the transfer and assumption by executing a 
modification of the guarantee to designate the party that assumed the 
guaranteed debt, the amount of debt at the time of the assumption, 
including interest that is being capitalized, and any new loan terms, if 
applicable.
    (9) The lender must give any holder notice of the transfer. If the 
rate and terms are changed, written concurrence from the holder is 
required.

Sec. 762.143  Servicing distressed accounts.

    (a) A borrower is in default when 30 days past due on a payment or 
in violation of provisions of the loan documents.
    (b) In the event of a borrower default, SEL and CLP lenders will:
    (1) Report to the Agency in accordance with Sec. 762.141.
    (2) Determine whether it will repurchase the guaranteed portion from 
the holder in accordance with Sec. 762.144, if the guaranteed portion 
of the loan was sold on the secondary market.
    (3) Arrange a meeting with the borrower within 15 days of default 
(45 days after payment due date for monetary defaults) to identify the 
nature of the delinquency and develop a course of action that will 
eliminate the delinquency and correct the underlying problems. Non-
monetary defaults will be handled in accordance with the lender's note, 
loan agreements and any other applicable loan documents.
    (i) The lender and borrower will prepare a current balance sheet and 
cash flow projection in preparation for the meeting. If the borrower 
refuses to cooperate, the lender will compile the best financial 
information available.
    (ii) The lender or the borrower may request the attendance of an 
Agency credit officer. If requested, the Agency credit officer will 
assist in developing solutions to the borrower's financial problems.
    (iii) The lender will summarize the meeting and proposed solutions 
on the Agency form for guaranteed loan borrower default status completed

[[Page 111]]

within 90 days of default, unless the lender can document circumstances 
that justify an extension by the Agency.
    (v) The lender may not initiate foreclosure action on the loan until 
60 days after eligibility of the borrower to participate in the interest 
assistance programs has been determined by the Agency. If the lender or 
the borrower does not wish to consider servicing options under this 
section, this should be documented, and liquidation under Sec. 762.149 
should begin.
    (vi) If a borrower is current on a loan, but will be unable to make 
a payment, a restructuring proposal may be submitted in accordance with 
Sec. 762.145 prior to the payment coming due.
    (c) PLP lenders will service defaulted loans according to their 
lender's agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 762.144  Repurchase of guaranteed portion from a secondary market
holder.

    (a) Request for repurchase. The holder may request the lender to 
repurchase the unpaid guaranteed portion of the loan when:
    (1) The borrower has not made a payment of principal and interest 
due on the loan for at least 60 days; or
    (2) The lender has failed to remit to the holder its pro-rata share 
of any payment made by the borrower within 30 days of receipt of a 
payment.
    (b) Repurchase by the lender. (1) When a lender is requested to 
repurchase a loan from the holder, the lender must consider the request 
according to the servicing actions that are necessary on the loan. In 
order to facilitate servicing and simplified accounting of loan 
transactions, lenders are encouraged to repurchase the loan upon the 
holder's request.
    (2) The repurchase by the lender will be for an amount equal to the 
portion of the loan held by the holder plus accrued interest.
    (3) The guarantee will not cover separate servicing fees that the 
lender accrues after the repurchase.
    (c) Repurchase by the Agency. (1) If the lender does not repurchase 
the loan, the holder must inform the Agency in writing that demand was 
made on the lender and the lender refused. Following the lender's 
refusal, the holder may continue as holder of the guaranteed portion of 
the loan or request that the Agency purchase the guaranteed portion. 
Within 30 days after written demand to the Agency from the holder with 
required attachments, the Agency will forward to the holder payment of 
the unpaid principal balance, with accrued interest to the date of 
repurchase. If the holder does not desire repurchase or purchase of a 
defaulted loan, the lender must forward the holder its pro-rata share of 
payments, liquidation proceeds and Agency loss payments.
    (2) With its demand on the Agency, the holder must include:
    (i) A copy of the written demand made upon the lender.
    (ii) Originals of the guarantee and note properly endorsed to the 
Agency, or the original of the assignment of guarantee.
    (iii) A copy of any written response to the demand of the holder by 
the lender.
    (iv) An account to which the Agency can forward the purchase amount 
via electronic funds transfer.
    (3) The amount due the holder from the Agency includes unpaid 
principal, unpaid interest to the date of demand, and interest which has 
accrued from the date of demand to the proposed payment date.
    (i) Upon request by the Agency, the lender must furnish upon Agency 
request a current statement, certified by a bank officer, of the unpaid 
principal and interest owed by the borrower and the amount due the 
holder.
    (ii) Any discrepancy between the amount claimed by the holder and 
the information submitted by the lender must be resolved by the lender 
and the holder before payment will be approved by the Agency. The Agency 
will not participate in resolution of any such discrepancy. When there 
is a discrepancy, the 30 day Agency payment requirement to the holder 
will be suspended until the discrepancy is resolved.
    (iii) In the case of a request for Agency purchase, the Agency will 
only pay interest that accrues for up to 90 days from the date of the 
demand letter to the lender requesting the repurchase.

[[Page 112]]

However, if the holder requested repurchase from the Agency within 60 
days of the request to the lender and for any reason not attributable to 
the holder and the lender, the Agency cannot make payment within 30 days 
of the holder's demand to the Agency, the holder will be entitled to 
interest to the date of payment.
    (4) At the time of purchase by the Agency, the original assignment 
of guarantee will be assigned by the holder to the Agency without 
recourse, including all rights, title, and interest in the loan.
    (5) Purchase by the Agency does not change, alter, or modify any of 
the lender's obligations to the Agency specified in the lender's 
agreement or guarantee; nor does the purchase waive any of the Agency's 
rights against the lender.
    (6) The Agency succeeds to all rights of the holder under the 
Guarantee including the right of set-off against the lender.
    (7) Within 180 days of the Agency's purchase, the lender will 
reimburse the Agency the amount of repurchase, with accrued interest, 
through one of the following ways:
    (i) By liquidating the loan security and paying the Agency its pro-
rata share of liquidation proceeds; or
    (ii) Paying the Agency the full amount the Agency paid to the holder 
plus any accrued interest.
    (8) The lender will be liable for the purchase amount and any 
expenses incurred by the Agency to maintain the loan in its portfolio or 
liquidate the security. While the Agency holds the guaranteed portion of 
the loan, the lender will transmit to the Agency any payment received 
from the borrower, including the pro-rata share of liquidation or other 
proceeds.
    (9) If the borrower files for reorganization under the provisions of 
the bankruptcy code or pays the account current while the purchase by 
the Government is being processed, the Agency may hold the loan as long 
it determines this action to be in the Agency's interest. If the lender 
is not proceeding expeditiously to collect the loan or reimbursement is 
not waived under this paragraph, the Agency will demand payment by the 
lender and collect the purchase amount through administrative offset of 
any claims due the lender.
    (10) The Agency may sell a purchased guaranteed loan on a non-
recourse basis if it determines that selling the portion of the loan 
that it holds is in the Government's best interest. A non-recourse 
purchase from the Agency requires a written request to the Agency from 
the party that wishes to purchase it, and written concurrence from the 
lender;
    (d) Repurchase for servicing. (1) If, due to loan default or 
imminent loan restructuring, the lender determines that repurchase is 
necessary to adequately service the loan, the lender may repurchase the 
guaranteed portion of the loan from the holder, with the written 
approval of the Agency.
    (2) The lender will not repurchase from the holder for arbitrage 
purposes. With its request for Agency concurrence, the lender will 
notify the Agency of its plans to resell the guaranteed portion 
following servicing.
    (3) The holder will sell the guaranteed portion of the loan to the 
lender for an amount agreed to between the lender and holder.

<R05>
Sec. 762.145  Restructuring guaranteed loans.

    (a) General. (1) To restructure guaranteed loans standard eligible 
lenders must:
    (i) Obtain prior written approval of the Agency for all 
restructuring actions; and,
    (ii) Provide the items in paragraph (b) and (e) of this section to 
the Agency for approval.
    (2) If the standard eligible lender's proposal for servicing is not 
agreed to by the Agency, the Agency approval official will notify the 
lender in writing within 14 days of the lender's request.
    (3) To restructure guaranteed loans CLP lenders must:
    (i) Obtain prior written approval of the Agency only for debt write 
down under this section.
    (ii) Submit all calculations required in paragraph (e) of this 
section for debt writedown.

[[Page 113]]

    (iii) For restructuring other than write down, provide FSA with a 
certification that each requirement of this section has been met, a 
narrative outlining the circumstances surrounding the need for 
restructuring, and copies of any applicable calculations.
    (4) PLP lenders will restructure loans in accordance with their 
lender's agreement.
    (5) All lenders will submit copies of any restructured notes or 
lines of credit to the Agency.
    (b) Requirements. For any restructuring action, the following 
conditions apply:
    (1) The borrower meets the eligibility criteria of Sec. 762.120, 
except the provisions regarding prior debt forgiveness and delinquency 
on a federal debt do not apply.
    (2) The borrower's ability to make the amended payment is documented 
by the following:
    (i) A feasible plan (see Sec. 762.102(b)). If interest assistance 
is required to achieve a feasible plan, the items required by Sec. 
762.150(d) must be submitted with a restructuring request. Feasible plan 
is defined in Sec. 762.102(b).
    (ii) Current financial statements from all liable parties.
    (iii) Verification of nonfarm income.
    (iv) Verification of all debts of $1,000 or more.
    (v) Applicable credit reports.
    (vi) Financial history (and production history for standard eligible 
lenders) for the past 3 years to support the cash flow projections.
    (3) A final loss claim may be reduced, adjusted, or rejected as a 
result of negligent servicing after the concurrence with a restructuring 
action under this section.
    (4) Loans secured by real estate and/or equipment can be 
restructured using a balloon payment, equal installments, or unequal 
installments. Under no circumstances may livestock or crops alone be 
used as security for a loan to be rescheduled using a balloon payment. 
If a balloon payment is used, the projected value of the real estate 
and/or equipment security must indicate that the loan will be fully 
secured when the balloon payment becomes due. The projected value will 
be derived from a current appraisal adjusted for depreciation of 
depreciable property, such as buildings and other improvements, that 
occurs until the balloon payment is due. For equipment security, a 
current appraisal is required. The lender is required to project the 
security value of the equipment at the time the balloon payment is due 
based on the remaining life of the equipment, or the depreciation 
schedule on the borrower's Federal income tax return. Loans restructured 
with a balloon payment that are secured by real estate will have a 
minimum term of 5 years, and other loans will have a minimum term of 3 
years before the scheduled balloon payment. If statutory limits on terms 
of loans prevent the minimum terms, balloon payments may not be used. If 
the loan is rescheduled with unequal installments, a feasible plan, as 
defined in Sec. 762.102(b), must be projected for when installments are 
scheduled to increase.
    (5) If a borrower is current on a loan, but will be unable to make a 
payment, a restructuring proposal may be submitted prior to the payment 
coming due.
    (6) The lender may capitalize the outstanding interest when 
restructuring the loan as follows:
    (i) As a result of the capitalization of interest, a rescheduled 
promissory note may increase the amount of principal the borrower is 
required to pay. However, in no case will such principal amount exceed 
the statutory loan limits contained in Sec. 761.8 of this chapter.
    (ii) When accrued interest causes the loan amount to exceed the 
statutory loan limits, rescheduling may be approved without 
capitalization of the amount that exceeds the limit. Noncapitalized 
interest may be scheduled for repayment over the term of the rescheduled 
note.
    (iii) Only interest that has accrued at the rate indicated on the 
borrower's original promissory notes may be capitalized. Late payment 
fees or default interest penalties that have accrued due to the 
borrower's failure to make payments as agreed are not covered under the 
guarantee and may not be capitalized.
    (iv) The Agency will execute a modification of guarantee form to 
identify

[[Page 114]]

the new loan principal and the guaranteed portion if greater than the 
original loan amounts, and to waive the restriction on capitalization of 
interest, if applicable, to the existing guarantee documents. The 
modification form will be attached to the original guarantee as an 
addendum.
    (v) Approved capitalized interest will be treated as part of the 
principal and interest that accrues thereon, in the event that a loss 
should occur.
    (7) The lender's security position will not be adversely affected 
because of the restructuring. New security instruments may be taken if 
needed, but a loan does not have to be fully secured in order to be 
restructured, unless it is restructured with a balloon payment. When a 
loan is restructured using a balloon payment the lender must take a lien 
on all assets and project the loan to be fully secured at the time the 
balloon payment becomes due, in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this 
section.
    (8) Any holder agrees in writing to any changes in the original loan 
terms, including the approval of interest assistance. If the holder does 
not agree, the lender must repurchase the loan from the holder for any 
loan restructuring to occur.
    (9) After a guaranteed loan is restructured, the lender must provide 
the Agency with a copy of the restructured promissory note.
    (c) Rescheduling. The following conditions apply when a guaranteed 
loan is rescheduled or reamortized:
    (1) Payments will be rescheduled within the following terms:
    (i) FO and existing SW may be amortized over the remaining term of 
the note or rescheduled with an uneven payment schedule. The maturity 
date cannot exceed 40 years from the date of the original note.
    (ii) OL notes must be rescheduled over a period not to exceed 15 
years from the date of the rescheduling. An OL line of credit may be 
rescheduled over a period not to exceed 7 years from the date of the 
rescheduling or 10 years from the date of the original note, whichever 
is less. Advances cannot be made against a line of credit loan that has 
had any portion of the loan rescheduled.
    (2) The interest rate for a rescheduled loan is the negotiated rate 
agreed upon by the lender and the borrower at the time of the action, 
subject to the loan limitations for each type of loan.
    (3) A new note is not necessary when rescheduling occurs. However, 
if a new note is not taken, the existing note or line of credit 
agreement must be modified by attaching an allonge or other legally 
effective amendment, evidencing the revised repayment schedule and any 
interest rate change. If a new note is taken, the new note must 
reference the old note and state that the indebtedness evidenced by the 
old note or line of credit agreement is not satisfied. The original note 
or line of credit agreement must be retained.
    (d) Deferrals. The following conditions apply to deferrals:
    (1) Payments may be deferred up to 5 years, but the loan may not be 
extended beyond the final due date of the note.
    (2) The principal portion of the payment may be deferred either in 
whole or in part.
    (3) Interest may be deferred only in part. Payment of a reasonable 
portion of accruing interest as indicated by the borrower's cash flow 
projections is required for multi-year deferrals.
    (4) There must be a reasonable prospect that the borrower will be 
able to resume full payments at the end of the deferral period.
    (e) Debt writedown. The following conditions apply to debt 
writedown:
    (1) A lender may only write down a delinquent guaranteed loan or 
line of credit in an amount sufficient to permit the borrower to develop 
a feasible plan as defined in Sec. 762.102(b).
    (2) The lender will request other creditors to negotiate their debts 
before a writedown is considered.
    (3) The borrower cannot develop a feasible plan after consideration 
is given to rescheduling and deferral under this section.
    (4) The present value of the loan to be written down, based on the 
interest rate of the rescheduled loan, will be equal to or exceed the 
net recovery value of the loan collateral.
    (5) The loan will be restructured with regular payments at terms no 
shorter than 5 years for a line of credit and OL

[[Page 115]]

note and no shorter than 20 years for FO, unless required to be shorter 
by Sec. 762.145(c)(1)(i) and (ii).
    (6) No further advances may be made on a line of credit that is 
written down.
    (7) Loans may not be written down with interest assistance. If a 
borrower's loan presently on interest assistance requires a writedown, 
the writedown will be considered without interest assistance.
    (8) The writedown is based on writing down the shorter-term loans 
first.
    (9) When a lender requests approval of a writedown for a borrower 
with multiple loans, the security for all of the loans will be cross-
collateralized and continue to serve as security for the loan that is 
written down. If a borrower has multiple loans and one loan is written 
off entirely through debt writedown, the security for that loan will not 
be released and will remain as security for the other written down debt. 
Additional security instruments will be taken if required to cross-
collateralize security and maintain lien priority.
    (10) The writedown will be evidenced by an allonge or amendment to 
the existing note or line of credit reflecting the writedown.
    (11) The borrower executes an Agency shared appreciation agreement 
for loans which are written down and secured by real estate.
    (i) The lender will attach the original agreement to the 
restructured loan document.
    (ii) The lender will provide the Agency a copy of the executed 
agreement, and
    (iii) Security instruments must ensure future collection of any 
appreciation under the agreement.
    (12) The lender will prepare and submit the following to the Agency:
    (i) A current appraisal of all security in accordance with Sec. 
762.127.
    (ii) A completed report of loss on the appropriate Agency form for 
the proposed writedown loss claim.
    (iii) Detailed writedown calculations as follows:
    (A) Calculate the present value.
    (B) Determine the net recovery value.
    (C) If the net recovery value exceeds the present value, writedown 
is unavailable; liquidation becomes the next servicing consideration. If 
the present value equals or exceeds the net recovery value, the debt may 
be written down to the present value.
    (iv) The lender will make any adjustment in the calculations as 
requested by the Agency.

Sec. 762.146  Other servicing procedures.

    (a) Additional loans and advances. (1) Notwithstanding any provision 
of this section, the PLP lender may make additional loans or advances in 
accordance with the lender's agreement with the Agency.
    (2) SEL and CLP lenders must not make additional loans or advances 
without prior written approval of the Agency, except as provided in the 
borrower's loan or line of credit agreement.
    (3) In cases of a guaranteed line of credit, lenders may make an 
emergency advance when a line of credit has reached its ceiling. The 
emergency advance will be made as an advance under the line and not as a 
separate note. The lender's loan documents must contain sufficient 
language to provide that any emergency advance will constitute a debt of 
the borrower to the lender and be secured by the security instrument. 
The following conditions apply:
    (i) The loan funds to be advanced are for authorized operating loan 
purposes;
    (ii) The financial benefit to the lender and the Government from the 
advance will exceed the amount of the advance; and
    (iii) The loss of crops or livestock is imminent unless the advance 
is made.
    (4) Protective advance requirements are found in Sec. 762.149.
    (b) Release of liability upon withdrawal. An individual who is 
obligated on a guaranteed loan may be released from liability by a 
lender, with the written consent of the Agency, provided the following 
conditions have been met:
    (1) The individual to be released has withdrawn from the farming or 
ranching operation;

[[Page 116]]

    (2) A divorce decree or final property settlement does not hold the 
withdrawing party responsible for the loan payments;
    (3) The withdrawing party's interest in the security is conveyed to 
the individual or entity with whom the loan will be continued;
    (4) The ratio of the amount of debt to the value of the remaining 
security is less than or equal to .75, or the withdrawing party has no 
income or assets from which collection can be made; and
    (5) Withdrawal of the individual does not result in legal 
dissolution of the entity to which the loans are made. Individually 
liable members of a general or limited partnership may not be released 
from liability.
    (6) The remaining liable party projects a feasible plan (see Sec. 
762.102(b)).
    (c) Release of liability after liquidation. After a final loss claim 
has been paid on the borrower's account, the lender may release the 
borrower or guarantor from liability if;
    (1) The Agency agrees to the release in writing;
    (2) The lender documents its consideration of the following factors 
concerning the borrower or guarantors:
    (i) The likelihood that the borrower or guarantor will have a 
sufficient level of income in the reasonably near future to contribute 
to a meaningful reduction of the debt;
    (ii) The prospect that the borrower or guarantor will inherit assets 
in the near term that may be attached by the Agency for payment of a 
significant portion of the debt;
    (iii) Whether collateral has been properly accounted for, and 
whether liability should be retained in order to take action against the 
borrower or a third party for conversion of security;
    (iv) The availability of other income or assets which are not 
security;
    (v) The possibility that assets have been concealed or improperly 
transferred;
    (vi) The effect of other guarantors on the loan; and
    (vii) Cash consideration or other collateral in exchange for the 
release of liability.
    (3) The lender will use its own release of liability documents.
    (d) Interest rate changes. (1) The lender may change the interest 
rate on a performing (nondelinquent) loan only with the borrower's 
consent.
    (2) If the loan has been sold on the secondary market, the lender 
must repurchase the loan or obtain the holder's written consent.
    (3) To change a fixed rate of interest to a variable rate of 
interest or vice versa, the lender and the borrower must execute a 
legally effective allonge or amendment to the existing note.
    (4) If a new note is taken, it will be attached to and refer to the 
original note.
    (5) The lender will inform the Agency of the rate change.
    (e) Consolidation. Two or more Agency guaranteed loans may be 
consolidated, subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The borrower must project a feasible plan after the 
consolidation. See Sec. 762.102(b) for definition of feasible plan.
    (2) Only OL may be consolidated.
    (3) Existing lines of credit may only be consolidated with a new 
line of credit if the final maturity date and conditions for advances of 
the new line of credit are made the same as the existing line of credit.
    (4) Guaranteed OL may not be consolidated with a line of credit, 
even if the line of credit has been rescheduled.
    (5) Guaranteed loans made prior to October 1, 1991, cannot be 
consolidated with those loans made on or after October 1, 1991.
    (6) OL secured by real estate or with an outstanding interest 
assistance agreement or shared appreciation agreement cannot be 
consolidated.
    (7) A new note or line of credit agreement will be taken. The new 
note or line of credit agreement must describe the note or line of 
credit agreement being consolidated and must state that the indebtedness 
evidenced by the note or line of credit agreement is not satisfied. The 
original note or line of credit agreement must be retained.
    (8) The interest rate for a consolidated OL loan is the negotiated 
rate agreed upon by the lender and the borrower at the time of the 
action, subject

[[Page 117]]

to the loan limitations for each type of loan.
    (9) The Agency approves the consolidation by executing a 
modification of guarantee. The modification will indicate the 
consolidated loan amount, new terms, and percentage of guarantee, and 
will be attached to the originals of the guarantees being consolidated. 
If loans with a different guarantee percentage are consolidated, the new 
guarantee will be at the lowest percentage of guarantee being 
consolidated
    (10) Any holders must consent to the consolidation, or the 
guaranteed portion must be repurchased by the lender.

    (b) Recapture. (1) Recapture of any appreciation of real estate 
security will take place at the end of the term of the agreement, or 
sooner if the following occurs:
    (i) On the conveyance of the real estate security (or a portion 
thereof) by the borrower.
    (A) If only a portion of the real estate is conveyed, recapture will 
only be triggered against the portion conveyed. Partial releases will be 
handled in accordance with Sec. 762.141(b).
    (B) Transfer of title to the spouse of the borrower on the death of 
such borrower will not be treated as a conveyance under the agreement.
    (ii) On repayment of the loan; or
    (iii) If the borrower ceases farming.
    (2) Calculating recapture.
    (i) The amount of recapture will be based on the difference between 
the value of the security at the time recapture is triggered and the 
value of the security at the time of writedown, as shown on the shared 
appreciation agreement.
    (ii) Security values will be determined through appraisals obtained 
by the lender and meeting the requirements of Sec. 762.127.
    (iii) All appraisal fees will be paid by the lender.

shown on the shared appreciation agreement.
    (v) If recapture is triggered within 4 years of the date of the 
shared appreciation agreement, the lender shall recapture 75 percent of 
any positive appreciation in the market value of the property securing 
the loan or line of credit agreement.
    (vi) If recapture is triggered after 4 years from the date of the 
shared appreciation agreement, the lender shall recapture 50 percent of 
any positive appreciation in the market value of the property securing 
the loan or line of credit agreement.
    (3) Servicing recapture debt.
    (i) If recapture is triggered under the shared appreciation 
agreement and the borrower is unable to pay the recapture in a lump sum, 
the lender may:
    (A) Reschedule the recapture debt with the consent of the Agency,

amortized payments on the recapture debt, plus pay all other 
obligations. In such case, the recapture debt will not be covered by the

    (B) Pay the Agency its pro rata share of the recapture due. In such 
case, the recapture debt of the borrower will be covered by the 
guarantee; or
    (C) Service the account in accordance with Sec. 762.149.
    (ii) If recapture is triggered, and the borrower is able but 
unwilling to pay the recapture in a lump sum, the lender will service 
the account in accordance with Sec. 762.149.
    (4) Paying the Agency. Any shared appreciation recaptured by the 
lender will be shared on a pro-rata basis between the lender and the 
Agency.

of the proceedings.
    (i) The lender will submit a default status report when the borrower 
defaults and every 60 days until the default is resolved or a final loss 
claim is paid.
    (ii) The default status report will be used to inform the Agency of 
the bankruptcy filing, the reorganization plan confirmation date and 
effective date, when the reorganization plan is complete, and when the 
borrower is not in compliance with the reorganization plan.
    (b) Bankruptcy expenses. (1) Reorganization.
    (i) Expenses, such as legal fees and the cost of appraisals incurred 
by the lender as a direct result of the borrower's chapter 11, 12, or 13 
reorganization, are covered under the guarantee, provided they are 
reasonable, customary, and provide a demonstrated economic benefit to 
the lender and the Agency.
    (ii) Lender's in-house expenses, which are those expenses which 
would normally be incurred for administration of the loan, including in-
house lawyers, are not covered by the guarantee.
    (2) Liquidation expenses in bankruptcy.
    (i) Reasonable and customary liquidation expenses may be deducted 
from the proceeds of the collateral in liquidation bankruptcy cases.
    (ii) In-house expenses are not considered customary liquidation

claim, and any additional information requested by the Agency, including 
justification for the legal fees included on the claim.
    (iii) The estimated loss payment may be revised as consistent with a 
court-approved reorganization plan.
    (iv) Protective advances made and approved in accordance with Sec. 
762.149 may be included in an estimated loss claim associated with a

    (A) They were incurred in connection with the initiation of 
liquidation action prior to bankruptcy filing; or
    (B) The advance is required to provide repairs, insurance, etc. to 
protect the collateral as a result of delays in the case, or failure of

    (2) Interest only losses. The lender may submit an estimated loss 
claim for interest only after confirmation of the reorganization plan in 
accordance with the following:
    (i) The loss claims may cover interest losses sustained as a result

the same date, beyond the period of the reorganization plan.
    (3) Actual loss.
    (i) Once the reorganization plan is complete, the lender will 
provide the Agency with documentation of the actual loss sustained.
    (ii) If the actual loss sustained is greater than the prior 
estimated loss payment, the lender may submit a revised estimated loss 
claim to obtain payment of the additional amount owed by the Agency 
under the guarantee.
    (iii) If the actual loss is less than the prior estimated loss, the 
lender will reimburse the Agency for the overpayment plus interest at 
the note rate from the date of the payment of the estimated loss.
    (4) Payment to holder. In reorganization bankruptcy, if a holder 
makes demand upon the Agency, the Agency will pay the holder interest to 
the plan's effective date. Accruing interest thereafter will be based 
upon the provisions of the reorganization plan.
    (d) Liquidation under the bankruptcy code. (1) Upon receipt of 
notification that a borrower has filed for protection under Chapter 7 of 
the bankruptcy code, or a liquidation plan under chapter 11, the lender 
must proceed according to the liquidation procedures of this part. For 
purposes of calculating the time frames required under Sec. 762.149 of 
this part, for a borrower who is or will be liquidated, the date the 
borrower files for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 7 shall be the 
date of the decision to liquidate.
    (2) If the property is abandoned by the trustee, the lender will 
conduct the liquidation according to Sec. 762.149.
    (3) Proceeds received from partial sale of collateral during 
bankruptcy may be used by the lender to pay reasonable costs, such as 
freight, labor and sales commissions, associated with the partial sale. 
Reasonable use of proceeds for this purpose must be documented with the 
final loss claim in accordance with Sec. 762.149(a)(vi).

<R05>
Sec. 762.149  Liquidation.

    (a) Mediation. When it has been determined that default cannot be 
cured through any of the servicing options available, or if the lender 
does not wish to utilize any of the authorities provided in this part, 
the lender must:
    (1) Participate in mediation according to the rules and regulations 
of any State which has a mandatory farmer-creditor mediation program;
    (2) Consider private mediation services in those States which do not 
have a mandatory farmer-creditor mediation program; and
    (3) Not agree to any proposals to rewrite the terms of a guaranteed 
loan which do not comply with this part. Any agreements reached as a 
result of mediation involving defaults and or loan restructuring must 
have written concurrence from the Agency before they are implemented.
    (b) Liquidation plan. If a default cannot be cured after considering 
servicing options and mediation, the lender will proceed with 
liquidation of the collateral in accordance with the following:
    (1) Within 30 days of the decision to liquidate, standard eligible 
and CLP lenders will submit a written liquidation plan to the Agency 
which includes:
    (i) Current balance sheets from all liable parties or, if the 
parties are not cooperative, the best information available, or in 
liquidation bankruptcies, a copy of the bankruptcy schedules or 
discharge notice;
    (ii) A proposed method of maximizing the collection of debt which 
includes specific plans to collect any remaining loan balances on the 
guaranteed loan after loan collateral has been liquidated, including 
possibilities for judgment;
    (A) If the borrower has converted loan security, the lender will 
determine whether litigation is cost effective. The lender must address, 
in the liquidation plan, whether civil or criminal action will be 
pursued. If the lender does not pursue the recovery, the reason must be 
documented when an estimated loss claim is submitted.
    (B) Any proposal to release the borrower from liability will be 
addressed in the liquidation plan in accordance with Sec. 
762.146(c)(2);

[[Page 120]]

    (iii) An independent appraisal report on all collateral securing the 
loan that meets the requirements of Sec. 762.127 and a calculation of 
the net recovery value of the security as defined in Sec. 762.102. The 
appraisal requirement may be waived by the Agency in the following 
cases:
    (A) The bankruptcy trustee is handling the liquidation and the 
lender has submitted the trustee's determination of value;
    (B) The lender's proposed method of liquidation rarely results in 
receipt of less than market value for livestock and used equipment; or
    (C) A purchase offer has already been received for more than the 
debt;
    (iv) An estimate of time necessary to complete the liquidation;
    (v) An estimated loss claim if the liquidation period is expected to 
exceed 90 days.
    (vi) An estimate of reasonable liquidation expenses; and
    (vii) An estimate of any protective advances.
    (2) PLP lenders will submit a liquidation plan as required by their 
lender's agreement.
    (c) Agency approval of the liquidation plan. (1) CLP lender's or 
standard eligible lender's liquidation plan, and any revisions of the 
plan, must be approved by the Agency.
    (2) If, within 20 calendar days of the Agency's receipt of the 
liquidation plan, the Agency fails to approve it or fails to request 
that the lender make revisions, the lender may assume the plan is 
approved. The lender may then proceed to begin liquidation actions at 
its discretion as long as it has been at least 60 days since the 
borrower's eligibility for interest assistance was considered.
    (3) At its option, the Agency may liquidate the guaranteed loan as 
follows:
    (i) Upon Agency request, the lender will transfer to the Agency all 
rights and interests necessary to allow the Agency to liquidate the 
loan. The Agency will not pay the lender for any loss until after the 
collateral is liquidated and the final loss is determined; and
    (ii) If the Agency conducts the liquidation, interest accrual will 
cease on the date the Agency notifies the lender in writing that it 
assumes responsibility for the liquidation.
    (d) Estimated loss claims. An estimated loss claim will be submitted 
by the lender with the liquidation plan if the liquidation is expected 
to exceed 90 days. The estimated loss will be based on the following:
    (1) The Agency will pay the lender the guaranteed percentage of the 
total outstanding debt, less the net recovery value of the remaining 
security, less any unaccounted for security; and
    (2) The lender generally will discontinue interest accrual on the 
defaulted loan at the time the estimated loss claim is paid by the 
Agency. The following exceptions apply:
    (i) If the lender estimates that there will be no loss after 
considering the costs of liquidation, interest accrual will cease 90 
days after the decision to liquidate,
    (ii) In the case of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, in cases where the 
lender filed an estimated loss claim, the Agency will pay the lender 
interest which accrues during and up to 45 days after the date of 
discharge on the portion of the chattel only secured debt that was 
estimated to be secured but upon final liquidation was found to be 
unsecured, and up to 90 days after the date of discharge on the portion 
of real estate secured debt that was estimated to be secured but was 
found to be unsecured upon final disposition,
    (iii) The Agency will pay the lender interest which accrues during 
and up to 90 days after the time period the lender is unable to dispose 
of acquired property due to state imposed redemption rights on any 
unsecured portion of the loan during the redemption period, if an 
estimated loss claim was paid by the Agency during the liquidation 
action.
    (3) Packager fees and outside consultant fees for servicing of 
guaranteed loans are not covered by the guarantee, and will not be paid 
in an estimated loss claim.
    (e) Protective advances. (1) Prior written authorization from the 
Agency is required for all protective advances in excess of $5,000 for 
CLP lenders and $3,000 for standard eligible lenders. The dollar amount 
of protective advances

[[Page 121]]

allowed for PLP lenders will be specified when PLP status is awarded by 
the Agency or as contained in the lender's agreement.
    (2) The lender may claim recovery for the guaranteed portion of any 
loss of monies advanced as protective advances as allowed in this part, 
plus interest that accrues on the protective advances.
    (3) Payment for protective advances is made by the Agency when the 
final loss claim is approved, except in bankruptcy actions.
    (4) Protective advances are used only when the borrower is in 
liquidation, liquidation is imminent, or when the lender has taken title 
to real property in a liquidation action.
    (5) Legal fees are not a protective advance.
    (6) Protective advances may only be made when the lender can 
demonstrate the advance is in the best interest of the lender and the 
Agency.
    (7) Protective advances must constitute a debt of the borrower to 
the lender and be secured by the security instrument.
    (8) Protective advances must not be made in lieu of additional 
loans.
    (f) Unapproved loans or advances. The amount of any payments made by 
the borrower on unapproved loans or advances outside of the guarantee 
will be deducted from any loss claim submitted by the lender on the 
guaranteed loan, if that loan or advance was paid prior to, and to the 
detriment of, the guaranteed loan.
    (g) Acceleration. (1) If the borrower is not in bankruptcy, the 
lender shall send the borrower notice that the loan is in default and 
the entire debt has been determined due and payable immediately after 
other servicing options have been exhausted.
    (2) The loan cannot be accelerated until after the borrower has been 
considered for interest assistance and the conclusion of mandatory 
mediation in accordance with Sec. 762.149.
    (3) The lender will submit a copy of the acceleration notice or 
other document to the Agency.
    (h) Foreclosure. (1) The lender is responsible for determining the 
necessary parties to any foreclosure action, or who should be named on a 
deed of conveyance taken in lieu of foreclosure.
    (2) When the property is liquidated, the lender will apply the net 
proceeds to the guaranteed loan debt.
    (3) When it is necessary to enter a bid at a foreclosure sale, the 
lender may bid the amount that it determines is reasonable to protect 
its and the Agency's interest. At a minimum, the lender will bid the 
lesser of the net recovery value or the unpaid guaranteed loan balance.
    (i) Final loss claims. (1) Lenders may submit a final loss claim 
when the security has been liquidated and all proceeds have been 
received and applied to the account.
    (2) If a lender acquires title to property either through voluntary 
conveyance or foreclosure proceeding, the lender will submit a final 
loss claim after disposing of the property. The lender may pay 
reasonable maintenance expenses to protect the value of the property 
while it is owned by the lender. These may be paid as protective 
advances or deducted as liquidation expenses from the sales proceeds 
when the lender disposes of the property. The lender must obtain Agency 
written concurrence before incurring maintenance expenses which exceed 
the amounts allowed in Sec. 762.149(e)(1). Packager fees and outside 
consultant fees for servicing of guaranteed loans are not covered by the 
guarantee, and will not be paid in a final loss claim.
    (3) The lender will make its records available to the Agency for the 
Agency's audit of the propriety of any loss payment.
    (4) All lenders will submit the following documents with a final 
loss claim:
    (i) An accounting of the use of loan funds;
    (ii) An accounting of the disposition of loan security and its 
proceeds;
    (iii) A copy of the loan ledger indicating loan advances, interest 
rate changes, protective advances, and application of payments, rental 
proceeds, and security proceeds, including a running outstanding balance 
total; and
    (iv) Documentation, as requested by the Agency, concerning the 
lender's compliance with the requirements of this part.

[[Page 122]]

    (5) The Agency will notify the lender of any discrepancies in the 
final loss claim or, approve or reject the claim within 40 days.
    (6) The Agency will reduce a final loss claim based on its 
calculation of the dollar amount of loss caused by the lender's 
negligent servicing of the account. Loss claims may be reduced or 
rejected as a result of the following:
    (i) A loss claim may be reduced by the amount caused by the lender's 
failure to secure property after a default, and will be reduced by the 
amount of interest that accrues when the lender fails to contact the 
borrower or takes no action to cure the default, once it occurs. Losses 
incurred as a result of interest accrual during excessive delays in 
collection, as determined by the Agency, will not be paid.
    (ii) Unauthorized release of security proceeds, failure to verify 
ownership or possession of security to be purchased, or failure to 
inspect collateral as often required so as to ensure its maintenance.
    (7) Losses will not be reduced for the following:
    (i) Servicing deficiencies that did not contribute materially to the 
dollar amount of the loss.
    (ii) Unaccounted security, as long as the lender's efforts to locate 
and recover the missing collateral was equal to that which would have 
been expended in the case of an unguaranteed loan in the lender's 
portfolio.
    (8) Default interest, late charges, and loan servicing fees are not 
payable under the loss claim.
    (9) The final loss will be the remaining outstanding balance after 
application of the estimated loss payment and the application of 
proceeds from the liquidation of the security.
    (10) If the final loss is less than the estimated loss, the lender 
will reimburse the Agency for the overpayment, plus interest at the note 
rate from the date of the estimated loss payment.
    (11) The lender will return the original guarantee marked paid after 
receipt of a final loss claim.
    (j) Future Recovery. The lender will remit any recoveries made on 
the account after the Agency's payment of a final loss claim to the 
Agency in proportion to the percentage of guarantee, in accordance with 
the lender's agreement, until the account is paid in full or otherwise 
satisfied.
    (k) Overpayments. The lender will repay any final loss overpayment 
determined by the Agency upon request.
    (l) Electronic funds transfer. The lender will designate one or more 
financial institutions to which any Agency payments will be made via 
electronic funds transfer.
    (m) Establishment of Federal debt. Any amounts paid by the Agency on 
account of liabilities of the guaranteed loan borrower will constitute a 
Federal debt owing to the Agency by the guaranteed loan borrower. In 
such case, the Agency may use all remedies available to it, including 
offset under the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, to collect the 
debt from the borrower. Interest charges will be established at the note 
rate of the guaranteed loan on the date the final loss claim is paid.

Sec. 762.150  Interest assistance program.

    (a) Requests for interest assistance. (1) To apply for interest 
assistance in conjunction with a new request for guarantee, the lender 
will submit the following:
    (i) A completed cash flow budget and interest assistance needs 
analysis portion of the application form. Interest assistance can be 
applied to each loan, only to one loan or any distribution the lender 
selects; however, interest assistance is only available on as many loans 
as necessary to achieve a feasible plan.
    (ii) For loans with unequal payments, a proposed debt repayment 
schedule which shows principal and interest payments for the subject 
loan, in each year of the loan.
    (2) To request interest assistance on an existing guaranteed loan, 
the lender must submit to the Agency the following:
    (i) A completed cash flow projection and interest assistance needs 
analysis portion of the application form. Interest assistance can be 
applied to each loan, only to one loan or any distribution the lender 
selects as required to achieve a feasible plan.

[[Page 123]]

    (ii) For loans with unequal payments, a proposed debt repayment 
schedule which shows scheduled payments for the subject loan in each of 
the remaining years of the loan.
    (iii) Cash flow budgets and supporting justification to document 
that the request meets the requirements outlined in paragraph (b) of 
this section. This will include a typical cash flow if the projected 
cash flow budget is atypical.
    (3) Requests for interest assistance on lines of credit or loans 
made for annual operating purposes must be accompanied by a projected 
monthly cash flow budget.
    (b) Requirements. (1) The typical term of scheduled loan repayment 
will not be reduced solely for the purpose of maximizing eligibility for 
interest assistance. To be eligible for interest assistance, a loan must 
be scheduled over the maximum terms typically used by lenders for 
similar type loans within the limits set by Sec. 762.124 of this part. 
At a minimum, loans will be scheduled for repayment over the terms 
listed below, but for OL not to exceed the life of the security:
    (i) An OL for the purpose of providing annual operating and living 
expenses will be scheduled for repayment when the income is scheduled to 
be received from the sale of the crops, livestock, and livestock 
products which will serve as security for the loan.
    (ii) OL for purposes other than annual operating and living expenses 
(i.e. equipment, livestock, refinancing of existing debt) will be 
scheduled over 7 years from the effective date of the proposed interest 
assistance agreement.
    (iii) FO and SW secured by real estate will be scheduled for 20 
years from the closing date of the original note covered by the 
guarantee.
    (2) The lender must document that a feasible plan, as defined in 
Sec. 762.102(b), is not possible without reducing the interest rate on 
the borrower's loan and with the debt restructured over the term of 
repayment.
    (3) The lender must determine whether the borrower, including 
members of an entity, owns any significant assets that do not contribute 
directly to essential family living or farm operations. The lender must 
determine the market value of these assets and prepare a cash flow 
budget based on the assumption that the value of these assets will be 
used for debt reduction. If a feasible plan can then be achieved, the 
borrower is not eligible for interest assistance. All interest 
assistance calculations will be based on the cash flow budget which 
assumes that the assets will be sold.
    (4) A borrower's new guaranteed loan is eligible for interest 
assistance if all the following conditions are met:
    (i) The applicant needs interest assistance in order to achieve a 
feasible plan.
    (ii) If significant changes in the borrower's cash flow budget are 
anticipated after the initial 12 months, then the typical cash flow 
budget must demonstrate that the borrower will still have a feasible 
plan, following the anticipated changes, with or without interest 
assistance.
    (iii) If a feasible plan cannot be achieved, even with other 
creditors voluntarily adjusting their debts and with the interest 
assistance, the interest assistance request will not be approved.
    (5) An existing guaranteed loan is eligible for interest assistance 
if the borrower needs interest assistance to achieve a feasible plan as 
defined in Sec. 762.102(b), and the borrower meets the eligibility 
criteria of Sec. 762.120, except the provision regarding prior debt 
forgiveness. If a feasible plan cannot be achieved, even with other 
creditors voluntarily adjusting their debts and with the interest 
assistance, the interest assistance request will not be approved. If a 
borrower has multiple loans, interest assistance may be provided on one 
or each loan, as available, to the extent necessary to achieve a 
feasible plan.
    (6) The term of the interest assistance agreement under this section 
shall not exceed 10 years from the date of the first interest assistance 
agreement signed by the loan applicant, including entity members, or the 
outstanding term of the loan, as limited by this section, whichever is 
less.
    (7) The lender may charge a fixed or variable interest rate. The 
type of rate must be the same as the type of rate in the underlying note 
or line of credit agreement. The lender will reduce the

[[Page 124]]

interest rate charged the borrower's account by at least the amount of 
interest assistance.
    (8) The borrower must be an operator of not larger than a family 
size farm.
    (c) Interest assistance closing. (1) Initial guaranteed loans will 
be closed in accordance with Sec. 762.130.
    (2) The lender will then prepare and deliver to the Agency a closing 
report for each initial and existing guaranteed loan which has been 
granted interest assistance.
    (3) When all requirements have been met, the lender and the Agency 
will execute an interest assistance agreement.
    (d) Interest assistance claims and payments. (1) The interest 
assistance claim will be prepared by the lender. The following 
conditions apply to the claims process:
    (i) No claim period can exceed 12 months. The initial and final 
claim periods may be less than 12 months. In such claims, the 4 percent 
payment will be prorated over the number of months in the claim period. 
The period for all other claims must be 12 months.
    (ii) To permit the borrower to prepare for the upcoming year, a 
claim should be filed within 60 days of each anniversary date. Claims 
not filed within 1 year of the anniversary date will not be paid and the 
amount due the lender is permanently forfeited.
    (iii) If a claim is submitted without an interest assistance review 
in accordance with Sec. 762.102, when it is required, the claim will 
not be processed until the review is submitted by the lender.
    (iv) Upon full payment of the note or line of credit, the lender 
will immediately prepare the request for interest assistance payment and 
submit it to the Agency.
    (v) Interest assistance payments shall cease upon the assumption and 
transfer of the loan if the transferee was not liable for the debt on 
the effective date of the interest assistance agreement. The lender 
shall request payment through the date of the transfer or assumption. 
The claim must be submitted within 1 year or it will be denied and the 
payment permanently forfeited.
    (vi) All claims will be supported by detailed calculations of 
average daily principal balances during the claim period.
    (vii) The Agency will review the claim and the supporting 
documentation. If the information and the supporting documentation is 
not complete and correct, the reviewing official will notify the lender 
in writing, of the actions needed to correct the request.
    (viii) If there is a substitution of lender, a claim for the first 
lender's interest assistance, through the effective date of the 
substitution, will be submitted by the first lender and processed at the 
time of the substitution.
    (ix) Interest assistance claims shall be submitted concurrently with 
the submission of estimated loss claims where interest accrual ceases, 
or final loss claims that are not preceded by an estimated loss claim.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (e) Request for continuation of interest assistance. (1) For all 
interest assistance agreements exceeding 12 months, the lender will 
perform an analysis of the applicant's farming operation and need for 
continued interest assistance. The following information will be 
submitted to the Agency:
    (i) A summary of the operation's actual financial performance in the 
previous year, including a detailed income and expense statement.
    (ii) A narrative description of the causes of any major differences 
between the previous year's projections and actual performance.
    (iii) A current balance sheet.
    (iv) A cash flow budget for the period being planned. A monthly cash 
flow budget is required for all lines of credit and operating loans made 
for annual operating purposes. All other loans may include either an 
annual or monthly cash flow budget.
    (v) A copy of the interest assistance needs analysis portion of the 
application form which has been completed based on the planned period's 
cash flow budget.
    (2) The loan will be eligible for continuation of interest 
assistance if the cash flow budget projects a feasible plan with 
interest assistance applied. However, interest assistance can be applied 
only to as many loans as necessary to achieve a positive cash flow for 
the plan period. If the cash flow

[[Page 125]]

budget indicates that the borrower requires a level of interest 
assistance greater than 4 percent to project a feasible plan, then the 
Agency will deny the continuation of interest assistance. Interest 
assistance will be reduced to zero during that period. See Sec. 
762.102(b) for the definition of feasible plan.
    (3) The documentation listed above will be provided to the Agency 
concurrently with the lender's submission of its request for interest 
assistance payment. This information will be provided to the Agency 
within 60 days after the review date specified on the interest 
assistance agreement.
    (4) A request for continuation of interest assistance will be 
completed for 12 month periods, effective on the anniversary date.
    (5) The initial review may be submitted in conjunction with any 
claim within the initial 12 month period. The anniversary date and 
length of the review period will be stated on the interest assistance 
agreement. Any request for interest assistance adjustment submitted 
effective any time other than the review date will be denied, except for 
those cases where it is necessary to service the loan with rescheduling, 
reamortization, deferral or writedown.
    (6) If the review is not completed and submitted to the Agency 
within 1 year of the review date, no claim will be paid for that period.
    (f) Notification of Adverse Action. The lender will be notified in 
writing of all Agency decisions in which a request for interest 
assistance, a request for continuation of interest assistance or 
lender's claim for interest assistance are denied. The notification 
letter will provide specific reasons for the decision and appeals will 
be handled in accordance with parts 11 and 780 of this title.
    (g) Servicing of loans covered by an interest assistance agreement. 
(1) Loans covered by interest assistance agreements cannot be 
consolidated.
    (2) The loan will be transferred with the interest assistance 
agreement only in cases where the transferee was liable for the debt at 
the time interest assistance was granted. Under no other circumstances 
will the interest assistance be transferred. If interest assistance is 
necessary for the transferee to achieve a feasible plan, the lender may 
request such assistance, which may be approved if interest assistance 
funds are available and the applicant is eligible. The maximum length of 
the agreement will be 10 years from the date of the first agreement 
covering a loan for which the transferee was liable. If interest 
assistance is necessary for a feasible plan and funds are not available, 
the request for assumption of the Agency guaranteed debt will be denied.
    (3) When consideration is given to using a debt writedown to service 
a delinquent account, the subsidy level will be recalculated prior to 
any writedown. If a feasible plan can be obtained using interest 
assistance and funds are available, then the interest assistance will be 
authorized and no writedown will be approved. If a feasible plan cannot 
be achieved using 4 percent interest assistance, all further 
calculations for determining debt writedown eligibility and amounts to 
be written down will be based on the borrower receiving no interest 
assistance. If debt writedown is approved, the interest assistance claim 
for the previous review period will be processed in conjunction with the 
writedown loss claim. The interest assistance agreement will not be 
canceled and the anniversary date can remain the same or be re-
established under the same guidelines that it was originally 
established. If the lender determines through its annual analysis that 
interest assistance is necessary for a feasible plan, a request to 
reinstate the subsidy in a subsequent review period may be submitted in 
accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
    (4) In the event of rescheduling or deferral of loans with interest 
assistance, interest assistance will remain available for that loan 
under the terms of the existing interest assistance agreement. 
Additional years of interest assistance and/or increases in the 
restructured loan amount will require additional funding. If the 
additional interest assistance is needed in order to produce a feasible 
plan throughout the life of the rescheduled loan and funds

[[Page 126]]

are not available for the additional interest assistance, then the 
rescheduling will not be approved by the Agency. In no case will the 
subsidy be extended more than 10 years from the effective date of the 
first interest assistance agreement signed by the loan applicant or by 
anyone who signed the note or line of credit agreement.
    (5) In cases where the interest on a loan covered by an interest 
assistance agreement is reduced by court order in a reorganization plan 
under the bankruptcy code, interest assistance agreement will be 
terminated effective on the date of the court ordered interest 
reduction. The lender will file a claim due through the effective date 
of the court ordered interest reduction. Guaranteed loans which have had 
their interest reduced by bankruptcy court order are not eligible to 
receive interest assistance.
    (6) For Loan Guarantees held by holders, Agency purchase of the 
guaranteed portion of a loan will stop interest assistance payments on 
that portion. Interest assistance payments will cease upon termination 
of the Loan Guarantee, upon reaching the expiration date contained in 
the agreement or upon cancellation by the Agency.
    (7) When a borrower defaults on a loan, interest assistance may be 
considered in conjunction with a rescheduling action in accordance with 
Sec. 762.145(b). After the meeting required by Sec. 762.143(b)(3) and 
consideration of actions to correct the delinquency, the lender will 
notify the Agency of the results of the meeting. If the restructuring 
proposal includes interest assistance, the lender will provide the items 
required by paragraph (d) of this section in addition to those items 
required by Sec. 762.145. Liquidation must not be initiated, except in 
accordance with Sec. 762.143(b)(3)(v).
    (h) Cancellation of interest assistance agreement. The interest 
assistance agreement is incontestable except for fraud or 
misrepresentation, of which the lender and borrower have actual 
knowledge at the time that the interest assistance agreement is 
executed, or which the lender or borrower participates in or condones.
    (i) Adjustment of assistance level between review dates. After the 
initial or renewal request for interest assistance is processed, no 
adjustments can be made until the next review or adjustment date except 
when necessary to service the loan with a rescheduling or deferral.
    (j) Excessive interest assistance. Upon written notice to the 
lender, borrower and any holder, the Agency may amend or cancel the 
interest assistance agreement and collect from the lender any amount of 
interest Assistance granted which resulted from incomplete or inaccurate 
information, an error in computation, or any other reason which resulted 
in payment that the lender was not entitled to receive.
    (k) The Deputy Administrator for Farm Loan Programs has the 
authority to grant an exception to any requirement involving interest 
Assistance if it is in the best interest of the Government.

    (6) Upon the lender's assignment of the guaranteed portion of the 
loan, the lender will remain bound to all obligations indicated in the 
Guarantee, Lender's Agreement, the Agency program regulations, and to

loan application. A loan application must be received by the Agency not 
later than 8 months after the date the disaster is declared or 
designated in the county of the applicant's farming operation.
    (2) Qualifying losses--(i) Loss must occur in a disaster area. The 
applicant may seek an Emergency loan only with respect to a family farm 
that had production or physical losses as a result of a disaster in a 
disaster area.
    (ii) Eligible production loss. For production loss loans, the 
applicant must have a disaster yield that is at least 30 percent below 
the normal production yield of any single crop, as determined by the 
Agency, that comprises a basic part of an applicant's total farming 
operation.
    (iii) Eligible physical loss. For physical loss loans, the applicant 
must have suffered disaster-related damage to chattel or real estate 
essential to the farming operation, to household items that must be 
repaired or replaced, to harvested or stored crops, or to perennial 
crops.
    (3) Changes in ownership structure. The ownership structure of a 
family farm may change between the time of a qualifying loss and the 
time an Emergency loan is closed. In such case, all of the following 
requirements must be met:
    (i) The applicant, in its new form, including all owners must meet 
all applicable eligibility requirements contained in this section;
    (ii) The new individual applicant, or all owners of a new entity 
applicant must have had an ownership interest in the farming operation 
at the time of the disaster; and
    (iii) The amount of the loan will be based on the percentage of the 
former farming operation transferred to the new applicant and in no 
event will the individual portions, aggregated, equal more than would 
have been authorized for the former farming operation.
    (4) Insurance requirement. Emergency loan funds may not be used for 
physical loss purposes (excluding losses to livestock) unless that 
physical property was covered by general hazard insurance at the time 
that the damage caused by the natural disaster occurred. The level of 
the coverage in effect at the time of the disaster must have been the 
tax or cost depreciated value, whichever is less. Chattel property must 
have been covered at the tax or cost depreciated value, whichever is 
less, when such insurance was readily available and the benefits of the 
coverage (i.e. the amount of coverage equaling the lesser of the 
property's tax or cost depreciated value) justify the cost of the 
insurance.

comply with applicable Federal, State, local, and industry building 
standards and subpart A of part 1924 of this title.
    (3) Refinancing. Emergency loan funds may not be used to refinance 
consumer debt, such as automobile loans, or credit card debt unless such 
credit card debt is directly attributable to the farming operation.
    (b) Restriction on loan amount. An Emergency loan may not exceed the 
lesser of:
    (1) The amount of credit necessary to restore the family farming 
operation to its pre-disaster condition;
    (2) In the case of a physical loss loan, the total eligible physical 
losses caused by the disaster; or
    (3) In the case of a production loss loan, 100 percent of the total 
actual production loss sustained by the applicant calculated pursuant to 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (c) Maximum cumulative loan principal. The maximum cumulative 
Emergency loan principal that any individual or entity may have 
outstanding is $500,000.
    (d) Production losses. The applicant's actual production loss with 
respect to a crop is calculated as follows:

normal production yield to determine the applicant's per acre production 
loss;
    (2) Multiply the applicant's per acre production loss by the number 
of acres of the farming operation devoted to the crop to determine the 
volume of the production loss;
    (3) Multiply the volume of the applicant's production loss by the 
market price for such crop as determined by the Agency to determine the 
dollar value for the production loss; and
    (4) Subtract any other disaster related compensation or insurance 
indemnities received or to be received by the applicant for the 
production loss.
    (e) Physical loss--(1) Amount of loss. The applicant's total 
eligible physical loss is calculated as follows:
    (i) Add the allowable costs associated with replacing or repairing 
chattel covered by hazard insurance (excluding labor, machinery, 
equipment, or materials contributed by the applicant to repair or 
replace chattel);
    (ii) Add the allowable costs associated with repairing or replacing 
real estate, covered by hazard insurance;
    (iii) Add the value of livestock and livestock products (such 
valuation will be based on a national or regional valuation of species 
or product classification, whichever the Agency determines is more 
accurate);
    (iv) Add the allowable costs to restore perennials, which produce an 
agricultural commodity, to the stage of development the damaged 
perennials had obtained prior to the disaster;
    (v) Add, in the case of an applicant that is an individual, the 
allowable costs associated with repairing or replacing essential 
household contents, not to exceed $20,000; and
    (vi) Subtract any other disaster-related compensation or insurance 
indemnities received or to be received by the applicant for the loss or 
damage to the chattel or real estate.
    (2) Documentation. In the case of physical losses associated with 
livestock, the applicant must have written documentation of the 
inventory of livestock and records of livestock product sales sufficient 
to allow the Agency to value such livestock or livestock products just 
prior to the loss.


<R05>
Sec. 764.6  Interest rate.

    The interest rate applicable for an Emergency loan will be the lower 
of the interest rate at the time of either loan approval or loan closing 
and in no event shall exceed 8 percent annually.


<R05>
Sec. 764.7  Loan terms.

    (a) Basis for repayment. The Agency schedules repayment of Emergency 
loans based on the useful life of the loan security, the applicant's 
repayment ability, and the type of loss.
    (b) Minimum payment requirement. The repayment schedule must include 
at least one payment every year.

[[Page 135]]

    (c) Repayment of loans for annual operating expenses. Emergency 
loans for annual operating expenses, except those expenses associated 
with establishing a perennial crop, must be repaid within 12 months. The 
Agency, however, may extend this term to not more than 18 months to 
accommodate the production cycle of the agricultural commodities of the 
farming operation.
    (d) Repayment of loans for production or physical losses to chattel. 
The repayment schedule for loans for production losses or physical 
losses to chattel (including but not limited to assets with an expected 
life between 1 and 7 years) may not exceed 7 years. If necessary to 
improve the repayment ability of the loan and real estate security is 
available, the term of the loan may be extended up to a total length not 
to exceed 20 years.
    (e) Repayment of loans for physical losses to real estate. The 
repayment schedule for loans for physical losses to real estate is based 
on repayment ability of the applicant and the useful life of the 
security, but in no case will the term of repayment exceed 40 years.


<R05>
Sec. 764.8  Repayment and security requirements.

    (a) General requirements--(1) Ability to repay. The applicant must 
submit a feasible plan that demonstrates the applicant's ability to 
repay the loan. The plan also must demonstrate that the applicant will 
meet all other credit needs and obligations, including judgments, for 
which the applicant is legally responsible.
    (2) Sufficient equity. The applicant must have sufficient equity in 
the security pledged for an Emergency loan to provide adequate security 
for the loan except as permitted in paragraph (f) of this section. The 
applicant must provide additional security, if available, not to exceed 
150 percent of the loan amount.
    (3) Interests in property not owned by the applicant. Interests in 
property not owned by the applicant (such as leases that provide a 
mortgageable value, water rights, easements, mineral rights, and 
royalties) can be offered as security for the loan and will be 
considered in determining whether adequate security is available.
    (b) Real estate loans. In the case of an Emergency loan for real 
estate losses, the loan shall be secured at a minimum by the real estate 
that is being purchased, repaired, replaced, or improved with the loan 
funds.
    (c) Chattel and production loans. In the case of an Emergency loan 
for chattel and production losses, the loan shall be secured, at a 
minimum, by the chattel that is being purchased, repaired, replaced, 
refinanced, or produced with the loan funds.
    (d) Agency lien position--(1) Real estate security. If real estate 
is pledged as security for a loan, the Agency must obtain a first lien, 
if available, on the real estate. When a first lien is not available, 
the Agency may take a junior lien under the following conditions:
    (i) The prior lien does not contain any provision that may 
jeopardize the Agency's interest or the applicant's ability to repay the 
loan to the Agency;
    (ii) Prior lienholders agree to notify the Agency of acceleration 
and foreclosure whenever State law or other arrangements do not require 
such notice; and
    (iii) The applicant must agree to obtain permission from the Agency 
prior to granting any additional security interests in the real estate.
    (2) Real estate held under a purchase contract. If the real estate 
offered as security is held under a recorded purchase contract:
    (i) The applicant must provide a security interest in the real 
estate;
    (ii) The applicant and the purchase contract holder must agree in 
writing that any insurance proceeds received to compensate for real 
estate losses will be used only to replace or repair the damaged real 
estate;
    (iii) The applicant must refinance the existing purchase contract, 
or demonstrate that financing is not available, if an acceptable 
contract of sale cannot be negotiated or the purchase contract holder 
refuses to agree to apply all the insurance proceeds to repair or 
replace the damaged real estate and wants to retain some of the proceeds 
as an extra payment on the balance owed;
    (iv) The purchase contract must not be subject to summary 
cancellation on

[[Page 136]]

default and must not contain any provisions that are contrary to the 
Agency's best interests; and
    (v) The contract holder must agree in writing to notify the Agency 
of any breach by the purchaser, and give the Agency the option to 
rectify the conditions that amount to a breach within 30 days after the 
date the Agency receives written notice of the breach.
    (3) Chattel security. If chattel property is pledged as security for 
a loan the Agency must obtain a first lien on the chattel that is being 
purchased, repaired, replaced, refinanced, or produced with the loan 
funds.
    (e) Same security for multiple loans. The same property may be 
pledged as security for more than one Farm Loan Program loan.
    (f) Lack of adequate security. When adequate security is not 
available because of the disaster, the loan application may be approved 
if the Agency determines, based on the plan required in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section, that there is a reasonable assurance that the applicant 
has the ability to repay the loan (based on an on-going operational 
basis, excluding special one-time sources of income or expenses) 
provided:
    (1) The applicant has pledged as collateral for the loan, all 
available personal and business collateral, except those items listed in 
paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2) of this section;
    (2) The feasible plan, approved by the Agency, indicates the loan 
will be repaid based upon the applicant's production and income history 
and addresses applicable pricing risks through the use of marketing 
contracts, hedging, options, revenue insurance or similar risk 
management practices;
    (3) The applicant has had positive net cash farm income in at least 
3 of the past 5 years; and
    (4) The applicant has given the Agency an assignment on any USDA 
program payments to be received.
    (g) Conditions for taking other assets as security--(1) Conditions. 
In addition to the requirements for adequate and additional security, 
the Agency will take a security interest in other assets (other than 
assets listed under the exceptions in paragraph (h) of this section), if 
available, when:
    (i) An applicant has non-essential assets that are not being 
converted to cash to reduce the loan amount; or
    (ii) The real estate security and chattel security do not provide 
adequate security for the loan.
    (2) List of other assets. Other assets may include:
    (i) A pledge of real estate or chattel by a third party;
    (ii) Patents, copyrights, life insurance, stocks, other securities, 
and membership in cooperatives, owned by the applicant;
    (iii) Assets owned by an applicant that cannot be converted to cash 
without jeopardizing the farm operation; and
    (iv) Non-essential assets owned by the applicant with an aggregate 
value in excess of $5,000.
    (h) Exceptions to security requirements. The Agency will not take a 
security interest in certain property in the following situations:
    (1) The property proposed as security has environmental 
contamination, restrictions, or historical impact that could impair the 
value or expose the Agency to potential liability;
    (2) The Agency cannot obtain a valid lien on the security;
    (3) The applicant's personal residence and appurtenances are on a 
parcel of land separate and apart from that real estate being used as 
adequate security for the loan; or
    (4) The applicant's other assets are used for farming or for 
essential living expenses and are not needed for security purposes, 
including but not limited to, subsistence livestock, cash or special 
cash collateral accounts, retirement accounts, personal vehicles, 
household goods, and small tools and equipment such as hand tools, power 
lawn mowers.
    (i) Requirements for security. (1) For loans over $25,000, title 
clearance is required when real estate is taken as security.
    (2) For loans of $25,000 or less, when real estate is taken as 
security, a certification of ownership in real estate is required. 
Certification of ownership may be in the form of an affidavit which is 
signed by the applicant, naming the record owner of the real estate in 
question and listing the balances

[[Page 137]]

due on all known debts against the real estate. Whenever the loan 
approving official is uncertain of the record owner or debts against the 
real estate security, a title search is required.
    (j) Taking Indian Trust lands as security. The Agency may take a 
lien on Indian Trust lands as security provided that the requirements of 
Sec. 1943.19(a)(7) of this title are satisfied.


<R05>
Sec. 764.9  Appraisal and valuation requirements.

    (a) Establishing value for real estate. Real estate appraisals 
conducted pursuant to this part may be completed by designated 
appraisers or contract appraisers and shall conform to the Uniform 
Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice guidelines and standards in 
accordance with Sec. 761.7 of this chapter.
    (b) Establishing value for agricultural commodities and equipment. 
Valuations of agricultural commodities and equipment shall be 
established as follows:

production (excluding livestock) will be 100 percent of the amount 
loaned for annual operating and essential family household expenses, or 
the amount of expected crop revenue, excluding farm program and 
insurance payments, whichever is lower.
    (2) The value of livestock and equipment will be the market value as 
determined by the Agency in accordance with Sec. 761.7 of this chapter.
    (c) Assets damaged by the disaster. In the case of farm assets 
damaged by the disaster, the value of such security shall be established 
as of the day before the disaster occurred.

<R05>
Sec. 764.10  Insurance for loan security.

    (a) Adequacy of insurance. An applicant must obtain insurance, 
consistent with this section, equal to the lesser of the value of the 
security at the time of loan closing, or the principal of the loan.
    (b) Hazard insurance. All security (except growing crops) must be 
covered by hazard insurance if it is readily available (i.e. sold by 
insurance agents in the applicants normal trade area) and economically 
feasible.
    (c) Flood or mudslide insurance. Real estate security located in 
flood or mudslide prone areas, as determined by the Agency, must be

an applicant's total farming operation, if such insurance is available, 
unless the applicant executes a written waiver of any emergency crop 
loss assistance with respect to such crop.

payments.
    (2) Terms. The term of a loan may not be extended beyond 40 years 
from the date of the original note.

exchange, which adequately secures the unpaid principal balance of the 
loan, will be required unless the Agency determines any remaining land 
or other loan security is adequate security for the loan.

write-down under either the land value option or rental value option, as 
requested by the borrower.

other similarly worded Federal statutes, and the regulations issued 
pursuant thereto that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, 
color, national origin, handicap, religion, age, or sex in programs or 
activities receiving Federal financial assistance. Such provisions apply 
for as long as the property continues to be used for the same or similar 
purposes for which the Federal assistance was extended, or for so long 
as the purchaser owns it, whichever is later.
    (iii) The remaining security for the loan is adequate or will not 
change after the transaction.
    (iv) Sale proceeds remaining after paying any reasonable and 
necessary selling expenses are applied to the Minor Program loan

follows:
    (1) Borrowers with IMP loans that are classified as ``commercial'' 
or ``standard'' must apply for private financing within 30 days from the 
date the borrower is notified of lender interest, if an application is 
required by the lender. For good cause, the Agency may grant the 
borrower a reasonable amount of additional time to apply for 
refinancing.
    (2) Borrowers with AMP loans will be considered for graduation at 
least every two years or more frequently if the Agency determines that 
the borrower's financial condition has significantly improved.


<R05>
Sec. 772.13  Delinquent account servicing.

    (a) AMP loans. If the borrower does not make arrangements to cure 
the default after notice by the Agency and is not eligible for 
reamortization in accordance with Sec. 772.14, the Agency will 
liquidate the account according to Sec. 772.16.
    (b) IMP loans. Delinquent IMP borrowers will be serviced according

Treasury Offset Program and Treasury Cross-Servicing (or successor 
regulations).


<R05>
Sec. 772.14  Reamortization of AMP loans.

    The Agency may approve reamortization of AMP loans provided:
    (a) There is no extension of the final maturity date of the loan;
    (b) No intervening lien exists on the security for the loan which 
would jeopardize the Government's security position;
    (c) If the account is delinquent, it cannot be brought current 
within one year and the borrower has presented a cash flow budget which 
demonstrates the ability to meet the proposed new payment schedule; and
    (d) If the account is current, the borrower will be unable to meet 
the annual loan payments due to circumstances beyond the borrower's 
control.


<R05>
Sec. 772.15  Protective advances.

    (a) The Agency may approve, without regard to any loan or total 
indebtedness limitation, vouchers to pay costs, including insurance and 
real estate taxes, to preserve and protect the security, the lien, or 
the priority of the lien securing the debt owed to the Agency if the 
debt instrument provides that the Agency may voucher the account to 
protect its lien or security.
    (b) The Agency may pay protective advances only when it determines 
it to be in the Government's best financial interest.
    (c) Protective advances are immediately due and payable.

[[Page 150]]


<R05>
Sec. 772.16  Liquidation.

    When the Agency determines that continued servicing will not 
accomplish the objectives of the loan and the delinquency or financial 
distress cannot be cured by the options in Sec. 772.13, or the loan is 
in non-monetary default, the borrower will be encouraged to dispose of 
the Agency security voluntarily through sale or transfer and assumption 
in accordance with this part. If such a transfer or voluntary sale is 
not carried out, the loan will be liquidated according to 7 CFR part 
1955, subpart A. For AMP loans, appeal rights under 7 CFR part 11 are 
provided in the notice of acceleration. For IMP loans, appeal rights 
must be exhausted before acceleration, and the notice of acceleration is 
not appealable.


<R05>
Sec. 772.17  Equal opportunity and non-discrimination requirements.

    With respect to any aspect of a credit transaction, the Agency will 
comply with the requirements of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act as 
implemented in 7 CFR 1910.2, and the Department's civil rights policy in 
7 CFR part 15d.


<R05>
Sec. 772.18  Exception authority.

    Exceptions to any requirement in this subpart can be approved in 
individual cases by the Administrator if application of any requirement 
or failure to take action would adversely affect the Government's 
financial interest. Any exception must be consistent with the 
authorizing statute and other applicable laws.

Sec. 773.1  Introduction.

    This part contains the terms and conditions for loans made under the 
Special Apple Loan Program. These regulations are applicable to 
applicants, borrowers, and other parties involved in making, servicing, 
and liquidating these loans. The program objective is to assist 
producers of apples suffering from economic loss as a result of low 
apple prices.


<R05>
Sec. 773.2  Definitions.

    As used in this part, the following definitions apply:
    Agency is the Farm Service Agency, its employees, and any successor 
agency.
    Apple producer is a farmer in the United States or its territories 
that produced apples, on not less than 10 acres, for sale in 1999 or 
2000.
    Applicant is the individual or business entity applying for the 
loan.
    Business entity is a corporation, partnership, joint operation, 
trust, limited liability company, or cooperative.
    Cash flow budget is a projection listing all anticipated cash 
inflows (including all farm income, nonfarm income and all loan 
advances) and all cash outflows (including all farm and nonfarm debt 
service and other expenses) to be incurred by the borrower during the 
period of the budget. A cash flow budget may be completed either for a 
12 month period, a typical production cycle or the life of the loan, as 
appropriate.
    Domestically owned enterprise is an entity organized in the United 
States under the law of the state or states in which the entity operates 
and a majority of the entity is owned by members meeting the citizenship 
test.
    False information is information provided by an applicant, borrower, 
or other source to the Agency which information is known by the provider 
to be incorrect, and was given to the Agency in order to obtain benefits 
for

[[Page 151]]

which the applicant or borrower would not otherwise have been eligible.
    Feasible plan is a plan that demonstrates that the loan will be 
repaid as agreed, as determined by the Agency.
    Security is real or personal property pledged as collateral to 
assure repayment of a loan in the event there is a default on the loan.
    USPAP is Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice.


<R05>
Sec. 773.3  Appeals.

    A loan applicant or borrower may request an appeal or review of an 
adverse decision made by the Agency in accordance with 7 CFR part 11.


<R05>
Sec. Sec. 773.4-773.5  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 773.6  Eligibility requirements.

    Loan applicants must meet all of the following requirements to be 
eligible for a Special Apple Program Loan:
    (a) The loan applicant must be an apple producer;
    (b) The loan applicant must be a citizen of the United States or an 
alien lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence 
under the Immigration and Nationalization Act. For a business entity 
applicant, the majority of the business entity must be owned by members 
meeting the citizenship test or, other entities that are domestically 
owned. Aliens must provide the appropriate Immigration and 
Naturalization Service forms to document their permanent residency;
    (c) The loan applicant and anyone who will execute the promissory 
note must possess the legal capacity to enter into contracts, including 
debt instruments;
    (d) At loan closing the loan applicant and anyone who will execute 
the promissory note must not be delinquent on any Federal debt, other 
than a debt under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;
    (e) At loan closing the loan applicant and anyone who will execute 
the promissory note must not have any outstanding unpaid judgments 
obtained by the United States in any court. Such judgments do not 
include those filed as a result of action in the United States Tax 
Courts;
    (f) The loan applicant, in past or present dealings with the Agency, 
must not have provided the Agency with false information; and
    (g) The individual or business entity loan applicant and all entity 
members must have acceptable credit history demonstrated by debt 
repayment. A history of failure to repay past debts as they came due 
(including debts to the Internal Revenue Service) when the ability to 
repay was within their control will demonstrate unacceptable credit 
history. Unacceptable credit history will not include isolated instances 
of late payments which do not represent a pattern and were clearly 
beyond the applicant's control or lack of credit history.


<R05>
Sec. 773.7  Loan uses.

    Loan funds may be used for any of the following purposes related to 
the production or marketing of apples:
    (a) Payment of costs associated with reorganizing a farm to improve 
its profitability;
    (b) Payment of annual farm operating expenses;
    (c) Purchase of farm equipment or fixtures;
    (d) Acquiring, enlarging, or leasing a farm;
    (e) Making capital improvements to a farm;
    (f) Refinancing indebtedness;
    (g) Purchase of cooperative stock for credit, production, processing 
or marketing purposes; or
    (h) Payment of loan closing costs.


<R05>
Sec. 773.8  Limitations.

    (a) The maximum loan amount any individual or business entity may 
receive under the Special Apple Loan Program is limited to $500,000.
    (b) The maximum loan is further limited to $300 per acre of apple 
trees in production in 1999 or 2000, whichever is greater.
    (c) Loan funds may not be used to pay expenses incurred for lobbying 
or related activities.
    (d) Loans may not be made for any purpose which contributes to 
excessive erosion of highly erodible land or to the conversion of 
wetlands to produce an agricultural commodity.

[[Page 152]]


<R05>
Sec. 773.9  Environmental compliance.

    (a) Except as otherwise specified in this section, prior to approval 
of any loan, an environmental evaluation will be completed by the Agency 
to determine if the proposed action will have any adverse impacts on the 
human environment and cultural resources. Loan applicants will provide 
all information necessary for the Agency to make its evaluation.
    (b) The following loan actions were reviewed for the purpose of 
compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 40 CFR 
parts 1500 through 1508, and determined not to have a significant impact 
on the quality of the human environment, either individually or 
cumulatively. Therefore the following loan actions are categorically 
excluded from the requirements of an environmental evaluation:
    (1) Payment of legal costs associated with reorganizing a farm to 
improve its profitability as long as there will be no changes in the 
land's use or character;
    (2) Purchase of farm equipment which will not be affixed to a 
permanent mount or position;
    (3) Acquiring or leasing a farm;
    (4) Refinancing an indebtedness not greater than $30,000;
    (5) Purchase of stock in a credit association or in a cooperative 
which deals with the production, processing or marketing of apples; and
    (6) Payment of loan closing costs.
    (c) The loan actions listed in paragraph (b) of this section were 
also reviewed in accordance with section 106 of the National Historic 
Preservation Act (NHPA). It was determined that these loan actions are 
non-undertakings with no potential to affect or alter historic 
properties and therefore, will not require consultation with the State 
Historic Preservation Officer, Tribal Historic Preservation Officer, or 
other interested parties.
    (d) If adverse environmental impacts, either direct or indirect, are 
identified, the Agency will complete an environmental assessment in 
accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality's Regulations for 
Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA to the extent required by 
law.
    (e) In order to minimize the financial risk associated with 
contamination of real property from hazardous waste and other 
environmental concerns, the Agency will complete an environmental risk 
evaluation of the environmental risks to the real estate collateral 
posed by the presence of hazardous substances and other environmental 
concerns.
    (1) The Agency will not accept real estate as collateral which has 
significant environmental risks.
    (2) If the real estate offered as collateral contains significant 
environmental risks, the Agency will provide the applicant with the 
option of properly correcting or removing the risk, or offering other 
non-contaminated property as collateral.

    Borrowers are required to comply with all applicable:

    (2) If the applicant is a business entity, any legal documents 
evidencing the organization and any State recognition of the entity;
    (3) Documentation of compliance with the Agency's environmental 
regulations contained in 7 CFR part 1940, subpart G;
    (4) A balance sheet on the applicant;
    (5) The farm's operating plan, including the projected cash flow 
budget reflecting production, income, expenses, and loan repayment plan;
    (6) The last 3 years of production and income and expense 
information;

[[Page 153]]

    (7) Payment to the Agency for ordering a credit report; and
    (8) Any additional information required by the Agency to determine 
the eligibility of the applicant, the feasibility of the operation, or 
the adequacy and availability of security.
    (b) Except as required in Sec. 773.19(e), the Agency will waive 
requirements for a complete application, listed in paragraphs (a)(5) and 
(a)(6) of this section, for requests of $30,000 or less.


<R05>
Sec. 773.19  Interest rate, terms, security requirements, and repayment.

    (a) Interest rate. The interest rate will be fixed for the term of 
the loan. The rate will be established by the Agency and available in 
each Agency Office, based upon the cost of Government borrowing for 
loans of similar maturities.
    (b) Terms. The loan term will be for up to 3 years, based upon the 
useful life of the security offered.
    (c) Security requirements. The Agency will take a lien on the 
following security, if available, as necessary to adequately secure the 
loan:
    (1) Real estate;
    (2) Chattels;
    (3) Crops;
    (4) Other assets owned by the applicant; and
    (5) Assets owned and pledged by a third party.
    (d) Documentation of security value. (1) For loans that are for 
$30,000 or less, collateral value will be based on the best available, 
verifiable information.
    (2) For loans of greater than $30,000 where the applicant's balance 
sheet shows a net worth of three times the loan amount or greater, 
collateral value will be based on tax assessment of real estate and 
depreciation schedules of chattels, as applicable, less any existing 
liens.
    (3) For loans of greater than $30,000 where the applicant's balance 
sheet shows a net worth of less than three times the loan amount, 
collateral value will be based on an appraisal. Such appraisals must be 
obtained by the applicant, at the applicant's expense and acceptable to 
the Agency. Appraisals of real estate must be completed in accordance 
with USPAP.
    (e) Repayment. (1) All loan applicants must demonstrate that the 
loan can be repaid.
    (2) For loans that are for $30,000 or less where the applicant's 
balance sheet shows a net worth of three times the loan amount or 
greater, repayment ability will be considered adequate without further 
documentation.
    (3) For loans that are for $30,000 or less where the applicant's 
balance sheet shows a net worth of less than three times the loan 
amount, repayment ability must be demonstrated using the farm's 
operating plan, including a projected cash flow budget based on 
historical performance. Such operating plan is required notwithstanding 
Sec. 773.18 of this part.
    (4) For loans that are for more than $30,000, repayment ability must 
be demonstrated using the farm's operating plan, including a projected 
cash flow budget based on historical performance.
    (f) Creditworthiness. All loan applicants must have an acceptable 
credit history demonstrated by debt repayment. A history of failure to 
repay past debts as they came due (including debts to the Internal 
Revenue Service) when the ability to repay was within their control will 
demonstrate unacceptable credit history. Unacceptable credit history 
will not include isolated instances of late payments which do not 
represent a pattern and were clearly beyond the applicant's control or 
lack of credit history.


<R05>
Sec. 773.20  Funding applications.

    Loan requests will be funded based on the date the Agency approves 
the application. Loan approval is subject to the availability of funds.


<R05>
Sec. 773.21  Loan decision, closing, and fees.

determines that:
    (i) The loan can be repaid;

    (iii) The applicant has been determined eligible;
    (iv) All security requirements have been, or will be met at closing;

specified by the loan approval official in the notification of loan 
approval prior to loan closing;
    (2) There must have been no significant changes in the plan of 
operation or the applicant's financial condition since the loan was 
approved; and
    (2) The applicant will execute all loan instruments and legal 
documents required by the Agency to evidence the debt, perfect the 
required security interest in property securing the loan, and protect 
the Government's interests, in accordance with applicable State and 
Federal laws. In the case of an entity applicant, all officers or 
partners and any board members also will be required to execute the 
promissory notes as individuals.
    (c) Fees. The applicant will pay all loan closing fees including 
credit report fees, fees for appraisals, fees for recording any legal 
instruments determined to be necessary, and all notary, lien search, and 
similar fees incident to loan transactions. No fees will be assessed for 
work performed by Agency employees.


<R05>
Sec. 773.22  Loan servicing.

    Loans will be serviced in accordance with subpart J of part 1951, or 
its successor regulation, during the term of the loan. If the loan is 
not paid in full during this term, servicing will proceed in accordance 
with Sec. 1951.468 of that part.


<R05>

this section, if the proposed change is in the best financial interest 
of the Government and not inconsistent with the authorizing statute or 
other applicable law.

Sec. 780.1  General.

    This part sets forth rules applicable to appealability reviews, 
reconsiderations, appeals and alternative dispute resolution procedures 
comprising in aggregate the informal appeals process of FSA. FSA will 
apply these rules to facilitate and expedite participants' submissions 
and FSA reviews of documentary and other evidence material to resolution 
of disputes arising under agency program regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 780.2  Definitions.

    For purposes of this part:
    1994 Act means the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of 
Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-354).
    Adverse decision means a program decision by an employee, officer, 
or committee of FSA that is adverse to the participant. The term 
includes any denial of program participation, benefits, written 
agreements, eligibility, etc., that results in a participant receiving 
less funds than the participant believes should have been paid or not 
receiving a program benefit to which the participant believes the 
participant was entitled.
    Agency means FSA and its county and State committees and their 
personnel, CCC, NRCS, and any other agency or office of the Department 
which the Secretary may designate, or any successor agency.
    Agency record means all documents and materials maintained by FSA 
that are related to the adverse decision under review that are compiled 
and reviewed by the decision-maker or that are compiled in the record 
provided to the next level reviewing authority.
    Appeal means a written request by a participant asking the next 
level reviewing authority within FSA to review a decision. However, 
depending on the context, the term may also refer to a request for 
review by NAD.
    Appealability review means review of a decision-maker's 
determination that a decision is not appealable under this part. That 
decision is, however, subject to review according to Sec. 780.5 or 7 
CFR part 11 to determine whether the decision involves a factual dispute 
that is appealable or is, instead, an attempt to challenge generally 
applicable program policies, provisions, regulations, or statutes that 
were not appealable.
    Appellant means any participant who appeals or requests 
reconsideration or mediation of an adverse decision in accordance with 
this part or 7 CFR part 11.

Act waiver and is authorized in writing by a participant to act for the 
participant in a reconsideration, mediation, or appeal.
    CCC means the Commodity Credit Corporation, a wholly owned 
Government corporation within USDA.

mediation program, approved by the Secretary, that meets the 
requirements of 7 CFR part 785.
    Confidential mediation means a mediation process in which neither

Title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3801 et seq.), as 
amended.

    Final decision means a program decision rendered by an employee or 
officer of FSA pursuant to delegated authority, or by the county or 
State committee upon written request of a participant. A decision that 
is otherwise final shall remain final unless the decision is timely 
appealed to the State committee or NAD. A decision of FSA made by 
personnel subordinate to the county committee is considered ``final'' 
for the purpose of appeal to NAD only after that decision has been 
appealed to the county committee under the provisions of this part.
    Hearing means an informal proceeding on an appeal to afford a 
participant opportunity to present testimony, documentary evidence, or 
both to show why an adverse decision is in error and why the adverse 
decision should be reversed or modified.
    Implement means the taking of action by FSA, NRCS, or CCC that is 
necessary to effectuate fully and promptly a final decision.
    Mediation means a technique for resolution of disputes in which a 
mediator assists disputing parties in voluntarily reaching mutually 
agreeable settlement of issues within the laws, regulations, and the 
agency's generally applicable program policies and procedures, but in 
which the mediator has no authoritative decision making power.
    Mediator means a neutral individual who functions specifically to 
aid the parties in a dispute during a mediation process.
    NAD means the USDA National Appeals Division established pursuant to 
the 1994 Act.

    Participant means any individual or entity who has applied for, or 
whose right to participate in or receive, a payment, loan, loan 
guarantee, or other benefit in accordance with any program of FSA to 
which the regulations in this part apply is affected by a decision of 
FSA. The term includes anyone meeting this definition regardless of 
whether, in the particular proceeding, the participant is an appellant 
or a third party respondent. The term does not include individuals or 
entities whose claim(s) arise under the programs excluded in the 
definition of ``participant'' published at 7 CFR 11.1.
    Qualified mediator means a mediator who meets the training 
requirements established by State law in the State in which mediation 
services will be provided or, where a State has no law prescribing 
mediator qualifications, an individual who has attended a minimum of 40 
hours of core mediator knowledge and skills training and, to remain in a 
qualified mediator status, completes a minimum of 20 hours of additional 
training or education during each 2-year period. Such training or 
education must be approved by USDA, by an accredited college or 
university, or by one of the following organizations: State Bar of a 
qualifying State, a State mediation association, a State approved

Sec. 781.1  General.

    The purpose of these regulations is to set forth the requirements 
designed to implement the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act

disposes of, or holds an interest in United States agricultural land 
shall disclose such transactions and holdings to the Secretary of 
Agriculture. In particular, the regulations establish a system for the 
collection of information by the Agricultural Stablization and 
Conservation Service (FSA) pertaining to foreign investment in United 
States agricultural land. The information collected will be utilized in 
the preparation of periodic reports to Congress and the President by the 
Economic Research Service (ERS) concerning the effect of such holdings 
upon family farms and rural communities.

    (2) Submission of an incomplete report or a report containing 
misleading or false information, failure to submit a report or failure 
to maintain a submitted report with accurate information: 25 percent of 
the fair market value, as determined by the Farm Service Agency, of the

    (ii) Method of discovery of the violation.
    (iii) Extenuating circumstances concerning the violation.

last used as agricultural land. The price or current estimated value 
reported by the foreign person, as verified and/or adjusted by the 
County Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Committee for the 
County where the land is located, will be considered to be the fair 
market value.


<R05>
Sec. 781.5  Penalty review procedure.

    (a) Whenever it appears that a foreign person has violated the 
reporting obligation as described in paragraph (a) of Sec. 781.4, a 
written notice of apparent liability will be sent to the foreign 
person's last known address by the Farm Service Agency. This notice will 
set forth the facts which indicate apparent liability, identify the type 
of violation listed in paragraph (a) of Sec. 781.4 which is involved, 
state the amount of the penalty to be imposed, include a statement of 
fair market value of the foreign person's interest in the subject land, 
and summarize the courses of action available to the foreign person.
    (b) The foreign person involved shall respond to a notice of 
apparent liability within 60 days after the notice is mailed. If a 
foreign person fails to respond to the notice of apparent liability, the 
proposed penalty shall become final. Any of the following actions by the 
foreign person shall constitute a response meeting the requirements of 
this paragraph.
    (1) Payment of the proposed penalty in the amount specified in the 
notice of apparent liability and filing of a report, if required, in 
compliance with Sec. 781.3. The amount shall be paid by check or money 
order drawn to the Treasurer of the United States and shall be mailed to 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013. 
The Department is not responsible for the loss of currency sent through 
the mails.
    (2) Submission of a written statement denying liability for the 
penalty in whole or in part. Allegations made in any such statement must 
be supported by detailed factual data. The

[[Page 170]]

statement should be mailed to the Administrator, Farm Service Agency, 
U.S. Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013.
    (3) A request for a hearing on the proposed penalty may be filed in 
accordance with part 780 of this title.
    (c) After a final decision is issued pursuant to an appeal under 
part 780 of this title, the Administrator or Administrator's designee 
shall mail the foreign person a notice of the determination on appeal, 
stating whether a report must be filed or amended in compliance with 
Sec. 781.3, the amount of the penalty (if any), and the date by which 
it must be paid. The foreign person shall file or amend the report as 
required by the Administrator. The penalty in the amount stated shall be 
paid by check or money order drawn to the Treasurer of the United States 
and shall be mailed to the United States Department of Agriculture, P.O. 
Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013. The Department is not responsible for 
the loss of currency sent through the mails.
    (d) If the foreign person contests the notice of apparent liability 
by submitting a written statement or a request for a hearing thereon, 
the foreign person may elect either to pay the penalty or decline to pay 
the penalty pending resolution of the matter by the Administrator. If 
the Administrator determines that the foreign person is not liable for 
the penalty or is liable for less than the amount paid, the payment will 
be wholly or proportionally refunded. If the Administrator ultimately 
determines that the foreign person is liable, the penalty finally 
imposed shall not exceed the amount imposed in the notice of apparent 
liability.
    (e) If a foreign person fails to respond to the notice of apparent 
liability as required by paragraph (b) of this section, or fails to pay 
the penalty imposed by the Administrator under paragraph (d) of this 
section, the case will, without further notice, be referred by the 
Department to the Department of Justice for prosecution in the 
appropriate District Court to recover the amount of the penalty.
    (f) Any amounts approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for 
disbursement to a foreign person under the programs administered by the 
Department may be setoff against penalties assessed hereunder against 
such person, in accordance with the provisions of 7 CFR part 13.

that, as of April 8, 1994, required end-use certificates for imports of 
U.S.-produced wheat or barley.

[[Page 172]]

    (b) The provisions of the regulations in this part may be suspended 
if the Secretary, after consulting with domestic producers, determines 
that the program has directly resulted in the:
    (1) Reduction of income to U.S. producers of agricultural 
commodities, or
    (2) Reduction of the competitiveness of U.S. agricultural 
commodities in world export markets.

    (a) The program will be administered under the general supervision 
and direction of the Administrator, Farm Service Agency (FSA), and the 
Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs, FSA. In the field, the 
regulations in this part will be administered by the FSA State and 
county committees.

    (1) Correct, or require a county committee to correct any action 
taken by such county committee that is not in accordance with the 
regulations of this part; or
    (2) Require a county committee to withhold taking any action that is 
not in accordance with this part.
    (d) No provision or delegation to a State or county committee shall 
preclude the Deputy Administrator, FSA, or a designee, from determining 
any question arising under the program or from reversing or modifying 
any determination made by a State or county committee.
    (e) The Deputy Administrator may authorize State and county 
committees to waive or modify deadlines, except statutory deadlines, and 
other non-statutory requirements in cases where lateness or failure to 
meet such other requirements does not adversely affect operation of the 
program.

production of grapes, kiwi fruit, or passion fruit or similar fruit as 
approved by the Deputy Administrator.
    County office means the FSA or USDA Service Center that is 
responsible for servicing the farm on which the trees, bushes or vines 
are located.
    Deputy Administrator means the Deputy Administrator for Farm 
Programs, FSA, or a designee.
    Eligible bush means, a low, branching, woody plant from which an 
annual fruit or vegetable crop is produced for commercial purposes, such 
as a blueberry bush.

[[Page 177]]

    Eligible orchardist means an individual, or legal entity, including 
an Indian tribe as defined under the Indian Self-Determination and 
Education Assistance Act; an Indian organization or entity chartered 
under the Indian Reorganization Act; a tribal organization as defined 
under the Indian Self-Determination Education and Assistance Act; or, an 
economic enterprise as defined under the Indian Financing Act of 1974, 
which owns a tree, bush or vine as defined in this part.
    Eligible tree means, a tall, woody plant having comparatively great 
height, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, and a single trunk 
from which an annual crop is produced for commercial purposes, such as 
maple tree for syrup, papaya tree, or orchard tree. Plantain and banana 
plants are also included. Trees used for pulp or timber are not 
considered eligible trees under this part.
    Eligible vine means a plant with a flexible stem supported by 
climbing, twining, or creeping along a surface and from which an annual

that the trees, bushes or vines are susceptible to losses at 
significantly differing levels.
    Lost means with respect to the extent of damage to a tree or other 
plant that the damage is such that it would, as determined by FSA, be 
more economically beneficial to replace the plant rather than to leave 
it in its deteriorated, low producing state.

fire, freeze, flood, earthquake, lightning, or other natural occurrence 
of such magnitude or severity so as to be considered disastrous, as

knowledge about the applicant's normal operations.


<R05>
Sec. 783.6  Benefits.

    (a) Subject to the availability of TAP funds, an approved eligible 
orchardist shall be reimbursed in an amount not to exceed 75 percent of 
the eligible costs for the qualifying loss (that loss over and above the 
calculated 15% mortality). The payment shall be the lesser of the 75% of 
actual costs for the replanting or the amount calculated using rates 
established by the State committee (not to exceed the maximum amount the 
Deputy Administrator establishes). The costs permitted shall only be 
approved for:
    (1) Seedlings or cuttings, for tree, bush or vine replanting;
    (2) Site preparation and debris handling within normal cultural 
practices for the type of individual stand being re-established and 
necessary to ensure successful plant survival;
    (3) Chemicals and nutrients necessary for successful establishment;
    (4) Labor to plant seedlings or cuttings as determined reasonable by 
the county committee; and
    (5) Labor used to transplant existing seedlings established through 
natural regeneration into a productive tree stand.
    (b) Costs for fencing, irrigation, irrigation equipment, protection 
of seedlings from wildlife, general improvements, re-establishing 
structures, windscreens and other costs as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator are not eligible for reimbursement benefits.
    (c) When lost stands are replanted, the types planted may be 
different than those originally planted if the new types have the same 
general end use, as the county committee determines and approves. 
Payments will be based on the lesser of rates established to plant the 
types actually lost or the cost to establish the alternative used. If 
the species of plantings, seedlings or cuttings differs significantly 
from the species lost then, except as the county committee determines, 
the costs may not be reimbursed.
    (d) Eligible orchardists may elect not to replant the entire 
eligible stand. If so, the county committee shall calculate payment 
based on the number of qualifying trees, bushes or vines actually 
replanted.
    (e) The cumulative total quantity of acres planted to trees, bushes 
or vines

[[Page 179]]

for which a person may receive assistance at any time under this part 
shall not exceed 500 acres.
    (f) The cumulative amount of TAP benefits which any person, as 
defined in accordance with part 1400 of this title, may receive under 
this part shall not exceed $75,000.
    (g) In the event the total amount of claims submitted under this 
part during a sign-up period exceeds the applicable funds available for 
such period, such payments shall be reduced by a uniform national 
percentage or by such other method deemed appropriate by the Deputy 
Administrator. Such payment reductions shall be applied after the 
imposition of applicable payment limitation provisions.


<R05>
Sec. 783.7  Obligations of a participant.

    (a) Eligible orchardists must execute all required documents and 
complete the TAP funded practice within 12 months of application 
approval.
    (b) If a person was erroneously determined to be eligible or becomes 
ineligible for all or part of a TAP benefit, the person and successor 
shall refund any payment paid under this part together with interest 
from the date of disbursement at a rate in accordance with part 1403 of 
this title.
    (c) Participants must allow representatives of FSA to visit the site 
for the purposes of certifying compliance with TAP requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 783.8  Multiple benefits.

    Persons may not receive or retain payments for production losses 
from trees, vines and bushes under this part if they have been 
compensated under another program for the same loss. However, this 
restriction does not apply to emergency Federal loans or payments 
resulting from purchase of the additional coverage insurance, as defined 
in 7 CFR 400.651. However, in no case shall the total amount received 
from all sources exceed the amount of the owner's actual loss, unless 
the Deputy Administrator shall approve an exemption in writing.


<R05>
Sec. 783.9  Miscellaneous.

    (a) Any payment or portion thereof due any person under this part 
shall be allowed without regard to questions of title under State law, 
and without regard to any claim or lien in favor of any person except 
agencies of the U.S. Government.
    (b) Persons shall be ineligible to receive or retain assistance

payment and their successors shall be jointly and severally liable for 
any amount due. The remedies provided to FSA in this part shall be in 
addition to other civil, criminal, or administrative remedies which may 
apply.
    (d) Program documents executed by persons legally authorized to 
represent estates or trusts will be accepted only if such person 
furnishes evidence of the authority to execute such documents.
    (e) A minor who is an owner that has met all other eligibility 
criteria shall be eligible for TAP assistance if:
    (1) The minor establishes that the right of majority has been 
conferred on the minor by court proceedings or by statute; or
    (2) A guardian has been appointed to manage the minor's property and 
the applicable program documents are executed by the guardian; or
    (3) A bond is furnished under which the surety guarantees any loss 
incurred for which the minor would be liable had the minor been an 
adult.
    (f) The regulations regarding reconsideration's and appeals at part

determined by FSA only, to have been acquired or held during the base 
period by eligible sheep and lamb operations for breeding purposes. 
Payments may be made for eligible ewe lambs held continuously by the 
operation, through the end of the compliance period, from the time of 
the first possession of the ewe lamb in the base period. The payment 
rate cannot exceed the rate provided for in Sec. 784.6 and may be 
prorated pursuant to Sec. 784.7. For purposes of this section, the 
``base period'' is the period from August 1, 2003, through July 31, 
2004. A purchase in the base period without possession in the base 
period will not be considered an acquisition in the base period for 
purposes of this section unless otherwise allowed by FSA.
    (b) For the ewe lamb to be eligible, a sheep and lamb operation must 
certify that the ewe lamb:
    (1) During at least part of the base period was a ewe lamb which was 
both, at the same time, not older than 18 months of age and had not 
produced an offspring; and
    (2) At the time of certification, does not possess any of the 
following characteristics:
    (i) Parrot mouth; or
    (ii) Foot rot.
    (c) The sheep and lamb operation must certify and agree to:
    (1) Maintain the qualifying ewe lambs in the herd for at least one 
complete, normal offspring lambing cycle, the end of which shall 
constitute the end of the compliance period for the purposes of 
paragraph (a) of this section, and actually maintain the lambs for that 
period in accord with that certification. The ``offspring'' lambing

[[Page 182]]

cycle refers to the time in which the qualifying ewe lamb's own 
offspring would be weaned, in a normal course, from that qualifying ewe 
if the ewe were to have offspring, irrespective of whether the ewe 
actually produces offspring.
    (2) Upon request by an AMS agent or FSA representative, allow the 
AMS agent or FSA Representative to verify that the ewe lambs meet 
qualifying characteristics. Spot checks will be conducted by FSA within 
30 days of the end of the sign-up period. Any animal showing evidence of 
parrot mouth, foot rot, or scrapie in such spot checks will be 
considered to have had those conditions at the time of certification. 
Other spot checks may be conducted as needed.
    (3) Maintain documentation of any death loss of qualifying ewe 
lambs.
    (4) Agree to refund any payments made with respect to any ewe lamb 
or offspring that has died before completing the full program 
requirements where said deaths for the operation exceed 10 percent.
    (5) Be in compliance with all requirements relating to scrapie, as 
described in 9 CFR parts 54 and 79.
    (d) To be eligible for any payments addressed under this section, a 
sheep and lamb operation must be engaged in the business of producing

    (e) In addition, to be eligible for payment, a sheep and lamb 
operation must submit a timely application during the application period 
for benefits and comply with all other terms and conditions of this part 
or that are contained in the application for such benefits, and such 
other conditions as may be imposed by FSA.
    (f) Proof that each lamb was held during and through the end of the 
base period as required by paragraph (a) of this section, as must be 
determined individually for each lamb, shall be provided in such manner, 
and with such access to the operation and the documents and information 
related to the operation, as FSA may request.

Sec. 784.6  Rate of payment and limitations on funding.

    (a) Subject to the availability of funds and to the proration 
provisions of Sec. 784.7, payments for qualifying operations shall be 
$18 for each qualifying ewe lamb retained or purchased for breeding 
purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 784.7  Availability of funds.

    Total payments under this part, unless otherwise determined by the 
FSA, cannot exceed $18 million. In the event that approval of all 
eligible applications would result in expenditures in excess of the 
amount available, FSA shall prorate the available funds by a national 
factor to reduce the expected payments to be made to the amount 
available. The payment shall be made based on the national factored rate 
as determined by FSA. FSA shall prorate the payments in such manner as 
it, in its sole discretion, finds appropriate and reasonable.

this program;
    (2) Made any fraudulent representation; or
    (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination.
    (b) Any funds disbursed pursuant to this part to any person or 
operation engaged in a misrepresentation, scheme, or device, shall be 
refunded with interest together with such other sums as may become due. 
Any sheep and lamb operation or person engaged in acts prohibited by 
this section and any sheep and lamb operation or person receiving 
payment under this part shall be jointly and severally liable with other 
persons or operations involved in such claim for benefits for any refund

maintain accurate records and accounts that will document that they meet 
all eligibility requirements specified herein. Such records and accounts

lamb operations under this program. Destruction of the records after 
such date shall be at the risk of the party undertaking the destruction.


<R05>
Sec. 784.13  Refunds; joint and several liability.

    (a) In the event there is an inaccurate certification or a failure 
to comply with any term, requirement, or condition for payment arising 
under the application, or this part, and if any refund of a payment to 
FSA shall otherwise become due in connection with the application, or 
this part, all related payments made under this part to any sheep and 
lamb operation shall be refunded to FSA together with interest as 
determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section and late 
payment charges as provided in part 1403 of this title.
    (b) All persons signing a sheep and lamb operation's application for 
payment as having an interest in the operation shall be jointly and 
severally liable for any refund, including related charges, that is 
determined to be due for any reason under the terms and conditions of 
the application or this part with respect to such operation.
    (c) Interest shall be charged on refunds required of any person 
under this part if FSA determines that payments or other assistance was 
provided to a person who was not eligible for such assistance. Such 
interest shall be charged at the rate of interest that the United States 
Treasury charges the Commodity Credit Corporation for funds, from the 
date FSA made such benefits available to the date of repayment or the

that the cause of the erroneous determination was not due to any action 
of the person.
    (d) Interest determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this 
section may be waived at the discretion of FSA alone for refunds 
resulting from those violations determined by FSA to have been beyond 
the control of the person committing the violation.
    (e) Late payment interest shall be assessed on all refunds in 
accordance with the provisions of, and subject to the rates prescribed 
in 7 CFR part 792.
    (f) Any excess payments made by FSA with respect to any application 
under this part must be refunded.
    (g) In the event that a benefit under this subpart was provided as 
the result of erroneous information provided by any person, the benefit

<R05>
Sec. 785.4  Grants to certified State mediation programs.

    (a) Eligibility. To be eligible to receive a grant, a State 
mediation program must:
    (1) Be certified as described in Sec. 785.3; and
    (2) Submit an application for a grant with its certification or re-
certification request as set forth in this section.
    (b) Application for grant. A State requesting a grant will submit 
the following to the Administrator:
    (1) Application for Federal Assistance, Standard Form 424 (available 
in any FSA office and on the Internet, http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/
grants/);
    (2) A budget with supporting details providing estimates of the cost 
of operation and administration of the program. Proposed direct 
expenditures will be grouped in the categories of allowable direct costs 
under the program as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section;

pay the allowable costs of operation and administration of the 
components of a qualifying State's mediation program that have been 
certified as set forth in Sec. 785.3(b)(2). Costs of services other 
than mediation services to covered persons within the State are not 
considered part of the cost of operation and administration of the 
mediation program for the purpose of determining the amount of a grant 
award.
    (1) Allowable costs. Subject to applicable cost principles as set 
forth or referenced in Sec. 3016.22 of this title, allowable costs for 
operations and administration are limited to those that are reasonable 
and necessary to carry out the State's certified mediation program in 
providing mediation services for covered persons within the State. 
Specific categories of costs allowable under the certified State 
mediation program include, and are limited to:
    (i) Staff salaries and fringe benefits;
    (ii) Reasonable fees and costs of mediators;
    (iii) Office rent and expenses, such as utilities and equipment 
rental;

Principles found in part 3015, subpart T, of this title and OMB Circular 
No. A-87; and
    (iv) Services provided by a State mediation program that are not 
consistent with the features of the mediation program certified by the 
State, including advocacy services on behalf of a mediation participant, 
such as representation of a mediation client before an administrative

Federal or State Court proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 785.5  Fees for mediation services.

    A requirement that non-USDA parties who elect to participate in 
mediation pay a fee for mediation services will not preclude 
certification of a certified State mediation program or its eligibility 
for a grant; however, if participation in mediation is mandatory for a 
USDA agency, a certified State mediation program may not require the 
USDA agency to pay a fee to participate in a mediation.


<R05>
Sec. 785.6  Deadlines and address.

    (a) Deadlines. (1) To be a qualifying State as of the beginning of a 
fiscal year and to be eligible for grant funding as of the beginning of 
the fiscal year, the Governor of a State or head of a State agency 
designated by the Governor of a State must submit a request for 
certification and application for grant on or before August 1 of the 
calendar year in which the fiscal year begins.
    (2) Requests received after August 1. FSA will accept requests for 
re-certifications and for new certifications of State mediation programs 
after August 1 in each calendar year; however, such requests will not be 
considered for grant funding under Sec. 785.7(c) until after March 1.
    (3) Requests for additional grant funds during a fiscal year. Any 
request by a State mediation program that is eligible for grant funding 
as of the beginning of the fiscal year for additional grant funds during 
that fiscal year for additional, unbudgeted demands for mediation

    (b) Address. The request for certification or re-certification and 
any grant request must be mailed or delivered to: Administrator, Farm 
Service Agency, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Stop 0501, 1400

<R05>
Sec. 785.7  Distribution of Federal grant funds.

    (a) Maximum grant award. A grant award shall not exceed 70 percent 
of the budgeted allowable costs of operation and administration of the 
certified State mediation program. In no case will the sum granted to a 
State exceed $500,000 per fiscal year.
    (b) Funding criteria. FSA will consider the following in determining 
the grant award to a qualifying State:
    (1) Demand for and use of mediation services (historical and 
projected);
    (2) Scope of mediation services;
    (3) Service record of the State program, as evidenced by:
    (i) Number of inquiries;
    (ii) Number of requests for and use of mediation services, 
historical and projected, as applicable;

[[Page 188]]

    (iii) Number of mediations resulting in signed mediation agreements;
    (iv) Timeliness of mediation services; and
    (v) Activities promoting awareness and use of mediation;
    (4) Historic use of program funds (budgeted versus actual); and
    (5) Material changes in the State program.
    (c) Disbursements of grant funds. (1) Grant funds will be paid in 
advance, in installments throughout the Federal fiscal year as requested 
by a certified State mediation program and approved by FSA. The initial 
payment to a program in a qualifying State eligible for grant funding as 
of the beginning of a fiscal year shall represent at least one-fourth of 
the State's annual grant award. The initial payment will be made as soon 
as practicable after certification, or re-certification, after grant 
funds are appropriated and available.
    (2) Payment of grant funds will be by electronic funds transfer to 
the designated account of each certified State mediation program, as 
approved by FSA.
    (d) Administrative reserve fund. After funds are appropriated, FSA 
will set aside 5 percent of the annual appropriation for use as an 
administrative reserve.
    (1) Subject to paragraph (a) of this section and the availability of 
funds, the Administrator will allocate and disburse sums from the 
administrative reserve in the following priority order:
    (i) Disbursements to cover additional, unbudgeted demands for 
mediation services in qualifying States eligible for grant funding as of 
the beginning of the fiscal year;
    (ii) Grants to qualifying States whose requests for new 
certification or re-certification were received between August 2 and 
March 1. A previously qualifying State that submits a request for re-
certification received after August 1 may receive a grant award 
effective as of the beginning of the fiscal year. A newly qualifying 
State that submits a request for certification received after August 1 
may receive a grant award effective March 31 of the fiscal year.
    (iii) Any balance remaining in the administrative reserve will be 
allocated pro rata to certified State mediation programs based on their 
initial fiscal year grant awards.
    (2) All funds from the administrative reserve will be made available 
on or before March 31 of the fiscal year.
    (e) Period of availability of funds. (1) Certified State mediation 
programs receiving grant funds are encouraged to obligate award funds 
within the Federal fiscal year of the award. A State may, however, carry 
forward any funds disbursed to its certified State mediation program 
that remain unobligated at the end of the fiscal year of award for use 
in the next fiscal year for costs resulting from obligations in the 
subsequent funding period. Any carryover balances plus any additional 
obligated fiscal year grant will not exceed the lesser of 70 percent of 
the State's budgeted allowable costs of operation and administration of 
the certified State mediation program for the subsequent fiscal year, or 
$500,000.
    (2) Grant funds not spent in accordance with this part will be 
subject to de-obligation and must be returned to the USDA.


<R05>
Sec. 785.8  Reports by qualifying States receiving mediation grant funds.

    (a) Annual report by certified State mediation program. No later 
than 30 days following the end of a fiscal year during which a 
qualifying State received a grant award under this part, the State must 
submit to the Administrator an annual report on its certified State 
mediation program. The annual report must include the following:

and obtaining program funding from sources other than the grant under 
this part.

prior fiscal years, as appropriate, for comparisons of program 
activities and outcomes of the cases opened and closed during the 
reporting period; mediation services provided to clients grouped by 
program and subdivided by issue, USDA agency, types of covered persons 
and other participants; and the resolution rate for each category of 
issue reported for cases closed during the year;
    (2) An assessment of the performance and effectiveness of the 
State's certified mediation program considering:

receiving a grant under this part must submit an audit report to the 
Administrator in compliance with OMB Circular A-133.

beginning of the mediation session that the USDA, including the USDA 
Inspector General, the Comptroller General of the United States, the 
Administrator, and any of their representatives will have access to 
pertinent records as necessary to monitor and to conduct audits, 
investigations, or evaluations of mediation services funded in whole or 
in part by the USDA.
    (c) All participants in a mediation must sign and date an 
acknowledgment of receipt of such notice from the mediator. The

State mediation program, terminate or suspend the grant to such program, 
require a return of unspent grant funds, a

otherwise misleading.
    (b) In the event that FSA gives notice to the State of its intent to 
enforce any withdrawal of certification or other penalty for non-
compliance, USDA agencies will cease to participate in any mediation 
conducted by the State's mediation program immediately upon delivery of 
such notice to the State.


<R05>
Sec. 785.11  Reconsideration by the Administrator.

    (a) A State mediation program may request that the Administrator 
reconsider any determination that a State is not a qualifying State 
under Sec. 785.3 and any penalty decision made under Sec. 785.10. The 
decision of the Administrator upon reconsideration shall be the final 
administrative decision of FSA.
    (b) Nothing in this part shall preclude action to suspend or debar a 
State mediation program or administering entity under part 3017 of this

balance of the debt as prescribed in Sec. 792.10(e);
    (b) When FSA deems it necessary to protect the Government's 
interest, written demand may be preceded by other appropriate actions.


<R05>
Sec. 792.5  Collection by payment in full.

    Except as FSA may provide, FSA shall collect debts owed to the 
Government, including applicable interest, penalties, and administrative 
costs, in full, whenever feasible whether the debt is being collected by 
administrative offset or by another method, including voluntary payment. 
If a debt is paid in one lump sum after the due date, FSA will impose 
late payment interest, as provided in Sec. 792.10, unless such interest 
is waived as provided in Sec. 792.11.


<R05>
Sec. 792.6  Collection by installment payments.

    (a) Payments in installments may be arranged, at FSA' discretion, if 
a debtor furnishes satisfactory evidence of inability to pay a claim in 
full by the specified date. The size and frequency of installment 
payments shall:
    (1) Bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the 
debtor's ability to pay; and
    (2) Normally be of sufficient size and frequency to liquidate the 
debt in not more than three years.
    (b) Except as otherwise determined by FSA, no installment 
arrangement will be considered unless the debtor submits a certified 
financial statement which reflects the debtor's assets, liabilities, 
income, and expenses. The financial statement shall not be required to 
be submitted sooner than 15 workdays following its request by FSA.
    (c) All installment payment agreements shall be in writing and 
require the payment of interest at the late payment interest rate in 
effect on the date such agreement is executed, unless such interest is 
waived or reduced by FSA. The installment agreement shall specify all 
the terms of the arrangement and include provision for accelerating the 
debt in the event the debtor defaults.
    (d) FSA may deem a repayment plan to be abrogated if the debtor 
fails to comply with its terms.
    (e) If the debtor's financial statement or other information 
discloses the ownership of assets which are not encumbered, the debtor 
may be required to secure the payment of an installment note by 
executing a security agreement and financing agreement which provides 
FSA a security interest in the assets until the debt is paid in full.
    (f) If the debtor owes more than one debt to FSA, FSA may allow the 
debtor to designate the manner in which a voluntary installment payment 
is to be

[[Page 194]]

applied. If the debtor does not designate the application of a voluntary 
installment or partial payment, the payment will be applied to such 
debts as determined by FSA.

Sec. 792.7  Collection by administrative offset.

    (a) The provisions of this section shall apply to all debts due FSA 
except as otherwise provided in this part and part 1404 of this title. 
This section is not applicable to:
    (1) FSA requests for administrative offset against money payable to 
a debtor from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund and FSA 
requests for salary offset against a present, former or retired employee 
of the Federal Government which shall be made in accordance with 
regulations at part 3 of this title;
    (2) FSA requests for administrative offset against a Federal income 
tax refund payable to a debtor which shall be made in accordance with 
Sec. 792.19;
    (3) Cases in which FSA must adjust, by increasing or decreasing, a 
payment which is to be paid under a contract in order to properly make 
other payments due by FSA; and
    (4) Any case in which a statute explicitly provides for or prohibits 
using administrative offset to collect the debt for the type of debt 
involved.
    (b) Debts due FSA or CCC may be collected by administrative offset 
from amounts payable by FSA when:
    (1) The debtor has been provided written notification of the basis 
and amount of the debt and has been given an opportunity to make 
payment. Such written notification and opportunity includes notice of 
the right to pursue an administrative appeal in accordance with part 780 
of this chapter or any other applicable appeal procedures, if not 
previously provided;
    (2) The debtor has been provided an opportunity to request to 
inspect and copy the records of FSA related to the debt;
    (3) The debtor has been given the opportunity to enter into a 
written agreement which is acceptable to FSA for repayment of the debt;
    (4) The debtor has been notified in writing that the debt will be 
collected by administrative offset if not paid; and
    (5) The debt has not been delinquent for more than ten years or 
legal action to enforce the debt has not been barred by an applicable 
period of limitation, whichever is later.
    (c) Administrative offset shall also be effected against amounts 
payable by FSA:
    (1) When requested or approved by the Department of Justice; or
    (2) When a person is indebted under a judgment in favor of FSA or 
the United States.
    (d) A payment due any person may be offset when there is a breach of 
a contract or a violation of FSA program requirements, and offset is 
considered necessary by FSA to protect the financial interests of the 
Government.
    (e) FSA may effect administrative offset against a payment to be 
made to a debtor prior to completion of the procedures required by 
paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section if:
    (1) Failure to take the offset would substantially prejudice FSA' 
ability to collect the debt; and
    (2) The time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably 
permit the completion of those procedures.
    (f)(1) Judgments in favor of the United States may be offset against 
any amounts payable by FSA based on information provided by or obtained 
from the Department of Justice. Debts due any agency other than FSA 
which have not been reduced to judgment shall be offset against amounts 
payable by FSA to a debtor when an agency of the U.S. Government has 
submitted a written request for offset which is mailed or hand-delivered 
to the appropriate FSA State office, Kansas City Financial Management 
Office, Kansas City Management Office, or Kansas City Commodity Office. 
Such written request must:
    (i) Bear the signature of an authorized representative of the 
requesting agency;
    (ii) Include a certification that all requirements of the law and 
the regulations for collection of the debt and for requesting offset 
have been complied with;

[[Page 195]]

    (iii) State the name, address (including county), and, where legally 
available, the Social Security number or employer ID number of the 
debtor, and a brief description of the basis of the debt, including 
identification of the judgment, if any;
    (iv) State the amount of the debt separately as to principal, 
interest, penalties, and administrative costs. Interest, if any, shall 
be computed on a daily basis to a date shown in the request. The amount 
to be offset shall not exceed the principal sum owed by the debtor, plus 
interest computed in accordance with the request, and any late payment 
interest, penalties and administrative costs that have been assessed;
    (v) Certify that the debtor has not filed for bankruptcy. If the 
debtor has filed for bankruptcy, a copy of the order of the bankruptcy 
court relieving the agency from the automatic stay must be included; and
    (vi) State the name, address, and telephone number of a contact 
person within the agency and the address to which payment should be 
sent.
    (2) Unless prohibited by law, the head of an agency, or a designee, 
may defer or subordinate in whole or in part the right of the agency to 
recover through offset all or part of any indebtedness to such agency, 
or may withdraw a request for offset. Notice of such action must be sent 
to the appropriate FSA office.
    (g)(1) After FSA has complied with the provisions of this part, FSA 
may request other agencies of the Government to offset amounts payable 
by them to persons indebted to FSA.
    (2) In the case of a request to IRS for a tax refund offset, the 
provisions at Sec. 792.19 shall apply.
    (h)(1) Debts shall be collected by offset in the following order of 
priority without regard to the date of the request for such collection:
    (i) Debts to FSA.
    (ii) Debts to other agencies of USDA as determined by FSA.
    (iii) Debts to other government agencies as determined by FSA.
    (2) In the case of multiple debts involving the same debtor, FSA 
may, at its discretion, deviate from the usual order of priority in 
applying recovered amounts to debts owed other agencies when considered 
to be in the Government's best interest. Such decision shall be made by 
FSA based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case.
    (i) Amounts recovered by offset for FSA and CCC debts but later 
found not to be owed to the Government shall be promptly refunded.
    (j) The debtor shall be notified whenever any offset action has been 
taken.
    (k) Offsets made pursuant to this section shall not deprive a debtor 
of any right he or she might otherwise have to contest the debt involved 
in the offset action either by administrative appeal or by legal action.
    (l) Any action authorized by the provisions of this section may be 
taken:
    (1) Against a debtor's pro rata share of payments due any entity 
which the debtor participates in, either directly or indirectly, as 
determined by FSA.
    (2) When FSA determines that the debtor has established an entity, 
or reorganized, transferred ownership of, or changed in some other 
manner, their operation, for the purpose of avoiding the payment of the 
claim or debt.
    (m) The amount to be offset shall not exceed the actual or estimated 
amount of the debt, including interest, administrative charges, and 
penalties, unless the Department of Justice requests that a larger 
specified amount be offset.
    (n) Offset action will not be taken against payments when:
    (1) A debt has been discharged as provided in Sec. 792.16.
    (2) FSA determines such action will unduly interfere with the 
administration of an FSA or CCC program.
    (3) The debt has been delinquent for more than ten years or legal 
action to enforce the debt due FSA is barred by an applicable period of 
limitation, whichever is later.

Sec. 792.8  Priorities of offsets versus assignments.

    (a) No amounts payable to a debtor by FSA shall be paid to an 
assignee until there have been collected any amounts owed by the debtor 
except as provided in this section.

[[Page 196]]

    (b) A payment which is assigned in accordance with part 1404 of this 
title by execution of Form CCC-36 shall be subject to offset for any 
debt owed to FSA or CCC or any judgment in favor of the United States 
without regard to the date notice of assignment was accepted by FSA or 
CCC.
    (c) A payment which is assigned in accordance with part 1404 of this 
title by execution of Form CCC-252 shall be offset:
    (1) Against any debt of the assignor entered on the debt record of 
the applicable FSA office prior to the filing of such form with FSA or 
CCC, or
    (2) At anytime, regardless of the date of filing of such form with 
FSA or CCC, if the debt which is the basis for the offset arises from a 
judgment in favor of the United States, or under the same contract under 
which the payment is earned by the assignor.
    (d) With respect to all other Federal agencies, offset shall be made 
of any amounts due any other Federal agency which have not been reduced 
to judgment, and which are entered on the debt record of the appropriate 
FSA office prior to the date the notice of assignment was accepted by 
FSA or CCC.
    (e) Any amount due and payable to the assignor which remains after 
deduction of amounts paid to the assignee shall be available for offset.


<R05>
Sec. 792.9  Withholding.

    (a) Withholding of a payment prior to the completion of an 
applicable offset procedure may be made from amounts payable to a debtor 
by FSA to ensure that the interests of FSA and the United States will be 
protected as provided in this section.
    (b) A payment may be withheld to protect the interests of FSA or the 
United States only if FSA determines that:
    (1) There has been a serious breach of contract or violation of 
program requirements and the withholding action is considered necessary 
to protect the financial interests of FSA;
    (2) There is substantial evidence of violations of criminal or civil 
frauds statutes and criminal prosecution or civil frauds action is of 
primary importance to program operations of FSA;
    (3) Prior experience with the debtor indicates that collection will 
be difficult if amounts payable to the debtor are not withheld;
    (4) There is doubt that the debtor will be financially able to pay a 
judgment on the claim of FSA;
    (5) The facts available to FSA are insufficient to determine the 
amount to be offset or the proper payee;
    (6) A judgment on a claim of FSA has been obtained; or
    (7) Such action has been requested by the Department of Justice.
    (c) Except for debts due FSA or CCC, withholding action by FSA on 
amounts payable to debtors of other Government agencies may not be made 
unless requested by the Department of Justice.


<R05>
Sec. 792.10  Late payment interest, penalty and administrative charges.

    (a) Late payment interest provisions of this section shall not 
apply:
    (1) To debts owed by Federal agencies and State and local 
governments. Interest on debts owed by such entities shall be charged to 
the extent authorized under the common law or applicable statutory 
authority.
    (2) If an applicable statute, regulation, agreement, or contract 
either prohibits the charging of such interest or specifies the interest 
or charges applicable to the debt involved;
    (3) If the late payment interest is waived by FSA in accordance with 
Sec. 792.11.
    (4) To administrative charges as set forth in paragraph (f) of this 
section.
    (b) FSA will assess late payment interest on the full amount of 
delinquent debts. For purposes of this section, the term ``full amount 
of the delinquent debt'' means the sum of the principal, accrued program 
interest, and any other charges which are otherwise due and owing to FSA 
on the delinquent debt at the time the late payment interest is 
assessed, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (d)(3) of this 
section.
    (c) The late payment interest shall be expressed as an annual rate 
of interest which FSA charges on delinquent debts. The late payment 
interest rate shall be equal to the higher of the Treasury Department's 
current value

[[Page 197]]

of funds rate or the rate of interest assessed under the Prompt Payment 
Act, determined as of the date specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) 
of this section. The rate of interest assessed under the Prompt Payment 
Act was chosen as an alternative rate to ensure that the Government 
would recoup interest at a rate which was at least as high as that which 
it pays for late payments.
    (d)(1) When a debt results from a statute, regulation, contract, or 
other agreement with specific provisions for late payment interest and 
payment due date, late payment interest shall accrue on the amount of 
the debt from the first day the debt became delinquent, unless otherwise 
provided by statute.
    (2) With respect to debts not resulting from a statute, regulation, 
contract, or agreement containing specific provisions for late payment 
interest and payment due date, late payment interest shall begin to 
accrue from the date on which notice of the debt, including notice of 
late payment interest, is first mailed or hand-delivered to the debtor.
    (3) The rate of late payment interest initially assessed will be 
fixed for the duration of the indebtedness, except when a debtor has 
defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new 
agreement. FSA may then set a new rate of interest which reflects the 
late payment interest rate in effect at the time the new agreement is 
executed. All charges which accrued, but which were not collected under 
the defaulted agreement, shall be added to the principal to be paid 
under a new repayment agreement.
    (4) The late payment interest on delinquent debts will accrue on a 
daily basis.
    (e) Except as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a 
penalty charge of three (3) percent per annum will be assessed on any 
portion of a debt which remains unpaid ninety (90) days after the date 
described in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, if no repayment 
schedule satisfactory to FSA has been agreed upon. Such penalty charge 
will be assessed retroactively from the date late payment interest began 
to accrue and applied on a daily basis. Such rate shall continue to 
accrue until the delinquent debt has been paid.
    (f) FSA shall assess as administrative charges the additional costs 
of processing delinquent debts against the debtor, to the extent such 
costs are attributable to the delinquency. Such costs include, but are 
not limited to, costs incurred in obtaining a credit report, costs of 
employing commercial firms to locate debtor, costs of employing 
contractors for collection services, costs of selling collateral or 
property to satisfy the debt.
    (g) When a debt is paid in partial or installment payments, payments 
will be applied first to administrative charges, second to the penalty 
charge assessed in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section and 
late payment interest, and third to outstanding principal.


<R05>
Sec. 792.11  Waiver of late payment interest, penalty charge and 
administrative charges.

    (a) FSA shall waive the collection of late payment interest and 
administrative charges on a debt or any portion of a debt which is paid 
within 30 days after the date on which late payment interest began to 
accrue.
    (b) FSA may waive the assessment and collection of all or a portion 
of the penalty charge on debts which are appealed in accordance with 7 
CFR part 780 or other applicable appeal procedures from either the date 
of the appeal or the date such interest began to accrue, whichever is 
later, until the date a final administrative determination is issued. 
Such waiver shall not apply for any delay due to:
    (1) The appellant's request for a postponement of the scheduled 
hearing;
    (2) The appellant's request for an additional time following the 
hearing to present additional information or a written closing 
statement; or
    (3) The appellant's failure to timely present information to the 
reviewing authority.
    (c) Assessment and collection of late payment interest, the penalty 
charge and administrative charges under this part may be waived by FSA 
in full, or in part, if it is determined by the Controller, FSA, or his 
or her designee,

[[Page 198]]

that such action is in the best interest of FSA.


<R05>
Sec. 792.12  Administrative appeal.

    If the opportunity to appeal the determination has not previously 
been provided under part 24 of this title or part 780 of this chapter or 
any other appeal procedure, a debtor may obtain an administrative review 
under part 780 of this chapter, or other applicable appeal procedures, 
of FSA' determination concerning the existence or amount of a debt, if a 
request is filed with the authority who made the determination within 15 
days of the date of FSA' initial demand letter, unless a longer period 
is specified in the initial demand letter.


<R05>

administrative or contractual remedy which may be available to FSA to 
collect debts owed to the Government.


<R05>
Sec. 792.14  Contact with debtor's employing agency.

    When a debtor is employed by the Federal Government or is a member 
of the military establishment or the Coast Guard, and collection by 
offset cannot be accomplished in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5514, FSA may 
contact the employing agency to arrange for payment of the debt by 
allotment or otherwise, in accordance with section 206 of Executive 
Order No. 11222, May 8, 1965, 30 FR 6469, 3 CFR, 1964-1965 Comp., p 306.


<R05>
Sec. 792.15  Prior provision of rights with respect to debt.

regulation before:
    (a) Effecting administrative offset;

agencies;
    (c) Referring the debt for salary offset against the current pay of 
a present or former Government employee; or

debt or part thereof owed FSA shall be discharged with the concurrence 
of the Department of Justice, if applicable, and the records and 
accounts on that debt closed in the following situations:
    (1) When an obligation or part thereof is discharged in bankruptcy;
    (2) When an obligation or part thereof is the subject of a final 
judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction which is adverse 
to FSA and no appeal will be taken by FSA;
    (3) When a debt or part thereof is compromised and paid, the amount 
of such compromise;
    (4) When collection of a debt by administrative offset is barred in 
accordance with Sec. 792.7(b)(5).
    (b) Debts discharged in accordance with this section may be reported 
to the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to Sec. 792.20.

Sec. 792.17  Referral of delinquent debts to credit reporting agencies.

    (a) This section specifies the procedures that will be followed by 
FSA and the rights that will be afforded to debtors when FSA reports 
delinquent debts to credit reporting agencies.
    (b) Before disclosing information to a credit reporting agency in 
accordance with this part, FSA shall review the claim and determine that 
it is valid and delinquent.
    (c) Before a debt may be referred to a credit reporting agency, the 
debtor must be notified, pursuant to Sec. 792.4, of FSA' intent to make 
such a report. Such notification shall include:
    (1) FSA' intent to disclose to a credit reporting agency that the 
debtor is responsible for the debt, and that such disclosure will be 
made not less than 60 days after notification to such debtor.
    (2) The information intended to be disclosed to the credit reporting

    (e)(1) FSA shall notify each credit reporting agency to which an 
original disclosure of delinquent debt information was made of any 
substantial change in the condition or amount of the claim.
    (2) FSA shall promptly verify or correct, as appropriate, 
information about the debt on request of a credit reporting agency. The

    (2) The amount, status, and history of the claim; and
    (3) The program under which the claim arose.
    (h) Reasonable action shall be taken to locate a debtor for whom FSA 
does not have a current address before reporting delinquent debt

    (i)(1) Before disclosing delinquent debt information to a credit 
reporting agency, FSA shall, upon request of the debtor, provide for a

regarding the appropriateness of disclosure to a credit reporting agency 
is made.
    (3) Upon completion of the review, the reviewing official shall

reporting agencies to which information will be provided are in 
compliance with the provisions of all the laws and regulations of the 
United States relating to providing credit information.

<R05>
Sec. 795.4  Family members.

    Effective for the 1987 through 1990 crops, an individual shall not 
be denied a determination that such individual was a ``person'' solely 
on the basis that:
    (a) A family member cosigns for, or makes a loan to, such individual 
and leases, loans or gives equipment, land or labor to such an 
individual; and
    (b) Such family members were organized as separate units prior to

<R05>
Sec. 795.5  Timing for determining status of persons.

    Except as otherwise set forth in this part, the status of 
individuals or entities as of March 1, or such other date as may be 
determined and announced by the Administrator shall be the basis on

[[Page 202]]


<R05>
Sec. 795.6  Multiple individuals or other entities.

    The rules in Sec. Sec. 795.5 through 795.16 shall be used to 
determine whether certain multiple individuals or legal entities are to 
be treated as one person or as separate persons for the purpose of 
applying the limitation. In cases in which more than one rule would 
appear to be applicable, the rule which is most restrictive on the 
number of persons shall apply.


<R05>
Sec. 795.7  Entities or joint operations not considered as a person.

    A partnership, joint venture, tenants-in-common, or joint tenants 
shall not be considered as a person but, notwithstanding the provisions 
of Sec. 795.3, each individual or other legal entity who shares in the 
proceeds derived from farming by such joint operations shall be 
considered a separate person, except as otherwise provided in this part, 
and shall be listed as a producer for payment purposes on program 
documents. The payment shares listed on the program documents for each 
individual or other legal entity shall be the same as each individual or 
other legal entity shares in the proceeds derived from farming by such 
joint operation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each individual or other 
legal entity who shares in the proceeds derived from farming by such 
joint operation shall not be considered as a separate person unless the 
individual or other legal entity is actively engaged in the farming 
operations of the partnership or other joint operation. An individual or 
other legal entity shall be considered as actively engaged in the 
farming operation only if its contribution to the joint operation is 
commensurate with its share in the proceeds derived from farming by such 
joint operation. Members of the partnership or joint venture must 
furnish satisfactory evidence that their contributions of land, labor, 
management, equipment, or capital to the joint operation are 
commensurate with their claimed shares of the proceeds. A capital 
contribution may be a direct out-of-pocket input of a specified sum or 
an amount borrowed by the individual. If the contribution consists 
substantially of capital, such capital must have been contributed 
directly to the joint operation by the individual or other legal entity 
and not acquired as a result of (a) a loan made to the joint operation, 
(b) a loan which was made to such individual or other legal entity by 
the joint operation or any of its members or related entities, or (c) a 
loan made to such individual or other legal entity which was guaranteed 
by the joint operation or any of its members or related entities.


<R05>
Sec. 795.8  Corporations and stockholders.

    (a) A corporation (including a limited partnership) shall be 
considered as one person, and an individual stockholder of the 
corporation may be considered as a separate person to the extent that 
such stockholder is engaged in the production of the crop as a separate 
producer and otherwise meets the requirements of Sec. 795.3, except 
that a corporation in which more than 50 percent of the stock is owned 
by an individual (including the stock owned by the individual's spouse, 
minor children, and trusts for the benefit of such minor children), or 
by a legal entity, shall not be considered as a separate person from 
such individual or legal entity.
    (b) Where the same two or more individuals or other legal entities 
own more than 50 percent of the stock in each of two or more 
corporations, all such corporations shall be considered as one person.
    (c) The percentage share of the value of the stock owned by an 
individual or other legal entity shall be determined as of March 1 of 
the crop year, except that where a stockholder voluntarily acquires 
stock after March 1 and before the harvest of the crop, the amount of 
any stock so acquired shall be included in determining the percentage 
share of the value of the stock owned by the stockholder. Where there is 
only one class of stock, a stockholder's percentage share of the value 
of the outstanding stock shall be equal to the percentage of the 
outstanding stock owned by the stockholder. If the corporation has more 
than one class of stock the percentage share of the value of the stock 
owned by a stockholder shall be determined by the Deputy Administrator 
on the basis of market quotations, and if market quotations

[[Page 203]]

are lacking or too scarce to be recognized the percentage share of the 
value of the stock shall be determined by the Deputy Administrator on 
the basis of all relevant factors affecting the fair market value, 
including the rights and privileges of the various stock issues.

<R05>
Sec. 795.9  Estate or trust.

    (a) An estate or irrevocable trust shall be considered as one person 
except that, where two or more estates or irrevocable trusts have common 
beneficiaries or heirs (including spouses and minor children) with more 
than a 50-percent interest, all such estates or irrevocable trusts shall 
be considered as one person.
    (b) An individual heir of an estate or beneficiary of a trust may be 
considered as a separate person to the extent that such heir or 
beneficiary is engaged in the production of crops as a separate producer 
and otherwise meets the requirements of Sec. 795.3, except that an 
estate or irrevocable trust which has a sole heir or beneficiary shall 
not be considered as a separate person from such heir or beneficiary.
    (c) Where an irrevocable trust or an estate is a producer on a farm 
and one or more of the beneficiaries or heirs of such trust or estate 
are minor children, the minor children's pro rata share of the program 
payments to the trust or estate shall be attributed to the parent of the 
minor children except as otherwise provided in Sec. 795.12.
    (d) A revocable trust shall not be considered as a separate person 
from the grantor.


<R05>
Sec. 795.10  Club, society, fraternal or religious organization.

    Each individual club, society, fraternal or religious organization 
may be considered as a separate person to the extent that each such 
club, society, fraternal or religious organization is engaged in the 
production of crops as a separate producer and otherwise meets the 
requirements of Sec. 795.3.


<R05>
Sec. 795.11  Husband and wife.

    With respect to the 1988 crop year, a husband and wife shall be 
considered to be one person except that such individuals who, prior to 
their marriage, were separately engaged in unrelated farming operations 
will be determined to be separate persons with respect to such farming 
operations so long as the operations remain separate and distinct from 
any farming operation conducted by the other spouse if such individuals 
have executed a Contract to Participate in the 1988 Price Support and 
Production Adjustment Programs by April 15, 1988. Such individuals must 
file a form FSA-561 with the county committee for each such farming 
operation by July 8, 1988, if they desire to be considered as separate 
persons under this section.

[53 FR 21410, June 8, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 795.12  Minor children.

    (a) A minor child and his parents or guardian (or other person 
responsible for him) shall be considered as one person, except that the 
minor child may be considered as a separate person if such minor child 
is a producer on a farm in which the parents or guardian or other person 
responsible for him (including any entity in which the parents or 
guardian or other person responsible for him has a substantial interest, 
i.e., more than a 20-percent interest) takes no part in the operation of 
the farm (including any activities as a custom farmer) and owns no 
interest in the farm or allotment or in any portion of the production on 
the farm, and if such minor child:
    (1) Is represented by a court-appointed guardian who is required by 
law to make a separate accounting for the minor and ownership of the 
farm is vested in the minor, or
    (2) Has established and maintains a different household from his 
parents or guardian and personally carries out the actual farming 
operations on the farm for which there is a separate accounting, or

[[Page 204]]

    (3) Has a farming operation resulting from his being the beneficiary 
of an irrevocable trust and ownership of the property is vested in the 
trust or the minor.
    (b) A person shall be considered a minor until he reaches 18 years 
of age. Court proceedings conferring majority on a person under 18 years 
of age will not change such person's status as a minor for purposes of 
applying the regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 795.13  Other cases.

    Where the county committee is unable to determine whether certain 
individuals or legal entities involved in the production of a commodity 
are to be treated as one person or separate persons, all the facts 
regarding the arrangement under which the commodity is produced shall be 
submitted to the State committee for decision. Where the State committee 
is unable to determine whether such individuals or legal entities are to 
be treated as one person or separate persons, all the facts regarding 
the arrangement under which the farming operation is conducted shall be 
submitted to the Deputy Administrator for decision.


<R05>
Sec. 795.14  Changes in farming operations.

    (a) Subject to the provisions of this part, a person may exercise 
his or her right heretofore existing under law, to divide, sell, 
transfer, rent, or lease his or her property if such division, sale, 
transfer, rental arrangement, or lease is legally binding as between the 
parties thereto. However, any document representing a division, sale, 
transfer, rental arrangement, or lease which is fictitious or not 
legally binding as between the parties thereto shall be considered to be 
for the purpose of evading the payment limitation and shall be 
disregarded for the purpose of applying the payment limitation. Any 
change in farming operations that would otherwise serve to increase the 
number of persons for application of the payment limitation must be bona 
fide and substantive.
    (b) A substantive change includes, for example, a substantial 
increase or decrease in the size of the farm by purchase, sale, or 
lease; a substantial increase or decrease in the size of allotment by 
purchase, sale, or lease; a change from a cash lease to a share lease or 
vice versa; and dissolution of an entity such as a corporation or 
partnership.
    (c) Examples of the types of changes that would not be considered as 
substantive are the following:

    Example 1. A corporation is owned equally by four shareholders. The 
corporation owns land, buildings, and equipment and in the prior year 
carried out substantial farming operations. Three of the shareholders 
propose forming a partnership which they would own equally. The 
partnership would cash lease land and equipment from the corporation 
with the objective of having the three partners considered as separate 
persons for purposes of applying the payment limitation under the 
provisions of Sec. 795.7 of the regulations.
    The formation of such a partnership and the leasing of land from a 
corporation in which they hold a major interest would not constitute a 
substantive and bona fide change in operations. Therefore, the 
corporation and the partners would be limited to a single payment 
limitation.
    Example 2. Three individuals each have individual farming operations 
which, if continued unchanged, would permit them to have a total of 
three payment limitations.
    The three individuals propose forming a corporation which they would 
own equally. The corporation would then cash lease a portion of the 
farmland owned and previously operated by the individuals with the 
objective of having the corporation considered as a separate person for 
purposes of applying the payment limitation under the provisions of 
Sec. 795.8 of the regulations. The formation of such a corporation and 
the leasing of land from the stockholders would not constitute a 
substantive and bona fide change in operations. Therefore, the 
corporation and the three individuals would be limited to three payment 
limitations.


<R05>
Sec. 795.15  Determining whether agreement is a share lease or a cash 
lease.

    (a) Cash lease. If a rental agreement contains provisions for a 
guaranteed minimum rental with respect to the amount of rent to be paid 
to the landlord by a tenant, such agreement shall be considered to be a 
cash rental agreement. In addition, the rental agreement must be 
customary and reasonable for the area.
    (b) Share lease. If a rental agreement contains provisions that 
require the

[[Page 205]]

payment of rent on the basis of the amount of the crop produced or the 
proceeds derived from the crop, such agreement shall be considered to be 
a share rental agreement. In addition, the rental agreement must be 
customary and reasonable for the area.

<R05>
Sec. 795.16  Custom farming.

    (a) Custom farming is the performance of services on a farm such as 
land preparation, seeding, cultivating, applying pesticides, and 
harvesting for hire with remuneration on a unit of work basis, except 
that, for the purpose of applying the provisions of this section, the 
harvesting of crops and the application of agricultural chemicals by 
firms regularly engaged in such businesses shall not be regarded as 
custom farming. A person performing custom farming shall be considered 
as being separate from the person for whom the custom farming is 
performed only if:
    (1) The compensation for the custom farming is paid at a unit of 
work rate customary in the area and is in no way dependent upon the 
amount of the crop produced, and (2) the person performing the custom 
farming (and any other entity in which such person has more than a 20-
percent interest) has no interest, directly or indirectly, (i) in the 
crop on the farm by taking any risk in the production of the crop, 
sharing in the proceeds of the crop, granting or guaranteeing the 
financing of the crop, (ii) in the allotment on the farm, or (iii) in 
the farm as landowner, landlord, mortgage holder, trustee, lienholder, 
guarantor, agent, manager, tenant, sharecropper, or any other similar 
capacity.
    (b) A person having more than a 20-percent interest in any legal 
entity performing custom farming shall be considered as being separate 
from the person for whom the custom farming is performed only if:
    (1) The compensation for the custom farming service is paid at a 
unit of work rate customary in the area and is in no way dependent upon 
the amount of the crop produced, and (2) the person having such interest 
in the legal entity performing the custom farming has no interest, 
directly or indirectly, (i) in the crop on the farm by taking any risk 
in the production of the crop, sharing in the proceeds of the corp, 
granting or guaranteeing the financing of the crop, (ii) in the 
allotment on the farm, or (iii) in the farm as landowner, landlord, 
mortgage holder, trustee, lienholder, guarantor, agent, manager, tenant, 
sharecropper, or in any other similar capacity.


<R05>
Sec. 795.17  Scheme or device.

    All or any part of the payments otherwise due a person under the 
upland cotton, wheat, feed grain and rice programs on all farms in which 
the person has an interest may be withheld or required to be refunded if 
the person adopts or participates in adopting any scheme or device 
designed to evade or which has the effect of evading the rules of this 
part. Such acts shall include, but are not limited to, concealing from 
the county committee any information having a bearing on the application 
of the rules of this part or submitting false information to the county 
committee (for example, a set-aside agreement which is entered into that 
differs from information furnished to the county committee concerning 
the manner in which program payments are actually shared, concerning the 
actual facts of a sale, or concerning the transfer of property) or 
creating fictitious entities for the purpose of concealing the interest 
of a person in a farming operation.


<R05>
Sec. 795.20  Joint and several liability.

    Where two or more individuals or legal entities, who are treated as 
one person hereunder, receive payments which in the aggregate exceed the 
limitation, such individuals or legal entities shall be liable, jointly 
and severally, for any liability arising therefrom. The provisions of 
this part requiring the refund of payments shall be applicable in 
addition to any liability under criminal and civil fraud statutes.


<R05>
Sec. 795.21  Appeals.

    Any person may obtain reconsideration and review of determinations 
made under this part in accordance with the appeal regulations, part 780 
of this chapter, as amended.

limitation regulations and published at 36 FR 16569, 37 FR 3049, 39 FR 
15021 and 41 FR 17527 shall be applicable in construing the provisions 
of this part.

    The information collection requirements contained in these 
regulations (7 CFR part 795) have been approved by the Office of

<R05>
Sec. 795.24  Relief.

    If a producer relied on a county committee and/or State committee 
``person'' determination for a crop year and higher reviewing authority 
makes a more restrictive determination, the Deputy Administrator may 
grant relief only for such crop year if the producer was not afforded an 
opportunity to exercise other alternatives with respect to the 
producer's farming operation and the program provisions and the county 
committee has determined that the producers acted in good faith based 
upon the original ``person'' determination.

Sec. 799.1  Background.

    The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 
et seq.) establishes national policies and goals for the protection of 
the environment. Section 102(2) of NEPA contains certain procedural 
requirements directed toward the attainment of such goals. Section 
(102)(2) also requires all Federal agencies to give appropriate 
consideration to the environmental effects of their proposed actions in 
their decisionmaking and to prepare detailed environmental statements on 
recommendations or reports on proposals for legislation and other major 
Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human 
environment. Executive Order 11991 of May 24, 1977 (42 FR 26967), 
directed the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to issue regulations 
to implement the procedural provisions of NEPA. Accordingly, CEQ issued 
final NEPA regulations (40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508) on November 29, 
1978, which are binding on all Federal agencies as of July 30, 1979. 
These regulations provide that each Federal agency shall as necessary 
adopt implementing procedures to supplement the regulations. The U.S. 
Department of Agriculture adopted such procedures in a final rule (7 CFR 
part 3100) published on July 30, 1979. The CEQ regulations at 40 CFR 
1507.3 (b) identify those items which must be addressed in agency 
procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 799.2  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to establish agency procedures which 
supplement NEPA regulations issued by CEQ and USDA. This regulation, 
together with such NEPA regulations issued by CEQ and USDA, will 
supersede regulations issued by the Farm Service Agency (FSA) on 
December 20, 1974 (39 FR 43996).


<R05>
Sec. 799.3  Applicability.

    This part, together with NEPA regulations issued by CEQ and USDA, 
applies to all programs administered by FSA which might have significant 
impacts on the environment.


<R05>
Sec. 799.4  Definitions.

    (a) The term environmental evaluation means agency appraisal of the 
potential or likely environmental impacts of proposed legislation, a new 
program, a major change in a program, an action related to a program or 
an action related to part of a program which will be used by the 
responsible agency official to determine whether or not an environmental 
assessment and/or an environmental impact statement is needed. Such 
appraisal shall relate to the same environmental concerns as an 
environmental impact statement. The environmental evaluation shall 
particularly

[[Page 210]]

focus on the adverse affects of FSA actions on the environmental factors 
listed on Form FSA-929 (see Appendix 2) and on the significance of the 
action as discussed in the CEQ regulations concerning NEPA at 40 CFR 
1508.27. As required, the environmental evaluation shall be made by an 
interdisciplinary team.
    (b) In the regulations in this part and in all instructions, forms, 
and documents in connection therewith, all other words and phrases 
shall, unless the context or subject matter otherwise requires, have the 
meanings assigned to them in the regulations governing reconstitution of 
farms, allotments and bases, part 719 of this chapter, as amended.


<R05>
Sec. 799.5  FSA officials and offices responsible for carrying out NEPA.

    (a) Responsible officials. The Administrator of FSA, or his or her 
designee, is the responsible Federal official for carrying out the 
purpose of NEPA for all FSA programs. County committees, State 
committees, and Directors of Washington Divisions, within their 
respective areas of responsibility with the assistance of the FSA 
representative on the USDA Environmental Quality Committee, shall assist 
the Administrator in complying with the policies and purposes of NEPA 
generally, and, in particular, in determining whether the quality of the 
human environment will be significantly affected in implementing agency 
programs and preparing the necessary environmental documents.
    (b) Offices responsible for carrying out NEPA--(1) Washington 
divisions. Washington divisions are responsible for carrying out NEPA 
with regard to legislative proposals and multi-State and national 
programs or major revisions of national programs.
    (2) State committees. State committees are responsible for carrying 
out NEPA with regard to major actions in a State or area within a State.
    (3) County committees. County committees are responsible for 
carrying out NEPA with regard to major actions within a county.
    (c) All environmental assessments, environmental impact statements 
(EISs) and similar documents will be forwarded through the appropriate 
agency channels to the FSA representative on the USDA Environmental 
Quality Committee for review and submission to the Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 799.6  Adoption of regulations issued by others in implementing 
the procedural provisions of NEPA.

    In addition to provisions provided for in this part 799, FSA adopts 
the NEPA regulations issued by CEQ (40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508) and 
NEPA regulations issued by USDA (7 CFR part 3100).


<R05>
Sec. 799.7  Early involvement in private and state and local activities 
requiring Federal approval.

    (a) The NEPA regulations at 40 CFR 1501.2(d) require agencies to 
provide for early involvement in actions which, while planned by private 
applicants or other non-Federal entities, require some form of Federal 
involvement.
    (b) To implement the requirements of 40 CFR 1501.2(d) with respect 
to these actions FSA shall:
    (1) Prepare, where practicable, generic guidelines describing the 
scope and level of environmental information required from applicants 
seeking assistance from FSA as a basis for evaluating their proposed 
actions, and make these guidelines available upon request.
    (2) Provide such guidance on a project-by-project basis to 
applicants seeking assistance from FSA.
    (3) Upon receipt of an application for agency approval, or 
notification that an application will be filed, consult as required with 
other appropriate parties to initiate and coordinate the necessary 
environmental analyses.
    (c) The responsibilities under this section shall be coordinated by 
the Conservation and Environmental Protection Division of the Farm 
Service Agency, Washington, D.C.
    (d) To facilitate compliance with paragraph (a) of this section, 
private applicants seeking assistance from FSA and other non-Federal 
entities are expected to:
    (1) Contact FSA as early as possible in the planning process for 
guidance on the scope and level of environmental

[[Page 211]]

information required to be submitted in support of their application;
    (2) Conduct any studies which are deemed necessary and appropriate 
by FSA to determine the impact of the proposed action on the human 
environment;
    (3) Consult with appropriate Federal, regional, State and local 
agencies and other potentially interested parties during preliminary 
planning stages to ensure that all environmental factors are identified;
    (4) Submit applications for all Federal, regional, State and local 
approvals as early as possible in the planning process;
    (5) Notify FSA as early as possible of all other Federal, regional, 
State, local and Indian tribe actions required for project completion so 
that FSA may coordinate all Federal environmental reviews; and
    (6) Notify FSA of all known parties potentially affected by or 
interested in the proposed action.


<R05>
Sec. 799.8  Making supplements to EISs part of the final administrative 
record.

    Where FSA evaluates a proposal on the basis of a formal 
administrative record and an EIS on the proposal has been prepared, any 
supplement to the EIS shall be made a part of the formal record before a 
final decision on the proposal is made.


<R05>
Sec. 799.9  Ensuring that environmental factors are considered in agency 
decisionmaking.

    (a) The NEPA regulations at 40 CFR 1501.1 contain requirements to 
ensure adequate consideration of environmental factors in 
decisionmaking. To fulfill these requirements, FSA officials shall:
    (1) Consider all relevant environmental factors in evaluating 
proposals for agency action;
    (2) Make all relevant environmental documents, comments and 
responses part of the record in formal rulemaking or adjudicatory 
proceedings.
    (3) Ensure that all relevant environmental documents, comments and 
responses accompany the proposal through existing review processes;
    (4) Consider only those alternatives encompassed by the range of 
alternatives discussed in the relevant environmental documents when 
evaluating proposals for agency action.
    (5) Where an EIS has been prepared, consider the specific 
alternatives analyzed in the EIS when evaluating the proposal which is 
the subject of the EIS.
    (b) The four categories of FSA activities that have or are likely to 
have significant environment impacts on the human environment are:
    (1) Legislative proposals.
    (2) Initial program implementation.
    (3) Major changes in ongoing programs.
    (4) Major environmental concerns with ongoing programs.
    (c) Initial NEPA involvement in program categories in paragraph (b) 
of this section shall begin at the time FSA begins developing proposed 
legislation, begins the planning stage for implementing a new or changed 
program or receives notice that an ongoing program may have a 
significant adverse impact on the quality of the human environment. 
Where a legislative EIS or environmental assessment is part of the 
formal transmittal of a legislative program proposal to Congress, such 
legislative EIS or assessment may negate the need for the subsequent 
preparation of a program impact statement when FSA implements the 
resulting program. The decision whether such additional statement is 
needed will be made by an interdisciplinary team. The NEPA process on 
legislative proposals and FSA programs is carried out at the national 
level.
    (d) Individual farm participation in FSA programs will normally not 
require any major involvement with the NEPA process. The practices 
carried out under FSA programs that might have impacts on the quality of 
the human environment will normally have been discussed in environmental 
assessments or impact statements on the applicable programs. However, 
for those practices that might significantly affect the quality of the 
human environment, the county committee

[[Page 212]]

shall make an environmental evaluation before approval. If the 
environmental evaluation shows that the implementation of a proposed FSA 
practice on an individual farm will have significant adverse affects on 
the quality of the human environment, the county committee will not 
approve the practice implementation until after the completion of the 
NEPA-EIS process in accordance with this part. For those actions for 
which technical assistance is provided by an agency other than FSA, and 
such technical agency is required by its regulations to implement NEPA 
requirements when providing such assistance, the county committee shall 
use the environmental determination and considerations of such agency 
instead of duplicating the NEPA-EIS process. Individual farm 
participation in acreage set-aside, acreage allotments, price support 
and loans and other similar or related programs will not significantly 
affect the quality of the human environment.
    (e) Pooling agreements and special projects carried out under 
several FSA programs involving two or more farmers in a local geographic 
area will not normally require any major involvement with the NEPA 
process. However, the county committee shall, with the assistance of a 
local interdisciplinary team, as necessary, make an environmental 
evaluation of proposed pooling agreements or special projects that have 
a potential for significantly affecting the quality of the human 
environment. The NEPA process shall begin with the initial involvement 
of FSA personnel in the planning or development of pooling agreements or 
special projects. If it is determined from an environmental evaluation 
that the implementation of a proposed pooling agreement or a proposed 
special project will have a significant adverse impact on the quality of 
the human environment, the completion of the NEPA-EIS process in 
accordance with these regulations will be necessary before approval. For 
those actions for which technical assistance is provided by an agency 
other than FSA and such technical agency is required by its regulations 
to implement NEPA when providing such assistance the county committee 
shall use the environmental determinations and considerations of such 
agency instead of duplicating the NEPA-EIS process.


<R05>
Sec. 799.10  Criteria and identification of FSA actions as to degree of 
involvement under the NEPA process.

    (a) FSA will for each of its legislative proposals, initial program 
implementations, program changes or any actions under its ongoing 
programs make a determination by the use of an environmental evaluation 
as to whether or not an environmental assessment or EIS is required.
    (b) The NEPA regulations issued by CEQ at 40 CFR 1507.3(b)(2) in 
conjunction with the regulations at 40 CFR 1508.4 require agencies to 
determine those typical classes of actions for treatment under NEPA. The 
typical classes of FSA actions for treatment under NEPA are set forth as 
follows:
    (1) Actions normally requiring an EIS are:
    (i) Production adjustment programs to balance supply and demand of 
specified commodities, through cropland set-aside or other acreage 
diversion.
    (ii) Agricultural Conservation Program.
    (iii) Rural Clean Water Program.
    (iv) Other major actions that are determined after an environmental 
evaluation and/or an environmental assessment to significantly affect 
the quality of the human environment.
    (2) Actions normally not requiring an assessment or an EIS are:
    (i) Individual farm participation in FSA programs.
    (ii) Pooling agreements and special projects under FSA programs.
    (iii) Production adjustment programs for tobacco, peanuts and extra 
long staple cotton.
    (iv) Emergency Conservation Program.
    (v) Water Bank Program.
    (vi) Forestry Incentives Program.
    (vii) Sugar Program.
    (viii) Wool and Mohair Incentives Program.
    (ix) Bee and Dairy Indemnity Programs.
    (x) Commodity Income and Support and Disaster Protection Programs.
    (xi) Facility Loan Program.
    (xii) Grain Reserve Program.
    (xiii) Livestock Feed Program.

[[Page 213]]

    (xiv) Naval Stores Program.
    (xv) Indian Acute Distress Donation Program.
    (xvi) Other major actions that are determined after an environmental 
evaluation not to significantly affect the quality of the human 
environment.
    (c) FSA will independently determine by an environmental evaluation 
whether an environmental assessment or an EIS is required on actions 
included in paragraph (b) of this section where the presence of 
extraordinary circumstances or other unforseeable factors indicate that 
some other level of environmental review may be appropriate.
    (d) If an environmental evaluation indicates that an action will 
significantly affect the quality of the human environment, the 
preparation of an environmental assessment and/or an EIS will be 
necessary before the action is carried out.


<R05>
Sec. 799.11  Expedited procedures.

    Where emergency circumstances make it necessary to take action with 
significant environmental impact without following the provisions of the 
NEPA regulations issued by CEQ, USDA, and FSA, FSA will, by working 
through the USDA Office of Environmental Quality, consult with CEQ and/
or EPA about alternative arrangements (7 CFR 3100.35).


<R05>
Sec. 799.12  Program termination.

    An environmental assessment or an EIS will not be needed when a 
program or part of a program is discontinued because of a mandatory 
legislative requirement where the enabling legislation for such program 
does not provide authority to ameliorate or mitigate any resulting 
environmental effects on the quality of the human environment.


<R05>
Sec. 799.13  Environmental information.

    Interested persons may contact the Conservation and Environmental 
Protection Division, FSA, for information regarding FSA compliance with 
NEPA.

<R05>
Sec. 800.15  Services.

    (a) General. These regulations implement requirements for a national 
inspection and weighing system. This system promotes the uniform and 
accurate application of the official grain standards and provides 
inspection and weighing services required by the Act and as requested by 
applicants for official services. The types and kinds of services 
available under the Act and regulations can be obtained at all specified 
service points in the United States and on U.S. grain in Canadian ports.
    (b) Responsibilities for complying with the official inspection, 
aflatoxin testing, and weighing requirements.--(1) Export grain. 
Exporters are responsible for (i) complying with all inspection, Class X 
weighing, and other certification provisions and requirements of section 
5(a)(1) of the Act and the regulations applicable to export grain and 
(ii) having all corn, as defined in Sec. 810.401, exported from the 
United States tested

[[Page 229]]

for aflatoxin contamination unless the buyer and seller agree not to 
have the corn tested. The Service shall perform the aflatoxin testing 
service unless the buyer and seller agree to have the corn tested by an 
entity other than the Service.
    (2) Intercompany barges. Operators of export elevators at export 
port locations are responsible for complying with Class X weighing 
requirements and regulations covering intercompany grain shipments 
received by barge.
    (3) Grain in marked containers. When grain is in a container that 
bears an official grade designation or mark, the person who places the 
designation or mark on the container or the person who places the grain 
in a container that bears the designation or mark shall be responsible 
for determining that the grain has been inspected or weighed by official 
personnel and qualifies for the official grade designation or mark.
    (4) Grain for which representations have been made. Any person who 
makes a representation that (i) grain has been officially inspected or 
weighed; or (ii) grain has been officially inspected or weighed and 
found to be of a particular kind, class, quality, condition, or weight; 
or (iii) particular facts have been established with respect to the

Certificates, Official Export Grain Inspection Certificates, and 
Official Export Grain Weight Certificates for bulk or sacked grain shall 
be issued according to Sec. 800.162 for export grain loaded by an 
export elevator. Only these types of export certificates showing the 
official grade, official aflatoxin test results if required under the 
Act and the regulations, and/or the Class X weight of the grain shall be 
considered to be in compliance with inspection and weighing requirements 
under the Act for export grain.
    (b) Promptly furnished. Export certificates shall be considered 
promptly furnished if they are forwarded by the shipper or the shipper's 
agent to the consignee not later than 10 business days after issuance.

Sec. 800.17  Special inspection and weighing requirements for sacked 
export grain.

    (a) General. Subject to the provisions of Sec. 800.18, sacked 
export grain shall be (1) officially inspected on the basis of official 
samples obtained with an approved sampling device and operated in 
accordance with instructions, (2) Class X weighed or checkweighed, and 
(3) officially checkloaded by official personnel at the time the grain 
is loaded aboard the export carrier, in accordance with the provisions 
of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) Services at time of loading. When official sampling, official 
inspection, Class X weighing or checkweighing, and checkloading of 
sacked export grain loaded aboard an export carrier is performed at one 
location and time, official export inspection and weight certificate(s) 
which identify the export carrier shall be issued.
    (c) Services prior to loading. When official sampling, official 
inspection, and Class X weighing or checkweighing of sacked export grain 
is performed prior to the date of loading aboard an export carrier, 
official ``OUT'' certificates shall be issued. An examination by 
official personnel for condition and checkloading of the grain shall be 
made as the grain is loaded aboard the export carrier. If the 
examination for condition and the checkloading shows that the identity 
or quantity of the grain has not changed or the condition of the grain 
has not changed beyond expected variations prescribed in the 
instruction, official export inspection and weight certificates shall be 
issued on the basis of the official ``OUT'' certificates and the 
checkloading. If the identity, quantity, or the condition has changed, 
official export inspection and weight certificates shall be issued on 
the basis of the most representative

elevator operators who (i) exported 15,000 metric tons or more of grain 
during the preceding calendar year, or (ii) have exported 15,000 metric 
tons or more of grain during the current calendar year. Exporters and 
elevator operators who are granted a waiver by reason of this paragraph 
shall, as a condition of the waiver, keep such accounts, records, and 
memorandum to fully and correctly disclose all transactions concerning 
lots of all export grain shipments. In addition, the exporters or 
elevator operators shall notify the Service in writing of the intention 
to export grain under this waiver. In the case of lots waived under this 
provision, if such lots are required by contract to be inspected or 
weighed, or if the lots are represented by official inspection or weight 
certificates, then such certificates shall meet the requirements of 
section 5 of the Act.
    (2) Grain exported for seeding purposes. Official inspection and 
Class X weighing requirements do not apply to grain exported for seeding 
purposes, provided that (i) the grain is (A) sold or consigned for sale 
and invoiced as seed; and (B) identified as seed for seeding purposes on 
the Shipper's Export Declaration; and (ii) records pertaining to these 
shipments are made available, upon request by the Service, for review or 
copying purposes.
    (3) Grain shipped in bond. Official inspection and weighing 
requirements do not apply to grain that is shipped from a foreign 
country to a foreign country through the United States in bond in

    (4) Grain exported by rail or truck to Canada or Mexico. Inspection 
and weighing requirements do not apply to grain exported by rail or 
truck from the United States to Canada or Mexico.
    (5) Grain not sold by grade. Official inspection requirements may be 
waived by the Service on a shipment-by-shipment basis for export grain 
not sold, offered for sale, or consigned for sale by official grade if 
(i) the contract and any amendments clearly show that the buyer and 
seller mutually agree to ship the grain without official inspection and 
(ii) a copy of the contract and any amendments is furnished in advance 
of loading, along with a completed application on a form prescribed by 
the Service.
    (6) Service not available. Upon request, any required official 
inspection or Class X weighing of grain may be waived on a shipment-by-
shipment basis if (i) official personnel are not and will not be 
available within a 24-hour period to perform needed inspection or 
weighing services and (ii) both the buyer and seller of the grain are 
made aware that the grain has not been officially inspected or Class X 
weighed.
    (7) Emergency waiver. Upon request, the requirements for official 
inspection or Class X weighing may be waived whenever the Service 
determines (i) that an emergency exists that precludes official 
inspection or Class X weighing and (ii) that granting an emergency 
waiver will not impair the objectives of the Act. To qualify for an 
emergency waiver, the exporter or elevator operator shall make timely 
application and comply with all conditions which may be required by the 
Service.
    (8) High Quality Specialty Grain Shipped in Containers. Official 
inspection and weighing requirements do not apply to high quality 
specialty grain exported in containers. Records generated during the

[[Page 234]]

800.99, be made accessible by the applicant for the performance of the 
requested official service and related monitoring and supervision 
activities. For the purposes of this section, grain is not 
``accessible'' if it is offered for official services (i) in containers 
or carriers that are closed and cannot, with reasonable effort, be 
opened by or for official personnel; (ii) when any portion is located so 
as to prohibit the securing or a representative sample; or (iii) under 
conditions prescribed in the instructions as being hazardous to the 
health or safety of official personnel.
    (2) Working space. When official services are performed at an 
elevator, adequate and separate space must be provided by the applicant 
for the performance of the requested service and related monitoring and 
supervision activities. Space will be ``adequate'' if it meets the 
space, location, and safety requirements specified in the instructions.
    (3) Notice of changes. The operator of each facility at which 
official services are performed must notify the appropriate agency or 
field office promptly, in full detail, of changes in the grain handling 
and weighing facilities, equipment, or procedures at the elevator that 
could or would affect the proper performance of official services.

for official services must provide or arrange for suitable conditions in 
the (i) loading and unloading areas and the truck and railroad holding 
areas; (ii) gallery and other grain-conveying areas; (iii) elevator 
legs, distributor, and spout areas; (iv) pier or dock areas; (v) deck 
and stowage areas in the carrier; and (vi) equipment used in loading or 
unloading and handling the grain. Suitable conditions are those which 
will facilitate accurate inspection and weighing, maintain the quantity 
and the quality of the grain that is to be officially inspected or 
weighed, and not be hazardous to the health and safety of official 
personnel, as prescribed in the instructions.
    (5) Timely arrangements. Requests for official service shall be made 
in a timely manner; otherwise, official personnel may not be available 
to provide the requested service. For the purpose of this paragraph, 
``timely manner'' shall mean not later than 2 p.m., local time, of the 
preceding business day.
    (6) Observation of activities. Each applicant for official services 
must provide any interested person, or their agent, an opportunity to 
observe sampling, inspection, weighing, and loading or unloading of 
grain. Appropriate observation areas shall be mutually defined by the 
Service and facility operator. The areas shall be safe and shall afford 
a clear and unobstructed view of the performance of the activity, but 
shall not permit a close over-the-shoulder type of observation by the 
interested person.
    (7) Payment of bills. Each applicant, for services under the Act, 
must pay bills for the services according to Sec. Sec. 800.70 through 
800.73.
    (8) Written confirmations. When requested by the agency or field 
office, verbal requests for official services shall be confirmed in 
writing. Each written request shall be signed by the applicant, or the 
applicant's agent, and shall show or be accompanied by the following 
information: (i) The identification, quantity, and specific location of 
the grain; (ii) the name and mailing address of the applicant; (iii) the 
kind and scope of services desired; and (iv) any other information 
requested by the agency or field office.
    (9) Names and addresses of interested persons. When requested, each 
applicant for official services shall show on the application form the 
name and address of each known interested person.
    (10) Surrender of superseded certificates. When a request for 
official service results in a certificate being superseded, the 
superseded certificate must be promptly surrendered.
    (11) Recordkeeping and access. Each applicant for official services 
must comply with applicable recordkeeping and access-to-facility 
provisions in Sec. Sec. 800.25 and 800.26.
    (12) Monitoring equipment. Owners and operators of elevators shall, 
upon a finding of need by the Administrator, provide equipment necesary 
for the monitoring by official personnel of grain loading, unloading, 
handling, sampling, weighing, inspection, and related activities. The 
finding of need

[[Page 235]]

Act.

If a facility has, or plans to have, an automated data processing system 
which is used in conjunction with any portion of the scale system, grain 
handling system, or the preparing or printing of official weight 
certificates, the facility shall make available to the Service 
sufficient documentation to ensure that the system cannot be used 
deceptively or otherwise provide inaccurate information. The Service or 
approved scale testing and certification organization shall conduct an 
onsite review to evaluate the performance and accuracy of each scale 
that will be used for weighing grain under the Act, and the performance 
of the grain loading, unloading, and related grain handling equipment 
and systems.
    (3) Duties and responsibilities of weighing facilities requesting 
official services. (i) Providing official services. Upon request, each 
weighing facility shall permit official weighing services to be 
performed promptly.
    (ii) Supervision. Each weighing facility shall supervise its 
employees and shall take action necessary to assure that employees are 
performing their duties according to the Act, regulations, and 
instructions and are not performing prohibited functions or are not 
involved in any action prohibited by the Act, regulations, and 
instructions.
    (iii) Facilities and equipment. (A) General. Each weighing facility 
shall obtain and maintain facilities and equipment which the Service 
determines are needed for weighing services performed at the facility.

Sec. 800.48  Dismissal of request for official services.

    (a) Conditions for dismissal--(1) General. An agency or the Service 
shall dismiss requests for official services when (i) Sec. 800.76 
prohibits the requested service; (ii) performing the requested service 
is not practicable; (iii) the agency or the Service lacks authority 
under the Act or regulations; or (iv) sufficient information is not 
available to make an accurate determination.
    (2) Original services. A request for original services shall be 
dismissed if a reinspection, review of weighing, appeal inspection, or 
Board appeal inspection has been performed on the same lot at the same 
specified service point within 5 business days.
    (3) Reinspection, appeal inspection, or Board appeal inspection 
services. A request for a reinspection, appeal inspection, or Board 
appeal inspection service shall be dismissed when: (i) The kind and 
scope are different from the kind and scope of the last inspection 
service; (ii) the condition of the grain has undergone a material 
change; (iii) the request specifies a representative file sample and a 
representative file sample is not available, (iv) the applicant requests 
that a new sample be obtained and a new sample cannot be obtained; or 
(v) the service cannot be performed within 5 business days of the date 
of the last inspection date.
    (4) Review of weighing services. A request for review of weighing 
services shall be dismissed when the request (i) is filed before the 
weighing results have been released, or (ii) is filed more than 90 
calendar days after the date of the original service.
    (b) Procedure for dismissal. When an agency or the Service proposes 
to dismiss a request for official services, the applicant shall be 
notified of the proposed action. The applicant will then be afforded 
reasonable time to take corrective action or to demonstrate there is no 
basis for the dismissal. If the agency or the Service determines that 
corrective action has not been adequate, the applicant will be notified 
again of the decision to dismiss the request for service, and any 
results of official services shall not be released.

(Secs. 8, 9, 10, 13 and 18, Pub. L. 94-582, 90 Stat. 2870, 2875, 2877,

Sec. 800.50  Refusal of official services and civil penalties.

    (a) Grounds for refusal. Any or all services available to an 
applicant under the Act may be refused, either temporarily or 
indefinitely, by the Service for causes prescribed in section 10(a) of 
the Act. Such refusal by the Service may be restricted to the particular 
facility or applicant (if not a facility) found in violation or to a 
particular type of service, as the facts may warrant. Such action may be 
in addition to, or in lieu of, criminal penalties or other remedial 
action authorized by the Act.
    (b) Provision and procedure for summary refusal. The Service may, 
without first affording the applicant (hereafter in this section 
``respondent'') a hearing, refuse to provide official inspection and 
Class X or Y weighing services pending final determination of the 
proceeding whenever the Service has reason to believe there is cause, as 
prescribed in section 10 of the Act, for refusing such official services 
and considers such action to be in the best interest of the official 
services system under the Act: Provided that within 7 days after refusal 
of such service, the Service shall afford the respondent an opportunity 
for a hearing as provided under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. 
Pending final determination, the Service may terminate the temporary 
refusal if alternative managerial, staffing, financial, or operational 
arrangements satisfactory to the Service can be and are made by the 
respondent.
    (c) Procedure for other than summary refusal. Except as provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section, before the Service refuses to provide 
official services the respondent shall be (1) notified of the services 
that are to be refused, the locations at which and the time period for 
which service will be refused, and the reasons for the refusal; and (2) 
afforded an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the provisions 
of the Rules of Practice Governing Formal Adjudicatory Proceedings 
Instituted by the Secretary Under Various Statutes (7 CFR 1.130 et 
seq.). At the discretion of the Service, prior to initiation of formal 
adjudicatory proceedings, the respondent may be given an opportunity to 
express his or her views on the action proposed by the Service in an 
informal conference before the Administrator of the Service. If, as a 
result of such an informal conference, the Service and the respondent 
enter into a consent agreement, no formal adjudicatory proceedings shall 
be initiated.
    (d) Assessment of civil penalties. Any person who has knowingly 
committed any violation of section 13 of the Act or has been convicted 
of any violation of other Federal law with respect to the handling, 
weighing, or official inspection of grain may be assessed a civil 
penalty not to exceed $75,000 for each such violation as the 
Administrator determines is appropriate to effect compliance with the 
Act. Such action may be in addition to, or in lieu of, criminal 
penalties under section 14 of the Act, or in addition to, or in lieu of, 
the refusal of official services authorized by the Act.
    (e) Provisions for civil penalty hearings. Before a civil penalty is 
assessed against any person, such person shall be afforded an 
opportunity for a hearing as provided under paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section.
    (f) Collection of civil penalties. Upon failure to pay the civil 
penalty, the Service may request the Attorney General to file civil 
action to collect the penalty in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.

                              Descriptions


<R05>
Sec. 800.55  Descriptions by grade.

    (a) General. In any sale, offer for sale, or consignment for sale, 
which involves the shipment of grain in interstate or foreign commerce, 
the description of grain, as being of a grade in any advertising, price 
quotation, other negotiation of sale, contract of sale, invoice, bill of 
lading, other document, or description on bags or other containers of 
the grain, is prohibited if such description is other than by an 
official grade designation, with or without additional information as to 
specified factors. An official grade designation contains any of the 
following: The term ``U.S.,'' the numerals 1 through 5, the term 
``Sample grade,'' or the name of a subclass or a special grade of grain 
specified in the Official United States Standards for Grain.
    (b) Proprietary brand names or trademarks. A description of grain by 
a proprietary brand name or a trademark that does not resemble an 
official grade designation will not be considered to be a description by 
grade; but a description by a proprietary brand name or trademark that 
contains singly or in combination any of the terms referenced in 
paragraph (a) of this section shall be considered to resemble an 
official grade designation.
    (c) Use of one or more factor designations. In interstate commerce, 
a description of grain by the use of one or more grade factor 
designations which appear in the Official United States Standards for 
Grain or by other criteria will not be considered to be a description by 
grade.
    (d) False or misleading descriptions. In any sale, offer for sale, 
or consignment for sale of any grain which involves the shipment of 
grain from the United States to any place outside thereof, knowingly 
using a false or misleading description of grain by official grade 
designation, or other description is prohibited.

[50 FR 9982, Mar. 13, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 800.56  Requirements on descriptions.

    Section 13 of the Act contains certain prohibitions with respect to 
the use of official grade designations, official marks, and other 
representations with respect to grain.
    (a) The use of an official grade designation, with or without factor 
information, or of official criteria information, or of the term 
``official grain standards,'' shall not, without additional information, 
be considered to be a representation that the grain was officially 
inspected.
    (b) The use of any symbol or term listed as an official mark, at 
Sec. 800.0(b)(68), with respect to grain shall be considered to be a 
representation of official service under the Act: Provided however, that 
the use of the official marks ``official certificate;'' ``officially 
inspected;'' ``official inspection;'' ``officially weighed;'' ``official 
weight;'' and ``official weighing'' shall not be considered to be a 
representation of official service under the Act if it is clearly shown 
that the activity occurred under the U.S. Warehouse Act (7 U.S.C. 241 et 
seq.): Provided further, that the use of the official mark ``officially 
tested'' with respect to grain inspection and weighing equipment shall 
not be considered to be a representation of testing under the Act if it 
is clearly shown that the equipment was tested under a State statute.

                        Grain Handling Practices


<R05>
Sec. 800.60  Deceptive actions and practices.

    In the absence of prior adequate notice to appropriate official 
personnel, any action or practice, including the loading, weighing, 
handling, or sampling of grain that knowingly causes or is an attempt to 
cause the issuance by official personnel of a false or incorrect 
official certificate or other official form, is deemed to be deceptive 
and, as such, is a violation of section 13(a)(3) of the Act. For the 
purposes of this paragraph, adequate notice is written or

[[Page 239]]

oral notice given to an agency or the Service, as applicable, before 
official personnel begin to perform official inspection or weighing 
services. If oral notice is given, it must be confirmed in writing 
within 2 business days. To be adequate, the notice must explain the 
nature and extent of the action or practice in question and must 
identify the grain, stowage container, equipment, facility, and the 
official personnel actually or potentially involved.

<R05>
Sec. 800.61  Prohibited grain handling practices.

    (a) Definitions. For the purpose of this section, dockage and 
foreign material in grain shall be:
    (1) Defined for export elevators at export port locations as set 
forth in 7 CFR part 810 and as dust removed from grain and collected in 
a bin/container and as dust settling on floors, equipment, and other 
areas, commonly referred to as dust sweepings; and
    (2) Defined for other than export elevators as set forth in 7 CFR 
part 810.
    (b) Prohibited practices. Except as permitted in paragraphs (c) and 
(d) of this section, no person shall:
    (1) Recombine or add dockage or foreign material to any grain, or
    (2) Blend different kinds of grain except when such blending will 
result in grain being designated as Mixed grain in accordance with 
subpart E of the Official United States Standards for Grain.
    (3) Add water to grain for purposes other than milling, malting, or 
similar processing operations.
    (c) Exemption. (1) The Administrator may grant exemptions from 
paragraph (b) of this section for grain shipments sent directly to a 
domestic end-user or processor. Requests for exemptions shall be 
submitted by grain handlers to the Service through the domestic end-
users or processors or their representatives.
    (2) Grain sold under an exemption shall be consumed or processed 
into a product(s) by the purchaser and not resold into the grain market.
    (3) Products or byproducts from grain sold under an exemption shall 
not be blended with or added to grain in commercial channels, except for 
vegetable oil which may be used as a dust suppressant in accordance with 
(d)(4) of this section.
    (d) Exceptions. Paragraph (b) shall not be construed as prohibiting 
the following grain handling practices. Compliance with paragraphs 
(d)(1) through (d)(6) of this section does not excuse compliance with 
applicable Federal, State, and local laws.
    (1) Blending. Grain of the same kind, as defined by the Official 
United States Standards for Grain, may be blended to adjust quality. 
Broken corn or broken kernels may be recombined or added to whole grain 
of the same kind provided that no foreign material or dockage has been 
added to the broken corn or broken kernels.
    (2) Insect and fungi control. Grain may be treated to control 
insects and fungi. Elevators, other grain handlers, and their agents are 
responsible for the proper use and applications of insecticides and 
fungicides. Sections 800.88 and 800.96 include additional requirements 
for grain that is officially inspected and weighed.
    (3) Marketing dockage and foreign material. Dockage and foreign 
material may be marketed separately.
    (4) Dust suppressants. Grain may be treated with an additive, other 
than water, to suppress dust during handling. Elevators, other grain 
handlers, and their agents are responsible for the proper use and 
application of dust suppressants. Sections 800.88 and 800.96 include 
additional requirements for grain that is officially inspected and 
weighed.
    (5) Identification. Confetti or similar material may be added to 
grain for identification purposes. Elevators, other grain handlers, and 
their agents are responsible for the proper use and application of such 
materials. Sections 800.88 and 800.96 include additional requirements 
for grain that is officially inspected or weighed.
    (6) Export loading facilities. Between May 1, 1987, and December 31, 
1987, export elevators at export port locations

[[Page 240]]

may recombine dockage and foreign material, but not dust, with grain 
provided such recombination occurs during the loading of a vessel with 
the intended purpose of ensuring uniformity of dockage and foreign 
material in the cargo.

                                  Fees


<R05>
Sec. 800.70  Fees for official services performed by agencies.

    (a) Assessment and use of fees. (1) Fees assessed by an agency for 
official inspection and Class X or Class Y weighing services or testing 
of inspection equipment shall be reasonable and nondiscriminatory.
    (2) In the case of a State or local governmental agency, fees shall 
not be used for any purpose other than to finance the cost of the 
official inspection and Class X or Class Y weighing service and 
inspection equipment testing service performed by the agency or the cost 
of other closely related programs administered by the agency.
    (b) Approval required--(1) Restriction. Only fees that meet the 
requirements stated in this section and are approved by the Service as 
reasonable and nondiscriminatory may be charged by an agency.
    (2) Exceptions. For good cause shown by an agency, the Administrator 
may grant case-by-case exceptions to the requirements in this section, 
provided that a determination is made that the agency fees would be 
reasonable and nondiscriminatory.
    (c) Reasonable fees. In determining if an agency's fees are 
reasonable, the Service will consider whether the fees: (1) Cover the 
estimated total cost to the agency of (i) official inspection services, 
(ii) Class X or Class Y weighing services, (iii) inspection equipment 
testing services, and (iv) related supervision and monitoring activities 
performed by the agency; (2) Are reasonably consistent with fees 
assessed by adjacent agencies for similar services; (3) Are assessed on 
the basis of the average cost of performing the same or similar services 
at all locations served by the agency; and (4) Are supported by 
sufficient information which shows how the fees were developed.
    (d) Nondiscriminatory fees. In determining if fees are 
nondiscriminatory, the Service will consider whether the fees are 
collected from all applicants for official service in accordance with 
the approved fee schedule. Charges for time and travel incurred in 
providing service at a location away from a specified service point 
shall be assessed in accordance with the approved fee schedule.
    (e) Schedule of fees to be established. (1) Each agency shall 
establish a schedule of fees for official services which the agency is 
delegated or designated the authority to perform. The schedule shall be 
in a standard format in accordance with the instructions. Such schedules 
may include fees for nonofficial services provided by the agency, but 
they shall be clearly identified and will not be subject to approval by 
the Service.
    (2) The schedule shall be published and made available by the agency 
to all users of its services.
    (f) Request for approval of fees--(1) Time requirement. A request 
for approval of a new or revised fee shall be submitted to the Service 
not less than 60 days in advance of the proposed effective date for the 
fee. Failure to submit a request within the prescribed time period may 
be considered grounds for postponment or denial of the request.
    (2) Contents of request. Each request shall show (i) the present 
fee, if any, and the proposed fee, together with data showing in detail 
how the fee was developed, and (ii) the proposed effective date.
    (g) Review of request--(1) Approval action. If upon review the 
Service finds that the request and supporting data justify the new or 
revised fee, the request will be marked ``approved'' and returned to the 
agency.
    (2) Denial action. If the Service finds that the request and 
supporting data do not justify the new or revised fee, approval of the 
request will be withheld pending receipt of any additional supporting 
data which the agency has to offer. If the data are not submitted within 
a reasonable period, the request

[[Page 241]]

shall be denied. In the case of a denial of a request, the agency shall 
be notified of the reason for denial.

    (d) Conflicts of interest. No official personnel shall perform or 
participate in performing an official inspection service on grain or on 
a carrier or container in which they have a direct or indirect financial 
interest.

Sec. 800.81  Sample requirements; general.

    (a) Samples for official sample-lot inspection service--(1) Original 
official sample-lot inspection service. For original sample-lot 
inspection purposes, an official sample shall be obtained by official 
personnel; representative of the grain in the lot; and protected from 
manipulation, substitution, and improper or careless handling.
    (2) Official sample-lot reinspection and appeal inspection service. 
For an official sample-lot reinspection service or an official appeal 
sample-lot inspection service, the sample(s) on which the reinspection 
or appeal is determined shall (i) be obtained by official personnel and 
(ii) otherwise meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section. If the reinspection or appeal inspection is determined on the 
basis of official file sample(s), the samples shall meet the 
requirements of Sec. 800.82(d).
    (3) New sample. Upon request and if practicable, a new sample shall 
be obtained and examined as a part of a reinspection or appeal 
inspection. The provision for a new sample shall not apply if obtaining 
the new sample involves a change in method of sampling.
    (b) Representative sample. A sample shall not be considered 
representative unless it (1) has been obtained by official personnel, 
(2) is of the size prescribed in the instructions, and (3) has been 
obtained, handled, and submitted in accordance with the instructions. A 
sample which fails to meet the requirements of this paragraph may, upon 
request of the applicant, be inspected as a submitted sample.
    (c) Protecting samples. Official personnel shall protect official 
samples, warehouseman's samples, and submitted samples from 
manipulation, substitution, or improper and careless handling which may 
deprive the samples of their representativeness or which may change the 
physical or chemical properties of the grain, as appropriate, from the 
time of sampling or receipt until the inspection services are completed 
and the file samples have been discarded.

[[Page 248]]

    (d) Restriction on sampling. Official personnel shall not perform an 
original inspection or a reinspection service on an official sample or a 
warehouseman's sample unless the grain from which the sample was 
obtained was located within the area of responsibility assigned to the 
agency or field office at the time of sampling, except as provided for 
in Sec. 800.117, or on a case-by-case basis as determined by the 
Administrator.
    (e) Disposition of samples--(1) Excess grain. Any grain in excess of 
the quantity specified in the instructions for the requested service, 
the file samples, and samples requested by interested persons shall be 
returned to the lot from which the grain was obtained or to the owner of 
the lot or the owner's order.
    (2) Inspection samples. Inspection samples, after they have served 
their intended purpose, shall be disposed of as follows:
    (i) Samples which contain toxic substances or materials shall be 
kept out of food and feed channels, and
    (ii) Official personnel shall dispose of samples obtained or 
submitted to them according to procedures established by the Service. 
Complete and accurate records of disposition shall be maintained.

Sec. 800.82  Sampling provisions by level of service.

    (a) Original inspection service--(1) Official sample-lot inspection 
service. Each original inspection service shall be performed on the 
basis of one or more official samples obtained by official personnel 
from grain in the lot and forwarded to the appropriate agency or field 
office.
    (2) Warehouseman's sample-lot inspection. Each original 
warehouseman's sample-lot inspection service shall be performed on the 
basis of samples obtained by a licensed warehouseman and sent to the 
appropriate agency or field office in whose circuit the warehouse is 
located.
    (3) Submitted sample service. Each original submitted sample 
inspection service shall be performed on the basis of the sample as 
submitted.
    (b) Reinspection, and appeal inspection services--(1) Official 
sample-lot inspection service. Each of these inspection services shall 
be performed on the basis of official samples as available, including 
file samples, at the time the service is requested. In performing these 
services, a sample obtained with an approved diverter-type mechanical 
sampler or with a pelican sampler generally shall be used with respect 
to quality factors and official criteria, and a sample obtained with a 
probe at the time of the reinspection or appeal, generally, shall be 
used with respect to heating, musty, sour, insect infestation, and other 
condition and odor factors. In instances where original inspection 
results are based on samples obtained by probe, the decision as to 
whether file samples or new samples obtained by probe are to be used 
shall be made by the official personnel performing the service.
    (2) Warehouseman's sample-lot inspection service. Each reinspection 
service and appeal inspection service on a warehouseman's sample shall 
be performed on an analysis of the official file sample.
    (3) Submitted sample service. Each reinspection service and appeal 
inspection service on a submitted sample shall be performed on an 
analysis of the official file sample.
    (c) Board appeal inspection services. Board appeal inspection 
services shall be performed on an analysis of the official file sample.
    (d) Use of file samples--(1) Requirements for use. A file sample 
that is retained by official personnel in accordance with the procedures 
prescribed in the instructions may be considered representative for a 
reinspection service, appeal inspection service, and a Board appeal 
inspection service if (i) the file sample has remained at all times in 
the custody and control of the official personnel that performed the 
inspection service in question; and (ii) the official personnel who 
performed the original inspection service and those who are to perform 
the reinspection, the appeal inspection, or the Board appeal inspection 
service determine that the samples were representative at the time

[[Page 249]]

the original inspection service was performed and that the quality or 
condition of the grain in the samples has not changed.
    (2) Certificate statement. When the results of a reinspection, 
appeal inspection, or Board appeal inspection service are based on an 
official file sample, the certificate for the reinspection service, the 
appeal inspection service, and the Board appeal inspection service shall 
show a statement, as specified in the instructions, indicating that the 
results are based on the official file sample.

Sec. 800.83  Sampling provisions by kind of movement.

    (a) Export cargo movements--(1) Bulk grain. Except as may be 
approved by the Administrator on a shipment-by-shipment basis in an 
emergency, each inspection for official grade, official factor, or 
official criteria on an export cargo shipment of bulk grain shall be 
performed on official samples obtained from the grain (i) as the grain 
is being loaded aboard the final carrier; (ii) after the final elevation 
of the grain prior to loading and as near to the final loading spout as 
is physically practicable (except as approved by the Administrator when 
representative samples can be obtained before the grain reaches the 
final loading spout); and (iii) by means of a diverter-type mechanical 
sampler approved by the Service and operated in accordance with 
instructions. If an approved diverter-type mechanical sampler is not 
properly installed at an elevator or facility as required, each 
certificate issued at that elevator or facility for an export cargo 
shipment of bulk grain shall show a statement indicating the type of 
approved sampling method used, as prescribed in the instructions.
    (2) Sacked grain. Each inspection for official grade, official 
factor, or official criteria on an export cargo shipment of sacked grain 
shall be performed on official samples obtained from the grain by any 
sampling method approved by the Service and operated in accordance with 
instructions.
    (b) Other movements. Each inspection for official grade, official 
factor, or official criteria on a domestic cargo movement (``In,'' 
``Out,'' or en route barge movement), a movement in a land carrier (any 
movement in a railcar, truck trailer, truck/trailer combination, or 
container), or a ``LOCAL'' movement of bulk or sacked grain shall be 
performed on official samples obtained from the grain by any sampling 
method approved by the Service and operated in accordance with the 
instructions.

<R05>
Sec. 800.84  Inspection of grain in land carriers, containers, and barges
in single lots.

    (a) General. The reinspection of bulk or sacked grain loaded or 
unloaded from any carrier or container, except shiplot grain, shall be 
conducted in accordance with the provisions in this section and 
procedures prescribed in the instructions.
    (b) Single and multiple grade procedure--(1) Single grade. When 
grain in a carrier or container is offered for inspection as one lot and 
the grain is found to be uniform in condition, the grain shall be 
sampled, inspected, graded, and certificated as one lot. For the purpose 
of this paragraph, condition only includes the factors heating, musty, 
or sour.
    (2) Multiple grade. When grain in a carrier or container is offered 
for inspection as one lot and the grain is found to be not uniform in 
condition because portions of the grain are heating, musty, or sour, the 
grain in each portion will be sampled, inspected, and graded separately; 
but the results shall be shown on one certificate. The certificate shall 
show the approximate quantity or weight of each portion, the location of 
each portion in the carrier or container, and the grade of the grain in 
each portion.
    (3) Infested. If any portion of grain in a lot is found to be 
infested, according to applicable provisions of the Official U.S. 
Standards for Grain, the entire lot shall be considered infested. When 
grain in railcars or trucks with permanently enclosed tops is considered 
infested, the applicant for inspection shall be promptly notified and 
given

[[Page 250]]

the option of (i) receiving a grade certificate with a special grade 
designation indicating that the entire lot is infested or (ii) 
fumigating the grain in the lot in accordance with instructions and 
receiving a grade certificate without the special grade designation.
    (c) One certificate per carrier: exceptions. Except as provided in 
this paragraph, one official certificate shall be issued for the 
inspection of the grain in each truck, trailer, truck/trailer(s) 
combination, railcar, barge, or similarly sized carrier. The 
requirements of this paragraph are not applicable:
    (1) When grain is inspected in a combined lot under Sec. 800.85;
    (2) When grain is inspected under paragraph (d) of this section; or
    (3) When certification is at the option of the applicant in 
accordance with instructions.
    (d) Bulkhead lots. If grain in a carrier is offered for official 
inspection as two or more lots and the lots are separated by bulkheads 
or other partitions, the grain in each lot shall be sampled, inspected, 
and graded separately in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section. An official certificate shall be issued for each lot inspected. 
Each certificate shall show the term ``Bulkhead Lot,'' the approximate 
quantity or weight of the grain in the lot, the location of the lot in 
the carrier, and the grade of the grain in the lot.
    (e) Bottom not sampled. If bulk grain offered for official 
inspection is at rest in a carrier or container and is fully accessible 
for sampling in an approved manner, except that the bottom of the 
carrier or container cannot be reached with each probe, the grain shall 
be sampled as thoroughly as possible with an approved probe. The grain 
in the resulting samples shall be inspected, graded, and certificated, 
except that each certificate shall show a statement, as specified in the 
instructions, indicating the depth probed. Any inspection which is based 
on a sample that does not represent the entire carrier or container does 
not meet the mandatory inspection requirements of section 5(a)(1) of the 
Act.
    (f) Partial inspection--heavily loaded--(1) General. When an ``In'' 
movement of bulk grain is offered for inspection at rest in a carrier or 
container and is loaded in such a manner that it is possible to secure 
only door-probe or shallow-probe samples, the container shall be 
considered to be ``heavily loaded,'' and the request for inspection 
either shall be dismissed or a partial inspection shall be made. If the 
request is for the inspection of an ``Out'' movement of grain, the 
request shall be dismissed on the grounds that the grain is not 
accessible for a correct ``Out'' inspection.
    (2) Certification procedure. If a partial inspection is made, the 
grain will be sampled as thoroughly as possible with an approved probe 
and inspected, graded, and a ``partial inspection--heavily loaded'' 
certificate issued. The certificate shall show the words ``Partial 
inspection--heavily loaded'' in the space provided for remarks. The type 
of samples that were obtained shall be described in terms of ``door 
probe'' or ``shallow probe.''
    (3) Reinspection and appeal inspection procedure. A request for a 
reinspection or an appeal inspection service on grain in a carrier or 
container that is certificated as ``partial inspection--heavily loaded'' 
shall be dismissed in accordance with Sec. 800.48(a)(4).
    (4) Restriction. No ``partial inspection--heavily loaded'' 
certificate shall be issued for sacked grain or any inspection other 
than the inspections described in paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this 
section and Sec. 800.85(h)(2).
    (g) Part lots--(1) General. If a portion of the grain in a carrier 
or container is removed, the grain that is removed and the grain 
remaining shall be considered separate lots. When an official inspection 
service is requested on either portion, the grain shall be sampled, 
inspected, graded, and a ``part-lot'' inspection certificate issued.
    (2) Grain remaining in carrier or container. The certificate for 
grain remaining in a carrier or container shall show (i) the following 
completed statement: ``Partly unloaded; results based on portion 
remaining in (show carrier or container identification),'' (ii) the term 
``Part lot'' following the quantity information, (iii) the 
identification of the carrier or container, and (iv) the estimated 
amount and location of the part lot.

[[Page 251]]

    (3) Grain unloaded from carrier or container. If grain is sampled by 
official personnel during unloading, the certificate for the grain that 
is unloaded shall show (i) the completed statement: ``Part lot; results 
based on portion removed from (show carrier identification)'' and (ii) 
the term ``Part lot'' following the quantity information. If the grain 
is not sampled by official personnel during unloading, the certificate 
may, upon request of the applicant, show a completed statement such as 
``Applicant states grain is ex-car '' or ``Applicant states grain is ex-
barge ,'' but the certificate shall not otherwise show a carrier or 
container identification or the term ``Part lot.''
    (h) Identification for compartmented cars. The identification for 
compartments in a compartmented railcar shall, in the absence of readily 
visible markings, be stated in terms of the location of the grain in a 
compartment, with the first compartment at the brake end of the car 
being identified as B-1, and the remaining compartments being numbered 
consecutively towards the other end of the car.

Sec. 800.85  Inspection of grain in combined lots.

    (a) General. The official inspection for grade of bulk or sacked 
grain loaded aboard, or being loaded aboard, or discharged from two or 
more carriers or containers (including barges designed for loading 
aboard a ship) as a combined lot shall be performed according to the 
provisions of this section and procedures prescribed in the 
instructions.
    (b) Application procedure--(1) For inspection during loading, 
unloading, or at rest. Applications for official inspection of grain as 
a combined lot shall (i) be filed in accordance with Sec. 800.116; (ii) 
show the estimated quantity of grain that is to be certificated as one 
lot; (iii) show the contract grade if applicable; and (iv) identify each 
carrier into which grain is being loaded or from which grain is being 
unloaded.
    (2) Recertification. An application for recertification as a 
combined lot of grain that has been officially inspected and 
certificated as two or more single lots shall (i) be filed not later 
than 2 business days after the latest inspection date of the single lots 
and (ii) show information specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (c) Inspection procedure; general--land carriers and barges--(1) 
Inspection during loading, or unloading, or at rest. Grain in two or 
more land carriers and barges that are to be officially inspected as a 
combined lot shall be sampled in a reasonably continuous operation. 
Representative samples shall be obtained from the grain in each 
individual carrier and inspected in accordance with procedures as 
prescribed in the instructions.
    (2) Recertification. Grain that has been officially inspected and 
certificated as two or more single lots may be recertificated as a 
combined lot if (i) the grain in each lot was sampled in a reasonably 
continuous operation; (ii) the original inspection certificates issued 
for the single lots have been surrendered to official personnel; (iii) 
representative file samples of the single lots are available; (iv) the 
grain in the single lots is of one grade and quality; (v) official 
personnel who performed the inspection service for the single lots and 
those who are to recertificate the grain as a combined lot determine 
that the samples used as a basis for the inspection of the grain in the 
single lots were representative at the time of sampling and have not 
changed in quality or condition; and (vi) the quality or condition of 
the grain meets uniformity requirements established by the Service for 
official inspection of grain in combined lots.
    (d) Weighted or mathematical average. Official factor and official 
criteria information shown on a certificate for grain in a combined lot 
shall, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (e) through (g) of this 
section, be based on the weighted or mathematical averages of the 
analysis of the sublots in the lot and shall be determined in accordance 
with the instructions.
    (e) Infested grain. If the grain in a combined lot is offered for 
official inspection as it is being loaded aboard a carrier and the 
grain, or a portion of the grain, in a lot is found to be infested, 
according to applicable provisions of the Official U.S. Standards for

[[Page 252]]

Grain, the applicant shall be notified and may exercise options 
specified in the instructions. When grain in railcars or trucks with 
permanently enclosed tops is considered infested, the applicant shall be 
given the option of (1) receiving a grade certificate with a special 
grade designation indicating that the entire lot is infested or (2) 
fumigating the grain in the lot in accordance with instructions and 
receiving a grade certificate without the special grade designation.
    (f) Grain uniform in quality. Samples obtained from grain officially 
inspected as a combined lot shall be examined for uniformity of quality. 
If the grain in the samples is found to be uniform in quality and the 
grain is loaded aboard or is unloaded from the carriers in a reasonably 
continuous operation, the grain in the combined lot shall be officially 
inspected and certificated as one lot. The requirements of this 
paragraph (f) and paragraph (c) of this section with respect to 
reasonably continuous loading or unloading do not apply to grain which 
is at rest in carriers when the grain is offered for inspection.
    (g) Grain not uniform in quality. When grain officially inspected as 
a combined lot is found to be not uniform in quality or if the grain is 
not loaded or unloaded in a reasonably continuous operation, the grain 
in each portion, and any grain which is loaded or unloaded at different 
times, shall be officially sampled, inspected, graded, and certificated 
as single lots.
    (h) Special certification procedures--(1) Grain not uniform in 
quality. When grain in a combined lot is found to be not uniform in 
quality under paragraph (g) of this section, the official inspection 
certificate for each portion of different quality shall show (i) the 
grade, identification, and approximate quantity of the grain and (ii) 
other information required by the instructions.
    (2) Partial inspection. When an inbound movement of bulk grain is 
offered for official inspection at rest as a combined lot and all 
carriers are not fully accessible for sampling, the request for official 
inspection either shall be dismissed or a combined lot inspection shall 
be made on those carriers that are accessible. Those lots that are not 
accessible shall be handled in accordance with Sec. 800.84. If the 
request is for an official inspection service on an outbound movement of 
grain at rest in a combined lot, the request shall be dismissed on the 
ground that the grain is not accessible for a correct ``Out'' 
inspection.
    (3) Official mark. If grain in a combined lot is inspected for grade 
as it is being loaded aboard two or more carriers, upon request of the 
applicant, the following mark shall be shown on the inspection 
certificate: ``Loaded under continuous official inspection'' or ``Loaded 
under continuous official inspection and weighing.''
    (4) Combined-lot certification; general. Each official certificate 
for a combined-lot inspection service shall show the identification for 
the ``combined lot'' or, at the request of the applicant, the 
identification of each carrier in the combined lot. If the 
identification of each carrier is not shown, the statement ``Carrier 
identification available on official inspection log'' shall be shown on 
the inspection certificate in the space provided for remarks. The 
identification and any seal information for the carriers may be shown on 
the reverse side of the inspection certificate, provided the statement 
``See reverse side'' is shown on the face of the certificate in the 
space provided for remarks.
    (5) Recertification. If a request for a combined-lot inspection 
service is filed after the grain has been officially inspected and 
certificated as single lots, the combined-lot inspection certificate 
shall show (i) the date of inspection of the grain in the combined lot 
(if the single lots were inspected on different dates, the latest of the 
dates shall be shown); (ii) a serial number other than the serial 
numbers of the official inspection certificates that are to be 
superseded; (iii) the location of the grain, if at rest, or the name of 
the elevator from which or into which the grain in the combined lot was 
loaded or unloaded; (iv) a statement showing the approximate quantity of 
grain in the combined lot; (v) a completed statement showing the 
identification of any superseded certificates; and (vi) if at the time 
of issuing the combined-lot inspection certificate the superseded

[[Page 253]]

certificates are not in the custody of the official personnel, a 
statement indicating that the superseded certificates have not been 
surrendered shall be clearly shown in the space provided for remarks. If 
the superseded certificates are in the custody of official personnel, 
the superseded certificates shall be clearly marked ``Void.''
    (i) Further combining. After a combined-lot inspection certificate 
has been issued, there shall be no further combining and no dividing of 
the certificate.
    (j) Limitation. No combined-lot inspection certificate shall be 
issued (1) for any official inspection service other than as described 
in this section or (2) which shows a quantity of grain in excess of the 
quantity in the single lots.

Sec. 800.86  Inspection of shiplot, unit train, and lash barge grain in 
single lots.

    (a) General. Official inspection for grade of bulk or sacked grain 
aboard, or being loaded aboard, or being unloaded from a ship, unit 
train, or lash barges as a single lot shall be performed according to 
the provisions of this section and procedures prescribed in the 
instructions.
    (b) Application procedure. Applications for the official inspection 
of shiplot, unit train, and lash barges as a single lot shall:
    (1) Be filed in advance of loading or unloading;
    (2) Show the estimated quantity of grain to be certificated;
    (3) Show the contract grade and official criteria if applicable; and
    (4) Identify the carrier and stowage area into which the grain is 
being loaded, or from which the grain is being unloaded, or in which the 
grain is at rest.
    (c) Inspection procedures--(1) General information. Shiplot, unit 
train, and lash barge grain officially inspected as a single lot shall 
be sampled in a reasonably continuous operation. Representative samples 
shall be obtained from the grain offered for inspection and inspected 
and graded in accordance with a statistical acceptance sampling and 
inspection plan according to the provisions of this section and 
procedures prescribed in the instructions.
    (2) Tolerances. The probability of accepting or rejecting portions 
of the lot during loading or unloading is dependent on inspection 
results obtained from preceding portions and the applied breakpoints and 
procedures. Breakpoints shall be periodically reviewed and revised based 
on new estimates of inspection variability. Tables 1 through 24 list the 
breakpoints for all grains.

    (3) Grain accepted by the inspection plan. Grain which is offered 
for inspection as part of a single lot and accepted by a statistical 
acceptance sampling and inspection plan according to the provisions of 
this section and procedures prescribed in the instructions shall be 
certificated as a single lot provided it was sampled in a reasonably 
continuous operation. Official factor and official criteria information 
shown on the certificate shall be based on the weighted or mathematical 
averages of the analysis of sublots.
    (4) Grain rejected by the inspection plan. When grain which is 
offered for inspection as part of a single lot is rejected by the plan 
or is not sampled in a reasonably continuous operation, the grain in 
each portion shall be certificated separately. If any portion of grain 
is not accepted by the plan and designated a material portion, the 
applicant shall be promptly notified and have the option of:
    (i) Removing the material portion from the carrier; or
    (ii) Requesting the material portion be separately certificated; or
    (iii) Requesting either a reinspection or an appeal inspection of 
the material portion; or
    (iv) Requesting a reinspection service and/or an appeal inspection 
service on the entire lot.
    (5) Reinspection service and appeal inspection service. A 
reinspection or an appeal inspection may be requested on a material 
portion. A Board appeal inspection may also be requested on a material 
portion after the reinspection or appeal inspection. A reinspection, an 
appeal inspection, and a Board appeal inspection may be requested on the 
total sublots in the lot.
    (i) Material portions. A material portion designated by the plan may 
be reinspected or appeal inspected once in the field, but not both, and 
once at the Board of Appeals and Review. The reinspection or appeal 
inspection result shall, unless a material error is found, be averaged 
with the original inspection determination. The Board appeal inspection 
result shall, unless a material error is found, be averaged with the 
previous inspection result. The inspection plan tolerances shall be 
reapplied to the material portion grain to determine acceptance or 
rejection. If a material error is found, the reinspection or appeal 
inspection result shall replace the original inspection result or the 
Board appeal result shall replace the previous inspection result. For 
purposes of this section, a material error is defined as results 
differing by more than two standard deviations. Acceptance or rejection 
of that portion of grain shall be based on the reinspection or appeal 
inspection and on the Board appeal inspection result alone when a 
material error is found.
    (ii) Entire lot. The applicant may request a reinspection service, 
an appeal inspection service, and a Board appeal inspection service on 
the entire lot. Inspection results for these services shall replace the 
previous inspection results. The tolerances shall be reapplied to all 
portions of the entire lot to determine acceptance or rejection.
    (d) Infested grain--(1) Available options. If gain or any portion of 
grain in a single shiplot, unit train, or lash barge lot is found to be 
infested, according to the provisions of the Official

[[Page 260]]

U.S. Standards for Grain, the applicant shall be promptly notified and 
have the option of:
    (i) Unloading the portion of infested grain from the lot and an 
additional amount of other grain in common stowage with the infested 
grain; or
    (ii) When applicable, completing the loading and treating all 
infested grain in the lot; or
    (iii) When applicable, treating the infested grain for the purpose 
of destroying the insects, subject to subsequent examination by official 
personnel; or
    (iv) Continue loading without treating the infested grain, in which 
case all of the infested grain in the lot and all grain in common 
stowage areas with the infested grain will be officially certificated as 
infested according to the provisions of the Official U.S. Standards for 
Grain.
    (2) Exception. If infested grain in loaded into common stowage with 
a lot, or a portion of a lot, which has not been officially certificated 
as being infested, the applicant loading the infested grain may not use 
the option in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section.
    (3) With treatment. If infested grain is treated with a fumigant in 
accordance with the instructions and the treatment is witnessed by 
official personnel, the official sampling, inspection, grading, and 
certification of the lot shall continue as though the infested condition 
did not exist.
    (e) Special certification procedures--(1) Rejected grain. When grain 
is rejected by the inspection plan under paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section, the official inspection certificate for each different portion 
of different quality shall show:
    (i) A statement that the grain has been loaded aboard with grain of 
other quality;
    (ii) The grade, location, or other identification and approximate 
quanity of grain in the portions; and
    (iii) Other information required by the regulations and the 
instructions.

The requirement of paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section does not apply to 
grain that is inspected as it is unloaded from the carrier or to 
portions loaded in separate carriers or stowage space.
    (2) Common stowage. (i) Without separation. When bulk grain is 
offered for official inspection as it is loaded aboard a ship and is 
loaded without separation in a stowage area with other grain or another 
commodity, the official inspection certificate for the grain in each lot 
shall show the kind, the grade, if known, and the location of the other 
grain, or the kind and location of the other commodity in the adjacent 
lots.
    (ii) With separation. When separations are laid between lots, the 
official inspection certificates shall show the kind of material used in 
the separations and the locations of the separations in relation to each 
lot.
    (iii) Exception. The common stowage requirements of this paragraph 
are not applicable to the first lot in a stowage area unless a second 
lot is loaded, in whole or in part, in the stowage area prior to issuing 
the official inspection certificate for the first lot.
    (3) Protein. A special statement indicating the actual protein range 
of a lot shall be shown on the official inspection certificate if the 
difference between the lowest and highest protein determinations for the 
lot exceeds 1.0 percent when protein is officially determined and a 
specific range limit is not established by the contract grade.
    (4) Part lot. If part of a lot of grain in an inbound carrier is 
unloaded and part is left in the carrier, the unloaded grain shall be 
officially inspected and certificated in accordance with the provisions 
of Sec. 800.84(g).
    (5) Official mark. If the grain in a single lot is officially 
inspected for grade as it is being loaded, upon request, the following 
official mark shall be shown on the inspection certificate: ``Loaded 
under continuous official inspection.''

Sec. 800.88  Loss of identity.

    (a) Lots. Except as noted in paragraph (d) of this section, the 
indentity of a lot of grain shall be considered lost if (1) a portion of 
the grain is unloaded, transferred, or otherwise removed from the 
carrier or container in which the grain was located at the time of the 
original inspection; or (2) a portion of grain or other material, 
including additives, is added to the lot after the orginal inspection 
was performed, unless the addition of the additive was performed in 
accordance with the regulations and the instructions. At the option of 
official personnel performing a reinspection, appeal inspection, or 
Board appeal inspection service, the identity of grain in a closed 
carrier or container shall be considered lost if the carrier or 
container is not sealed or if the seal record is incomplete.
    (b) Carriers and containers. The indentity of a carrier or container 
shall be considered lost when (1) the stowage area is cleaned, painted, 
treated, fumigated, or fitted after the original inspection was 
performed; or (2) the identification of the carrier or container has 
been changed since the original inspection was performed.
    (c) Submitted samples. The identity of a submitted sample of grain 
shall be considered lost when (1) the identifying number, mark, or 
symbol for the sample is lost or destroyed or (2) the samples have not 
been retained and protected by official personnel as prescribed in the 
instructions.
    (d) Additives.\1\ If additives are applied during loading to 
outbound, including export, grain after sampling or during unloading to 
inbound grain before sampling for the purpose of insect or fungi 
control, dust suppression, or identification, the inspection certificate 
shall show a statement showing the type and purpose of the additive 
application, except that no statement is required to be shown when the 
additive is a fumigant applied for the purpose of insect control.

<R05>
Sec. 800.96  Weighing procedures.

    (a) Inbound. Inbound grain that is to be weighed must be routed 
directly from the carrier and cannot be cleaned, dried, or otherwise 
processed to remove or add other grain or material en route. Except as 
noted in paragraph (c) of this section, the identity of an inbound lot 
shall be considered lost when a portion of the lot is transferred or 
otherwise removed prior to weighing or a portion of grain or other 
material is added to the lot prior to weighing. When loss of identity 
occurs, no amount shall be shown in the ``Net Weight'' portion of the 
weight certificate for the lot.
    (b) Outbound. Outbound grain that has been weighed must be routed 
directly from the scale to the carrier and cannot be cleaned, dried, or 
otherwise processed to remove or add other grain or material en route. 
Except as noted in paragraph (c) of this section, the identity of an 
outbound lot will be considered lost if a portion of the lot is 
transferred or otherwise removed from the lot after weighing or a 
portion of grain or other material is added to the lot after weighing. 
When loss of identity occurs, no amount shall be shown in the ``Net 
Weight'' portion of the weight certificate for the lot.
    (c) Exceptions--(1) Spills. (i) Outbound. (A) Replaced. If a spill 
occurs in handling and loading of outbound grain and the spilled grain 
is retrieved, or is replaced in kind, and is loaded on board during the 
loading operations, the weight certificate shall show the weight of the 
grain that was physically loaded on board. Upon request of the 
applicant, an additional certificate may be issued by the agency or the 
field office to show the weight of the additional grain that was used to 
replace a spill.
    (B) Not replaced. If a spill occurs in the handling and loading of 
outbound grain and the spilled grain is not retrieved or is not replaced 
during the loading operation, the weight certificate shall show the 
weight of the grain that was actually weighed, minus the estimated 
amount of the grain that was spilled. Upon request of the applicant, an 
additional certificate may be issued showing the estimated amount of 
grain that was spilled. The applicant may, upon request, have the total 
amount that was weighed shown on the weight certificate with the 
estimated amount of the spilled grain noted.
    (ii) Inbound. If a spill occurs in the handling of inbound grain and 
the grain is not retrieved and weighed, the weight certificate shall 
show the weight of the grain that was actually unloaded from the carrier 
and a statement regarding the spill as prescribed in the instructions.
    (2) Additives. \1\ If additives are applied during loading to 
outbound, including export, grain after weighing or during unloading to 
inbound grain before weighing for the purpose of insect or fungi 
control, dust suppression, or identification, the weight certificate 
shall show the actual weight of the grain after the application of the 
additive for inbound grain or the actual weight of the grain prior to 
the application of the additive for outbound or export grain and a 
statement showing the type and purpose of the additive application, 
except that no statement is required to be shown when the additive is a 
fumigant applied for the purpose of insect control.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Elevators, other handlers of grain, and their agents are 
responsible for the additive's proper usage and application. Compliance 
with this section does not excuse compliance with applicable Federal, 
State, and local laws.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Dust. If dust is removed during the handling of grain, the 
weight certificate shall not be adjusted to reflect the weight of the 
removed dust.
    (4) Commingled carriers. If grain from two or more identified 
carriers becomes mixed, (i) the combined weight of the grain shall be 
shown in the ``Net Weight'' block of one certificate with all carrier 
identification shown in the identification of carrier section of the 
certificate, or (ii) upon request of the applicant, a certificate shall 
be issued for each carrier with the ``Net Weight'' block crossed out, 
and with the total combined weight unloaded and the

[[Page 265]]

identification of the other carrier(s) shown in the ``Remarks'' section.
    (5) Unremoved grain. If, after unloading an inbound carrier, there 
is sound grain remaining in the carrier that could have been removed 
with reasonable effort, the weight certificate shall show the weight of 
the grain that was actually unloaded from the carrier and a statement 
regarding the grain remaining in the carrier.

Sec. 800.97  Weighing grain in containers, land carriers, barges, and shiplots.

    (a) General. The weighing of grain loaded or unloaded from any 
carrier shall be conducted according to this section and the 
instructions.
    (b) Procedure--(1) General. If grain in a carrier is offered for 
inspection or weighing service as one lot, the grain shall be weighed 
and certificated as one lot. The identification of the carrier shall be 
recorded on the scale tape or ticket and the weight certificate.
    (2) Sacked grain. If sacked grain is offered for weighing and the 
grain is not fully accessible, the request for weighing service shall be 
dismissed.
    (3) Part lots. If a portion of an inbound lot of grain is unloaded 
and a portion is left in the carrier because it is not uniform in 
quality or condition, or the lot is unloaded in other than a reasonably 
continuous operation, the portion that is removed and the portion 
remaining in the carrier shall be considered as part lots and shall be 
weighed and certificated as part lots.
    (c) Certification of trucklots, carlots, and bargelots--(1) Basic 
requirement. One official certificate shall be issued for the weighing 
of the grain in each truck, trailer, truck/trailer(s) combination, 
railroad car, barge, or similarly sized carrier. This requirement shall 
not be applicable to grain weighed as a combined lot under Sec. 800.98.
    (2) Part-lot weight certificates. A part-lot weight certificate 
shall show (i) the weight of the portion that is unloaded and (ii) the 
following statement: ``Part-lot: The net weight stated herein reflects a 
partial unload.''
    (d) Certification of shiplot grain--(1) Basic requirement. The 
certificate shall show (i) if applicable, a statement that the grain has 
been loaded aboard with other grain, (ii) the official weight, (iii) the 
stowage or other identification of the grain, and (iv) other information 
required by the regulations and the instructions.
    (2) Common stowage. (i) Without separation. If bulk grain is offered 
for weighing as it is being loaded aboard a ship and is loaded without 
separation in a stowage area with other grain or another commodity, the 
weight certificate for the grain in each lot shall show that the lot was 
loaded aboard with other grain or another commodity without separation 
and the relative location of the grain.
    (ii) With separation. If separations are laid between adjacent lots, 
the weight certificates shall show the kind of material used in the 
separations and the location of the separations in relation to each lot.
    (iii) Exception. The common stowage requirements of this paragraph 
shall not be applicable to the first lot in a stowage area unless a 
second lot has been loaded, in whole or in part, in the stowage area 
before issuing the official weight certificate for the first lot.
    (3) Official mark. If the grain is officially weighed in a 
reasonably continuous operation, upon request by the applicant, the 
following statement may be shown on the weight certificate: ``Loaded 
under continuous official weighing.''

<R05>
Sec. 800.98  Weighing grain in combined lots.

    (a) General. The weighing of bulk or sacked grain loaded aboard, or 
being loaded aboard, or unloaded from two or more carriers as a combined 
lot shall be conducted according to this section and the instructions.
    (b) Weighing procedure. (1) Single lot weighing. Single lots of 
grain that are to be weighed as a combined lot shall be weighed in one 
location. The grain loaded into or unloaded from each carrier must be 
weighed in accordance with procedures prescribed in the instructions. In 
the case of sacked grain, a representative weight sample shall be 
obtained from the grain in each carrier unless otherwise specified in 
the instructions.

[[Page 266]]

    (2) Recertification. Grain that has been weighed and certificated as 
two or more single lots may be recertificated as a combined lot provided 
that (i) the grain in each single lot has been weighed in one location, 
(ii) the original weight certificates issued for the single lots have 
been or will be surrendered to the appropriate agency or field office, 
(iii) the official personnel who performed the weighing service for the 
single lots and the official personnel who are to recertificate the 
grain as a combined lot determine that the weight of the grain in the 
lots has not since changed and, in the case of sacked grain, that the 
weight samples used as a basis for weighing the single lots were 
representative at the time of the weighing.
    (3) Grain uniform in quality. An applicant may request that grain be 
weighed and certificated as a combined lot whether or not the grain is 
uniform in quality for the purpose of inspection under the Act.
    (c) Certification procedures--(1) General. Each certificate for a 
combined-lot Class X or Class Y weighing service shall show the 
identification for the ``Combined lot'' or, at the request of the 
applicant, the identification of each carrier in the combined lot. The 
identification and any seal information for the carriers may be shown on 
the reverse side of the weight certificate, provided the statement ``See 
reverse side'' is shown on the face of the certificate in the space 
provided for remarks.
    (2) Recertification. If a request for a combined-lot Class X or 
Class Y weighing service is filed after the grain in the single lots has 
been weighed and certificated, the combined-lot weighing certificate 
shall show (i) the date of weighing the grain in the combined lot (if 
the single lots were weighed on different dates, the latest of the dates 
shall be shown); (ii) a serial number, other than the serial numbers of 
the weight certificates that are to be superseded; (iii) the name of the 
elevator from which or into which the grain in the combined lot was 
loaded or unloaded; (iv) a statement showing the weight of the grain in 
the combined lot; (v) a completed statement showing the identification 
of any superseded certificate as follows: ``This combined-lot 
certificate supersedes certificate Nos. ----, dated ----; and (vi) if at 
the time of issuing the combined-lot weight certificate the superseded 
certificates are not in the custody of the agency or field office, the 
statement ``The superseded certificates identified herein have not been 
surrendered'' shall be clearly shown, in the space provided for remarks, 
beneath the statement identifying the superseded certificates. If the 
superseded certificates are in the custody of the agency or field 
office, the superseded certificates shall be clearly marked ``Void.''
    (3) Part lot. If a part of a combined lot of grain in inbound 
carriers is unloaded and a part is left in the carriers, the grain that 
is unloaded shall be certificated in accordance with the provisions in 
Sec. 800.97(c)(2).
    (4) Official mark. When grain is weighed as a combined lot in one 
continuous operation, upon request by the applicant, the following 
statement shall be shown on the weight certificate: ``Loaded under 
continuous official weighing,'' or ``Loaded under continuous official 
inspection and weighing.''
    (5) Further combining. After a combined-lot weight certificate has 
been issued, there shall be no further combining and no dividing of the 
certificate.
    (6) Limitations. No combined-lot weight certificate shall be issued 
(i) for any weighing service other than as described in this section or 
(ii) which shows a weight of grain different from the total of the 
combined single lot.

<R05>
Sec. 800.99  Checkweighing sacked grain.

    (a) General. Each checkweighing service performed on a lot of sacked 
grain to determine the weight of the grain shall be made on the basis of 
one or more official weight samples obtained from the grain by official 
personnel according to this section and procedures prescribed in the 
instructions.
    (b) Representative sample. No official weight sample shall be 
considered to be representative of a lot of sacked grain unless the 
sample is of the size prescribed in the instructions and has been 
obtained and weighed according

[[Page 267]]

to the procedures prescribed in the instructions.
    (c) Protecting samples and data. Official personnel and other 
employees of an agency or the Service shall protect official weight 
samples and data from manipulation, substitution, and improper and 
careless handling which might deprive the samples and sample data of 
their representativeness.
    (d) Restriction on weighing. No agency shall weigh any lot of sacked 
grain unless at the time of obtaining the official weight sample the 
grain from which the sample was obtained was located within the area of 
responsibility assigned to the agency, except as otherwise provided for 
in Sec. 800.117, or on a case-by-case basis as determined by the 
Administrator.
    (e) Equipment and labor. Each applicant for weighing services shall 
provide necessary labor for obtaining official weight samples and place 
the samples in a position for weighing and shall supply suitable 
weighing equipment approved by the Service, pursuant to the regulations 
and the instructions.
    (f) Disposition of official weight samples. In weighing sacked grain 
in lots, the grain in the official weight samples shall be returned to 
the lots from which the samples were obtained.
    (g) Provisions by kinds of service--(1) ``IN'' movements. Each 
checkweighing on an ``IN'' movement of sacked grain shall be based on an 
official weight sample obtained while the grain is at rest in the 
carrier or during unloading, in accordance with procedures prescribed in 
the instructions.
    (2) ``OUT'' movements (export). Each checkweighing of sacked export 
grain shall be based on an official weight sample obtained as the grain 
is being loaded aboard the final carrier, as the grain is being sacked, 
or while the grain is at rest in a warehouse or holding facility, in 
accordance with procedures prescribed in the instructions.
    (3) ``OUT'' movements (other than export). Each checkweighing of an 
``OUT'' movement of nonexport sacked grain shall be based on an official 
weight sample obtained from the grain as the grain is being loaded in 
the carrier, or while the grain is at rest in the carrier, or while the 
grain is at rest in a warehouse or holding facility, or while the grain 
is being sacked, in accordance with procedures prescribed in the 
instructions.
    (4) ``LOCAL'' weighing. Each checkweighing of a ``LOCAL'' movement 
of sacked grain shall be based on an official weight sample obtained 
while the grain is at rest or while the grain is being transferred, in 
accordance with procedures prescribed in the instructions.

     Official Reinspection Services and Review of Weighing Services


<R05>
Sec. 800.125  Who may request reinspection services or review of 
weighing services.

    (a) General. Any interested person may request a reinspection or 
review of weighing service, except as provided

[[Page 269]]

for in Sec. 800.86(c)(5). Only one reinspection service or review of 
weighing service may be performed on any original service. When more 
than one interested person requests a reinspection or review of weighing 
service, the first person to file is the applicant of record.
    (b) Kind and scope of request. A reinspection or review of weighing 
service is limited to the kind and scope of the original service. If the 
request specifies a different kind or scope, the request shall be 
dismissed but may be resubmitted as a request for original services: 
Provided, however, that an applicant for service may request a 
reinspection of a specific factor(s), official grade and factors, or 
official criteria. In addition, reinspections for grade may include a 
review of any pertinent factor(s), as deemed necessary by official 
personnel. Official criteria are considered separately from official 
grade or official factors when determining the kind and scope. When 
requested, a reinspection for official grade or official factors and 
official criteria may be handled separately even though both sets of 
results are reported on the same certificate. Moreover, a reinspection 
or review of weighing may be requested on either the inspection or Class 
X weighing results when both results are reported on a combination 
inspection and Class X weight certificate.

that performed the original service. All requests shall include the 
information specified in Sec. 800.46. Verbal requests shall be 
confirmed in writing when requested by official personnel. Copies of 
request forms may be obtained from the agency or field office. If at the 
time the request is filed the documentation required by Sec. 800.46 is 
not available, official personnel may, at their discretion, withhold 
services pending the receipt of the required documentation. A 
reinspection certificate or the results of a review of weighing service 
shall not be issued unless (1) the documentation requested under Sec. 
800.46 has been submitted or (2) official personnel determine sufficient 
information has been made available so as to perform the requested 
service. A record that sufficient information was made available shall 
be included in the record of the official service.
    (b) Request requirements. Requests will be considered filed on the 
date they are received by official personnel. A record shall be 
maintained for all requests.
    (1) Reinspection services. Requests shall be received (i) before the 
grain has left the specified service point where the grain was located 
when the original inspection was performed; (ii) no later than the close 
of business on the second business day following the date of the 
original inspection; and (iii) before the identity of the grain has been 
lost. If a representative file sample, as prescribed in Sec. 800.82, is 
available, official personnel may waive the requirements pursuant to 
this subparagraph. The requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section may be waived only upon written consent of the applicant and all 
interested persons. The requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) and (iii) 
of this section may be waived at the request of the applicant or other 
interested persons. The requirement of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this

800.160 and the instructions. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section, only the result of the reinspection service shall be 
reported.
    (1) Results of material portion sublots. When results of a 
reinspection on a material portion do not detect a material error, they 
shall be averaged with the original inspection results. For purposes of 
this section, a material error is defined as results differing by more 
than two standard deviations. The averaged inspection results shall 
replace the original inspection results recorded on the official 
inspection log. Reinspection results shall replace the original 
inspection results recorded on the official inspection log if a material 
error is detected. No certificates will be issued unless requested by 
the applicant or deemed necessary by official personnel.
    (2) Reporting review of weighing results. When the review of 
weighing service results indicate that the original weighing results 
were correct, the applicant will be notified in writing. When the 
original weighing service results are incorrect, a corrected weight 
certificate or, if applicable, a corrected combination inspection and 
Class X weight certificate will be issued according to the provisions of

                       Appeal Inspection Services


<R05>
Sec. 800.135  Who may request appeal inspection services.

    (a) General. Any interested person may request appeal inspection or 
Board appeal inspection services, except as provided for in Sec. 
800.86(c)(5). When more than one interested person requests an appeal 
inspection or Board appeal inspection service, the first person to file 
is the applicant of record. Only one appeal inspection may be obtained 
from any original inspection or reinspection service. Only one Board 
appeal inspection may be obtained from an appeal inspection. Board 
appeal inspections will be performed on the basis of the official file 
sample. Board appeal inspections are not available on stowage 
examination services.

[[Page 271]]

    (b) Kind and scope of request. An appeal inspection service is 
limited to the kind and scope of the original or reinspection service; 
or, in the case of a Board Appeal inspection service, the kind and scope 
of the appeal inspection service. If the request specifies a different 
kind or scope, the request shall be dismissed but may be resubmitted as 
a request for original services: Provided, however, that an applicant 
for service may request an appeal or Board Appeal inspection of a 
specific factor(s), official grade and factors, or official criteria. In 
addition, appeal and Board Appeal inspections for grade may include a 
review of any pertinent factor(s), as deemed necessary by official 
personnel. Official criteria are considered separately from official 
grade or official factors when determining kind and scope. When 
requested, an appeal inspection for grade, or official factors, and 
official criteria may be handled separately even though both results are 
reported on the same certificate. Moreover, an appeal inspection may be 
requested on the inspection results when both inspection and Class X 
weighing results are reported on a combination inspection and Class X 
weight certificate.

<R05>
Sec. 800.136  How to request appeal inspection services.

    (a) General. Requests shall be filed with the field office 
responsible for the area in which the original service was performed. 
Requests for Board appeal inspections may be filed with the Board of 
Appeals and Review or the field office that performed the appeal 
inspection. All requests shall include the information specified in 
Sec. 800.46. Verbal requests shall be confirmed in writing when 
requested by official personnel as specified in Sec. 800.46. Copies of 
request forms may be obtained from the field office upon request. If at 
the time the request is filed the documentation required by Sec. 800.46 
is not available, official personnel may, at their discretion, withhold 
service pending the receipt of the required documentation. An appeal 
inspection certificate will not be issued unless (1) documentation 
requested under Sec. 800.46 has been submitted or (2) office personnel 
determine that sufficient information has been made available so as to 
perform the request. A record that sufficient information has been made 
available must be included in the record of the official service.
    (b) Filing requirements. Requests will be considered filed on the 
date they are received by official personnel. A record shall be 
maintained for all requests. Requests must be filed (1) before the grain 
has left the specified service point where the grain was located when 
the original inspection was performed, (2) no later than the close of 
business on the second business day following the date of the last 
inspection, and (3) before the identity of the grain has been lost. If a 
representative file sample as prescribed in Sec. 800.82 is available, 
official personnel may waive the requirements pursuant to this 
paragraph. The requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be 
waived only upon written consent of the applicant and all interested 
persons. The requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this 
section may be waived at the request of the applicant or other 
interested persons. The requirement of paragraph (b)(2) of this section 
may also be waived upon satisfactory showing by an interested person of 
evidence of fraud or that because of distance or other good cause, the 
time allowed for filing was not sufficient. A record of each waiver 
shall be included in the record of the appeal inspection service.

<R05>
Sec. 800.137  Who shall perform appeal inspection services.

    (a) Appeal. Appeal inspection services shall be performed by the 
field office responsible for the area in which the original inspection 
was performed.
    (b) Board appeal. Board appeal inspection services shall be 
performed only by the Board of Appeals and Review.

[[Page 272]]

The field office that performed the appeal inspection service will act 
as a liaison between the Board of Appeals and Review and the applicant.

<R05>
Sec. 800.138  Conflict of interest.

    Official personnel cannot perform or participate in performing or 
issue an official certificate for an appeal inspection if they 
participated in the original inspection, reinspection, or, in the case 
of a Board appeal inspection, the appeal inspection service unless there 
is only one qualified person available at the time and place of the 
appeal inspection.

<R05>
Sec. 800.139  Certificating appeal inspections.

    (a) General. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) of this section, 
official certificate shall be issued according to Sec. 800.160 and the 
instructions. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, 
only the results of the appeal inspection service shall be reported.
    (b) Results of material portion sublots. When results of an appeal 
inspection performed by a field office or the Board of Appeals and 
Review on a material portion do not detect a material error, they shall 
be averaged with the previous inspection results recorded on the 
official inspection log for the identified sample. For purposes of this 
section, a material error is defined as results differing by more than 
two standard deviations. The appeal or Board appeal inspection result 
shall replace the previous inspection results recorded on the official 
inspection log for the identified sample if a material error is 
detected. No certificate will be issued unless requested by the 
applicant or deemed necessary by inspection personnel.
    (c) Required statements. Each appeal certificate shall show the 
statements required by this section, Sec. 800.161, and applicable 
instructions.
    (1) Each appeal inspection certificate shall clearly show (i) the 
term ``Appeal'' or ``Board appeal'' and (ii) a statement identifying the 
superseded certificate. The superseded certificate will be considered 
null and void as of the date of the appeal inspection certificate.
    (2) When official grade or official factors, Class X weighing 
results, and official criteria are reported on the same certificate, the 
appeal inspection certificate shall show a statement indicating that 
appeal or Board appeal inspection results are based on official grade, 
official factors, or official criteria and that all other results are 
those of the original, reinspection, or, in the case of a Board appeal, 
the appeal inspection results.
    (3) Superseded certificates held by the Service shall be marked 
``Void.'' If the superseded certificate is not in the custody of the 
Service at the time the appeal certificate is issued, a statement 
indicating that the superseded certificate has not been surrendered 
shall be shown on the appeal certificate.
    (4) As of the date of issuance of the appeal or Board appeal 
certificate, the superseded certificate for the original, reinspection, 
or appeal inspection service will be void and shall not be used to 
represent the grain.
    (5) When certificates are issued under paragraph (b) of this 
section, the appeal inspection certificate shall show a statement 
indicating that the results replace the original inspection, 
reinspection, or, in the case of a Board appeal, the appeal inspection 
results and that the appeal inspection certificate is not valid for 
trading purposes.
    (d) Finality of Board appeal inspections. A Board appeal inspection 
will be the final appeal inspection service.

Sec. 800.187  Conflicts of interest

    (a) General. Warehouse samplers are exempt from the conflict-of-
interest provisions of this section.
    (b) What constitutes a gratuity. For the purposes of these 
regulations, the term ``gratuity'' shall include any favor, 
entertainment, gift, tip, loan, payment for unauthorized or fictitious 
work, unusual discount, or anything of monetary value. The term shall 
not include (1) the occasional exchange of a cup of coffee or similar 
social courtesies of nominal value in a business or work relationship if 
the exchange is wholly free of any embarrassing or improper 
implications; (2) the acceptance of unsolicited advertising material 
such as pencils, pens, and note pads of nominal value if the material is 
wholly free of any embarrassing or improper implications; and (3) the 
exchange of the usual courtesies in an obvious family or personal 
relationship (including those between official personnel and their 
parents, spouses, children, or close personal friends) when the 
circumstances make it clear that the exchange is the result of the 
family or personal relationship, rather than a business or work 
relationship.
    (c) Conflicts. In addition to the conflicts of interest prohibited 
by section 11 of the Act, the activities specified in this paragraph 
shall also be considered to be a conflict of interest. Accordingly, no 
official personnel shall, during the term of their license or 
authorization (including any period of suspension):
    (1) Accept any gratuity.
    (2) Accept any fee or charge or other thing of monetary value, in 
addition to the published fee or charge, for the performance of official 
inspection or weighing services under circumstances in which the 
acceptance could result, or create the appearance of resulting, in (i) 
the use of their office or position for undue private gain, (ii) an 
undertaking to give undue preferential treatment to any group or any 
person, or (iii) any other loss of independence or impartiality in the 
performance of official inspection or Class X or Class Y weighing 
services.
    (3) Knowingly perform, or participate in performing, an inspection 
or weighing service on grain in which they have a direct or indirect 
financial interest.
    (4) Engage in the business by buying, selling, transporting, 
cleaning, elevating, storing, binning, mixing, blending, drying, 
treating, fumigating, or other preparation of grain (other than a grower 
of grain, or in the disposition of inspection samples); or in the 
business of cleaning, treating, or fitting carriers or containers for 
transporting or storing grain; the merchandising for nonfarm use of 
equipment for cleaning, drying, treating, fumigating, or otherwise 
processing, handling, or storing grain; or the merchandising of grain 
inspection or weighing equipment (other than buying or selling by 
official personnel of the equipment for use in the performance of their 
official services).
    (5) Seek or hold any appointive or elective office in a grain 
industry organization or association. This provision does not apply to 
organizations of official inspectors or official weighers.
    (6) Participate in any transaction involving the purchase or sale of 
corporate stocks or bonds, grain or grain-related commodities, or other 
property for speculative or income purposes if the transaction could 
reasonably be construed to interfere with the proper and impartial 
performance of official inspection for Class X or Class Y

[[Page 289]]

weighing services. Official personnel are not prohibited from (i) 
producing grain as a grower and selling the grain; (ii) making bona fide 
investments in governmental obligations, banking institutions, savings 
and loan associations, and other tangibles and intangibles that are 
clearly not involved in the production, transportation, storage, 
marketing, or processing of grain; or (iii) borrowing money from banks 
or other financial institutions on customary terms.
    (d) Reports of interests. Official personnel shall report 
information regarding their employment or other business or financial 
interests which may be required by the Service.
    (e) Avoiding conflicts of interest. Official personnel shall not 
acquire any financial interest or engage in any activity that would 
result in a violation of this Sec. 800.187, or Sec. 800.186, or 
section 11 of the Act and shall not permit their spouses, minor 
children, or blood relatives who reside in their immediate households to 
acquire any such interest or engage in any such activity. For the 
purpose of this section, the interest of a spouse, minor child, or blood 
relative who is a resident of the immediate household of official 
personnel shall be considered to be an interest of the official 
personnel.
    (f) Disposing of a conflict of interest--(1) Remedial action. Upon 
being informed that a conflict of interest exists and that remedial 
action is required, an applicant for a license and official personnel 
shall take immediate action to end the conflict of interest and inform 
the Service of the action taken.
    (2) Hardship cases. Applicants and official personnel who believe 
that remedial action will cause undue personal hardship may request an 
exception by forwarding to the Service a written statement setting forth 
the facts, circumstances, and reasons for requesting an exception.
    (3) Failure to terminate. If a final determination is made by the 
Service that a conflict of interest does exist and should not be 
excepted, failure to terminate the conflict of interest shall subject: 
(i) An applicant for a license to a dismissal of the application; (ii) 
An employee of the Service to disciplinary action; and (iii) A licensee 
to license revocation.

reason(s) for the dismissal.
    (f) Responsibilities--(1) Providing official services. Each

official personnel on the basis of job qualifications rather than 
political affiliations. The State shall employ sufficient personnel to 
provide the services normally requested in an accurate and timely 
manner. The State shall only use personnel licensed by the Service for 
the performance of official services and shall train and assist its 
personnel in acquiring and maintaining the necessary skills. The State 
shall keep the Service informed of the employment status of each of its 
licensees and any substantial change in a licensee's duties.

direct supervision of the daily activities of such personnel, and for 
the conduct of official services and related activities in the State. 
The State shall supervise official activities according to the Act, 
regulations, and instructions and shall take action necessary to ensure 
that its employees are not performing prohibited functions and are not 
involved in any action prohibited by the Act, regulations, or 
instructions. Each State shall report to the Service information which 
shows or may show a violation of any provision of the Act, regulations,

instructions.
    (5) Conflict of interest. (i) General. The delegated State and any 
commissioner, director, employee, or other related

[[Page 291]]

person or entity shall not have a conflict of interest, as defined in

a certificate control system for all official certificates it receives, 
issues, voids, or otherwise renders useless. The system shall provide 
for: (i) Recording the numbers of the official certificates printed or 
received; (ii) protecting unused certificates from fraudulent or 
unauthorized use; and (iii) maintaining a file copy of each certificate 
issued, voided, or otherwise rendered useless in a manner that would 
permit retrieval.
    (10) Records. Each delegated State shall maintain the records 
specified in Sec. Sec. 800.145 through 800.159.
    (g) Termination--(1) Automatic termination. Failure to pay the user 
fees prescribed by the Service for supervisory costs related to official 
inspection and weighing services within 30 days after due shall result 
in the automatic termination of the delegation. The delegation shall be 
reinstated if fees currently due, plus interest and any further expenses 
incurred by the Service because of the termination, are paid within 60 
days after the termination.
    (2) Voluntary cancellation. A State may request that its delegation 
be canceled by giving 90 days written notice to the Service.
    (3) Revocation. (i) Without hearing. The Administrator may revoke 
the delegation of a State without first affording the State opportunity 
for a hearing. Unless otherwise provided, the revocation shall be 
effective when the State receives a notice from the Service regarding

locations) in the United States.
    (d) When and how to apply. An application for designation should be

Service; (2) shall be typewritten or legibly written in English; (3) 
shall show or be accompanied by documents which show all information 
requested on the form, or otherwise required by the Service; and (4)

    (e) Review of conditions and criteria for designation--(1) 
Application. Each application for a designation shall be reviewed to 
determine whether it complies with paragraph (d) of this section. If an 
application is not in compliance, the applicant shall be provided an 
opportunity to submit the needed information. If the needed information 
is not submitted within a reasonable time, as determined by the Service, 
the application may be dismissed. When an application is dismissed, the 
Service shall notify the applicant, in writing, of the reason(s) for the 
dismissal.
    (2) Applicant. Each applicant for authority to operate as as 
designated agency shall be reviewed to determine whether the applicant 
meets the conditions and criteria contained in sections 7(f)(1)(A) and 
(B) of the Act, Sec. 800.199 of the regulations, and paragraph (g) of 
this section. The requested designation may be granted if the Service

for official services; (ii) the applicant meets the conditions and 
criteria specified in the Act and regulations; and (iii) the applicant 
is better able than any other applicant to provide official services.
    (f) Area of responsibility--(1) General. Each agency shall be

local government, shall not exceed the jurisdictional boundaries of the 
State or the local government, unless otherwise approved by the Service. 
The area of responsibility may not include any export elevators at 
export port locations or any portion of an area of responsibility 
assigned to another agency that is performing the same functions, except 
as otherwise provided in Sec. 800.117. A designated agency may perform 
official services at locations outside its assigned area of 
responsibility only after obtaining approval from the Service, or in 
accordance with provisions set forth in Sec. 800.117.
    (2) Amending. A request for an amendment to an assigned area of 
responsibility shall (i) be submitted to the Service in writing; (ii) 
specify the change desired; (iii) be signed by the applicant or its

objectives of the Act, regulations, and instructions. Upon a finding of 
need, the Service may initiate action to change an assigned area of 
responsibility.
    (3) Specified service points. An agency may change its specified 
service points by notifying the Service in advance. Interested persons

responsibility by contacting the agency. The list shall include all 
specified service points and shall identify each specified service point 
which operates on an intermittent or seasonal basis.
    (g) Responsibilities--(1) Providing official services. Insofar as 
practicable,

[[Page 293]]

each agency shall be responsible for providing at all locations in its 
assigned area each service authorized by the designation. An agency may, 
subject to Service approval, make arrangements with a neighboring agency 
to provide official services requested infrequently. The agency shall 
perform all official services according to the Act, regulations, and 
instructions in effect at the time of designation or which may be 
promulgated subsequently.

employ sufficient personnel to provide the official services normally 
requested in an accurate and timely manner. Each agency shall only use 
personnel licensed by the Service for the performance of official 
services and shall train and assist its personnel in acquiring and 
maintaining the necessary skills. Each agency shall keep the Service 
informed of the employment status of each of its licensees and any 
substantial change in a licensee's duties.
    (ii) State agencies. State agencies shall employ official personnel 
on the basis of job qualifications rather than political affiliations.
    (4) Rotation of personnel. Where feasible, each agency shall rotate 
licensees among elevators and other facilities as is necessary to 
preserve the integrity of the official inspection and weighing systems.
    (5) Supervision. The agency and its officials shall be responsible 
for the actions of the official personnel employed by the agency, for 
direct supervision of the daily activities of such personnel, and for 
the conduct of official services and related activities at the agency. 
The agency shall supervise official activities, in accordance with the 
Act, regulations, and instructions, and shall take action necessary to 
ensure that its employees are not performing prohibited functions and 
are not involved in any action prohibited by the Act, regulations, or 
instructions. Each agency shall report to the responsible field office 
information which shows or may show a violation of any provision of the 
Act, regulations, or instructions and information on any instructions 
which have been issued to agency personnel by Service personnel or by 
any other person which are inconsistent with the Act, regulations, or 
instructions.
    (6) Conflict of interest. (i) General. Each agency and any officer, 
director, stockholder, employee, or other related entity shall not have 
a conflict of interest, as defined in Section 11 of the Act and Sec. 
800.199 of the regulations. A conflict of interest may be waived 
pursuant to Sec. 800.199(d). The agency shall advise the Service 
immediately of any proposed change in name, ownership, officers or 
directors, or control of the agency and, if a trust, any change 
affecting the trust agreement.

the agency or personnel employed by the agency shall not perform any 
unofficial service that is the same as the official services covered by

    (7) Facilities and equipment. (i) General. The laboratory and office 
facilities of each agency shall be: Located; equipped; and large enough 
so that requested services are provided in an orderly and timely manner.
    (ii) Equipment testing. Each agency shall test the equipment it uses 
for official services according to the instructions.
    (8) Security. Each agency shall provide sufficient security to 
ensure that official samples, records, equipment, and forms are 
reasonably secure from theft, alteration, or misuse.
    (9) Certificate control system. Each agency shall establish a 
certificate control system for all official certificates it receives, 
issues, voids, or otherwise renders useless. The system shall provide 
for (i) recording the numbers of the official certificates printed or 
received; (ii) protecting unused certificates from fraudulent or 
unauthorized use; and (iii) maintaining a file copy of each certificate 
issued, voided, or otherwise rendered useless in a manner that would 
permit retrieval.
    (10) Records. Each agency shall maintain the records specified in 
Sec. Sec. 800.145 through 800.159.
    (h) Termination and renewal--(1) Triennial--(i) Termination. A 
designation shall terminate at a time specified by the Administrator, 
but not later than 3

[[Page 294]]

years after the effective date of the designation. A notice of triennial 
termination shall be issued by the Service to a designated agency at 
least 120 calendar days in advance of the termination date. The notice 
shall provide instructions for requesting renewal of the designation. 
Failure to receive a notice from the Service shall not exempt a 
designated agency from the responsibility of having its designation 
renewed on or before the specified termination date.
    (ii) Renewal. Designations may be renewed, upon application, in 
accordance with criteria and procedures for designation prescribed in 
section 7(f) of the Act and this section of the regulations. The 
Administrator may decline to renew a designation if: (A) The requesting 
agency fails to meet or comply with any of the criteria for designation 
set forth in the Act, regulations, and instructions, of (B) the 
Administrator determines that another qualified applicant is better able 
to provide official services in the assigned area.
    (2) Automatic termination. Failure to pay the user fees prescribed 
by the Service for supervisory costs related to official inspection and 
weighing services within 30 days after due shall result in the automatic 
termination of the designation. The designation shall be reinstated if 
fees currently due, plus interest and any further expenses incurred by 
the Service because of the termination, are paid within 60 days after 
the termination.
    (3) Voluntary cancellation. An agency may request that its 
designation be canceled by giving 90 days written notice to the Service.
    (4) Suspension or revocation of designation. (i) General. A 
designation is subject to suspension or revocation, under section 
7(g)(3) of the Act, by the Service, whenever the Administrator 
determines that: (A) The agency has failed to meet one or more of the 
criteria specified in section 7(f) of the Act or the regulations for the 
performance of official functions, or otherwise has not complied with 
any provision of the Act, regulations, or instructions, or (B) has been 
convicted of any violation of other Federal law involving the handling 
or official inspection of grain.
    (ii) Summary suspension. The Service may, without first affording 
the agency (hereafter referred to in this paragraph as the 
``respondent'') an opportunity for a hearing, suspend a designation or 
refuse to reinstate a designation when the suspension period has 
expired, pending final determination of the proceeding whenever the 
Service has reason to believe there is cause for revocation of the 
designation and considers such action to be in the best interest of the 
official inspection and weighing system. A suspension or refusal to 
reinstate a suspended designation shall be effective upon the 
respondent's receipt of a notice from the Service. Within 30 calendar 
days following the issuance of a notice of such action, the Service 
shall afford the respondent an opportunity for a hearing under paragraph 
(h)(4)(iii) of this section. The Service may terminate the action if it 
finds that alternative managerial, staffing, financial, or operational 
arrangements satisfactory to the Service can be and are made by the 
respondent.
    (iii) Other than summary suspension. Except as provided in paragraph 
(h)(4)(ii) of the section, before the Service revokes or suspends a 
designation, the respondent shall be: (A) Notified by the Service of the 
proposed action and the reason(s) therefor, and (B) afforded an 
opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the Rules of Practice 
Governing Formal Adjudicatory Proceedings Instituted by the Secretary 
Under Various Statutes (7 CFR part 1, subpart H). Before initiating 
formal adjudicatory proceedings, the Service may, at its discretion, 
afford the respondent an opportunity to present its views on the 
proposed action and the reason(s) therefor in an informal conference. 
If, as a result of the informal conference, a consent agreement is 
reached, no formal adjudicatory proceedings shall be initiated.
    (i) Provision of services following suspension or termination. If 
the designation of an agency is suspended, terminated, or the renewal of 
a designation is not granted, the Service shall attempt, upon a finding 
of need, to arrange for a replacement agency. If a qualified replacement 
agency cannot be designated on a timely basis, a qualified agency, if 
available, shall be

[[Page 295]]

designated on an interim basis. If a qualified agency is not available 
on an interim basis, the Service shall provide needed services on an 
interim basis.

Sec. 810.101  Grains for which standards are established.

    Grain refers to barley, canola, corn, flaxseed, mixed grain, oats, 
rye, sorghum, soybeans, sunflower seed, triticale, and wheat. Standards 
for these food grains, feed grains, and oilseeds are established under 
the United States Grain Standards Act.

[57 FR 3274, Jan. 29, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 810.102  Definition of other terms.

    Unless otherwise stated, the definitions in this section apply to 
all grains. All other definitions unique to a particular grain are 
contained in the appropriate subpart for that grain.
    (a) Distinctly low quality. Grain that is obviously of inferior 
quality because it is in an unusual state or condition, and that cannot 
be graded properly by use of other grading factors provided in the 
standards. Distinctly low quality includes the presence of any objects 
too large to enter the sampling device; i.e., large stones, wreckage, or 
similar objects.
    (b) Moisture. Water content in grain as determined by an approved 
device according to procedures prescribed in FGIS instructions.
    (c) Stones. Concreted earthy or mineral matter and other substances 
of similar hardness that do not disintegrate in water.
    (d) Test weight per bushel. The weight per Winchester bushel 
(2,150.42 cubic inches) as determined using an approved device according 
to procedures prescribed in FGIS instructions. Test weight per bushel in 
the standards for corn, mixed grain, oats, sorghum, and soybeans is 
determined on the original sample. Test weight per bushel in the 
standards for barley, flaxseed, rye, sunflower seed, triticale, and 
wheat is determined after mechanically cleaning the original sample. 
Test weight per bushel is recorded to the nearest tenth pound for corn, 
rye, triticale, and wheat. Test weight per bushel for all other grains, 
if applicable, is recorded in whole and half pounds with a fraction of a 
half pound disregarded. Test weight per bushel is not an official factor 
for canola.
    (e) Whole kernels. Grain with \1/4\ or less of the kernel removed.

            Principles Governing the Application of Standards


<R05>
Sec. 810.103  Basis of determination.

    (a) Distinctly low quality. The determination of distinctly low 
quality is made on the basis of the lot as a whole at the time of 
sampling when a condition exists that may or may not appear in the 
representative sample and/or the sample as a whole.
    (b) Certain quality determinations. Each determination of rodent 
pellets, bird droppings, other animal filth, broken glass, castor beans, 
cockleburs, crotalaria seeds, dockage, garlic, live insect infestation, 
large stones, moisture, temperature, an unknown foreign substance(s), 
and a commonly recognized harmful or toxic substance(s) is made on the 
basis of the sample as a whole. When a condition exists that may not 
appear in the representative sample, the determination may be made on 
the basis of the lot as a whole at the time of sampling according to 
procedures prescribed in FGIS instructions.
    (c) All other determinations. The basis of determination for all 
other factors is contained in the individual standards.


<R05>
Sec. 810.104  Percentages.

    (a) Rounding. Percentages are determined on the basis of weight and 
are rounded as follows:
    (1) When the figure to be rounded is followed by a figure greater 
than or equal to 5, round to the next higher figure; e.g., report 6.36 
as 6.4, 0.35 as 0.4, and 2.45 as 2.5.
    (2) When the figure to be rounded is followed by a figure less than 
5, retain the figure; e.g., report 8.34 as 8.3, and 1.22 as 1.2.
    (b) Recording. The percentage of dockage in flaxseed and sorghum is 
reported in whole percent with fractions of a percent being disregarded. 
Dockage in barley and triticale is reported in whole and half percent 
with a fraction less than one-half percent being disregarded. Dockage in 
wheat and rye is reported in whole and tenth percents to the nearest 
tenth percent. Foreign material in sunflower seed is reported to the 
nearest one-half percent. Ranges of sunflower seed foreign material are 
reported as follows: 0.0 to 0.24 is reported as 0.0 percent, 0.25 to 
0.74 as 0.5 percent, 0.75 to 1.24 as 1.0 percent, and the like. Foreign 
material and fines in mixed grain is reported in whole percent. The 
percentage of smut in barley, sclerotinia and stones in canola, and 
ergot in all grains is reported to the nearest hundredth percent. The 
percentage when determining the identity of all grains is reported to 
the nearest whole percent. Also reported to the nearest whole percent

     Special Grades, Special Grade Requirements, and Special Grade 
                              Designations


<R05>
Sec. 810.107  Special grades and special grade requirements.

    A special grade serves to draw attention to a special factor or 
condition present in the grain and, when applicable, is supplemental to 
the grade assigned under Sec. 810.106. Except for the special grade 
``infested,'' the special grades are identified and requirements are 
established in each respective grain standards.
    (a) Infested wheat, rye, and triticale. Tolerances for live insects 
responsible for infested wheat, rye, and triticale are defined according 
to sampling designations as follows:
    (1) Representative sample. The representative sample consists of the 
work portion, and the file sample if needed and when available. These 
grains will be considered infested if the representative sample (other 
than shiplots) contains two or more live weevils, or one live weevil and 
one or more other live insects injurious to stored grain, or two or more 
live insects injurious to stored grain.
    (2) Lot as a whole (stationary). The lot as a whole is considered 
infested when two or more live weevils, or one live weevil and one or 
more other live insects injurious to stored grain, or two or more other 
live insects injurious to stored grain are found in, on, or about the 
lot (excluding submitted samples and shiplots).
    (3) Sample as a whole (continuous loading/unloading of shiplots and 
bargelots). The minimum sample size for bargelots and shiplots is 500 
grams per each 2,000 bushels of grain. The sample as a whole is 
considered infested when a component (as defined in FGIS instructions) 
contains two or more live weevils, or one live weevil and one or more 
other live insects injurious to stored grain, or two or more other live 
insects injurious to stored grain.
    (b) Infested barley, canola, corn, oats, sorghum, soybeans, 
sunflower seed, and mixed grain. Tolerances for live insects responsible 
for infested barley, canola,

[[Page 311]]

corn, oats, sorghum, soybeans, sunflower seed, and mixed grain are 
defined according to sampling designations as follows:
    (1) Representative sample. The representative sample consists of the 
work portion, and the file sample if needed and when available. These 
grains will be considered infested if the representative sample (other 
than shiplots) contains two or more live weevils, or one live weevil and 
five or more other live insects injurious to stored grain, or ten or 
more other live insects injurious to stored grain.
    (2) Lot as a whole (stationary). The lot as a whole is considered 
infested when two or more live weevils, or one live weevil and five or 
more other live insects injurious to stored grain, or ten or more other 
live insects injurious to stored grain are found in, on, or about the 
lot (excluding submitted samples and shiplots).
    (3) Sample as a whole (continuous loading/unloading of shiplots and 
bargelots). The minimum sample for shiplots and bargelots is 500 grams 
per each 2,000 bushels of grain. The sample as a whole is considered 
infested when a component (as defined in FGIS instructions) contains two 
or more live weevils, or one live weevil and five or more other live 
insects injurious to stored grain, or ten or more other live insects 
injurious to stored grain.

            Principles Governing the Application of Standards


<R05>
Sec. 810.203  Basis of determination.

    All other determinations. Each determination of heat-damaged 
kernels, injured-by-heat kernels, and white or blue aleurone layers in 
Six-rowed barley is made on pearled, dockage-free barley. Other 
determinations not specifically provided for under the General 
Provisions are made on the basis of the grain when free from dockage, 
except the determination of odor is made on either the basis of the 
grain as a whole or the grain when free from dockage.

oil free solid. Before the removal of dockage, the seed shall contain 
not more than 10.0% of other grains for which standards have been 
established under the United States Grain Standards Act.


<R05>
Sec. 810.302  Definitions of other terms.

    (a) Conspicuous Admixture. All matter other than canola, including 
but not limited to ergot, sclerotinia, and stones, which is conspicuous 
and readily distinguishable from canola and which remains in the sample 
after the removal of machine separated dockage. Conspicuous admixture is 
added to machine separated dockage in the computation of total dockage.
    (b) Damaged kernels. Canola and pieces of canola that are heat-
damaged, sprout-damaged, mold-damaged, distinctly green damaged, frost 
damaged, rimed damaged, or otherwise materially damaged.
    (c) Distinctly green kernels. Canola and pieces of canola which, 
after being crushed, exhibit a distinctly green color.
    (d) Dockage. All matter other than canola that can be removed from 
the original sample by use of an approved device according to procedures 
prescribed in FGIS instructions. Also, underdeveloped, shriveled, and 
small pieces of canola kernels that cannot be recovered by properly

[[Page 315]]

is added to conspicuous admixture in the computation of total dockage.
    (e) Ergot. Sclerotia (sclerotium, sing.) of the fungus, Claviceps 
species, which are associated with some seeds other than canola where 
the fungal organism has replaced the seed.
    (f) Heat-damaged kernels. Canola and pieces of canola which, after 
being crushed, exhibit that they are discolored and damaged by heat.
    (g) Inconspicuous admixture. Any seed which is difficult to 
distinguish from canola. This includes, but is not limited to, common 
wild mustard (Brassica kaber and B. juncea), domestic brown mustard 
(Brassica juncea), yellow mustard (B. hirta), and seed other than the 
mustard group.
    (h) Sclerotia (Sclerotium, sing.). Dark colored or black resting 
bodies of the fungi Sclerotinia and Claviceps.
    (i) Sclerotinia. Genus name which includes the fungus Sclerotinia 
sclerotiorum which produces sclerotia. Canola is only infrequently 
infected, and the sclerotia, unlike sclerotia of ergot, are usually 
associated within the stem of the plants.

Sec. 810.303  Basis of determination.

    Each determination of conspicuous admixture, ergot, sclerotinia, 
stones, damaged kernels, heat-damaged kernels, distinctly green kernels, 
and inconspicuous admixture is made on the basis of the sample when free 
from dockage. Other determinations not specifically provided for under 
the general provisions are made on the basis of the sample as a whole, 
except the determination of odor is made on either the basis of the 
sample as a whole or the sample when free from dockage. The content of 
glucosinolates and erucic acid is determined on the basis of the sample 
according to procedures prescribed in FGIS instructions.

                              Terms Defined


<R05>
Sec. 810.1601  Definition of soybeans.

    Grain that consists of 50 percent or more of whole or broken 
soybeans (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) that will not pass through an \8/64\ 
round-hole sieve and not more than 10.0 percent of other grains for 
which standards have been established under the United States Grain 
Standards Act.


<R05>
Sec. 810.1602  Definition of other terms.

    (a) Classes. There are two classes for soybeans: Yellow soybeans and 
Mixed soybeans.
    (1) Yellow soybeans. Soybeans that have yellow or green seed coats 
and which in cross section, are yellow or have a yellow tinge, and may 
include not more than 10.0 percent of soybeans of other colors.
    (2) Mixed soybeans. Soybeans that do not meet the requirements of 
the class Yellow soybeans.
    (b) Damaged kernels. Soybeans and pieces of soybeans that are badly 
ground-damaged, badly weather-damaged, diseased, frost-damaged, germ-
damaged, heat-damaged, insect-bored, mold-damaged, sprout-damaged, 
stinkbug-stung, or otherwise materially damaged. Stinkbug-stung kernels 
are considered damaged kernels at the rate of one-fourth of the actual 
percentage of the stung kernels.
    (c) Foreign material. All matter that passes through an \8/64\ 
round-hole sieve and all matter other than soybeans remaining in the 
sieved sample after sieving according to procedures prescribed in FGIS 
instructions.
    (d) Heat-damaged kernels. Soybeans and pieces of soybeans that are 
materially discolored and damaged by heat.
    (e) Purple mottled or stained. Soybeans that are discolored by the 
growth of a fungus; or by dirt; or by a dirt-like substance(s) including 
nontoxic inoculants; or by other nontoxic substances.
    (f) Sieve--\8/64\ round-hole sieve. A metal sieve 0.032 inch thick 
perforated with round holes 0.125 (\8/64\) inch in diameter.
    (g) Soybeans of other colors. Soybeans that have green, black, 
brown, or bicolored seed coats. Soybeans that have green seed coats will 
also be green in cross section. Bicolored soybeans will have seed coats 
of two colors, one of which is brown or black, and the brown or black 
color covers 50 percent of the seed coats. The hilum of a soybean is not 
considered a part of the seed coat for this determination.
    (h) Splits. Soybeans with more than \1/4\ of the bean removed and 
that are not damaged.

            Principles Governing the Application of Standards


<R05>
Sec. 810.1603  Basis of determination.

    Each determination of class, heat-damaged kernels, damaged kernels, 
splits, and soybeans of other colors is made on the basis of the grain 
when free from foreign material. Other determinations not specifically 
provided for under the general provisions are made on the basis of the 
grain as a whole.

                              Terms Defined


<R05>
Sec. 810.2201  Definition of wheat.

    Grain that, before the removal of dockage, consists of 50 percent or 
more common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), club wheat (T. compactum 
Host.), and durum wheat (T. durum Desf.) and not more than 10 percent of 
other grains for which standards have been established under the United 
States Grain Standards Act and that, after the removal of the dockage, 
contains 50 percent or more of whole kernels of one or more of these 
wheats.


<R05>
Sec. 810.2202  Definition of other terms.

    (a) Classes. There are eight classes for wheat: Durum wheat, Hard 
Red Spring wheat, Hard Red Winter wheat, Soft Red Winter wheat, Hard 
White wheat, Soft White wheat, Unclassed wheat, and Mixed wheat.

[[Page 330]]

    (1) Durum wheat. All varieties of white (amber) durum wheat. This 
class is divided into the following three subclasses:
    (i) Hard Amber Durum wheat. Durum wheat with 75 percent or more of 
hard and vitreous kernels of amber color.
    (ii) Amber Durum wheat. Durum wheat with 60 percent or more but less 
than 75 percent of hard and vitreous kernels of amber color.
    (iii) Durum wheat. Durum wheat with less than 60 percent of hard 
vitreous kernels of amber color.
    (2) Hard Red Spring wheat. All varieties of Hard Red Spring wheat. 
This class shall be divided into the following three subclasses.
    (i) Dark Northern Spring wheat. Hard Red Spring wheat with 75 
percent or more of dark, hard, and vitreous kernels.
    (ii) Northern Spring wheat. Hard Red Spring wheat with 25 percent or 
more but less than 75 percent of dark, hard, and vitreous kernels.
    (iii) Red Spring wheat. Hard Red Spring wheat with less than 25 
percent of dark, hard, and vitreous kernels.
    (3) Hard Red Winter wheat. All varieties of Hard Red Winter wheat. 
There are no subclasses in this class.
    (4) Soft Red Winter wheat. All varieties of Soft Red Winter wheat. 
There are no subclasses in this class.
    (5) Hard White wheat. All hard endosperm white wheat varieties. 
There are no subclasses in this class.
    (6) Soft White wheat. All soft endosperm white wheat varieties. This 
class is divided into the following three subclasses:
    (i) Soft White wheat. Soft endosperm white wheat varieties which 
contain not more than 10 percent of white club wheat.

percent of white club wheat and more than 10 percent of other soft white 
wheats.
    (7) Unclassed wheat. Any variety of wheat that is not classifiable 
under other criteria provided in the wheat standards. There are no 
subclasses in this class. This class includes any wheat which is other 
than red or white in color.
    (8) Mixed wheat. Any mixture of wheat that consists of less than 90 
percent of one class and more than 10 percent of one other class, or a 
combination of classes that meet the definition of wheat.

small pieces of wheat kernels removed in properly separating the 
material other than wheat and that cannot be recovered by properly 
rescreening or recleaning.
    (f) Foreign material. All matter other than wheat that remains in 
the sample after the removal of dockage and shrunken and broken kernels.
    (g) Heat-damaged kernels. Kernels, pieces of wheat kernels, and 
other grains that are materially discolored and damaged by heat which 
remain in

            Principles Governing the Application of Standards


<R05>
Sec. 810.2203  Basis of determination.

    Each determination of heat-damaged kernels, damaged kernels, foreign 
material, wheat of other classes, contrasting classes, and subclasses is 
made on the basis of the grain when free from dockage and shrunken and 
broken kernels. Other determinations not specifically provided for under 
the general provisions are made on the basis of the grain when free from 
dockage, except the determination of odor is made on either the basis of 
the grain as a whole or the grain when free from dockage.

<R05>
Sec. 868.101  General information.

    The Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) 
of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) facilitates the fair and 
efficient marketing of agricultural products by maintaining voluntary 
grade standards for Beans, Whole Dry Peas, Split Peas, and Lentils, 
which provide a uniform language for describing the quality of these 
commodities in the

[[Page 354]]

marketplace. These standards may cover (but are not limited to) terms, 
classes, quality levels, performance criteria, and inspection 
requirements. Procedures contained in this part set forth the process 
which GIPSA will follow in developing, issuing, revising, suspending, or 
terminating the U.S. standards for Beans, Whole Dry Peas, Split Peas, 
and Lentils. Communications about GIPSA standards in general should be 
addressed to the Administrator, GIPSA, USDA, 1400 Independence Avenue, 
S.W., Washington, D.C. 20250-3601.


<R05>
Sec. 868.102  Procedures for establishing and revising grade standards.

    (a) GIPSA will develop, revise, suspend, or terminate grade 
standards if it determines that such action is in the public interest. 
GIPSA encourages interested parties to participate in the review, 
development, and revision of grade standards. Interested parties include 
growers, producers, processors, shippers, distributors, consumers, trade 
associations, companies, and State or Federal agencies. Such persons may 
at any time recommend that GIPSA develop, revise, suspend, or terminate 
a grade standard. Requests for action should be in writing, and should 
be accompanied by a draft of the suggested change, as appropriate.
    (b) GIPSA will:
    (1) Determine the need for new or revised standards;
    (2) Collect technical, marketing, or other appropriate data;
    (3) Conduct research regarding new or revised standards, as 
appropriate; and
    (4) Draft the proposed standards.
    (c) If GIPSA determines that new standards are needed, existing 
standards need to be revised, or the suspension or termination of 
existing standards is justified, GIPSA will undertake the action with 
input from interested parties.


<R05>
Sec. 868.103  Public notification of grade standards action.

    (a) After developing a standardization proposal, GIPSA will publish 
a notice in the Federal Register proposing new or revised standards or 
suspending or terminating existing standards. The notice will provide a 
sufficient comment period for interested parties to submit comments.
    (b) GIPSA will simultaneously issue a news release about these 
actions, notifying the affected industry and general public. GIPSA will 
also distribute copies of proposals to anyone requesting a copy or to 
anyone it believes may be interested, including other Federal, State, or 
local government agencies.
    (c) All comments received within the comment period will be made 
part of the public record maintained by GIPSA, will be available to the 
public for review, and will be considered by GIPSA before final action 
is taken on the proposal.
    (d) Based on the comments received, GIPSA's knowledge of standards, 
grading, marketing, and other technical factors, and any other relevant 
information, GIPSA will decide whether the proposed actions should be 
implemented.
    (e) If GIPSA concludes that the changes as proposed or with 
appropriate modifications should be adopted, GIPSA will publish the 
final changes in the Federal Register as a final notice. GIPSA will make 
the grade standards and related information available in printed form 
and electronic media.
    (f) If GIPSA determines that proposed changes are not warranted, or 
otherwise are not in the public interest, GIPSA will either publish in 
the Federal Register a notice withdrawing the proposal, or will revise 
the proposal and again seek public input.

              Principles Governing Application of Standards


<R05>
Sec. 868.203  Basis of determination.

    The determination of seeds, objectionable seeds, heat-damaged 
kernels, red rice and damaged kernels, chalky kernels, other types, 
color, and the special grade Parboiled rough rice shall be on the basis 
of the whole and large broken kernels of milled rice that are produced 
in the milling of rough rice to a well-milled degree. When determining 
class, the percentage of (a) whole kernels of rough rice shall be 
determined on the basis of the original sample, and (b) types of rice 
shall be determined on the basis of the whole and large broken kernels 
of milled rice that are produced in the milling of rough rice to a well-
milled degree. Smutty kernels shall be determined on the basis of the 
rough rice after it has been cleaned and shelled as prescribed in FGIS 
instructions, or by any method that is approved by the Administrator as 
giving equivalent results. All other determinations shall be on the 
basis of the original sample. Mechanical sizing of kernels shall be 
adjusted by handpicking as prescribed in FGIS instructions, or by any 
method that is approved by the Administrator as giving equivalent 
results.

     Special Grades, Special Grade Requirements, and Special Grade 
                              Designations


<R05>
Sec. 868.212  Special grades and requirements.

    A special grade, when applicable, is supplemental to the grade 
assigned under Sec. 868.210. Such special grades for rough rice are 
established and determined as follows:
    (a) Infested rough rice. Tolerances for live insects for infested 
rough rice are defined according to sampling designations as follows:
    (1) Representative sample. The representative sample consists of the 
work portion, and the file sample if needed and when available. The 
rough rice (except when examined according to paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section will be considered infested if the representative sample 
contains two or more live weevils, or one live weevil and one or more 
other live insects injurious to stored rice or five or more other live 
insects injurious to stored rice.
    (2) Lot as a whole (stationary). The lot as a whole is considered 
infested when two or more live weevils, or one live weevil and one or 
more other live insects injurious to stored rice, or five or more other 
live insects injurious to stored rice, or 15 or more live Angoumois 
moths or other live moths injurious to stored rice are found in, on, or

Sec. 868.308  Percentages.

    (a) Rounding. Percentages are determined on the basis of weight and 
are rounded as follows:
    (1) When the figure to be rounded is followed by a figure greater 
than or equal to 5, round to the next higher figure; e.g., report 6.36 
as 6.4, 0.35 as 0.4, and 2.45 as 2.5.
    (2) When the figure to be rounded is followed by a figure less than 
5, retain the figure, e.g., report 8.34 as 8.3 and 1.22 and 1.2.
    (b) Recording. The percentage of broken kernels removed by a 5 plate 
in U.S. Nos. 1 and 2 Milled Rice and the percentage of objectionable 
seeds in U.S. No. 1 Brewers Milled Rice is reported to the nearest 
hundredth percent. The percentages of all other factors are recorded to 
the nearest tenth of a percent.

     Special Grades, Special Grade Requirements, and Special Grade 
                              Designations


<R05>
Sec. 868.315  Special grades and special grade requirements.

    A special grade, when applicable, is supplemental to the grade 
assigned under Sec. 868.314. Such special grades for milled rice are 
established and determined as follows:
    (a) Coated Milled Rice. Coated milled rice shall be rice which is 
coated, in whole or in part, with substances that are safe and suitable 
as defined in the regulation issued pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act at 21 CFR 130.3(d).
    (b) Granulated brewers milled rice. Granulated brewers milled rice 
shall be milled rice which has been crushed or granulated so that 95.0 
percent or more will pass through a 5 sieve, 70.0 percent or more will 
pass through a 4 sieve, and not more than 15.0 percent will pass through 
a 2\1/2\ sieve.
    (c) Parboiled milled rice. Parboiled milled rice shall be milled 
rice in which the starch has been gelatinized by soaking, steaming, and 
drying. Grades U.S. No. 1 to U.S. No. 6, inclusive, shall contain not 
more than 10.0 percent of ungelatinized kernels. Grades U.S. No. 1 and 
U.S. No. 2 shall contain not more than 0.1 percent, grades U.S. No. 3 
and U.S. No. 4 not more than 0.2 percent, and grades U.S. No. 5 and U.S. 
No. 6 not more than 0.5 percent of nonparboiled rice. If the rice is: 
(1) Not distinctly colored by the parboiling process, it shall be 
considered ``Parboiled Light''; (2) distinctly but not materially 
colored by the parboiling process, it shall be considered ``Parboiled''; 
(3) materially colored by the parboiling process, it shall be considered 
``Parboiled Dark.'' The color levels for ``Parboiled Light,'' 
``Parboiled,'' and ``Parboiled Dark'' shall be in accordance with the 
interpretive line samples for parboiled rice.
    Note: The maximum limits for ``Chalky kernels,'' ``Heat-damaged 
kernels,'' ``Kernels damaged by heat,'' and the ``Color requirements'' 
in Sec. Sec. 868.310, 868.311, 868.312, and 868.313 are not applicable 
to the special grade ``Parboiled milled rice.''
    (d) Undermilled milled rice. Undermilled milled rice shall be milled 
rice which is not equal to the milling requirements for ``hard milled,'' 
``well milled,'' and ``reasonably well milled'' rice (see Sec. 
868.306). Grades U.S. No. 1 and U.S. No. 2 shall contain not more than 
2.0 percent, grades U.S. No. 3 and U.S. No. 4 not more than 5.0 percent, 
grade U.S. No. 5 not more than 10.0 percent, and grade U.S. No. 6 not 
more than 15.0 percent of well-milled kernels. Grade U.S. No. 5 shall 
contain not more than 10.0 percent of red rice and damaged kernels 
(singly or combined) and in no case more than 6.0 percent of damaged 
kernels.
    (e) Glutinous milled rice. Glutinous milled rice shall be special 
varieties of rice (Oryza sativa L. glutinosa) which contain more than 50 
percent chalky kernels. For long grain, medium grain, and short grain 
milled rice, grade U.S. No. 1 shall contain not more than 1.0 percent of 
nonchalky kernels, grade U.S. No. 2 not more than 2.0 percent of 
nonchalky kernels, grade U.S. No. 3 not more than 4.0 percent of 
nonchalky kernels, grade U.S. No. 4 not more than 6.0 percent of 
nonchalky kernels, grade U.S. No. 5 not more than 10.0 percent of 
nonchalky kernels, and grade U.S. No. 6 not more than 15.0 percent of 
nonchalky kernels. For second head milled rice, grade U.S. No. 1 shall 
contain not more than 4.0 percent of nonchalky

[[Page 372]]

kernels, grade U.S. No. 2 not more than 6.0 percent of nonchalky 
kernels, grade U.S. No. 3 not more than 10.0 percent of nonchalky 
kernels, grade U.S. No. 4 not more than 15.0 percent of nonchalky 
kernels, and grade U.S. No. 5 not more than 20.0 percent of nonchalky 
kernels. For screenings milled rice, there are no grade limits for 
percent of nonchalky kernels. For brewers milled rice, the special grade 
``Glutinous milled rice'' is not applicable.
    Note: The maximum limits for ``Chalky kernels,'' shown in Sec. Sec. 
868.310, 868.311, and 868.312 are not applicable to the special grade 
``Glutinous milled rice.''
    (f) Aromatic milled rice. Aromatic milled rice shall be special 
varieties of rice (Oryza sativa L. scented) that have a distinctive and 
characteristic aroma; e.g., basmati and jasmine rice.
