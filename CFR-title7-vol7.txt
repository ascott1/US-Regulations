                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2003), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

                           Subpart A--General


<R05>
Sec. 700.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The purpose of this part is for the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture (USDA), with certain concurrences by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA), to set forth regulations to carry out an 
experimental Rural Clean Water Program (RCWP) as authorized by the 
Agriculture, Rural Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 
fiscal year 1980, Pub. L. 96-108 (hereinafter referred to as the ``1980 
Appropriations Act'') and subsequent appropriations.
    (b) The RCWP will provide financial and technical assistance to 
private land owners and operators (participants) having control of 
agricultural land. The assistance is provided through long-term 
contracts of 3 to 10 years to install best management practices (BMPs) 
in approved project areas which have critical water quality problems 
resulting from agricultural activities. The project area must reflect 
the water quality priority concerns developed through the established 
water quality management program process. Participation RCWP is 
voluntary.
    (c) This is a new USDA program using the experiences under various 
on-going USDA programs and the established water quality management 
program of EPA.

[45 FR 14009, Mar. 4, 1980, as amended at 46 FR 29454, June 2, 1981]


<R05>
Sec. 700.2  Objective.

    The objectives of the RCWP are to:
    (a) Improve impaired water use and quality in the approved project 
area in the most cost-effective manner possible in keeping with the 
provision of adequate supplies of food, fiber, and a quality 
environment.
    (b) Assist agricultural land owners and operators to reduce 
agricultural nonpoint source water pollutants and to improve water 
quality in rural areas to meet water quality standards or water quality 
goals.
    (c) Develop and test programs, policies and procedures for the 
control of agricultural nonpoint source pollution.

[45 FR 14009, Mar. 4, 1980, as amended at 46 FR 29454, June 2, 1981]

[[Page 8]]


<R05>
Sec. 700.3  Administration.

    At the national level, the Secretary of Agriculture will administer 
the RCWP in consultation with the Administrator, EPA, including EPA's 
concurrence in the selection of the BMPs, as provided in the 1980 
Appropriations Act and subsequent appropriations. Authority to approve 
projects is reserved to the Secretary. The Secretary of Agriculture 
hereby delegates responsibility for administration of the program to the 
Administrator, Farm Service Agency (FSA) and the coordination of 
technical assistance to the Chief, Soil Conservation Service (SCS). FSA 
will be assisted by other USDA agencies in accordance with existing 
authorities.
    (a) A National Rural Clean Water Coordinating Committee (NCC), 
chaired by the Administrator, FSA, will assist in carrying out the RCWP.
    (b) A State Rural Clean Water Coordinating Committee (SCC) will 
assist the State ASC Committee in administering the program. The State 
ASC Committee Chairperson will chair the SCC. Where two or more States 
are involved in a project area the Deputy Administrator, State and 
County Operations (DASCO), FSA, shall develop a coordinating process.
    (c) A Local Rural Clean Water Coordinating Committee (LCC) will be 
established to assure coordination at the project level. The LCC 
committee will be chaired by the County ASC Committee Chairperson and 
will assist the County ASC Committee as provided in these regulations 
and as otherwise developed by the SCC and the LCC. Where two or more 
counties are involved in a project area, the SCC shall develop a 
coordination process.

[45 FR 14009, Mar. 4, 1980, as amended at 46 FR 29454, June 2, 1981 59 
FR 60299, Nov. 23, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 700.4  Definitions.

    (a) Adequate Level of Participation. An adequate level of 
participation is reached when participants having control of 75 percent 
(unless a different level is approved by the Administrator, FSA, with 
the concurrence of the NCC), of the identified critical area(s) or

<R05>
Sec. 700.26  Contract modifications.

    (a) The County ASC Committee by mutual agreement with the landowner 
or operator, may modify contracts previously entered into if it is 
determined to be desirable to carry out the purposes of the program, 
facilitate the practical administration thereof, or to accomplish 
equitable treatment with respect to other conservation, land-use, and/or 
water quality programs.
    (b) Requirements of active contracts may be modified by the County 
ASC Committee only if such modifications are specifically provided for 
in these regulations. The concurrence of SCS or its designee and the CD 
are necessary when modifications involve a technical aspect of the 
participant's water quality plan. A contract may be modified only if it 
is determined that such modifications are desirable to carry out 
purposes of the program or to facilitate the program's practical 
administration.

[[Page 18]]

    (c) Contracts may be modified when the participants add or delete 
land to the farm.
    (d) Contracts may be modified to add, delete, or substitute BMPs 
when:
    (1) The installed measure failed to achieve the desired results 
through no fault of the participant.
    (2) The installed measure deteriorated because of conditions beyond 
the control of the participant.
    (3) Another BMP will achieve the desired results.
    (4) The extent of the BMP is changed.
    (e) Contract modifications are not required when items of work are 
accomplished prior to scheduled completion or within 1 year following 
the year of scheduled completion. Other time schedule revisions will 
require modification.
    (f) If, during the contract period, all or part of the right and 
interest in the land is transferred by sale or other transfer action, 
the contract is terminated on that portion of the contract, the 
participant:
    (1) Forfeits all right to any future cost-share payments on the 
transferred portion.
    (2) Must refund all cost-share payments that have been made on the 
transferred land unit unless the new land owner or operator becomes a 
party to the contract, except the payment may be retained where it is 
determined by the County ASC Committee after consultation with the 
technical agency and the CD, that the established BMPs will provide 
water quality benefits for the designed life of the BMP.
    (g) If the new land owner or operator becomes a party to the 
contract:
    (1) Payment which has been earned, may be made to the participant 
who applied the BMPs and had control prior to the transfer.
    (2) The new land owner or operator is to assume all obligations of 
the previous participant with respect to the transferred land.
    (3) The contract with the new participant is to remain in effect 
with the original terms and conditions, except that;
    (4) The original contract is to be modified in writing to show the 
changes caused by the transfer. If the modification is not acceptable to 
the County ASC Committee, the provisions of paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of 
this section apply.


<R05>
Sec. 700.27  Cost-share payment.

    (a) General. Participants are to obtain or contract for materials or 
services as needed to install BMPs. Federal cost-share payments are to 
be made by the County ASC Committee upon certification by the District 
Conservationist, SCS, or designee, that the BMPs, or an identifiable 
unit thereof, have been properly carried out and meet the appropriate 
standards and specifications.
    (b) Payment maximum. The maximum RCWP cost-share payment to a 
participant shall be limited to $50,000.
    (c) Basis for cost-share payment. (1) Cost-share payments are to be 
made by the County ASC Committee at the cost-share percentage specified 
in the project approval notice and by one of the following methods as 
set out in the contract:
    (i) Average cost; or
    (ii) Actual cost but not to exceed the average cost.
    (2) If the average cost at the time of starting the installation of 
a BMP or identifiable unit is less than the costs specified in the 
contract, payment is to be at the lower rate. If the costs at the start 
of installation are higher, payment may be made at the higher rate. A 
modification will be necessary if the higher cost results in a 
significant increase in the total cost-share obligation. Cost-share 
payment is not to be made until the modification reflecting the increase 
is approved.
    (d) Average cost development. Average costs are to be developed by 
the County ASC Committee for each project using cost data from the local 
area. These costs shall be reviewed by the SCC for consistency with 
average costs in other USDA programs. These average costs shall be 
updated annually by the County ASC Committee in consultation with the 
LCC.
    (e) Application for payment. Cost-share payments shall be made by 
the County ASC Committee after a participant has completed a BMP or an 
identifiable unit of a BMP and it is determined to

[[Page 19]]

meet standards and specifications. Application for payment must be 
submitted to the County ASC Committee, on the prescribed form and be 
supported by such cost receipts as are required by the County ASC 
Committee. It is the participant's responsibility to apply for payments.
    (f) Authorizations for payments to suppliers. (1) The contract may 
authorize that part or all of the Federal cost share for a BMP or an 
identifiable unit be made directly to suppliers of materials or 
services. The materials or services must be delivered or performed 
before payment is made.
    (2) Federal cost shares will not be in excess of the cost share 
attributable to the material or service used or not in excess of the 
cost share for all identifiable units as may be requested by the 
participant.
    (g) Material inspection and analysis. When authorizations for 
payments to suppliers are specified, the County ASC Committee, its 
representatives, or the Federal Government reserve the right to inspect, 
sample, and analyze materials or services prior to their use.
    (h) Assignments, set-offs, and claims. (1) Any person who may be 
entitled to any cost-share may assign rights thereto in accordance with 
regulations governing the assignments of payments. (31 U.S.C. 203, as 
amended, and 41 U.S.C. 15, as amended.)
    (2) If any participant to whom compensation is payable under RCWP is 
indebted to the United States and such indebtedness is listed on the 
county register of indebtedness maintained by the County ASC Committee, 
the compensation due the participant must be used (set-off) to reduce 
that indebtedness. Indebtedness to USDA is to be given first 
consideration. Setoffs made pursuant to this section are not to deprive 
the participant of any right to contest the justness of the indebtedness 
involved. (See 7 CFR part 13.)
    (3) Any cost-share payment due any participant shall be allowed 
without deduction of claims for advances except as provided for above 
and without regard to any claim or lien against any crop, or proceeds 
thereof, in favor of the participant or any other creditor.
    (i) Access to land unit and records. The County ASC Committee, the 
agency providing technical assistance or representatives thereof, shall 
have the right of access at reasonable times to land under application 
or contract, and the right to examine any program records to ascertain 
the accuracy of any representations made in the applications or 
contract.
    (j) Suspension of payments. No cost-share payments will be made 
pending a decision on whether or not a contract violation has occurred.
    (k) Ineligible payments. The filing of requests for payment for BMPs 
not carried out, or for BMPs carried out in such a manner that they do 
not meet the contract specifications, constitutes a violation of the 
contract.


<R05>
Sec. 700.28  Appeals.

    (a) The applicant may, prior to execution of the contract, request 
that the County ASC Committee review or reconsider administrative 
criteria being used in developing his or her contract.
    (1) The applicant shall make a written request to the County ASC 
Committee setting forth the basis for the appeal.
    (2) The County ASC Committee shall have 30 days in which to make a 
decision and notify the applicant in writing.

    (b) The applicant/participant may request and receive a review by 
the SCS State Conservationist of criteria used in developing the water 
quality plan or BMP specifications.
    (c) After the contract has been executed, the participant may 
request and receive a review of administrative procedures under the FSA 
appeals procedures set out in 7 CFR part 780.


<R05>
Sec. 700.29  Contract violations.

contract by a participant:
    (1) Knowingly or negligently damaging or causing BMPs to become 
impaired.
    (2) Failing to comply with the terms of the contract.
    (3) Filing a false claim.

[[Page 20]]

    (4) Misusing conservation materials or services.
    (5) Adopting a land use or practice during the contract period which 
tends to defeat the purposes of the program.
    (b) Contract termination as a result of violations. (1) The 
participant agrees to forfeit all rights to further cost-sharing 
payments under a contract and to refund all cost-share payments received 
if the County ASC Committee with the concurrence of the State ASC 
Committee, determines that:
    (i) There was a violation of the contract during the time the 
participant had control of the land.
    (ii) The violation was of such a nature as to warrant termination of 
the contract.
    (2) The participant shall be obligated to refund all cost-share 
payments, including those paid to vendors for materials and services.
    (c) Payment adjustments and refunds resulting from violations. (1) 
The participant agrees to refund cost-share payments received under the 
contract or to accept payment adjustments if the County ASC Committee 
determines and the State ASC Committee concurs that:
    (i) There was a violation of the contract during the time the 
participant had control of the land.
    (ii) The nature of the violation does not warrant termination of the 
contract.
    (2) Payment adjustments may include decreasing the rate of the cost 
share, or deleting from the contract a cost-share commitment, or 
withholding cost-share payments earned but not paid. The participant who 
signs the contract may be obligated to refund cost-share payments.

by the Secretary or designee.

[45 FR 49522, July 25, 1980, as amended at 47 FR 46999, Oct. 22, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 701.12  Selection of practices.

    The practices to be included in the State or county program shall be 
only those practices for which cost-sharing is essential to permit 
accomplishment of the program objective.


<R05>
Sec. 701.13  Levels and rates of cost-sharing.

    (a) The maximum level of cost-sharing for each practice shall be the

the cost of performing the practice.
    (b) Levels of cost-sharing under annual agreements for each practice 
shall not be in excess of 75 percent of the average cost of carrying out 
the practice as determined by the county committee. However, where the 
Deputy Administrator, State and County Operations, determines a higher 
level of cost-sharing is necessary to provide adequate incentive for 
producer to carry out a conservation practice, the Deputy Administrator, 
State and County Operations, may specifically authorize a higher level. 
(See Sec. 701.19 for special provision for low-income farmers.)
    (c) Levels of cost-sharing under long term agreements shall not be 
in excess of 75 percent nor less than 50 percent of the average cost for

<R05>
Sec. 701.14  Starting of practices.

    Costs will not be shared for practices or components of practices 
that are started before a formal approval is given by the county 
committee.

[47 FR 939, Jan. 8, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 701.15  Method of approval.

    The county committee will determine the extent to which Federal 
funds will be made available to share the cost of each approved 
practice, taking into consideration the county allocation, the 
conservation and environmental problems in the county, the land 
involved, and the practices for

[[Page 27]]

which requested cost-sharing is considered by the county committee as 
most needed. The method approved shall provide for the issuance of 
notices of approval showing for each approved practice the number of 
units of the practice for which the Federal Government will share in the 
cost and the amount of the cost-share for the performance of that number 
of units of the practice. To the extent practicable, notices of approved 
practices shall be issued before performance of the practice is started. 
No practice may be approved for cost-sharing except as authorized by the 
county program, or in accordance with procedures incorporated therein. 
Available funds for cost-sharing shall not be allocated on a pro-rata 
basis, but shall be directed to the accomplishment of the most enduring 
benefits attainable.
    (a) Cost-sharing may be approved under annual agreements or long-
term agreements.
    (b) Annual agreements may be approved in all counties. Long-term 
agreements are limited to farms or ranches which are within Soil 
Conservation Districts (or comparable districts) through which the Soil 
Conservation Service provides planning and technical services, except:
    (1) Farms and ranches located within a county designated for the 
Great Plains Conservation Program are only eligible for long-term 
agreements that cover part of a farm. Long-term agreements that cover 
whole farms shall not be approved in these counties.
    (2) Farms and ranches not located within a Soil Conservation 
District (or comparable district) may be eligible for a long-term 
agreement, provided conservation plans of operations are developed by 
the farmer or rancher in cooperation with the Soil Conservation Service 
and approved by an appropriate State official or, in cases where an 
appropriate State official is not available, approved by the Soil 
Conservation Service.


<R05>
Sec. 701.16  Long-term agreements.

    (a) The period of a long-term agreement will be for not less than 
three (3) program years nor more than ten (10) program years. The county 
committee and the signatories to the agreement in consultation with the 
Soil Conservation Service representative, will mutually determine the 
period of the agreement.
    (b) The long-term agreement will be based on a conservation plan of 
operations for the farm or ranch or portion thereof which has been 
approved by the Soil Conservation District (or comparable district) or, 
for farms or ranches not located in a Soil Conservation District (or 
comparable district), by an appropriate State Official or the Soil 
Conservation Service, as applicable.
    (c) The long-term agreement will provide that the farmer or rancher 
will carry out those measures in the conservation plan of operations 
which are determined to be essential to meeting the basic conservation 
needs of the farm or ranch, or portion thereof, whether or not cost-
sharing is approved for such measures.
    (d) The owner of the farm or ranch will be required to be a 
signatory to a long-term agreement, whether or not that person 
contributes to the cost of approved practices thereon.
    (e) Any signatory to a long-term agreement who is not an owner of 
the farm or ranch must provide assurance of control of the land for the 
duration of the period of the agreement.
    (f) The level of cost-sharing, as provided in Sec. 701.13, in effect 
for practices in all years of a long-term agreement shall be the level 
in effect for the beginning year of the agreement. The rate of cost-
sharing for payment purposes for such practice will be based on the 
average cost of performing the practice at the time the practice is 
performed.
    (g) A long-term agreement may be cancelled for failure to comply 
with the terms of the agreement if, after consulting with the Soil 
Conservation District (or comparable district) board or, if none exists, 
with a representative of the Soil Conservation Service, the county 
committee and State committee find that the seriousness of the 
irregularities warrant such action. If the agreement is cancelled, the 
signatories to the agreement are jointly and severally responsible for 
refunding all cost-shares paid and will forfeit all rights to further 
payments under the

[[Page 28]]

agreement. In such a case, no other refund or forfeiture provisions of 
these regulations apply.
    (h) A long-term agreement may be revised in accordance with 
instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator, State and County 
Operations, by mutual agreement between the signatories to the agreement 
and the county committee based on approved changes in the Conservation 
plan of operations for the farm or ranch.
    (i) An eligible person who acquires control of land under an 
approved agreement may elect to become a successor in interest under 
such agreement.
    (j) An agreement will be terminated with respect to land for which 
loss of control has occurred and where the person acquiring control of 
such land elects not to become a successor in interest under the 
agreement. If the loss of control is for reasons beyond the control of 
the signatories to the agreement, the county committee will determine 
whether or not any cost-shares previously paid shall be refunded, but in 
no event shall the refund be greater than would be required in cases 
where loss of control is voluntary. If the loss of control is voluntary 
on the part of the signatories to the agreement, the signatories will be 
jointly and severally responsible for refunding all cost-shares paid and 
will forfeit all rights to further payments, with respect to the land 
for which control is lost. However, a refund will not be required for 
cost-shares where, the county committee and the State committee 
determine, after consulting with a representative of the Soil 
Conservation Service, that failure to perform the remaining practices in 
the agreement will not impair the effectiveness of the practices which 
have been performed and that the completed practices have provided 
conservation benefits consistent with the cost-shares which have been 
paid.
    (k) An agreement may be terminated by the county committee, after 
considering the recommendation of the Soil Conservation District (or 
comparable district) board or, if none exists, with a representative of 
the Soil Conservation Service, if such action is in the public interest. 
The county committee will determine the amount of cost-shares previously 
paid that shall be refunded.
    (l) An agreement may be terminated by the county committee upon the 
written request of the participant(s) to an agreement where no cost-
shares have been paid for any of the scheduled practices and where the 
participant(s) does(do) not intend to perform any of the scheduled 
practices.


<R05>
Sec. 701.17  Replacement, enlargement, or restoration.

    The establishment or installation of a practice, for the purposes of 
the program shall be deemed to include the replacement, enlargement, or 
restoration of a practice for which cost-sharing has been allowed if the 
practice has served for its normal lifespan, or if all of the following 
conditions exist:
    (a) Replacement, enlargement, or restoration of the practice is 
needed to solve the problem.
    (b) The failure of the original practice was not due to the lack of 
proper maintenance by the current operator.
    (c) The county committee believes that the replacement, enlargement 
or restoration of the practice merits consideration under the program to 
an equal extent with other practices.


<R05>
Sec. 701.18  Pooling agreements.

    Farmers, ranchers, or eligible landowners in any local area may 
agree in writing, with the approval of the county committee, to perform 
designated practices which, by conserving or improving resources of the 
community, will solve a mutual conservation, pollution, or other 
environmental problem on the land of the participants. For purposes of 
eligibility for cost-sharing, practices carried out under such an 
approved written agreement shall be regarded as having been carried out 
on the land of the persons who performed the practices.


<R05>
Sec. 701.19  Special provisions for low-income farmers and ranchers.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 701.13(c), the county 
committee may approve, in the case of low-income farmers and ranchers as 
defined in this section, level of cost-sharing of up to 80 percent of 
the average cost of performing practices.

[[Page 29]]

    (b) A low-income farmer or rancher is one who, as determined by the 
county committee, is a small producer whose livelihood is largely 
dependent on the farm or ranch and whose prospective income and 
financial resources for the current year are such that the farmer or 
rancher could not reasonably be expected to perform needed conservation 
practices at levels of cost-sharing applicable to other persons in the 
county.
    (c) In approving requests for cost-sharing the county committee 
shall give special consideration to requests filed by low-income farmers 
and ranchers.

<R05>
Sec. 701.20  Encumbering land.

    In order to receive cost-share assistance for a conservation 
practice in a Salinity Control Project area, a person participating in 
the program shall agree, as a condition of eligibility to receive such 
assistance, that a recordable encumbrance may be filed by FSA with 
respect to the land on which the conservation practice is installed. 
Such encumbrance shall reflect the amount of the cost-share assistance 
which is received by the program participant for the practice and shall 
continue until such time as the established lifespan for the practice 
has expired. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this requirement may be 
waived by the county committee if such committee determines, with the 
concurrence of the State committee and after consultation with 
appropriate Federal, State and local authorities, that the land will not 
likely be converted to a nonagricultural use within the next five years.

<R05>
Sec. 701.27  Program objective.

    The objective of the Forestry Incentives Program (hereinafter 
referred to in this subpart as the ``program'') is to help assure a 
future supply of timber. This will be accomplished by encouraging 
landowners to apply forestry practices for the following:
    (a) Production of softwood and hardwood timber and other forest-
resources associated therewith to increase afforestation of suitable 
open lands.
    (b) Reforestation of cutover and understocked forest lands.
    (c) Timber stand improvement.
    (d) Intensive multipurpose management.
    (e) Protection of forest resources.

<R05>
Sec. 701.29  Designated counties.

    The State committee in consultation with the State Forester, will 
designate the counties or parts of counties in which the program will be 
operated. The following will be considered in making the selections:
    (a) The total acreage in the county devoted to desirable types of 
softwood and hardwood timber.
    (b) The estimated area in the county that is under eligible 
ownership.
    (c) The estimated acreage suitable for the production of forest 
products.
    (d) The availability of funds.
    (e) The enhancement of other forest resources.


<R05>
Sec. 701.30  Eligible person, land, and ownerships.

    (a) An eligible person is a private individual, group, Indian Tribe 
or other native group, association, corporation excluding corporations 
whose stocks are publicly traded, or other legal entity which owns 
eligible land. Firms principally engaged in the manufacture of wood 
products are not eligible. However, forest landowners who manufacture 
forest products on a part-time or irregular basis, are eligible.
    (b) Eligible land is ``nonindustrial'' private forest land capable 
of producing at least 50 cubic feet of wood per acre per year.
    (c) Eligible farms are those not exceeding a total of 1,000 acres of 
eligible private nonindustrial forest land in the United States or any 
commonwealth, territory or possession of the United States. The State 
Committee with the concurrence of the State Forester may approve cost-
sharing with landowners owning more than 1,000 but not more than 5,000 
acres of eligible forest land where it is deemed to be to the public's 
significant benefit.
    (d) Significant public benefits are primarily those resulting from 
cost-effective timber production, with related benefits to aesthetics, 
recreation, other resource values, watershed protection and erosion 
reduction.


<R05>
Sec. 701.31  Program funds.

    (a) State and counties. Each designated State and county will 
receive a share of the funds provided nationally for the program. Funds 
will be distributed on the basis of the forest production opportunities 
in each State, considering the acreage of private nonindustrial forest 
lands, the number of eligible owners, the potential productivity of such 
lands and the need for reforestation, timber stand improvement, other 
forestry management needs, and the enhancement of other forest 
resources. The Director, Conservation and Environmental Protection 
Division, FSA, will allocate funds after consultation with 
representatives of the U.S. Forest Service and a committee of not less 
than five State foresters or equivalent State officials selected by a 
majority of the State foresters or equivalent State officials. The State 
committee will consult with the State forester when determining the 
allocation of such funds to the designated counties.
    (b) A limitation on the amount of funds which may be obligated under 
long-term agreements shall be established by the State committee in 
accordance with guidelines provided by the Deputy Administrator, State 
and County Operations.


<R05>
Sec. 701.32  Eligible practices and cost-share requirements.

    (a) Cost-sharing may be available for the following National 
practices and authority:
    (1) Practice FP1. Planting Trees.
    (2) Practice FP2. Improving a Stand of Forest Trees.
    (3) Practice authority--SF Practice. Special Forestry Practices. The 
Director, Conservation and Environmental Protection Division, FSA, after 
consultation with the Forest Service, may approve special forestry 
practices needed to solve a significant and unique local condition for 
which the National practices are not adequate. Such practices may be 
approved for inclusion in a county program after consultation with the 
program development group, and the recommendation of the county 
committee, the service forester, the State committee and the State 
forester.
    (b) A forest management plan is required as a condition of cost-
sharing.

[[Page 31]]

The plan will be developed in consultation with the landowner, approved 
by the service forester, and will contain information for accurate 
evaluation of practice effectiveness. The participant will be required 
to perform those measures in the plan which are essential to the 
effectiveness of the practice for which costs are shared. In the 
development of the plan, consideration will be given to wildlife, 
watershed protection, recreation, erosion control, aesthetics, and other 
associated forest resources values as well as cost-effective timber 
production.

Sec. 701.33  The National program.

    The National program is based on recommendations developed by the 
Director, Conservation and Environmental Protection Division, FSA, in 
consultation with representatives of the U.S. Forest Service and the 
committee of State foresters provided for in Sec. 701.31.


<R05>
Sec. 701.34  Development of State programs.

    (a) A State program shall be developed in each State in accordance 
with the provisions contained in this part and in the National program 
and such modifications thereof as may thereafter be made. The program 
shall be developed by the State forestry committee as provided in 
Sec. 701.2.
    (b) The program for the State shall be that recommended by the State 
committee and State forester and approved by the Director, Conservation 
and Environmental Protection Division, FSA, after consulting the U.S. 
Forest Service.


<R05>
Sec. 701.35  Development of county programs.

    (a) A county program shall be developed in each designated county in 
accordance with the provisions of the State program and such 
modifications thereof as may be made. The county program shall be 
developed by the county conservation review group. The county 
conservation review group, working with the governing body of the 
conservation district, the State forestry agency representatives, the 
county supervisor of the Farmers Home Administration, and others with 
conservation and environmental interest, shall develop recommendations 
for the county program.
    (b) The program for the county shall be that recommended by the 
county committee and service forester and approved by the State 
committee and State forester.

<R05>
Sec. 701.36  Adaptation of practices.

    (a) The practices included in the State program meet the conditions 
and requirements of the National program. National program provisions 
may be modified or deleted to make practices more restrictive where such 
changes meet the objectives of the program.
    (b) The practices included in the county program must meet the 
conditions and requirements of the State program. State program 
provisions may be modified or deleted to make practices more restrictive 
where such changes will still result in the practices effectively 
meeting the objectives of the program.


<R05>
Sec. 701.37  Levels and rates of cost-sharing.

    (a) The maximum cost-share for each practice shall be the percentage 
of the actual cost of performing the practice considered necessary to 
obtain the needed performance of the practice, but which will be such 
that the participant will make a significant contribution to the cost of 
performing the practice.
    (b) Levels of cost-sharing shall be approved by the State ASC 
committee and shall not be in excess of 65 percent of actual costs 
incurred by the landowners.
    (c) For the purpose of establishing rates of cost-sharing, the 
average cost of performing a practice may be the average cost for a 
State, a county or a part of a county, as determined by the State 
committee.
    (d) The rates of cost-sharing for practices included in the county 
program may be lower than the rates approved for general use in the 
State.

<R05>
Sec. 701.38  Prior approval for cost-sharing.

    Costs will be shared only for those practices, or components of 
practices, for which cost-sharing is requested and approval issued 
before performance thereof is started.


<R05>
Sec. 701.39  Methods of approval.

    The county committee will determine the extent to which Federal 
funds will be made available to share the cost of each approved 
practice. Approvals shall be made based on consideration of the county 
allocation, cost-effective opportunities for increasing timber 
production, potential for enhancing other forest resources, the forestry 
needs in the county, and the practices for which requested cost-sharing 
is considered by the county committee as most needed. The method 
approved shall provide for the issuance of notices of approval showing 
for each approved practice the number of units of the practice for which 
the Federal Government will share in the cost and the amount of the 
cost-share for the performance of that number of units of the practice. 
Notices of appeared practices shall be issued before performance of the 
practice may be started. No practice may be approved for cost-sharing 
except as authorized by the National, State or county program, or in 
accordance with procedures incorporated therein. Available funds for 
cost-sharing shall not be allocated on a pro-rata basis, but shall be 
directed to the accomplishment of the most production attainable.
    (a) Cost-sharing may be approved under annual agreements or long-
term agreements.
    (b) Land covered by a Great Plains Conservation Program contract is 
not excluded from an annual or long-term agreement if otherwise eligible 
and is approved by both the Forest Service and the Soil Conservation 
Service.
    (c) The same practices, cost-share levels and general program 
provisions apply to both annual agreements and long-term agreements.


<R05>
Sec. 701.40  Long-term agreements.

    (a) The period of a long-term agreement will be for not less than 
three (3) years nor more than 10 (10) years. The county committee and 
the signatories to the agreement in consultation with the State forestry 
representative, will mutually determine the scheduling of essential 
practices and practice cost-sharing over the period of the agreement.
    (b) The long-term agreement will be based on a forest management 
plan for the land which has been developed by the service forester.
    (c) The long-term agreement will provide that the owner will carry 
out those measures in the forest management plan which are determined to 
be essential whether or not cost-sharing is approved for such measures.
    (d) The level of cost-sharing in effect for practices in all years 
of a long-term agreement shall be the level in effect for the beginning 
year of the agreement. The rate of cost-sharing for payment purposes for 
such practice will be based on the average cost of performing the 
practice at the time the practice is performed.
    (e) A long-term agreement may be canceled for failure to comply with 
the terms of the agreement if, after consulting with the service 
forester, the county committee and State committee find that the 
seriousness of the irregularities warrant such action. If the agreement 
is canceled, the signatories to the agreement are jointly and severally 
responsible for refunding all cost-shares paid and will forfeit all 
rights to further payments under the agreement. In such a case no other 
refund or forfeiture provisions of these regulations apply.
    (f) A long-term agreement may be revised in accordance with 
instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator, State and County 
Operations, where there is a change in status of the participants or the 
land under agreement.
    (g) An eligible person who acquires control of land under an 
approved agreement may elect to become a successor in interest under 
such agreement.
    (h) An agreement will be terminated with respect to land for which 
loss of control has occurred and where the person acquiring control of 
such land elects not to become a successor in interest under the 
agreement. If the loss of control is for reasons beyond the

[[Page 33]]

control of the signatories to the agreement, the county committee will 
determine whether or not any cost-shares previously paid shall be 
refunded, but in no event shall the refund be greater than would be 
required in cases where loss of control is voluntary. If the loss of 
control is voluntary on the part of the signatories, they will be 
jointly and severally responsible for refunding all cost-shares paid and 
will forfeit all rights to further payments, with respect to the land 
for which control is lost. A refund will not be required for cost-shares 
where, the county committee and the State committee determine, after 
consulting with the service forester, that failure to perform the 
remaining practices in the agreement will not impair the effectiveness 
of the practices which have been performed and that the completed 
practices will provide forestry benefits consistent with the cost-shares 
which have been paid.
    (i) An agreement may be terminated if, after considering the 
recommendation of the service forester, the county committee recommends 
and the State committee concurs that such action is in the public 
interest.


<R05>
Sec. 701.41  Restoration of practices.

    (a) Cost-sharing may be authorized under the program only for the 
establishment or installation of the practices contained in this part. 
Cost-sharing may not be authorized for repeating any of the practices in 
this part with the same owner on the same acreage, except as provided in 
paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.
    (b) Cost-sharing may be authorized for the replacement, enlargement, 
or restoration of practices for which cost-sharing has been allowed 
under the program only if all of the following conditions exist:
    (1) Replacement or restoration of the practice is needed to solve 
the problem.
    (2) The failure of the original practice was not due to the lack of 
proper maintenance by the current operator.
    (3) The county committee believes that the replacement or 
restoration of the practice merits consideration under the program to an 
equal extent with other practices cost-shared.
    (c) Cost-sharing may be authorized for timber stand improvement 
measures carried out in repetitive steps where, in the judgment of the 
service forester, the stand treatment warrants such silvicultural 
practice.


<R05>
Sec. 701.42  Maximum cost-share limitations.

    For each fiscal year the total of all cost-shares paid to any 
eligible person shall not exceed the sum of $10,000 with respect to 
eligible ownerships (Sec. 701.30(b)) in the United States or any 
commonwealth, territory or possessions of the United States for approved 
practices carried out under annual and/or long-term agreements.


<R05>
Sec. 701.43  Completion of practice.

    Cost-sharing for the practices contained in this subpart is 
conditioned upon the performance of the practices in accordance with all 
applicable specifications and program provisions.


<R05>
Sec. 701.44  Time of filing payment application.

    Payment of cost-shares will be made only upon application submitted 
on the prescribed form to the county office by the prescribed time limit 
or any authorized extension thereof. Any application for payment may be 
rejected if any form or information required of the applicant is not 
submitted to the county office within the applicable time limit.


<R05>
Sec. 701.45  Other program provisions.

    Other provisions as contained in Secs. 701.1 and 701.2 and in the 
subpart, General Provisions, apply to the Forestry Incentives Program.

                 Subpart--Emergency Conservation Program


<R05>
Sec. 701.46  Program objective.

    The objective of the Emergency Conservation Program is to cost-share 
with eligible persons to rehabilitate farmlands damaged by wind and 
water erosion, floods, hurricanes, or other natural disasters and to 
provide water conservation or water enhancement measures during periods 
of severe drought.

[[Page 34]]


<R05>
Sec. 701.47  Program availability.

    (a) The county committee may implement the program subject to the 
availability of funds where new conservation problems have been created 
on farmland by a natural disaster or wind erosion which, if not treated; 
will:
    (1) Impair or endanger the land or water resource.
    (2) Materially affects the productive capacity of the land or water 
resource.
    (3) Represent damage which is unusual in character and, except for 
wind erosion, shall not be the type that would recur frequently in the 
same area.
    (4) Be so costly to rehabilitate that Federal assistance is or will 
be required to return the land to productive agricultural use.
    (b) Subject to the availability of funds, the county committee with 
the concurrence of the State committee and approval of the Deputy 
Administrator, State and County Operations may implement the program to 
carry out emergency water conservation and water enhancement measures 
during periods of severe drought.


<R05>
Sec. 701.48  Eligibility of person and land.

    Eligibility of person and land is the same as for the Agricultural 
Conservation Program as provided in Secs. 701.7 and 701.8.


<R05>
Sec. 701.49  Emergency conservation program practices.

    (a) Except for severe drought and wind erosion, cost-sharing may be 
offered for emergency conservation practices only to replace or restore 
farmland to a condition similar to that existing prior to the natural 
disaster. Cost-sharing may not be offered for the solution of 
conservation problems existing prior to the disaster.
    (b) Emergency Conservation Program practices for which cost-sharing 
may be authorized are generally:
    (1) Removing debris from farmland.
    (2) Grading, shaping, releveling or similar measures.
    (3) Restoring permanent fences.
    (4) Restoring structures and other installations.
    (5) Emergency wind control measures.
    (6) Drought emergency measures.
    (7) Other emergency conservation measures.


<R05>
Sec. 701.50  Practice approval.

    Practices listed in Sec. 701.49(b)(1) through (5) may be approved by 
the county committees. Practices (6) and (7) of Sec. 701.49(b) must be 
approved by the Deputy Administrator, State and County Operations.


<R05>
Sec. 701.51  Extent of cost-sharing.

    (a) The maximum payment under this subpart per person, per disaster, 
is limited to $200,000, including the amount of any payment received by 
such person as the result of a disaster under a pooling agreement.
    (b) The cost-share payments which may be made by FSA for a practice 
under the program shall, subject to the maximum payment amount specified 
in paragraph (a) of this section and any other limitation as may apply, 
be further limited to the level of cost-share assistance established by 
the county committee not to exceed the following amounts:
    (1) 64 percent of the first $62,500 of eligible reimbursable costs; 
plus
    (2) 40 percent of the second $62,500 of eligible reimbursable costs; 
plus
    (3) 20 percent of the remaining eligible reimbursable costs up to 
such amount as would produce a cost-share not in excess of the 
limitation in paragraph (a) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 701.52  Eligible costs.

    Upon determination that a person is eligible for Emergency 
Conservation Program assistance, cost-sharing shall be granted for all 
reasonable costs incurred in the completion of the practice. Such costs 
may include personal labor, equipment, and other such costs which are 
determined by the county committee to be related to the costs of 
carrying out the practice. County committees shall limit costs for the 
use of personal equipment to an amount that reflects out-of-pocket 
expenses. Expenses for personal labor and personal equipment should be 
less than rates charged by contractors who expect to make a profit for 
their efforts.

[[Page 35]]


<R05>
Sec. 701.53  Filing requests.

    The county committee shall establish a sign up period for filing 
cost-sharing requests immediately after the county committee's decision 
has been made (by the Deputy Administrator, State and County Operations, 
in cases of drought) to implement the Emergency Conservation Program in 
the county. Such periods should be at least 30 days in length. Late 
filed requests may be accepted by the county committee in justifiable 
cases.


<R05>
Sec. 701.54  Approving requests.

    County committees will issue practice approvals only when the 
requested practice has been determined eligible for cost-sharing 
assistance and the eligible person has indicated he/she is ready to 
start the practice.


<R05>
Sec. 701.55  Pooling agreements.

    Pooling agreements may be used on the same basis as provided for in 
the Agricultural Conservation Program in Sec. 701.18.


<R05>
Sec. 701.56  Payment approval.

    The county committee is authorized to approve payments not to exceed 
$10,000 per person, per disaster. Cost-share assistance in excess of 
$10,000 must be approved by the Deputy Administrator, State and County 
Operations, or designee.


<R05>
Sec. 701.57  Other program provisions.

    Other provisions of this part as provided for in Secs. 701.1 and 
701.2 and in the subpart, General Provisions, apply to the Emergency 
Conservation Program.


<R04>
                       Subpart--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 701.58  Restriction on program eligibility.

    The regulations in part 796 of this chapter prohibiting the making 
of payments to program participants who harvest or knowingly permit to 
be harvested for illegal use, marijuana or other such prohibited drug-
producing plants on any part of the land owned or controlled by them are 
applicable to these programs.


<R05>
Sec. 701.59  Delegation of authority.

    No delegation of authority contained in these programs to a State or 
county committee shall preclude the Deputy Administrator, State and 
County Operations or designee, from determining any question arising 
under these programs or from reversing or modifying any determination 
made by a State or county committee.


<R05>
Sec. 701.60  Practice specifications.

    (a) Minimum specifications that practices must meet to be eligible 
for cost-sharing shall be set forth in the county program, or 
incorporated therein by specific reference to a standard publication or 
other written document containing such specifications.
    (b) Practice specifications shall represent those levels of 
performance which are needed in order for the practice to be effective 
in meeting the program objective and which are not in excess of levels 
for which cost-sharing can be justified.


<R05>
Sec. 701.61  Responsibility for technical phases of practices.

    The Soil Conservation Service and the U.S. Forest Service are 
responsible for technical phases of the practice as assigned and such 
assignment will be specified in State and county programs.
    (a) The State conservationist of the Soil Conservation Service may 
utilize assistance from private, State or Federal agencies in carrying 
out the assigned responsibilities. No responsibilities will be assigned 
for counties when the Deputy Administrator, State and County Operations 
and the Administrator, SCS, determines that it would not be 
administratively practicable for the Soil Conservation Service to 
discharge such responsibilities. In such counties, these 
responsibilities shall be assumed by the county committees. The Soil 
Conservation Service may utilize to the fullest extent available 
resources of the State forestry agencies in carrying out assigned 
responsibilities for practices involving the establishment of wind-
breaks or shelterbelts on farmland to prevent wind erosion.

[[Page 36]]

    (b) The U.S. Forest Service is responsible for the technical phases 
of practices or components of practices involving the planting of trees 
for forestry purposes and those involving the improving or protecting of 
a stand of forest trees, as specified in State and county programs. The 
U.S. Forest Service may utilize the assistance of private, State or 
Federal agencies in carrying out these assigned responsibilities, but 
services of State forestry agencies will be utilized to the extent that 
such services are available.
    (c) The technical assistance to be furnished in servicing assigned 
practices will include, where appropriate, the following technical 
phases:
    (1) Determining whether the practice is needed and practicable;
    (2) Selecting the site (if necessary), complying with environmental 
and cultural regulations, determining the specific measures needed, and 
performing any required layout work for the practice;
    (3) Supervising the installation of the practice if needed to assure 
conformity with specifications; and
    (4) Certifying the extent performed and whether the specifications 
for the practice have been met. The technical agency shall perform all 
four phases for all assigned practices in State and county programs, 
except as may be provided in instructions issued by the Deputy 
Administrator, State and County Operations.


<R05>
Sec. 701.62  Items of cost on which rates of cost-sharing may be based.

    Except as otherwise provided by the specific FSA procedural 
handbooks, notices, and regulations, the cost of any direct and 
significant factor in the performance of a practice may be considered in 
establishing the rate of cost-sharing for the practice.


<R05>
Sec. 701.63  Handbook, bulletins, instructions, and forms.

    The Deputy Administrator, State and County Operations is authorized 
to prepare and issue handbooks, bulletins, instructions, and forms, 
required in administering these programs. Copies of handbooks, 
bulletins, instructions and forms, containing detailed information on 
these programs as they apply to specific States, counties, areas, farms, 
ranches and other eligible ownerships, will be available in the office 
of the State committee and the office of the county committee.


<R05>
Sec. 701.64  Opportunity for requesting cost-shares.

    Farmers, ranchers, eligible landowners, or eligible persons, 
regardless of race, sex, religion, color, or national origin, shall be 
given an opportunity to request that the Federal Government share in the 
cost of those practices they consider to be needed on their farm, ranch, 
or other eligible land. The county committee shall direct the available 
funds for cost-sharing to those practices where cost-sharing is 
considered most essential to the accomplishment of the program 
objective.


<R05>
Sec. 701.65  Repair, upkeep and maintenance of practices.

    Cost-sharing is not authorized for repairs or for normal upkeep or 
maintenance of any practice.


<R05>
Sec. 701.66  Public benefits when installing practices.

    Persons responsible for any aspect of performing practices are to be 
encouraged to install the practices in such a way to promote public 
benefits by improving or preserving environmental quality and ecological 
balance by preventing or abating pollution and other environmental 
degradation; benefiting the community by such means as preserving open 
space, or enhancing the appearance of the area; benefiting wildlife and 
other desirable life forms; preserving historic, archeological, or 
scenic sites, wetlands, ecologically critical areas and prime farmlands; 
avoiding the creation of hazards to persons or animals and avoiding 
actions that may adversely affect an endangered or threatened species 
and flood plains.


<R05>
Sec. 701.67  Payments for uncompleted practices.

    Cost-shares approved under these programs will not be considered as 
earned until all components of the approved practice are completed in 
accordance with applicable specifications and program provisions. Cost-
shares

[[Page 37]]

for completed components may be paid only on the condition that the 
farmers, ranchers, or eligible landowners, will complete the remaining 
components of the practice within the time prescribed by the county 
committee regardless of whether cost-sharing is offered for them, unless 
they are prevented from doing so because of reasons beyond their 
control.


<R05>
Sec. 701.68  Practices involving the establishment or improvement of vegetative cover.

    (a) Costs for practices involving the establishment or improvement 
of vegetative cover, including trees may be shared even though a good 
stand is not established, if the country committee determines, in 
accordance with standards approved by the State committee, that the 
practice was carried out in a manner which could normally result in the 
establishment of a good stand, and that failure to establish a good 
stand was due to weather or other conditions beyond the control of the 
operator. The county committee may require as a condition of cost-
sharing in such cases that the area be reseeded or replanted or that 
other needed protective measures be carried out. Cost-sharing in such 
cases may be approved also for repeat applications of measures 
previously carried out or for additional eligible measures. Cost-sharing 
for such measures shall be approved to the extent such measures are 
needed to assure a good stand even though less than that required by the 
applicable practice wording for initial approvals.
    (b) In the case of Foresty Incentives Program, replanting of trees 
is required where the landowner received cost-sharing for site 
preparation.


<R05>
Sec. 701.69  Failure to meet minimum requirements or failure to comply fully with program provisions.

    (a) Notwithstanding other provisions of these programs, costs may be 
shared for performance actually rendered even though the minimum 
requirements for a practice are not met, if the farmer, rancher, 
eligible landowner, or eligible person establishes to the satisfaction 
of the county committee and the county representative of any other 
agency having responsibility for technical phases of the practice that a 
reasonable effort was made to meet the minimum requirements and that the 
practice as performed adequately solves the problem.
    (b) Notwithstanding the provisions in paragraph (a) of this section, 
the terms and conditions of contracts entered into pursuant to programs 
in this part may be modified to grant relief when the Deputy 
Administrator, State and County Operations, determines that a person 
acting in good faith failed to fully comply with the program provisions.


<R05>
Sec. 701.70  Practices carried out with aid from ineligible persons.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, financial 
assistance which is made available, or will be made available, to a 
program participant from a person ineligible for cost-share assistance 
under this part for the practice, including aid from a State or Federal 
agency other than assistance made available under this part, shall be 
deducted from the program participant's total costs incurred for the 
practice for purposes of determining the applicant's eligible 
reimbursable costs under this part.
    (b) Third party contributions need not be deducted under paragraph 
(a) of this section where it is determined by the State ASC Committee, 
in accordance with instructions of the Deputy Administrator, State and 
County Operations (DASCO), FSA, that an exception would be in 
furtherance of program objectives. However, the total cost-share paid 
may not, in any case, exceed the net contribution (exclusive of any 
contribution by ineligible persons) otherwise made by the applicant to 
the cost of carrying out the practice.

[56 FR 46368, Sept. 12, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 701.71  Division of cost-shares.

    (a) The cost-share for a practice shall be credited to the person 
who carried out the practice. If more than one person contributed to the 
carrying out of the practice, the cost-share for the practice shall be 
divided among those persons in the proportion that the county committee 
determines they contributed to the carrying out of the

[[Page 38]]

practice. In making this determination, the county committee shall take 
into consideration the value of the labor, equipment, or material 
contributed by each person toward the carrying out of the practice, and 
shall assume that each contributed equally unless the county committee 
is satisfied that their respective contributions were not in equal 
proportion. Any advances made by FSA toward the cost of materials or 
services under Sec. 701.21, the furnishing of land, and the furnishing 
of the right to use water, will not be considered as a contribution to 
the carrying out of any practice.
    (b) The allowance by an eligible person of a credit to another 
eligible person in the form of an adjustment in rental, an exchange of 
cash, or other consideration, will not be considered as a contribution 
to the carrying out of any practice, unless the county committee is 
satisfied that such credit is directly related to the cost or cost-share 
of the practice. A person will not be considered as having contributed 
to the carrying out of a practice if the county committee determines 
that a person has been, or is to be, fully reimbursed for contributions 
made to the performance of the practice, through an adjustment in 
rental, an exchange of cash, or other consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 701.72  Death, incompetency, or disappearance.

    In case of death, incompetency, or disappearance of any person, any 
cost-shares due shall be paid to the successor, determined in accordance 
with provisions of the regulations in part 707 of this chapter, as 
amended.


<R05>
Sec. 701.73  Applying cost-share limitations.

    (a) All or any part of cost-share which otherwise would be due any 
person for a program year may be withheld, or required to be refunded, 
if, with respect to that program year, the person has adopted, or 
participated in adopting, any scheme or device, including the 
dissolution, reorganization, revival, formation, or use of any 
corporation, partnership, estate, trust, or any other means, designed to 
evade a maximum cost-share limitation.
    (b) The rules set forth in 7 CFR 795.3 through 795.22 shall apply in 
determining whether certain individuals or other entities are to be 
considered as separate persons for the purpose of applying any maximum 
payment limitations provided for in this part. In cases where more than 
one rule would appear to be applicable, the rule which is most 
restrictive as to number of persons shall apply.

<R05>
Sec. 701.74  Persons eligible to file application for payment of cost-shares.

    Any eligible person who bore a part of the cost of an approved 
practice is eligible to file an application for payment of cost-shares 
due.


<R05>
Sec. 701.75  Time and manner of filing application and required information.

    It shall be the responsibility of persons participating in these 
programs to submit to the county office forms and information needed to 
establish the extent of the performance of approved practices and 
compliance with applicable program provisions. The time limits for 
submission of such forms and information shall be established where 
necessary for efficient administration of the programs. Such time limits 
shall afford a full and fair opportunity to those eligible to file the 
forms and information within the period prescribed. At least 2 weeks 
notice of any general time limits prescribed shall be given to the 
public. The notice shall be given by mailing notice to the office of 
each county committee and making copies available to the press. Other

of 70 percent of the average or actual cost of installation of the SRP 
or in excess of the level based on the ratio of on-farm and offsite 
benefits if such increased assistance is necessary to obtain acceptable 
program participation. Higher cost-share levels shall be considered only 
when one or more of the following apply, unless the Secretary finds at 
his descretion that such cost-sharing requirement would result in a 
failure to proceed with needed on-farm measures:
    (1) On-farm benefits that are low relative to offsite benefits;
    (2) Higher degree of project cost-effectiveness and magnitude of 
salinity reduction benefits to be achieved relative to other projects;
    (3) The need for and the cost of implementing voluntary SRP's to 
replace incidental fish and wildlife values foregone;
    (d) The combined cost-share assistance provided by Federal, State, 
and local governments or subdivisions thereof shall not exceed 100 
percent of the cost of installing the SRP.

the establishment of canal and laterals improvements in amounts 
exceeding $400,000.
    (c) Cost-sharing payments in excess of $100,000 shall be considered 
only when such payment will result in greater total offsite benefits, 
because the offsite benefits for the participants SCP, are greater than 
those of other participants under consideration at the same time and one 
or more of the following conditions exist:
    (1) The cost of establishing required SRP's on the participant's 
land is high relative to the cost of installing practices on other

of a CRSC Contract or operation and maintenance agreement may be 
required to refund all or a portion of the cost-share assistance earned 
under the program.


<R05>
Sec. 702.18  Violations.

    (a)(1) If a participant violates the CRSC Contract or any related

operation and maintenance agreement.
    (2) If the CRSC Contract is terminated by the COC in accordance with 
this section, the participant shall forfeit all rights to further cost-
share payments under the CRSC Contract and shall refund all or part of 
the payments received as determined by the COC.
    (b) The following actions constitute a violation of the CRSC 
Contract or any related operation and maintenance agreement by a 
participant:
    (1) Destruction of a SRP on land which is the subject of a CRSC 
Contract, unless prior approval in writing is granted by FSA with SCS

[[Page 48]]

participant's obligations under such other program have been met; or
    (5) Employment of any scheme or device to obtain cost-share 
assistance or additional cost-share assistance, or to deprive any other 
land user of cost-share assistance or the right to participate in the 
program.
    (c) The Deputy Administrator may terminate any CRSC Contract and any 
related operation and maintenance agreements by mutual agreement with 
the paticipant based upon recommendations from COC, STC, SCS, and CD, if 
the termination of the CRSC Contract and operation and maintenance 
agreement is determined to be in the best interest of the public.
    (d) If the participant fails to perform the terms and conditions of 
the CRSC contract and the Deputy Administrator determines, after 
considering the recommendations of the CD and SCS, that such failure 
does not warrant termination of the CRSC contract, the Deputy 
Administrator may require such participant to refund all or part of the 
payments received under the CRSC contract, or to accept such adjustments 
in the payment as are determined to be appropriate by the Deputy 
Administrator.

Sec. 702.19  CRSC Contracts and operation and maintenance agreements not in conformity with regulations.

    If, after a CRSC Contract and related operation and maintenance 
agreement are entered in by the COC with a participant, it is discovered 
that such contract and operation and maintenance agreement are not in 
conformity with the provisions of this part as the result of a 
misunderstanding of the program procedures by a signatory to the 
contract and operation and maintenance agreement, a modification of the 
contract and operation and maintenance agreement may be made by mutual 
agreement. If the parties to the CRSC Contract and operation and 
maintenance agreement cannot reach agreement with respect to such 
modification, the contract and operation and maintenance agreement shall 
be terminated and all payments paid or payable under the contract shall 
be forfeited or refunded to the Federal government, except as may 
otherwise be allowed in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 702.18 of 
this part.

of precedence is a minor, payment of his share shall be made to his 
legal guardian, but if no legal guardian has been appointed payment

<R05>
Sec. 711.6  Eligibility as member of a panel.

    Any farmer who meets the eligibility requirements for county 
committeeman prescribed in the regulations in part 7 of subtitle A of 
this title, as amended, in a county within the area of venue for which 
he is to be appointed shall be eligible for appointment as a member of a 
review committee panel for such area of venue. If the area of venue 
consists of only one county or a part of a county, these eligibility 
requirements must be met in such county or in a nearby county. No farmer 
whose legal residence is in one State shall be eligible for appointment 
as a member of a review committee panel for an area of venue in another 
State.


<R05>
Sec. 711.7  Appointment of members of a panel.

    The Secretary shall appoint six or more eligible farmers to serve as 
members of a review committee panel in each area of venue. Notice of 
appointment shall be sent to the State committee, which shall notify the 
farmers so appointed. Appointments may be made before, during, or after 
the period in which applications for review of quotas are required to be 
filed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Secretary shall have the 
continuing power to revoke or suspend any appointment made pursuant to 
the regulations in this part, and subject to the provisions of the act, 
to make such other appointment deemed proper.

[[Page 55]]


<R05>
Sec. 711.8  Oath of office.

    Each farmer appointed to serve as a member of a review committee 
panel shall, as soon as possible after appointment, execute an oath of 
office on such form as may be prescribed by the Deputy Administrator, 
duly subscribed and sworn to or affirmed before a notary public. No 
farmer shall serve on a review committee unless such oath of office has 
been duly executed and filed with the State executive director or the 
clerk. A farmer appointed for consecutive terms to serve as a member of 
a review committee panel shall not be required to file a new oath of 
office after the original filing. If the form of oath of office is 
materially changed, a new oath of office shall be executed if required 
by the Deputy Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 711.9  Composition of review committee.

    (a) Three designated members from the panel constitute a review 
committee. Three members from the panel shall act as a review committee 
to hear applications for review for the prescribed area of venue. The 
State executive director shall designate from the panel of members for 
the prescribed area of venue three members who shall act as a review 
committee to hear specific applications and shall designate one of these 
three members as chairman of the review committee and another member as 
vice-chairman. Where the number of applications pending require two or 
more review committees for prompt disposition of such applications, the 
State executive director shall designate the members of each review 
committee, the chairman and vice chairman thereof, and the specific 
application to be heard by each review committee. Two or more review 
committees may hear applications concurrently in an area of venue. In 
the absence of the chairman, the vice chairman shall perform the duties 
and exercise the powers of the chairman. The State executive director 
shall notify members of each review committee of the schedule of 
hearings. No member shall serve in any case in which a quota will be 
reviewed for a farm in which such member, any of his relatives or 
business associates, is interested, nor shall any member serve where he 
had acted as State, county, or community committee member on a quota to 
be reviewed by the review committee.
    (b) Only two members present to commence hearing. Where only two 
members of a review committee are present to commence a hearing, 
although three members were scheduled to hear the application, at the 
request of or with the consent of the applicant in writing, a hearing 
conducted by two members of the review committee shall be deemed to be a 
regular hearing of the review committee as to such application. The 
determination made by such members shall constitute the determination of 
the review committee. In the event such members cannot agree upon a 
determination, such fact shall be set forth in writing and a new hearing 
scheduled by the State executive director. If the applicant does not 
consent in writing to a hearing conducted by two members of the review 
committee, the hearing shall be rescheduled.
    (c) Only two members remain to complete a hearing. Where only two 
members of a review committee remain to complete a hearing commenced 
with three members, due to serious illness, death, or other cause which 
prevents one of the members from completing the hearing within a 
reasonable time, at the request or with the consent of the applicant in 
writing, the remaining two members of the review committee shall 
henceforth constitute an entire review committee for the purpose of such 
hearing. In the event such members cannot agree upon a determination, 
such fact shall be set forth in writing and a new hearing scheduled by 
the State executive director. If the applicant does not consent in 
writing to completion of the hearing by two members of the review 
committee, the hearing shall be rescheduled.
    (d) Reopened or remanded hearings. In the case of a reopened or 
remanded hearing, if any member of the review committee is no longer in 
office because of death, resignation, or ineligibility, the State 
executive director shall designate another member of the review 
committee panel to serve on the review committee. If a hearing held 
pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section is reopened or remanded 
and

[[Page 56]]

only one review committee member is available to hear such reopened or 
remanded hearing, the State executive director shall designate two 
additional members from the review committee panel to serve on the 
review committee.


<R05>
Sec. 711.10  Term of office.

    Appointment as a member of a review committee panel shall be for a 
term of 3 calendar years. A member may be reappointed for succeeding 
terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a review committee shall continue 
in office to conclude hearings before it which are begun during such 3-
year term and make final determinations thereof, or to hold a reopened 
hearing, or to conclude a hearing remanded to it by a court.

[Amdt. 3, 38 FR 967, Jan. 8, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 711.11  Compensation.

    The members designated as review committeemen shall receive 
compensation when serving at the same rate as that received by the 
members of the county committee which established the quotas sought to 
be reviewed. No member of a review committee shall be entitled to 
receive compensation for services as such member for more than 30 days 
in any one year. Payment of compensation, reimbursement for travel 
expenses and rates therefor, shall be made under such conditions as may 
be prescribed by the Deputy Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 711.12  Effect of change in composition of review committee.

    Nothing contained in Secs. 711.6 to 711.11 relating to any vacancy 
or revocation or suspension of appointment and nothing done pursuant 
thereto shall be construed as affecting the validity of any prior 
hearing conducted or determination made in accordance with the 
regulations in this part, in which the member of the review committee 
whose office has become vacant participated, or as affecting in any way 
court proceeding which may be instituted to review such determination.

                              Jurisdiction


<R05>
Sec. 711.13  Areas of venue and jurisdiction.

    (a) Areas of venue. The State committee shall establish one or more 
areas of venue in the State. An area of venue may consist of all or part 
of a county, or more than one county within a State. In establishing 
areas of venue, the State committee shall take into consideration the 
requirements of section 363 of the Act as to eligibility of review 
committee members, the prompt handling of applications for review, 
transportation problems and the limit of 30-day service by review 
committeemen in any one year.
    (b) Jurisdiction. A review committee shall have jurisdiction within 
the area of venue for which it is established to hear applications 
respecting quotas established or denied by written notice issued by the 
county committee or other authorized official for farms within its area 
of venue, in accordance with this part.
    (c) A listing of the areas of venue within a State shall be 
available from the State FSA office and the Deputy Administrator.

                     Application for Review of Quota


<R05>
Sec. 711.14  Application for review.

    (a) Manner and time of filing. Any farmer who is dissatisfied with 
his quota may, within 15 days after the date of mailing to him of notice 
of such quota, file a written application for review thereof by the 
review committee. Such 15-day period is prescribed in accordance with 
section 363 of the Act. Unless application for review is timely filed, 
as determined under this section, the quota established by the notice 
shall not be subject to review by the review committee. Notice of quota 
subject to review under this part includes an official written notice as 
to the land constituting the farm. For example, a notice denying a 
request for farm reconstitution would be such a reviewable notice of 
quota. An application shall be in writing and addressed to, and filed 
with, the county executive director for the county from which the

[[Page 57]]

notice of quota was received. Any application (Form MQ-53 available on 
request) whether made on Form MQ-53 or not, shall contain the following:
    (1) Date of application and commodity (including type where 
applicable, e.g. Upland cotton, Flue-cured tobacco).
    (2) Correct full name and address of applicant.
    (3) Brief statement of each ground upon which the application is 
based.
    (4) A statement of the amount of quota which it is claimed should 
have been established.
    (5) Signature of applicant.

In any case where an application is timely filed for review of a quota 
on a farm which was reconstituted by division of a parent farm into two 
or more farms, such application shall be considered an application for 
review of the reconstitution of the parent farm. In any such case the 
farm operator of each farm resulting from such reconstitution shall be 
considered an applicant for purposes of this part with all the rights 
and privileges provided in this part. If an action may be taken by an 
applicant which affects the rights of any other applicant in the case, 
the other applicants shall be given the opportunity to concur in such 
action or to oppose such action.
    (b) Procedure where application is not timely filed. The county 
committee shall examine each application for review. If the application 
is not filed within the prescribed 15-day period, the county executive 
director shall send a notice of untimely filing on Form MQ-54 by 
certified mail to the applicant at the address shown on the application. 
The applicant may file a request in writing with the county executive 
director within 15 days after the date of mailing such notice to him 
requesting a review committee hearing on the sole issue of whether the 
application was filed within the prescribed 15-day period. In the 
absence of timely request in writing for such review committee hearing, 
the application shall be deemed withdrawn by the applicant. If timely 
request in writing for such review committee hearing is filed, a copy of 
the application and request shall be forwarded by the county executive 
director to the State executive director with a request that a hearing 
on the sole issue of timely filing be scheduled before the review 
committee. In cases involving the sole issue of timely filing of an 
application, the review committee shall determine whether the date the 
application was filed, or the postmark date in case of mailing by the 
applicant, was within the 15-day period. If the review committee 
determines that the application was timely filed, a hearing on the 
merits of the application shall be held. In addition, a hearing on the 
merits shall be conducted and the application treated as timely filed in 
any case where the review committee determines that the applicant in 
good faith requested review of his quota by the county or State 
committee under the regulations in part 780 of this chapter in reliance 
upon action or advice of any authorized representative of a county or 
State committee and subsequently filed application for review under this 
part within a reasonable time after he learns that the quota is subject 
to review committee jurisdiction.
    (c) Withdrawal of application. An application may be withdrawn upon 
the written request of the applicant. Any application so withdrawn or 
deemed withdrawn under paragraph (b) of this section shall be endorsed 
by the clerk ``Dismissed by the applicant''.
    (d) Procedure where application is timely filed. The county 
committee shall examine each application for review and where an 
application is found to be timely filed, the county executive director 
shall forward a copy of the application to the State executive director 
with a request that a hearing on the merits be scheduled before the 
review committee.


<R05>
Sec. 711.15  Matters subject to review.

    In all cases, the review committee shall consider only such factors 
as, under applicable provisions of law and regulations, are required or 
permitted to be considered by the county committee in the establishment 
of the quota being reviewed. The establishment of national marketing 
quotas and apportionment of national acreage allotments and marketing 
quotas among States and counties and the establishment of reserve 
acreages and quotas at

[[Page 58]]

the national level and apportionment of such reserves among States and 
counties are not subject to review by a review committee. Review of a 
quota may include any of the factors which enter into the establishment 
of such quota for the farm and crop year as set forth in Sec. 711.3(f): 
Provided, however, That any factor of such quota considered by a review 
committee in a prior determination for the farm and crop year shall not 
be considered in a subsequent review proceeding. For example, a 
determination of the farm acreage allotment by the review committee 
would not be reconsidered upon any application for review of the farm 
marketing excess for the same farm and crop year.

[49 FR 38240, Sept. 28, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 711.16  County committee answer.

    (a) The county committee shall prepare a written answer to each 
application scheduled for hearing setting forth the pertinent facts, the 
applicable regulations, the data used in establishing the quota and any 
other matters deemed pertinent:
    (b) Provided, That the answer may be limited to the issue of timely 
filing where the hearing is limited to that issue. If the county 
committee determines that the increase, adjustment or other 
determination requested in the application is proper in whole or in 
part, the written answer shall set forth the proposed determination and 
in such cases, the applicant shall be notified by the county committee 
of such proposed determination prior to the scheduled review hearing if 
practicable to do so. In the event the applicant is satisfied with the 
proposed determination, the county committee shall, upon the withdrawal 
of the application, take the necessary action to revise the quota within 
the limits of the Act and applicable commodity regulations if the 
required amount of acreage allotment or marketing quota is available in 
the county. The State executive director may perform the functions of 
the county committee under this section and the functions of the county 
committee and county executive director under Sec. 711.14 (b) and (d) in 
any case where the application for review involves a notice of farm 
marketing quota issued by officials other than the county committee.

<R05>
Sec. 711.17  Amendments.

    Upon due request, and within the discretion of the review committee, 
the right to amend the application and all procedural documents in 
connection with any hearing, shall be granted upon such reasonable terms 
as the review committee may deem right and proper.

<R05>
Sec. 711.18  Place and schedule of hearing.

    The place of hearing shall be in the office of the county committee 
through which the quota sought to be reviewed was established, or such 
other appropriate place in the county as may be designated by the State 
executive director or by the review committee in cases arising under 
Sec. 711.21: Provided, however, That the place of hearing may be in some 
other county if agreed to in writing by the applicant. The State 
executive director shall schedule applications for hearings and forward 
such schedule to the clerk.


<R05>
Sec. 711.19  Notice of hearing.

    The clerk shall give written notice on Form MQ-56 to the applicant 
by depositing such notice in the U.S. mail, certified and addressed to 
the last known address of the applicant at least 10 days prior to the 
time appointed for the hearing and copies of such notice shall also be 
sent to the county committee and the State office. If the applicant 
requests waiver of such 10-day period, the hearing may be scheduled 
earlier upon consent of the other interested parties. The notice of the 
hearing shall specify the time and place of the hearing, contain a 
statement of the statutory authority for the hearing, state that the 
application will be heard by the review committee duly appointed for the 
area of venue in which the applicant's farm is located, and that a 
verbatim transcript may be obtained by the applicant if he makes 
arrangement therefor before the hearing and pays the expense thereof.

[[Page 59]]


<R05>
Sec. 711.20  Continuances.

    Hearings shall be held at the time and place set forth in the notice 
of hearing or in any subsequent notice amending or superseding the prior 
notice, but may without notice other than an announcement at the hearing 
by the chairman of the review committee, be continued from day to day or 
adjourned to a different place in the county or to a later date or to a 
date and place to be fixed in a subsequent notice to be issued pursuant 
to Sec. 711.19. In the event a full committee of three is not present, 
those members present, or in the absence of the entire committee, the 
clerk, shall postpone the hearing unless the hearing is held pursuant to 
Sec. 711.9 (b) or (c). There shall not be a continuance for lack of a 
full committee in the case of a reopened or remanded hearing where the 
hearing was initially held pursuant to Sec. 711.9 (b) or (c) and the two 
review committeemen who previously held the hearing are present and 
eligible to serve.


<R05>
Sec. 711.21  Conduct of hearing.

    (a) Open to public. Except as otherwise provided in Secs. 711.1 to 
711.50, each hearing shall take place before the entire review committee 
and shall be presided over by the chairman of such committee. The 
hearing shall be open to the public and shall be conducted in a fair and 
impartial manner and in such a way as to afford the applicant, members 
of the appropriate county and community committees, and appropriate 
officers and agents of the Department of Agriculture, and all persons 
appearing on behalf of such parties, reasonable opportunity to give and 
produce evidence relevant to the quota being reviewed.
    (b) Consolidation of hearings. Wherever practicable, two or more 
applications relating to the same commodity and the same farm shall be 
consolidated by the review committee on its own motion or at the request 
of the State executive director and heard at the same time on the same 
record. In any case involving two or more farms resulting from 
reconstitution by division of a parent farm, the hearing shall be 
consolidated.
    (c) Representation. The applicant and the Secretary may be 
represented at the hearing. The county committee shall be present or 
represented at the hearing.
    (d) Order of procedure. At the commencement of the hearing, the 
chairman of the review committee shall read or cause to be read the 
pertinent portions of the application for review. The written answer of 
the county committee shall be submitted and shall be made a part of the 
record of the hearing. If the applicant asserts and shows to the 
satisfaction of the review committee that he has not been informed of 
the county committee's position in time to afford him adequate 
opportunity to prepare and present his case, the review committee shall 
continue the hearing, without notice other than announcement thereof at 
the hearing, for such period of time as will afford the applicant 
reasonable opportunity to meet the issues of fact and law involved. 
After answer by the county committee and following such continuance, if 
any, as may be granted by the review committee, evidence shall be 
received with respect to the matters relevant to the quota under review 
in such order as the chairman of the review committee shall prescribe. 
The review committee may take official notice of relevant publications 
of the Department of Agriculture and regulations of the Secretary.
    (e) Submission of evidence. The burden of proof shall be upon the 
applicant as to all issues of fact raised by him. Each witness shall 
testify under oath or affirmation administered by the member of the 
review committee who is presiding at the hearing. The review committee 
shall confine the evidence to pertinent matters and shall exclude 
irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. Interested 
persons shall be permitted to present oral and documentary evidence, to 
submit rebuttal evidence and to conduct such cross-examination as may be 
required for a full and true disclosure of the facts. The hearing shall 
be concluded within such reasonable time as may be determined by the 
review committee.
    (f) Transcript of testimony. The review committee shall provide for 
the taking of such notes including but not limited to stenographic 
reports or recordings at the hearing as will enable it to make

[[Page 60]]

a summary of the proceedings and the testimony received at the hearing. 
The testimony received at the hearing shall be reported verbatim by a 
representative of a private firm under an existing Departmental contract 
for such services if the review committee, the State Executive Director, 
or the applicant, requests such transcript be made. If such transcript 
is so requested, the State Executive Director shall advise the Deputy 
Administrator, State and County Operations, prior to the hearing date 
who will then arrange for the service. A copy of such transcript shall 
be furnished to each of the following: The review committee, the State 
Executive Director, and the Regional Attorney, Office of the General 
Counsel, United States Department of Agriculture. The applicant or his 
representative may obtain a copy from the firm at his own expense.
    (g) Written arguments and proposed findings. The review committee 
shall permit the applicant, the members of the appropriate county and 
community committees, and appropriate officers and agents of the 
Department of Agriculture to file written arguments and proposed 
findings of fact and conclusions, based on the evidence adduced at the 
hearing, for the consideration of the review committee within such 
reasonable time after the conclusion of the hearing as may be prescribed 
by the review committee. Such written arguments and proposed findings 
shall be filed in triplicate with the clerk and an additional copy 
thereof shall be provided to the other party.

<R05>
Sec. 711.22  Nonappearance of applicant.

    (a) Original hearing. If, at the time of the hearing, the applicant 
is absent and no appearance is made on his behalf, the review committee 
shall, after a lapse of such period of time as it may consider proper 
and reasonable, have the name of the absent applicant called in the 
hearing room. If, upon such call, there is no response, and no 
appearance on behalf of such applicant and no continuance has been 
requested by the applicant, the review committee shall thereupon close 
the hearing, as to such applicant, and, without further proceedings in 
the case, make a determination dismissing the application.
    (b) Reopened or remanded hearing. If, at a hearing which is reopened 
pursuant to Sec. 711.25 or remanded by a court, the applicant is absent 
and no appearance is made on his behalf, the review committee shall 
continue the hearing for a reasonable period of time and if the 
applicant does not appear at such continued hearing, the review 
committee shall make a determination.


<R05>
Sec. 711.23  Determination by review committee.

    As soon as practicable after hearing on an application, including a 
hearing on the sole issue of timely filing, the review committee shall 
make a determination upon the application. If it is determined by the 
review committee that the application should be dismissed for untimely 
filing or denied, the review committee shall so indicate. If it is 
determined that the application should be granted in whole or in part, 
the review committee shall establish the quota which it finds to be 
proper. Each determination made by the review committee shall be in 
writing, shall contain specific findings of fact and conclusions 
together with the reasons or basis therefor, and shall be based upon and 
made in accordance with reliable, probative, and substantial evidence 
adduced at the hearing. The concurrence of two members of the review 
committee shall be sufficient to make a determination. The written 
determination shall contain such subscription by each member of the 
review committee as will indicate his concurrence therein or his dissent 
therefrom. In case of an increase in the quota, the review committee 
shall specifically state in the determination in what respect, if any, 
the county committee has failed properly to apply the act and 
regulations thereunder. If such increase is based upon evidence not 
available to the county committee, the findings of the review committee 
shall so indicate. The appropriate county executive director shall make 
available to the review committee such clerical and stenographic 
assistance as may be required.

[[Page 61]]


<R05>
Sec. 711.24  Service of determination.

    A copy of the determination, certified by the clerk as a true and 
correct copy of the signed original, shall be served upon the applicant 
by sending the same by certified mail addressed to the applicant at his 
last known address. The copy of the determination shall contain at the 
top thereof substantially the following statement: ``To all persons who, 
as operator, landlord, tenant, or sharecropper, are or will be 
interested in the above-named commodity on the farm identified below in 
the year for which the marketing quota being reviewed is established'' 
and such statement shall constitute notice to all such persons. The 
clerk shall make a notation on the original determination of the date 
and place of such mailing. The clerk forthwith shall forward two copies 
of such determination to the State office, and one copy to the county 
committee. The determination of the review committee does not become 
final until the period for reopening of hearing under Sec. 711.25 has 
expired without any reopening; or if reopened thereunder, such 
determination becomes final upon issuance of a new determination 
pursuant to the reopened hearing, subject to further appeal to a court 
by the applicant.


<R05>
Sec. 711.25  Reopening of hearing.

    (a) Upon motion of review committee. Upon its own motion within 15 
days from the date of mailing to the applicant of a copy of the 
determination of the review committee, the review committee may reopen a 
hearing for the purpose of taking additional evidence or of adding any 
relevant matter or document.
    (b) Upon written request based on new evidence. Upon written request 
by the applicant, the county committee, the State executive director, or 
other interested parties, to the review committee within 15 days from 
the date of mailing to the applicant of a copy of the determination of 
the review committee, the review committee shall reopen the hearing for 
the purpose of taking additional evidence or of adding any relevant 
matter or document if the review committee finds that such evidence or 
documents constitute new evidence not available to the parties at the 
time of the hearing.
    (c) Upon written notice by the Secretary. Upon written notice by the 
Secretary or on his behalf by the Deputy Administrator to the review 
committee within 45 days from the date of mailing to the applicant of a 
copy of the determination of the review committee on Form MQ-58, the 
hearing shall be deemed reopened and the State executive director shall 
schedule the reopened hearing.
    (d) Schedule of reopened hearing. Schedule of and notice of any 
reopened hearing shall follow the requirements of Secs. 711.18 and 
711.19 insofar as practicable. Notwithstanding the provisions of 
paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, no hearing shall be 
reopened after an appeal to a court pursuant to section 365 of the act 
has been timely filed by the applicant. No special hearing to contest a 
reopening of a hearing shall be scheduled; however, the applicant may

amended, or paragraph (3) of Pub. L. 74, 77th Congress, available for 
the refund of penalties initially collected which are subsequently 
adjusted downward by action of the county committee, review committee,

Sec. 717.2  Supervision of referenda and prescribed method of balloting.

    (a) Supervision of referenda. The Deputy Administrator shall be in 
charge of and responsible for conducting each referendum required by the 
Act. Each State committee shall be in charge of and responsible for 
conducting such referendum in its State. Each county committee shall be

<R05>
Sec. 717.3  Voting eligibility.

    (a) Statutory requirements--(1) Tobacco quotas proclaimed on an 
acreage basis under section 312(a) of the Act. Within 30 days after the 
proclamation under section 312(a) of the Act of national marketing 
quotas on an acreage basis for any kind of tobacco for the next 3 
succeeding marketing years, there shall be a referendum under section 
312(c) of the Act of farmers engaged in the production of the crop of 
such tobacco harvested immediately prior to the holding of the 
referendum to determine whether such farmers are in favor of or opposed 
to such quotas for the 3-year period. If more than one-third of the 
farmers voting oppose such quotas, the quotas so proclaimed for the 3-
year period shall not be in effect: Provided, That such referendum 
result shall not preclude the proclamation of national marketing quotas 
for such kind of tobacco for the next 3 succeeding marketing years 
subject to a referendum as required under this paragraph. If the 
referendum results in approval of quotas for the 3-year period, no 
further referendum applicable to such quotas shall be held (i) unless a 
new proclamation during the 3-year period is made pursuant to 
subdivision (3) of section 312(a) of the Act in which case a referendum 
shall be held as provided in this paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, 
or (ii) unless quotas on an acreage-poundage basis are established 
pursuant to section 317(c) of the Act, in which case a special 
referendum shall be held as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section.
    (2) Tobacco quotas proclaimed on an acreage-poundage basis under 
section 317(c) of the Act. During the first or second marketing year of 
the 3-year period for which marketing quotas for any kind of tobacco are 
in effect on an acreage basis, if the Secretary, under section 317(c) of 
the Act, determines that marketing quotas on an acreage-poundage basis 
would result in a more effective program, at the time of the next 
announcement of the amount of the marketing quota on an acreage basis, 
the Secretary shall also announce the national acreage allotment and 
national average yield goal. Within 45 days after such announcement of 
acreage-poundage quotas there shall be a special referendum under 
section 317(c) of the Act of farmers engaged in the production of the 
kind of tobacco of the most recent crop to determine

[[Page 67]]

whether such farmers favor the establishment of marketing quotas on an 
acreage-poundage basis for the next 3 marketing years. If more than two-
thirds of the farmers voting in the special referendum favor marketing 
quotas on an acreage-poundage basis, such quotas shall be in effect for 
the next 3 marketing years and the marketing quotas on an acreage basis 
shall cease to be in effect at the beginning of such 3-year period and 
no further special referendum applicable to such 3-year period shall be 
held. If marketing quotas on an acreage-poundage basis are not favored 
by more than two-thirds of the farmers voting in the special referendum, 
marketing quotas on an acreage basis as previously proclaimed shall 
continue in effect.
    (3) Tobacco quotas proclaimed on an acreage-poundage basis under 
section 317(d) of the Act. If marketing quotas on an acreage-poundage 
basis have been made effective for a kind of tobacco, the Secretary 
shall proclaim a national marketing quota for such kind of tobacco for 
the next 3 succeeding marketing years if the marketing year is the last 
year of 3 consecutive years for which marketing quotas previously 
proclaimed will be in effect. Such proclamation may be on an acreage-
poundage basis or on an acreage basis. Within 30 days after such 
proclamation, there shall be a referendum under section 312(c) of the 
Act of farmers engaged in the production of the crop of such kind of 
tobacco harvested immediately prior to the holding of the referendum to 
determine whether such farmers are in favor of or opposed to such quotas 
for the next 3 succeeding marketing years. If more than one-third of the 
farmers voting oppose such quotas, the quotas so proclaimed for the 3-
year period shall not be in effect: Provided, That such referendum 
result shall not preclude the proclamation of national marketing quotas 
for such kind of tobacco for the next 3 succeeding marketing years under 
section 312(a) of the Act subject to a referendum thereon as provided in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If a referendum results in approval of 
quotas for 3 marketing years on an acreage basis, no further referendum 
applicable to such 3 marketing years shall be held except as may be 
required under section 317(c) of the Act. If a referendum results in 
approval of quotas for 3 marketing years on an acreage-poundage basis, 
no further referendum applicable to such 3 marketing years shall be 
held.
    (4) Tobacco quotas proclaimed but disapproved in 3 successive years. 
Under section 312(a)(4) of the Act, if producers have disapproved 
national marketing quotas for a kind of tobacco in referenda held in 3 
successive years subsequent to 1952, a national marketing quota shall 
not be proclaimed for any marketing year within the 3-year period for 
which quotas were disapproved unless prior to November 10 of the 
marketing year, one-fourth or more of the farmers engaged in the 
production of the crop of tobacco harvested in the calendar year in 
which such marketing year begins petition the Secretary to proclaim a 
national marketing quota for each of the next 3 succeeding marketing 
years.
    (5) [Reserved]
    (6) Extra long staple cotton quotas. Not later than December 15 
following the proclamation of a national quota for extra long staple 
cotton there shall be a referendum under section 343 of the Act, of 
farmers engaged in the production of extra long staple cotton in the 
calendar year in which the referendum is held to determine whether such 
farmers are in favor of or opposed to the quota for the next marketing 
year. If more than one-third of the farmers voting in the referendum 
oppose the quota, such quota shall not be in effect.
    (7) [Reserved]
    (8) Rice quotas. Within 30 days after the proclamation of a national 
marketing quota for rice there shall be a referendum under section 
354(b) of the Act of farmers engaged in the production of the 
immediately preceding crop of rice to determine whether such farmers are 
in favor of or opposed to the quota for the next marketing year. If more 
than one-third of the farmers voting in the referendum oppose the quota, 
such quota shall not be in effect.
    (9) Peanut quotas. Not later than December 15 of each calendar year 
there shall be a referendum under section 358(b) of the Act of farmers 
engaged in

[[Page 68]]

the production of peanuts in the calendar year in which the referendum 
is held to determine whether such farmers are in favor of or opposed to 
marketing quotas with respect to the crops of peanuts produced in the 3 
calendar years immediately following the year in which the referendum is 
held. If more than one-third of the farmers voting in the referendum 
oppose such quotas, the quotas so proclaimed shall not be in effect: 
Provided, That such referendum result shall not preclude the 
proclamation of quotas in the next calendar year for a 3-year period 
subject to a referendum as required under this paragraph. If quotas are 
favored, no further referendum with respect to the 3-year period shall 
be held.
    (b) Farmers engaged in the production of a commodity. For purposes 
of referenda with respect to marketing quotas for tobacco, extra long 
staple cotton, rice and peanuts the phrase ``farmers engaged in the 
production of a commodity'' includes any person who is entitled to share 
in a crop of the commodity, or the proceeds thereof because he shares in 
the risks of production of the crop as an owner, landlord, tenant, or 
sharecropper (landlord whose return from the crop is fixed regardless of 
the amount of the crop produced is excluded) on a farm on which such 
crop is planted in a workmanlike manner for harvest: Provided, That any 
failure to harvest the crop because of conditions beyond the control of 
such person shall not affect his status as a farmer engaged in the 
production of the crop. In addition, the phrase ``farmers engaged in the 
production of a commodity'' also includes each person who it is 
determined would have had an interest as a producer in the commodity on 
a farm for which a farm allotment for the crop of the commodity was 
established and no acreage of the crop was planted but an acreage of the 
crop was regarded as planted for history acreage purposes under the 
applicable commodity regulations.
    (c) Special conditions applicable to peanuts and rice--(1) Peanuts. 
In the case of a referendum for marketing quotas for peanuts, farmers 
engaged in the production of peanuts as determined under paragraph (b) 
of this section shall not be eligible to vote in the referendum if the 
farm does not have any production of peanuts subject to marketing 
quotas. Under section 359(b) of the Act, marketing quotas are not 
applicable to peanuts produced on any farm on which the acreage 
harvested for nuts is 1 acre or less provided the producers who share in 
the peanuts produced on such farm do not share in the peanuts produced 
on any other farm. Under section 359(b) of the Act, marketing quotas are 
not applicable to peanuts which it is established (i) were not picked or 
threshed either before or after marketing from the farm, or (ii) were 
marketed by the producer before drying or removal of moisture from such 
peanuts either by natural or artificial means for consumption 
exclusively as boiled peanuts.
    (2) Rice. In the case of a referendum for a marketing quota for 
rice, farmers engaged in the production of rice as determined under 
paragraph (b) of this section shall not be eligible to vote in the 
referendum if the farm is not subject to marketing quotas. Under section 
353(d) of the Act, marketing quotas are not applicable (i) to 
nonirrigated rice produced on any farm on which the acreage planted to 
nonirrigated rice does not exceed 3 acres, or (ii) to rice produced

    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) One vote limitation. Each person eligible to vote in a 
particular marketing quota referendum shall be entitled to only one vote 
in such referendum regardless of the number of farms in which such 
person is interested or the number of communities, counties, or States 
in which farms are located in which farms such person is interested: 
Provided, That:
    (1) The individual members of a partnership shall each be entitled 
to one vote, but the partnership as an entity shall not be entitled to 
vote;
    (2) An individual eligible voter shall be entitled to one vote even 
though he is interested in an entity (including but not limited to a 
corporation) which entity is also eligible to vote;
    (3) A person shall also be entitled to vote in each instance of his 
capacity as a fiduciary (including but not limited to a guardian, 
administrator, executor or trustee) if in such fiduciary capacity

[[Page 69]]

he is eligible to vote but the person for whom he acts as a fiduciary 
shall not be eligible to vote.
    (f) Joint and family interest. Where several persons, such as 
members of a family, have participated or will participate in the 
production of a commodity under the same lease or cropping agreement, 
only the person or persons who signed the lease or agreement, or agreed 
to an oral lease or agreement, shall be eligible to vote. Where two or 
more persons have produced or will produce a commodity as joint tenants, 
tenants in common, or owners of community property, each such person 
shall be entitled to one vote if otherwise eligible. The eligibility of 
one spouse does not affect the eligibility of the other spouse.
    (g) Minors. A minor shall be entitled to one vote if he is otherwise 
eligible and is 18 years of age or older when he votes.
    (h) [Reserved]
    (i) Interpretation. In the case of any commodity on a farm where no 
acreage of the commodity is actually planted but an acreage of the 
commodity is regarded as planted under applicable regulations of the 
Department, persons on the farm who it is determined would have had an 
interest in the commodity as a producer if an acreage of the commodity 
had been actually planted shall be eligible to vote in the referendum.

Sec. 717.5  Community referendum committees.

    (a) Where one referendum is to be conducted. Except where the entire 
county is to be considered a referendum community, the county committee 
shall designate a community referendum committee for each referendum

community referendum committee shall be responsible for the proper 
holding of the referendum in its community in a fair, unbiased and 
impartial manner in accordance with this part. In counties where the 
entire county is treated as one referendum community, the county 
committee shall perform, in addition to its other duties, the duties of 
the community referendum committee.

more referenda are to be held in the county on the same day, the 
provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall be applicable except

to vote in any one or more of such referenda shall be used to determine 
whether there are 100 or

[[Page 70]]

more farms on which there are producers who are eligible to vote in the 
referenda, and (2) each community referendum committee shall be chosen 
from among the farmers who reside in the community and who are eligible 
to vote in any of such referenda or who are community committeemen 
elected pursuant to the regulations in the subpart--Selection and 
Functions of Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation County and 
Community committees (part 7 of this title).

ballot in secret and without coercion, duress, or interference of any 
sort whatsoever. Subject to the provisions of Sec. 717.9(c) for absentee 
ballots, a farmer or producer eligible to vote, shall vote only at a 
polling place designated for the referendum community in which he was 
engaged in the production of the commodity for which the referendum is

<R05>
Sec. 717.8  Notice of referendum.

    (a) Posting a notice. The county committee shall give public notice 
of the referendum in each referendum community by posting a notice at 
one or more places open to the public within such community prior to the 
date of the referendum. Such notice shall be on a form prescribed by the 
Deputy Administrator and shall state the commodity or commodities and 
marketing year, or years, or crops for which the referendum is to be 
held, the location of the polling place in the community, the date of 
the referendum, and the

[[Page 71]]

hours when the polls will be opened and closed. The county executive 
director is authorized to sign such notice on behalf of the county 
committee.
    (b) Use of agencies of public information. The county committee and 
community referendum committees shall utilize, to the extent practicable 
(without advertising expense), all available agencies of public 
information, including newspapers, radio, television and other means, to 
give persons in the county public notice of the day and hours of voting, 
the location of polling places, and the rules governing eligibility to 
vote. Such notice should be given as soon as practicable after the 
arrangements for holding the referendum in the county have been made.


<R05>
Sec. 717.9  Manner of voting.

    (a) Secret ballot. The voting in the referendum shall be by secret 
ballot. Each voter shall, at the time he is handed the form on which to 
cast his ballot, be instructed to mark his ballot form so as to indicate 
clearly how he votes and in such manner that no one else shall see how 
he votes and then to fold his ballot and place it in the ballot box 
without allowing anyone else to see how he voted. A suitable place where 
each voter may mark and cast his ballot in secret and without coercion, 
duress, or interference of any sort whatever, shall be provided in each 
polling place. Every unchallenged ballot shall be placed in the ballot 
box by the person who voted it. The fact that a voter fails to fold a 
ballot placed in the ballot box shall not invalidate it. It shall be the 
duty of each community referendum committee to see that no device of any 
sort whatever is used whereby any voter's ballot may be identified 
except as provided in this part in the case of a challenged ballot or an 
absentee ballot.
    (b) Voting by proxy prohibited. There shall be no voting by proxy or 
agent, or in any manner except by the eligible voter (or the challenged 
voter under paragraph (d) of this section) personally depositing in the 
ballot box his ballot as marked by him (except as provided in the case 
of an absentee ballot), but a duly authorized officer of a corporation, 
association, or other legal entity, may cast its vote.
    (c) Absentee ballots. Any person who will not be present on the day 
of the referendum in the county in which he is eligible to vote or who 
will be prevented from voting in person on the day of the referendum 
because of physical incapacity, or whose religious belief forbids him 
from voting on the day of the referendum, may obtain prior to the date 
of the referendum, one ballot from a State or county FSA office 
conveniently situated for him, or from the Commodity Programs Division, 
FSA, Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C., and cast an absentee 
ballot. The office so issuing the ballot form shall endorse on the 
reverse side thereof a statement in substantially the following form 
identifying the place in which it was issued and the county to which it 
will be mailed or delivered, initialed and dated by the person issuing 
such form.
    Issued in -------- County -------- State, or by ---------------- 
State FSA Office, or by ---------------- Division, FSA, Washington, 
D.C., for use in -------- County, -------- State.

The issuing office shall keep a register showing for each ballot form so 
issued by it to be voted absentee, the name and address to whom issued, 
the date of issuance, and the county and State in which the ballot is to 
be voted, and the name and title of the person who issued the ballot. 
The person to whom the ballot is issued shall mark the ballot so as to 
indicate clearly how he votes and place the ballot in a plain envelope 
which shall be marked clearly with the words ``Absentee Ballot,'' sealed 
and inserted in another envelope which shall be marked clearly with the 
voter's name and return address, sealed and delivered, or mailed, 
postage paid, to the county committee for the county in which he is 
eligible to vote. All absentee ballots must, in order to be accepted, 
reach the county office for the county in which the voter is eligible to 
vote by not later than the hour for closing the polls in the county on 
the day of the referendum. No such ballot shall be counted unless the 
voter's name and address appear on the envelope and it is determined 
that he is eligible to vote.

[[Page 72]]

    (d) Challenged ballots. The community referendum committee or any 
member thereof shall challenge the eligibility of any person to vote in 
the referendum where (1) the community referendum committee or any 
member thereof is unable to determine that the person is eligible to 
vote in the referendum in the community, or (2) the community referendum 
committee or any member thereof has reason to believe that such person 
has previously voted in the referendum in another community in the same 
or another county in person or by mail, or (3) the person's name and 
address have not been entered on the register of eligible voters, prior 
to its delivery to the referendum committee, unless the referendum 
committee is satisfied that the person is eligible to vote. In every 
case where the eligibility of the voter is challenged, his ballot form, 
after being marked by the challenged person so as to show how he votes, 
but in such manner that no one else sees how he votes, shall be folded 
and placed by him (or by a member of the committee if he refuses) in an 
envelope, which shall then be sealed and placed in another envelope, 
identified with his name and address, the word ``Challenged'' and a 
statement of the reason for the challenge, and shall then be placed in 
the ballot box. The county committee shall make an investigation in each 
case of controversy or dispute regarding the eligibility of a voter to 
vote in the referendum. In each case of a challenged ballot the 
eligibility of the person to vote in the referendum shall be determined 
by the county committee as soon as may be possible after the polls are 
closed and before the time for forwarding to the State committee the 
county summary of ballots. If it is determined that the person whose 
vote was challenged is eligible to vote, the sealed envelope containing 
the ballot shall be placed with the challenged ballot of every other 
person found to be eligible to vote until all challenged ballots have 
been passed upon by the county committee. If it is determined that the 
person whose vote was challenged is not eligible, the sealed envelope 
shall be marked ``Not eligible'' and signed by a member of the county 
committee and shall not be opened. When all of the challenged ballots 
have been passed upon by the county committee, the challenged ballots 
which were cast by eligible voters shall be opened and tabulated on the 
county summary of ballots, but no disclosure shall be made as to how any 
particular person voted.
    (e) Ballot box. Each polling place shall be furnished with a 
suitable ballot box. Any container of sufficient size so arranged that 
no ballot can be read or removed without breaking seals on the container 
will be suitable. When strip adhesive paper or corresponding seals are 
used on the ballot box, such seals shall be signed or initialed by the 
chairman or a member of the community referendum committee so that 
breaking or replacing the seal will so destroy or affect the identifying 
marks as to show that the seal has been tampered with.

<R05>
Sec. 717.10  Local arrangements for holding the referendum.

    The county committee shall make all arrangements for the proper 
holding of the referendum in accordance with this part prior to the date 
of the referendum. The county committee shall instruct each community 
referendum committee concerning its duties so that each member of the 
committee understands his duties and the duties of the committee in all 
respects, with particular emphasis as to (a) issuing ballot forms, (b) 
challenged ballots, (c) recording votes, (d) tabulating ballots, and (e) 
certifying results of the referendum in the referendum community. The 
county executive director shall furnish each community referendum 
committee an adequate supply of forms prior to the time the polls in the 
county are opened for the acceptance of ballots, by delivering the 
ballot forms and the forms for the community summary of ballots to each 
chairman of the several community referendum committees.


<R05>
Sec. 717.11  Issuing ballots.

    The community referendum committee shall open the polling place for 
the issuance of ballot forms and the casting of ballots at the time 
designated and shall thereafter until the

[[Page 73]]

time when the polls are required to be closed and the casting of ballots 
discontinued issue a ballot to each person who is eligible to vote and 
applies for a ballot and to each person who claims to be eligible to 
vote and insists upon voting even though his eligibility to vote is 
challenged by a member of the committee. The community referendum 
committeeman who issued the ballot form shall immediately enter on the 
register of voters opposite the name and address of the person voting, a 
record of the issuance of the ballot, the casting of the ballot, and any 
challenge of the eligibility of the person casting the ballot. Ballot 
forms shall be issued and ballots placed in the ballot box while at 
least two members serving on the community referendum committee are 
physically present in the polling place and in position to see each 
ballot form as it is issued and each ballot as it is placed in the 
ballot box.


<R05>
Sec. 717.12  Community referendum committee's canvass of ballots.

    Immediately after the polls are closed, the community referendum 
committee shall open the ballot box and canvass the ballots cast. The 
canvass of the ballots shall be kept open to the public. A ballot shall 
be considered as a spoiled ballot if it is mutilated or marked in such a 
way that it is not possible to determine with certainty how the ballot 
was intended to be counted on a particular question. The envelope 
containing the challenged ballots shall not be opened. The total number 
of ballots issued as shown on the register of voters shall be determined 
and the total number of ballots cast, including the spoiled and 
challenged ballots, shall be determined. The number of ballots cast in 
favor of and the number of ballots cast in opposition to the question on 
which the referendum was held shall be determined. The spoiled ballots 
and challenged ballots shall not be considered in favor of or against 
the question. If any member of the community referendum committee should 
see or learn how any person besides himself voted, whether or not the 
ballot was challenged, spoiled, or otherwise, he shall not disclose such 
knowledge to a fellow committeeman or any other person except in an 
investigation conducted under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 717.13  Community committee's reporting and record of results of referendum.

    The community referendum committee shall notify the county committee 
by telephone, telegraph, messenger, or in person of the preliminary 
count of the votes on each question and of the number of spoiled and 
challenged ballots, as soon as may be possible. All the spoiled ballots 
shall be placed in an envelope and sealed and marked with the initials 
of the chairman (or vice chairman) of the community referendum committee 
and the designation ``Spoiled Ballots'' followed by the number of 
spoiled ballots and the names of the community, the county and the 
State. The community referendum committee shall execute the 
certification as to the accuracy of the register of eligible voters and 
ballots cast. The community referendum committee shall then prepare and 
execute the community summary of ballots and post one copy thereof, as 
soon as it is executed, in a conspicuous place at the polling place, so 
that it will remain posted and accessible to the public for at least 3 
calendar days after the holding of the referendum. The community 
referendum committee shall seal the voted ballots, including those 
challenged and spoiled, the register of eligible voters and ballots 
cast, and the community summary of ballots, in one or more envelopes 
appropriately identified by the names of the community, the county, and 
the State, and the nature of the referendum and the date on which it was 
held, and deliver them to the county committee not later than 9 a.m., 
local time, on the second calendar day after the date of the referendum, 
together with the unused ballot and other forms. The chairman (or vice 
chairman) of the community referendum committee shall be responsible for 
the safe delivery of such reports, ballots, and forms to the county 
committee.

[[Page 74]]


<R05>
Sec. 717.14  County committee's canvass of ballots.

    The county committee, after the closing of the polls, shall open and 
canvass the absentee ballots received and determine the eligibility of 
each voter. If any person voting absentee is found to be ineligible to 
vote, or the ballot is so mutilated or marked that it is not possible to 
determine with certainty how the person intended to vote, such ballot 
shall not be counted as for or against the question in the referendum. 
The county committee shall meet and pass upon the challenged ballots as 
soon as may be reasonably possible after the challenged ballots are 
received from the community referendum committees, but not later than 4 
calendar days after the day of the referendum. The result of the 
referendum in each community shall be reviewed and summarized as soon as 
may be reasonably possible after the records, ballots, and forms are 
received from the several community referendum committees. Every meeting 
of the county committee for the purpose of canvassing the ballots cast 
and reviewing and tabulating the results of the referendum shall be open 
to the public. No member of the county committee who learns how any 
person besides himself voted, whether the ballot was an absentee ballot, 
challenged, spoiled, or otherwise, shall disclose such knowledge to any 
fellow committeeman or other person except in an investigation conducted 
under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 717.15  County committee's reporting and record of results of the referendum.

    The county committee shall notify the State committee by telephone, 
telegraph, or messenger (who may be a member of the county committee), 
as to the preliminary count of the votes on each question and the number 
of challenged ballots by the several community referendum committees as 
soon as possible. The county committee shall, as soon as may be 
reasonably possible, but in no event later than 4 calendar days after 
the date of the referendum, have prepared and certified the county 
summary of ballots. Such summary shall be prepared and certified in 
triplicate, one copy of which shall be sent to the State committee, one 
copy posted for 30 calendar days in a conspicuous place accessible to 
the public in or near the office of the county committee, and one copy 
filed in the office of the county committee and kept available for 
public inspection. One copy of each community summary shall likewise be 
posted for 30 calendar days in a conspicuous place accessible to the 
public in or near the office of the county committee.


<R05>
Sec. 717.16  Investigation as to correctness of summary of the referendum.

    The county committee shall make an investigation in each case of a 
dispute or challenge regarding the correctness of the summary of the 
referendum in a community. No dispute or challenge shall be investigated 
by the county committee unless it is brought to its attention within 3 
calendar days after the date on which the referendum was held. The 
county committee shall promptly decide the dispute or the challenge and 
report its findings to the State committee within 5 calendar days after 
the holding of the referendum and send by certified mail, or deliver in 
person, to the office of the State committee all voted ballots, register 
forms, and community summary sheets involved in the dispute or 
challenge.


<R05>
Sec. 717.17  State committee's reporting and record of result of the referendum.

    The State committee for each State shall notify the Deputy 
Administrator by telegraph or telephone as to the preliminary count of 
the votes in the State as soon as the preliminary results of the 
referendum are made known to the State committee. The county summaries 
of ballots shall be summarized on the State summary of ballots as soon 
as possible, but in no event later than 7 calendar days after the date 
of the referendum, unless there is a dispute or challenge regarding the 
correctness of the summary for any county, in which case the State 
committee shall complete its investigation thereof, decide the dispute 
or challenge, and prepare the State summary accordingly within 14 
calendar

[[Page 75]]

days after the date of the referendum. The State summary shall be 
prepared in triplicate and certified to by the State executive director. 
The original and one copy of the State summary shall be forwarded to the

<R05>
Sec. 717.18  Issuing ballots.

    The county committee shall furnish each person who is eligible to 
vote in a particular referendum a ballot suitable for mailing back to 
the office of the county committee. If a person who is eligible to vote

address, the county and State in which the ballot is to be voted, and 
the name and title of the person who issued the ballot.

Sec. 717.21  Canvassing voted ballots.

    (a) Time of canvassing. The canvassing of voted ballots shall take 
place at the opening of the county office on the fifth day after the 
close of the referendum period. Ballots received after the start of 
tabulation, even though contained in envelopes that were post-marked 
prior to midnight of the final day of the referendum period, shall not 
be counted.
    (b) Canvassing by county committee. The canvassing shall be in the 
presence of at least two members of the county committee and open to the 
public: Provided, That if two or more counties have been combined and 
are served by one county office, the canvassing of ballots shall be 
conducted by at least one member of the county committee from each 
county served by the county office: Provided further, That the State 
committee, or the State executive director if authorized by the State 
committee, may (1) designate the county executive director and a county 
or State FSA office employee to canvass the ballots and report the 
results, as provided in paragraph (c) and Sec. 717.22, instead of two 
members of the county committee, when it is determined that the number 
of eligible voters for the commodity for which the referendum is being 
conducted is so limited that having two members of the county committee 
present for this function is impractical and (2) designate the county 
Executive Director and/or another county or State FSA office employee to 
canvass ballots in any emergency situation precluding at least two 
members of the county committee from being present to carry out the 
functions required in this section.
    (c) Manner of canvassing. The canvassing of ballots shall follow the 
following procedure:
    (1) The ballot box shall be opened;
    (2) The envelopes from the ballot box shall be separated into three 
groups consisting of (i) unopened certification envelopes which do not 
have a proper signed certification, (ii) unopened certification 
envelopes from ineligible voters, and (iii) unopened certification 
envelopes from eligible voters;
    (3) The unopened certification envelopes from eligible voters shall 
be opened and plain envelopes removed and then shuffled to preserve the 
secrecy of the ballots contained in such plain envelopes;
    (4) The ballots shall be removed from such plain envelopes and 
tabulated. A ballot shall be considered as a spoiled ballot if it is 
mutilated or marked in such a way that it is not possible to determine 
with certainty how the ballot was intended to be counted on a particular 
question. The spoiled ballots shall not be considered in favor of or 
against the question.
    (5) The unopened certification envelopes which do not have a proper 
signed certification shall not be opened and shall not be considered in 
favor of or against the question.
    (6) The unopened certification envelopes from ineligible voters 
shall be considered as challenged ballots. The county committee shall 
determine the eligibility of the person to vote in the referendum. If 
determined to be eligible such envelopes shall be handled as provided 
under paragraphs (c)(3) and (4) of this section. If determined not to be 
eligible, such envelopes shall not be opened and shall not be considered 
in favor of or against the question.
    (d) Dispute or challenge. A dispute or challenge with respect to any 
referendum held by mail ballot shall not be considered unless 
notification of such dispute or challenge is filed in writing with the 
county executive director of the county in which the alleged 
irregularity occurred within 3 days after the date of the canvassing of 
voted ballots. Such written notification of a dispute or challenge must 
identify each alleged instance in which the county committee erred when 
canvassing the ballots or tabulating the referendum results. The county 
committee shall determine the validity of the dispute or challenge and 
report its findings to the State committee within 3 working days after 
the final date for filing a dispute or challenge.

dispute or challenge, and prepare the State summary accordingly within 
14 calendar days after canvassing of the ballots. The State summary 
shall be prepared in triplicate and certified to by the State executive 
director. The original and one copy of the State summary shall be

Sec. 718.7  Failure to fully comply.

    In any case in which the failure of a producer to fully comply with 
the terms and conditions of a program authorized by this chapter 
precludes the making of price support to such producer, the Deputy 
Administrator for Farm Programs may authorize the making of such price 
support in such amounts as determined to be equitable in relation to the 
seriousness of the failure if the regulations of this title authorizing 
the program specifically authorize such action. The provisions of this

           Subpart B--Determination Of Acreage and Compliance


<R05>
Sec. 718.101  Measurements.

    (a) Measurement services include, but are not limited to, measuring 
land and crop areas, quantities of farm-stored commodities, and 
appraising the yields of crops when required for program administration 
purposes. The county committee shall provide measurement service if the 
producer requests such service and pays the cost, except that service 
shall not be provided to determine total acreage of a crop when the 
request is made:
    (1) After the established final reporting date for the applicable 
crop except as provided in Sec. 718.103;.
    (2) After the farm operator has furnished the county office 
production evidence when required for program administration purposes 
except as provided in this subpart; or
    (3) In connection with a late-filed report of acreage, unless there 
is evidence of the existence and use made of the crop, the lack of the 
crop or a disaster condition affecting the crop.
    (b) The acreage requested to be measured by staking and referencing 
shall not exceed the effective farm allotment for marketing quota crops 
or acreage of a crop that is limited to a specific number of acres to 
meet any program requirement.
    (c) When a producer requests, pays for, and receives written notice 
that measurement services have been furnished, the measured acreage 
shall be guaranteed to be correct and used for all program purposes for 
the current year even though an error is later discovered in the 
measurement thereof, if the producer has taken action with an economic 
significance based on the measurement service, and the entire crop 
required for the farm was measured. If the producer has not taken action 
with an economic significance based on the measurement service, the 
producer shall be notified in writing that an error was discovered and 
the nature and extent of such error. In such cases, the corrected 
acreage will be used for determining program compliance for the current 
year.
    (d) When a measurement service reveals acreage in excess of the 
permitted acreage by more than the allowable tolerance, the producer 
must destroy the excess acreage and pay for an authorized employee of 
FSA to verify destruction, in order to keep the measurement service 
guarantee.


<R05>
Sec. 718.102  Acreage reports.

    (a) In order to be eligible for benefits, participants in the

this title must report the use of the land enrolled in such programs;
    (4) Participants in the programs authorized by parts 723 and 1464 of 
this title must report the acreage planted to tobacco by kind on all 
farms that have an effective allotment or quota greater than zero; 
provided further that for burley tobacco each person who owns a farm for 
which a burley quota is established must report the acreage planted to 
burley tobacco, including instances in which the acres planted are zero 
acres; and
    (5) Participants in the programs authorized by parts 729 and 1446 of 
this title must report the acreage planted to peanuts by type.

[[Page 87]]

    (c) The reports required under paragraph (a) of this section shall 
be timely filed by the farm operator, farm owner, or a duly authorized 
representative with the county committee by the final reporting date 
applicable to the crop as established by the county committee and State 
committee.
    (d) Peanut producers shall provide the county office evidence of 
disposition of any peanuts that are kept on the farm, including:

<R05>
Sec. 718.103  Late-filed reports.

    (a) A farm operator's report may be accepted after the established 
date for reporting if evidence is still available for inspection which 
may be used to make a determination with respect to the existence and 
use made of the crop, the lack of the crop or a disaster condition 
affecting the crop.
    (b) The farm operator shall pay the cost of a farm visit by an 
authorized FSA employee unless the County Committee has determined that 
failure to report in a timely manner was beyond the producer's control.


<R05>
Sec. 718.104  Revised reports.

    (a) The farm operator may revise a report of acreage with respect to 
1996 and subsequent years to change the acreage reported if the county 
committee determines that the revision does not have an adverse impact 
on the program and the acreage has not already been determined by FSA.
    (b) Revised reports shall be filed and accepted:
    (1) At any time for all crops if evidence exists for inspection and 
determination of the existence and use made of the crop, the lack of the 
crop, or a disaster condition affecting the crop; and
    (2) If the requirements of paragraph (a) have been met and the 
producer was in compliance with all other program requirements by the 
applicable established crop reporting date.


<R05>
Sec. 718.105  Tolerances, variances, and adjustments for tobacco and peanuts.

    (a) Tolerance or variance for tobacco and peanuts is the amount by 
which the determined acreage may differ from the reported acreage or 
allotment and still be considered in compliance with program 
requirements. Tolerance or variance for tobacco is the amount by which 
the determined acreage may differ from the reported acreage or allotment 
and still be considered in compliance with program requirements.
    (b) Tolerance rules apply to those fields for which a staking and 
referencing was performed but such acreage was not planted according to 
those measurements or when a measurement service is not requested for 
acreage destroyed to meet program requirements. Tolerance rules do not 
apply to:
    (1) Official fields when the entire field is devoted to one crop;
    (2) Those fields for which staking and referencing was performed and 
such acreage was planted according to those measurements; or
    (3) The adjusted acreage for farms using measurement after planting 
which have a determined acreage greater than the marketing quota crop 
allotment.
    (c) An administrative variance is applicable to all marketing quota 
crop acreages. Marketing quota crop acreages as determined in accordance 
with this part shall be deemed in compliance with the effective farm 
allotment or program requirement when the determined acreage does not 
exceed the effective farm allotment by more than an administrative 
variance determined as follows:
    (1) For all kinds of tobacco subject to marketing quotas, except 
dark air-cured and fire-cured the larger of 0.1 acre or 2 percent of the 
allotment; and

[[Page 88]]

    (2) For dark air-cured and fire-cured tobacco, an acreage based on 
the effective acreage allotment as provided in the table as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                          Administrative
    Effective acreage allotment is within this range         variance
------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.01 to 0.99............................................           0.01
1.00 to 1.49............................................           0.02
1.50 to 1.99............................................           0.03
2.00 to 2.49............................................           0.04
2.50 to 2.99............................................           0.05
3.00 to 3.49............................................           0.06
3.50 to 3.99............................................           0.07
4.00 to 4.49............................................           0.08
4.50 and up.............................................           0.09
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) A tolerance applies to tobacco other than flue-cured or burley, 
if the determined acreage exceeds the allotment by more than the 
administrative variance but by not more than the tolerance. Such excess 
acreage of tobacco may be adjusted to the effective farm acreage 
allotment to avoid marketing quota penalties or receive price support.
    (e) Tolerance for peanuts is the larger of 1.0 acre or 5 percent of 
the reported acreage, not to exceed 10.0 acres.

<R05>
Sec. 718.106  Acreages.

    (a) If an acreage has been established by a representative of FSA 
for an area delineated on an aerial photograph, such acreage will be 
recognized by the county committee as the official acreage for the area 
until such time as the boundaries of such area are changed. When 
boundaries not visible on the aerial photograph are established from 
data furnished by the producer, such acreage shall not be recognized as 
official acreage until the boundaries are verified by an authorized 
representative of FSA.
    (b) Measurements of any row crop shall extend beyond the planted 
area by the larger of 15 inches or one-half the distance between the 
rows.
    (c) The entire acreage of a field or subdivision of a field devoted 
to a crop shall be considered as devoted to the crop subject to any 
allowable deduction or adjustment credit except as otherwise provided in 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 718.107  Measuring acreage including skip row acreage.

    (a) When one crop is alternating with another crop, whether or not 
both crops have the same growing season, only the acreage that is 
actually planted to the crop being measured will be considered to be 
acreage devoted to the measured crop.
    (b) Subject to the provisions of this paragraph and section, whether 
planted in a skip row pattern or without a pattern of skipped rows, the 
entire acreage of the field or subdivision may be considered as devoted 
to the crop only where the distance between the rows, for all rows, is 
40 inches or less. If there is a skip that creates idle land wider than 
40 inches, or if the distance between any rows is more than 40 inches, 
then the area planted to the crop shall be considered to be that area 
which would represent the smaller of: a 40-inch width between rows, or 
the normal row spacing in the field for all other rows in the field--
those that are not more than 40 inches apart. The allowance for 
individual rows would be made based on the smaller of: actual spacing 
between those rows, or the normal spacing in the field. For example, if 
the crop is planted in single wide rows that are 48 inches apart, only 
20 inches to either side of each row (for a total of 40 inches between 
the two rows) could, at a maximum, be considered as devoted as the crop 
and normal spacing in the field would control. Half the normal distance 
between rows will also be allowed beyond the outside planted rows not to 
exceed 20 inches and will reflect normal spacing in the field.
    (c) In making calculations under this section, further reductions 
may be made in the acreage considered planted to the extent it is 
determined that the acreage is more sparsely planted than would be 
normal using reasonable and customary full production planting 
techniques.
    (d) The Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs has the discretionary 
authority to allow row allowances other than those specified in this 
section in those instances in which crops are normally planted with 
spacings greater or less than 40 inches, such as in the case of tobacco, 
or where other

[[Page 89]]

circumstances are presented which the Deputy Administrator finds 
justifies that allowance.
    (e) Paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section shall apply with 
respect to the 2003 and subsequent crops. For preceding crops, the rules 
in effect on January 1, 2002, shall apply.

[67 FR 71798, Dec. 3, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 718.108  Deductions.

    (a) Any contiguous area which is not devoted to the crop being 
measured and which is not part of a skip-row pattern under Sec. 718.107 
shall be deducted from the acreage of the crop if such area meets the 
following minimum national standards or requirements:
    (1) A minimum width of 30 inches;
    (2) For tobacco, three-hundredths acre, except that turn areas, 
terraces, permanent irrigation and drainage ditches, sod waterways, 
noncropland, and subdivision boundaries each of which is at least 30 
inches in width may be combined to meet the 0.03-acre minimum 
requirement; or
    (3) For all other crops and land uses, one-tenth acre. Turn areas, 
terraces, permanent irrigation and drainage ditches, sod waterways, 
noncropland, and subdivision boundaries each of which is at least 30 
inches in width and each of which contain 0.1 acre or more may be 
combined to meet any larger minimum prescribed for a State in accordance 
with this subpart.
    (b) If the area not devoted to the crop is located within the 
planted area, the part of any perimeter area that is more than 33 links 
in width will be considered to be an internal deduction if the standard 
deduction is used.
    (c) A standard deduction of 3 percent of the area devoted to a row 
crop and zero percent of the area devoted to a close-sown crop may be 
used in lieu of measuring the acreage of turn areas.


<R05>
Sec. 718.109  Adjustments.

    (a) The farm operator or other interested producer having excess 
tobacco acreage (other than flue-cured or burley) may adjust an acreage 
of the crop in order to avoid a marketing quota penalty if such person:
    (1) Notifies the county committee of such election within 15 
calendar days after the date of mailing of notice of excess acreage by 
the county committee; and
    (2) Pays the cost of a farm visit to determine the adjusted acreage 
prior to the date the farm visit is made.
    (b) The farm operator may adjust an acreage of tobacco (except flue-
cured and burley) by disposing of such excess tobacco prior to the 
marketing of any of the same kind of tobacco from the farm. The 
disposition shall be witnessed by a representative of FSA and may take 
place before, during, or after the harvesting of the same kind of 
tobacco grown on the farm. However, no credit will be allowed toward the 
disposition of excess acreage after the tobacco is harvested but prior 
to marketing, unless the county committee determines that such tobacco 
is representative of the entire crop from the farm of the kind of 
tobacco involved.


<R05>
Sec. 718.110  Notice of measured acreage.

    Written notice of measured acreage shall be on Form FSA-468, Notice 
of Determined Acreage, when mailed to the farm operator and shall 
constitute notice to all interested producers on the farm.


<R05>
Sec. 718.111  Redetermination.

    (a) A redetermination of crop acreage, appraised yield, or farm-
stored production for a farm may be initiated by the county committee, 
State committee, or Deputy Administrator at any time. Such 
redeterminations may also be initiated by a producer who has an interest 
in the farm upon filing a request within 15 calendar days after the date 
of the notice furnished the farm operator in accordance with 
Sec. 718.109 or Sec. 718.110 or within 5 calendar days after the initial 
appraisal of the yield of a crop or before any of the farm-stored 
production is removed from storage and upon payment of the cost of 
making such redetermination. A redetermination shall be undertaken in 
the manner prescribed by the Deputy Administrator. Such redetermination 
shall be used in lieu of any prior determination.
    (b) The county committee shall refund the payment of the cost for a 
redetermination when, because of an error in the initial determination:

[[Page 90]]

    (1) The appraised yield is changed by at least the larger of:
    (i) Five percent or 5 pounds for cotton;
    (ii) Five percent or 1 bushel for wheat, barley, oats, and rye; or
    (iii) Five percent or 2 bushels for corn and grain sorghum; or
    (2) The farm stored production is changed by at least the smaller of 
3 percent or 600 bushels; or
    (3) The acreage of the crop is:
    (i) Changed by at least the larger of 3 percent or 0.5 acre; or
    (ii) Considered to be within program requirements.


<R04>
  Subpart C--Reconstitution of Farms, Allotments, Quotas, and Acreages


<R05>
Sec. 718.201  Farm constitution.

    (a) Land which has been properly constituted under prior regulations 
shall remain so constituted until a reconstitution is required under 
paragraph (c) of this section. The constitution and identification of 
land as a farm for the first time and the subsequent reconstitution of a 
farm made hereafter, shall include all land operated by one person as a 
single farming unit except that it shall not include:
    (1) After August 1, 1996, land subject to a production flexibility 
contract with land not subject to a production flexibility contract;
    (2) Land under separate ownership unless the owners agree in 
writing;
    (3) Land under a lease agreement of less than 1 year duration;
    (4) Land in different counties when the tobacco allotments or quotas 
established for the land involved cannot be transferred from one county 
to another county by lease, sale, or owner. However, this paragraph 
shall not apply if:
    (i) All of the land is owned by one person and operated by one 
person and all such land is contiguous;
    (ii) Two or more tracts are located in counties that are contiguous 
in the same State and are owned by the same person if:
    (A) A burley or flue-cured tobacco quota is established for one or 
more of the tracts; and
    (B) The county committee determines that the tracts will be operated 
as a single farming unit as set forth in Sec. 718.202; or
    (iii) Because of a change in operation, tracts or parts of tracts 
will be divided from the parent farm that currently has land in more 
than one county, and there is no change in operation and ownership of 
the remainder of the farm, or if there is a change in ownership, the new 
owner agrees in writing to the constitution of the farm.
    (5) Federally owned land;
    (6) State-owned wildlife land unless the former owner has possession 
of the land under a leasing agreement;
    (7) Land constituting a farm which is declared ineligible to be 
enrolled in a program under the regulations governing the program;
    (8) For land subject to production flexibility contracts, land 
located in counties that are not contiguous. However, this subparagraph 
shall not apply if:
    (i) Counties are divided by a river;
    (ii) Counties do not touch because of a correction line adjustment; 
or
    (iii) The land is within 20 miles, by road, of other land that will 
be a part of the farming unit; and
    (9) With respect to peanut poundage quotas, land across:
    (i) County lines when the quotas established for the land involved 
cannot be transferred; or
    (ii) State lines.
    (b)(1) If all land on the farm is physically located in one county, 
the farm records shall be administratively located in such county. If 
there is no FSA office in the county or the county offices have been 
consolidated, the farm shall be administratively located in the 
contiguous county most convenient for the farm operator.
    (2) If the land on the farm is located in more than one county, the 
farm shall be administratively located in either of such counties as the 
county committees and the farm operator agree. If no agreement can be 
reached, the farm shall be administratively located in the county where 
the principal dwelling is situated, or where the major portion of the 
farm is located if there is no dwelling.

[[Page 91]]

    (c) A reconstitution of a farm either by division or by combination 
shall be required whenever:
    (1) A change has occurred in the operation of the land after the 
last constitution or reconstitution and as a result of such change the 
farm does not meet the conditions for constitution of a farm as set 
forth in paragraph (b) except that no reconstitution shall be made if 
the county committee determines that the primary purpose of the change 
in operation is to establish eligibility to transfer allotments subject 
to sale or lease;
    (2) The farm was not properly constituted under the applicable 
regulations in effect at the time of the last constitution or 
reconstitution;
    (3) An owner requests in writing that the owner's land no longer be 
included in a farm which is composed of tracts under separate ownership;
    (4) The county committee determines that the farm was reconstituted 
on the basis of false information furnished by the owner or farm 
operator;
    (5) The county committee determines that the tracts of land included 
in a farm are not being operated as a single farming unit;
    (6) An owner of a farm, constituted as a single farming unit prior 
to 1978, which is comprised of land located in two or more counties for 
which there is a quota or allotment established for such farm and such 
quota or allotment is subject to lease and transfer restrictions across 
county lines, requests in writing that the farm be reconstituted by 
dividing the tracts. The resulting farms shall be administratively 
serviced by the county office serving the county in which the land is 
geographically located; or
    (7) Land is sold for or devoted to nonagricultural commercial or 
industrial uses; however, a reconstitution is not required and 
allotments, quotas and acreages may remain with the farm if either of 
the following apply:
    (i) The land is already devoted to residential, recreational, 
industrial or commercial buildings; or
    (ii) The owner would qualify to use the landowner designation method 
of division in accordance with Sec. 718.205 or the allotments and quotas 
can be transferred by sale or owner in accordance with this part and 
parts 723 or 729 of this chapter and the owner of the parent farm and 
the purchaser file a signed written memorandum of understanding before 
Form FSA-476 or Form MQ-24 is issued, stating that the land will be 
devoted immediately or within 3 years to:
    (1) Nonagricultural commercial uses; or
    (2) Recreational, residential, industrial or non-farm commercial 
uses.
    (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (c)(1) through 
(c)(7), a reconstitution shall not be approved if the county committee 
determines that the primary purpose of the reconstitution is to:
    (1) Circumvent the provisions of part 12 of this title; or
    (2) Circumvent any other chapter of this title.

<R05>
Sec. 718.202  Determining the land constituting a farm.

    (a) In determining the constitution of a farm, consideration shall 
be given to provisions such as ownership and operation. For purposes of 
this part, the following rules shall be applicable to determining what 
land is to be included in a farm.
    (b) A minor shall be considered to be the same owner or operator as 
the parent or court-appointed guardian (or other person responsible for 
the minor child) unless:
    (1) The minor child is a producer on a farm;
    (2) Neither the minor's parents nor guardian has any interest in the 
minor's farm or production from the farm;
    (3) The minor establishes and maintains a separate household from 
the parent or guardian;
    (4) Personally carries out the farming activities in the operation; 
and
    (5) Maintains a separate accounting for the farming operation.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, a minor shall not 
be considered to be the same owner or operator as the parent or court-
appointed guardian if the minor's interest in the farming operation 
results from being the beneficiary of an irrevocable trust

[[Page 92]]

and ownership of the property is vested in the trust or the minor.
    (d) A life estate tenant shall be considered to be the owner of the 
property for their life.
    (e) A trust shall be considered to be an owner with the beneficiary 
of the trust; except a trust can be considered a separate owner or 
operator from the beneficiary, if the trust:
    (1) Has a separate and distinct interest in the land or crop 
involved;
    (2) Exercises separate responsibility for the separate and distinct 
interest; and
    (3) Maintains funds and accounts separate from that of any other 
individual or entity for the interest.


<R05>
Sec. 718.203  County committee action to reconstitute a farm.

    Action to reconstitute a farm may be initiated by the county 
committee, the farm owner, or the operator with the concurrence of the 
owner of the farm. Any request for a farm reconstitution shall be filed 
with the county committee.


<R05>
Sec. 718.204  Reconstitution of allotments, quotas, and acreages.

    (a) Farms shall be reconstituted in accordance with this subpart 
when it is determined that the land areas are not properly constituted 
and, to the extent practicable, shall be based on the facts and 
conditions existing at the time the change requiring the reconstitution 
occurred.
    (b) Reconstitutions of farms subject to a production flexibility 
contract in accordance with part 1412 of this title will be effective 
for the current year if initiated on or before July 1 of the fiscal 
year.
    (c) For tobacco and peanut farms, a reconstitution will be effective 
for the current year for each crop for which the reconstitution is 
initiated before the planting of such crop begins or would have begun.
    (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) and (c) of this 
section, a reconstitution may be effective for the current year if the 
county committee, with the concurrence of the State committee, 
determines that the purpose of the request for reconstitution is not to 
perpetrate a scheme or device the effect of which is to avoid the 
statutes and regulations governing commodity programs found in this 
title.


<R05>
Sec. 718.205  Rules for determining farms, allotments, quotas, and acreages when reconstitution is made by division.

    (a) The methods for dividing farms, allotments, quotas, and acreages 
in order of precedence, when applicable, are estate, designation by 
landowner, contribution, agricultural use, cropland, and history. The 
proper method shall be determined on a crop by crop basis.
    (b)(1) The estate method is the proration of allotments, quotas, and 
acreages for a parent farm among the heirs in settling an estate. If the 
estate sells a tract of land before the farm is divided among the heirs, 
the allotments, quotas, and acreages for that tract shall be determined 
by using one of the methods provided in paragraphs (c) through (g) of 
this section.
    (2) Allotments, quotas, and acreages shall be divided in accordance 
with a will, but only if the county committee determines that the terms 
of the will are such that a division can reasonably be made by the 
estate method.
    (3) If there is no will or the county committee determines that the 
terms of a will are not clear as to the division of allotments, quotas, 
and acreages, such allotments, quotas, and acreages shall be apportioned 
in the manner agreed to in writing by all interested heirs or devisees 
who acquire an interest in the property for which such allotments, 
quotas, and acreages have been established. An agreement by the 
administrator or executor shall not be accepted in lieu of an agreement 
by the heirs or devisees.
    (4) If allotments, quotas, and acreages are not apportioned in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this 
section, the allotments, quotas, and acreages shall be divided pursuant 
to paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section, as applicable.
    (c)(1) If the ownership of a tract of land is transferred from a 
parent farm, the transferring owner may request that the county 
committee divide the allotments, quotas, and acreages, including 
historical acreage that has

[[Page 93]]

been doublecropped, between the parent farm and the transferred tract, 
or between the various tracts if the entire farm is sold to two or more 
purchasers, in a manner designated by the owner of the parent farm 
subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. 
In the case of land subject to a Wetlands Reserve Program easement or 
Emergency Wetlands Reserve Program easement, the parent farm shall 
retain the allotments, quotas, and acreages.
    (2) If the county committee determines that allotments, quotas, and 
acreages cannot be divided in the manner designated by the owner because 
of the conditions set forth in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the 
owner shall be notified and permitted to revise the designation so as to 
meet the conditions in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. If the owner 
does not furnish a revised designation of allotments, quotas, and 
acreages within a reasonable time after such notification, or if the 
revised designation does not meet the conditions of paragraph (c)(4) of 
this section, the county committee will prorate the allotments, quotas, 
and acreages in accordance with paragraphs (d) through (g) of this 
section.
    (3) If a parent farm is composed of tracts, under separate 
ownership, each separately owned tract being transferred in part shall 
be considered a separate farm and shall be constituted separately from 
the parent farm using the rules in paragraphs (d) through (g) of this 
section, as applicable, prior to application of the provisions of this 
paragraph.
    (4) A landowner may designate, as provided in this paragraph, the 
manner in which allotments, quotas, and acreages are divided.
    (i) The transferring owner and transferee shall file a signed 
written memorandum of understanding of the designation with the county 
committee before the farm is reconstituted and before a subsequent 
transfer of ownership of the land. The landowner shall designate the 
allotments, quotas, and acreage that shall be permanently reduced when 
the sum of the allotments, quotas, and acreages exceeds the cropland for 
the farm.
    (ii) Where the part of the farm from which the ownership is being 
transferred was owned for a period of less than 3 years, the designation 
by landowner method shall not be available with respect to the transfer 
unless the county committee determines that the primary purpose of the 
ownership transfer was other than to retain or to sell allotments or 
quotas. In the absence of such a determination, and if the farm contains 
land which has been owned for less than 3 years, that part of the farm 
which has been owned for less than 3 years shall be considered as a 
separate farm and the allotments or quotas, shall be assigned to that 
part in accordance with paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section. Such 
apportionment shall be made prior to any designation of allotments and 
quotas, with respect to the part which has been owned for 3 years or 
more.
    (5) The designation by landowner method is not applicable to crop 
allotments or quotas which are restricted to transfer within the county 
by lease, sale, or by owner, when the land on which the farm is located 
is in two or more counties.
    (6) The designation by landowner method may be applied at the 
owner's request to land owned by any Indian Tribal Council which is 
leased to two or more producers for the production of any crop of a 
commodity for which an allotment, quota, or acreage has been 
established. If the land is leased to two or more producers, an Indian 
Tribal Council may request that the county committee divide the 
allotments, quotas, and acreages between the applicable tracts in the 
manner designated by the Council. The use of this method shall not be 
subject to the conditions of paragraph (c)(4).
    (d)(1) The contribution method is the proration of a parent farm's 
allotments, quotas, and acreages to each tract as the tract contributed 
to the allotments, quotas, or acreages at the time of combination and 
may be used when the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section do not apply. The contribution method shall be used to divide 
allotments and quotas for a farm that resulted from a combination which 
became effective during the 6-year period before the crop year for

[[Page 94]]

which the reconstitution is effective. This method for dividing 
allotments and quotas shall be used beyond the 6-year period if FSA 
records are available to show the amount of contribution.
    (2) The county committee determines with the concurrence of the 
State committee or representative thereof, that the use of the 
contribution method would not result in an equitable distribution of 
allotments and quotas, considering available land, cultural operations, 
and changes in type of farming. The contribution method shall not be 
used in cases involving the division of allotment or quota for any 
commodity for which there was no allotment or quota established at the 
time of the combination.
    (e) The agricultural use method is the proration of contract acreage 
to the tracts being separated from the parent farm in the same 
proportion that the agricultural and related activity land for each 
tract bears to the agricultural and related activity land for the parent 
farm. This method of division shall be used if the provisions of 
paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section do not apply.
    (f)(1) The cropland method is the proration of allotments and quotas 
to the tracts being separated from the parent farm in the same 
proportion that the cropland for each tract bears to the cropland for 
the parent farm. This method shall be used if the provisions of 
paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section do not apply unless the 
county committee determines that a division by the history method would 
result in allotments and quotas which are more representative than if 
the cropland method is used after taking into consideration the 
operation normally carried out on each tract for the commodities 
produced on the farm.
    (2) The cropland method shall not be used to divide contract 
acreage.
    (g)(1) The history method is the proration of allotments and quotas 
to the tracts being separated from the farm on the basis of the 
allotments and quotas determined to be representative of the operations 
normally carried out on each tract. The county committee may use the 
history method of dividing allotments and quotas when it:
    (i) Determines that this method would result in the proration of 
allotments and quotas, more representative than the cropland method of 
division of the operation normally carried out on each tract; and
    (ii) Obtains written consent of all owners to use the history 
method.
    (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the county 
committee may waive the requirement for written consent of the owners 
for dividing allotments and quotas if the county committee determines 
that the use of the cropland method would result in an inequitable 
division of the parent farm's allotments and quotas and the use of the 
history method would provide more favorable results for all owners.
    (3) The history method shall not be used to divide contract acreage.
    (h)(1) Allotments, quotas, and acreages apportioned among the 
divided tracts pursuant to paragraphs (d), (e), (f) and (g) of this 
section may be increased or decreased with respect to a tract by as much 
as 10 percent of the allotment, quota, or acreage determined under such 
subsections for the parent farm if:
    (i) The owners agree in writing; and
    (ii) The county committee determines the method used did not provide 
an equitable distribution considering available land, cultural 
operations, and changes in the type of farming conducted on the farm. 
Any increase in an allotment, quota, or acreage with respect to a tract 
pursuant to this paragraph shall be offset by a corresponding decrease 
for such allotments, quotas or acreages established with respect to the 
other tracts which constitute the farm.
    (2) Farm program payment yields calculated for the resulting farms 
of a division performed according to paragraphs (d) through (g) may be 
increased or decreased if the county committee determines the method 
used did not provide an equitable distribution considering available 
land, cultural operations, and changes in the type of farming conducted 
on the farm. Any increase in a farm program payment yield on a resulting 
farm shall be offset by a corresponding decrease on another resulting 
farm of the division.

[[Page 95]]

    (i) If a farm with burley tobacco quota is divided through 
reconstitution and one or more of the farms resulting from the division 
are apportioned less than 1,000 pounds of burley tobacco quota, the 
owners of such farms shall take action as provided in part 723 of this 
chapter to comply with the 1,000 pound minimum by July 1 of the current 
year or the quota shall be dropped. Exceptions to this are farms 
divided:
    (1) Among family members;
    (2) By the estate method; and
    (3) When no sale or change in ownership of land occurs.

Sec. 718.206  Rules for determining allotments, quotas, and acreages when reconstitution is made by combination.

    When two or more farms or tracts are combined for a year, that 
year's allotments, quotas, and acreages, with respect to the combined 
farm or tract, as required by applicable commodity regulations, shall 
not be greater than the sum of the allotments, quotas, and acreages for 
each of the farms or tracts comprising the combination, subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 718.204.

[61 FR 37552, July 18, 1996; 61 FR 49049, Sept. 18, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 718.207  Eminent domain acquisitions.

    (a) This section provides a uniform method for reallocating 
allotments and quotas, with respect to land involved in eminent domain 
acquisitions. Such allotments and quotas, in accordance with this 
section, may be pooled for the benefit of the owner who is displaced 
from the acquired farm by eminent domain acquisition. Such pooling shall 
be for a 3-year period from the date of displacement or during such 
other period as the displaced owner may request for the transfer of 
allotments and quotas, from the pool to other farms owned by such 
person.
    (b) An eminent domain acquisition is a taking of title to land, or 
the taking of an impoundment easement to impound water on the land, or 
the taking of a flowage easement to intermittently flood the land, 
consummated with respect to land which is, or could be, so taken under 
the power of eminent domain by a Federal, State, or other agency. Such 
acquisition may be by court proceedings to condemn the land or by 
negotiation between the agency and the owner. An acquisition by an 
agency with respect to land not subject to the agency's power of eminent 
domain shall not be an eminent domain acquisition for purposes of this 
section. All land acquired by an agency for the intended project, 
including surrounding land not needed for the project but acquired as a 
package acquisition, shall be considered to be in the eminent domain 
acquisition if the agency expended funds for the package acquisition on 
the basis of its power of eminent domain.
    (c) For purposes of this section, owner means the person, or persons 
in a joint ownership, having title to the land for a period of at least 
12 months immediately prior to the date of transfer of title or grant of 
the impoundment or flowage easement under the eminent domain 
acquisition. If such person or persons have owned the land for less than 
such 12-month period, they may, nevertheless, be considered the owner if 
the State committee determines that such person or persons acquired the 
land for the purpose of carrying out farming operations and not for the 
purpose of obtaining status as an owner under this section. However, no 
person shall be considered the owner if he acquired the land subject to 
an eminent domain acquisition under an outstanding contract to an agency 
or an option by an agency or subject to pending condemnation 
proceedings. In any case where the current titleholders cannot be 
considered the owner for the purpose of this section, the State 
committee shall determine the person or persons who previously had title 
to the land and who qualify for status as the owner under the criteria 
in this paragraph.
    (d) The owner shall be considered displaced from a farm which is 
subject to an eminent domain acquisition on the date:
    (1) The owner loses possession of the land;
    (2) The owner is voluntarily displaced if a binding contract for 
acquisition has been executed;

[[Page 96]]

    (3) The owner, in the case of a flowage easement, determines it is 
no longer practical to conduct farming operations on the land; or
    (4) The owner loses possession of the land as lessee under a lease 
from the agency or its designee if the lease provided uninterrupted 
possession to the owner from the date of acquisition to the end of the 
lease or extensions of the lease.
    (e) The owner shall notify the county committee in writing of the 
eminent domain acquisition and furnish the date of displacement within 
30 days so that allotments and quotas may be pooled in accordance with 
this section. Failure to so notify the county committee shall result in 
the loss of the ability of the owner to extend the 3-year period of the 
pool.
    (f) Whenever the county committee determines, by notice from the 
owner or otherwise, that an owner has been displaced from the farm, the 
county committee shall establish a pool for the allotments and quotas 
eligible for pooling under this section for a 3-year period beginning on 
the date of displacement. Pooled allotments and quotas shall be 
considered fully planted and, for each year in the pool, shall be 
established in accordance with applicable commodity regulations.
    (g) Pooling is not permitted or required:
    (1) If the county committee determines that an agency has authority 
under its eminent domain powers to acquire a farm for the continued 
production of an allotment or quota and does so acquire a farm only for 
such purpose and files a written notice with the county committee of the 
county in which the farm is located at the time of acquisition 
designating the allotment and quota to be produced on the farm, there 
shall be no pooling of such allotment and quota. Such farm allotments 
and quotas shall be established for the farm in accordance with 
applicable commodity regulations. For acreages, there shall be no 
pooling of the acreage under any circumstances if an agency acquires 
land and retains the land in an agricultural or related activity;
    (2) If the displaced owner files written notice with the county 
committee of an intention to waive the right to have all the allotments 
and quotas or any part thereof pooled and the county committee 
determines that the displaced owner has not been coerced to waive such 
right, the allotments and quotas shall be retained on the agency 
acquired land;
    (3) If an agency acquires part of a farm for non-farming purposes 
and the cropland on the land so acquired represents less than 15 percent 
of the total cropland on the farm, the allotments and quotas shall be 
retained on the portion of the farm not acquired by the agency and shall 
not be pooled;
    (4) If an agency acquires part of a farm for non-farming purposes 
and the cropland on the land so acquired represents 15 percent or more 
of the total cropland on a farm, the allotments and quotas attributable 
to the acquired land shall be retained on the portion of the farm not 
acquired by the agency if the owner files a written request with the 
county committee for such retention. The amount of an allotment and 
quota which may be retained on the farm cannot exceed the land devoted 
to an agricultural or related activity. Allotments and quotas which are 
not retained shall be pooled; or
    (5) If, prior to pooling, an owner files a request to transfer the 
allotments and quotas to other farms in the same county which are owned 
by such owner, the county committee may approve a direct transfer 
without the formal establishment of a pool. Such transfer shall be 
subject to the requirements of paragraph (j) of this section. This 
paragraph shall govern the release and reapportionment of pooled 
allotments and quotas notwithstanding other provisions of applicable 
commodity regulations.
    (h) Pooled allotments and quotas may be released on an annual basis 
by the owner to a county committee during any year for which allotments 
and quotas are pooled and not otherwise transferred from the pool. The 
county committee may reapportion the released allotments and quotas to 
other farms in the same county that have allotments or quotas for the 
same commodity. Pooled allotments and quotas shall not be released on a 
permanent basis or surrendered after release to

[[Page 97]]

the State committee for reapportionment in other counties. 
Reapportionment shall be on the basis of past acreage of the commodity, 
land, labor, and equipment available for the production of the 
commodity, crop rotation practices, and other physical factors affecting 
the production of the commodity. Pooled allotments and quotas which are 
released shall be considered to have been fully planted in the pool and 
not on the farm to which such allotments and quotas are reapportioned.
    (i) Pooled allotments and quotas that may be transferred on a 
permanent or temporary basis by sale, lease, or by owner designation may 
be transferred permanently from the pool by the owner or temporarily for 
the duration of the pooled allotment or quota, subject to the terms and 
conditions for such transfers in the applicable commodity regulations. 
The transfer of tobacco acreage allotment or marketing quota shall be 
approved acre for acre.
    (j) (1) The displaced owners may request a transfer of all or part 
of the pooled allotments and quotas to any other farm in the United 
States which is owned by the displaced owner, but only if there are 
farms in the receiving county with allotments and quotas, for the 
particular commodity or, if there are no such farms, the county 
committee determines that farms in the receiving county are suited for 
the production of the commodity. For purposes of this paragraph:
    (i) Receiving farm means the farm to which transfer from the pool is 
to be made;
    (ii) Receiving State and county committee mean those committees for 
the State and county in which the receiving farm is located; and
    (iii) Transferring State and county committees mean those committees 
for the State and county in which the agency acquired farm is located.
    (2) The displaced owner shall file with the receiving county 
committee written application for transfer of an allotment and quota 
from the pool within 3 years after the date of displacement. The 
application shall contain a certification from the owner that no 
agreement has been made with any person for the purpose of obtaining an 
allotment or quota from the pool for a person other than for the 
displaced owner. The owner shall attach to the application all pertinent 
documents pertaining to the current ownership or purchase of land and 
any leasing arrangements, such as the deed of trust or mortgage, a 
warranty deed, a note, sales agreement, and lease.
    (3) The receiving county committee shall consider each application 
and determine whether the transfer from the pool shall be approved. 
Before an application is acted upon by the receiving county committee, 
the owner shall personally appear before the receiving county committee 
after reasonable notice, bring any additional pertinent documents as may 
be requested for examination by the receiving county committee, and 
answer all pertinent questions bearing on the proposed transfer. Such 
personal appearance requirement may be waived if the receiving county 
committee determines from facts presented to it on behalf of the owner 
that such personal appearance would unduly inconvenience the owner on 
account of illness or other good cause and such personal appearance 
would serve no useful purpose. Any action by the receiving county 
committee shall be subject to the approval required under paragraph 
(j)(5) of this section.
    (4) The transfer from the pool will be approved by the receiving 
county committee only if the county committee determines that the owner 
has made a normal acquisition of the receiving farm for the purpose of 
bona fide ownership to reestablish farming operations. The elements of 
such an acquisition shall include, but are not limited to, the 
following:
    (i) Appropriate legal documents must establish title to the 
receiving farm;
    (ii) If the displaced owner was the operator of the acquired farm at 
the date of displacement, such owner must personally operate and be the 
operator of the receiving farm for the first year that the allotment and 
quota is transferred;
    (iii) If the displaced owner was not the operator of the acquired 
farm at the date of displacement and was not a producer on that farm 
because the leasing or rental agreement provided for

[[Page 98]]

cash, fixed rent, or standing rent payment, such owner shall not be 
required to operate personally and be the operator of the receiving 
farm, but at least 75 percent of the allotments for the receiving farm 
must be planted on the receiving farm during the first year of the 
transfer. With respect to a commodity for which a quota is applicable 
but for which there is no acreage allotment, an acreage which is equal 
to the result of dividing the quota transferred to the receiving farms 
by the receiving farm's yield, multiplied by 75 percent must be planted 
during the first year of the transfer;
    (iv) If the displaced owner was not the operator of the acquired 
farm at the date of displacement but was a producer on that farm at the 
date of displacement as the result of having received a share of the 
crops produced on the acquired farm, such displaced owner shall not be 
required to be the operator of the receiving farm but must be a producer 
on the receiving farm during the first year that an allotment or quota 
is transferred;
    (v) The contractual arrangements between the displaced owner and the 
seller of the receiving farm must not contain a requirement that the 
receiving farm be leased to the seller or a person designated by or 
subject to the control of the seller. The seller or a person designated 
by or subject to the control of the seller may not lease the receiving 
farm for the first year the allotment or quota is transferred; and
    (vi) The contractual arrangements under which the receiving farm was 
purchased or leased must be customary in the community where the 
receiving farm is located with respect to purchase price and timing and 
amount of purchase or rental payments.
    (5) The approval by the receiving county committee of a transfer 
from the pool under this paragraph shall be effective upon concurrence 
by the State committee of the State where the receiving farm is located 
(the receiving State committee). Notwithstanding any other provision of 
this section, the receiving State committee may authorize a transfer 
from the pool in any case where the owner presents evidence satisfactory 
to the receiving State committee that:
    (i) The eligibility requirements of paragraph (j)(4) (ii), (iii) and 
(iv) of this section cannot be met without substantial hardship because 
of illness, old age, multiple farm ownership, or lack of a dwelling on 
the farm to which an allotment or quota is to be transferred; or
    (ii) The owner has made a normal acquisition of the receiving farm 
for the purpose of bona fide ownership to reestablish farming operations 
for the displaced owner, even if the farm is leased to the seller of the 
farm for the first year for which the allotment or quota is transferred.
    (6) Upon completion of all necessary approvals under this paragraph, 
the receiving county committee shall issue an appropriate notice of 
allotment and quota under the applicable commodity regulations, taking 
into consideration the land, labor, and equipment available for the 
production of the commodity, crop rotation practices, and the soil and 
other physical factors affecting the production of the commodity. For 
purposes of determining the amount of the allotment and quota available 
for transfer, the receiving county committee shall consider the 
receiving tract as a separate ownership. The acreage transferred from 
the pool shall not exceed the allotments and quotas, most recently 
established for the acquired farm placed in the pool. When all or a part 
of the allotment and quota placed in the pool is transferred and used to 
establish or increase the allotment and quota for other farms owned or 
purchased by the owner, all of the proportionate part of the past 
acreage history for the acquired farm shall be transferred to and 
considered for purposes of future allotments and quotas to have been 
planted on the receiving farm for which an allotment and quota, are 
established or increased under this section. If only a part of the 
available allotment and quota is transferred from the pool, the 
remaining part of the allotment and quota, shall remain in the pool for 
transfer to other farms of the owner until all such allotments and 
quotas have been transferred or until the period of eligibility for 
establishing or increasing allotments and quotas under this section has 
expired.

[[Page 99]]

    (7) If any allotment or quota is transferred under this section and 
it is later determined by the receiving county or State committee, or by 
the Deputy Administrator, that the transfer was obtained by 
misrepresentation by or on behalf of the owner, or that the conditions 
of paragraph (j)(4) of this section are not met, the allotment and quota 
for the receiving farm shall be reduced for each year the transfer 
purportedly was in effect by the amount attributable to the allotment or 
quota transferred from the pool. If the time period for the transfer of 
the allotment or quota from the pool has not expired, the amount of 
allotment or quota initially transferred from the pool shall be returned 
to the pool after the period of time has expired in which the displaced 
owner could exercise the right of administrative review. Any 
cancellation of the transfer of an allotment or quota by the receiving 
county committee shall be subject to approval by the receiving State 
committee. The receiving county committee shall issue a notice of any 
marketing quota and penalty as may be required in accordance with 
applicable commodity regulations.
    (8) If the displaced owner files a request for transfer of pooled 
allotments or quotas, within the prescribed period for filing such 
request, but the request for transfer is filed during a year in which 
all or a part of the pooled allotments or quotas were released to the 
transferring county committee pursuant to paragraph (h), the application 
for transfer will be processed in the usual manner but the amount of the 
commodity released shall not be effective on the receiving farm until 
the succeeding year. When a request for transfer of pooled allotment or 
quota involves a transfer from one State to another, the receiving State 
committee shall obtain information from the transferring State committee 
as to whether any part of the allotment or quota for which the transfer 
is requested has been released to the transferring county committee for 
the current year.
    (k)(1) When the displaced owner leases part but not all of the 
agency acquired land, such part shall be constituted as a separate farm 
on the date of the displacement of the owner from the land not so 
leased.
    (2) If a parent farm consists of separate ownership tracts, each 
such tract being acquired in whole or in part shall be considered as a 
separate farm for purposes of paragraphs (g) (3) and (4) of this 
section.
    (3) If a portion of a farm is acquired by an agency and the owner is 
displaced therefrom, the acquired portion shall be constituted as a 
separate farm on the date of displacement unless the allotments and 
quotas are retained on the portion not acquired as provided in 
paragraphs (g) (3) and (4) of this section, in which case the farm shall 
not be reconstituted but the farmland and cropland data shall be 
corrected on all appropriate records for the parent farm.
    (l)(1) The displaced owner may file with the county committee a 
written designation of beneficiary of the rights in the allotments and 
quotas attributable to the acquired land in the event of the death of 
the displaced owner, and may revise such designation from time to time. 
The beneficiary of a deceased owner may exercise the right to continue a 
lease or negotiate a lease with the agency or its designee, the regular 
transfer rights with respect to farms owned by such beneficiary, and the 
release, sale, lease, and owner transfer rights under this section.
    (2) If the displaced owner does not file a designation of 
beneficiary under paragraph (l)(1) and the displaced owner dies before 
displacement or after pooling occurs, the following persons shall be 
considered the beneficiary with the rights provided under paragraph 
(l)(1) of this section:
    (i) The surviving joint owner of the farm where two persons own the 
farm as joint tenants with right of survivorship; and
    (ii) The persons who succeed to the deceased displaced owner's 
interest under a will or by intestate succession. However, in the case 
of intestate succession, the person shall be limited to the surviving 
spouse, parent, sibling or child of the deceased displaced owner. In the 
settlement of the estate of the deceased displaced owner, the heirs may 
file a written agreement with the

[[Page 100]]

county committee for the division of the deceased displaced owner's 
rights under this section.
    (m)(1) No transfer from the pool under paragraph (h), (i), or (j) of 
this section shall be approved if there remains any unpaid marketing 
quota penalty due with respect to the marketing of the commodity from 
the acquired farm by the displaced owner, or if any of the commodity 
produced on the agency acquired farm has not been accounted for as 
required under applicable commodity regulations.
    (2) If an allotment or quota for an acquired farm next established 
after the data of displacement would have been reduced because of false 
or improper identification of the commodity produced on or marketed from 
the farm, or as the result of a false acreage report, the allotment or 
quota shall be reduced in the pool in accordance with the applicable 
commodity regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 718.208  Exempting Federal prison farms and Federal wildlife refuges.

    A marketing penalty shall not be assessed with respect to any 
commodity which is produced on a Federal prison farm or Federal wildlife 
refuge. This exception does not apply to penalties incurred by an 
individual who has a separate interest in a crop which is subject to 
marketing quotas and was produced on a Federal prison farm or Federal 
wildlife refuge.


<R05>
Sec. 718.209  Transfer of allotments and quotas--State public lands.

    (a) Transfers of allotments and quotas between farms in the same 
county may be permitted where both farms are lands owned by the State.
    (b) An application requesting the transfer of one or more of the 
allotments and quotas on a farm entirely comprised of lands owned by a 
State shall be filed with the county committee by the State. The 
application shall identify the farms as being within the same county, 
show that each farm is entirely comprised of lands owned by the State, 
and list the allotments and quotas requested to be transferred. 
Additional information with respect to the present operations on the 
farms, including all leasing arrangements, shall also be set forth in 
the application.
    (c) The State committee shall establish the closing date for filing 
applications under paragraph (b) of this section for each year which 
shall be no later than the general planting date in the county for the 
commodity involved in the transfer.
    (d)(1) Each transfer of an allotment and quota under this section 
shall be adjusted for differences in farm productivity if the yield 
projected for the year the transfer is to take effect for the farm to 
which transfer is made exceeds by more than ten percent the yield 
projected for the year the transfer is to take effect for the farm from 
which transfer is made. The county committee shall determine the amount 
of the allotment and quota to be transferred where a productivity 
adjustment is required to be made by dividing:
    (i) The product of the yield for the farm from which the transfer is 
made and the acreage to be transferred from such farm, by
    (ii) The yield for the farm to which the transfer is made.
    (2) Acreage for the farm receiving the allotment or quota shall be 
adjusted by the same percentage as the allotment or quota being 
transferred is adjusted. The amount of the allotment and quota and 
related acreage transferred from the farm from which the transfer is 
made shall be the full amount, but the amount of all allotment or quota 
and related acreage for the farm to which the transfer is made shall be 
the adjusted amount.
    (e) The amount of allotment and quota on a farm after a transfer 
under this section is made shall not exceed the average amount of 
allotment or quota of at least three farms with acreage of cropland 
similar to the farm receiving the transfer in the community having the 
applicable allotment acreage and quota on these farms.
    (f) Each transfer of any allotment and quota shall be subject to the 
condition that an acreage equal to the allotment and quota transferred, 
before any productivity adjustment, shall be devoted to and maintained 
in permanent vegetative cover on the farm from which the transfer is 
made. The acreage to be devoted to and maintained in

[[Page 101]]

permanent vegetative cover with respect to quota crops shall be 
determined by dividing the quota transferred by the yield of the farm 
from which the quota is transferred.
    (g) Transfer of an allotment and quota under this section shall only 
be approved if:
    (1) The county committee determines that a timely filed application 
has been received and that the provisions of this section have been met; 
and
    (2) A representative of the State committee also determines that the 
provisions of this section have been met. If such a transfer is 
approved, the county committee shall issue revised notices of the 
allotment or quota for each farm affected by the transfer. If a county 
committee obtains evidence that the conditions applicable to any 
transfer under this section have not been met, a report of the facts 
shall be made to the State committee. If the State committee determines 
that such conditions have not been met, the transfer will be canceled, 
and the allotment and quota shall be retransferred to the original farm. 
Where cancellation and retransfer is required, the county committee 
shall issue revised notices of the allotment or quota showing the 
reasons for the cancellation of the transfer.

<R05>
Sec. 718.307  Special relief approval authority for State Executive Directors.

    (a) General nature of the special authority. Notwithstanding 
provisions in this subpart providing supervision and relief authority to 
other officials, an SED without further review by other officials (other 
than the Secretary) may grant relief to a participant under the 
provisions of Secs. 718.303 and 718.304 as if the SED were the final 
arbiter within the agency of such matters so long as:
    (1) The program matter with respect to which the relief is sought is 
a program matter in a covered program which is operated within the State 
under the control of the SED;
    (2) The total amount of relief which will be provided to the 
person(that is, to the individual or entity that applies for the relief) 
by thatSED under this special authority for errors during that year is 
less than$20,000 (including in that calculation, any loan amount or 
other benefit of any kind payable for that year and any other year);
    (3) The total amount of such relief which has been previously 
provided to

[[Page 103]]

the participant using this special authority for errors in that year, as 
calculated above, is not more than $5,000;
    (4) The total amount of loans, payments, and benefits of any kind 
for which relief is provided to similarly situated participants by the 
SED (or the SED's predecessor) for errors for any year under the 
authority provided in this section, as calculated above, is not more 
than $1,000,000.
    (b) Report of the exercise of the power. A grant of relief shall be 
considered to be under this section and subject to the special finality 
provided in this section only if the SED grants the relief in writing 
when granting the relief to the party who will receive the benefit of 
such relief and only if, in that document, the SED declares that they 
are exercising that power. The SED must report the exercise of that 
power to the Deputy Administrator so that a full accounting may be made 
in keeping with the limitations of this section. Absent such a report, 
relief will not be considered to have been made under this section.
    (c) Additional limits on the authority. The authority provided under 
this section does not extend to:
    (1) The administration of payment limitations under part 1400 of 
this chapter (Secs. 1001 to 1001F of 7 U.S.C. 1308 et seq.);
    (2) The administration of payment limitations under a conservation 
program administered by the Secretary; or
    (3) Highly erodible land and wetland conservation requirements under 
subtitles B or C of Title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 
U.S.C.3811 et seq.) as administered under 7 CFR part 12.
    (d) Relief may not be provided by the SED under this section until a 
written opinion or written acknowledgment is obtained from OGC that 
grounds exist for determination that the program participant has, in 
good faith, detrimentally relied on the guidance or actions of an 
authorized FSA representative in accordance with the provisions of this 
subpart, or that the producer otherwise failed, in good faith, to fully 
comply with the requirements of the program and that the granting of the 
relief is within the lawful authority of the SED.
    (e) Relation to other authorities. The authority provided under this 
section is in addition to any other applicable authority that may allow 
relief. Generally, the SED may, without consultation other than with 
OGC, decide all matters under $20,000 but those decisions shall not be 
subject to modification within the Farm Service Agency to the extent 
provided for under the rules of this section.

Sec. 723.201  Determination of preliminary farm acreage allotments and preliminary farm marketing quotas.

    (a) Flue-cured tobacco. A preliminary farm acreage allotment shall 
be determined for the current year for each farm which has flue-cured 
tobacco history acreage for the base period. The preliminary farm 
acreage allotment shall be the same as the farm acreage allotment 
established for the preceding year.
    (b) Burley tobacco. The preceding year's farm marketing quota shall 
be the current year's preliminary farm marketing quota for each old farm 
except that the preliminary farm marketing quota shall be zero if:
    (1) The farm or all of cropland has gone out of agricultural 
production and eminent domain procedure of part 718 of this chapter does 
not apply.
    (2) Quota that was pooled under the provisions of part 718 of this 
chapter has been canceled.
    (3) A new farm quota that was established in a prior year is 
canceled.
    (4) There was no acreage of burley tobacco planted or considered 
planted for any year of the base period.
    (5) All the cropland on the farm has been determined by the county 
FSA committee to be no longer suitable for the production of a crop and 
provisions of part 704 of this chapter do not apply.
    (6) Beginning with the 1994 crop year there was no acreage of burley 
tobacco planted or considered planted in 2 out of the 3 immediate 
preceding years.
    (c) Kinds of tobacco other than flue-cured and burley. A preliminary 
farm acreage allotment shall be determined for each farm which has 
tobacco history acreage, as established under paragraph Sec. 723.218 of 
this part in the base period. If the history acreage for the previous 
year is the same as the basic allotment, the preliminary allotment shall 
be the same as the previous year's basic allotment. Otherwise, the 
preliminary allotment shall be the simple average of the sum of the 
basic allotment and history acreage for the preceding year.

Sec. 723.202  Determining farm acreage allotment, except for flue-cured tobacco.

    With respect to each kind of tobacco, the preliminary allotments 
determined for all old farms shall be adjusted uniformly so that the 
total of such allotments for old farms plus the reserve acreage 
available for establishing new farm allotments, adjusting inequities in 
acreage allotments for old farms, and for correcting errors in old farm 
allotments shall not exceed the national acreage allotment established 
for such kind of tobacco.


<R05>
Sec. 723.203  Determination of flue-cured tobacco preliminary farm yields.

    (a) Old farms. The preliminary farm yield for a flue-cured tobacco 
old farm for the current year shall be determined as follows:
    (1) Farm having preliminary farm acreage allotment. The preliminary 
farm yield established for the farm shall be the same preliminary farm 
yield as was in effect for the preceding year.
    (2) Farm not having preliminary farm acreage allotment. The 
preliminary farm yield shall be determined by dividing the farm yield by 
the national yield factor.
    (b) New Farms. The preliminary farm yield for a new farm shall be 
determined by dividing the farm yield determined in accordance with 
Sec. 723.204 of this part for such farm by the national yield factor 
applicable for the year in which the new farm allotment was established.


<R05>
Sec. 723.204  Determination of farm yields and normal yields.

    (a) Flue-cured tobacco. The farm yield for an old farm shall be 
determined by multiplying the preliminary farm yield, if the farm has 
such a yield, by the national yield factor for the current year. The 
farm yield for new farms and old farms that do not have a preliminary 
yield shall be that yield, which the county FSA committee determines for 
the farm taking into consideration:

[[Page 113]]

    (1) The soil and other physical factors affecting the production of 
tobacco on the farm, and
    (2) The farm yields determined for other farms on which the soil and 
other physical factors affecting the production of tobacco are similar.
    (b) Burley tobacco. The farm yield for a farm on which a farm yield 
has been established shall be the same in the current year as the farm 
yield previously established for the farm. For any farm not having a 
previously established yield, the county FSA committee shall establish a 
yield based on similar farms having a farm yield; however, such yield 
shall not exceed 3500 pounds.
    (c) All kinds of tobacco except burley and flue-cured. The normal 
yield for a farm shall be that yield which the county FSA committee 
determines is normal for the farm taking into consideration the yields 
obtained on the farm during any of the years of the base period for 
which data are available, the soil and other physical factors affecting 
the production of tobacco on the farm, and the yields obtained on other 
farms in the locality which are similar with respect to such factors. 
The normal yield first determined for a farm for any year in accordance 
with the foregoing provision shall serve as the normal yield for the 
farm for all purposes in connection with the tobacco marketing program 
for the year for which such normal yield is determined.


<R05>
Sec. 723.205  Determination of farm acreage allotments and effective farm acreage allotments for flue-cured tobacco.

    (a) Farm acreage allotments. The farm acreage allotment shall be 
determined by multiplying the national acreage factor as determined by 
the Secretary for the current year by the preliminary farm acreage 
allotment for the current year and adjusting the result by:
    (1) Upward adjustment. Adding the:
    (i) Acreage approved in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 723.210 of this part in order to adjust for an inequity or to 
correct an error;
    (ii) Acreage determined by dividing the pounds of quota which are 
purchased in the current year by the farm yield; and
    (iii) Acreage determined by dividing the pounds of forfeited quota 
which are approved for adjustment from the forfeiture pool by the farm 
yield.
    (2) Downward Adjustment. Subtracting the:
    (i) Acreage determined by dividing the pounds of quota sold in the 
current year by the farm yield; and
    (ii) Acreage of forfeited allotment.
    (b) Effective farm acreage allotment. The effective farm acreage 
allotment for the current year shall be determined by dividing by the 
effective farm marketing quota by the farm yield.


<R05>
Sec. 723.206  Determining farm marketing quotas and effective farm marketing quotas.

    (a) Burley tobacco. The burley farm marketing quota shall be 
determined by multiplying the national factor as determined by the 
Secretary for the current year by the preliminary farm marketing quota 
for the current year and adjusting the result for permanent quota 
adjustments.
    (b) Flue-cured tobacco. The flue-cured farm marketing quota shall be 
determined by multiplying the farm acreage allotment by the farm yield.
    (c) Burley or flue-cured tobacco. The effective farm marketing quota 
shall be the farm marketing quota adjusted by:
    (1) Upward adjustments. Adding the:
    (i) Effective under marketings from the preceding marketing year, 
but effective for the 2002 and subsequent marketing years, the aggregate 
amount for all farms of under marketings of burley tobacco for all farms 
that can be carried over shall be limited to 10 percent of the national 
basic quota of the preceding year. If needed, factoring will be 
undertaken to insure that the limit of the preceding sentence is not 
exceeded.
    (ii) The pounds of quota which are temporarily transferred to the 
farm in the current year.
    (2) Downward adjustments. Subtracting the pounds of quota that are:
    (i) Overmarketed from the preceding marketing year,
    (ii) Overmarketed from any year before the preceding year but have 
not been subtracted when determining the

[[Page 114]]

effective farm marketing quota in a prior year.
    (iii) Temporarily transferred from the farm in the current year.
    (iv) Reduced in the current year as a result of a violation in a 
prior year as provided for in Sec. 723.408 of this part.
    (v) [Reserved]
    (vi) Determined, for flue-cured tobacco only, by multiplying the 
farm yield by the acres reduced from the flue-cured tobacco acreage

<R05>
Sec. 723.207  Determination of acreage allotments or burley marketing quotas for new farms.

    (a)(1) All kinds of tobacco. The acreage allotment or burley 
marketing quota established in any crop year for all new farms shall not 
exceed the national acreage or poundage, as applicable, reserved for new 
farms for the respective kind of tobacco. The acreage allotment or 
burley marketing quota for a new farm shall be that acreage or burley 
marketing quota which the county FSA committee, with the approval of the 
State FSA committee, determines is fair and reasonable for the farm, 
taking into consideration the past tobacco experience of the farm 
operator; the land, labor, and equipment available for the production of 
tobacco; crop rotation practices; and the soil and other physical 
factors affecting the production of tobacco. Such acreage allotments or 
burley marketing quota shall not exceed 50 percent (75 percent for 
Cigar-filler and Binder tobacco) of the average of the applicable 
acreage allotments or burley marketing quotas established for at least 
two but not more than five old farms which are similar with respect to 
land, labor; and equipment available for the production of tobacco; crop 
rotation practices; and the soil and other physical factors affecting 
the production of tobacco; and with respect to flue-cured tobacco 
acreage allotments, shall not exceed one acre.
    (2) Kinds of tobacco, except burley and flue-cured. If the acreage 
planted to tobacco on a new tobacco farm is less than 75 percent of the 
tobacco acreage allotment otherwise established for the farm pursuant to 
this section, such allotment shall be automatically reduced to the sum 
of the tobacco planted acreage and the prevented planted tobacco acreage 
as determined under part 718 of this chapter for the farm.
    (b)(1) Written application. The farm operator must file an 
application for a new farm acreage allotment or marketing quota at the 
office of the county FSA committee where the farm is administratively 
located on or before February 15 of the year for which the new farm 
acreage allotment or marketing quota is requested.
    (2) Operator requirements. The operator requesting a new farm 
acreage allotment or marketing quota must be the sole owner of the farm, 
except for Cigar-filler and Binder tobacco, the operator need not own 
the farm. The farm operator shall not own or have an ownership interest 
in or operate any other farm in the United States for which a tobacco 
allotment or quota for any kind of tobacco is established for the 
current year.
    (3) Availability of equipment and facilities. The operator must own, 
or have readily available, adequate equipment and any other facilities 
of production necessary to the production of tobacco on the farm.
    (4)(i) Income from farming. The operator must expect to obtain 
during the current year more than 50 percent of the producer's income 
from the production of agricultural commodities or products. The 
following shall be considered in computing the operator's income:
    (A) Farm income. Income from farming shall include the estimated 
return from home gardens, livestock and livestock products, poultry, or 
other agricultural products produced for home consumption or other use 
on the farm(s). The estimated return from the production of the 
requested new farm allotment or quota shall not be included.

[[Page 115]]

    (B) Non-farm income. Non-farming income shall include but not 
limited to salaries, commissions, pensions, social security payments, 
and unemployment compensation.
    (C) Spousal income. The spouse's farm and non-farm income shall be 
included in the computation.
    (ii) Operator a partnership. If the operator is a partnership, each 
partner must expect to obtain more than 50 percent of their current year 
income from farming.
    (iii) Operator a corporation. If the operator is a corporation, it 
must have no other major corporate purpose other than ownership or 
operation of the farm(s). Farming must provide its officers and general 
manager with more than 50 percent of their expected income. Salaries and 
dividends from the corporation shall be considered as income from 
farming.
    (iv) Special provisions for low-income farmers. The county FSA 
committee may waive the income provisions in this section provided they 
determine that the farm operator's income, from both farm and non-farm 
sources is so low that it will not provide a reasonable standard of 
living for the operator and the operator's family, and a State FSA 
committee representative approves such action. In making their 
determination, the county FSA committee shall consider such factors as 
size and type of farming operations, estimated net worth, estimated 
gross family income, estimated family off-farm income, number of 
dependents, and other factors affecting the individual's ability to 
provide a reasonable standard of living.
    (5) Experience. The operator must have had experience in producing, 
harvesting, and marketing the kind of tobacco requested. Such experience 
must have been gained by being a sharecropper, tenant, or farm operator 
(bona fide tobacco production experience gained by a person as a member 
of a partnership shall be accepted as experience gained in meeting this 
requirement) during at least 2 of the 5 years immediately preceding the 
year for which the new farm allotment is requested. The experience must 
have been gained on a farm having a tobacco allotment for such years for 
the kind of tobacco requested in the application. However, for Cigar-
filler and binder tobacco only, the operator must have experience in any 
prior year in the production of tobacco as a farm owner, farm operator, 
sharecropper, tenant, warehouse operator, or laborer on a farm which 
produced Cigar-filler and binder tobacco.
    (6) Operator has not sold or forfeited allotment. For flue-cured 
tobacco only, during the current or the 4 preceding years, the operator 
must not have sold or forfeited any flue-cured tobacco allotment from 
any farm.
    (c) Eligibility requirements for the farm. A new farm acreage 
allotment or marketing quota may be established if each of the following 
conditions is met:
    (1) Current allotment or quota. The farm must not have on the date 
of approval of a new farm acreage allotment, an allotment or quota for 
any kind of tobacco.
    (2) Availability of land, type of soil, and topography. The 
available land, type of soil, and topography of the land on the farm 
must be suitable for tobacco production. Also, continuous production of 
tobacco must not result in an undue erosion hazard.
    (3) Eminent domain acquisition. A farm which includes land acquired 
by an agency having the right of eminent domain for which the entire 
tobacco allotment was pooled pursuant to part 718 of this chapter, which 
is subsequently returned to agricultural production shall not be 
eligible for a new farm allotment or marketing quota for a period of 5 
years from the date the former owner was displaced.
    (4) Farm includes land previously having a tobacco acreage 
allotment. A farm which includes land which has no tobacco allotment 
because the owner did not designate an allotment for such land when the 
parent farm was reconstituted pursuant to part 718 of this chapter shall 
not be eligible for a new farm acreage allotment for a period of 5 years 
beginning with the year in which the reconstitution became effective.
    (5) Entire quota sold. A new farm tobacco acreage allotment may not 
be established for a farm if, during the current year or the 4 preceding 
years, the farm was constituted as any part of a

[[Page 116]]

farm for which an acreage allotment or marketing quota had been 
established and for which the current or a former owner sold or 
permanently transferred all of the tobacco acreage allotment or 
marketing quota.
    (d) False information. Any new farm acreage allotment or marketing 
quota which was determined by the county FSA committee on the basis of 
incomplete or inaccurate information knowingly furnished by the 
applicant, shall be canceled by the county FSA committee as of the date 
the allotment or quota was established. When incomplete or inaccurate 
information was unknowingly furnished by the applicant, the allotment or 
quota shall be canceled effective for the current crop year.
    (e) Failure to plant. A new farm acreage allotment or marketing 
quota shall be reduced to zero if no tobacco is planted on the farm the 
first year.


<R05>
Sec. 723.208  Determination of acreage allotments, marketing quotas, and yields for divided farms.

    (a) Flue-cured tobacco. The farm acreage allotment for the divided 
farm shall be divided pursuant to the provisions of part 718 of this 
chapter. History acreages and other basic data shall be apportioned 
among the divided tracts as provided in part 718 of this chapter.
    (b) Burley tobacco. (1) Division of farm marketing quota. The farm 
marketing quota for the divided farm shall be divided according to part 
718 of this chapter. Other basic data shall be apportioned among the 
resulting farms in the same proportion as the farm marketing quota.
    (2) Divided burley tobacco farms with less than 1,000 pounds of 
quota. If a farm is divided through reconstitution and the burley 
tobacco poundage quota which transfers with the resulting farms receive 
less than 1,000 pounds of quota, the owners of such farms shall take 
action by July 1 of the current crop year to increase the quota to a 
minimum of 1,000 pounds or the quota shall be reduced to zero. The quota 
on the divided farms may be increased by:
    (i) Combining the farm having less than 1,000 pounds with other land 
owned by the same person so that the combined farm has a minimum of 
1,000 pounds of farm marketing quota, or
    (ii) Purchasing a sufficient amount of quota so that the farm has at 
least 1,000 pounds of quota.
    (3) Sale of Quota. If the owners of the divided farms fail to 
increase the quota on such farms to a minimum of 1,000 pounds as 
provided in paragraph (b)(2), the owner must sell the quota by July 1 of 
the current crop year.
    (4) Effective Quota. For the current crop year, the effective farm 
marketing quota on the divided farms shall be considered to be zero for 
leasing and planting purposes until the farm complies with the 1,000 
pound minimum quota.
    (5) Reduction of Quota. The county FSA committee shall reduce the 
quota to zero on the divided farms if the owners of such farms fail to 
take action as provided in paragraph (b)(2) and (3) of this section.
    (6) Farm Exemptions. Farms exempt from the 1,000 pound minimum quota 
limitation are farm divisions:
    (i) among immediate family members,
    (ii) through probate or,
    (iii) when no sale or change in ownership of land occurs or,
    (iv) when the buyer and purchaser can furnish proof acceptable to 
the county FSA committee, in accordance with guidelines provided by the 
Deputy Administrator, that the transaction was finalized prior to 
November 15, 1990.
    (v) when the individual tract or farm with less than 1,000 pounds of 
quota could be combined with another tract or farm with sufficient quota 
to reach 1,000 pounds but for the existence of a production flexibility 
contract on one of the farms.
    (c) Burley and flue-cured tobacco. (1) Tract yield. The tract yield 
for the tracts divided from a parent farm shall be the same as the tract 
yield established for the tracts before the division of the parent farm. 
If a tract is divided, the tract yields for the resulting tracts shall 
be the same as the tract yield established for the tract before it was 
divided.
    (2) Single tract farm. If a tract that is divided from a parent farm 
becomes a single tract farm, the tract yield shall

[[Page 117]]

become the preliminary farm yield and the farm yield for the farm shall 
be determined by multiplying the preliminary farm yield by the national 
yield factor for the current year.
    (3) Carryover tobacco. Where carryover tobacco produced on a parent 
farm is marketed after the effective date of a reconstitution, such 
marketings shall be charged to the divided tracts in the same ratio as 
the marketing quotas are established for the divided tracts or as the 
county FSA committee determines that:
    (i) The proceeds from such marketings are received by the owner or 
operator of one or more of the divided tracts, or
    (ii) The owners of the divided tracts agree.

<R05>
Sec. 723.209  Determination of acreage allotments, marketing quotas, yields for combined farms; and special tobacco combinations.

    (a) Burley tobacco. The farm yield for a combined burley farm shall 
be the weighted average of the tract yields for the tracts being 
combined. The weighted average shall be the summation of the extensions 
of each respective tract's contribution percentage times the tract's 
yield.
    (b) Flue-cured tobacco. Flue-cured farm acreage allotments, history 
acreages, and other basic data for combined farms shall be computed for 
the base period in accordance with part 718 of this chapter, except that 
the preliminary farm yield for a combined farm shall be the weighted 
average of the tract yields for the tracts that comprise the 
combination. The weighted average shall be the summation of the 
extensions of each respective tract's contribution percentage times the 
tract's yield. The farm yield for the combined farm shall be determined 
by multiplying the preliminary farm yield for the combined farm by the 
national yield factor for the current year.
    (c) Special tobacco combinations. Notwithstanding other provision of 
this title, the Deputy Administrator may, upon proper application and to 
the extent deemed consistent with other obligations, permit farms, with 
respect to tobacco allotments and tobacco quotas, to be considered 
combined for purposes of this part and part 1464 of this title only 
without being combined for other purposes. This allowance shall apply 
for tobacco of all kinds and types and with respect to all farms even if 
one or more of the farms to be combined is the subject of a production 
flexibility contract (PFC) executed in connection with the program 
operated under the provisions of 7 CFR part 1412. Such special, limited 
combinations must otherwise meet the requirements of 7 CFR part 718 for 
combinations, except the signature (consent) requirements of 
Sec. 718.201(a)(2) of that part. The Deputy Administrator may set such 
consent requirements for special farm combinations under this section as 
the Deputy Administrator believes necessary or appropriate. Further, in 
any case in which one of the farms is a PFC farm, none of the land on 
any PFC farm that would have been used for the production of tobacco can 
be used for the production of a ``PFC commodity'' as defined in this 
section. Such permission shall be conditioned upon the agreement of all 
interested parties that land on the PFC allotment or quota farm that 
would have been used for the production of tobacco shall not be used for 
the production of any PFC commodity. In the event that such production 
nonetheless occurs, the special tobacco combination may be made void, 
retroactive to the date of original approval. Such curative action will 
likely result in a finding of excess tobacco plantings and sanctions and 
remedies, which would likely include liability for penalties and other 
sanctions for excess marketings of tobacco. The Deputy Administrator may 
set such other conditions on the combinations as needed or deemed 
appropriate to serve the goals of the tobacco program and the goals of 
the PFC. The term PFC commodity for purposes of this section means 
wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley, oats, upland cotton, and rice.

<R05>
Sec. 723.210  Corrections of errors and adjusting inequities in acreage allotments and marketing quotas for old farms.

    (a)(1) General. The allotment or quota for a farm under a long-term 
land use program agreement shall be given the same consideration under 
this section as the allotment or quota for any other old farm. 
Notwithstanding the limitations contained in any other section of this 
part, the farm acreage allotment or marketing quota for each kind of 
tobacco established for an old farm may be increased to correct an error 
or adjust an inequity if the county FSA committee determines, with the 
approval of a representative of the State FSA committee, that the 
increase is necessary to establish an allotment or quota for such farm 
which is fair and equitable in relation to the allotment or quota for 
other old farms in the county in which the farm is located. Correction 
of errors shall be made out of that portion of the national reserve held 
at the national level.
    (2) Burley tobacco. The reserve for adjusting inequities under this 
paragraph will be prorated to States based on the relationship of the 
total of the preliminary farm marketing quotas in each State to the 
national total of preliminary farm marketing quotas.
    (3) All kinds of tobacco except burley tobacco. The reserve for 
adjusting inequities under this paragraph will be prorated to States 
based on the relationship of the total preliminary farm acreage 
allotments in each State to the national total of preliminary farm 
acreage allotments.
    (b) Basis for adjustment. Increases to adjust inequities in acreage 
allotments or marketing quotas shall be made on the basis of the past 
farm acreage, yields, and farm acreage allotments of tobacco, making due 
allowances for failed acreage and acreage prevented from being planted 
because of a natural disaster as determined under part 718 of this 
chapter; land, labor, and equipment available for the production of 
tobacco; crop rotation practices; and the soil and other physical 
factors affecting the production of tobacco. The total of all 
adjustments in old farm allotments or quotas under this paragraph shall 
not exceed the pounds apportioned to the county for such purpose.
    (c)(1) Burley tobacco. Adjustments in a farm marketing quota under 
this paragraph shall become a part of the farm marketing quota.
    (2) Flue-cured tobacco. Acreage apportioned to a farm under this 
section becomes a part of the farm acreage allotment. The farm marketing 
quota for such a farm shall be adjusted by multiplying the adjusted farm 
acreage allotment by the farm yield.
    (3) All other kinds of tobacco. For all other kinds of tobacco, 
acreage approved for a farm under this section becomes a part of the 
farm acreage allotment.
    (d) Making certain adjustments on a common ownership unit basis. 
Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, inequity adjustments 
may be allotted by common ownership unit rather than by farm when it is 
determined by the county FSA committee that the making of the allocation 
on that basis provides greater equity.

[55 FR 39914, Oct. 1, 1990, as amended at 63 FR 11582, Mar. 10, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 723.211  Allotments, quotas, and yields for farms acquired under right of eminent domain.

    (a) Determination of acreage allotments and marketing quotas. The 
determination of farm acreage allotments and marketing quotas for farms 
acquired by an agency having the right of eminent domain, the transfer 
of such allotments or quotas to a pool, and reallocation from the pool 
shall be administered as provided in part 718 of this chapter. Where all 
or a part of an allotment or quota is pooled, all or a proportionate 
part of the farm acreage allotment or marketing quota shall be pooled.
    (b) Closing dates. The State FSA committee shall establish, in 
accordance with instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator, a final 
date for:
    (1) Release. Releasing pooled farm acreage allotment or farm 
marketing quota to the county FSA committee for reapportionment to other 
farms in the county having allotments or quotas for the same kinds of 
tobacco.
    (2) Request for reapportionment. Filing a request to receive 
reapportioned

[[Page 119]]

acreage or quota from the county FSA committee for the current year.
    (c) Displaced owner release. The displaced owner of a farm may, not 
later than the final release date established by the State FSA committee 
for the current year, release in writing to the county FSA committee for 
the current year, all or any part of the acreage allotment or burley 
tobacco marketing quota for the farm in a pool under part 718 of this 
chapter for reapportionment for the current year by the county committee 
to other farms in the county having allotments or marketing quotas for 
the same kind of tobacco.
    (d) Reapportionment. The county FSA committee may reapportion, not 
later than 30 days after the final date established by the State FSA 
committee for requesting reapportioned acreage or marketing quota for 
the current year, the released acreage or quota or any part thereof to 
other farms in the county on the basis of the past farm acreage or 
marketings and the past farm acreage allotments or quotas for the same 
kind of tobacco; land, labor, and equipment available for the production 
of such kind of tobacco; crop rotation practices; and soil and other 
physical factors affecting the production of such kind of tobacco.
    (e) Effect of reapportionment. For purposes of establishing future 
farm allotments or quotas, any reapportioned allotment or quota shall 
not be considered as planted on the farm to which the allotment or quota 
was reapportioned.
    (f) Burley or flue-cured tobacco provisions. For burley or flue-
cured tobacco:
    (1) Farm yield. The farm yield for a farm to which a pooled 
marketing quota is transferred shall be determined in accordance with 
instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator.
    (2) Undermarketings or overmarketings. The undermarketings of a farm 
acquired by eminent domain shall be added to the marketing quota for the 
receiving farm and the overmarketings of the acquired farm shall be 
subtracted from the marketing quota of the receiving farm.
    (3) Undermarketings while in eminent domain pool. The pooled quota 
is considered planted while in the pool. Therefore, for the purpose of 
determining undermarketings during the time the quota is pooled, the 
effective quota is considered to be zero.


<R05>
Sec. 723.212  Time for making reduction of farm marketing quotas or acreage allotments for violation of the marketing quota or acreage allotment regulations for 
          a prior marketing year.

    Any reduction made in a farm acreage allotment or farm marketing 
quota for the current year for any of the reasons provided for in 
Sec. 723.408 of this part, shall be made no later than April 1 of the 
current year in the States of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, 
South Carolina, and Virginia; or May 1 in all other States. If the 
reduction cannot be made by such dates for the current year, the 
reduction shall be made in the farm acreage allotment or farm marketing 
quota next established for the farm, but no later than by corresponding 
dates in a later year. No reduction shall be made in the farm acreage 
allotment or farm marketing quota for any farm for a violation if the 
farm acreage allotment or marketing quota for such farm for any prior 
year was reduced because of the same violation.


<R05>
Sec. 723.213  Approval of acreage allotments and marketing quotas and notices to farm operators.

    (a) Review by State FSA committee. All farm yields, acreage 
allotments, and marketing quotas shall be determined by the county FSA 
committee of the county in which the farm is located and shall be 
reviewed by a representative of the State FSA committee.
    (b) Notice to farm operator. An official notice of the effective 
farm acreage allotment or farm marketing quota shall be mailed to the 
operator of each farm shown by the records of the county FSA committee 
to be entitled to an allotment or quota. The notice to the operator of 
the farm shall constitute notice to all persons who as operator, 
landlord, tenant, or sharecropper are interested in the farm for which 
the allotment or quota is established. Insofar as practicable, all 
notices shall be mailed in time to be received prior to the date of any 
tobacco marketing

[[Page 120]]

quota or acreage allotment referendum. A copy of such notice containing 
the date of mailing or a printout summary of such data shall be 
maintained for not less than 30 days in a conspicuous place in the 
county FSA office and shall thereafter be kept available for public 
inspection in the office of the county FSA committee. A copy of the 
notice of acreage allotment or marketing quota certified as true and 
correct shall be furnished to any person interested in the farm for 
which the allotment or quota is established.
    (c) Marketing quota erroneous notice. (1) If the official written 
notice of the farm acreage allotment and marketing quota issued for any 
farm erroneously stated an acreage allotment or marketing quota larger 
than the correct effective farm acreage allotment or marketing quota, 
the acreage allotment or marketing quota shown on the erroneous notice 
shall be deemed to be the tobacco acreage allotment or marketing quota 
for the farm for the current year only, if the county FSA committee 
determines (with the approval of the State Executive Director) that the:
    (i) Error was not so gross as to place the operator on notice 
thereof, and
    (ii) Operator, relying upon such notice and acting in good faith, 
materially changes the operator's position with respect to the 
production of the crop.
    (2) Undermarketings and overmarketings for farms for which the 
erroneous notice of marketing quota is applied shall be determined based 
on the correct effective farm marketing quota.
    (3) For purposes of determining history acreage the correct acreage 
allotment shall be used, in determining whether or not 75 percent of the 
allotment has been planted.

<R05>
Sec. 723.214  Application for review.

    Any producer who is dissatisfied with the farm acreage allotment and 
marketing quota established for the producer's farm may, within 15 days 
after mailing of the official notice of the farm acreage allotment and 
marketing quota, file application in writing with the county FSA office 
to have such allotment and marketing quota reviewed by a review 
committee in accordance with part 711 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 723.215  Transfer of tobacco farm acreage allotment or farm marketing quota that cannot be planted or replanted due to a natural disaster.

    (a) Designation of counties affected by a natural disaster. The 
State FSA committee shall determine those counties affected by a natural 
disaster (including but not limited to hurricane, rain, flash flood, 
hail, drought, and any other severe weather) which prevents the timely 
planting or replanting of any of the tobacco acreage allotment or 
marketing quota for any farm in the county. The county FSA committee of 
each county affected by the determination shall publicize the 
determination.
    (b) Application for transfer. The owner or operator of a farm in a 
county designated for any year under paragraph (a) of this section may 
file a written application for transfer of tobacco acreage with the farm 
acreage allotment or marketing quota for such year to another farm or 
farms in the same county or in any other nearby county in the same or 
another State if such acreage cannot be planted or replanted because of 
the natural disaster determined for such year. The application shall be 
filed with the county FSA committee for the county in which the farm 
affected by such disaster is located. If the application involves a 
transfer to a nearby county, the county FSA committee for the nearby 
county shall be consulted before action is taken by the county FSA 
committee receiving the application.
    (c)(1) Amount of burley tobacco transfer. The burley quota to be 
transferred shall not exceed the smaller of:
    (i) The effective farm quota established under this part less such 
quota planted to tobacco and not destroyed by the natural disaster, or
    (ii) The quota requested to be transferred.
    (2) Amount of transfer for other than burley tobacco. The allotment 
to be transferred shall not exceed the smaller of:

[[Page 121]]

    (i) The farm allotment established under this part less such acreage 
planted to tobacco and not destroyed by the natural disaster, or
    (ii) The allotment requested to be transferred.
    (d) County FSA committee approval. The county FSA committee shall 
approve the transfer if it finds that:
    (1) All or part of the farm acreage allotment or marketing quota for 
the transferring farm could not be timely planted or replanted because 
of the natural disaster.
    (2) One or more of the producers of tobacco on the transferring farm 
will be a bona fide producer engaged in the production of tobacco on the 
receiving farm and will share in the proceeds of the tobacco.
    (e) Cancellation of transfer. If a transfer is approved under this 
section and it is later determined that the conditions in paragraph (d) 
of this section have not been met, the county FSA committee, or the 
Deputy Administrator may cancel such transfer. Action by the county FSA 
committee to cancel a transfer shall be subject to the approval of the 
State FSA committee or its representative.
    (f) Acreage history credits. Any acreage transferred under this 
paragraph shall be considered for the purpose of determining future 
allotments or quotas to have been planted to tobacco on the farm from 
which such allotment or quota is transferred.
    (g) Closing dates. The closing date for filing applications for 
transfers with the county FSA committee shall be July 15 of the current 
year. Notwithstanding such closing date requirement, the county FSA 
committee may accept applications filed after the closing date upon a 
determination by the county FSA committee that the failure to timely 
file an application was the result of conditions beyond the control of 
the applicant and a representative of the State FSA committee approves 
such determination.


<R05>
Sec. 723.216  Transfer of tobacco acreage allotment or marketing quota by sale, lease, or owner.

    (a) General. The allotment or quota established for a farm may be 
transferred to another farm to the extent provided for in this section. 
For transfers by sale, common ownership units on a farm may be 
considered to be separate farms. Transfers are not permitted for cigar 
binder (types 54 and 55) tobacco allotments.
    (1) Types of transfers. With respect to:
    (i) Cigar-filler (type 46) and cigar-filler (types 42, 43, and 44), 
tobacco transfers may be by lease only.
    (ii) Flue-cured tobacco, transfers may be by:
    (A) Sale, or
    (B) Lease under certain natural disaster conditions provided in this 
section.
    (iii) Burley tobacco, transfers may be by:
    (A) Lease
    (B) Owner, or
    (C) Sale.
    (iv) Fire-cured, dark air-cured, and Virginia sun-cured tobacco, 
transfers may be by:
    (A) Lease,
    (B) Owner, or
    (C) Sale.
    (2) Transfer agreement. In order to transfer a marketing quota or 
allotment between two eligible farms, including a marketing quota or 
allotment that is pooled in accordance with part 718 of this chapter, 
the transfer must be recorded on Form FSA-375 and:
    (i) Where to file. Filed in the county FSA office which serves the 
county in which the transferring farm is located for administrative 
purposes.
    (ii) Signature-burley tobacco. Signed by, for burley tobacco only:
    (A) Leases. The owner and operator of the transferring farm and the 
owner or operator of the receiving farm. For leases made under the 
disaster provisions of this section, the signature of the owner of the 
transferring farm will not be required if the FSA determines that the 
farm is cash leased for the current crop year and that the owner does 
not share in the crop.
    (B) Sales. The owner of the selling farm and an active burley 
tobacco producer who is the buyer. If the buyer is neither owner nor 
operator of the farm to which the quota will be assigned, the owner or 
operator of the farm must give written consent for the quota to be 
assigned to the farm.

[[Page 122]]

    (C) Owner transfers. The owner of the transferring farm, who also 
must be the owner or operator of the receiving farm.
    (iii) Signature-flue-cured tobacco. Signed by, for flue-cured 
tobacco only:
    (A) Leases. The owner of the transferring farm and the owner or 
operator of the receiving farm. For leases made under the disaster 
provisions of this section, the signature of the owner of the 
transferring farm will not be required if the FSA determines that the 
farm is cash leased for the current crop year and that the owner does 
not share in the crop.
    (B) Sales. The owner of the selling farm and an active flue-cured 
tobacco producer who is the buyer. If the buyer is neither owner nor 
operator of the farm to which allotment and quota will be assigned, the 
owner or operator of the farm must be given written consent for the 
allotment and quota to be assigned to the farm.
    (iv) Signatures--except burley and flue-cured tobacco. Signed by, 
for all kinds of tobacco other than burley and flue-cured tobacco, the 
owner and operator of the transferring farm and the owner or operator of 
the receiving farm.
    (v) Witness. Each person whose signature is required by paragraphs 
(a)(2)(ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section must sign Form FSA-375 in the 
presence of a State or county FSA committee member or employee who shall 
sign Form FSA-375 as a witness, except that when both the owner and the 
operator of a transferring farm must sign, such witness is required for 
the signature of either the owner or operator, but not both. If such 
signatures cannot be witnessed in the county FSA office where the farm 
is administratively located, they may be witnessed in any State or 
county FSA office convenient to the owner or operator's residence. The 
requirement that signatures be witnessed for producers that are ill, 
infirm, reside in distant areas, or are in similar hardship situations 
or may be unduly inconvenienced may be waived provided the county FSA 
office mails Form FSA-375 for the required signatures;
    (b) Effective date. In order for the transfer to be effective for 
the current year, the Form FSA-375 shall be filed:
    (1) When to file--burley tobacco. For burley tobacco:
    (i) On or before July 1 of the current year, except as provided in 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. An agreement to transfer quota by 
lease may be considered to have been filed on July 1 of the current year 
if such transfer agreement is filed not later than the end of the 
marketing year that begins during the current year and the county FSA 
committee, with the concurrence of the State FSA committee, determines 
that on or before July 1 of the current year the lessee and lessor 
agreed to such lease and transfer of quota and the failure to file such 
transfer agreement did not result from gross negligence on the part of 
any party to such lease and transfer.
    (ii) After July 1 of the current crop year and before February 16 of 
the following calendar year when the transfer is by lease and the 
transferring farm has suffered a loss of production of burley tobacco 
due to hail, drought, excessive rain, wind, tornado, or other natural 
disasters as determined by the Deputy Administrator.
    (2) When to file--flue-cured tobacco. For flue-cured tobacco:
    (i) On or before June 15 if the transfer is by sale.
    (ii) After June 30 and on or before November 15 for a transfer by 
lease when the transferring farm has suffered a loss of production of 
flue-cured tobacco due to drought, excessive rain, hail, wind, tornado, 
or other natural disasters as determined by the Deputy Administrator.
    (3) When to file--except burley and flue-cured tobacco. For all 
other kinds of tobacco, by the date established by the State FSA 
committee, except that a lease shall be effective if the county FSA 
committee, with the approval of a State FSA committee representative, 
finds that the producer was prevented from timely filing the transfer 
agreement due to reasons beyond the control of the producer.
    (c) Approval or disapproval. A transfer agreement shall not be 
approved before the period for filing an application for review of the 
initial notice of allotment or quota has expired. The county FSA 
committee or its designee shall approve each transfer agreement that

[[Page 123]]

meets the eligibility requirements of this section. The county FSA 
committee shall disapprove any transfer agreement that does not meet the 
eligibility requirement of this section. Any approval or disapproval of 
a transfer agreement shall to the extent possible be made within 30 days 
after the transfer agreement is filed with the county FSA committee 
unless additional time is required as the result of conditions beyond 
the control of the county FSA committee. However;
    (1) Burley tobacco. If an agreement is filed after July 1 which 
provides for the sale of quota, a transfer agreement shall not be 
approved until the next year's quota is computed for the selling farm. 
In addition, if marketing quota referendum will be conducted to 
determine whether or not quotas will be in effect for the crop, a 
transfer agreement shall not be approved until the Secretary announces 
that quotas have been approved by referendum.
    (2) Flue-cured tobacco. If an agreement is filed after June 15 which 
provides for the sale of an allotment and quota, a transfer agreement 
shall not be approved until next year's allotment and quota is computed 
for the selling farm. In addition, if a marketing quota referendum will 
be conducted to determine whether or not quotas will be in effect for 
the crop, a transfer agreement shall not be approved until the Secretary 
announces that quotas have been approved by referendum.
    (d) Time of determination. An approved transfer agreement shall 
become effective for the then current crop year, except that if an 
agreement that is filed after June 15 for the sale of flue-cured tobacco 
quota or after July 1 for the sale of burley tobacco quota, such 
approved agreement shall become effective for the next crop year.
    (e) Burley tobacco. For burley tobacco only:
    (1) Basis for transfer by sale. If the transfer of a quota is by 
sale, the transfer shall be based on part or all of the farm poundage 
quota.
    (2) Basis for transfer by lease or owner. If the transfer of a quota 
is by lease or by the owner, transfer shall be based on a part of or all 
of the effective farm poundage quota.
    (3) Accumulation of quota. A transfer by lease or by owner shall not 
be approved if the county FSA committee determines that the primary 
purpose of the transfer is to accumulate the quota on the farm (i.e., 
alternately transferring to and from the farm for 2 or more years to 
maintain the quota without satisfactory evidence of plans for producing 
the quota on the receiving farm).
    (4) Subleasing. In order to determine whether there is any 
subleasing of a burley farm marketing quota, the current year is divided 
into two periods, the period up to and including July 1, and the period 
after July 1. The county FSA committee shall not approve a transfer 
during either period if the effect would be both a transfer to and from 
the farm during the same period. However, a transfer may be approved 
within any crop year if quota is transferred from a farm for one or more 
years and the farm subsequently is combined with another farm that 
otherwise is eligible to receive quota by lease or by the owner.
    (5) Transferring farm restrictions. An agreement to transfer quota 
from a farm by lease or by the owner shall not be approved:
    (i) Limitation. If the pounds of quota being transferred exceed the 
difference obtained by subtracting from the effective farm marketing 
quota the total pounds of quota purchased and/or reallocated from 
forfeited quota in the current and two preceding years, as adjusted to 
reflect changes in national quota factors which have occurred since each 
respective purchase and/or reallocation of quota. However, this 
provision shall not be applicable to transfer agreements that are filed 
after July 1.
    (ii) New farm. If the farm is a new farm.
    (iii) Reduction pending. If consideration of a marketing quota 
violation is pending which may result in a quota reduction for the farm 
for the current year. However, if the county FSA committee determines 
that a decision will not be made on the pending case on or before the 
date specified in Sec. 723.212 of this part, a 1-year transfer will be 
approved if otherwise eligible.

[[Page 124]]

    (iv) Filed on or before July 1. Unless the receiving farm is 
administratively located in the same county as the transferring farm. 
However, burley tobacco producers in the States of Tennessee, Ohio and 
Indiana shall, irrespective of the preceding sentence, be permitted to 
lease and transfer burley tobacco quota from one farm in a State to any 
other farm in the State if other conditions for the transfer are met.
    (v) Filed after July 1. If the transfer agreement is filed after 
July 1, unless the county FSA committee in the county in which the farm 
is located for administrative purposes determines that the:
    (A) Farm's expected production of burley tobacco is less than 80 
percent of the farm's effective marketing quota as a result of a flood, 
hail, wind, drought, excessive rain, tornado, or other natural disaster.
    (B) Acreage planted to burley tobacco on the farm was sufficient to 
produce, under average conditions, an amount of tobacco which, when 
added to any carryover tobacco from the previous marketing year, would 
equal the farm's effective farm marketing quota.
    (C) Lessor made reasonable and customary efforts to produce the 
effective farm marketing quota;
    (D) Producers on the farm qualify for price support in accordance 
with the provisions of part 1464 of this title; and
    (E) Receiving farm is administratively located in the same State as 
the transferring farm.
    (vi) Consent of lien holder. For a multiple year transfer, if the 
farm is subject to lien, unless the lien holder agrees in writing to the 
transfer; and
    (vii) Claim for marketing quota penalty. If a claim has been filed 
against the lessor for a tobacco marketing quota penalty and the claim 
remains unpaid; However, this provision shall not apply if the claim is 
paid or the entire proceeds of the lease of the quota are applied 
against the claim and the county FSA committee determines that the

(e)(5)(iv) of this section are not applicable.
    (B) If the pounds of quota being transferred to the farm exceed the 
smaller of 30,000 pounds or the difference between the farm marketing

July 1, unless the:
    (A) Producers on the farm qualify for price support in accordance 
with the provisions of part 1464 of this title; and
    (B) Pounds of quota to be transferred to the lessee farm do not 
exceed the difference obtained by subtracting the effective farm

lessee farm from the total pounds of tobacco marketed and/or available 
for marketing (based on estimated pounds of tobacco on hand and/or in 
the process of being produced) from the farm in the current year. 
However, the total quantity of tobacco that can be leased or transferred 
to a farm during a crop year may not exceed that quantity which equals 
15 percent of the effective quota on the farm prior to any leases or 
transfers filed after July 1 of the crop year.
    (C) Transferring farm is administratively located in the same State

    (A) The quota was purchased and/or reallocated to the farm during 
four preceding years; and
    (B) The county FSA committee, with the concurrence of a 
representative of the State FSA committee, determines that the failure

for the pounds of quota being sold.
    (vii) Consent of lien holder. Requires consent of the lien holder, 
if the farm is subject to a lien, unless the lien holder agrees in 
writing to the transfer. However, consent of a lien holder is not

disaster provisions of this section.
    (10) Redetermination of quota after transfer by lease or by the 
owner. After a transfer by lease or by the owner, the effective farm 
marketing quota shall be redetermined for both the transferring farm and 
the receiving farm.
    (11) Apportionment of data-selling farm. The pounds of farm 
marketing quota retained on the selling farm after the sale of quota 
shall be divided by the farm marketing quota established for the selling 
farm before the sale to determine a factor for apportioning farm data. 
The data to be retained on the selling farm shall be determined by 
multiplying the factor by the following data:
    (i) The amount of any overmarketings which have not been subtracted 
when a determination is made of the effective farm marketing quota of 
the selling farm;
    (ii) The pounds of quota which have been transferred from the 
selling farm by lease or by the owner in the current year;
    (iii) The pounds of quota which have been reduced in the current 
year as the result of a marketing quota violation in a prior year;

    (vi) The previous year's effective farm marketing quota.
    (12) Apportionment of data-buying farm. The buying farm's share of 
each respective item of farm data shall be determined by subtracting the 
pounds which are retained on the selling farm for the respective item 
from the pounds which were established for the selling farm for the 
respective item before the current sale of quota. However, the pounds of 
quota transferred from the selling farm by lease or by the owner and/or 
the pounds of quota reduction resulting from a marketing quota violation 
on the selling farm may be apportioned between the farms in accordance 
with a written agreement between the buyer and the seller if the farm 
marketing quota retained on the selling farm is sufficient to satisfy 
the pounds of quota which were transferred by lease or by the owner, the 
pounds of quota which have been reduced as the result of a marketing 
quota violation, and the overmarketings for the farm, if any. The data 
determined in accordance with this paragraph shall he added to any 
previous data for the buying farm.
    (13) Redetermination quota after sale or purchase of quota. After 
adjusting the data in accordance with the provisions of this section, 
the effective farm marketing quota shall be determined for both the 
buying and selling farm.
    (14) Farm division after transfer by lease. If a farm is divided 
after there has been a transfer of a marketing quota to the farm by 
lease, the transferred quota shall be divided in the manner which is 
designated in writing by the lessee. In the absence of a written 
designation, the leased quota shall be apportioned in the same manner as 
the farm marketing quota of the parent farm.
    (15) Multiple year transfer by lease or by owner. The effective farm 
marketing quota on a receiving farm having a multiple-year transfer 
agreement in effect shall be adjusted for each year for which such 
transfer agreement is in effect to reflect any decrease in the national 
quota factor which causes the farm marketing quota established for the 
transferring farm to be less than the pounds of quota which have been 
transferred to the receiving farm.
    (16) Considered planted credit. Considered planted credit shall be 
given to the transferring farm when tobacco quota is transferred from 
the farm by lease or by owner.
    (f) Flue-cured tobacco. For flue-cured tobacco only:
    (1) Location of buying and selling farms. Marketing quota 
transferred by sale must be to a farm administratively located within 
the same county. However, beginning with the 2002 and subsequent crops, 
flue-cured tobacco owners in the States of Florida and Georgia shall be 
permitted to sell flue-cured tobacco marketing quota to any other farm 
in their respective State if all other conditions for such a sale are 
met.
    (2) Maximum quota to be transferred by sale. If the transfer is by 
sale, the

[[Page 127]]

transfer shall be based on part or all of the farm poundage quota. the 
maximum quota that may be transferred by sale is the farm poundage 
quota.
    (3) Transfer by lease-involvement of outside parties. If the 
transfer is by lease, only the lessor and lessee (or any attorney, 
trustee, bank, or other agent who regularly represents either the lessor 
or lessee in business transactions unrelated to the production or 
marketing of tobacco) may be parties to, or involved in the arrangements 
for such transfer. The transfer shall be based on a portion or all of 
the effective farm poundage quota. The maximum quota that may be 
transferred by lease is the effective farm poundage quota.

lease shall not be approved:
    (i) New farm. If the farm is a new farm.
    (ii) Natural disaster. Unless the county FSA committee in the county 
in which the farm is located for administrative purposes determines that 
the:
    (A)(1) The farm has planted an acreage equal to or more than 90 
percent of the effective farm acreage allotment, or
    (2) In accordance with guidelines issued by the Deputy 
Administrator, the planted acreage of flue-cured tobacco on the farm is 
sufficient to produce, under average conditions, an amount of tobacco 
which, when added to any carryover tobacco from the previous marketing 
year, would equal the farm's effective farm marketing quota;
    (B) Lessor made reasonable and customary efforts to produce the 
effective farm marketing quota;
    (C) Producers on the farm qualify for price support in accordance 
with the provisions of part 1464 of this title; and
    (D) Farm's expected production of flue-cured tobacco is less than 80 
percent of the farm's effective marketing quota as a result of a 
drought, excessive rain, hail, wind, tornado, or other natural disaster 
as determined by the Deputy Administrator.
    (iii) Claim for tobacco marketing quota penalty. If a claim has been 
filed against the lessor for tobacco marketing quota penalty and the 
claim remains unpaid unless the claim is paid or the entire proceeds of 
the lease of the allotment and quota are applied against the claim and 
the county FSA committee determines that the amount of the lease 
represents a reasonable price for the pounds of quota being leased.
    (iv) Located in the same State. Unless the lessor farm is 
administratively located in the same State as the lessee farm.
    (5) Lessee farm restrictions. A transfer of quota to a farm by lease

reallocation became effective in the current or any of the three 
preceding years. However, this provision shall not be applicable if:
    (A)(1) The quota being sold was purchased in such period, if 
forfeiture of such quota is required by Sec. 723.220 of this part, and 
the amount of quota being transferred does not exceed the amount of 
quota for which forfeiture otherwise is required in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 723.220 of this part; or
    (2) The county FSA committee, with the concurrence of a 
representative of the State FSA committee, determines that the failure

    (E) The owner of the quota is sharing in the risk of production as 
an investing producer and loses resources necessary to produce the crop 
due to reasons beyond such owner's control such as the loss of a tenant 
or share cropper and a replacement cannot be obtained.
    (ii) Reduction pending. If consideration of an indicated violation 
is pending which may result in an allotment and quota reduction for the 
farm for the current year. However, if the county FSA committee 
determines that a decision will not be made on the pending case on or

lien holder is not required for a transfer of the pounds of quota for 
which forfeiture is required in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 723.220 of this part.
    (v) Claim for marketing quota penalty. If a claim has been filed 
against the seller for a tobacco marketing quota penalty and the claim 
remains unpaid: However, this provision shall not be applicable if the 
claim for such penalty is paid or the entire proceeds of the sale of the 
allotment and quota are applied against the claim and the county FSA 
committee determines that the amount paid represents a reasonable 
selling price for the pounds of quota being sold.
    (vi) Allotment and quota subject to an approved Conservation Reserve 
Program contract. If the allotment and quota is subject to an approved 
Conservation Reserve Program contract, unless forfeiture otherwise would 
be required in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 723.220 of this 
part.

    (iv) Installment payment option. Unless the buyer of the flue-cured 
tobacco acreage allotment and marketing quota has been afforded an 
option to pay for such allotment and quota in two to five equal annual 
installments payable each fall beginning with the fall of the crop year 
in which the transfer becomes effective and such buyer certifies on a 
form prescribed by the Deputy Administrator that such option has been 
made available to the buyer.
    (8) Allotment and quota after transfer by lease. The effective farm 
acreage allotment and the effective farm marketing quota shall be 
determined for both the lessee farm and the lessor farm in accordance 
with the provisions of Secs. 723.205 and 723.206 of this part, 
respectively.
    (9) Apportionment of data after transfer of quota by sale-selling 
farm. The pounds of farm marketing quota retained on the selling farm 
after the sale of quota shall be divided by the farm marketing quota 
established for the selling farm before the sale to determine a factor 
for apportioning farm data for the current year and for the base period. 
The data to be retained on the selling farm shall be determined by 
multiplying the factor by the following data:
    (i) The planted and considered planted acres for the base period;
    (ii) The history acres for the base period;
    (iii) The farm acreage allotment for the current year and for the 
base period;

[[Page 129]]

of the effective farm marketing quota of the selling farm;
    (v) The pounds of quota which have been transferred from the selling 
farm by lease in the current year;
    (vi) The acres of allotment which have been reduced in the current 
year as the result of a marketing quota violation in a prior year;

    (10) Apportionment of data-buying farm. The pounds of farm marketing 
quota which have been purchased shall be divided by the farm yield for 
the buying farm in order to determine the farm acreage allotment for the 
buying farm. The buying farm's share of other farm data shall be 
determined by subtracting the acres or pounds, as applicable, which are 
retained on the selling farm from the acres or pounds which were 
established for the selling farm before the current sale of quota: 
However, the acres computed for the acres of reduction resulting from a 
marketing quota violation for the buying farm shall be multiplied by a 
factor determined by dividing the farm yield of the selling farm by the 
farm yield of the buying farm in order to determine the acres of 
reduction from the buying farm for the current year. The pounds of quota 
transferred from the selling farm by lease and/or the acres of allotment 
reduction resulting from a marketing quota violation on the selling farm 
may be apportioned between the farms in accordance with a written 
agreement between the buyer and the seller if the farm marketing quota 
retained on the selling farm is sufficient to satisfy the pounds of 
quota which are leased, the pounds of quota which have been reduced as 
the result of a marketing quota violation, and the overmarketings for 
the farm, if any. The data determined in accordance with this paragraph 
shall be added to any previous data for the buying farm.
    (11) Allotment and quota. After adjusting the data in accordance 
with the provisions of this section, the farm acreage allotment, the 
effective farm acreage allotment, and the effective farm marketing quota 
shall be determined for both the buying and the selling farm.
    (12) Effect of price support eligibility. If a lease agreement is 
filed after the farm operator reports the acreage of tobacco on the farm 
in the current year, the effective farm acreage allotment which has been 
determined prior to the approval of the transfer will be used in 
determining price support eligibility for the farm.
    (13) Violation of lease provisions. (i) If, after a lease agreement 
is approved, information is brought to the attention of the county FSA 
committee which indicates that either the lessor or the lessee, or both, 
knowingly filed a false certification with respect to a transfer of 
quota by lease, the county FSA committee shall schedule a hearing, 
notify such person of the time and place of the hearing, and present 
evidence at the hearing with respect to the allegation of false 
certification. If, as a result of the evidence presented, the county FSA 
committee determines that such person knowingly made a false 
certification, the county FSA committee shall notify the person of the 
determination and afford such person 15 days after the mailing of the 
notice to request a review of the determination by a review committee as 
provided for by part 711 of this chapter.
    (ii) If it is determined that the lessor knowingly made a false 
certification, the next flue-cured tobacco acreage allotment and 
marketing quota established for the lessor's farm shall be reduced by 
that percentage which the leased quota was of the total flue-cured 
tobacco farm marketing quota established for the farm in the year of the 
lease.
    (iii) If it is determined that the lessee knowingly made a false 
certification, the lease agreement for purposes of the flue-cured 
tobacco marketing quota program with respect to the lessee's farm shall 
be considered to be null and void as of the date approved by the county 
FSA committee.
    (14) Considered planted credit. Considered planted credit shall be 
given to the lessor farm for the tobacco acreage

[[Page 130]]

allotment which is deducted as the result of the transfer of quota from 
the farm by lease.
    (15) Sale of quota with installment payment option. Notwithstanding 
any other provision of this section the owner of a farm who sells any 
flue-cured tobacco acreage allotment and marketing quota may:
    (i) Negotiate with more than one prospective buyer before selling 
such allotment and quota; or
    (ii) Sell such allotment and quota to any eligible buyer whom such 
owner may select; or
    (iii) Sell such allotment and quota for a single payment; or
    (iv) Include provisions in the agreement of sale to protect the 
seller's interest if the buyer fails to make full payment. Such 
provisions may not include the use of such allotment and quota as 
collateral for purposes of protecting the seller's interest in the 
allotment and quota.
    (v) Flue-cured tobacco acreage allotment and marketing quota 
purchased in accordance with this subparagraph shall not revert to the 
seller's farm but shall remain with the farm to which assigned at the 
time of purchase even though the buyer fails to make full payment to the 
seller for such allotment and quota.
    (g) Burley and flue-cured tobacco. For burley or flue-cured tobacco:
    (1) Carryover tobacco. If tobacco is marketed after the entire farm 
marketing quota of the producing farm has been transferred by sale, the 
tobacco shall be considered as having been marketed on each farm to 
which farm marketing quota was transferred by sale in accordance with a 
transfer agreement filed after June 15 for flue-cured tobacco, or July 1 
for burley tobacco, of the last year in which a farm marketing quota was 
established for the producing farm. Such marketing shall be prorated to 
each farm in proportion to the pounds of farm poundage quota purchased 
by each farm. If there was more than one farm to which a farm marketing 
quota was transferred by sale, the marketing may be assigned to the 
farms in the manner agreed to in writing by each of the buyers of such 
farm marketing quota.
    (2) Cancellation of transfer. A transfer of flue-cured allotment and 
quota, or burley quota, under this section which was approved in error 
or on the basis of incorrect information furnished by the parties to the 
agreement shall be canceled by the county FSA committee. For the purpose 
of determining any overmarketings and undermarketings from the farms, 
and for the purpose of determining eligibility for price support and 
marketing quota penalties, the cancellation shall be effective as of the 
date of approval. However, such cancellation shall not be effective for 
the current marketing year for price support and marketing quota penalty 
purposes if the:
    (i) Transfer approval was made in error or on the basis of incorrect 
information which had been unknowingly furnished by the parties to the 
agreement; and
    (ii) Parties to the transfer agreement were not notified of the 
cancellation before the marketing for the receiving farm exceeded the 
correct effective farm marketing quota.
    (3) Canceled because of fraud. If a transfer of a flue-cured 
allotment and quota, or burley quota, is canceled because of fraud on 
the part of the owner of the transferring farm but no fraud is 
attributable to either the owner or operator of the receiving farm, such 
cancellation shall be effective as of the date of approval of the 
transfer except for purposes of determining eligibility for price 
support and marketing quota penalties for the receiving farm. In such 
case, the overmarketings shall be charged against the farm from which 
the transfer was made if the farm, after any reconstitution which may be 
necessary as a result of fraud, is assigned a flue-cured allotment and 
quota, or burley quota, against which the overmarketings could be 
charged. Otherwise, the overmarketings shall be charged against any 
other farm involved in the fraud having a flue-cured allotment and 
quota, or burley quota, after any reconstitution required by such fraud. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any overmarketings on the receiving farm 
which are in excess of the amount of quota involved in the canceled 
transfer shall be charged against the receiving farm.

[[Page 131]]

    (4) Dissolution or revision of a transfer agreement. A transfer 
agreement may be dissolved or minor revisions made with respect to such 
agreement if a written request by all parties to the agreement is made 
to the county FSA committee by November 15 of the current marketing year 
for flue-cured tobacco, or by February 15 of the current marketing year 
for burley tobacco. After any such dissolution or revision of a transfer 
agreement, an official notice of the flue-cured acreage allotment and 
marketing quota, or burley quota, shall be issued by the county FSA 
committee to each of the operators involved in the transfer agreement.
    (h) Cigar tobacco. For cigar-filler (type 46) and cigar-filler 
(types 42, 43, and 44) tobacco only, the provisions of paragraph (j) of 
this section are applicable in addition to the following:
    (1) Farm eligible. The owner and operator (acting together if 
different person) of any farm for which an old farm tobacco acreage 
allotment is established for the current year may lease and transfer all 
or any part of the farm acreage allotment established for such farm to 
any other owner or operator of a farm in the same county with a current 
year's allotment (old or new farm) for the same kind of tobacco for use 
on such farm. Transfer of allotments by lease shall not exceed 5 years.
    (2) Transfer approved acre per acre. The lease and transfer shall be 
approved acre per acre.
    (3) Considered planted credit. The amount of allotment acreage which 
is leased from a farm shall be considered for the purpose of determining 
future allotments (and tobacco history acreage) to have been planted to 
tobacco on such farm. The amount of allotment acreage which is leased 
and transferred to a farm shall not be taken into account in 
establishing allotments for subsequent years for such farms.
    (4) Limitation on acreage transferred. The total acreage allotted to 
any farm after the transfer by lease of tobacco acreage allotment to the 
farm shall not exceed 50 percent of the acreage of cropland in the farm, 
except that in the case of cigar-filler (types 42, 43, 44, and 46) 
transfers, such transfers shall be limited to a total of 10 acres.
    (5) Transfer from the pool. Allotments in a pool pursuant to part 
718 of this chapter may be eligible for lease and transfer during the 3-
year life of the pooled allotment. An agreement to lease and transfer 
shall not serve to extend the life of such pooled allotment.
    (i) Fire-cured, Dark air-cured, and Virginia sun-cured tobacco. For 
Fire-cured, Dark air-cured, and Virginia sun-cured tobacco, only, the 
provisions of this section are applicable in addition to the following:
    (1) Persons eligible to file a record of transfer (FSA-375)--sale or 
lease. The owner and operator of any old farm for which a Fire-cured, 
Dark air-cured, or Virginia sun-cured tobacco allotment is established 
for the current year may sell or lease all or any part of such allotment 
to any other owner or operator of a farm in the same county, and in the 
same State for Virginia fire-cured (type 21) or Virginia sun-cured (type 
37) tobaccos. The receiving farm need not be an old farm. In the case of 
a permanent transfer, a statement signed by all parties to the 
transaction confirming that the sale has been made shall be filed with 
the county FSA committee.
    (2) By owner. The owner of any old tobacco farm for which a Fire-
cured, Dark air-cured, or Virginia sun-cured tobacco allotment is 
established for the current year may transfer any or all of such 
allotment permanently, or for a term of years designated by the owner, 
to another farm in the same county (within the same State for Virginia 
fire-cured and Virginia sun-cured tobacco) owned or controlled by such 
owner.
    (3) Maximum period of transfer by lease. Transfer of allotments by 
lease shall not exceed 5 years.
    (4) Basis for transfer. The transfer shall be approved acre for 
acre.
    (5) Adjustments in farm history acreage. The farm history acreage 
for the immediately preceding 5 years on farms from which and to which 
permanent transfer of allotment is made shall be adjusted by the county 
FSA committee for each of the base years to correspond with the amount 
of allotment transferred between the farms. In the case of temporary 
transfers of allotment for 1 or more years by lease or by owner, the

[[Page 132]]

farm history acreage shall not be reduced on the farm from which the 
transfer is made and farm history acreage shall not be transferred to 
the receiving farm.
    (6) Limitation on acreage transferred. The total of the Fire-cured, 
Dark air-cured, or Virginia sun-cured tobacco allotment which may be 
transferred for each kind of tobacco, by sale, lease, or by owner, to a 
farm shall not exceed 50 percent of the acreage of cropland on the farm. 
The cropland in the farm for the current year for purposes of such 
transfers shall be the total cropland as defined in Part 718 of this 
chapter.
    (7) Prohibition on permanent transfer. A permanent transfer by sale 
or by owner shall not be approved from any farm to which an allotment 
was permanently transferred by sale or by owner within the 3 immediately 
preceding crop years.
    (8) Temporary transfer to non-owned farm. A transfer requested on a 
temporary basis to a farm controlled but not owned by the applicant 
shall be approved only if the applicant will be the operator of the farm 
to which the transfer is to be made for each year of the period for 
which the transfer is requested. When the applicant for whom such 
transfer has been approved no longer is the operator of the receiving 
farm due to conditions beyond such operator's control, the transfer 
shall remain in effect unless the transfer is terminated under the 
provisions of paragraph (j) of this section. Conditions beyond the 
operator's control shall include, but not be limited to, death, illness, 
incompetence, or bankruptcy of such person.
    (9) Transfer of pooled allotment. Allotments established for a farm 
as pooled allotment under part 718 of this chapter may be transferred on 
a:
    (i) Permanent basis during the 3-year life of a pooled allotment, or
    (ii) Temporary basis for a term of years not to exceed the remaining 
number of crop years of such 3-year period. A temporary agreement to 
transfer shall not serve to extend the life of such pooled allotment.
    (10) New farm eligibility. Any farm from which the entire farm 
allotment is sold or permanently transferred by the owner shall not be 
eligible for a new farm tobacco allotment for the kind transferred 
during the 5 years following the year in which such transfer is made.
    (11) Transfer of history acreage. Permanent transfer of allotment 
shall have the effect of transferring history acreage, farm base, and 
marketing quota attributable to such allotment. In the case of a 
transfer by lease, the transferred allotment shall be considered for 
purposes of establishing future allotments to have been planted on the 
farm from which such allotment was transferred.
    (j) Tobacco except burley, flue-cured, and cigar (types 54 and 55). 
For tobacco that may be transferred in accordance with the provisions of 
paragraph (h) or (i) of this section, the following provisions shall 
also apply:
    (1) New farm allotment. A new farm allotment shall not be 
transferred.
    (2) Tobacco allotment subject to an approved Conservation Reserve 
Program contract. A transfer of allotment designated for reduction under 
a Conservation Reserve Program contract shall not be approved.
    (3) Subleasing prohibited. A transfer of allotment from a farm shall 
not be approved during the period for which a current temporary transfer 
agreement is in effect that transferred quota to the same farm.
    (4) Limitation on transfer to and from a farm in the same year. If a 
transfer agreement is in effect for the current crop year for a farm, a 
transfer of allotment shall not be approved during the same crop year:
    (i) From such farm receiving allotment by transfer for such year, or
    (ii) To such farm which had allotment transferred from it for such 
year.
    (5) Farm in violation. If consideration of a violation is pending 
which may result in an allotment reduction for a farm for the current 
year, the county FSA committee shall delay approval of any transfer of 
allotment from or to the farm until the violation is cleared or the 
allotment reduction is made. However, if the allotment reduction in such 
case cannot be made effective for the current crop year before the final 
date for reducing allotments for violations, the transfer may be 
approved by the county FSA committee. In any

[[Page 133]]

case, if, after a transfer of a tobacco acreage allotment has been 
approved by the county FSA committee, it is determined that the 
allotment for the farm from which or to which such acreage is 
transferred is to be reduced for a violation, the allotment reduction 
for such farm shall be delayed until the following year.
    (6) Claim for tobacco marketing quota penalty. A transfer of acreage 
allotment from a farm shall not be approved if a claim has been filed 
against the lessor, seller, or transferring owner for a tobacco 
marketing quota penalty and the claim remains unpaid. However, this 
provision shall not apply if the claim is paid or the entire proceeds of 
the lease or sale of the allotment are applied against the claim and the 
county FSA committee determines that the amount paid for the lease or 
sale represents a reasonable price for the acres of allotment being 
transferred.
    (7) Approval after review period. A transfer of allotment shall not 
be approved by the county FSA committee for any farm before the time of 
filing an application for review, as shown on the original allotment 
notice for the farm, has expired. If an application for review is filed 
for a farm involved in a transfer agreement, such agreement shall not be 
approved by the county FSA committee until the allotment for such farm 
is finally determined pursuant to part 711 of this chapter.
    (8) Acreage allotment after lease and transfer. The acreage 
allotment determined after a temporary transfer for a farm under the 
provisions of this section shall be the allotment of such farm for the 
current year only for the purpose of determining:
    (i) Excess acreage,
    (ii) The amount of penalty to be collected on marketings of excess 
tobacco including absorption of carryover penalty tobacco,
    (iii) Eligibility for price support, and
    (iv) The farm marketing quota and the percentage reduction for a 
violation in the allotment for the farm.
    (9) Cancellation of transfer. Any transfer of allotment under this 
section which was approved by the county FSA committee in error or on 
the basis of incorrect information furnished by the parties to the 
agreement shall be canceled by the county FSA committee. Such 
cancellation shall be effective as of the date of approval for purposes 
of determining eligibility for price support and marketing quota 
penalties except that such cancellation shall not be effective for the 
current marketing year for price support and marketing quota penalty 
purposes, if:
    (i) The transfer approval was made in error or on the basis of 
incorrect information unknowingly furnished by the parties to the 
transfer agreement; and
    (ii) The parties to the transfer agreement were not notified of the 
cancellation before the tobacco was planted.
    (10) Dissolution or revision. A transfer agreement may be dissolved 
or minor revisions made where a request by all parties to the agreement 
is made in writing to the county FSA committee. Such written 
notification shall be filed prior to planting the tobacco. A late filed 
request to dissolve or revise the transfer may be effective for the 
current year if the county FSA committee with approval of a 
representative of the State FSA committee determines that the producer 
was prevented from timely filing for reasons beyond such producer's 
control.
    (11) Reconstituted farm. The allotment for a farm being divided or 
combined in the current year shall be the allotment after the transfer 
has been approved. Notwithstanding the above, in the case of a division, 
the county FSA committee shall allocate the acreage that was transferred 
by lease to the tracts involved in the division as the parent farm 
owners and operators designate in writing. In the absence of such 
designation, the county FSA committee shall apportion the leased 
acreage.
    (12) Consent of lien holder. A transfer of allotment other than by 
annual lease shall not be approved from a farm subject to a mortgage or 
other lien unless the transfer is agreed to in writing by the lien 
holder.

Sec. 723.217  Release and reapportionment of old farm acreage allotments for Cigar-filler and Binder (types 42, 43, 44, 54, and 55) tobacco.

    (a) Annual or permanent release of acreage allotments to State 
committee. Except as provided in this paragraph, all or any part of a 
farm acreage allotment on which Cigar-filler and Binder (types 42, 43, 
44, 54, and 55) tobacco will not be produced and which the operator of 
the farm voluntarily releases on an annual basis, or both the owner and 
operator voluntarily releases on a permanent basis, in writing to the 
State FSA committee by not later than the final date for filing releases 
established by the State FSA committee for the current year shall be 
deducted from the allotment of such farm.
    (1) For the farm voluntarily releasing tobacco farm acreage 
allotment on an annual basis, such acreage will be considered as having 
been planted on the releasing farm for the purpose of establishing 
allotments for subsequent years. For the farm receiving such annual 
released acreage, such acreage shall not be taken into account in 
establishing future allotments for the farm. The tobacco history acreage 
for a farm releasing on a permanent basis shall not be taken into 
account in establishing future allotments for the farm. The tobacco 
history acreage for a farm releasing on a permanent basis shall be 
adjusted to reflect the acreage permanently released.
    (2) An acreage allotment shall not be released either annually or 
permanently:
    (i) From the eminent domain allotment pool if an application for 
transfer from the pool has been filed in accordance with part 718 of 
this chapter;
    (ii) From a new farm; or
    (iii) To the extent such acreage is designated for reduction under a 
Conservation Reserve Program contract.
    (b) Reapportionment of released acreage allotment. The acreage 
voluntarily released on an annual or permanent basis for the current 
year may be reapportioned by the State FSA committee to any farm in any 
county in the State including a farm receiving a new farm allotment. The 
State FSA committee shall select the counties to which the released 
acreage will be reapportioned. The county FSA committee shall select the 
farms to which the released acreage will be reapportioned. The State FSA 
committee shall keep records on both an annual and permanent basis of 
the source of acreage released. Any acreage released for the current 
year on a permanent basis which is not reapportioned by the State FSA 
committee in the current year may be reapportioned in the following 
year. The county FSA committee for the county receiving released acreage 
may reapportion the tobacco allotment acreage on an annual or permanent 
basis to other farms in the county in amounts determined by the county 
FSA committee to be fair and reasonable on the basis of land, labor, and 
equipment available for production of Cigarfiller and binder (types 42, 
43, 44, 54, and 55) tobacco; crop rotation practices; and the soil and 
other physical factors affecting the production of tobacco. Released 
acreage should not be reapportioned on a temporary or permanent basis to 
any farm unless there is assurance from the operator to the county FSA 
committee that the released acreage being received will be produced. 
Allotment reapportioned to a farm on an annual basis can only be used by 
the receiving farm for increased production during the current year. 
Allotment reapportioned to a farm on a permanent basis shall be added to 
the current year allotment or shall serve to establish an allotment for 
a farm without a current allotment. A farm shall be eligible to receive 
reapportionment of released acreage on either or both an annual or 
permanent basis only if a written request is filed by the farm owner or 
operator at the office of the county FSA committee not later than the 
final date for filing such requests established by the State FSA 
committee for the current year.


<R05>
Sec. 723.218  Determining tobacco history acreage.

    With respect to each respective kind of tobacco, the tobacco history 
acreage shall be determined for each farm for which a tobacco acreage 
allotment was established for such kind of tobacco for the current year.

[[Page 135]]

    (a) The history acreage shall be the same as the farm acreage 
allotment for the respective kind of tobacco if in the current year, or 
either of the two preceding years, the sum of the planted and considered 
planted acreage of such kind of tobacco was as much as 75 percent of the 
farm acreage allotment. Otherwise, the history acreage shall be the sum 
of the planted and considered planted acreage of such kind of tobacco.
    (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, for the 
respective kind of tobacco, the history acres for the current year and 
for each year of the base period shall be reduced to zero if:
    (1) A new farm allotment was canceled;
    (2) The allotment was in a pool established in accordance with the 
eminent domain provision of part 718 of this chapter and the period of 
eligibility has expired for transferring the allotment from the pool; or
    (3) The county FSA committee determines that the farm has been 
retired from agricultural production and the allotment is not eligible 
for pooling in accordance with the eminent domain provisions of part 718 
of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 723.219  Forfeiture of burley tobacco marketing quota.

    (a) Determination of quota subject to forfeiture. (1) For purposes 
of paragraph (b) of this section, the phrase ``owns a farm'' means 
ownership of:
    (i) A farm as constituted under part 718 of this chapter, if the 
entire farm shares a common ownership; or
    (ii) All of the land within a farm which shares a common ownership 
if the parent farm consists of tracts of land having separate 
ownerships.
    (2) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the county FSA 
committee shall apportion, in accordance with the provisions of part 718 
of this chapter, the burley tobacco quota assigned to a farm between the 
various tracts of land which are separately owned by:
    (i) A person not using the land on the farm for which a burley 
tobacco marketing quota is established for agricultural purposes.
    (ii) A person who uses the land on the farm for which the burley 
tobacco marketing quota is established for agricultural purposes or for 
educational, instructional, or demonstrational purposes.
    (3) The farm marketing quota determined under this section for each 
farm or tract, as applicable, shall be the amount of quota subject to 
forfeiture under this section.
    (b) Person who does not use the land on the farm for which the 
marketing quota is established for agricultural purposes or does not use 
such marketing quota for educational, instructional, or demonstrational 
purposes. For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``person'' means a 
person as defined in part 718 of this chapter, including any 
governmental entity, public utility, educational institution, religious 
institution or joint venture (but not including any farming operation 
involving only spouses), but excluding any individual.
    (1) Required forfeiture. With respect to any person owning a farm 
for which a burley tobacco marketing quota is established, if the county 
FSA committee determines that such person does not use the land on such 
farm for agricultural purposes, or does not use such burley tobacco 
marketing quota for educational, instructional, or demonstrational 
purposes, such person shall forfeit such quota which is not sold on or 
before December 1 of the year after any year for which the county FSA 
committee makes such determination.
    (2) Agricultural purposes. Land on the farm for which a burley 
tobacco marketing quota is established shall be considered to be used 
for agricultural purposes if the county FSA committee determines that:
    (i) In the current year or either of the 2 preceding years such land 
is used for the production of:
    (A) Row crops of any type;
    (B) Livestock or poultry (including pasture and forage for 
livestock);
    (C) Trees (including orchards and vineyards); or
    (D) Hay or native grasses on open land; or
    (ii) In the current year such farm is owned by an educational 
institution

[[Page 136]]

which uses such burley tobacco marketing quota solely for educational, 
instructional, or demonstrational purposes.
    (3) Documentation. Within 30 days after a written request is made by 
the county FSA committee, or within such extended time as may be granted 
by the county FSA committee, a person must submit such documentation as 
may be requested to support a determination that the provisions of 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section have been met with respect to such 
person. Upon failure of such person to timely respond to this request, 
the county FSA committee shall determine that the person does not use 
the land on the farm for agricultural purposes, or does not use the 
burley tobacco marketing quota for educational, instructional, or 
demonstrational purposes.
    (c) Buyers of quota fail to share in the risk of production.
    (1) Forfeiture required. If any person buys burley tobacco quota and 
such person fails to share in the risk of producing the tobacco which 
was planted subject to such quota during any of the 3 crop years 
beginning with the crop year for which the purchase became effective, 
such person shall forfeit the purchased quota if it is not sold on or 
before December 31 of the year after the crop year in which such crop 
was planted. However, any purchaser or subsequent purchaser of quota 
required to be sold under the mandatory sale to prevent forfeiture, 
provisions of paragraph (b) of this section shall be required to share 
in the risk of production of such quota for five crop years beginning 
with the crop year for which the purchase became effective.
    (2) Failure to utilize purchased quota for the production of tobacco 
shall not result in the forfeiture of such quota, but the three year 
period and the five year period which is specified in paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section shall be extended 1 year for each year for which the 
quota is not utilized.
    (3) Reduction for failure to share in the risk of production. The 
effective quota shall be reduced, but not below zero pounds, for leasing 
and marketing quota purposes only, to the extent of the purchased quota 
for each crop after the crop year in which the buyer of such quota fails 
to share in the risk of producing a crop of tobacco which is subject to 
such quota.
    (4) Determining forfeited amount. If only part of the quota on a 
farm is attributable to a purchased quota, the amount of the farm 
marketing quota which must be forfeited under paragraph (c) of this 
section shall be determined by increasing or decreasing each respective 
purchase of farm marketing quota for the farm to reflect changes in 
national quota factors since the purchase occurred and subtracting the 
pounds of quota which have been sold to prevent forfeiture.
    (d) Hearing. Before any forfeiture of quota becomes effective under 
the provisions of this section, the county FSA committee shall:
    (1) Schedule a hearing for the affected person.
    (2) Notify the affected person of the hearing at least 10 days in 
advance of the hearing.
    (3) Make a determination, on the basis of the evidence presented at 
the hearing by or on behalf of the affected person and by or on behalf 
of the county FSA committee as to whether or not:
    (i) Any of the conditions for forfeiture specified in this section 
exist; and
    (ii) The affected person knowingly failed to take steps to prevent 
forfeiture of allotment and quota when such forfeiture conditions have 
been determined to exist with respect to the provisions of paragraph (b) 
of this section.
    (iii) The affected person knowingly failed to take steps to prevent 
forfeiture of burley tobacco quota.
    (4) Notify the affected persons of the county FSA committee 
determination and, if forfeiture of quota is to be required, afford such 
person an opportunity to appeal to a review committee in accordance with 
the provision of part 711 of this chapter.
    (e) Apportionment of data and determination of quota after 
forfeiture. (1) Apportionment of data. The pounds of farm marketing 
quota retained on the forfeiting farm after the forfeiture shall be 
divided by the farm marketing quota established for the farm before the 
forfeiture to determine a factor for

[[Page 137]]

apportioning farm data. The data to be retained on the forfeiting farm 
shall be determined by multiplying the factor by the following data for 
the forfeiting farm:
    (i) Overmarketings which have been subtracted when determining the 
effective farm marketing quota of the forfeiting farm.
    (ii) Pounds of quota transferred from the forfeiting farm by lease 
or by the owner in the current year.
    (iii) Pounds of quota reduced in the current year for a marketing 
quota violation in a prior year.
    (iv) Previous year's effective farm marketing quota.
    (v) Previous year's marketings.
    (vi) Previous year's farm marketing quota.
    (vii) Pounds of quota transferred to the farm by lease or by owner 
in the previous year.

The portion of the forfeiting farm data which shall be included in a 
forfeiture pool for the county shall be determined by subtracting the 
pounds of each respective item of farm data which are retained on the 
forfeiting farm from the pounds of the respective item of data which 
were established for the forfeiting farm before forfeiture.
    (2) Forfeiture pool. The data for the forfeiture pool shall be added 
to any previous data in the forfeiture pool.
    (3) Quota after forfeiture. After adjustment of data, the effective 
farm marketing quota shall be determined in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 723.206 of this part for the forfeiting farm.
    (f) Forfeiture pool. (1) Establishing forfeiture pool. A forfeiture 
pool shall be established in each county in which a forfeiture of quota 
occurs. The forfeiture pool shall be increased to include data for each 
forfeiture and shall be decreased for each reallocation in order to 
reflect any forfeited or reallocated amounts of:
    (i) Farm marketing quota for the current year.
    (ii) Quota reduced for marketing quota violations.
    (iii) Quota transferred from the forfeiting farm by lease or by the 
owner.
    (iv) Previous year's effective farm marketing quota.
    (v) Previous year's marketings.
    (2) Adjustment of data in forfeiture pool. At the beginning of the 
current year, the data in the forfeiture pool shall be adjusted by the 
factor used in determining quotas for old farms. Quota data in the 
forfeiture pool shall be decreased each time any burley tobacco quota is 
reallocated from the forfeiture pool. Such decrease in the quota data 
will be made in the same proportion as the pounds of quota which are 
reallocated from the pool are to the pounds of quota which were in the 
pool before the reallocation.
    (g) Reallocation of quota from forfeiture pool. (1) Application. In 
order to establish eligibility to receive quota from the forfeiture pool 
in the current year, an application must be made on a form approved by 
the Deputy Administrator. Such application must be filed:
    (i) Who may file. By an active producer.
    (ii) When to file. On or before April 30. The State FSA committee 
may establish an earlier date if notice of such earlier date is given in 
time for interested applicants to file an application by the earlier 
date.
    (iii) Where to file. At the county FSA office which serves the farm 
for which the application is filed.
    (2) Eligibility of applicant. In order for an applicant to be 
eligible for quota from the forfeiture pool, the county FSA committee 
must determine that:
    (i) The application was filed timely.
    (ii) The applicant is an active tobacco producer.
    (iii) During the current year or during the 4 years preceding the 
current year, the applicant has not sold or forfeited quota from any 
farm.
    (3) Time to reallocate. The county FSA committee shall:
    (i) Not reallocate any quota from the forfeiture pool until the time 
has passed for filing an application for forfeited quota for the current 
year.
    (ii) Reallocate any quota from the forfeiture pool only during the 
30-day period beginning on the day after the final day for filing an 
application for quota from the forfeiture pool.
    (4) Reallocation by county FSA committee. Reallocation of any burley 
tobacco quota shall be made by the county FSA committee. In making its 
determination of the amounts of quota to

[[Page 138]]

reallocate, the county FSA committee may consider the size of the 
current quotas on the farms of the eligible applicants, the length of 
time the applicants have been farming tobacco, the type of farming done 
by the applicants (i.e., livestock, grain, or other commodities), 
previous leasing history of the applicants, and such other factors which 
in the judgment of the county FSA committee should be considered. A 
burley tobacco quota may be reallocated to a farm which currently does 
not have a burley tobacco quota. A factor shall not be used to 
reallocate quota between all eligible applicants.
    (5) Basis for reallocation from forfeiture pool. Reallocation from 
the forfeiture pool shall be on the basis of pounds of farm marketing 
quota.
    (6) Amount of quota to be reallocated. The county FSA committee may 
reallocate all or part of the quota in the forfeiture pool. The minimum 
amount of quota which may be reallocated to an eligible applicant is the 
total amount of quota in the pool or 100 pounds, whichever is less. The 
maximum amount is 500 pounds. However, up to 1,500 pounds may be 
allocated with State FSA committee concurrence.
    (7) Data for receiving farm. All data for the forfeiture pool shall 
be apportioned to the receiving farm in the proportion that the 
reallocated farm marketing quota is to the total farm marketing quota in 
the forfeiture pool before the reallocation. The data determined for the 
receiving farm in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph shall 
be added to any previous data for the receiving farm.
    (8) Quota for receiving farm. After any adjustments which are made 
in accordance with the provisions of this section, the effective farm 
marketing quota shall be determined for the receiving farm.
    (h) Forfeiture of reallocated quota. Any burley tobacco quota which 
is reallocated in accordance with the provisions of this section shall 
be forfeited if the applicant to whom the quota is reallocated fails to 
share in the risk of producing a crop of tobacco which is subject to 
such quota during any of the 3 years beginning with the crop year during 
which the quota is reallocated. The amount of farm marketing quota which 
must be forfeited shall be determined in the same manner which is 
specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section with respect to the 
forfeiture of purchased quota. Any forfeiture of quota shall occur on 
December 1 of the year in which the applicant fails to share in the risk 
of production of tobacco which is produced subject to such quota. While 
the failure to utilize a quota shall not subject the quota to 
forfeiture, the 3 year period which is specified in this paragraph shall 
be extended by 1 year for each year in which the quota is not utilized.
    (i) Successor-in-interest. A successor-in-interest shall be subject 
to the provisions of this section in the same manner and to the same 
extent as would be applicable to the person whose interest has been 
assumed by such successor-in-interest.
    (1) New owner of farm. The new owner of a farm on which a portion or 
all of the farm marketing quota for such farm was either purchased and/
or was reallocated from forfeited quota shall become the successor-in-
interest to the previous owner of the farm. However, if a farm is 
acquired by a new owner on or before June 30 of the current crop year 
and such owner would otherwise be required to sell or forfeit the farm 
marketing quota because in the preceding crop year the owner of such 
quota did not share in the risk of producing a crop of tobacco which was 
subject to such purchased or reallocated quota, the new owner may be 
considered the buyer of the quota instead of being considered as a 
successor-in-interest to the previous owner of the farm. However, the 
new owner must furnish to the county FSA committee on or before June 30 
of the current year a certification that such owner intends to become an 
active burley tobacco producer. Any purchased or reallocated quota, 
which is acquired by a new owner who is not considered to be the buyer 
of the quota in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, shall 
be subject to the same terms and conditions with respect to forfeiture 
which would be applicable if the new owner actually had purchased the 
quota at the time the farm was acquired.

[[Page 139]]

    (2) Buyer no longer shares in risk of production. The owner of a 
farm shall become the successor-in-interest to the buyer of burley 
tobacco quota which was transferred to a farm but which was not owned by 
such buyer if the buyer ceases to share in the risk of production of 
burley tobacco produced on the farm.

Sec. 723.220  Forfeiture of flue-cured tobacco acreage allotment and marketing quota.

    (a) Determination of allotment and quota subject to forfeiture. (1) 
For purposes of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the phrase 
``owns a farm'' means ownership of:
    (i) A farm as constituted under part 718 of the chapter if the 
entire farm shares a common ownership; or
    (ii) All of the land within a common ownership if the parent farm 
consists of separate ownership tracts of land.
    (2) For purposes of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the 
county FSA committee shall, in accordance with the provisions of part 
718 of this chapter, apportion the flue-cured tobacco acreage allotment 
and marketing quota assigned to a farm between:
    (i) All land which is owned by any person which is not significantly 
involved in the management or use of land for agricultural purposes, as 
described in paragraph (b) of this section; and
    (ii) Each common ownership tract of land in the farm other than that 
described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.
    (3) With respect to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, 
an acreage allotment and marketing quota shall be determined for a tract 
in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section only to the 
extent that records are available to show the contribution which the 
tract made to the flue-cured tobacco acreage allotment of the parent 
farm.
    (4) The farm acreage allotment and farm marketing quota determined 
under this section for each farm or tract, as applicable, will be the 
amount of allotment and quota subject to forfeiture under this section.
    (b) Persons not significantly involved in management or use of land 
for agricultural purposes. For purposes of this paragraph, the term 
``person'' means a person as defined in part 718 of this chapter, 
including any: Governmental entity, public utility, educational 
institution, or religious institution, but not including any: 
Individual, partnership, joint venture, family farm corporation, trust, 
estate, or similar fiduciary account with respect to which 50 percent or 
more of the beneficial interest is in one or more individuals; or 
educational institution that uses a flue-cured tobacco acreage allotment 
and marketing quota for instruction or demonstrational purposes.
    (1) Required forfeiture. If at any time the county FSA committee 
determines that any person which owns farm for which a flue-cured 
tobacco acreage allotment and marketing quota are established is not 
significantly involved in the management or use of land for agricultural 
purposes, such person shall forfeit such allotment and quota which is 
not sold on or before December 1 of the year for which the county FSA 
committee makes such a determination.
    (2) Owner ceases to be significantly involved. A person shall be 
considered to be significantly involved in the management or use of land 
for agricultural purposes if the county FSA committee determines that:
    (i) For the 3 preceding years, more than 20 percent of the gross 
income of the person has been derived from the management or use of land 
for the production of crops which are planted and harvested annually, 
and/or livestock, including pasture and forage for livestock; and
    (ii) Any other person or all other persons which in combination own 
more than 50 percent of the assets of the owner of the flue-cured 
tobacco allotment and marketing quota also meet the criteria specified 
in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
    (3) Documentation. Within 30 days after a written request is made by 
the county FSA committee, or within such extended time as may be granted 
by the county FSA committee, a person must submit such documentation as

[[Page 140]]

may be requested to support a determination that the provisions of 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section have been met with respect to such 
person. Upon failure of such person to timely respond to such request, 
the county FSA committee shall determine that the person is not 
significantly involved in the management or use of land for agricultural 
purposes.
    (c)-(d) [Reserved]
    (e) Buyers of allotment fail to share in the risk of production.
    (1) Forfeiture required. If any person buys flue-cured acreage 
allotment and quota and such person fails to share in the risk of 
producing the tobacco which was planted subject to such quota during any 
of the three crop years beginning with the crop year for which the 
purchase became effective such person shall forfeit the purchased quota 
if it is not sold on or before December 31 of the year after the crop 
year in which such crop was planted.
    (2) Failure to utilize purchased allotment and quota. Failure to 
utilize purchased allotment and quota for the production of tobacco 
shall not result in the forfeiture of such quota, but the 3 year period 
which is specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be extended 
1 year for each year for which the quota is not utilized.
    (3) Reduction for failure to share in risk of production. The 
effective allotment and quota shall be reduced, but not below zero acres 
or pounds, for planting, leasing, and marketing quota purposes only, to 
the extent of purchased allotment and quota for each crop year after the 
crop year in which the buyer of such allotment and quota fails to share 
in the risk of producing a crop of tobacco planted under such allotment 
and quota.
    (4) Determining forfeited amount. If only part of the allotment and 
quota on a farm resulted from purchased allotment or quota, the amount 
of farm marketing quota which must be forfeited under paragraph (e) of 
this section shall be determined by:
    (i) Increasing or decreasing each respective purchase of farm 
marketing quota for the farm to reflect any annual changes in national 
acreage and national yield factors subsequent to the year of purchase.
    (ii) Adding the amounts determined in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this 
section, multiplying the result by the farm yield for the farm, and 
subtracting the pounds of quota which have been sold to prevent 
forfeiture.
    (f) Tobacco not planted nor considered planted. Notwithstanding any 
other provision of this part, any person who owns a farm for which a 
flue-cured tobacco acreage allotment and marketing quota are 
established, shall forfeit such allotment and quota after February 15 of 
any year immediately following the 1st year of the 3-year period 
immediately preceding the year for which the county FSA committee 
determines that flue-cured tobacco was not planted nor considered 
planted on such farm during at least 2 years of such 3-year period.
    (g) Hearing. Before any forfeiture of allotment and quota becomes 
effective under the provisions of this section, the county FSA committee 
shall:
    (1) Schedule a hearing for the affected person.
    (2) Notify the affected person of the hearing at least 10 days in 
advance of the hearing.
    (3) Make a determination, on the basis of evidence presented at the 
hearing by or on behalf of the affected person and by or on behalf of 
the county FSA committee as to whether:
    (i) Any of the conditions of requiring forfeiture as specified in 
this section exist; and
    (ii) The affected person knowingly failed to take steps to prevent 
forfeiture of a flue-cured tobacco acreage allotment and marketing 
quota.
    (4) Notify the affected person of the county FSA committee 
determination and, if forfeiture of allotment and quota is to be 
required, afford such person an opportunity to appeal to a review 
committee under the provision of part 711 of this chapter.
    (5) Wait until the period has passed for the affected person to 
appeal the county FSA committee or review committee determination that 
allotment and quota must be forfeited under the provisions of this 
section.
    (h) Apportionment of data and determination of allotment and quota 
after forfeiture. (1) Apportionment of data. The

[[Page 141]]

pounds of farm marketing quota retained on the forfeiting farm after the 
forfeiture shall be divided by the farm marketing quota established for 
the forfeiting farm before the forfeiture to determine a factor for 
apportioning farm data for the current year and for the base period. The 
data to be retained on the forfeiting farm shall be determined by 
multiplying the factor by the following data of the forfeiting farm, 
the:
    (i) Planted and considered planted acres for the base period.
    (ii) History acres for the base period.
    (iii) Farm acreage allotment for the base period.
    (iv) Overmarketings which have not been subtracted when determining 
the effective farm marketing quota of the forfeiting farm.
    (v) Acres of allotment reduced in the current year for a marketing 
quota violation in a prior year.
    (vi) Previous year's effective farm marketing quota.
    (vii) Previous year's marketings.
    (viii) Previous year's farm marketing quota.
    (ix) Pounds of quota transferred from the forfeiting farm by lease 
in the current year.
    (x) Pounds of quota transferred to the farm by lease in the previous 
year.

The portion of the forfeiting farm data which shall be included in a 
forfeiture pool for the county shall be determined by subtracting the 
acres or pounds which are retained on the forfeiting farm from the acres 
or pounds established for the forfeiting farm before forfeiture.
    (2) Forfeiture pool. The data for the forfeiture pool shall be added 
to any previous data in the forfeiture pool.
    (3) Allotment and quota after forfeiture. After adjustment of data, 
the effective farm acreage allotment and the effective farm marketing 
quota shall be determined in accordance with Sec. 723.205 and 723.206 of 
this part, respectively, for the forfeiting farm.
    (i) Forfeiture pool. (1) Establishing forfeiture pool. A forfeiture 
pool shall be established in each county in which a forfeiture of 
allotment and quota occurs. The forfeiture pool shall be increased to 
include data for each forfeiture and shall be decreased for each 
reallocation in order to reflect any forfeited or reallocated amounts of 
the:
    (i) Farm acreage allotment for the current year and for the base 
period.
    (ii) Farm marketing quota for the current year and for the base 
period.
    (iii) Acres reduced for violation.
    (iv) Planted and considered planted acres for the base period.
    (v) History acres for the base period.
    (vi) Previous year's effective farm marketing quota.
    (vii) Previous year's marketing.
    (viii) Quota transferred from the forfeiting farm by lease.
    (2) Yield for forfeiture pool. The farm yield for the forfeiture 
pool shall be determined by dividing the farm marketing quota in the 
forfeiture pool by the farm acreage allotment in the forfeiture pool. 
The preliminary farm yield for the forfeiture pool shall be determined 
by dividing the farm yield by the national yield factor.
    (3) Adjustment of data in forfeiture pool. At the beginning of the 
current year, the data in the forfeiture pool shall be adjusted by the 
factors used in determining yields, allotments, and quotas for old 
farms. Acreage and quota data in the forfeiture pool shall be decreased 
each time quota is reallocated from the forfeiture pool, such decrease 
to be made in the same proportion as the pounds of quota which are 
reallocated from the pool are to the pounds of quota which were in the 
pool before the reallocation.
    (j) Reallocation of allotment and quota from forfeiture pool. (1) 
Application. In order to establish eligibility to receive allotment and 
quota from the forfeiture pool in the current year, an application must 
be made on a form approved by the Deputy Administrator. Such application 
must be filed:
    (i) Who may file. By an active producer.
    (ii) When to file. On or before March 31. The State FSA committee 
may establish an earlier date if notice of such earlier date is given in 
time for interested applicants to file an application by the earlier 
date.
    (iii) Where to file. At the county FSA office which serves the farm 
for which the application is filed.

[[Page 142]]

    (2) Eligibility of applicant. In order for an applicant to be 
eligible for allotment and quota from the forfeiture pool, the county 
FSA committee must determine that:
    (i) The application was filed timely.
    (ii) The applicant is an active producer.
    (iii) During the current year or during the 4 years preceding the 
current year, the applicant has not:
    (A) Sold or forfeited allotment and quota from any farm.
    (B) Used the designation method of division to retain less allotment 
than the farm would have retained by another method of division.
    (3) Time to reallocate. The county FSA committee shall:
    (i) Not reallocate any allotment and quota from the forfeiture pool 
until the time has passed for filing an application for forfeited 
allotment and quota for the current year.
    (ii) Reallocate any allotment and quota from the forfeiture pool 
only during the 30-day period beginning on the day after the final day 
for filing an application for allotment and quota from the forfeiture 
pool.
    (4) Reallocation by county FSA committee. Reallocation of any 
allotment and quota shall be made by the county FSA committee. In making 
its determination of the amounts to reallocate, the county FSA committee 
may consider the size of the current allotments on the farms of the 
eligible applicants, the length of time the applicants have been farming 
tobacco, the type of farming done by the applicants (i.e., livestock, 
grain, or other commodities), and other factors which in the judgment of 
the county FSA committee should be considered. Allotment and quota may 
be reallocated to a farm which currently does not have a flue-cured 
tobacco allotment. A factor shall not be used to reallocate allotment 
and quota between all eligible applicants.
    (5) Basis for reallocation from forfeiture pool. Reallocation from 
the forfeiture pool shall be on the basis of pounds of farm marketing 
quota.
    (6) Amount of quota to reallocate. The county FSA committee may 
reallocate all or part of the quota in the forfeiture pool.
    (i) Minimum. The minimum amount of quota which may be reallocated to 
an eligible applicant is the total amount of quota in the pool or 200 
pounds, whichever is less.
    (ii) Maximum. The maximum amount of quota which may be reallocated 
to an eligible applicant is 1,000 pounds. However, with State FSA 
committee approval, up to 2,500 pounds may be allocated.
    (7) Data for receiving farm. All data for the forfeiture pool shall 
be apportioned to the receiving farm in the proportion that the 
reallocated farm marketing quota is to the total farm marketing quota in 
the forfeiture pool before the reallocation. The pounds of farm 
marketing quota reallocated to a farm shall be divided by the farm yield 
for the farm to determine the amount of reallocated farm acreage 
allotment. The data determined for the receiving farm in accordance with 
the provisions of this paragraph shall be added to any previous data for 
the receiving farm.
    (8) Allotment and quota for receiving farm. After any adjustments 
which are made in accordance with the provisions of this section, the 
farm acreage allotment, the effective farm acreage allotment, and the 
effective farm marketing quota shall be determined for the receiving 
farm according to Secs. 723.205 and 723.206, respectively, of this part.
    (k) Forfeiture of reallocated allotment and quota. Allotment and 
quota which is reallocated in accordance with the provisions of this 
section shall be forfeited if the applicant to whom the quota is 
reallocated fails to share in the risk of producing a crop of tobacco 
which is subject to such quota during any of the 3 years beginning with 
the crop year during which the quota is reallocated. The amount of farm 
marketing quota which must be forfeited shall be determined in the same 
manner which is specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section with 
respect to the forfeiture of purchased quota. Any forfeiture of quota 
shall occur on December 1 of the year in which the applicant fails to 
share in the risk of production of tobacco which is produced subject to 
such quota. While the failure to utilize a quota shall not subject the 
quota to forfeiture, the 3 year period which is

[[Page 143]]

specified in this paragraph shall be extended by 1 year for each year in 
which the quota is not utilized.
    (l) Successor-in-interest. The successor-in-interest shall be 
subject to the provisions of this section in the same manner and to the 
same extent as would be applicable to the person whose interest was 
assumed.
    (1) New owner. The new owner of a farm on which a portion or all of 
the farm acreage allotment and farm marketing quota for such farm was 
either purchased and/or was reallocated from forfeited allotment and 
quota shall become the successor-in-interest to the previous owner of 
the farm. However, if a farm is acquired by a new owner on or before 
June 15 of the current crop year and such owner would otherwise be 
required to sell or forfeit the farm acreage allotment and farm 
marketing quota because in the preceding crop year the owner of such 
allotment and quota did not share in the risk of producing a crop of 
tobacco which was subject to such purchased or reallocated allotment and 
quota, the new owner may be considered the buyer of the allotment and 
quota instead of being considered as a successor-in-interest to the 
previous owner of the farm. However, the new owner must furnish to the 
county FSA committee on or before June 15 of the current year a 
certification that such owner intends to become an active flue-cured 
tobacco producer. Any purchased or reallocated allotment and quota, 
which is acquired by a new owner who is considered to be the buyer of 
the allotment and quota in accordance with the provisions of this 
paragraph, shall be subject to the same terms and conditions with 
respect to forfeiture which would be applicable if the new owner 
actually had purchased the allotment and quota at the time the farm was 
acquired.
    (2) Buyer no longer shares in risk of production. The owner of a 
farm shall become the successor-in-interest to the buyer of allotment 
and quota which was transferred to a farm but which was not owned by 
such buyer if the buyer ceases to share in the risk of the production of 
tobacco produced on the farm.

<R05>
Sec. 723.301  Identification of tobacco subject to quota.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, 
any tobacco which is determined by a representative of the State FSA 
committee or county FSA committee to have the same appearance and 
characteristics as a kind of tobacco for which marketing quotas are in 
effect shall be deemed to be a quota kind of tobacco. Such tobacco shall 
continue to be deemed a quota kind of tobacco unless it has been 
certified by the Agricultural Marketing Service, U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, under the Tobacco Inspection Act (7 U.S.C. 511) and 
implementing regulations (7 CFR part 30), prior to removal of the 
tobacco from the State where it was produced, as a kind of tobacco not 
subject to marketing quotas.
    (b) Any kind of tobacco for which marketing quotas are not in effect 
that is produced in a State where marketing quotas are in effect for any 
kind of tobacco shall be subject to the quota for the kind of tobacco 
for which marketing quotas are in effect in that State. If marketing 
quotas are in effect in a State for more than one kind of tobacco, 
nonquota tobacco produced in the State shall be subject to the quota for 
the kind of quota tobacco produced in the State having the highest price 
support under the Agricultural Act of 1949.
    (c) Paragraph (b) of this section shall not apply to:
    (1) Maryland (type 32) tobacco when it is nonquota tobacco and 
produced on a farm for which a marketing quota for Maryland (type 32) 
tobacco was established when marketing quotas for such kind of tobacco 
were last in effect (1965);
    (2) Cigar-filler (type 41) tobacco when it is nonquota tobacco and 
produced in Pennsylvania;
    (3) Cigar-wrapper (types 61 and 62) tobacco when it is nonquota 
tobacco and produced in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Georgia or Florida;

[[Page 144]]

    (4) Tobacco produced in a quota State that is represented to be 
nonquota tobacco and that is readily and distinguishably different from 
all kinds of quota tobacco, as determined by the Agricultural Marketing 
Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, through application of the 
standards issued by the Secretary for the inspection and identification 
of tobacco. Such inspection and identification shall be made prior to 
removal of the tobacco from the State where it was produced; and
    (5) Tobacco which is nonquota tobacco and produced in a quota area 
in which the total of the acreage allotments for quota tobacco 
established for farms is less than twenty acres.


<R05>
Sec. 723.302  Tobacco for experimental purposes.

    For farms on which tobacco is being grown for experimental purposes 
by or under the direction of a publicly owned agricultural experiment 
station, such tobacco shall be exempt from any penalties otherwise 
required by this part if, before the beginning of the harvesting of 
tobacco from any farm on which experimental tobacco is being grown, the 
director of such publicly owned agricultural experimental station 
furnishes a report, to the State Executive Director for the State in 
which the farm is located, that includes the following information:
    (a) Name and address of the publicly owned agricultural experiment 
station.
    (b) Name of the owner, and name of the operator if different from 
the owner, and the farm number of each farm on which tobacco is grown

farm for experimental purposes only.
    (d) A certification signed by the director of the publicly owned 
agricultural experiment station to the effect that such acreage or 
poundage of tobacco is being grown for each farm for experimental 
purposes only, the tobacco is being grown under the auspices of such 
director, and the acreage of each plot was considered necessary for 
carrying out the experiment.


<R05>
Sec. 723.303  Production of registered or certified flue-cured tobacco seed.

    Producers of registered or certified flue-cured tobacco seed may 
devote flue-cured tobacco acreage in excess of the effective allotment 
to seed production without such acreage of tobacco causing a ``No Price 
Support'' entry on the marketing card issued for the farm if an 
agreement is signed by the farm operator, and the producer, if different 
from the operator, which provides:
    (a) Destruction prior to harvest. For the destruction prior to 
harvest of all tobacco produced on the acreage designated for seed 
production.
    (b) Producer payment of compliance costs. That the producers shall 
pay the cost of compliance visits to a farm by representatives of the 
county FSA committee for the purposes of:
    (1) Designating and determining the acreage of seed production, and
    (2) Determining that no tobacco has been harvested from the acreage 
designated for seed production and to witness destruction of tobacco 
leaves.
    (c) Agreement. That the producer(s) signing the agreement shall 
agree to timely notify the county FSA office when the tobacco seed has 
been harvested.
    (d) No history credit. That the planting of the tobacco acreage for 
seed production will not create history acreage for the purpose of 
establishing future farm allotments.
    (e) Cancellation of marketing cards. That if the county FSA 
committee determines that any of the terms and conditions of the 
agreement have been violated or any material misrepresentation has been 
made, any marketing card issued for the farm in recognition of the 
agreement shall be recalled and canceled, and a marketing card shall be 
issued to reflect that tobacco produced on the farm is not eligible for 
price support.


<R05>
Sec. 723.304  Determination of discount varieties.

    (a) Definition. Discount variety means any of the flue-cured tobacco 
seed varieties designated as Coker 139, Coker 140, Coker 316, Reams 64, 
Reams 266, or Dixie Bright 244, or a mixture or strain of such seed 
varieties, or any breeding

[[Page 145]]

line of flue-cured tobacco seed varieties, including, but not limited 
to, 187-Golden Wilt (also designated by such names as No-Name, XYZ, 
Mortgage Lifter, Super XyZ), having the quality and chemical 
characteristics of the seed varieties designated as Coker 139, Coker 
140, Coker 316, Reams 64, Reams 266, or Dixie Bright 244. However, where 
there is growing in a field offtype plants of not more than 2 percent, 
such offtype plants shall not be considered in certifying the flue-cured 
tobacco variety being produced. Flue-cured tobacco variety which is not 
certified to be discount variety shall be considered as ``acceptable 
variety.''
    (b) Producer report. The operator, or any producer, on each farm 
producing flue-cured tobacco shall file with the county FSA office a 
report on MQ-32 showing whether or not discount variety tobacco was 
planted on the farm.
    (c) Failure to file report. If the operator of a farm on which flue-
cured tobacco is being produced in the current year fails or refuses, 
within 7 days after a request of the county FSA committee on MQ-34-1, 
Notice of Action Required Regarding Determination of Seed Varieties of 
Flue-Cured Tobacco, to file a report on MQ-32, showing whether or not 
there was planted any of the discount varieties of flue-cured tobacco on 
such farm, all flue-cured tobacco produced on such farm shall be 
considered by the county FSA committee to be discount variety tobacco 
unless the county FSA committee finds that failure to comply with the 
request was due to circumstances beyond the control of the farm 
operator.
    (d) Notice to farm operator. The farm operator having discount 
variety tobacco shall be given written notice by certified mail on MQ-
34-2, Notice of Determination of Discount Variety of Flue-Cured Tobacco. 
This notice to the farm operator shall constitute notice to all persons 
who, as owner, operator, landlord, tenant, or sharecropper, are 
interested in the tobacco grown on the farm.
    (e) Producer's right to recertify. Any producer on a farm who 
received a Form MQ-34-2 notifying such producer that the farm has 
discount variety tobacco when in fact an acceptable variety is being 
produced may recertify on Form MQ-32.
    (f) Issuance of marketing cards. (1) If a farm is considered to have 
discount variety tobacco available for marketing and the farm is 
eligible for price support, the county FSA executive director shall 
issue MQ-76, bearing the notation ``Discount Variety-Limited Price 
Support.'' If the farm is considered to have discount variety tobacco 
but it is not eligible for price support, the county FSA executive 
director shall issue MQ-76, bearing the notation ``Discount Variety-No 
Price Support.''
    (2)(i) Where an MQ-76, bearing the notation, ``Discount Variety-
Limited Price Support'' is issued for a farm, the card may be exchanged 
at the county FSA office for an MQ-76, without the notation, or
    (ii) Where an MQ-76, bearing the notation ``Discount Variety-No 
Price Support'' is issued for a farm the card may be exchanged at the 
county FSA office for MQ-76 with the notation ``No Price Support.'' 
However, the farm operator shall establish to the satisfaction of the 
county FSA committee that there has been no commingling or substitution 
of discount variety tobacco produced on the farm or on any other farm 
operated by such operator, and that all discount variety tobacco has 
been marketed or satisfactorily disposed of, or accounted for.
    (3) MQ-76 issued to identify marketings of tobacco grown for 
experimental purposes by or for publicly owned experiment stations shall 
bear the notation ``Discount Variety-Limited Price Support'' if such 
tobacco is discount variety tobacco.
    (g) Identification of flue-cured leaf account tobacco as acceptable 
variety--(1) Whenever the Director determines there is a significant 
amount of discount variety tobacco available for marketing in any 
marketing year, the Director may cause to be initiated the provisions of 
this paragraph. In addition, the Director may terminate any action 
initiated hereunder when it is determined that no discount variety of 
flue-cured tobacco remains available for sale during the remainder of 
the current marketing season. Notification

[[Page 146]]

to warehouse operators of action required under this paragraph shall be 
by the State FSA executive director.
    (2)(i) Each warehouse operator who offers for auction sale any leaf

identify such operator's tobacco as being an ``acceptable variety,'' 
shall execute MQ-79-1 (Flue-Cured), Dealer's Certification-Resale 
Tobacco.
    (ii) Each executed MQ-79-1 (Flue-Cured) shall show the following 
information with respect to resale tobacco:
    (A) Crop year.
    (B) Name and address of warehouse where the tobacco is being offered 
for sale.
    (C) Date, signature of dealer and current address and dealer 
identification number.
    (D) Tobacco sale bill number and date.
    (iii) Each dealer or any person who acquires acceptable variety 
tobacco in a manner which would make it eligible for certification on 
MQ-79-1, or who has on hand both discount variety tobacco and acceptable 
variety tobacco, and desires to dispose of acceptable variety tobacco 
prior to disposing of the discount variety tobacco, may apply in writing 
to the State FSA executive director for a special authorization to have 
the acceptable variety tobacco certified when offered for auction sale.
    (h) Estimate of production. For any farm on which discount variety 
tobacco is being grown, a Form MQ-92, Estimate of Production, shall be 
obtained.


<R05>
Sec. 723.305  Issuance of marketing cards.

    (a) General. Each marketing of tobacco from a farm in a quota area 
shall be identified by a valid marketing card unless prior to marketing 
an AMS certification is issued for such tobacco to indicate that such 
tobacco is a nonquota kind of tobacco.
    (1) A marketing card (MQ-76 or MQ-77) shall be issued for the 
current marketing year for each farm having quota tobacco available for 
marketing. Cards shall be issued in the name of the farm operator except 
that:
    (i) Cards issued for tobacco grown for experimental purposes only 
shall be issued in the name of the experiment station,
    (ii) Cards issued to a successor-in-interest shall be issued in the 
name of the successor-in-interest,
    (iii) For kinds of tobacco other than flue-cured and burley, if a 
part of a farm which includes the tobacco acreage on the farm is cash 
leased to such producer, cards shall be issued in the name of such 
producer. The face of the marketing card may show the name of other 
interested producers. A marketing card may be issued in the name of a 
producer who is not the farm operator if the county FSA committee 
determines pursuant to the procedure in paragraph (a)(2) of this section 
that such producer has been or likely will be deprived of the right to 
use the marketing card issued for the farm to market such producer's 
proportionate share of the crop.

[[Page 147]]

    (2) If the county FSA committee has reason to believe that one or 
more producers on the farm have been or likely will be deprived of the 
right to use such marketing card to market such producer's proportionate 
share of the crop, a hearing shall be scheduled by the county FSA 
committee and the operator of the farm and the producer or producers 
involved shall be invited to be present, or to be represented, at which 
time they shall be given the opportunity to substantiate their claims 
concerning the use of the farm marketing card to market each such 
producer's proportionate share of the effective farm marketing quota for 
such crop. At least two members of the county FSA committee shall be 
present at the hearing. The hearing shall be held at the time and place 
named in the notice. A summary of the evidence presented at the hearing 
shall be prepared for use of the county FSA committee. If the farm 
operator or other producer(s) on the farm do not attend the hearing, or 
are not represented, the county FSA committee shall make its decision on 
the basis of information available to such committee. If the county FSA 
committee finds that any producer on the farm has been or likely will be 
deprived of the right to use the marketing card issued for the farm to 
market such producer's proportionate share of the crop, a separate 
marketing card shall be issued to such producer. With respect to burley 
and flue-cured tobacco, the marketing card issued for the farm shall be 
recalled and a separate marketing card, showing 103 percent of the 
producer's proportionate share of the effective farm marketing quota 
shall be issued to each such producer who it is determined has been or 
likely will be deprived of the opportunity to market such producer's 
proportionate share of the crop and another card (or other cards if 
considered preferable by the county FSA committee) shall be issued 
showing 103 percent of the effective farm marketing quota to enable the 
other producers on the farm to market their proportionate shares. The 
marketing cards issued pursuant to this subparagraph shall reflect the 
proportionate pounds, if any, already marketed by each producer.
    (3) The procedure in paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall not 
apply to a person who was a producer on the farm in a prior year but who 
is not a producer in the current crop year.
    (b) Person authorized to issue marketing cards. The county FSA 
executive director shall be responsible for the issuance of marketing 
cards. For kinds of tobacco other than burley and flue-cured tobacco, 
each marketing card shall bear the actual or facsimile signature of the 
county FSA executive director who issued the card.
    (c) Rights of producers and successors-in-interest. (1) Each 
producer having a share in tobacco available for marketing from a farm 
shall be entitled to the use of the marketing card for marketing such 
producer's proportionate share.
    (2) Any person who succeeds, other than a dealer, in whole or in 
part to the share of a producer in the tobacco available for marketing 
from a farm, shall, to the extent of such succession, have the same 
right to the use of the marketing card and bear the same liability for 
penalties as the original producer.
    (d) No price support-burley and flue-cured tobacco. For burley and 
flue-cured tobacco, the notation ``No Price Support'' shall be entered 
on each marketing card issued for the use of:
    (1) Farm. The farm if any producer on the farm is ineligible for 
price support under the provisions of part 1464 of this title.
    (2) Producer. The producer on a farm if the producer is ineligible 
for price support under the provisions of part 1464 of this title.
    (e) Farm quota data entered on marketing card and supplemental card 
for burley or flue-cured tobacco:
    (1) Any marketing card issued to market burley or flue-cured tobacco 
shall show when issued, in the space provided on the reverse side, the 
pounds computed by multiplying 103 percent times the effective farm 
marketing quota.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this section, if the tobacco 
available for marketing from the farm is determined by the county FSA 
committee or the county FSA executive director

[[Page 148]]

to be less than the effective farm marketing quota, for purposes of 
issuing a marketing card and showing thereon the farm's 103 percent of 
the effective quota, the effective farm marketing quota for the farm 
shall be considered to be the pounds determined to be available for 
marketing from the farm. If any producer on the farm satisfies the 
county FSA committee or county FSA executive director that the quantity 
of tobacco produced on the farm in the current year, plus any carryover 
tobacco from a prior year, is greater than the previously determined 
pounds of tobacco available for marketing from the farm, the pounds 
shown on the marketing card shall be increased accordingly, but not to 
exceed an amount which would cause the total pounds shown on the 
marketing card to equal 103 percent of the effective farm marketing 
quota.
    (3) Upon request by the farm operator, a supplemental marketing card 
bearing the same name and identification as shown on the original 
marketing card may be issued for a farm upon return to the county FSA 
office of an original marketing card or a supplemental marketing card. 
The pounds computed as the balance of 103 percent of quota from a prior 
marketing card shall be shown in the first space on the reverse side of 
the marketing card.
    (4) Upon written request of the farm operator two or more marketing 
cards may be issued for a farm if the farm operator specifies the number 
of pounds of quota to be assigned to each marketing card. In such case, 
the total pounds of quota specified in the entry, ``103 percent of 
quota,'' on all marketing cards issued for the farm may not exceed 103 
percent of the effective farm marketing quota.
    (f) Farm quota data entered on marketing card and supplemental card 
for any kind of tobacco other than burley or flue-cured: (1) Within 
quota marketing card. A within quota marketing card, MQ-76, indicating 
the tobacco is eligible for price support shall be issued for use in 
identifying the kind of tobacco that is available for marketing from a 
farm when such tobacco:
    (i) Is eligible for price support according to the provisions of 
part 1464 of this title.
    (ii) Was grown for experimental purposes by a publicly owned 
agricultural experiment station.
    (2) Excess marketing card. An excess marketing card (MQ-77) shall be 
issued for a farm for marketing a kind of tobacco that is ineligible for 
price support. Before the MQ-77 is issued the county FSA executive 
director shall enter on such marketing card the rate of any penalty that 
is to be deducted from the proceeds from any marketing of tobacco 
identified by such marketing card. An MQ-77 shall be issued for each 
farm for each kind of tobacco for which:
    (i) There is excess tobacco available for marketing from the farm; 
or
    (ii) The producer is not an eligible producer or the tobacco is not 
eligible tobacco as determined in accordance with part 1464 of this 
title.
    (3) Full penalty rate. The full penalty rate shall be entered on 
each MQ-77 issued to identify tobacco produced on a farm for which:
    (i) An acreage allotment was not established;
    (ii) The farm operator or another producer on the farm prevents the 
county FSA committee from obtaining information necessary to determine 
the correct acreage of tobacco on the farm;
    (iii) The farm operator fails in accordance with part 718 of this 
chapter to provide a certification of acreage planted to tobacco, or
    (iv) The farm operator or another producer on the farm has not 
agreed to make contributions to the No Net Cost Fund or pay assessments 
to the No Net Cost Account, as applicable, in accordance with part 1464 
of this title.
    (4) Converted penalty rate. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(3) 
of this section, a converted penalty rate shall be entered on each MQ-77 
issued to identify tobacco produced on a farm from which there is excess 
tobacco available for marketing and the percentage of excess is less 
than 100 percent. For the purpose of determining the penalty due on each 
marketing by a producer of tobacco subject to penalty, the converted 
rate of penalty per pound shall be determined by multiplying the 
applicable rate of penalty for the current crop by

[[Page 149]]

the percent excess determined according to this paragraph. For a farm 
without carryover tobacco from a prior year, the percent excess shall be 
determined by dividing the excess acreage of tobacco by the harvested 
acreage of tobacco for the farm. For a farm having carryover tobacco 
from a prior year, the percent excess shall be determined as follows:
    (i) Determine the number of ``carryover'' acres by dividing the 
number of pounds of carryover tobacco from the prior year by the normal 
yield for the farm for that year. Reduce such ``carryover'' acres by the 
amount determined by subtracting the harvested acreage from the 
allotment in the current year. If the ``carryover'' acres are entirely 
offset by the underharvested acreage, the percent excess will be zero 
and a MQ-76 may be issued if the farm otherwise is eligible for price 
support and the remainder of this paragraph (f)(4) of this section are 
inapplicable.
    (ii) Determine the number of ``within quota carryover acres'' by 
multiplying the ``carryover acres'' by the ``percent within quota'' 
(i.e., 100 percent minus the percent excess) for the year in which the 
carryover tobacco was produced.
    (iii) Determine the ``total acres'' of tobacco by adding the 
``carryover acres'' and the acreage of tobacco harvested in the current 
year.
    (iv) Determine the ``excess acres'' by subtracting from the ``total 
acres'' the sum of the current year's allotment and the ``within quota 
carryover acres.''
    (v) Determine the percent excess by dividing the ``excess acres'' by 
the ``total acres.''
    (5) Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(3) and (4) of this section, 
a zero penalty rate shall be entered on any MQ-77 issued in accordance 
with this section.
    (g) Other marketing card data. Other data specified in instructions 
issued by the Deputy Administrator shall be entered on the marketing 
card.


<R05>
Sec. 723.306  Claim stamping and replacing marketing cards.

    (a) Claim stamping. If a person is indebted to the United States and 
such indebtedness has been recorded on the county debt record, any 
marketing card issued for the farm on which the person has a producer 
interest shall bear the notation ``U.S. Claim'' followed by the amount 
of the indebtedness. The name of the debtor-producer, if different from 
the farm operator, shall be recorded directly under the claim notation. 
The notation ``TMQ'' indicating tobacco marketing quota as the type of 
indebtedness shall constitute notice to any buyer that until the amount 
of penalty is paid, the United States has a lien with respect to any 
crop of tobacco in which the debtor-producer has an interest. A claim 
notation other than ``TMQ'' shall constitute notice to any buyer that 
subject to prior liens, the net proceeds from any tobacco pledged as 
collateral for a price support loan shall be paid to the ``Farm Service 
Agency, USDA'' to the extent of the indebtedness shown. The acceptance 
and use of a marketing card bearing a notation and information 
concerning an indebtedness to the United States shall not constitute a 
waiver by the debtor-producer of any right to contest the validity of 
such indebtedness by appropriate appeal. As claim collections are made, 
the amount of the claim shown on the card shall be revised to show the 
claim balance. If requested by the producer, the county FSA executive 
director who issued the marketing card shall issue a claim-free 
marketing card when the claim has been paid.
    (b) Replacing, exchanging, or issuing additional marketing cards. 
Subject to the approval of the county FSA executive director, two or 
more marketing cards may be issued for any farm. Upon the return to the 
county FSA office of a marketing card which had been used in its 
entirety and before the marketing of tobacco from the farm has been 
completed, a new marketing card bearing the same name, information, and 
identification as the used card shall be issued for the farm. A new 
marketing card shall be issued to replace a card which has been 
determined by the county FSA executive director who issued the card to 
have been lost, destroyed, or stolen.

[[Page 150]]


<R05>
Sec. 723.307  Invalid cards.

    (a) Reasons for being invalid. A marketing card shall be invalid if:
    (1) It is not issued or delivered in the manner prescribed;
    (2) An entry is omitted or is incorrect;
    (3) It is lost, destroyed, stolen, or becomes illegible; or,
    (4) Any erasure or alteration has been made and not properly 
initialed by the county FSA executive director.
    (b) Validating invalid cards. If any entry is not made on a 
marketing card as required, either through omission or incorrect entry, 
and the proper entry is made and initialed by the county FSA executive 
director who issued the card, or by a marketing recorder, then such card 
shall become valid.
    (c) Returning invalid cards. In the event any marketing card becomes 
invalid (other than by loss, destruction or theft, or by omission, 
alteration, or incorrect entry, which has not been corrected by the 
county FSA executive director who issued the card, or by a marketing 
recorder), the farm operator, or the person in possession of the card, 
shall return it to the county FSA office at which it was issued.


<R05>
Sec. 723.308  Rate of penalty.

    The rate of penalty for a marketing year shall be equal to seventy-
five (75) percent of the average market price for the kind of tobacco 
for the immediately preceding marketing year as determined and announced 
annually by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

[55 FR 39914, Oct. 1, 1990, as amended at 63 FR 11582, Mar. 10, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 723.309  Persons to pay penalty.

    Subject to any additional requirements or provisions for remittances 
which are contained in Sec. 723.409 of this part, the persons to pay the 
penalty due on any marketing of tobacco subject to penalty shall be 
determined as follows:
    (a) Auction sale. The penalty due on marketings by a producer or 
dealer through an auction sale shall be paid by the warehouse operator 
who may deduct an amount equivalent to the penalty from the price paid 
to the producer or dealer.
    (b) Nonauction sale. The penalty due on tobacco acquired directly 
from a producer or dealer, other than at an auction sale, shall be paid 
by the person acquiring the tobacco who may deduct an amount equivalent 
to the penalty from the price paid to the producer or dealer in the case 
of a sale.
    (c) Marketing outside the United States. The penalty due on 
marketings by a producer or dealer directly to any person outside the 
United States shall be paid by the producer or dealer making the sale.

[55 FR 39914, Oct. 1, 1990, as amended at 63 FR 11582, Mar. 10, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 723.310  Date penalty is due.

    (a) Payment of penalty. Penalties shall become due at the time the 
tobacco is marketed, except that in the case of false identification or 
failure to account for disposition, the penalty shall be due on the date 
of such false identification or failure to account for disposition. The 
penalty shall be paid by remitting the amount due to the State FSA 
office not later than the end of the calendar week in which the tobacco 
becomes subject to penalty. A draft, money order, or check drawn payable 
to the Farm Service Agency may be used to pay any penalty, but any such 
draft or check shall be received subject to payment at par.
    (b) Auction sale net proceeds. If the penalty due on any auction 
sale of tobacco by a producer is in excess of the net proceeds of such 
sale (gross amount for all lots included in the sale less usual 
warehouse charges), the amount of the net proceeds accompanied by a copy 
of the tobacco sale bill covering such sale may be remitted as the full 
penalty due. Usual warehouse charges shall not include the following:
    (1) Advances to producers,
    (2) Charges for hauling, or
    (3) Any other charges not usually incurred by producers in marketing 
tobacco through a warehouse.
    (c) Nonauction sales. Nonauction sales of excess tobacco shall be 
subject to the full rate of penalty and shall be paid in full even 
though the penalty may exceed the proceeds for the sale of tobacco.

[[Page 151]]


<R05>
Sec. 723.311  Lien for penalty; liability of persons who are affiliated with indebted person or who permit the indebted person to use their identification card.

    (a) Lien on tobacco. Until the amount of any marketing quota penalty 
imposed under this part is paid, a lien shall exist in favor of the 
United States for the amount of the penalty on:
    (1) The tobacco with respect to which such penalty is incurred; and
    (2) Any other tobacco subject to marketing quotas in which the 
person liable for payment of the penalty has an interest and which is 
marketed in the same or a subsequent marketing year.
    (b) Lien precedence. The lien, described in paragraph (a) of this 
section, attaches at the time that the penalty is assessed. As to third 
parties, in the event of a lack of actual notice of the lien, then 
notice shall be deemed to occur when:
    (1) In the case of indebted producers, the debt is entered on the 
debt record maintained by the county FSA office of the county in which 
the tobacco was grown;
    (2) In the case of an indebted warehouse operator, the debt is 
entered on the debt record of the State FSA office for the State in 
which the warehouse is located; and
    (3) In the case of an indebted dealer, the debt is entered on the 
debt record of the State FSA office for the State in which the dealer is 
required to file reports.
    (c) Availability of list of marketing quota penalty debts. Each 
county and State FSA office shall maintain a list of tobacco marketing 
penalty debts which have been entered on the debt record in their 
office. The list shall be available for examination upon request by any 
interested person.
    (d) Liability for penalty owed by another person. (1) When a penalty 
in excess of $10,000 is incurred under this part by an entity, all 
persons who have a substantial ownership interest in the entity shall be 
jointly and severally liable with the entity for the payment of such 
penalty, unless it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Deputy 
Administrator that the violation was inadvertent. Substantial ownership 
interest shall be deemed to be any ownership interest greater than ten 
percent.
    (2) A dealer or warehouse operator who permits an indebted person to 
use such dealer's or warehouse operator's identification card to market 
tobacco shall be liable for the amounts due by the indebted person to 
the United States under this part up to the amount of the value of the 
tobacco so marketed. In addition, unless the Deputy Administrator 
determines otherwise, any persons or person, who as a warehouse operator 
or dealer becomes affiliated with any person who at the time of 
affiliation is indebted under this part to the United States, shall be 
liable for the amount of the debt owed to the United States by the 
person with whom such person or persons become affiliated up to the 
amount of the value of any tobacco which is marketed by such affiliated 
warehouse operator or dealer during the time of the affiliation with the 
indebted person. Affiliation may include any relationship in which the 
parties have a common interest in tobacco, or in an enterprise or entity 
involved in the marketing, processing, or handling of tobacco, or where 
the parties both hold a position of responsibility or ownership in such 
an enterprise or entity, or where there is common ownership of a 
business involved in the transaction. A warehouse operator or dealer may 
also be considered to be affiliated with an indebted person when such 
warehouse operator or dealer is associated with a person who is both:
    (i) An employee or otherwise authorized to buy and sell tobacco for 
such warehouse operator or dealer; and
    (ii) An indebted person or at the time of indebtedness incurred by 
an entity was a substantial owner or an officer of the indebted entity.

Affiliation may also be deemed to occur where parties have traded in 
tobacco under circumstances which indicate that there may be a lack of 
arm's length trading between the parties such as where the parties 
engage in casual or undocumented transactions in significant quantities 
of tobacco, or where the parties have traded in tobacco with each other 
without a movement of the tobacco, or where there is

[[Page 152]]

a trading in tobacco without documentation of a significant exchange of 
money, or other circumstances which indicate an affiliation. Where 
questions of affiliation arise, it shall be the burden on the parties 
involved to show that trading in such tobacco was conducted in 
accordance with normal trade practices and was not part of a scheme or 
device to avoid payments of sums due the United States or the CCC.
    (e) TMQ lien notation. Upon notification that a TMQ lien has been 
established, the producer marketing card (MQ-76) or dealer 
identification card (MQ-79-2) shall be returned immediately to the 
issuing office for recording the TMQ lien. Failure to immediately return 
the applicable card will result in FSA notifying all registered 
warehouse operators and dealers of the TMQ lien information and of their 
responsibilities for collecting the TMQ lien. The card shall be promptly 
returned to the producer or dealer after it is annotated with the TMQ 
lien.

[57 FR 43581, Sept. 21, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 723.312  Request for refund of penalty.

    Any person who paid any penalty may request the return of the amount 
of any such payment which is in excess of the amount required to be 
paid. Such request shall be filed on Form MQ-85, Farm Record and 
Account, with the county FSA office within 2 years after the payment of 
the penalty. Approval of return shall be by the county FSA committee, 
subject to the approval of the State FSA executive director.


<R05>
Sec. 723.313  Identification of marketings.

    (a) Burley or flue-cured tobacco. With respect to:
    (1) Identification of producer marketings. Each auction and 
nonauction marketing of burley or flue-cured tobacco shall be identified 
by a valid marketing card, Form MQ-76, issued for the farm. The reverse 
side of the marketing card shall show in pounds:
    (i) 103 percent of quota,
    (ii) Balance of 103 percent of quota after each sale, and
    (iii) Date of each sale.
    (2) Cross-references of tobacco sale bill number to prior sale bill. 
Each warehouse operator, for each lot of tobacco weighed in on the 
warehouse floor for sale the same day, shall cross-reference the tobacco 
sale bill to each prior tobacco sale bill for tobacco identified by the 
same marketing card. To accomplish the cross-reference, each other 
tobacco sale bill number shall be entered by the warehouse operator in 
the ``Remarks'' space on the tobacco sale bill, on all copies, at the 
time such tobacco is weighed at the warehouse.
    (3) Recording producer sale. Each producer sale at auction shall be 
recorded on Form MQ-72-1, Report of Tobacco Auction Sale, and each 
producer sale at nonauction shall be recorded on a Form MQ-72-2, Report 
of Tobacco Nonauction Purchase. For producer sales at nonauction, the 
dealer purchaser shall execute Form MQ-72-2 and shall enter the data on 
Form MQ-76. For producer sales at auction, Form 72-1 and Form MQ-76 
shall be executed only by the FSA marketing recorder.
    (4) Identification of dealer marketings of resale tobacco. Each 
auction and nonauction marketing of resale tobacco in the current year, 
such tobacco shall be identified by a dealer identification card, Form 
MQ-79-2, issued to the dealer for use in the current marketing year.
    (b) Dark air-cured, fire-cured, or Virginia sun-cured tobacco. With 
respect to dark air-cured, fire-cured, or Virginia sun-cured tobacco:
    (1) Identification of producer marketings. Each marketing of such 
kind of tobacco from a farm shall be identified by a valid marketing 
card issued for the farm for the respective kind of a tobacco, either an 
MQ-76 or MQ-77 (including sale memo). With respect to each nonauction 
sale from:
    (i) A within quota farm a check mark shall be entered on the inside 
of MQ-76, and
    (ii) An excess farm for which an MQ-77 is issued, an executed bill 
of nonauction sale shall be prepared, and such bill of nonauction sale 
shall be delivered to a marketing recorder or other person who is 
authorized to issue sale memos.
    (2) Suspended sale and sales without marketing cards. Any suspended 
sale, which is not identified by an MQ-76 or MQ-77 (including a sale 
memo) on or

[[Page 153]]

before the last warehouse sale day of the marketing season, or within 4 
weeks after the date of marketing, whichever comes first, shall be 
identified by MQ-82, Sale Without Marketing Card, as a marketing of 
excess tobacco. Form MQ-82 shall be executed only by a marketing 
recorder or other representative of the State FSA executive director.
    (3) Other persons authorized to execute MQ-76 or MQ-77 (including 
sale memo). (i) A warehouse operator who has been authorized during the 
current marketing year on MQ-78, Tobacco Warehouse Organization, may 
record a sale on MQ-76 or MQ-77 (including the issuance of a sale memo) 
to identify a sale for a farm if a marketing recorder is not available 
at the warehouse when the marketing card is presented.
    (ii) Any warehouse operator, or dealer, who engages in the business 
of acquiring scrap tobacco from farmers, and who has been authorized on 
MQ-78, may for each purchase of scrap tobacco execute an MQ-76, or MQ-77 
(including a sale memo if the bill of nonauction sale has been 
executed).
    (4) Verification of sales processed during the absence of marketing 
recorder. Any person authorized on MQ-78 to act as a marketing recorder 
shall promptly present to a marketing recorder for verification each 
warehouse bill (floor sheet) processed and identified by an MQ-76 or MQ-
77 (including any sale memos) executed in the absence of a marketing 
recorder.
    (5) Withdrawal of approval to act as marketing recorder. The 
authorization on MQ-78 for persons may be withdrawn by the State FSA 
executive director if such action is determined to be necessary to 
properly enforce the regulations in this part.
    (c) Separate display on auction warehouse floor. Any warehouse 
operator upon whose floor more than one kind of tobacco is offered for 
sale at public auction shall for each respective kind of tobacco:
    (1) Display it in separate areas on the auction warehouse floor.
    (2) Use a lot ticket that is distinguishably different from the lot 
ticket used to identify any other kind of tobacco.
    (3) Identify each lot by a lot ticket clearly showing the kind of 
tobacco. However, if where the tobacco is represented to be a nonquota 
kind the lot ticket shall have imprinted thereon the type designation 
for the kind of quota tobacco normally marketed in the area.
    (4) Make and keep records that will ensure a separate accounting and 
reporting of each of such kinds of tobacco (quota and nonquota) sold at 
auction over the warehouse floor.
    (d) Identification of returned first sale (producer) tobacco. When 
resold at auction, tobacco which has been previously sold and returned 
to the warehouse by the buyer is resale tobacco. When such tobacco is 
resold by the warehouse operator, it shall be identified as leaf account 
resale tobacco.
    (e) Verification of penalties by warehouse operators or dealers. 
Each sale of tobacco by a producer which is subject to penalty and which 
has been recorded by a marketing recorder shall be verified by a 
warehouse operator or dealer to determine whether the amount of penalty 
shown to be due has been correctly computed. Such warehouse operator 
shall not be relieved of any liability for the amount of penalty due 
because of any error which may occur in computing the penalty and 
recording the sale.
    (f) Check register. The serial number of the tobacco sale bill(s) 
shall be recorded by the warehouse operator on the check register or 
check stub for the check written covering the auction sale of tobacco by 
a producer.
    (g) Marketing card and sale memo for cigar tobacco. With respect to 
cigar tobacco:
    (1) If a sale of producer's cigar tobacco to a buyer is not 
identified with a marketing card (MQ-76 or MQ-77) issued for the farm, 
including a sale memo from MQ-77, by the end of the sale day and 
recorded and reported on MQ-79 (CF&B), Buyers Record, by the tenth day 
of the calendar month next following the month during which the sale 
occurred, the marketing shall be identified on MQ-79 (CF&B) as a 
marketing of excess tobacco and reported not later than the tenth day of 
the calendar month next following the month during which the sale date 
occurred,

[[Page 154]]

the marketing shall be identified on MQ-79 (CF&B) as a marketing of 
excess tobacco, and reported not later than the tenth day of the 
calendar month next following the month during which the sale day 
occurred.
    (2) Verification of penalty by buyer. Each excess sale memo issued 
by a buyer shall be verified by the buyer to determine whether the 
amount of penalty shown to be due has been correctly computed and such 
buyer shall not be relieved of any liability with respect to the amount

                           and Other Penalties


<R05>
Sec. 723.401  Registration of burley and flue-cured tobacco warehouse operators and dealers.

    (a) Warehouse registration. For burley and flue-cured tobacco, any 
warehouse operator dealing in either flue-cured or burley tobacco shall 
be registered with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Such registration 
will be handled by the North Carolina State FSA Office, Raleigh, North 
Carolina.
    (b) Dealer registration. Each person who expects to deal in burley 
or flue-cured tobacco during a marketing year shall complete a Dealer 
Application and Agreement (MQ-79-2-A) annually, except dealers who are 
exempt from maintaining or filing records and reports as provided in 
Sec. 723.405. The application must be filed after March 1 of the 
calendar year in which the marketing year begins, and shall be filed 
with the State FSA office or, if designated by the State Executive 
Director, the county FSA office for the county where the dealer resides 
or where the dealer's principal business is located. The applicant shall 
provide the names, and such other information as required by the Deputy 
Administrator, of all other persons who will be authorized to use the 
dealer identification card (MQ-79-2). A dealer entity is limited to one 
dealer registration number. Persons affiliated with another dealer of 
the same household shall not be eligible for a dealer registration 
number unless the Deputy Administrator determines that the entities or 
individuals are separate and independent.
    (c) Approval of application and agreement. The State Executive 
Director of the State FSA office shall, under the direction of the 
Deputy Administrator, be the approving official for the Dealer 
Application and Agreement. If the approving official has reason to doubt 
that the applicant is a bona fide dealer or intends to become a bona 
fide dealer, the application may be disapproved until such time as the 
applicant furnishes information satisfactory to the State FSA committee 
that the application is bona fide. An application shall also be 
disapproved for any person who has failed to file reports or permit 
inspections required in Sec. 723.404(d)(9). A person whose application 
is disapproved shall be provided with the opportunity to appeal the 
disapproval and to furnish information to substantiate the application 
or to comply with other requirements in Sec. 723.404.
    (d) Letter of credit or bond--(1) General requirements. Effective 
with the beginning of the 1992 marketing year for burley tobacco and 
with the 1993 marketing year for flue-cured tobacco, in order to secure 
the payment of penalties as may be incurred by a dealer during the 
marketing year for which approval as a dealer is sought, each dealer, as 
a condition for final approval to handle tobacco, must present a letter 
of credit or bond which is determined by the Deputy Administrator to be 
acceptable security and which meets the dollar requirements of this 
section. The letter of credit or bond shall be submitted to the State 
FSA office where the dealer is registered. A letter of credit must have 
been issued by a commercial bank insured by the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation. A bond must be a surety bond insured by a bonding 
company or agent licensed in the State where the dealer is registered. 
The letter of credit or bond must be in the form and have the content 
specified by the Deputy Administrator. A letter of credit or bond shall 
be furnished annually after initial approval of the dealer's application 
and notification of the amount required. The dealer identification card 
shall not

[[Page 155]]

be issued until it is determined that acceptable security has been 
presented.
    (2) Amount required. The base amount of the letter of credit or bond 
shall be the larger of:
    (i) $25,000 or
    (ii) the sum of the amounts determined by multiplying the respective 
pounds of burley and flue-cured tobacco purchased by the dealer during 
the preceding marketing year by 10 percent of the marketing year penalty 
rate for the respective kind of tobacco involved for the relevant year 
with the resulting amount not to exceed $100,000.

A dealer shall submit the letter of credit or bond for the base amount 
plus an amount equal to the amount of any unpaid tobacco marketing quota 
penalty owed by such dealer. The amount shall also be increased by 
$5,000 for each 10,000 pounds of tobacco for which the dealer has failed 
to file reports or filed false reports in violation of Sec. 723.404 for 
the 3 previous marketing years. The Deputy Administrator may reduce the 
amount of security required in order to avoid undue hardship and shall 
make provision for release of the letter of credit or bond at the 
appropriate time.
    (e) Suspension and surrender of dealer card. The dealer 
identification card shall be surrendered upon demand of the FSA. Failure 
to comply with the provisions of Secs. 723.404 or 723.414 or with other 
material provisions of this part shall be cause for suspension of the 
dealer identification card and the dealer shall be given 15 days to 
complete all necessary compliance measures or to show cause why the card 
should not remain suspended.

Sec. 723.402  Warehouse authorized to retain producer marketing cards between sales.

    (a) General. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this part, to 
facilitate the scheduling of farmer's tobacco to the warehouse, 
marketing cards, with the permission of the producer, may be retained at 
the warehouse between sales even though no producer on the farm for 
which the card is issued has tobacco on the floor for sale or to be 
settled for, as provided in this section.
    (b) Warehouse eligible to retain producers marketing cards between 
sales. A warehouse shall be eligible to retain producer marketing cards 
between sales if the operator thereof shall:
    (1) Execute and file on a form approved by FSA a written request 
with the State FSA committee (or county FSA committee if designated by 
the State FSA committee).
    (2) Agree to be responsible to FSA for an amount of money equal to 
that amount that may be assessed against any producer as marketing quota 
penalties, if the marketing that is the basis of assessment of penalty 
occurred while the warehouse was authorized to have custody of the 
marketing card, for:
    (i) Burley or flue-cured tobacco for any overmarketing resulting 
from errors made at the warehouse in entering ``balance after sale'' 
pounds on the producer's marketing card or failure to deduct pounds sold 
on producer's marketing card.
    (ii) Tobacco falsely identified for marketing by use of the 
producer's marketing card.
    (iii) Producer's failure to account for any tobacco marketed by use 
of the producer's marketing card.
    (iv) Any burley or flue-cured tobacco marketed at the warehouse in 
excess of 103 percent of quota as shown on the producer's marketing 
card.
    (3) Agree to maintain an accurate and up-to-date journal containing 
a listing of all producer marketing cards retained by the warehouse to 
facilitate the scheduling of farmer's tobacco. The journal shall show 
for each card retained the:
    (i) Name of the operator;
    (ii) Serial number of farm;
    (iii) Marketing card number, if applicable;
    (iv) Date marketing card obtained from producer; and
    (v) Date marketing card returned to producer.

Such journals shall be maintained for the length of time and under the 
conditions required for other warehouse records.
    (4) Agree to return the marketing card to the producer at any time 
the

[[Page 156]]

producer may so request, or in the absence of a request, return it to 
the producer within 7 days after the close of the warehouse for the 
season.
    (5) Agree that this authorization may be terminated by FSA for 
failure to comply with provisions of this agreement.
    (c) Penalties considered to be the responsibility of warehouse 
operators. Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, a warehouse 
operator who executes and files a written request with the State FSA 
committee (or county FSA committee if designated by the State FSA 
committee) for authorization to retain producer's marketing cards at the 
warehouse, with grower permission, shall be responsible to FSA for an 
amount of money equal to the amount that may be assessed against the 
producer as marketing quota penalties if the marketing that is the basis 
of such assessment occurred while the warehouse was authorized to have 
custody of the marketing card, for:
    (1) Any burley or flue-cured tobacco overmarketings resulting from 
errors made at the warehouse in entering ``balance after sale'' pounds 
on the burley or flue-cured producer's marketing card or failure to 
deduct pounds sold on the producer's marketing card. However, the 
warehouse operator shall not be responsible for any penalty under this 
subparagraph, if such penalty would not have been assessed against the 
producer in accordance with Sec. 723.409(e) of this part.
    (2) Tobacco falsely identified for marketing by use of the 
producer's marketing card.
    (3) Producer's failure to account for any tobacco marketed by use of 
such producer's marketing card.
    (4) With respect to burley or flue-cured producers, tobacco marketed 
at the warehouse in excess of 103 percent of quota as shown on the 
producer's marketing card.


<R05>

    (e) Identification of tobacco for marketing--(1) Marketing card. 
Each marketing of tobacco from a farm in any State for which a farm 
marketing quota has been established for any kind of tobacco shall be 
identified by a marketing card issued for the farm on which such tobacco 
was produced (unless prior to the marketing of such tobacco an AMS 
inspection certificate is obtained showing that the tobacco offered for 
sale is a kind of tobacco not subject to marketing quotas).
    (2) Recording farm identification. For burley or flue-cured tobacco, 
at the time the tobacco is weighed in, the warehouse operator shall 
record on the tobacco sale bill, the State and county codes and the farm 
serial number from the marketing card issued for the farm from which the 
tobacco is to be marketed.
    (3) Return of marketing card. For tobacco that is to be sold at 
auction, the warehouse operator shall retain the marketing card until 
the producer has been paid for the sale of the tobacco or the tobacco is 
removed from the warehouse by the producer at which time the marketing 
card shall be returned to the producer. In any case where a producer's 
marketing card is found in the possession of a warehouse operator, and 
no producer on the farm for which the card is issued has tobacco on the 
floor for sale, or tobacco for which settlement is not yet completed, 
such card will be picked up by an FSA representative for return to the 
producer. The warehouse operator shall be responsible for the 
safekeeping and proper use of the marketing card during such person's 
retention of the marketing card.
    (4) No price support. For burley or flue-cured tobacco, if tobacco 
is to be marketed at auction from a farm for which a marketing card is 
issued bearing the notation ``No Price Support'', the warehouse operator 
shall enter the same notation on the tobacco sale bill at the time the 
tobacco is weighed in for sale. The warehouse operator shall prepare a 
separate tobacco sale bill to cover any tobacco which represents more 
than 103 percent of the effective farm marketing quota and the notation 
``No Price Support'' shall be shown on such tobacco sale bill. The sale 
of such tobacco shall be considered a separate sale.
    (5) Nonauction purchase. The warehouse operator shall enter the 
letters ``NA'' on each line of a tobacco sale bill on which there is 
recorded tobacco purchased by or for the warehouse at nonauction sale 
and shall record on all such tobacco sale bills:
    (i) For burley or flue-cured tobacco, the farm serial number from 
the marketing card that is used to identify the

[[Page 158]]

tobacco at the time of the nonauction purchase.
    (ii) For tobacco other than burley or flue-cured, the serial number 
of the marketing card that is used to identify the tobacco at the time 
of the nonauction purchase.
    (6) Copy of sale bill. The warehouse operator shall furnish to the 
producer a copy of the tobacco sale bill bearing the letters ``NA'' for 
any lot of such tobacco purchased by the warehouse operator.
    (7) Lot ticket. At the time tobacco is weighed for marketing, the 
warehouse operator shall record the weight of the lot of tobacco on the 
tobacco sale bill and on the lot ticket. The sale bill number on which 
the lot of tobacco is recorded shall be recorded on the lot ticket. If 
the marketing card which is presented to identify the tobacco at weigh-
in bears the notation ``No Price Support,'' the same notation shall be 
entered by the warehouse operator on the lot ticket for each lot of 
tobacco which is identified with the same marketing card.
    (8) Recording serial number of marketing card. For tobacco other 
than burley or flue-cured, before the tobacco is offered for sale, the 
warehouse operator shall record, on the sale bill, the serial number of 
the Form MQ-76 or MQ-77 issued for the farm from which the tobacco is to 
be marketed at auction.
    (9) Recording sale bill number. For tobacco other than burley or 
flue-cured, the serial number of the sale bill shall be recorded:
    (i) By the warehouse operator on the check register or check stub 
from the check written to cover an auction sale of tobacco by a 
producer.
    (ii) On the inside of the marketing card by the marketing recorder 
or warehouse operator for each sale of tobacco by a producer.
    (10) Burley or flue-cured marketings. A marketing card used to cover 
a sale of burley or flue-cured tobacco shall show on the reverse side 
the poundage balance of the ``103 percent of quota.''
    (i) Auction sale. At the time of weigh-in the tobacco sale bill 
shall show the poundage balance of 103 percent of the farm's quota. The 
tobacco sale bill shall show the pounds on which penalty is due, and the 
amount of penalty.
    (ii) Nonauction sale to a warehouse operator at the warehouse. If 
the tobacco sale bill includes both an auction sale and a nonauction 
sale such combined pounds shall be used to compute and reflect the 
balance of the ``103 percent of quota.'' The tobacco sale bill shall 
show the pounds on which penalty is due and the amount of the penalty.
    (iii) Nonauction country purchase by a warehouse operator. The 
warehouse operator shall deduct, from the balance of the ``103 percent 
of quota'' entry on the marketing card, the pounds of tobacco purchased 
as a nonauction country purchase. In addition, each warehouse operator 
shall record on Form MQ-79 and on Form MQ-72-2, Report of Tobacco 
Nonauction Purchase, each nonauction country purchase of tobacco made by 
such warehouse operator. The data to be reported on Form MQ-72-2 is set 
forth in Sec. 723.404 of this part.
    (11) Sale memo and bill of nonauction sales. For tobacco other than 
burley or flue-cured, a record of sales on Forms MQ-76, MQ-77, or MQ-82, 
Sale Without Marketing Card (including sale memo from MQ-77 or MQ-82), 
shall be obtained by a warehouse operator to cover each marketing of 
tobacco from a farm through a warehouse and each nonauction sale of 
tobacco purchased by or for the warehouse operator including scrap 
tobacco obtained as a result of providing curing space or stripping 
space for farmers. Each MQ-76 and MQ-77 (including sale memo) shall be 
executed as follows:
    (i) Auction sale. An auction sale identified by MQ-76 shall show in 
the spaces provided thereon, the sale bill number, check-mark to show 
the sale was by auction, a check-mark to show nonauction for purchases 
identified ``NA'' on the sale bill, pounds sold, name and address of 
warehouse, and date of sale. In addition, each sale memo issued from MQ-
77 to cover an auction sale shall show on the first page thereof in all 
of the spaces provided therefor, the warehouse bill number, pounds sold, 
amount of penalty due, name and address of warehouse, and date of sale.
    (ii) Nonauction sale to a warehouse operator who does not prepare a 
sale bill.

[[Page 159]]

An MQ-76 used to cover a nonauction sale of tobacco to a warehouse 
operator who does not prepare a sale bill to cover the sale shall show, 
a check-mark to indicate sale was by nonauction, pounds sold, name and 
address of the warehouse, and date of sale. When an MQ-77 is used under 
this paragraph, a sale memo shall be executed, including the signature 
of the producer on the reverse side.
    (iii) Nonauction sale to a warehouse operator who prepares a sale 
bill. When a warehouse operator purchases:
    (A) All the delivery of a producer's tobacco at a nonauction sale 
and prepares a sale bill to cover the purchase, on MQ-76 there shall be 
shown the bill number, check-mark to show nonauction purchases, pounds 
sold, name and address of warehouse, and date of sale. When an MQ-77 is 
used a sale memo shall be executed, including the signature of the 
producer on the reverse side.
    (B) Part of a delivery of a producer's tobacco as a nonauction 
purchase and the remainder of the tobacco is sold at auction, if such 
tobacco is identified by an MQ-76 the Record of Sales shall be completed 
to show the name and address of the warehouse, the date of sale, the 
sale bill number, check-mark under both auction and nonauction, and, 
under ``Lbs. Sold,'' the total number of pounds covered by the entire 
delivery. If the sale is identified by an MQ-77, the sale memo (front) 
shall be completed to show the sale bill number, the total number of 
pounds covered by the entire delivery under ``Lbs. Sold,'' the amount of 
penalty due, name and address of the warehouse, and the date of sale. In 
addition, the reverse side of the sale memo shall show the number of 
pounds sold at nonauction.
    (f) Nonquota tobacco or quota tobacco of a different kind. If 
tobacco is presented for sale that is represented to be nonquota tobacco 
or should there be a question as to what kind of quota tobacco is being 
offered for sale, an inspection shall be obtained from the Agricultural 
Marketing Service of this Department (AMS) after the tobacco is weighed 
and in line for sale. The lot ticket for the tobacco shall be cross-
referenced to the sale bill by sale bill number and date. The sale bill 
shall show the producer's name and address and the State and county code 
and farm number of the farm on which the tobacco was produced. If an AMS 
inspection shows that a lot of tobacco is of a different kind than that 
identified by the lot ticket, such tobacco shall be deleted from the 
original sale bill and a revised sale bill prepared. Copies of the lot 
ticket and sale bill shall be furnished to the State FSA office at the 
end of the sale day.
    (g) Labeling tobacco sale bill for resale tobacco. In the case of 
resales, each sale bill shall show ``resale'' and;
    (1) For dealers, the name of the dealer making each resale; and
    (2) For the warehouse, the name of the warehouse and either ``floor 
sweepings'' or ``leaf account'' tobacco.
    (h) Suspended sale record. (1) Any tobacco sale bill covering sale 
of tobacco for which a valid marketing card or dealer identification 
card was not presented at the end of the sale day shall be given to a 
marketing recorder who shall stamp such bills, ``Suspended'', and shall 
handle according to instructions provided by the Deputy Administrator.
    (2) When cleared, such suspended sale shall show ``suspended-
cleared'' and date cleared. If a suspended sale is not cleared from 
suspension by the last auction sale day for the warehouse for the season 
(or for burley tobacco only, within 7 days of the sale if such date is 
earlier), it shall be considered a sale of excess tobacco and penalty at 
the full rate shall be remitted by the warehouse operator.
    (i) Payee to be shown on auction warehouse check. Any auction 
warehouse which issues a check to cover the auction or nonauction sale 
of tobacco shall issue such check only in the name of the payee. A 
warehouse check shall not be issued in the name of the seller and 
bearer, for example ``John Doe or Bearer.''
    (j) Warehouse entries on other dealer's reports. Each warehouse 
operator shall record, or have the dealer record, on a Form MQ-79 the 
total purchases and resales made by each such dealer or other warehouse 
operator during each sale day at the warehouse. Warehouse operators 
shall sign the Form MQ-79 on

[[Page 160]]

the same line as the transaction is recorded when a dealer resells 
tobacco at the warehouse. If any tobacco resold by the dealer and 
carried over by the dealer from a crop produced prior to the current 
crop, an entry shall be made on the MQ-79 to clearly show such fact.
    (k) Warehouse data for burley or flue-cured tobacco. (1) Each 
operator of a burley or flue-cured tobacco auction warehouse shall 
prepare at the end of each sale day a report on MQ-80, Daily Warehouse

credit for the next marketing year shall be allowed for the damaged 
tobacco and the amount of pounds of damaged tobacco shall be deducted 
from the operator's purchase credit for the current year,
    (ii) Permit its inspection by a representative of FSA, and
    (iii) Provide for the weighing of such tobacco, to be witnessed by

determining the amount of penalty, if penalty is due.
    (4) The warehouse operator shall furnish to the marketing recorder a

    (iii) The reweighed quantity shall be the official pounds to be 
credited to the account as carryover tobacco.
    (iv) If upon reinspection by a representative of FSA, there is an 
amount of tobacco determined to be damaged tobacco, the pounds of 
damaged tobacco shall be deducted from the purchase credit, if not done 
so previously, and no carryover credit shall be allowed for such damaged 
tobacco for the next marketing year.
    (l) Warehouse data for tobacco other than burley or flue-cured. (1) 
Each operator of a tobacco auction warehouse, other than the operator of 
a burley or flue-cured auction warehouse, shall prepare and promptly

    (5) At the end of the season, each warehouse operator shall:

shall not change the MQ-76 or MQ-80 on which the sale was reported. If 
the warehouse operator gains possession of the tobacco, and it is resold 
by such warehouse operator, it shall be identified as resale tobacco.
    (p) Report to county FSA office of long weights and long lots. Each 
warehouse operator shall report to the county FSA office or marketing 
recorder long weights and long lots of producer tobacco (first sales) 
for which the farmer has been paid.
    (q) Record and report of warehouse operator's leaf account purchases

the local auction markets.
    (4) A remittance for all penalties shown by the entries on Form MQ-
79 and Form MQ-72-2 to be due shall be forwarded to the State FSA office 
with the original copy of MQ-79.
    (5) Resales of floor sweepings shall be reported separately from 
leaf account tobacco.
    (r) Buyers corrections account. Each warehouse operator shall keep 
such records including negative adjustment invoices as will enable the 
warehouse operator to furnish a weekly report on Form MQ-71 to the State 
FSA office showing the total pounds of the debits (for returned lots, 
short lots, and short weights of tobacco) and the credits (for long lots 
and long weights of tobacco) to the buyers corrections account. Where 
the warehouse operator returns to the seller tobacco debited to the 
buyers corrections account, the warehouse operator shall prepare an 
adjustment invoice to the seller. This invoice shall be the basis for a 
credit entry for the warehouse in the buyers corrections account and a 
corresponding purchase (debit entry) in the case of a dealer on such

farm.
    (u) Report of farm scrap resulting from furnishing stripping space 
for farmers. Any warehouse operator or any other person who provides

tobacco obtained from each farm resulting from providing such space.
    (v) Producer tobacco. Producer tobacco (first sale) in possession of 
a warehouse operator, resulting from long weights and long lots, which 
has not previously been identified by a sale shall be recorded and 
reported in the same manner as a nonauction sale to a warehouse operator 
who does not prepare a warehouse bill (floor sheet) and shall be 
reported on MQ-79, Dealer's Record. Penalty shall be due on this tobacco 
at the full penalty rate for the respective kind of tobacco or, if the

Record'' contained in MQ-79, which is issued to the dealer, and shall 
transmit such receipt to the applicable State FSA office.
    (b) Record of marketings. A dealer shall keep records which provide 
the following information for each lot of tobacco, including scrap 
tobacco, purchased or sold by the dealer:
    (1) Purchases. (i) The name of:

    (C) The seller if purchased as a nonauction purchase from a 
warehouse operator or dealer.
    (ii) The identification number of the warehouse, farm, or dealer, as 
applicable, at/from which the tobacco was purchased.
    (iii) The address, the producer association number, if applicable, 
and percentage share of the proceeds of the farm operator and any other 
producer from whom tobacco was purchased as a nonauction purchase.
    (iv) The date of purchase.
    (v) The pounds of tobacco purchased.
    (vi) The gross purchase price.
    (vii) The amount of penalty.

    (2) Sales. (i) The name and identification number of the:
    (A) Warehouse through which the tobacco was sold, if sold at a 
warehouse auction, or
    (B) Buyer if the tobacco was sold at a nonauction sale.
    (ii) The date of sale.
    (iii) The pounds of tobacco sold.
    (iv) The gross sale price.
    (c) Nonauction purchase. (1) Each purchase of tobacco from a

card, issued for the farm on which the tobacco was produced unless an 
AMS inspection is obtained prior to purchase which shows that tobacco 
being offered for sale is a kind not subject to marketing quotas.
    (2) For burley and flue-cured tobacco:
    (i) After each nonauction purchase, the dealer shall enter a 
declining balance of ``103 percent of quota'' on the reverse side of the 
marketing card. The declining balance shall be determined by reducing 
the previous ``103 percent of quota'' entry on the marketing card by the 
number of pounds of tobacco purchased. The date the tobacco was 
purchased also shall be entered on the marketing card at the time each 
lot of tobacco is purchased.
    (ii) After each nonauction purchase, the dealer shall prepare a form 
MQ-72-2 which shall set forth the following:
    (A) The date of the purchase.
    (B) The registration number of the dealer.
    (C) The name and address of the person selling the tobacco.
    (D) The identification number (farm number, warehouse code, or 
dealer number, as applicable) of the person selling the tobacco.

1464 of this title. The dealer may deduct the producer's share of each 
assessment from the price paid for the tobacco. However, the No Net Cost 
Assessment shall not be remitted from a producer who identifies the 
tobacco for marketing with a marketing card which has zero pounds as the 
103 percent entry on the marketing card. A marketing penalty at the full 
rate shall be collected on the marketings identified by such card. The 
amount of the No Net Cost and the Tobacco Marketing Assessments which is 
applicable to tobacco marketed during each marketing year will be the 
amount per pound which is approved and announced by the Secretary.

[[Page 165]]

    (3) For all other kinds of tobacco:
    (i) When a Form MQ-77 Marketing Card is used to identify a 
nonauction sale, the producer's signature shall be obtained on the 
reverse side of a sale memo which is a part of the Form MQ-77. A 
nonauction sale not identified by a marketing card shall be identified 
by a Form MQ-82 executed by a marketing recorder or other representative 
of the State FSA committee. The dealer shall record each nonauction 
purchase of tobacco on Form MQ-79, Dealer's Record.
    (ii) For nonauction purchases which are made by the dealer from 
producers, the dealer shall remit the producer's and the dealer's share 
of the No Net Cost and Tobacco Marketing Assessments as provided in part 
1464 of this title. The dealer may deduct the producer's share of each 
assessment from the price paid for the tobacco. However, the No Net Cost 
Assessment shall not be remitted from a producer if the marketing card 
used to identify a kind of tobacco shows a converted penalty rate of 100 
percent. A marketing penalty at the full rate shall be collected on the 
marketings identified by such card. The amount of the No Net Cost and 
the Tobacco Marketing Assessments which is applicable for each kind of 
tobacco marketed during each marketing year will be the amount per pound 
which is approved and announced by the Secretary.
    (d) Record and report of purchases and resales. (1) For burley and 
flue-cured tobacco, each dealer shall keep a record and make reports on 
Form MQ-79 showing all purchases and resales, excluding tobacco not in 
the form normally marketed by producers. After each transaction is 
entered on the Form MQ-79, each dealer shall enter a balance to reflect 
the pounds of tobacco remaining that may be sold without causing prior 
resales to exceed prior purchases. Any tobacco sold in excess of such 
balance shall be considered excess tobacco and subject to a marketing 
quota penalty at the full penalty rate. The purchaser shall sign the 
Form MQ-79 on the same line as the transaction is recorded by the dealer 
who is offering such tobacco for resale. In the event of a purchase or 
resale of tobacco which is purchased by the dealer from a crop of 
tobacco produced prior to the current crop, the Form MQ-79 shall be 
annotated to indicate that such tobacco was so purchased and carried 
over from a crop produced prior to the current crop.
    (2) For all other kinds of tobacco, each dealer shall keep a record 
and make reports on Form MQ-79 showing all purchases and resales of 
tobacco made by or for the dealer and, in the event of a purchase or 
resale of tobacco which is purchased prior to the current crop, the fact 
that such tobacco was so purchased and carried over from a crop produced 
prior to the current crop.
    (3) A Form MQ-79 shall be prepared and a copy (together with 
executed copies of Form MQ-72-2 for all nonauction purchases of burley 
and flue-cured tobacco) shall be forwarded to the State FSA office not 
later than the end of the calendar week in which such tobacco was 
purchased or resold. However, if tobacco is purchased prior to the 
opening of the local auction market, a Form MQ-79 shall be prepared and 
a copy, together with executed copies of Form MQ-72-2 for all nonauction 
purchases, shall be forwarded to the State FSA office not later than the 
end of the calendar week which would include the first sale date of the 
local auction markets. In addition, if tobacco is resold in a State 
other than where the tobacco is produced and the auction markets at such 
location open earlier than the auction market where the tobacco normally 
would be sold at auction by farmers, reports together with executed 
copies of Form MQ-72-2 for all nonauction purchases shall be prepared 
and forwarded to the State FSA office not later than the end of the 
calendar week which would include the first day of the local auction 
market where the resale takes place.
    (4) The data to be entered on Form MQ-72-2 for nonauction purchases 
from a producer shall be the data which is enumerated in accordance with 
the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (5) At the end of the dealer's marketing operation, but not later 
than April 1 for tobacco other than flue-cured and January 15 for flue-
cured tobacco, such dealer shall for each kind of tobacco:

[[Page 166]]

    (i) Show the word ``final'' on the Dealer's Report, MQ-79, for the 
season,
    (ii) Report on such ``final'' MQ-79 for the season the quantity of 
tobacco on hand and its location,
    (iii) Permit its inspection by a representative of FSA, and
    (iv) Provide for weighing of such tobacco (to be witnessed by a 
representative of FSA) and furnish a certification as to the actual 
weight of such tobacco. After the weight of such tobacco has been 
determined as provided in this section, it shall be considered as the 
official weight for comparing purchases and resales for the purpose of 
determining the amount of penalty, if penalty is due.
    (v) If upon inspection by a representative of FSA, there is an 
amount of tobacco determined to be damaged tobacco according to 
Sec. 723.104, such amount of pounds shall be deducted from the purchase 
credit and no carryover credit shall be allowed for such damaged tobacco 
for the next marketing year.
    (6) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d)(5) of this 
section, any dealer having tobacco transactions after January 15 for 
flue-cured and April 1 for other than flue-cured shall make reports on 
Form MQ-79 at the end of each week, as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of 
this section.
    (7) For burley and flue-cured tobacco, before the next marketing 
season begins, carryover tobacco reported by the dealer as provided in 
paragraph (d)(5) of this section shall be reinspected by a 
representative of FSA. When the reinspection indicates an amount of 
carryover tobacco different from that amount determined by the initial 
inspection, the dealer shall provide for the weighing of such tobacco 
which shall be witnessed by an FSA representative. The dealer shall 
furnish to such representative at the time of weighing a certification 
as to the actual weight of such tobacco. If an FSA representative 
determines that the weight of the tobacco is different, by reweighing, 
than the amount reported on the initial weight together with the 
reweighed quantity after taking into consideration any purchases and 
resales that occurred subsequent to the initial certification as 
provided in paragraph (d)(5) of this section shall be used for the 
purpose of determining penalty, if penalty is due. Penalty shall be 
assessed, after the initial certification and reconciliation, when the 
redetermined pounds exceed the amount determined by taking the initial 
pounds of carryover tobacco plus purchases, minus resales. The 
redetermined pounds shall be the official pounds to be credited to the 
account as carryover. If upon reinspection by a representative of FSA, 
there is an amount of tobacco determined to be damaged tobacco under 
Sec. 723.104, such amount of pounds shall be deducted from the purchase 
credit and no carryover credit shall be allowed for such damaged tobacco 
for the next marketing year.
    (8) In addition to forms MQ-79 and MQ-72-2, if applicable, form MQ-
79 (Supplemental) shall be executed to record information relating to 
each nonauction purchase of tobacco for which the No Net Cost and 
Tobacco Marketing Assessments are due from producers and dealers. The 
form MQ-79 (Supplemental) shall be forwarded to the State FSA office at 
the same time as the purchase is reported on the MQ-79. A check, draft, 
or money order in the amount of the collections recorded on form MQ-79 
(Supplemental) and made payable to Commodity Credit Corporation shall be 
submitted to the State FSA office along with the forms MQ-79 and MQ-79 
(Supplemental).
    (9) Any flue-cured or burley dealer who fails to comply with all 
provisions of paragraph (d)(5) of this section by January 15 for flue-
cured and April 1 for burley tobacco will be issued a notice of 
noncompliance and the dealer shall be given 15 days to either comply or 
show cause why compliance is not feasible. Failure to complete all 
required actions within 15 days from date of such notice shall result in 
such dealer not being issued a MQ-79-2 for the marketing year 
immediately following the marketing year in which the dealer failed to 
conform with the deadline of January 15 for flue-cured and April 1 for 
burley tobacco.
    (e) Daily report to warehouse operator for buyers correction 
account. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 723.405 of

[[Page 167]]

this part, reports shall be made as follows:
    (1) Any dealer, buyer, or any other person receiving tobacco from or 
through a warehouse operator at an auction sale or otherwise, which is 
not invoiced to such person or which is incorrectly invoiced to such 
person by the warehouse operator, shall furnish to the warehouse 
operator on a daily sales basis an adjustment invoice or buyers 
settlement sheet.
    (2) Each dealer who purchases tobacco on a warehouse floor for any 
sale day in which there is no adjustment required in the account as 
shown on the warehouse bill-out invoice for that sale day, shall file a 
negative report with the warehouse operator for that sale day.
    (3) Such reports as required under paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this 
section shall be furnished daily, if practicable (otherwise, they shall 
be furnished at the end of each week), and shall show the identification 
number of the warehouse where the purchase was made.
    (f) Reporting of processed tobacco. Any dealer who delivers tobacco 
to a firm for the purpose of redrying, processing or stemming of such 
tobacco shall, by the end of the week in which such tobacco was 
delivered, report to the State FSA office on MQ-79, Dealer's Report:
    (1) The date delivered;
    (2) Name and address of the firm to which the tobacco was delivered; 
and
    (3) Pounds of tobacco (green weight) delivered which shall be 
entered in the resales pounds column. Such tobacco shall be considered 
as a resale on the date of delivery for the purpose of balancing the 
dealer account and collection of penalties where penalties are due.
    (g) Tobacco represented to be a nonquota kind. Any dealer who plans 
to purchase tobacco that was produced on a farm in a quota area shall 
treat such tobacco as a quota kind of tobacco according to the 
provisions of this part 723 unless prior to the purchase a certification 
is obtained from an AMS inspector to indicate that such tobacco is a 
nonquota kind of tobacco. In such case, the dealer shall mail or 
otherwise deliver to the State FSA office, on the date of the purchase, 
a copy of the AMS certification and a statement signed by the AMS 
inspector, the producer, and the dealer to indicate the:
    (1) State and county code and farm number of the farm on which the 
tobacco was produced.
    (2) Name and address of the producer.
    (3) Name and address of the dealer.
    (4) Weight of the tobacco.

Sec. 723.404 of this part except for the requirements which relate to 
the reporting of nonauction purchases from producers and the 
requirements of Sec. 723.404(e) of this part. A dealer or buyer whose

(October 1 through September 30 for burley tobacco and July 1 through 
June 30 for flue-cured tobacco) which is not included in the initial 
report shall be reported in like manner no later than the end of the

Sec. 723.406  Provisions applicable to damaged tobacco or to purchases of tobacco from processors or manufacturers.

    (a) Damaged tobacco. Any dealer, warehouse operator, or other person 
who intends to purchase damaged tobacco shall notify the State FSA 
office where the warehouse operator or dealer is registered or should be 
registered. Such report must be made at least 2 business days in advance 
of the purchase so as to allow for inspection arrangements to be made. 
The inspection shall be conducted by an FSA representative and no 
purchase credit shall be allowed the buyer for the quantity determined 
to be damaged tobacco. Damaged tobacco may be disposed of without 
incurring a penalty only if the tobacco is destroyed and the destruction 
is witnessed by an FSA representative or the tobacco is sold directly to 
a processor or manufacturer and such sale is reported to the same State 
FSA office. Any tobacco not disposed of in that manner shall be deemed 
to have been a marketing of excess tobacco and will be subject to a 
penalty at the full penalty rate for the quantity of tobacco involved.
    (b) Purchase from processor or manufacturer. Any tobacco purchased 
by a dealer, warehouse operator, or other person from a processor or 
manufacturer shall be considered to be tobacco in the form not normally 
marketed by producers unless the purchaser obtains from the processor or 
manufacturer a certification stating that such purchased tobacco is in 
the form normally marketed by producers. The certification by the 
processor or manufacturer shall be on a form prescribed by the Deputy 
Administrator certifying to FSA that the tobacco involved in the 
transfer of ownership is in the form normally marketed by producers. No 
purchase credit shall be given to a dealer, warehouse operator, or other 
person on MQ-79, Dealer's Record Book, for any purchase of tobacco which 
is not in the form normally marketed by producers. Tobacco which meets 
the definition of pickings as defined in this part shall be considered 
tobacco in the form not normally marketed by producers.
    (c) Report by dealer or warehouse operator. Any dealer, warehouse 
operator or other person who plans to purchase tobacco in the form 
normally marketed by producers from a processor or manufacturer shall, 
prior to purchase, report such plans to the State FSA office issuing 
form MQ-79, Dealer's Record Book, to such person. Such report shall be 
made timely so that a representative of FSA may inspect the tobacco to 
determine its marketable value and whether the tobacco is in the form 
normally marketed by producers. Any tobacco purchased from processors or 
manufacturers before such plans are reported to the state FSA office and 
before the tobacco is inspected by an FSA representative or an 
inspection is declined by an FSA representative shall be deemed excess 
tobacco and the penalty at the full rate shall be due.
    (d) Report by processor or manufacturer. Each processor or 
manufacturer shall make a report to the Director, showing the quantity 
of tobacco sold in the form not normally marketed by producers to 
dealers and buyers other than processor or manufacturers. The report 
shall be filed no later than the end of the calendar week following the 
week in which such tobacco was sold and shall show the name of the 
purchaser, the date of the sale and the pounds sold.
    (e) Dealer records and reports. (1) Any dealer, warehouse operator 
or other

[[Page 169]]

persons who purchased tobacco classified as not in the form normally 
marketed by producers shall keep such records as will enable such person 
to report to the State FSA office the following:
    (i) Name of seller, pounds purchased, and date of purchase.
    (ii) The disposition of such tobacco including name of buyer, pounds 
sold, date of sale,
    (2) Upon request by the State FSA office such person shall provide 
for the inspection and weighting of the tobacco to be witnessed by an 
FSA representative.

    (i) Selling it for the producers, or
    (ii) Placing it under price-support loan through Commodity Credit 
Corporation.
    (2) Report of buyer's name and address. Each buyer shall properly 
execute, detach, and promptly forward to the State FSA office, ``Receipt 
for Buyer's Record'' contained in MQ-79 (CF&B), which is issued to the 
buyer.
    (b) Record of purchases. A buyer shall keep records which provide 
the following information for each lot of each kind of tobacco purchased 
or sold by the buyer, including tobacco obtained from grading tobacco 
for producers or furnishing curing space, or stripping space:
    (1) The name of:
    (i) The operator of the farm on which the tobacco was produced; or
    (ii) The name and address of the seller, in the case of a sale by a 
person other than the farm operator.
    (2) The identification number of the farm at/from which the tobacco 
was purchased.
    (3) The date of purchase.
    (4) The pounds of tobacco purchased.
    (5) The gross purchase price.
    (6) The amount of penalty.
    (7) The amounts remitted for the No Net Cost and Tobacco Marketing

the No Net Cost and Tobacco Marketing Assessments as provided in part 
1464 of this title. The dealer may deduct the producer's share of each 
assessment from the price paid for the tobacco. The No Net Cost 
Assessment shall not be collected from a producer who identifies the 
tobacco for marketing with a marketing card which has a converted 
penalty rate of 100 percent on the marketing card. A marketing penalty 
at the full rate shall be collected on the marketings identified by such 
card. The amount of the No Net Cost and the Tobacco Marketing 
Assessments which is applicable to tobacco marketed during each 
marketing year will be the amount per pound which is approved and 
announced by the Secretary.
    (e) Identification of sale or marketing card memo and buyers 
records. Each MQ-76 and each sale memo from an MQ-77 used to identify 
each sale of tobacco by a producer shall be properly executed by the 
buyer. The serial number of the MQ-76 marketing card or sale memo from 
an HQ-77 to identify such tobacco, shall be recorded on the buyer's copy 
of the MQ-79 (CF&B) and on the check register or check stub for the 
check written with respect to such tobacco.
    (f) Record and report of purchases of tobacco from producers. (1) 
Each buyer shall keep a record and make reports on MQ-79 (CF&B), Buyer's 
Record, showing by kinds of tobacco purchased by or for such buyer from 
producers. Such record and report shall show for each sale the sale 
date, the name of the farm operator, (and the name and address of the 
person selling the tobacco if other than the operator), the serial 
number of the within quota marketing card (MQ-76), and from each excess 
card (MQ-77), the sale memo number used to identify the sale, the pounds 
of tobacco represented in the sale, the rate of penalty shown on the 
sale

[[Page 170]]

memo (MQ-77), and the amount of penalty. If a marketing card is not 
presented by the producer, the buyer shall record and report the 
purchase as provided above except that the buyer shall enter the word 
``None'' in the space for the serial number of the marketing card (MQ-
76) or sale memo (MQ-77), the applicable rate of penalty per pound in 
the space for rate of penalty, and shall show the name and address of 
the seller in the space for the seller's name.
    (2) The original of MQ-79 (CF&B), excess sale memos (MQ-77), and a 
remittance for all penalties shown by entries on MQ-79 (CF&B) and on the 
excess sale memos (MQ-77) to be due shall be forwarded to the State FSA

form MQ-79 (Supplemental) shall be forwarded to the State FSA office at 
the same time as the purchase is reported on the MQ-79. A check, draft, 
or money order in the amount of the collections recorded on form MQ-79 
(Supplemental) and made payable to Commodity Credit Corporation shall be 
submitted to the State FSA office along with the forms MQ-79 and MQ-79 
(Supplemental).

<R05>
Sec. 723.408  Producer's records and reports.

    (a) Failure to file reports or filing false reports. (1) With 
respect to any kind of tobacco, if the producer on a farm files an 
incomplete or incorrect report, fails to file a report, or files or aids 
or acquiesces in the filing of any false report with respect to the 
amount of such kind of tobacco produced on or marketed from the farm, 
applicable tobacco acreage allotment or burley farm marketing quota next 
established for such farm shall be reduced, unless the county and State 
FSA committees determine, according to instructions issued by the Deputy 
Administrator, that such reduction is not required.
    (2) For all kinds of tobacco except burley tobacco, if a farm 
operator files a report of acreage of the applicable kind of tobacco on 
the farm and, after a determination of the acreage, it is determined by 
the county FSA committee (with approval of the State FSA committee) that 
the report was false (either significantly under reported or 
significantly over reported by more than the tolerance for reporting as 
provided in part 718 of this chapter) in what amounts to a scheme or 
device to defeat the purpose of the program, the allotment next 
established for the farm shall be reduced by an amount determined by 
multiplying the acreage falsely reported (difference between reported 
and determined acreage) by:
    (i) With respect to flue-cured tobacco, the farm yield established 
for the farm for the year in which the false report was filed, or
    (ii) For any other kind of tobacco, the actual yield per acre for 
the year in which the false report was filed.
    (3) Any report of a marketing of tobacco by a producer or any use of 
producer's marketing card to sell the tobacco or the pledge the tobacco 
for a price support loan shall be considered the filing of a false 
report by the producer and, in addition to other remedies as may apply, 
the remedies provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall apply, 
if, under the provisions of part 1464 of this title, the producer was 
not considered to have been an ``eligible producer'' with respect to 
such marketing or other disposition of tobacco.
    (b) Harvesting second crop tobacco from the same farm. For all kinds 
of tobacco except burley, if in the same calendar year more than one 
crop of tobacco was grown from:
    (1) The same tobacco plants, or
    (2) Different tobacco plants, and is harvested for marketing from 
the same acreage of a farm, the acreage allotment next established for 
such farm shall be reduced by an amount equivalent to the acreage from 
which more than one crop of tobacco was so grown and harvested.
    (c) False identification. If there is false identification of any 
kind of tobacco,

[[Page 171]]

the applicable farm acreage allotment or farm marketing quota next 
established for the farm and kind of tobacco involved shall be reduced, 
except that such reduction for any such farm shall not be made if the 
county and State FSA committees determine, according to instructions 
issued by the Deputy Administrator, that such reduction is not required.
    (d) Report on marketing card. (1) The operator of each farm on which 
tobacco is produced shall return to the county FSA office each marketing 
card issued for the farm whenever marketings from the farm are completed 
and, in no event, later than,
    (i) June 1 of the marketing year in the case of cigar tobacco, and
    (ii) For all other kinds of tobacco, not later than 20 days after 
the close of the tobacco auction markets for the marketing year for the 
locality in which the farm is located. Failure to return the marketing 
card within 15 days after written request by certified mail from the 
county FSA executive director shall constitute failure to account for 
disposition of all tobacco marketed from the farm unless disposition of 
tobacco marketed from the farm is otherwise accounted for to the 
satisfaction of the county FSA committee.
    (2) For all kinds of tobacco except burley and flue-cured:
    (i) At the time the marketing card is returned to the county FSA 
office, the farm operator must certify with respect to each:
    (A) MQ-77, to the quantity of tobacco on hand and its location.
    (B) MQ-76, to the accuracy of the Record of Sales recorded on the 
card.
    (ii) Failure of the farm operator to make the applicable 
certification shall constitute failure to satisfactorily account for the 
disposition of tobacco marketed from the farm.
    (3) Upon failure to satisfactorily account to the county FSA 
committee for disposition of tobacco marketed from the farm the 
allotment or quota next established for such farm and such kind of 
tobacco shall be reduced, except that such reduction for any such farm 
shall not be made if it is established to the satisfaction of the county 
FSA committee and a representative of the State FSA committee that the 
failure to furnish such proof of disposition was unintentional and no 
producer on such farm could reasonably have been expected to furnish 
such proof of disposition. However, such failure will be construed as 
intentional unless such proof of disposition is furnished and payment of 
all additional penalty is made, or no person connected with such farm 
for the year for which the acreage allotment or quota is being 
established caused, aided, or acquiesced in the failure to furnish such 
proof.
    (e) Report of production and disposition. (1) In addition to any 
other reports which may be required by this subpart, the operator or any 
producer on a farm (even though the harvested acreage does not exceed 
the acreage allotment or even though no farm acreage allotment or farm 
marketing quota was established for the farm) shall, upon written 
request by certified mail from the State or county FSA committee, 
furnish on MQ-108, Report of Production and Disposition, a written 
report of the acreage, production and disposition of all tobacco 
produced on the farm by sending the same to the State or county FSA 
committee within 15 days after the request was mailed showing as to the 
farm at the time of filing such report with respect to the applicable 
kind of tobacco the:
    (i) Total harvested acres,
    (ii) Total amount of tobacco on hand and its location,
    (iii) Total pounds of tobacco produced,
    (iv) Name and address of the warehouse operator, dealer, or other 
person to or through whom tobacco was marketed, and the number of pounds 
marketed, the gross price paid and the date of the marketings, and
    (v) Complete details as to any tobacco disposed of other than by 
sale.
    (2) With respect to any farm on which burley or flue-cured tobacco 
was produced or available for marketing from carryover tobacco, the 
operator or any producer on the farm (even though the harvested acreage 
does not exceed the flue cured farm acreage allotment or even though no 
farm acreage allotment or farm marketing quota was established for the 
farm) shall, upon written

[[Page 172]]

request from the county FSA committee, furnish on Form MQ-108-1, Report 
of Unmarketed Tobacco, a written report of the amount and location of 
the applicable kind of tobacco produced on the farm which is unmarketed 
at the end of the marketing season and the amount the applicable kind of 
tobacco produced by such operator or producer on any other farm, which 
is unmarketed at the end of the marketing season and which is stored on 
the farm, by sending the report to the county FSA committee within 15 
days after the request was mailed to such person at such person's last 
known address.
    (3) Failure to file the MQ-108 or MQ-108-1 as requested, or the 
filing of MQ-108 or MQ-108-1 which is found by the State or county FSA 
committee to be incomplete or incorrect shall, to the extent that it 
involves tobacco produced on the farm, constitute failure to account for 
the disposition of tobacco produced on the farm and the allotment or 
quota next established for such farm shall be reduced, except that such 
reduction shall not be made if it is established to the satisfaction of 
the county or State FSA committee that failure to furnish such proof of 
disposition was unintentional and no producer on such farm could 
reasonably have been expected to furnish such proof of disposition: 
However, such failure will be construed as intentional unless such proof 
of disposition is furnished and payment of all additional penalty is 
made, or no person connected with such farm for the year for which the 
farm acreage allotment or farm marketing quota is being established 
caused, aided, acquiesced in the failure to furnish such proof.
    (f) Reports by producer-manufacturers. (1) For all kinds of tobacco 
except burley and flue-cured tobacco, each producer who manufactures 
tobacco products from tobacco produced by or for such person as a 
producer, shall report to the State FSA office with respect to each farm 
on which such tobacco is produced and as soon as all tobacco from the 
farm has been weighed as follows:
    (i) If the harvested acreage is within the allotment, the producer-
manufacturer shall report the total pounds of tobacco produced, the 
date(s) on which such tobacco was weighed, the farm serial number of the 
farm on which it was produced, and the estimated value of such tobacco.
    (ii) If the harvested acreage is in excess of the allotment, the 
producer-manufacturer shall report the total pounds of tobacco produced 
on the farm, the date(s) on which the tobacco was weighed, the farm 
serial number of the farm on which it was produced, the estimated value 
of the tobacco, and the location of the tobacco. If the required reports 
are not made, penalty shall be paid on the tobacco by the producer-
manufacturer, at the converted rate of penalty shown on the marketing 
card issued for the farm, when it is moved from the place where it can 
be conveniently inspected by the county FSA committee at any time 
separate and apart from any other tobacco.
    (2) If the producer-manufacturer has excess tobacco and does not pay 
the penalty thereon at the converted rate of penalty shown on the 
marketing card, such producer-manufacturer shall notify in writing the 
buyer of the manufactured product or the buyer of any residue resulting 
from processing the tobacco, at time of sale of such product or residue, 
of the precise amount of penalty due on such manufactured product or 
residue. In such event, the producer-manufacturer shall immediately 
notify the State FSA executive director and shall account for the 
disposition of such tobacco by furnishing the State FSA executive 
director a report on a form to be furnished by such State FSA executive 
director, showing the name and address of the buyer of the manufactured 
products or residue, a detailed account of the disposition of such 
tobacco and the exact amounts of penalty due with respect to each such 
sale of such products or residue to indicate, together with copies of 
the written notice that was given to the buyer of such products or 
residue to indicate the exact amount of the penalty due.
    (3) Failure to file the report required in paragraph (f)(2) of this 
section, or the filing of a report which is found by the State FSA 
committee to be incomplete or incorrect, shall be considered failure of 
the producer-manufacturer

[[Page 173]]

to account for the disposition of tobacco produced on the farm and the 
allotment next established for the farm shall be reduced for such 
failure, except that such reduction for any such farm shall not be made 
if it is established to the satisfaction of the county and State FSA 
committees, that:
    (i) The failure to furnish such report of disposition was 
unintentional and the producer-manufacturer on such farm could not 
reasonably have been expected to furnish such report of disposition. 
However such failure will be construed as intentional unless such report 
of disposition is furnished and payment of all additional penalty is 
made, or
    (ii) No person connected with such farm for the year for which the 
allotment is being established caused, aided, or acquiesced in the 
failure to furnish such report. The producer-manufacturer shall be 
liable for the payment of penalty.
    (g) Amount of allotment or quota reductions--(1) Burley tobacco. For 
burley tobacco, the farm marketing quota determined for a farm for the 
current year shall be reduced by that amount of tobacco which is 
involved in a marketing quota violation as described in paragraphs (a), 
(b), (c), (d), or (e), of this section which occurred in any prior year. 
However, the amount of such reduction shall not exceed the current year 
farm marketing quota. The county FSA committee shall determine the 
amount of tobacco involved in the marketing quota violation. If the 
actual quantity of tobacco involved in such violation is unknown, the 
county FSA committee shall determine the quantity by considering both 
the condition of the crop during production, if known, and such other 
information as is available.
    (2) Kinds of tobacco except burley tobacco. The amount of reduction 
in the allotment for the current year for a violation described in 
paragraphs (a), (c), (d), (e), or (f) of this section shall be that 
percentage, but not to exceed 100 percent, which the amount of the 
tobacco involved in the violation is of the respective farm marketing 
quota for the farm for the year in which the violation occurred times 
the current year farm acreage allotment. The quantity of tobacco in 
violation shall be determined by the county FSA committee. If known, the 
actual quantity shall be determined by the county FSA committee to be 
the amount of tobacco involved in the violation. If the actual quantity 
is unknown, determine the quantity by taking into consideration the 
condition of the crop during production, if known, and such other 
information that is available.
    (h) Allotment or quota reduction for combined farms. If the farm 
involved in the violation is combined with another farm prior to the 
reduction, the allotment or quota reduction shall be applied as 
heretofore provided in this section to that portion of the farm acreage 
allotment or farm marketing quota for which a reduction is required.
    (i) Allotment or quota reduction for divided farms. If the farm 
involved in the violation has been divided prior to the reduction, the 
reduction shall be applied as heretofore provided in this section to the 
allotments or quota for the divided farms required to be reduced.
    (j) Quota reductions for flue-cured tobacco. For flue-cured tobacco 
only, if an acreage allotment reduction is made under this section, the 
marketing quota shall be reduced to reflect such reduction in an amount 
determined by multiplying the acreage reduction by the farm yield.
    (k) County administrative hearing in connection with violations. 
Except for the failure to return a marketing card, the allotment or 
quota for any farm shall not be reduced for a violation under this 
section until the operator of the farm has been afforded an opportunity 
to discuss the nature and extent of the violation with the county FSA 
committee. If after having been afforded an opportunity to discuss a 
violation with the county FSA committee the farm operator fails or 
refused to discuss the violation, the county FSA committee shall take 
action as required by this part.
    (l) Sequence of allotment or quota reductions. For burley and flue-
cured tobacco, if the tobacco farm acreage allotment or farm marketing 
quota for a farm is to be reduced in the current year because of both:
    (1) A violation, and

[[Page 174]]

    (2) Overmarketings in a prior year, the reduction in the farm 
acreage allotment or farm marketing quota for the violation shall be 
made before making the reduction for overmarketings.
    (m) Correction of farm records. For burley and flue-cured tobacco, 
where farm data for actual marketings are determined to be incorrect 
because of a violation, the records shall be corrected for each farm on 
which the tobacco was produced, and for each farm whose card was used to 
identify marketings.
    (n) Report on Form MQ-92, Estimate of Production. An estimate of 
production, Form MQ-92, shall be prepared immediately prior to harvest 
for each farm for which the county or State FSA committee or a 
representative of the county or State FSA committee believes than an MQ-
92 for the farm would be in the best interests of the program. The 
county FSA committee shall have the authority to visit any farm for the 
purposes of making an estimate of production or determination of planted 
acreage needed to complete an estimate of production.
    (o) Effect of false identification on establishing future farm 
marketing quotas. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, 
with respect to burley or flue-cured tobacco, if a producer falsely 
identifies such tobacco as having been produced on or marketed from a 
farm, the quantity of the tobacco which is falsely identified shall be 
considered, for the purpose of establishing future farm marketing 
quotas, as having been produced on both the farm for which it was 
identified as having been produced, and the farm of actual production, 
if known, or, as the case may be, such quantity of tobacco shall be 
considered as actually marketed from the farm.

<R05>
Sec. 723.409  Producer violations, penalties, false identification collections and remittances by dealers, buyers, handlers, warehouses, and other parties; 
          related issues.

    (a) Generally--(1) Circumstances in which penalties are due. A 
penalty shall be due on all marketings from a farm which are:
    (i) In excess of the applicable quota or allotment;
    (ii) Made without a valid marketing card;
    (iii) Made under circumstances where a buyer or dealer, or their 
agents, know, or have reason to know, that the tobacco was, or is, 
marketed in a manner which by itself or in combination with other 
marketings is designed to, or has the effect of, defeating the purposes 
of the tobacco price support and production adjustment program, avoiding 
marketing quota limitations, or otherwise avoiding provisions of this 
part or part 1464 of this title;
    (iv) Falsely identified; or,
    (v) Marketings for which the producer or other party fails to make a 
proper account as required by the provisions of this part.
    (2) Amount of the penalty. The amount of the penalty shall be the 
amount computed by multiplying the penalty rate by the penalty quantity.
    (3) Penalty rate. The penalty rate for purposes of this section is 
that rate which is computed as the penalty rate per pound for the 
applicable kind of tobacco under Sec. 723.308, except to the extent that 
a converted penalty rate may be used as provided for in this section.
    (4) Penalty quantity. The penalty quantity for purposes of this 
section is the quantity of tobacco that is determined by the county FSA 
committee subject to the Director's review to be subject to penalty, 
provided further that:
    (i) For burley and flue-cured tobacco, the penalty quantity for 
purposes of this section shall be the amount of marketings from the farm 
in excess of 103 percent of the farm's effective marketing quota for 
that year, except that if the violation involves false identification or 
a failure to account for tobacco, the FSA may, in its discretion, 
depending on the nature of the violations, use as the penalty quantity 
an amount up to 25 percent of the farm's effective marketing quota plus 
100 percent of the farm yield on any excess acreage for the farm 
(acreage planted in excess of the allotted acres, as estimated or 
determined).
    (ii) For tobacco other than burley and flue-cured tobacco, the 
penalty

[[Page 175]]

quantity shall be the amount of marketings from the farm in excess of 
the farm's marketing quota provided further, that in order to aid in the 
collection of the penalty the FSA may endeavor, to the extent 
practicable, to apply the penalty to all of the farm's marketing by 
converting the full penalty rate to a converted proportionate penalty 
rate which rate may be identified on the producer's marketing card and 
collected and remitted accordingly. In making the calculation of the 
converted penalty rate, the agency shall take into account any carryover 
tobacco applicable for the farm. If an erroneous penalty rate is shown 
on the marketing card, then the producer of the tobacco and the producer 
who marketed the tobacco shall be liable for any balance due.
    (5) Limitations on reduced penalty quantities. No penalty shall be 
assessed at less than the maximum amount unless it is determined by the 
county FSA committee, with the concurrence of the State FSA committee, 
that all of the following exist with respect to such violation:
    (i) The violation was inadvertent and unintentional;
    (ii) All of the farm's production has been accounted for and there 
are no excess marketings for which there are penalties outstanding;
    (iii) The records for all involved farms have been corrected to show 
the marketings involved; and
    (iv) The false identification or failure to account did not give the 
producer an advantage under the program.
    (6) Effect of improper, invalid, deceptive or unaccounted for 
marketings on penalty quantity calculation. Any marketing made without a 
valid marketing card, falsely identified, or unaccounted for in 
accordance with the requirements of this part, or made under 
circumstances which are designed to, or have the effect of, defeating 
the purpose of the tobacco marketing quota and price support program, 
avoiding any limitation on marketings, avoiding a penalty, or avoiding 
compliance with, or the requirements of, any regulation under this part 
or under part 1464 of this title, shall be considered an excess 
marketing of tobacco. Further, such marketings shall, unless shown to 
the satisfaction of the county FSA committee to be otherwise, be 
considered, where relevant, to be in excess of 103 percent of the 
applicable marketing quota for the farm, and shall be subject to a 
penalty at the full penalty rate for each pound so marketed.
    (7) Pledging of tobacco by an ineligible producer. In addition to 
any other circumstances in which a penalty may be assessed under this 
part, the marketing or pledging for a price support loan of any tobacco 
when the producer is not considered to be an ``eligible producer'' under 
the provisions of part 1464 of this title, shall be considered to be a 
false identification of tobacco and shall be dealt with accordingly. 
This remedy shall be in addition to all others as may apply.
    (8) Failures to make certain reports. If any producer who 
manufactures tobacco products from tobacco produced by such person or 
another fails to make the report required by Sec. 723.408(f) or 
otherwise required by this part, or makes a false report, such producer 
shall be deemed to have failed to account for the disposition of tobacco 
produced on the farm(s) involved. The filing of a report by a producer 
under Sec. 723.408 of this part which the State FSA committee finds to 
be incomplete or incorrect shall constitute a failure to account for the 
disposition of tobacco produced on the farm.
    (b) Special provisions for tobacco buyers, dealers, handlers, 
warehouse operators and others who acquire, handle, or facilitate the 
marketing of tobacco. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of 
this section and other provisions of this part:
    (1) Unless such amount has been remitted by another in accord with 
the provisions of this part, a dealer, buyer, warehouse operator or 
other person handling tobacco shall collect, and remit to FSA, an amount 
equal to the full penalty rate provided for in Sec. 723.208 times the 
quantity of tobacco involved where the tobacco is not identified with a 
valid producer or dealer card, the tobacco is sold under suspicious 
circumstances, or when there is reason to suspect that the tobacco may 
be subject to a penalty for any reason or may be marketed in derogation 
of the goals and purposes of the tobacco

[[Page 176]]

support program. For purposes of the preceding sentence ``handling'' 
shall include any services provided with respect to the tobacco, and any 
facilitation of the marketing of tobacco regardless of the level or 
amount of contact, if any, that the party may actually have with the 
tobacco.
    (2) The amount of the penalty required to be collected may be 
deducted from the proceeds due a seller and all parties chargeable under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be jointly and severally liable 
for insuring that the monies are remitted to FSA except to the extent 
that the Director shall allow for an exemption to facilitate the 
marketing of tobacco, or for some other reason.
    (3) The collection and remittance of penalty shall be in addition to 
any other obligations that such person may have to collect other 
amounts, including other penalties or assessments due on such 
marketings.
    (4) If a penalty is collected and remitted by a buyer, dealer, or 
warehouse operator that is shown not to be due or only partially due, 
then the overpayment shall be refunded to the appropriate party. It is 
the responsibility of the person that collected the penalty and the 
person that sold the tobacco involved to show to the satisfaction of the 
FSA that such penalty is not due in the full amount collected.
    (c) Canceled allotment or quota. If part or all of the tobacco 
produced on a farm has been marketed and the farm acreage allotment or 
farm marketing quota for the farm is canceled, any penalty due on the 
marketings shall be paid by the producers.
    (d) Overmarketing proportionate share of effective farm marketing 
quota-burley or flue-cured tobacco. With respect to burley or flue cured 
tobacco, if the county FSA committee determines that the farm operator 
or another producer on the farm has marketed more than 103 percent of 
such operator's or producer's share of the effective farm marketing 
quota with intent to deprive some other producer on the farm from 
marketing such producer's proportionate share of the same crop of 
tobacco, such operator or other producer shall be liable for marketing 
penalties at the full rate per pound for each pound of tobacco marketed 
above 103 percent of such producer's share of the effective farm 
marketing quota. However, the sum of such penalties shall not exceed the 
total penalties due on total marketings above 103 percent of the 
effective farm marketing quota for the farm on which such tobacco was 
produced. Before assessment of penalty pursuant to this paragraph, a 
hearing shall be scheduled by the county FSA committee and the operator 
and affected producers shall be invited to be present, or to be 
represented, to determine whether the operator or another producer on 
the farm has marketed more than 103 percent of such person's 
proportionate share of the effective farm marketing quota. The notice of 
the hearing shall request the farm operator and affected producers to 
bring to the hearing floor sheets and other relevant supporting 
documents. At least two members of the county FSA committee shall be 
present at the hearing. The hearing shall be held at the time and place 
named in the notice and any action taken to impose penalty shall be 
taken after the hearing. If the farm operator or other affected producer 
does not attend the hearing, or is not represented, the county FSA 
committee shall make a determination on the basis of available records 
and shall assess any penalties that may be required against the 
applicable person.
    (e) Penalties not to be assessed-burley or flue-cured tobacco. With 
respect to burley or flue-cured tobacco, if the operator or another 
producer on the farm markets a quantity of tobacco above 103 percent of 
the effective farm marketing quota for the farm and such overage is 
found to have been caused by the failure to record or improper recording 
of tobacco poundage data on the marketing card, that amount of the 
penalty as was due to such failure to record or improper recording will 
not be required to be paid by the farm operator or other producer if:
    (1) For amounts of $100 or less, the county FSA committee, and
    (2) For amounts over $100, the county FSA committee with approval of 
the State FSA committee determines that each of the following conditions 
is applicable:

[[Page 177]]

    (i) The failure to record or incorrect recording resulted from 
action or inaction of a marketing recorder or another FSA employee, and
    (ii) The farm operator or another producer on the farm had no 
knowledge of such failure or error. Overmarketings for a farm for which 
the marketing penalty will not be paid pursuant to the provisions of 
this paragraph shall be determined based upon the correct effective farm 
marketing quota and correct actual marketings of tobacco from the farm.
    (f) Refusal to contribute required assessments. A marketing penalty 
at the full rate per pound is due on each pound of tobacco marketed from 
a farm when the farm operator or producers refuse to pay no-net-cost or 
marketing assessments as provided in part 1464 of this title. In all 
such cases, the farm from which the tobacco has been produced shall be 
considered to have a marketing quota of zero pounds and an allotment of 
zero acres.

Sec. 723.410  Penalties considered to be due from warehouse operators, dealers, buyers, and others excluding the producer.

    Subject to any additional requirements or provisions for remittances 
which are contained in Sec. 723.409 of this part, any marketing of 
tobacco under one of the following conditions shall be considered to be 
a marketing of excess tobacco.
    (a) Auction sale without burley or flue-cured tobacco marketing 
card. For burley and flue-cured tobacco, any first marketing of tobacco 
at an auction sale by a producer which is not identified by a valid 
marketing card at the time of marketing shall be considered to be a 
marketing of excess tobacco and the penalty thereon shall be collected 
and remitted by the warehouse operator unless prior to marketing, an AMS 
inspection certificate is obtained showing that the tobacco is of a kind 
not subject to marketing quotas.
    (b) Auction sale without dark air-cured, fire-cured, or Virginia 
sun-cured tobacco marketing card. For dark air-cured, fire-cured, or 
Virginia sun-cured tobacco, any first marketing of tobacco at an auction 
sale by a producer which is not identified by a valid marketing card 
(MQ-76 or MQ-77 (including sale memo)) on or before the last warehouse 
sale day of the marketing season, or within 4 weeks following the date 
of marketing, whichever comes first, shall be identified by an MQ-82, 
and shall be presumed, subject to rebuttal, to be a marketing of excess 
tobacco. The penalty thereon shall be paid by the warehouse operator.
    (c) Burley or flue-cured tobacco nonauction sale. For burley and 
flue-cured tobacco, any nonauction marketing of tobacco which:
    (1) Is not identified by a valid marketing card and recorded at the 
time of marketing on MQ-79, Dealer's Report, the marketing card, and MQ-
72-2, Report of Tobacco Nonauction Purchase; or,
    (2) If purchased prior to the opening of the local auction market 
for the current year, it is not identified by a valid marketing card and 
recorded on MQ-79, the marketing card, and MQ-72-2, Report of Tobacco 
Nonauction Purchase not later than the end of the calendar week which 
includes the first sale day of the local auction markets, shall be 
considered a marketing of excess tobacco. The penalty thereon shall be 
collected by the purchaser of such tobacco, and remitted with MQ-79, 
unless prior to marketing an AMS inspection certificate is obtained 
showing that the tobacco is of a kind not subject to marketing quotas.
    (d) Nonauction sale, except burley, flue-cured, and cigar tobacco. 
For dark air-cured, fire-cured, or Virginia sun-cured tobacco, any 
nonauction sale of tobacco which:
    (1) Is not identified by an MQ-76 or MQ-77 (including a valid sale 
memo); and
    (2) Recorded on MQ-79, Dealer's Record, not later than the end of 
the calendar week in which the tobacco was purchased; or
    (3) If purchased prior to the opening of the local auction market 
for the current year, is not identified by an MQ-76 or MQ-77 (including 
a valid sale memo) and recorded on MQ-79 not later than the end of the 
calendar week which includes the first day of the

[[Page 178]]

local auction markets, shall be presumed, subject to rebuttal, to be a 
marketing of excess tobacco. The penalty thereon shall be paid by the 
purchaser of such tobacco.
    (e) Failure to obtain an MQ-76 and sale memo, and failure to record 
a sale on MQ-76-cigar tobacco. Any sale of cigar tobacco for which a 
dealer:
    (1) If within quota, fails to record the sale on the marketing card 
issued for the farm, or
    (2) If the tobacco was produced on a farm for which an excess 
marketing card was issued, fails to obtain a valid sale memo by the end 
of the sale date, shall be presumed, subject to rebuttal, to be a 
marketing of excess tobacco. The penalty thereon shall be paid by the 
buyer who fails to make the required record.
    (f) Leaf account tobacco. If warehouse resales exceed prior leaf 
account purchases, such marketings shall be considered to be a marketing 
of excess tobacco unless such warehouse operator furnishes evidence 
acceptable to the State FSA committee showing that such marketing is not 
a marketing of excess tobacco. However, evidence acceptable to the State 
FSA committee shall not be based on the warehouse operator's proof of 
purchase of tobacco that is not in the form normally marketed by 
producers even though such evidence indicates that resales exceed prior 
leaf account purchases as a result of the blending of tobacco, which was 
not in the form normally marketed by producers, with the warehouse 
operator's prior purchases of leaf account tobacco.
    (g) Dealer tobacco--burley and flue-cured. The burley or flue-cured 
tobacco resales by a dealer (as shown or due to be shown on Form MQ-79), 
which are in excess of such dealer's total prior purchases of the 
respective kind of tobacco shall be considered to be a marketing of 
excess tobacco and penalty thereon shall be due at the time the 
marketing takes place which results in the excess. If the resale which 
results in penalty being due is made at auction, the warehouse shall 
deduct the penalty from the proceeds of the sale and shall remit the 
penalty to the marketing recorder. If the resale which results in 
penalty being due is made at nonauction, the purchaser shall deduct the 
penalty from the proceeds of the sale and shall remit the penalty to the 
applicable State FSA office.
    (h) Resales not reported. Any resale of tobacco which is required to 
be reported by a warehouse operator or dealer, but which is not reported 
within the time and in the manner required, shall be considered to be a 
marketing of excess tobacco, unless and until such warehouse operator or 
dealer furnishes proof of such resale which is acceptable to the State 
FSA executive director. The penalty thereon shall be paid by the 
warehouse operator or dealer who fails to make the report as required.
    (i) Marketing falsely identified by a person other than the producer 
of the tobacco. If any marketing of tobacco by a person other than the 
producer is identified by a marketing card other than the marketing card 
issued for the farm on which the tobacco was produced, and the source of 
production of the tobacco is unknown, such marketing shall be presumed, 
subject to rebuttal, to be a marketing of excess tobacco. The marketing 
quota penalty shall be paid by the person who marketed the tobacco.
    (j) Carryover tobacco, except cigar tobacco. Any tobacco on hand, 
except for cigar tobacco, and reported or due to be reported under 
Sec. 723.403 of this part for warehouse operators and Sec. 723.404 of 
this part for dealers shall be included as a resale in determining 
whether an account for a kind of tobacco has excess resales. Unless the 
warehouse operator furnishes proof acceptable to the State FSA committee 
and unless the dealer furnishes proof acceptable to the State FSA 
executive director, showing that such account does not represent excess 
tobacco, penalty at the full rate for the respective kind of tobacco 
shall be paid thereon by such warehouse operator or dealer.
    (k) Unrecorded sale of cigar tobacco. Any sale of cigar tobacco 
which is not recorded on MQ-79 (CF&B), Buyer's Record Book, by the 10th 
day of the month following the month during which the sale dated 
occurred shall be presumed, subject to rebuttal, to be a

[[Page 179]]

marketing of excess tobacco. The penalty thereon shall be paid by the 
buyer who fails to make the record.
    (l) Floor sweepings. Any person who markets floor sweepings in 
excess of allowable floor sweepings shall be subject to a civil penalty 
of 150 percent of the average market price for the immediately preceding 
marketing year, as determined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The 
calculated penalty rate shall be rounded to the nearest whole cent. Any 
floor sweepings on hand more than 30 days (15 days with respect to flue-
cured tobacco) after the warehouse closes for the auction season shall 
be considered marketed. The floor sweepings on hand shall be weighed by 
the warehouse operator and the weight shall be certified by the 
warehouse operator, such weighing to be done in the presence of a 
representative of either the county FSA committee or State FSA 
committee. Floor sweepings which are destroyed in the presence of a 
representative of the county FSA committee, within 30 days (15 days with 
respect to flue-cured tobacco) after the warehouse closes shall not be 
considered as marketed when determining the quantity of floor sweepings 
marketed. If the county FSA committee determines, after the warehouse 
has been closed for the auction season for more than 30 days (15 days 
with respect to flue-cured tobacco), that the cumulative quantity of 
floor sweepings marketed and considered marketed in the current 
marketing year is in excess of the allowable floor sweepings, the person 
responsible for such marketings shall be given notice of the 
determination and shall be afforded an opportunity to request 
reconsideration of such determination in accordance with the provisions 
of part 780 of this chapter. A determination that a civil penalty is due 
for marketing floor sweepings in excess of the allowable floor sweepings 
shall not become final and shall not be assessed until such person has 
been afforded an opportunity for a hearing and such person has exhausted 
the applicable administrative remedies. The notice of assessment shall 
require such person to pay the civil penalty to the ``Farm Service 
Agency, USDA'' within 15 days after the mailing of the notice.
    (m) Blending tobacco not in the form normally marketed by producers-
-burley and flue-cured tobacco. Tobacco purchased from processors or 
manufacturers that is considered not in the form normally marketed by 
producers that is blended with tobacco in the form normally marketed by 
producers shall not be credited as a purchase to the dealer's or 
warehouse operator's account by the State FSA committee when reconciling 
the warehouse operator's leaf account or the dealer's purchases and 
resales. Tobacco not in the form normally marketed by producers that is 
blended with other tobacco shall be deemed to be excess tobacco and 
penalty shall be due on the pounds of tobacco by which a warehouse 
operator's or dealer's resales exceed prior purchases.
    (n) Advances and other cases in which the producer's marketing card 
is used improperly. For tobacco of any kind to which this part applies, 
if tobacco is marketed by a person by using the producer's marketing 
card or the tobacco is pledged for a price support loan by using that 
card, but under the provisions of part 1464 of this title, the producer 
is deemed to have not been an ``eligible producer'' with respect to the 
disposition of that tobacco at the time because of an advance or other 
preauction arrangement, such disposition of the tobacco shall be 
considered a false identification of the tobacco and may be considered 
to be a marketing of excess tobacco. In such cases, the person who paid 
the advance, took possession of the tobacco, or made the agreement with 
the producer which made the producer no longer an ``eligible producer'' 
with respect to the tobacco, shall be jointly and severally liable with 
the producer for any penalty with respect to such disposition which is 
levied against the producer under the provisions of this part and 
additionally, if such disposition is determined to be a marketing of 
excess tobacco, shall be liable for a penalty calculated by using the 
penalty rate for the tobacco involved multiplied by the pounds of 
tobacco involved. These remedies shall be in addition to any other 
remedies which may apply, including but not limited to, any liability 
for a refund of any price support

[[Page 180]]

loan advances which were paid in the name of, or for the account of, the 
producer of the tobacco.

part, the firm is only required to report such tobacco received for 
storage that does not belong to such firm.


<R05>
Sec. 723.412  Separate records and reports from persons engaged in tobacco related businesses.

    Any person who is required to keep any record or make any report as 
a warehouse operator, dealer, buyer, trucker, or as a person engaged in 
the hauling, processing, or storage of tobacco, and who is engaged in 
more than one such business, shall keep such records as will enable such

person is engaged to the same extent for each such business as if the 
person were engaged in no other business.


<R05>
Sec. 723.413  Length of time records and reports are to be kept.

    Records to be kept and copies of the reports required to be made by

submitting complete reports and keeping accurate records shall be 
subject to an additional fine, not to exceed $5,000.
    (2) Failure to obtain producer marketing card or sale memo. The 
failure of any dealer or warehouse operator to obtain a:
    (i) Producer's marketing card, MQ-76 and MQ-77, to identify a sale 
of producer tobacco, or
    (ii) Dealer identification card, MQ-79-2, to cover a resale of 
tobacco, shall constitute a failure to make a report.
    (b) False representation--warehouse operators, dealers, and 
processors. The monetary penalties described in this part are in 
addition to penalties prescribed by other criminal statutes including 18 
U.S.C. 231 which provides for a fine of not more than $10,000 or

Subpart E--Establishing Burley and Flue-Cured Tobacco National Marketing 
                                 Quotas

    Source: 63 FR 11583, Mar. 10, 1998, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 723.501  Scope.

    This subpart sets out regulations for setting annual national 
marketing quotas for burley and flue-cured tobacco based on the purchase 
intentions of certain manufacturers of cigarettes and on other factors. 
It also sets out penalty provisions for manufacturers who fail to 
purchase, within the tolerances set in this part, the amount of domestic 
tobacco, by kind, reflected in the stated intention as accounted for in 
accordance with this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 723.502  Definitions.

    In addition to the definitions set forth at Sec. 723.104, the 
definitions set forth in this section shall be applicable for purposes 
of administering the provisions of this subpart.
    CCC. The Commodity Credit Corporation, an instrumentality of the 
USDA.
    Domestic manufacturer. A domestic manufacturer of cigarettes.
    Domestic manufacturer of cigarettes. A manufacturer, who as 
determined by the Director, produces and sells more than 1 percent of 
the cigarettes produced and sold in the United States annually.
    Price support inventory. The inventory of tobacco which, with 
respect to a particular kind of tobacco, has been pledged as collateral 
for a price support loan made by CCC through a producer-owned 
cooperative marketing association.
    Producer owned cooperative marketing associations. Those 
associations or their successors, which by law act as agents for 
producers for price support loans for tobacco, and which were, as of 
January 1, 1996, for burley and flue-cured tobacco, the Burley Tobacco 
Growers Cooperative Association, the Burley Stabilization Corporation, 
and the Flue-Cured Tobacco Cooperative Stabilization Corporation.
    Unmanufactured tobacco. Stemmed and unstemmed leaf tobacco, stems, 
trimmings, and scrap tobacco.


<R05>
Sec. 723.503  Establishing the quotas.

    (a) General. Subject to the 3-percent adjustment provided for in 
paragraph (b) of this section, the annual marketing quotas for burley 
and flue-cured tobacco shall be calculated for each marketing year for 
each kind separately as follows:
    (1) Domestic manufacturer purchase intentions. First, for each kind 
and year, the Director shall calculate the aggregate relevant purchaser 
intentions as declared or set under this section.
    (2) Exports. Next, the Director shall add to the total determined 
under paragraph (a)(1) of this section the amount which is equal to the 
Director's determination of the average quantity of exported domestic 
leaf tobacco of the applicable kind for the past 3 marketing years. For 
this purpose, exports include unmanufactured tobacco only, including, 
but not limited to, stemmed and unstemmed leaf tobacco, stems, 
trimmings, and scrap tobacco, and excludes tobacco contained in 
manufactured products including, but not limited to, cigarettes, cigars, 
smoking tobacco, chewing tobacco, snuff and semi-processed bulk smoking 
tobacco. The quantity of exports for the most recent year, as needed, 
may be estimated.
    (3) Reserve stock level adjustment. The total calculated by adding 
the sums of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section may be adjusted 
by the Director as necessary to maintain inventories of producer loan 
associations for burley and flue-cured tobacco at the reserve stock 
level. For burley, the reserve stock level is the larger of 50 million 
pounds farm sales weight or 15 percent of the previous year's national 
market quota. For flue-cured, the reserve stock level is the larger of 
60 million pounds or 10 percent of the previous year's quota. The 
Director shall

[[Page 183]]

consider supply conditions when making any adjustment and a downward 
adjustment for burley tobacco may not exceed either 35 million pounds 
farm sales weight or 50 percent of the amount by which loan inventories 
exceed the reserve stock level, whichever is larger. If the uncommitted 
pool stocks of burley tobacco for 2001 and subsequent crops equal or are 
less than the reserve stock level, then the downward adjustment in quota 
for that year may be made based on the reserve stock level for that kind 
of tobacco, with no downward limitation.
    (b) Additional 3-percent adjustment. The amount otherwise calculated 
under paragraph (a) of this section may be adjusted by the Director by 3 
percent of the total. This adjustment is discretionary and may be made 
irrespective of whether any adjustment has been made under paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section and may be made to the extent the Director deems 
such an adjustment is in the best interest of the program.
    (c) Dates of announcement. For flue-cured tobacco, the quota 
determination should be announced by December 15 preceding the marketing 
year. For burley, the announcement should be made by February 1 
preceding the marketing year.

67 FR 62871, Oct. 9, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 723.504  Manufacturers' intentions; penalties.

    (a) Generally. Each domestic manufacturer shall, for each marketing 
year, for burley and flue-cured tobacco separately, submit a statement 
of its intended purchases of eligible tobacco by the date prescribed in 
paragraph (d) of this section; further, at the end of the marketing 
year, each such manufacturer shall submit a statement of its actual 
countable purchases of eligible tobacco for that marketing year, by 
kind, for burley and flue-cured tobacco. For these purposes, countable 
purchases of eligible tobacco shall be as defined in, and determined 
under, paragraph (b) of this section. If a domestic manufacturer fails 
to file a statement of intentions, the Director shall declare the amount 
which will be considered that manufacturer's intentions for the 
marketing year. That declaration by the Director shall be based on the 
domestic manufacturer's previous reports, or such other information as 
is deemed appropriate by the Director in the Director's discretion. 
Notice of the amount so declared shall be forwarded to the domestic 
manufacturer. If the domestic manufacturer fails to file a year-end 
report or files an inaccurate or incomplete report, then the Director 
may deem that the manufacturer has no purchases to report or take such 
other action as the Director believes is appropriate to fulfill the 
goals of this section. Intentions and purchases of countable tobacco 
will be compared for purposes of determining whether a penalty is due 
from the domestic manufacturer.
    (b) Eligible tobacco for statements of intentions and countable 
purchases toward those intentions. For reports and determinations under 
this section, eligible tobacco for purposes of determining the countable 
purchases under paragraph (a) of this section will be unmanufactured 
domestic tobacco of the relevant kind for use to manufacture, for 
domestic or foreign consumption, cigarettes, semi-processed bulk smoking 
tobacco and other tobacco products. Eligible tobacco for these purposes 
does not include tobacco purchased for export as leaf tobacco, stems, 
trimmings, or scrap. Countable purchases of eligible tobacco shall 
include purchases of eligible tobacco made by domestic manufacturers 
directly from the producers, from a regular auction market, or from the 
price support loan inventory, and shall also include purchases by the 
manufacturer where the manufacturer purchases or acquires the tobacco 
from dealers or buyers who purchased the tobacco for the domestic 
manufacturer during the relevant marketing year directly from a 
producer, at a regular auction market, or from the price support loan 
inventory.
    (c) Weight basis and nature of reports. The weight basis used for 
all reports and comparisons shall be a farm sales weight basis unless 
the Director permits otherwise and all reports will be considered to 
have been made on that basis unless the report clearly states

[[Page 184]]

otherwise. Submitted reports shall be assumed to cover countable 
purchases of eligible tobacco only, absent indications to the contrary.
    (d) Due dates and addresses for reports. For flue-cured tobacco, the 
domestic manufacturer's statement of intentions shall be submitted by 
December 1 before the marketing year and the year-end report shall be 
submitted by August 20 following the end of the marketing year. Those 
respective dates for burley tobacco shall be January 15 before the 
burley tobacco marketing year and November 20 after the burley tobacco 
marketing year. Reports shall be mailed or delivered to the Director, 
Tobacco and Peanuts Division, STOP 0514, 1400 Independence Avenue, SW, 
Washington, DC 20250-0514.
    (e) Penalties. A domestic manufacturer shall be liable for a penalty 
equal to twice the purchaser's no-net-cost assessment rate per pound for 
the applicable kind of tobacco for the relevant marketing year, if the 
manufacturer's purchases of either burley or flue-cured tobacco for the 
marketing year do not equal or exceed, as determined by the Director, 90 
percent of their stated purchase intentions for that kind of tobacco for 
the relevant marketing year. The Director shall adjust the domestic 
manufacturer's intentions, however, to the extent, that producers have 
not produced the full amount of the national quota for the relevant 
marketing year for the particular kind of tobacco. The burden of 
establishing all purchases shall be with the domestic manufacturer and 
the Director may, in the case of indirect purchases for the 
manufacturer, require that the manufacturer obtain verification of the 
purchases by the dealer who made the purchase from the producer, at a 
regular auction market, or from the price support loan inventory, in 
order to assure that the tobacco is, to the manufacturer, a countable 
purchase. The Director may require such additional information as 
determined needed to enforce this subpart.
    (f) Penalty notice and penalty remittance. Penalties will be 
assessed after notice and an opportunity for hearing before the 
Director. Remittances are to be made to the CCC and will be credited to 
the applicable producer loan association's no-net-cost fund or account 
as provided for in part 1464 of this title.
    (g) Maintenance and examination of records. Each domestic 
manufacturer shall keep all relevant records of purchases, by kind, of 
burley and flue-cured tobacco for a period of at least 3 years. The 
Director, Office of Inspector General, or other duly authorized 
representative of the United States may examine such records, receipts, 
computer files, or other information held by a domestic manufacturer 
that may be used to verify or audit such manufacturer's reports. The 
reasonable cost of such examination or audit may be charged to the 
domestic manufacturer who is the subject of the examination or audit. 
All records examined or received under this part by officials of the 
Department of Agriculture shall be kept confidential to the extent 
required by law.

Sec. 752.1  Program objective.

    (a) The regulations in this part set forth the terms and conditions 
for the Water Bank Program. The Secretary is authorized to enter into 
agreements and make payments to eligible persons in important migratory 
waterfowl nesting and breeding areas. Specified wetlands identified for 
the conservation of water or related uses on a conservation plan shall 
be developed in cooperation with the Soil and Water Conservation 
District in which the lands are located.
    (b) The objective of the Water Bank Program (hereinafter referred to 
in this part as the ``program'') is to preserve, restore, and improve 
the wetlands of the Nation, and thereby: (1) Conserve surface waters, 
(2) preserve and improve habitat for migratory waterfowl and other 
wildlife resources, (3) reduce runoff, soil and wind erosion, (4) 
contribute to flood control, (5) contribute to improved water quality 
and reduce stream sedimentation, (6) contribute to improved subsurface 
moisture, (7) reduce acres of new land coming into production and to 
retire lands now in agricultural production, (8) enhance the natural 
beauty of the landscape, and (9) promote comprehensive and total water 
management planning.

Sec. 752.2  Definitions.

    (a) Adjacent land means land on a farm which adjoins designated 
types 1 through 7 wetlands and is considered essential for the 
protection of the wetland or for the nesting, breeding, or feeding of 
migratory waterfowl. Adjacent land need not be contiguous to the land 
designated as wetland, but cannot be located more than one quarter of a 
mile away. Types 1 and 2 wetlands may be designated as adjacent land 
rather than wetland if located not more than one quarter mile from types 
3 through 7 wetlands.
    (b) Administrator means the Administrator or Acting Administrator of 
the

[[Page 200]]

Farm Service Agency (FSA), U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    (c) Agreement means a water bank agreement.
    (d) Conservation plan means a written record of the land user's 
decisions on the use and management of the wetland and adjacent areas 
covered by the agreement. The conservation plan is the basis for the 
agreement. It includes a schedule of conservation treatment and 
management required to improve, protect, or restore the wetland and to 
maintain the wetland and adjacent land as a functional wetland unit for 
the life of the agreement. Conservation treatment and management of the 
vegetation for wetland protection, wildlife habitat, or other authorized 
objectives are consistent with the program objectives and priorities.
    (e) Wetlands means the inland fresh areas described as types 1 
through 7 in Circular 39, Wetlands of the United States, as published by 
the United States Department of the Interior.
    (f) In the regulations in this part and in all instructions, forms, 
and documents in connection therewith, all other words and phrases 
specifically relating to FSA operation shall, unless the context of 
subject matter otherwise requires, have the meanings assigned to them in 
the regulations governing reconstitution of farms, allotments and bases, 
part 719 of this chapter, as amended.

county committees.
    (b) Members of county committees are authorized to approve water 
bank agreements on behalf of the Secretary of Agriculture.
    (c) State and county committees do not have authority to modify or 
waive any of the provisions of these regulations, or any amendment, 
supplement, or revision thereto. They do not have authority to modify or 
waive any of the provisions of any agreement entered into hereunder 
except to the extent specifically authorized in this part.

Sec. 752.5  Eligible farm.

    A farm is eligible for participation in the program if: (a) At the 
time the request for an agreement is filed, land on the farm is not 
covered by a Water Bank Program agreement; (b) the farm contains at 
least one of the types 3 through 7 wetlands which are identified in a 
conservation plan developed in cooperation with the Soil and Water 
Conservation District in which the farm is located; and (c) the farm 
meets the other requirements specified in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 752.6  Land eligible for designation.

    (a) Land placed under an agreement shall be specifically identified 
and designated for the period of the agreement.
    (b) Land eligible for designation must be: (1) Privately owned 
inland fresh wetland areas of types 1 through 7 of which at least 2 
acres must be types 3 through 7 wetlands with respect to which, in the 
absence of inclusion in the program, destruction of the wetland 
character could reasonably be expected; (2) privately owned inland fresh 
wetland areas of types 1 through 7, which are under a drainage easement 
with the U.S. Department of the Interior or with a State government 
which permits agricultural use; or (3) other privately owned land which 
is adjacent to or within one quarter mile of designated types 1 through 
7 wetlands and which is determined by the county committee to be 
essential for the nesting, breeding, or feeding of migratory waterfowl, 
or for the protection of wetland.

[[Page 201]]

    (c) The following land is not eligible for designation: (1) Land on 
which the ownership has changed during the 2-year period preceding the 
first year of the agreement period unless: (i) The new ownership was

eligible land from which he was displaced because of its acquisition by 
any Federal, State, or other agency having the right of eminent domain. 
However a new owner shall not be prohibited from entering into an 
agreement if the person has operated the land to be designated for as 
long as 2 years preceding the first year of the agreement and has 
control of such land for the agreement period. The provisions of this 
subparagraph shall not prohibit the continuation of an agreement by a 
new owner after an agreement has once been entered into under this part.
    (2) Land which is set aside or diverted under any other program 
administered by the Department of Agriculture.
    (3) Land which is owned by the United States or a State or local 
government or political subdivision thereof.

    (5) Types 1 through 7 wetlands which are common to more than one 
farm unless the portion of a wetland area located on the farm which 
controls the potential outlet for drainage is placed under agreement. 
After an agreement has been approved for the farm controlling the outlet 
for drainage, an agreement may be entered into with any or all other 
farms for other portions of the common wetland area if all agreements 
have the same beginning date as the farm controlling the outlet for 
drainage.

wetlands and is specified in the conservation plan for the farm.
    (d) The designated acreage shall not be used: (1) As a source of 
irrigation water or as acreage for a set-aside, land diversion, acreage 
reduction or other program, or (2) to meet the conserving base acreage 
requirement for any other program.
    (e) No crop shall be harvested from the designated acreage and such 
acreage shall not be grazed, except as may be specified in the 
conservation plan for the farm except that the designated acreage may be 
grazed in the first year of the agreement period prior to the date the 
agreement is approved.
    (f) During periods of severe drought, haying of the designated 
acreage may be approved under specified conditions which are prescribed 
by the Deputy Administrator in consultation with the Secretary of

<R05>
Sec. 752.9  Agreement period.

    (a) The agreement period shall be 10 years. The agreement shall 
become effective on January 1 of the year in which the agreement is 
approved except that the agreement shall become effective on January 1 
of the next succeeding year in cases where, at the time the agreement is 
approved, the county committee determines that the agreement signers 
will be unable to comply with the provisions of Sec. 752.7 relating to 
the use of designated acreage in the year in which such agreement is 
approved.
    (b) Subject to a modification of payment rates and such other 
provisions which may be determined to be desirable, agreements may be 
renewed for additional periods of 10 years each.


<R05>
Sec. 752.10  Awarding water bank agreements.

    (a) Persons wishing to be considered for an agreement shall file a 
request with the county committee indicating the acreage which is to be 
designated under the agreement. In order to be eligible for 
participation in the program, such persons must agree to designate: (1) 
2 or more acres of types 3 through 7 wetlands, and (2) a total of at 
least 10 acres consisting of types 1 through 7 wetlands or adjacent 
land, or any combination thereof, identified in a conservation plan 
developed in cooperation with the Soil and Water Conservation District 
in which the farm is located. In addition, the Soil Conservation Service 
(SCS) must certify that the designated acreage constitutes a viable 
wetland unit, contains sufficient adjacent land to protect the wetland, 
and provides essential habitat for the nesting, breeding or feeding of 
migratory waterfowl. An acreage of less than 10 acres may be designated 
if the SCS representative recommends acceptance of the acreage and 
certifies that the area offered for agreement is a good, viable wetland 
unit and that the acceptance of the acreage would be in accord with the 
purposes of the program.
    (b) Persons desiring to participate in the program may agree to 
designate any additional amount to types 1 through 7 wetlands and 
adjacent land. However, the maximum acreage of adjacent land which is 
designated under the agreement with respect to which payment shall be 
based cannot exceed four times the total acreage of types 3 through 7 
wetlands which is designated under the agreement. This maximum acreage 
restriction may be waived by the State committee if such waiver would 
further the program objectives.
    (c) Where funds allocated to the county do not permit accepting all 
requests which are filed, the county committee may limit the approval of 
requests for agreements in accordance with instructions issued by the 
Deputy Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 752.11  Responsibility of agreement signers.

    (a) The owner of the designated acreage is responsible for 
compliance with the agreement and for any refunds or deductions for 
failure to comply fully with the terms of the agreement while a party to 
such agreement.
    (b) Each other person signing the agreement is jointly and severally 
responsible with the owner for compliance with the agreement and for any 
refunds or payment reductions which may be required for failure to 
comply fully with the terms of the agreement while a party to such 
agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 752.12  Provisions relating to tenants and sharecroppers.

    (a) No agreement shall be approved if it appears that the owner, 
landlord, or

[[Page 203]]

operator has (1) not afforded the tenants and sharecroppers having an 
interest in the designated acreage an opportunity to participate in the 
program, or (2) adopted any device or scheme for the purpose of 
depriving any tenant or sharecropper of their payment or any other right 
under the program.
    (b) The agreement shall be deemed to be in noncompliance if any of 
the conditions set forth in paragraph (a) of this section occur after 
the approval of the agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 752.13  Determination of compliance.

    (a) Determination of the acreage designated under the agreement 
shall be made in accordance with part 718 of this chapter, as amended.
    (b) A representative of the county or State committee or any 
authorized representative of the Secretary shall have the right at any 
reasonable time to enter a farm concerning which representations have 
been made on any forms filed under the program in order to measure the 
designated acreage, to examine any records pertaining thereto, and to 
otherwise determine the accuracy of any representations and the 
performance of any obligations by the signatories of a WBP agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 752.14  Annual payments.

    (a) Persons on the farm having an interest in the designated acreage 
shall be eligible for an annual payment.
    (b) The annual per acre payment rates for wetlands and for adjacent 
land shall be those rates which are recommended by the county and State 
committee and approved for each county by the Deputy Administrator. If 
the wetlands are subject to a drainage easement with the United States 
Department of the Interior or a state governmental entity, the payment 
rates for such wetlands will be 80 percent of the approved county rates 
which are applicable to wetlands in the county. A listing of all 
approved rates shall be available for inspection at the county FSA 
office.
    (c) The payment shall be divided among the owner of the designated 
acreage and any other person having an interest in such acreage, 
including tenants and sharecroppers, in the manner agreed upon by them 
as representing their respective contributions to compliance with the 
agreement. The county committee shall refuse to approve an agreement if 
it determines that the proposed division of payment is not fair and 
equitable. The annual payment and the division of the payment shall be 
specified in the agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 752.15  Adjustment of annual rates.

    (a) The county committee shall reexamine the payment rates with 
respect to each agreement at the beginning of the fifth year of any ten-
year initial or renewal period and before the renewal period expires.
    (b) An adjustment in the payment rates shall be made for any initial 
or renewal period taking into consideration the current land rental 
rates and crop values in the area. No adjustment shall be made in a 
payment rate which will result in a reduction of an annual payment rate 
from the rate which is specified in the initial agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 752.16  Refunds or forfeitures for noncompliance.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 
no payment shall be made to any person for any year with respect to any 
agreement for which it is determined that for such year:
    (1) There has been a failure to maintain the wetland character of 
the designated acreage and devote the adjacent land to the use specified 
in the agreement as provided in Sec. 752.7. (a);
    (2) There has been a failure to comply with the prohibition against 
draining, burning, filling, or otherwise using the designated acreage in 
a manner which would destroy the wetland character of the acreage as 
provided in Sec. 752.7 (b);
    (3) There has been a failure to comply with the prohibition against 
using the designated acreage as a dumping area for draining other 
wetlands as provided in Sec. 752.7 (c);
    (4) There has been a failure to comply with the prohibition against 
using the designated acreage as a source of irrigation water or as 
acreage for a set-aside, land diversion, acreage reduction or other 
program, or to meet the conserving base acreage requirement for

[[Page 204]]

any other program as provided in Sec. 752.7 (d);
    (5) There has been a failure to comply with the prohibition against 
harvesting a crop from or grazing the designated acreage as provided in 
Sec. 752.7(e);
    (6) There has been a failure to comply with the provisions relating 
to haying the designated acreage during periods of severe drought as 
provided in Sec. 752.7(f);
    (7) There has been a failure to comply with the provisions relating 
to the harvesting of timber products as provided in Sec. 752.7(g); or
    (8) There has been a failure to comply with the provisions relating 
to tenants and sharecroppers as provided in Sec. 752.12.
    (b) The regulations governing the making of payments when there has 
been a failure to comply fully with the provisions of the program, part 
791 of this chapter, are applicable to the WBP.
    (c) The agreement shall be terminated in any case in which the 
failure to comply with the provisions of this part requires a refund or 
forfeiture of the entire annual payment under the agreement for the year 
and it is determined that the failure to comply is of such a nature as 
to warrant termination of the agreement. If an agreement is terminated, 
the persons signing the agreement shall forfeit all rights to further 
payments under the agreement and shall refund all payments received 
under the agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 752.17  Actions defeating purposes of program.

    If the county committee with the concurrence of the State committee, 
or the State committee, finds that any person has taken any action which 
tends to defeat the purposes of the program, all or any part of the 
annual payment which otherwise would be due under the program may be 
withheld or be required to be refunded.


<R05>
Sec. 752.18  Filing of false claims.

    The making of a fraudulent representation by a person in the payment 
documents or otherwise for the purpose of obtaining a payment from the 
county committee shall render the person liable, in addition to any 
liability under applicable Federal criminal and civil fraud statutes, 
for a refund of any payments received by such person as the result of 
the fraudulent representation.


<R05>
Sec. 752.19  Depriving others of payments.

    If the State committee finds that any person has employed any scheme 
or device (including coercion, fraud, or misrepresentation) which 
deprives any other person of a payment to which such person is otherwise 
entitled under the program, the State committee may withhold or require 
a refund of all or any part of the program payment which otherwise would 
be due to the person who employed such scheme or device.


<R05>
Sec. 752.20  Modification of an agreement.

    (a) Any reconstitution of farms shall be made in accordance with the 
regulations governing reconstitution of farms, part 719 of this chapter, 
as amended.
    (b) If the farm is reconstituted because of purchase, sale, change 
of operation, or otherwise, the agreement shall be modified in 
accordance with instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator with 
respect to any reconstituted farm which contains all or any part of the 
original designated acreage. The modified agreement or agreements shall 
reflect the changes in the number of acres in any reconstituted farm, 
the designated acreage, interested persons, and division of payments. If 
persons who were not signatories to the original agreement are required 
to execute such modified agreement or agreements in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 752.8, but such persons are not willing to become 
parties to the modified agreement or for any other reason a modified 
agreement is not executed, the agreement shall be terminated with 
respect to the designated acreage which is not continued in the program, 
and all unearned payments shall be forfeited or refunded to FSA. The 
annual payment for the year in which a reconstitution occurs shall not 
be considered earned unless the designated acreage is continued in the 
program and there is a compliance with the agreement for the full 
agreement year. The persons on the farm prior to the reconstitution who 
were signatories to the agreement

[[Page 205]]

shall be jointly and severally responsible for refunding the unearned 
payments previously made.
    (c) Except with respect to a farm which is reconstituted, if the 
ownership or operation of the farm changes in such a manner that the 
agreement no longer contains the signatures of persons required to sign 
the agreement in accordance with Sec. 752.8, the agreement shall be 
modified in accordance with instructions issued by the Deputy 
Administrator to reflect the new interested persons and new divisions of 
payments. If such persons are not willing to become parties to the 
modified agreement or for any other reason a modified agreement is not 
executed, the agreement shall be terminated and all unearned payments 
shall be forfeited or refunded. The annual payment for the year in which 
the change of ownership or operation occurs shall not be considered to 
have been earned unless the designated acreage is continued in the 
program and there is compliance with the agreement for the full 
agreement year. The persons on the farm prior to the change of ownership 
or operation who were signatories to the agreement shall be jointly and 
severally responsible for refunding the unearned payments previously 
made.
    (d) The Deputy Administrator may authorize other agreement 
modifications which are determined to be desirable to carry out the 
purposes of the program or to facilitate its administration.


<R05>
Sec. 752.21  Termination of agreements.

    The Deputy Administrator may, by mutual agreement with the parties 
to the agreement, consent to the termination of an agreement where: (a) 
The operator of the farm is physically handicapped and could not 
reasonably be expected to comply with the terms and conditions of the 
agreement; (b) the operator is or was mentally unstable at the time of 
the signing of the agreement and could not reasonably be expected to 
comply with the terms and conditions of the agreement; (c) the parties 
to the agreement are unable to comply with the terms of the agreement as 
the result of conditions beyond their control; (d) compliance with the 
terms of the agreement would work a severe hardship on the parties to 
the agreement; or (e) termination of the agreement would be in the 
public interest. If an agreement is terminated in accordance with the 
provisions of this section, the annual payment for the year in which the 
agreement is terminated shall not be considered to have been earned 
unless there is compliance with the terms and conditions of the 
agreement for the entire calendar year.


<R05>
Sec. 752.22  Transfer of interest in an agreement.

    (a) If a person acquires an interest in the designated acreage 
during the period covered by an agreement, such person may, with the 
consent of the other parties to the agreement and with approval of the 
county committee, become a party to the agreement and share in payments 
thereunder. A person, by becoming a party to the agreement, shall be 
jointly and severally responsible with the other signatories to the 
agreement for compliance with the terms and conditions of the agreement. 
In addition, such person shall be liable for any payment reductions or 
refunds which may be required as the result of the failure to comply 
with the terms and conditions of such agreement after becoming a party 
to the agreement.
    (b) If a signatory to an agreement ceases to have an interest in the 
designated acreage, such person thereby ceases to be a party to the 
agreement. However, such person will not be relieved of any liability 
for deductions and refunds for failure to comply with the terms and 
conditions of the agreement while a party to the agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 752.23  Successors-in-interest.

    In case of death, incompetency, or disappearance of any person, any

Sec. 752.24  Agreement not in comformity with regulations.

    If, after an agreement is approved by the county committee, it is 
discovered

[[Page 206]]

that such agreement is not in conformity with the regulations as the 
result of a misunderstanding of the program procedures by a signatory to 
the agreement, a modification of the agreement may be made by mutual 
agreement. If persons who are currently eligible to execute the 
corrected agreement are unwilling to do so, the agreement shall be 
terminated and all payments paid or payable under the agreement shall be 
forfeited or refunded, except as may be allowed by the Deputy 
Administrator in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 752.25.


<R05>
Sec. 752.25  Performance based upon advice or action of county or State committee.

<R05>
Sec. 755.2  Purposes and objectives.

    The general purposes and objectives of the Appalachian Land 
Stabilization and Conservation Program are to promote economic growth of 
the Region and to promote the conservation and development of the 
Region's soil and water resources. This program is a long-term program 
designed to carry out the policy of the Act by assisting landowners, 
operators, or occupiers through contracts providing for land 
stabilization, erosion and sediment control, reclamation through changes 
in land use, and the establishment of practices and measures for the 
conservation and development of the Region's soil, water, woodland, 
wildlife, and recreation resources.


<R05>
Sec. 755.3  Geographical applicability.

    The Appalachian Land Stabilization and Conservation Program will be 
limited to the States and counties designated as part of the Appalachian 
Region as defined in Sec. 755.1 of the regulations of this part, and 
then only in counties or areas specifically approved in the State 
program developed hereunder.


<R05>
Sec. 755.4  General.

    (a) The Appalachian Land Stabilization and Conservation Program will 
be administered in the field by State and county committees under the 
general direction and supervision of the Administrator. Members of 
county committees are hereby authorized to sign contracts on behalf of 
the Secretary. State and county committees do not have authority to 
modify or waive any of the provisions of these regulations, or any 
amendment, supplement, or revision thereto.
    (b) Landowners, operators, and occupiers desiring to share in the 
accomplishment of the purposes and objectives of the program will be 
given an

[[Page 209]]

opportunity to participate in the program in accordance with the 
provisions of the program as set forth in this subpart. An applicant, as 
a part of his application for assistance, will file an acceptable 
conservation and development plan for the acreage to be included in his 
contract, and the measures specified in the plan must be carried out 
irrespective of whether cost-sharing is offered. The county committee 
will determine the practices and extent of such practices to be approved 
for cost-sharing to assist the applicant in carrying out his acceptable 
plan. A contract shall be entered into setting forth the extent of the 
approved assistance. An acceptable conservation and development plan 
will be a plan developed for the land proposed to be placed under 
contract, on a form prescribed by the Administrator, with technical 
planning assistance by technicians of the Soil Conservation Service, 
except in cases where the proposed treatment involves only a single 
practice of pasture renovation or timber stand improvement or conversion 
of less than 10 acres of land to grass or trees and such use does not 
involve critical areas or unusual costs and the conservation and 
development plan is acceptable to the county committee. In approving 
contracts, the county committees shall give preference to needy 
landowners, operators, and occupiers to the extent that such preference 
is consistent with the development of land treatment programs in the 
project area.
    (c) Detailed information concerning the program as it applies to an 
individual farm may be obtained from the county FSA office for the 
county in which the farm is located or from the State FSA office.

1968]


<R05>
Sec. 755.5  State programs.

    (a) The State program shall be developed by the State or a political 
subdivision thereof in accordance with the regulations contained in this 
subpart. The Farm Service Agency and other applicable agencies of the 
Department of Agriculture shall cooperate with the State governmental 
officials in the development of the program. The chairman of the State 
committee as the chairman of the State Agricultural Conservation Program 
Development Group shall be the point of contact with the State 
governmental officials. The State Agricultural Conservation Program 
Development Group, which consists of the State ASC Committee (including 
the State Director of Extension), the State conservationist of the Soil 
Conservation Service, and the Forest Service official having 
jurisdiction over farm forestry in the State, shall consult with 
organizations and agencies within the State that have conservation 
interests and responsibilities. Upon request of the Governor of the 
State, a person selected as a direct representative of the Governor may 
be designated by the Secretary as an additional member of the ACP 
Development Group with equal authority with other members of the Group 
in the development of the State program.
    (b) The State program shall include the following provisions: (1) 
Identification of program objectives and areas in the State where the 
program will be applicable; (2) the designation of practices for which 
cost-share assistance is requested for each designated area, including 
specifications for each proposed practice; and (3) the proposed cost-
share rates for each practice.
    (c) Minimum specifications which practices must meet to be eligible 
for Federal cost-sharing shall be set forth in the State program, or be 
incorporated therein by specific reference to a standard publication or 
other written document containing such specifications. For practices 
involving the establishment or improvement of vegetative cover, the 
specifications shall include, where appropriate, liming fertilization, 
and seeding rates, eligible seeds and mixtures, seeding dates, 
requirements for cultural operations and inoculation, and other steps 
essential to the successful establishment or improvement of the 
vegetative cover. For mechanical or construction type practices, the 
specifications shall include, where appropriate, the types and sizes of 
material, installation or construction requirements, and other steps 
essential to the proper functioning of the structure. For other 
practices, the specifications shall include those steps essential to the 
successful performance

[[Page 210]]

of the practice. Practice specifications may provide minimum performance 
requirements which will qualify the practice for cost-sharing and 
maximum limits of performance which will be eligible for cost-sharing. 
For practices which authorize Federal cost-sharing for applications of 
liming materials and commercial fertilizers, the minimum applications 
and maximum applications on which cost-sharing is authorized shall be 
determined on the basis of a current soil test: Provided, however, That 
if available facilities are not adequate to permit the desired use of 
soil tests under the program, an alternative basis for determination by 
the county committee of such application shall be authorized to the 
extent necessary.
    (d) The following practices and uses are authorized:
    (1) Establishment of permanent sod waterways to dispose of excess 
water without causing erosion.
    (2) Establishment of a permanent vegetative cover for soil 
protection or as a needed land use adjustment.

dams, pits, or ponds to prevent or heal gullying or to retard or reduce 
runoff of water.
    (6) Constructing channel lining, chutes, drop spillways, pipe drops, 
drop inlets, or similar structures for the protection of outlets and 
water channels that dispose of excess water.
    (7) Streambank or shore protection, channel clearance, enlargement 
or realinement, or construction of floodways, levees, or dikes, to 
prevent erosion or flood damage to farmland.
    (8) Establishment of a stand of trees or shrubs to prevent erosion.
    (9) Establishment of a stand of forest trees or shrubs on farmland 
for purposes other than the prevention of erosion.
    (10) Improvement of a stand of forest trees.
    (11) Establishment of contour strip-cropping to protect soil from 
erosion.
    (12) Constructing or sealing dams, pits, or ponds as a means of 
protecting vegetative cover or to make practicable the utilization of 
the land for vegetative cover.
    (13) Developing springs or seeps for livestock water as a means of 
protecting vegetative cover or to make practicable the utilization of 
the land for vegetative cover.
    (14) Controlling competitive shrubs to permit growth of adequate 
desirable vegetative cover.
    (15) Improvement of an established vegetative cover for soil or 
watershed protection.
    (16) Treatment of farmland to permit the use of legumes and grasses

area; establishment of fishing area; establishment of summer water 
sports area; establishment of winter sports area.
    (20) Other practices not covered above which are determined to be 
needed to accomplish the purpose of the program.
    (e) The Soil Conservation Service shall have the same technical 
responsibility for Appalachian Land Stabilization and Conservation 
Program practices as it has for the same or similar Agricultural 
Conservation Program Practices including applicable components of 
approved recreation practices. The Forest Service is responsible for the 
technical phases of forestry practices.
    (f) Each proposed State program shall be submitted to the Commission 
by the member thereof representing such State. The estimated amount of 
funds needed to accomplish the objectives of such program shall be 
stated in the submission of the proposed program to the Commission. If 
approved by the Commission, the proposed State

[[Page 211]]

program shall be submitted to the Secretary by the Federal Cochairman. 
Responsibility is assigned to the Farmer Programs Division, FSA for 
review and recommendation for approval or disapproval by the Secretary.
    (g) Copies of bulletins setting forth the State program as approved 
by the Secretary shall be available in the office of the county 
committee.

<R05>
Sec. 755.6  Cost-share contract.

    (a) Filing requests. (1) Landowners, operators, or occupiers in 
eligible counties shall be furnished information with respect to the 
program and afforded an opportunity to request a cost-share contract 
covering those practices which would accomplish the objectives of the 
program on the farm.
    (2) The request shall be on a form and in accordance with 
instructions prescribed by the Administrator.
    (b) Entering into a contract. (1) The county committee is authorized 
to approve the contract on behalf of the Secretary.
    (2) The contract must be signed by the owner of the land on which 
cost-share payments are provided under the contract and by the operator 
of the farm. The contract shall also be signed by any occupiers who will 
share in payments in one or more years of the contract period.
    (3) There shall be only one contract for a farm.
    (4) The final date for signing the contract shall be the date 
announced by the Administrator.

the approval of the contract and shall end on December 31 of such year. 
Each subsequent year of the contract period shall be on a calendar year 
basis.


<R05>
Sec. 755.7  Cost-share payments.

    (a) Subject to the conditions and limitations in this subpart, cost-
sharing may be authorized for practices needed during the period of the 
contract to conserve and develop soil, water, woodland, wildlife, and 
recreation resources. Payment of the cost-shares shall be made only upon 
application submitted on a form prescribed by the Administrator. 
Practices required to be established under the contract which are 
started after a request for a contract is filed shall be considered as 
started during the contract period.
    (b) Cost-share rates shall not exceed 80 per centum of the average 
cost of carrying out the land treatment measures or such lower rate as 
the county committee determines will accomplish the objectives of the 
program. As a further limitation, cost-sharing may not be authorized in 
excess of a total amount computed by multiplying the number of acres 
designated under contract times $50, unless a representative of the 
State committee approves an amount in excess of this limitation on the 
basis that the income potential and benefits derived from expenditures 
of the additional money warrant the higher limit.
    (c) Cost-sharing shall not be approved for more than 50 acres per 
farm.
    (d) The total acreage with respect to which any landowner, operator, 
or occupier receives cost-sharing payments shall not exceed 50 acres

    (e) Cost-sharing for the practices or components thereof contained 
in the approved State program is conditioned upon the establishment, 
maintenance, and performance of the practices in accordance with all 
applicable specifications and program provisions. The county committee 
shall specify on the practice approval the date by which the practice 
must be completed. Subject to the availability of funds, cost-sharing 
may be authorized for the restoration or replacement of any needed 
conservation measure if during the contract period the original 
conservation use is destroyed or rendered unsuitable through no fault of 
the contract signers.
    (f) In addition to the provisions contained in this subpart, cost-
sharing payments shall also be subject to the following regulations of 
the Agricultural Conservation Program (7 CFR 701.1-701.93, as amended):

    (g) Cost-share payments shall not be made under the program with 
respect to land owned by the Federal Government, a State, or a political 
subdivision thereof.

[30 FR 8669, July 9, 1965, as amended by Amdt. 1, 30 FR 9758, Aug. 5, 
1965; Amdt. 4, 33 FR 16141, Nov. 5, 1968]


<R05>
Sec. 755.8  Modification of contract.

    (a) If the farm is reconstituted in accordance with the regulations 
governing Reconstitution of Farms, Allotments, and Bases, part 719 of 
this chapter, as amended, or if there is any change in the land covered 
by a contract entered into pursuant to Sec. 755.20, because of purchase, 
sale, change of operation, or otherwise, the contract shall be modified. 
Such modified contract or contracts shall reflect the changes in the 
number of acres in any resulting farm, the acreage covered by the 
contract, interested persons, and practices called for under the 
original contract. If persons who were not signatories to the original 
contract are eligible and required to sign such modified contract or 
contracts but are not willing to become parties to the modified contract 
or for any other reason a modified contract is not entered into, cost-
share payments for practices which have not been carried out shall be 
forfeited with respect to acreage not continued in the program. In 
addition, with respect to acreage not continued in the program, cost-
share payments paid for practices (or components thereof) which have 
been carried out shall be refunded by the owner of such acreage prior to 
reconstitution unless the county committee with the approval of the 
State committee determines that the failure to carry out all of the 
practices called for by the original contract will not impair the 
practices which have been carried out and the completed practices will 
provide conservation benefits consistent with the cost-shares which have 
been paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if control of land was lost 
through eminent domain proceedings or to an agency having the right of 
eminent domain, any cost-share payments paid under the contract with 
respect to such land are not required to be refunded.
    (b) Except in cases covered by paragraph (a) of this section, if the 
ownership or operation of the farm or the land covered by the contract 
changes in such a manner that the contract no longer contains the 
signatures of persons required to sign the contract as provided in 
Sec. 755.6, the contract shall be modified to reflect the new interested 
persons. If such persons are not willing to become parties to the 
modified contract, or for any other reason a modified contract is not 
entered into, cost-share payments shall be forfeited and refunded in 
accordance with the rules in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Upon request of the contract signers and approval of the county 
committee, a contract may be modified to change or add practices, or to 
make other changes which are consistent with this subpart, the State 
program, and the conservation and development plan.
    (d) Upon request of the contract signers, a contract which would 
otherwise be in a noncompliance status at the end of the contract period 
under the provisions of Sec. 755.10(a) of these regulations may be 
modified to extend the contract period not to exceed a total period of 
10 years if the county committee determines that failure to establish 
the practices specified in the contract was not the result of the fault 
or negligence of the contract signers.

<R05>
Sec. 755.9  Termination of contracts.

    The Deputy Administrator may consent to the termination of a 
contract in cases where the parties to the contract are unable to comply 
with the terms of the contract due to conditions beyond their control, 
in cases where compliance with the terms of the contract would work a 
severe hardship on the parties to the contract, or in cases where 
termination of the contract would be in the public interest, provided 
the parties to the contract refund such part of the cost-share payments 
made under the contract as the Deputy Administrator determines 
appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 755.10  Noncompliance.

    (a) Failure to establish the practices specified in the contract 
within the time specified by the county committee shall be a violation 
of the contract and all payments under the contract shall be forfeited 
and refunded.
    (b) Failure to maintain a practice for the contract period or the 
normal lifespan of the practice, whichever is shorter, in accordance 
with good farming practices shall be a violation of the contract and any 
payment made in connection with such practice shall be refunded unless 
the practice is restored within the time prescribed by the county 
committee. The normal lifespan of a practice shall be determined by the 
county committee.
    (c) If the county committee finds that any person has adopted or 
participated in any practice which tends to defeat the purposes of the 
program, it may withhold, or require to be refunded, all or any part of 
cost-share payments paid or payable under the program. It shall be 
considered a practice defeating the purposes of the program if the 
contract signers do not make available for public use a recreation 
resource development for which costs are shared. The regulations 
governing nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs of the 
Department of Agriculture, part 15 of this title, shall be applicable to 
this program.

<R05>
Sec. 755.11  Signatures.

    Signatures to contracts and related forms shall be in conformity 
with the instructions on signatures and authorizations applicable to the 
Agricultural Conservation Program.


<R05>
Sec. 755.12  Filing of false claims.

    The making of a fraudulent representation by a person in the payment 
documents or otherwise for the purpose of obtaining a payment from the 
county committee shall render the person liable, aside from any 
additional liability under criminal and civil frauds statutes, for a 
refund of the payments received by him with respect to which the 
fraudulent representation was made.


<R05>
Sec. 755.13  Delegation of authority.

    No delegation in this subpart to a State or county committee shall 
preclude the Administrator, or his designee, from determining any 
question arising under the program or reversing or modifying any 
determinations made by a State or county committee.


<R05>
Sec. 755.14  Reporting performance.

    The Operator of the farm, in accordance with instructions issued by 
the Deputy Administrator, shall report to the county committee on Form 
ACP-245 the extent of compliance with the terms of the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 755.15  Handling exceptional cases.

    The Deputy Administrator may allow payment for performance not 
meeting all program requirements, where not prohibited by statute, if in 
his judgment such action is needed to permit a proper disposition of the 
case. Such action may be taken only where the person acted in good faith 
and in reasonable reliance on any instruction or commitment of any 
member, or employee of the State or county committee or representatives 
of other Federal agencies assigned responsibility under the program, in 
meeting his obligations under the contract and in so doing reasonably 
accomplished the purposes of the contract. The amount of the payment 
shall be based on the actual performance and shall not exceed the amount 
to which the person

[[Page 214]]

would have been entitled if the performance rendered had met all

information necessary to make a determination as to whether other legal 
recourse is available to the farmer. However, notwithstanding such a 
determination, the Deputy Administrator may reopen the case at a later 
date and make a new determination on the merits of the case as may be 
just and equitable.
    (b) In the event that a farmer receives an indemnity payment under 
this subpart, and such farmer is later compensated for the same loss by 
the person (or the representative or successor in interest of such 
person) responsible for such loss, the indemnity payment shall be 
refunded by the farmer to the Department of Agriculture: Provided, That 
the amount of such refund shall not exceed the amount of other 
compensation received by the farmer.

Secs. 762.1-762.100  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 762.101  Introduction.

    (a) Scope. This subpart contains regulations governing Operating 
Loans and Farm Ownership loans guaranteed by the Farm Service Agency. 
This subpart applies to lenders, holders, borrowers, Agency personnel, 
and other parties involved in making, guaranteeing, holding, servicing, 
or liquidating such loans.

[[Page 228]]

    (b) Policy. The Agency issues guarantees on loans made to qualified 
loan applicants without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national 
origin, marital status, or age, provided the loan applicant can enter 
into a legal and binding contract, or whether all or part of the 
applicant's income derives from any public assistance program or whether 
the applicant, in good faith, exercises any rights under the Consumer 
Protection Act.
    (c) Lender list and classification. (1) The Agency maintains a 
current list of lenders who express a desire to participate in the 
guaranteed loan program. This list is made available to farmers upon 
request.
    (2) Lenders who participate in the Agency guaranteed loan program 
will be classified into one of the following categories:
    (i) Standard Eligible Lender under Sec. 762.105,
    (ii) Certified Lender, or
    (iii) Preferred Lender under Sec. 762.106.
    (3) Lenders may continue to make loans under Approved Lender Program 
(ALP) agreements until they expire; however, these agreements will not 
be renewed when they expire. All ALP agreements with farm credit 
institutions will expire on February 12, 2001.
    (d) Type of guarantee. Guarantees are available for both a loan note 
or a line of credit. A loan note is used for a loan of fixed amount and 
term. A line of credit has a fixed term, but no fixed amount. The 
principal amount outstanding at any time, however, may not exceed the 
line of credit ceiling contained in the contract. Both guarantees are 
evidenced by the same loan guarantee form.
    (e) Termination of loan guarantee. The loan guarantee will

the Agency office for cancellation within 30 days of the date of the 
notice by the lender.

    Additional security. Collateral in excess of that needed to fully 
secure the loan.
    Agency. The Farm Service Agency, including its employees and state 
and area committee members, and any successor agency.
    Allonge. An attachment or an addendum to a note.
    Applicant. For guaranteed loans, the lender requesting a guarantee 
is the applicant. The party applying to the lender for a loan will be 
considered the loan applicant.
    Aquaculture. The husbandry of aquatic organisms in a controlled or 
selected environment. An aquatic organism is any fish, amphibian, 
reptile, or aquatic plant. An aquaculture operation is considered to be 
a farm only if it is conducted on the grounds which the loan applicant 
owns, leases, or has an exclusive right to use. An exclusive right to 
use must be evidenced by a permit issued to the loan applicant and the 
permit must specifically identify the waters available to be used by the 
loan applicant only.
    Assignment of guaranteed portion. A process by which the lender 
transfers

[[Page 229]]

the right to receive payments or income on the guaranteed loan to 
another party, usually in return for payment in the amount of the loan's 
guaranteed principal. The lender retains the unguaranteed portion in its 
portfolio and receives a fee from the purchaser or assignee to service 
the loan, and receive and remit payments according to a written 
assignment agreement. This assignment can be reassigned or sold multiple 
times.
    Average farm customers. Those conventional farm borrowers who are 
required to pledge their crops, livestock, and other chattel and real 
estate security for the loan. This does not include those high-risk 
farmers with limited security and management ability who are generally 
charged a higher interest rate by conventional agricultural lenders. 
Also, this does not include those low-risk farm customers who obtain 
financing on a secured or unsecured basis, who have as collateral such 
items as savings accounts, time deposits, certificates of deposit, 
stocks and bonds, and life insurance, which they are able to pledge for 
the loan.
    Basic Security. All farm machinery, equipment, vehicles, foundation 
and breeding livestock herds and flocks, including replacements, and 
real estate which serves as security for a loan guaranteed by the 
Agency.
    Beginning farmer or rancher. A beginning farmer or rancher is an 
individual or entity who:
    (1) Meets the loan eligibility requirements for OL or FO assistance, 
as applicable, in accordance with this subpart;
    (2) Has not operated a farm or ranch, or who has operated a farm or 
ranch for not more than 10 years. This requirement applies to all 
members of an entity;
    (3) Will materially and substantially participate in the operation 
of the farm or ranch:
    (i) In the case of a loan made to an individual, individually or 
with the immediate family, material and substantial participation 
requires that the individual provide substantial day-to-day labor and 
management of the farm or ranch, consistent with the practices in the 
county or State where the farm is located.
    (ii) In the case of a loan made to an entity, all members must 
materially and substantially participate in the operation of the farm or 
ranch. Material and substantial participation requires that the 
individual provide some amount of the management, or labor and 
management necessary for day-to-day activities, such that if the 
individual did not provide these inputs, operation of the farm or ranch 
would be seriously impaired;
    (4) Agrees to participate in any loan assessment and financial 
management programs required by Agency regulations;
    (5) Does not own real farm or ranch property or who, directly or 
through interests in family farm entities owns real farm or ranch 
property, the aggregate acreage of which does not exceed 25 percent of 
the average farm or ranch acreage of the farms or ranches in the county 
where the property is located. If the farm is located in more than one 
county, the average farm acreage of the county where the loan 
applicant's residence is located will be used in the calculation. If the 
applicant's residence is not located on the farm or if the loan 
applicant is an entity, the average farm acreage of the county where the 
major portion of the farm is located will be used. The average county 
farm or ranch acreage will be determined from the most recent Census of 
Agriculture developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the 
Census or USDA;
    (6) Demonstrates that the available resources of the loan applicant 
and spouse (if any) are not sufficient to enable the loan applicant to 
enter or continue farming or ranching on a viable scale; and

(including all farm income, nonfarm income and all loan advances) and 
all cash outflows (including all farm and nonfarm debt service and other 
expenses) to be incurred by the borrower during the period of the 
budget. Cash flow budgets for loans under $50,000 do not require income 
and expenses itemized by categories. A cash flow budget may be completed 
either for a 12 month period, a typical production cycle or the life of 
the loan, as appropriate. It may also be prepared with a breakdown of 
cash inflows and outflows for each month of the review period and 
includes the expected outstanding operating credit balance for the end 
of each month. The latter type is referred to as a ``monthly cash flow 
budget''.

residence which, although physically separate from the farm acreage, is 
ordinarily treated as part of the farm in the local community.
    Feasible plan. A plan is feasible when a borrower or applicant's 
cash flow budget indicates that there is sufficient cash inflow to pay 
all cash outflow each year during the term of the loan. If a loan 
approval or restructuring action exceeds one production cycle and the 
planned cash flow budget is atypical due to cash or inventory on hand, 
new enterprises, carryover debt, atypical planned purchases, important 
operating changes, or other reasons, a cash flow budget must be prepared 
that reflects a typical cycle. If the request is for only one cycle, a 
feasible plan for only one cycle is required for approval.
    Financially viable operation. An operation which, with Agency 
assistance, is projected to improve its financial condition over a 
period of time to the point that the operator can obtain commercial 
credit without further Agency direct or guaranteed assistance. A 
borrower that will meet the Agency classification of ``commercial,'' as 
defined in Agency Instruction 2006-W, available in any Agency office, 
will be considered to be financially viable. Such an operation must 
generate sufficient income to:
    (1) Meet annual operating expenses and debt payments as they become 
due;
    (2) Meet basic family living expenses to the extent they are not met 
by dependable nonfarm income;

submitting loan guarantee requests. They may reapply for CLP or PLP 
status when the problem causing them to lose their status has been 
resolved.

    Loan applicants must meet all of the following requirements to be 
eligible for a guaranteed OL or a guaranteed FO:
    (a) Agency loss. The loan applicant, and anyone who will execute the 
promissory note, have not caused the Agency a loss by receiving debt 
forgiveness on more than three occasions on or prior to April 4, 1996, 
or on any occasion after April 4, 1996, on all or a portion of any 
direct or guaranteed loan made under the authority of the CONACT by debt 
write-down, write-off, compromise under the provisions of section 331 of 
the CONACT, adjustment, reduction, charge-off, or discharge in 
bankruptcy or through any payment of a guaranteed loss claim under the 
same circumstances. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, applicants 
who receive a write-down under section 353 of the CONACT, or are current 
on payments under a confirmed bankruptcy reorganization plan, may 
receive direct and guaranteed OL loans to pay annual farm and ranch 
operating expenses, which include family subsistence, if the applicant 
meets all other requirements for the loan.
    (b) Delinquent Federal debt. The loan applicant, and anyone who will 
execute the promissory note, is not delinquent on any Federal debt, 
other than a debt under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. (Any debt

execute the promissory note, have no outstanding unpaid judgment 
obtained by the United States in any court. Such judgments do not 
include those filed as a result of action in the United States Tax

all entity members must have acceptable credit history demonstrated by 
debt repayment.
    (2) A history of failures to repay past debts as they came due when 
the ability to repay was within their control will demonstrate 
unacceptable credit history.
    (3) Unacceptable credit history will not include:
    (i) Isolated instances of late payments which do not represent a 
pattern and were clearly beyond their control; or,
    (ii) Lack of credit history.

Applicants must certify on the application that it and its members, if 
an entity, have not been convicted of such a crime within the relevant 
period. If the lender uses the lender's Agency approved forms, the 
certification may be an attachment to the form.

    (c) Highly erodible land or wetlands conservation. Loans may not be

erodible land or to the conversion of wetlands to produce an 
agricultural commodity. A decision by the Agency to reject an 
application for this reason may be appealable. An appeal questioning 
whether the presence of a wetland, converted wetland, or highly erodible 
land on a particular property must be filed directly with the USDA 
agency making the determination in accordance with the agency's appeal

<R05>
Sec. 762.122  Loan limitations.

    (a) OL term limitations. (1) No guaranteed OL shall be made to any 
loan applicant after the 15th year that a loan applicant, or any 
individual signing the promissory note, received a direct or guaranteed 
OL.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if a borrower 
had any combination of direct or guaranteed OL closed in 10 or more 
prior calendar years prior to October 28, 1992, eligibility to receive 
new guaranteed OL is extended for 5 additional years from October 28, 
1992, and the years need not run consecutively. However, in the case of 
a line of credit, each year in which an advance is made after October 
28, 1992, counts toward the 5 additional years. Once determined 
eligible, a loan or line of credit may be approved for any authorized 
term.
    (b) Leased land. When FO funds are used for improvements to leased 
land the terms of the lease must provide

[[Page 242]]

unexhausted value of the improvement if the lease is terminated.
    (c) Tax-exempt transactions. The Agency will not guarantee any loan 
made with the proceeds of any obligation the interest on which is 
excluded from income under section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of

not be used to purchase the guaranteed portion of any Agency guaranteed 
loan. An Agency guaranteed loan may not serve as collateral for a tax-
exempt bond issue.

to purchase, build, or expand buildings located in a special 100 year 
floodplain as defined by FEMA flood hazard area maps unless flood 
insurance is available and purchased.

<R05>
Sec. 762.123  Insurance and farm inspection requirements.

    (a) Insurance. (1) Lenders must require borrowers to maintain 
adequate property, public liability, and crop insurance to protect the 
lender and Government's interests.
    (2) By loan closing, loan applicants must either:
    (i) Obtain at least the catastrophic risk protection (CAT) level of 
crop insurance coverage, if available, for each crop of economic 
significance, as defined by part 402 of this title, or
    (ii) Waive eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in 
connection with the uninsured crop. EM loan assistance under part 1945, 
subpart D, of this title is not considered emergency crop loss 
assistance for purposes of this waiver and execution of the waiver does 
not render the borrower ineligible for EM loans.
    (3) Loan applicants must purchase flood insurance if buildings are 
or will be located in a special flood hazard area as defined by FEMA 
flood hazard area maps and if flood insurance is available.
    (4) Insurance, including crop insurance, must be obtained as 
required by the lender or the Agency based on the strengths and 
weaknesses of the loan.
    (b) Farm inspections. Before submitting an application the lender 
must make an inspection of the farm to assess the suitability of the 
farm and to determine any development that is needed to make it a 
suitable farm.


<R05>
Sec. 762.124  Interest rates, terms, charges, and fees.

    (a) Interest rates. (1) The interest rate on a guaranteed loan or 
line of credit may be fixed or variable as agreed upon between the 
borrower and the lender. The lender may charge different rates on the 
guaranteed and the non-guaranteed portions of the note. The guaranteed 
portion may be fixed while the unguaranteed portion may be variable, or 
vice versa. If both portions are variable, different bases may be used.
    (2) If a variable rate is used, it must be tied to a rate 
specifically agreed to between the lender and borrower in the loan 
instruments. Variable rates may change according to the normal practices 
of the lender for its average farm customers, but the frequency of 
change must be specified in the loan or line of credit instrument.
    (3) Neither the interest rate on the guaranteed portion nor the 
unguaranteed portion may exceed the rate the lender charges its average 
agricultural loan customer. At the request of the Agency, the lender 
must provide evidence of the rate charged the average agricultural loan 
customer. This evidence may consist of average yield data, or documented 
administrative differential rate schedule formulas used by the lender.
    (4) Interest must be charged only on the actual amount of funds 
advanced and for the actual time the funds are outstanding. Interest on 
protective advances made by the lender to protect the security will be 
charged at the note rate but limited to paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section.
    (5) The lender and borrower may collectively obtain a temporary 
reduction in the interest rate through the interest assistance program 
in accordance with Sec. 762.150.
    (b) OL terms. (1) Loan funds or advances on a line of credit used to 
pay

[[Page 243]]

annual operating expenses will be repaid when the income from the year's 
operation is received, except when the borrower is establishing a new 
enterprise, developing a farm, purchasing feed while feed crops are 
being established, or recovering from disaster or economic reverses.
    (2) The final maturity date for each loan cannot exceed 7 years from 
the date of the promissory note or line of credit agreement. Advances 
for purposes other than for annual operating expenses will be scheduled 
for repayment over the minimum period necessary considering the loan 
applicant's ability to repay and the useful life of the security, but 
not in excess of 7 years.
    (3) All advances on a line of credit must be made within 5 years 
from the date of the Loan Guarantee.
    (c) FO terms. Each loan must be scheduled for repayment over a 
period not to exceed 40 years from the date of the note or such shorter 
period as may be necessary to assure that the loan will be adequately 
secured, taking into account the probable depreciation of the security.
    (d) Balloon installments under loan note guarantee. Balloon payment 
terms are permitted on FO or OL subject to the following:
    (1) Extended repayment schedules may include equal, unequal, or 
balloon installments if needed on any guaranteed loan to establish a new 
enterprise, develop a farm, or recover from a disaster or an economical 
reversal.
    (2) Loans with balloon installments must have adequate collateral at 
the time the balloon installment comes due. Crops, livestock other than 
breeding livestock, or livestock products produced are not sufficient 
collateral for securing such a loan.
    (3) The borrower must be projected to be able to refinance the 
remaining debt at the time the balloon payment comes due based on the 
expected financial condition of the operation, the depreciated value of 
the collateral, and the principal balance on the loan.
    (e) Charges and Fees. (1) The lender may charge the loan applicant 
and borrower fees for the loan provided they are no greater than those 
charged to unguaranteed customers for similar transactions. Similar 
transactions are those involving the same type of loan requested (for 
example, operating loans or farm real estate loans).
    (2) Late payment charges (including default interest charges) are 
not covered by the guarantee. These charges may not be added to the 
principal and interest due under any guaranteed note or line of credit. 
However, late payment charges may be made outside of the guarantee if 
they are routinely made by the lender in similar types of loan 
transactions.
    (3) Lenders may not charge a loan origination and servicing fee 
greater than 1 percent of the loan amount for the life of the loan when 
a guaranteed loan is made in conjunction with a down payment FO for 
beginning farmers under part 1943, subpart A, of this title.

Sec. 762.125  Financial feasibility.

    (a) General. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
section, PLP lenders will follow their internal procedures on financial 
feasibility as agreed to by the Agency during PLP certification.
    (2) The loan applicant's proposed operation must project a feasible 
plan as defined in Sec. 762.102(b).
    (3) For standard eligible lenders, the projected income and expenses 
of the borrower and operation used to determine a feasible plan must be 
based on the loan applicant's proven record of production and financial 
management.
    (4) For CLP lenders, the projected income and expenses of the 
borrower and the operation must be based on the loan applicant's 
financial history and proven record of financial management.
    (5) For those farmers without a proven history, a combination of any 
actual history and any other reliable source of information that are 
agreeable with the lender, the loan applicant, and the Agency will be 
used.
    (6) The cash flow budget analyzed to determine a feasible plan must 
represent the predicted cash flow of the operating cycle.
    (7) Lenders must use price forecasts that are reasonable and 
defensible. Sources must be documented by the lender and acceptable to 
the Agency.

[[Page 244]]

    (8) When a feasible plan depends on income from other sources in 
addition to income from owned land, the income must be dependable and 
likely to continue.
    (9) The lender will analyze business ventures other than the farm 
operation to determine their soundness and contribution to the 
operation. Guaranteed loan funds will not be used to finance a nonfarm 
enterprise. Nonfarm enterprises include, but are not limited to: raising 
earthworms, exotic birds, tropical fish, dogs, or horses for nonfarm 
purposes; welding shops; boarding horses; and riding stables.
    (10) When the loan applicant has or will have a cash flow budget 
developed in conjunction with a proposed or existing Agency direct loan, 
the two cash flow budgets must be consistent.
    (b) Estimating production. (1) Standard eligible lenders must use 
the best sources of information available for estimating production in 
accordance with this subsection when developing cash flow budgets.
    (2) Deviations from historical performance may be acceptable, if 
specific to changes in operation and adequately justified and acceptable 
to the Agency.
    (3) For existing farmers, actual production for the past 3 years 
will be utilized.
    (4) For those farmers without a proven history, a combination of any 
actual history and any other reliable source of information that are 
agreeable with the lender, the loan applicant, and the Agency will be 
used.
    (5) When the production of a growing commodity can be estimated, it 
must be considered when projecting yields.
    (6) When the loan applicant's production history has been so 
severely affected by a declared disaster that an accurate projection 
cannot be made, the following applies:
    (i) County average yields are used for the disaster year if the loan 
applicant's disaster year yields are less than the county average 
yields. If county average yields are not available, State average yields 
are used. Adjustments can be made, provided there is factual evidence to 
demonstrate that the yield used in the farm plan is the most probable to 
be realized.
    (ii) To calculate a historical yield, the crop year with the lowest 
actual or county average yield may be excluded, provided the loan 
applicant's yields were affected by disasters at least 2 of the previous 
5 consecutive years.
    (c) Refinancing. Loan guarantee requests for refinancing must ensure 
that a reasonable chance for success still exists. The lender must 
demonstrate that problems with the loan applicant's operation that have 
been identified, can be corrected, and the operation returned to a sound 
financial basis.

<R05>
Sec. 762.126  Security requirements.

    (a) General. (1) The lender is responsible for ensuring that proper 
and adequate security is obtained and maintained to fully secure the 
loan, protect the interest of the lender and the Agency, and assure 
repayment of the loan or line of credit.
    (2) The lender will obtain a lien on additional security when 
necessary to protect the Agency's interest.
    (b) Guaranteed and unguaranteed portions. (1) All security must 
secure the entire loan or line of credit. The lender may not take 
separate security to secure only that portion of the loan or line of 
credit not covered by the guarantee.
    (2) The lender may not require compensating balances or certificates 
of deposit as means of eliminating the lender's exposure on the 
unguaranteed portion of the loan or line of credit. However, 
compensating balances or certificates of deposit as otherwise used in 
the ordinary course of business are allowed for both the guaranteed and 
unguaranteed portions.
    (c) Identifiable security. The guaranteed loan must be secured by 
identifiable collateral. To be identifiable, the lender must be able to 
distinguish the collateral item and adequately describe it in the 
security instrument.
    (d) Type of security. (1) Guaranteed loans may be secured by any 
property if the term of the loan and expected life of the property will 
not cause the loan to be undersecured.
    (2) For loans with terms greater than 7 years, a lien must be taken 
on real estate.

[[Page 245]]

    (3) Loans can be secured by a mortgage on leasehold properties if 
the lease has a negotiable value and is subject to being mortgaged.
    (4) The lender or Agency may require additional personal and 
corporate guarantees to adequately secure the loan. These guarantees are 
separate from, and in addition to, the personal obligations arising from 
members of an entity signing the note as individuals.
    (e) Lien position. All guaranteed loans will be secured by the best 
lien obtainable. Provided that:
    (1) When the loan is made for refinancing purposes, the guaranteed 
loan must hold a security position no lower than on the refinanced loan.
    (2) Any chattel-secured guaranteed loan must have a higher lien 
priority (including purchase money interest) than an unguaranteed loan 
secured by the same chattels and held by the same lender.
    (3) Junior lien positions are acceptable only if the equity position 
is strong. Junior liens on crops, or livestock products will not be 
relied upon for security unless the lender is involved in multiple 
guaranteed loans to the same borrower and also has the first lien on the 
collateral.
    (4) When taking a junior lien, prior lien instruments will not 
contain future advance clauses (except for taxes, insurance, or other 
reasonable costs to protect security), or cancellation, summary 
forfeiture, or other clauses that jeopardize the Government's or the 
lender's interest or the borrower's ability to pay the guaranteed loan, 
unless any such undesirable provisions are limited, modified, waived or 
subordinated by the lienholder for the benefit of the Agency and the 
lender.
    (f) Additional security, or any loan of $10,000 or less may be 
secured by the best lien obtainable on real estate without title 
clearance or legal services normally required, provided the lender 
believes from a search of the county records that the loan applicant can 
give a mortgage on the farm and provided that the lender would, in the 
normal course of business, waive the title search. This exception to 
title clearance will not apply when land is to be purchased.
    (g) Multiple owners. If security has multiple owners, all owners 
must execute the security documents for the loan.
    (h) Exceptions. The Deputy Administrator for Farm Loan Programs has 
the authority to grant an exception to any of the requirements involving 
security, if the proposed change is in the best interest of the 
Government and the collection of the loan will not be impaired.


<R05>
Sec. 762.127  Appraisal requirements.

    (a) General. The Agency may require a lender to obtain an appraisal 
based on the type of security, loan size, and whether it is primary or 
additional security. Except for authorized liquidation expenses, the 
lender is responsible for all appraisal costs, which may be passed on to 
the borrower, or a transferee in the case of a transfer and assumption.
    (b) Exception. Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, an 
appraisal is not required for any additional security, or for loans of 
$50,000 or less if a strong equity position exists.
    (c) Chattel appraisals. A current appraisal (not more than 12 months 
old) of primary chattel security is generally required on all loans. An 
appraisal for loans or lines of credit for annual production purposes 
that are secured by crops is only required when a guarantee is requested 
late in the current production year and actual yields can be reasonably 
estimated. The appraised value of chattel property will be based on 
public sales of the same, or similar, property in the market area. In 
the absence of such public sales, reputable publications reflecting 
market values may be used. Appraisal reports may be on the Agency's 
appraisal of chattel property form or on any other appraisal form 
containing at least the same information. Chattel appraisals will be 
performed by appraisers who possess sufficient experience or training to 
establish market (not retail) values as determined by the Agency.
    (d) Real estate appraisals. A current real estate appraisal is 
required when real estate will be primary security. Agency officials may 
accept an appraisal that is not current if there have

[[Page 246]]

been no significant changes in the market or on the subject real estate 
and the appraisal was either completed within the past 12 months or 
updated by a qualified appraisal if not completed within the past 12 
months.
    (1) Appraiser qualifications. On loan transactions of $250,000 or 
less, the lender must demonstrate to the Agency's satisfaction that the 
appraiser possesses sufficient experience or training to estimate the 
market value of agricultural property. On loan transactions greater than 
$250,000, which includes principal plus accrued interest through the 
closing date, the appraisal must be completed by a State certified 
general appraiser.
    (2) Appraisals. Real estate appraisals must be completed in 
accordance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal 
Practice. Appraisals may be either a complete or limited appraisal 
provided in a self-contained or summary format. Restricted reports, as 
defined in the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, are 
not acceptable.

<R05>
Sec. 762.128  Environmental and special laws.

    (a) Environmental requirements. The requirements found in part 1940, 
subpart G, of this title must be met for guaranteed OL and FO. CLP and 
PLP lenders may certify that they have documentation in their file to 
demonstrate compliance with paragraph (c) of this section. Standard 
eligible lenders must submit evidence supporting compliance with this 
section.
    (b) Determination. The Agency determination of whether an 
environmental problem exists will be based on:
    (1) The information supplied with the application;
    (2) The Agency Official's personal knowledge of the operation;
    (3) Environmental resources available to the Agency including, but 
not limited to, documents, third parties, and governmental agencies;
    (4) A visit to the farm operation when the available information is 
insufficient to make a determination;
    (5) Other information supplied by the lender or loan applicant upon 
Agency request. If necessary, information not supplied with the 
application will be requested by the Agency.
    (c) Special requirements. Lenders will assist in the environmental 
review process by providing environmental information. In all cases, the 
lender must retain documentation of their investigation in the loan 
applicant's case file.
    (1) A determination must be made as to whether there are any 
potential impacts to a 100 year floodplain as defined by Federal 
Emergency Management Agency floodplain maps, Natural Resources 
Conservation Service data, or other appropriate documentation.
    (2) The lender will assist the borrower in securing any applicable 
permits or waste management plans. The lender may consult with the 
Agency for guidance on activities which require consultation with State 
regulatory agencies, special permitting or waste management plans.
    (3) The lender will examine the security property to determine if 
there are any structures or archeological sites which are listed or may 
be eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The 
lender may consult with the Agency for guidance on which situations will 
need further review in accordance with the National Historical 
Preservation Act and part 1940, subpart G, and part 1901, subpart F, of 
this title.
    (4) The loan applicant must certify they will not violate the 
provisions of Sec. 363 of the CONACT, the Food Security Act of 1985, and 
Executive Order 11990 relating to Highly Erodible Land and Wetlands.
    (5) All lenders are required to ensure that due diligence is 
performed in conjunction with a request for guarantee of a loan 
involving real estate. Due diligence is the process of evaluating real 
estate in the context of a real estate transaction to determine the 
presence of contamination from release of hazardous substances, 
petroleum products, or other environmental hazards and determining what 
effect, if any, the contamination has on the security value of the 
property. The Agency will accept as evidence of due diligence the

[[Page 247]]

most current version of the American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM) 
transaction screen questionnaire available from 100 Barr Harbor Drive, 
West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428-2959, or similar documentation, 
approved for use by the Agency, supplemented as necessary by the ASTM 
phase I environmental site assessments form.
    (d) Equal opportunity and nondiscrimination. (1) With respect to any 
aspect of a credit transaction, the lender will not discriminate against 
any applicant on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, 
sex, marital status, or age, provided the applicant can execute a legal 
contract. Nor will the lender discriminate on the basis of whether all 
or a part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance 
program, or whether the applicant in good faith, exercises any rights 
under the Consumer Protection Act.
    (2) Where the guaranteed loan involves construction, the contractor 
or subcontractor must file all compliance reports, equal opportunity and 
nondiscrimination forms, and otherwise comply with all regulations 
prescribed by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to Executive Orders 11246 
and 11375.
    (e) Other Federal, State and local requirements. Lenders are 
required to coordinate with all appropriate Federal, State, and local 
agencies and comply with special laws and regulations applicable to the 
loan proposal.


<R05>
Sec. 762.129  Percent of guarantee and maximum loss.

    (a) General. The percent of guarantee will not exceed 90 percent 
based on the credit risk to the lender and the Agency both before and 
after the transaction. The Agency will determine the percentage of 
guarantee.
    (b) Exceptions. The guarantee will be issued at 95 percent in any of 
the following circumstances:
    (1) The sole purpose of a guaranteed FO or OL is to refinance an 
Agency direct farm loan. When only a portion of the loan is used to 
refinance a direct Agency farm credit program loan, a weighted 
percentage of a guarantee will be provided;
    (2) When the purpose of an FO guarantee is to participate in the 
down payment loan program; or
    (3) When a guaranteed OL is made to a farmer or rancher who is 
participating in the Agency's down payment loan program. The guaranteed 
OL must be made during the period that a borrower has the down payment 
loan outstanding.
    (c) CLP and PLP guarantees. All guarantees issued to CLP or PLP 
lenders will not be less than 80 percent.
    (d) Maximum loss. The maximum amount the Agency will pay the lender 
under the loan guarantee will be any loss sustained by such lender on 
the guaranteed portion including:
    (1) The pro rata share of principal and interest indebtedness as 
evidenced by the note or by assumption agreement;
    (2) Any loan subsidy due and owing;
    (3) The pro rata share of principal and interest indebtedness on 
secured protective and emergency advances made in accordance with this 
subpart; and
    (4) Principal and interest indebtedness on recapture debt pursuant 
to a shared appreciation agreement. Provided that the lender has paid 
the Agency its pro rata share of the recapture amount due.


<R05>
Sec. 762.130  Loan approval and issuing the guarantee.

    (a) Processing timeframes. (1) Standard Eligible Lenders. Complete

    (4) The Agency will confirm the date an application is received with 
a written notification to the lender.
    (b) Funding preference. Loans are approved subject to the 
availability of funding. When it appears that there are not adequate 
funds to meet the needs of all approved loan applicants, applications 
that have been approved will be placed on a preference list according to 
the date of receipt of a complete application. If approved applications 
have been received on the same day, the following will be given 
priority:
    (1) An application from a veteran
    (2) An application from an Agency direct loan borrower
    (3) An application from a loan applicant who:
    (i) Has a dependent family,
    (ii) Is an owner of livestock and farm implements necessary to 
successfully carry out farming operations, or

condition, financial or otherwise, since submission of the application; 
and
    (xi) All other requirements specified in the conditional commitment 
have been met.
    (2) Inspections. The lender must notify the Agency of any scheduled 
inspections during construction and after the guarantee has been issued. 
The Agency may attend these field inspections. Any inspections or review 
performed by the Agency, including those with the lender, are solely for 
the benefit of the Agency. Agency inspections do not relieve any other 
parties of their inspection responsibilities, nor can these parties rely 
on Agency inspections for any purpose.
    (3) Execution of lender's agreement. The lender must execute the 
Agency's lender's agreement and deliver it to the Agency.

[[Page 249]]

    (4) Closing report and guarantee fees.
    (i) The lender must complete an Agency closing report form and 
return it to the Agency along with any guarantee fees.
    (ii) Guarantee fees are 1 percent and are calculated as follows:

Agency direct loan; and
    (C) Loans to beginning farmers or ranchers involved in the direct 
beginning farmer downpayment program.
    (e) Promissory notes, line of credit agreements, mortgages, and 
security agreements. The lender will use its own promissory notes, line

mortgages in Louisiana and Puerto Rico), provided:
    (1) The forms meet Agency requirements;
    (2) Documents comply with State law and regulation;
    (3) The principal and interest repayment schedules are stated 
clearly in the notes and are consistent with the conditional commitment;
    (4) The note is executed by the individual liable for the loan. For 
entities, the note is executed by the member who is authorized to sign 
for the entity, and by all members of the entity as individuals. 
Individual liability can be waived by the Agency for members holding 
less than 10 percent ownership in the entity if the collectability of 
the loan will not be impaired; and
    (5) When the loan purpose is to refinance or restructure the 
lender's own debt, the lender may continue to use the existing debt 
instrument and attach an allonge that modifies the terms of the original 
note.
    (f) Replacement of loan guarantee, or assignment guarantee 
agreement. If the guarantee or assignment guarantee agreements are lost, 
stolen, destroyed, mutilated, or defaced, except where the evidence of 
debt was or is a bearer instrument, the Agency will issue a replacement

In the case of term loans, proceeds will be applied as extra payments 
and not as a regular installment on the loan.
    (ii) The security item will be used as a trade-in or source of down 
payment funds for a like item that will be taken as security.
    (iii) The security item has no present or prospective value.
    (2) A partial release of security may be approved in writing by the 
Agency upon the lender's request when:
    (i) Proceeds will be used to make improvements to real estate that 
increase the value of the security by an amount equal to or greater than 
the value of the security being released.
    (ii) Security will be released outright with no consideration, but 
the total unpaid balance of the guaranteed loan is less than or equal to 
75 percent of the value of the security for the loan after the release, 
excluding the value of growing crops or planned production, based on a 
current appraisal of the security.
    (iii) Significant income generating property will not be released 
unless it is being replaced and business assets will not be released for 
use as a gift or any similar purpose.
    (iv) Agency concurrence is provided in writing to the lender's 
written request. Standard eligible lenders and CLP lenders will submit 
the following to the Agency:
    (A) A current balance sheet on the borrower; and
    (B) A current appraisal of the security. Based on the level of risk 
and estimated equity involved, the Agency will determine what security 
needs to be appraised. Any required security appraisals must meet the 
requirements of Sec. 762.127; and
    (C) A description of the purpose of the release; and
    (D) Any other information requested by the Agency to evaluate the 
proposed servicing action.
    (3) The lender will provide the Agency copies of any agreements 
executed to carry out the servicing action.
    (4) PLP lenders will request servicing approval in accordance with 
their agreement with the Agency at the time of PLP status certification.
    (c) Subordinations. (1) The Agency may subordinate its security 
interest on a direct loan when a guaranteed loan is being made if the 
requirements of the regulations governing Agency direct loan 
subordinations are met and only in the following circumstances:
    (i) To permit a guaranteed lender to advance funds and perfect a 
security interest in crops, feeder livestock, livestock offspring, or 
livestock products;
    (ii) When the lender requesting the guarantee needs the 
subordination of the Agency's lien position to maintain its lien 
position when servicing or restructuring;
    (iii) When the lender requesting the guarantee is refinancing the 
debt of another lender and the Agency's position on real estate security 
will not be adversely affected; or
    (iv) To permit a line of credit to be advanced for annual operating 
expenses.
    (2) The Agency may subordinate its basic security in a direct loan 
to permit guaranteed line of credit only

[[Page 252]]

when both of the following additional conditions are met:
    (i) The total unpaid balance of the direct loans is less than or 
equal to 75 percent of the value of all of the security for the direct 
loans, excluding the value of growing crops or planned production, at 
the time of the subordination. The direct loan security value will be 
determined by an appraisal. The lender requesting the subordination and 
guarantee is responsible for providing the appraisal and may charge the 
applicant a reasonable appraisal fee.
    (ii) The applicant cannot obtain sufficient credit through a 
conventional guaranteed loan without a subordination.
    (3) The lender may not subordinate its interest in property which 
secures a guaranteed loan except as follows:
    (i) The lender may subordinate its security interest in crops, 
feeder livestock, livestock offspring, or livestock products when no 
funds have been advanced from the guaranteed loan for their production, 
so a lender can make a loan for annual production expenses; or
    (ii) The Agency's national office may provide an exception to the 
subordination prohibition if such action is in the Agency's best 
interest. However, in no case can the loan made under the subordination 
include tax exempt financing.
    (d) Transfer and assumption. Transfers and assumptions are subject 
to the following conditions:
    (1) For standard eligible and CLP lenders, the servicing action must 
be approved by the Agency in writing.
    (2) For standard eligible and CLP lenders, the transferee must apply 
for a loan in accordance with Sec. 762.110, including a current 
appraisal, unless the lien position of the guaranteed loan will not 
change, and any other information requested by the Agency to evaluate 
the transfer and assumption.
    (3) PLP lenders may process transfers and assumptions in accordance 
with their agreement with the Agency.
    (4) Any required security appraisals must meet the requirements of 
Sec. 762.127.
    (5) The Agency will review, approve or reject the request in 
accordance with the time frames in Sec. 762.130.
    (6) The transferee must meet the eligibility requirements and loan 
limitations for the loan being transferred, all requirements relating to 
loan rates and terms, loan security, feasibility, and environmental and 
other laws applicable to a loan applicant under this part.
    (7) The lender will use its own assumption agreements or conveyance 
instruments, providing they are legally sufficient to obligate the 
transferee for the total outstanding debt. The lender will provide the 
Agency copies of any agreements executed to carry out the servicing 
action.
    (8) The Agency approves the transfer and assumption by executing a 
modification of the guarantee to designate the party that assumed the 
guaranteed debt, the amount of debt at the time of the assumption, 
including interest that is being capitalized, and any new loan terms, if 
applicable.
    (9) The lender must give any holder notice of the transfer. If the 
rate and terms are changed, written concurrence from the holder is 
required.
    (10) The Agency will agree to releasing the transferor or any 
guarantor from liability only if the requirements of Sec. 762.146(c) are 
met.

Sec. 762.143  Servicing distressed accounts.

    (a) A borrower is in default when 30 days past due on a payment or 
in violation of provisions of the loan documents.
    (b) In the event of a borrower default, SEL and CLP lenders will:
    (1) Report to the Agency in accordance with Sec. 762.141.
    (2) Determine whether it will repurchase the guaranteed portion from 
the holder in accordance with Sec. 762.144, if the guaranteed portion of 
the loan was sold on the secondary market.
    (3) Arrange a meeting with the borrower within 15 days of default 
(45 days after payment due date for monetary defaults) to identify the 
nature of the delinquency and develop a course of action that will 
eliminate the delinquency and correct the underlying

[[Page 253]]

problems. Non-monetary defaults will be handled in accordance with the 
lender's note, loan agreements and any other applicable loan documents.
    (i) The lender and borrower will prepare a current balance sheet and 
cash flow projection in preparation for the meeting. If the borrower 
refuses to cooperate, the lender will compile the best financial 
information available.
    (ii) The lender or the borrower may request the attendance of an 
Agency credit officer. If requested, the Agency credit officer will 
assist in developing solutions to the borrower's financial problems.
    (iii) The lender will summarize the meeting and proposed solutions 
on the Agency form for guaranteed loan borrower default status completed 
after the meeting. The lender will indicate the results on this form for 
the lender's consideration of the borrower for interest assistance in 
conjunction with rescheduling under Sec. 762.145(b).
    (iv) The lender must decide whether to restructure or liquidate the 
account within 90 days of default, unless the lender can document 
circumstances that justify an extension by the Agency.
    (v) The lender may not initiate foreclosure action on the loan until 
60 days after eligibility of the borrower to participate in the interest 
assistance programs has been determined by the Agency. If the lender or 
the borrower does not wish to consider servicing options under this 
section, this should be documented, and liquidation under Sec. 762.149 
should begin.
    (vi) If a borrower is current on a loan, but will be unable to make 
a payment, a restructuring proposal may be submitted in accordance with 
Sec. 762.145 prior to the payment coming due.
    (c) PLP lenders will service defaulted loans according to their 
lender's agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 762.144  Repurchase of guaranteed portion from a secondary market holder.

    (a) Request for repurchase. The holder may request the lender to 
repurchase the unpaid guaranteed portion of the loan when:
    (1) The borrower has not made a payment of principal and interest 
due on the loan for at least 60 days; or
    (2) The lender has failed to remit to the holder its pro-rata share 
of any payment made by the borrower within 30 days of receipt of a 
payment.
    (b) Repurchase by the lender. (1) When a lender is requested to 
repurchase a loan from the holder, the lender must consider the request 
according to the servicing actions that are necessary on the loan. In 
order to facilitate servicing and simplified accounting of loan 
transactions, lenders are encouraged to repurchase the loan upon the 
holder's request.
    (2) The repurchase by the lender will be for an amount equal to the 
portion of the loan held by the holder plus accrued interest.
    (3) The guarantee will not cover separate servicing fees that the 
lender accrues after the repurchase.
    (c) Repurchase by the Agency. (1) If the lender does not repurchase 
the loan, the holder must inform the Agency in writing that demand was 
made on the lender and the lender refused. Following the lender's 
refusal, the holder may continue as holder of the guaranteed portion of 
the loan or request that the Agency purchase the guaranteed portion. 
Within 30 days after written demand to the Agency from the holder with 
required attachments, the Agency will forward to the holder payment of 
the unpaid principal balance, with accrued interest to the date of 
repurchase. If the holder does not desire repurchase or purchase of a 
defaulted loan, the lender must forward the holder its pro-rata share of 
payments, liquidation proceeds and Agency loss payments.
    (2) With its demand on the Agency, the holder must include:
    (i) A copy of the written demand made upon the lender.
    (ii) Originals of the guarantee and note properly endorsed to the 
Agency, or the original of the assignment of guarantee.
    (iii) A copy of any written response to the demand of the holder by 
the lender.
    (iv) An account to which the Agency can forward the purchase amount 
via electronic funds transfer.

[[Page 254]]

    (3) The amount due the holder from the Agency includes unpaid 
principal, unpaid interest to the date of demand, and interest which has 
accrued from the date of demand to the proposed payment date.
    (i) Upon request by the Agency, the lender must furnish upon Agency 
request a current statement, certified by a bank officer, of the unpaid 
principal and interest owed by the borrower and the amount due the 
holder.
    (ii) Any discrepancy between the amount claimed by the holder and 
the information submitted by the lender must be resolved by the lender 
and the holder before payment will be approved by the Agency. The Agency 
will not participate in resolution of any such discrepancy. When there 
is a discrepancy, the 30 day Agency payment requirement to the holder 
will be suspended until the discrepancy is resolved.
    (iii) In the case of a request for Agency purchase, the government 
will only pay interest that accrues for up to 90 days from the date of 
the demand letter to the lender requesting the repurchase. However, if 
the lender requested repurchase from the Agency within 60 days of the 
request to the holder and for any reason not attributable to the holder 
and the lender, the Agency cannot make payment within 30 days of the 
holder's demand to the Agency, the holder will be entitled to interest 
to the date of the payment.
    (4) At the time of purchase by the Agency, the original assignment 
of guarantee will be assigned by the holder to the Agency without 
recourse, including all rights, title, and interest in the loan.
    (5) Purchase by the Agency does not change, alter, or modify any of 
the lender's obligations to the Agency specified in the lender's 
agreement or guarantee; nor does the purchase waive any of the Agency's 
rights against the lender.
    (6) The Agency succeeds to all rights of the holder under the 
Guarantee including the right of set-off against the lender.
    (7) Within 180 days of the Agency's purchase, the lender will 
reimburse the Agency the amount of repurchase, with accrued interest, 
through one of the following ways:
    (i) By liquidating the loan security and paying the Agency its pro-
rata share of liquidation proceeds; or
    (ii) Paying the Agency the full amount the Agency paid to the holder 
plus any accrued interest.
    (8) The lender will be liable for the purchase amount and any 
expenses incurred by the Agency to maintain the loan in its portfolio or 
liquidate the security. While the Agency holds the guaranteed portion of 
the loan, the lender will transmit to the Agency any payment received 
from the borrower, including the pro-rata share of liquidation or other 
proceeds.
    (9) If the borrower files for reorganization under the provisions of 
the bankruptcy code or pays the account current while the purchase by 
the Government is being processed, the Agency may hold the loan as long 
it determines this action to be in the Agency's interest. If the lender 
is not proceeding expeditiously to collect the loan or reimbursement is 
not waived under this paragraph, the Agency will demand payment by the 
lender and collect the purchase amount through administrative offset of 
any claims due the lender.
    (10) The Agency may sell a purchased guaranteed loan on a non-
recourse basis if it determines that selling the portion of the loan 
that it holds is in the Government's best interest. A non-recourse 
purchase from the Agency requires a written request to the Agency from 
the party that wishes to purchase it, and written concurrence from the 
lender;
    (d) Repurchase for servicing. (1) If, due to loan default or 
imminent loan restructuring, the lender determines that repurchase is 
necessary to adequately service the loan, the lender may repurchase the 
guaranteed portion of the loan from the holder, with the written 
approval of the Agency.
    (2) The lender will not repurchase from the holder for arbitrage 
purposes. With its request for Agency concurrence, the lender will 
notify the Agency of its plans to resell the guaranteed portion 
following servicing.
    (3) The holder will sell the guaranteed portion of the loan to the 
lender

[[Page 255]]

for an amount agreed to between the lender and holder.


<R05>
Sec. 762.145  Restructuring guaranteed loans.

    (a) General. (1) To restructure guaranteed loans standard eligible 
lenders must:
    (i) Obtain prior written approval of the Agency for all 
restructuring actions; and,
    (ii) Provide the items in paragraph (b) and (e) of this section to 
the Agency for approval.
    (2) If the standard eligible lender's proposal for servicing is not 
agreed to by the Agency, the Agency approval official will notify the 
lender in writing within 14 days of the lender's request.
    (3) To restructure guaranteed loans CLP lenders must:
    (i) Obtain prior written approval of the Agency only for debt write 
down under this section.
    (ii) Submit all calculations required in paragraph (e) of this 
section for debt writedown.
    (iii) For restructuring other than write down, provide FSA with a 
certification that each requirement of this section has been met, a 
narrative outlining the circumstances surrounding the need for 
restructuring, and copies of any applicable calculations.
    (4) PLP lenders will restructure loans in accordance with their 
lender's agreement.
    (5) All lenders will submit copies of any restructured notes or 
lines of credit to the Agency.
    (b) Requirements. For any restructuring action, the following 
conditions apply:
    (1) The borrower meets the eligibility criteria of Sec. 762.120, 
except the provisions regarding prior debt forgiveness and delinquency 
on a federal debt do not apply.
    (2) The borrower's ability to make the amended payment is documented 
by the following:
    (i) A feasible plan (see Sec. 762.102(b)). If interest assistance is 
required to achieve a feasible plan, the items required by 
Sec. 762.150(d) must be submitted with a restructuring request. Feasible 
plan is defined in Sec. 762.102(b).
    (ii) Current financial statements from all liable parties.
    (iii) Verification of nonfarm income.
    (iv) Verification of all debts of $1,000 or more.
    (v) Applicable credit reports.
    (vi) Financial history (and production history for standard eligible 
lenders) for the past 3 years to support the cash flow projections.
    (3) A final loss claim may be reduced, adjusted, or rejected as a 
result of negligent servicing after the concurrence with a restructuring 
action under this section.
    (4) Balloon payments are prohibited; however, the loan can be 
restructured with unequal installments, provided that, in addition to a 
feasible plan for the upcoming operating cycle, a feasible plan can be 
reasonably projected after the installments increase. Feasible plan is 
defined in Sec. 762.102(b).
    (5) If a borrower is current on a loan, but will be unable to make a 
payment, a restructuring proposal may be submitted prior to the payment 
coming due.
    (6) The lender may capitalize the outstanding interest when 
restructuring the loan as follows:
    (i) As a result of the capitalization of interest, a rescheduled 
promissory note may increase the amount of principal which the borrower 
is required to pay. However, in no case will such principal amount 
exceed the statutory loan limits contained in Sec. 762.122.
    (ii) When accrued interest causes the loan amount to exceed the 
statutory loan limits, rescheduling may be approved without 
capitalization of the amount that exceeds the limit. Noncapitalized 
interest may be scheduled for repayment over the term of the rescheduled 
note.
    (iii) Only interest that has accrued at the rate indicated on the 
borrower's original promissory notes may be capitalized. Late payment 
fees or default interest penalties that have accrued due to the 
borrower's failure to make payments as agreed are not covered under the 
guarantee and may not be capitalized.
    (iv) The Agency will execute a modification of guarantee form to 
identify the new loan principal and the guaranteed portion if greater 
than the original loan amounts, and to waive the restriction on 
capitalization of interest,

[[Page 256]]

if applicable, to the existing guarantee documents. The modification 
form will be attached to the original guarantee as an addendum.
    (v) Approved capitalized interest will be treated as part of the 
principal and interest that accrues thereon, in the event that a loss 
should occur.
    (7) The lender's security position will not be adversely affected 
because of the restructuring. New security instruments may be taken if 
needed, but a loan does not have to be fully secured in order to be 
restructured.
    (8) Any holder agrees in writing to any changes in the original loan 
terms, including the approval of interest assistance. If the holder does 
not agree, the lender must repurchase the loan from the holder for any 
loan restructuring to occur.
    (9) After a guaranteed loan is restructured, the lender must provide 
the Agency with a copy of the restructured promissory note.
    (c) Rescheduling. The following conditions apply when a guaranteed 
loan is rescheduled or reamortized:
    (1) Payments will be rescheduled within the following terms:
    (i) FO and existing SW may be amortized over the remaining term of 
the note or rescheduled with an uneven payment schedule. The maturity 
date cannot exceed 40 years from the date of the original note.
    (ii) OL notes must be rescheduled over a period not to exceed 15 
years from the date of the rescheduling. An OL line of credit may be 
rescheduled over a period not to exceed 7 years from the date of the 
rescheduling or 10 years from the date of the original note, whichever 
is less. Advances cannot be made against a line of credit loan that has 
had any portion of the loan rescheduled.
    (2) The interest rate for a rescheduled loan is the negotiated rate 
agreed upon by the lender and the borrower at the time of the action, 
subject to the loan limitations for each type of loan.
    (3) A new note is not necessary when rescheduling occurs. However, 
if a new note is not taken, the existing note or line of credit 
agreement must be modified by attaching an allonge or other legally 
effective amendment, evidencing the revised repayment schedule and any 
interest rate change. If a new note is taken, the new note must 
reference the old note and state that the indebtedness evidenced by the 
old note or line of credit agreement is not satisfied. The original note 
or line of credit agreement must be retained.
    (d) Deferrals. The following conditions apply to deferrals:
    (1) Payments may be deferred up to 5 years, but the loan may not be 
extended beyond the final due date of the note.
    (2) The principal portion of the payment may be deferred either in 
whole or in part.
    (3) Interest may be deferred only in part. Payment of a reasonable 
portion of accruing interest as indicated by the borrower's cash flow 
projections is required for multi-year deferrals.
    (4) There must be a reasonable prospect that the borrower will be 
able to resume full payments at the end of the deferral period.
    (e) Debt writedown. The following conditions apply to debt 
writedown:
    (1) A lender may only write down a delinquent guaranteed loan or 
line of credit in an amount sufficient to permit the borrower to develop 
a feasible plan as defined in Sec. 762.102(b).
    (2) The lender will request other creditors to negotiate their debts 
before a writedown is considered.
    (3) The borrower cannot develop a feasible plan after consideration 
is given to rescheduling and deferral under this section.
    (4) The present value of the loan to be written down, based on the 
interest rate of the rescheduled loan, will be equal to or exceed the 
net recovery value of the loan collateral.
    (5) The loan will be restructured with regular payments at terms no 
shorter than 5 years for a line of credit and OL note and no shorter 
than 20 years for FO, unless required to be shorter by 
Sec. 762.145(c)(1)(i) and (ii).
    (6) No further advances may be made on a line of credit that is 
written down.
    (7) Loans may not be written down with interest assistance. If a 
borrower's loan presently on interest assistance requires a writedown, 
the writedown will be considered without interest assistance.

[[Page 257]]

    (8) The writedown is based on writing down the shorter-term loans 
first.
    (9) When a lender requests approval of a writedown for a borrower 
with multiple loans, the security for all of the loans will be cross-
collateralized and continue to serve as security for the loan that is 
written down. If a borrower has multiple loans and one loan is written 
off entirely through debt writedown, the security for that loan will not 
be released and will remain as security for the other written down debt. 
Additional security instruments will be taken if required to cross-
collateralize security and maintain lien priority.
    (10) The writedown will be evidenced by an allonge or amendment to 
the existing note or line of credit reflecting the writedown.
    (11) The borrower executes an Agency shared appreciation agreement 
for loans which are written down and secured by real estate.
    (i) The lender will attach the original agreement to the 
restructured loan document.
    (ii) The lender will provide the Agency a copy of the executed 
agreement, and
    (iii) Security instruments must ensure future collection of any 
appreciation under the agreement.
    (12) The lender will prepare and submit the following to the Agency:
    (i) A current appraisal of all security in accordance with 
Sec. 762.127.
    (ii) A completed report of loss on the appropriate Agency form for 
the proposed writedown loss claim.
    (iii) Detailed writedown calculations as follows:
    (A) Calculate the present value.
    (B) Determine the net recovery value.
    (C) If the net recovery value exceeds the present value, writedown 
is unavailable; liquidation becomes the next servicing consideration. If 
the present value equals or exceeds the net recovery value, the debt may 
be written down to the present value.
    (iv) The lender will make any adjustment in the calculations as 
requested by the Agency.

[64 FR 7378, Feb. 12, 1999; 64 FR 38298, July 16, 1999, as amended at 66 
FR 7567, Jan. 24, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 762.146  Other servicing procedures.

    (a) Additional loans and advances. (1) Notwithstanding any provision 
of this section, the PLP lender may make additional loans or advances in 
accordance with the lender's agreement with the Agency.
    (2) SEL and CLP lenders must not make additional loans or advances 
without prior written approval of the Agency, except as provided in the 
borrower's loan or line of credit agreement.
    (3) In cases of a guaranteed line of credit, lenders may make an 
emergency advance when a line of credit has reached its ceiling. The 
emergency advance will be made as an advance under the line and not as a 
separate note. The lender's loan documents must contain sufficient 
language to provide that any emergency advance will constitute a debt of 
the borrower to the lender and be secured by the security instrument. 
The following conditions apply:
    (i) The loan funds to be advanced are for authorized operating loan 
purposes;
    (ii) The financial benefit to the lender and the Government from the 
advance will exceed the amount of the advance; and
    (iii) The loss of crops or livestock is imminent unless the advance 
is made.
    (4) Protective advance requirements are found in Sec. 762.149.
    (b) Release of liability upon withdrawal. An individual who is 
obligated on a guaranteed loan may be released from liability by a 
lender, with the written consent of the Agency, provided the following 
conditions have been met:
    (1) The individual to be released has withdrawn from the farming or 
ranching operation;
    (2) A divorce decree or final property settlement does not hold the 
withdrawing party responsible for the loan payments;
    (3) The withdrawing party's interest in the security is conveyed to 
the individual or entity with whom the loan will be continued;
    (4) The ratio of the amount of debt to the value of the remaining 
security is less than or equal to .75, or the withdrawing party has no 
income or assets from which collection can be made; and

[[Page 258]]

    (5) Withdrawal of the individual does not result in legal 
dissolution of the entity to which the loans are made. Individually 
liable members of a general or limited partnership may not be released 
from liability.
    (6) The remaining liable party projects a feasible plan (see 
Sec. 762.102(b)).
    (c) Release of liability after liquidation. After a final loss claim 
has been paid on the borrower's account, the lender may release the 
borrower or guarantor from liability if;
    (1) The Agency agrees to the release in writing;
    (2) The lender documents its consideration of the following factors 
concerning the borrower or guarantors:
    (i) The likelihood that the borrower or guarantor will have a 
sufficient level of income in the reasonably near future to contribute 
to a meaningful reduction of the debt;
    (ii) The prospect that the borrower or guarantor will inherit assets 
in the near term that may be attached by the Agency for payment of a 
significant portion of the debt;
    (iii) Whether collateral has been properly accounted for, and 
whether liability should be retained in order to take action against the 
borrower or a third party for conversion of security;
    (iv) The availability of other income or assets which are not 
security;
    (v) The possibility that assets have been concealed or improperly 
transferred;
    (vi) The effect of other guarantors on the loan; and
    (vii) Cash consideration or other collateral in exchange for the 
release of liability.
    (3) The lender will use its own release of liability documents.
    (d) Interest rate changes. (1) The lender may change the interest 
rate on a performing (nondelinquent) loan only with the borrower's 
consent.
    (2) If the loan has been sold on the secondary market, the lender 
must repurchase the loan or obtain the holder's written consent.
    (3) To change a fixed rate of interest to a variable rate of 
interest or vice versa, the lender and the borrower must execute a 
legally effective allonge or amendment to the existing note.
    (4) If a new note is taken, it will be attached to and refer to the 
original note.
    (5) The lender will inform the Agency of the rate change.
    (e) Consolidation. Two or more Agency guaranteed loans may be 
consolidated, subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The borrower must project a feasible plan after the 
consolidation. See Sec. 762.102(b) for definition of feasible plan.
    (2) Only OL may be consolidated.
    (3) Existing lines of credit may only be consolidated with a new 
line of credit if the final maturity date and conditions for advances of 
the new line of credit are made the same as the existing line of credit.
    (4) Guaranteed OL may not be consolidated with a line of credit, 
even if the line of credit has been rescheduled.
    (5) Guaranteed loans made prior to October 1, 1991, cannot be 
consolidated with those loans made on or after October 1, 1991.
    (6) OL secured by real estate or with an outstanding interest 
assistance agreement or shared appreciation agreement cannot be 
consolidated.
    (7) A new note or line of credit agreement will be taken. The new 
note or line of credit agreement must describe the note or line of 
credit agreement being consolidated and must state that the indebtedness 
evidenced by the note or line of credit agreement is not satisfied. The 
original note or line of credit agreement must be retained.
    (8) The interest rate for a consolidated OL loan is the negotiated 
rate agreed upon by the lender and the borrower at the time of the 
action, subject to the loan limitations for each type of loan.
    (9) The Agency approves the consolidation by executing a 
modification of guarantee. The modification will indicate the 
consolidated loan amount, new terms, and percentage of guarantee, and 
will be attached to the originals of the guarantees being consolidated. 
If loans with a different guarantee percentage are consolidated, the new 
guarantee will be at the lowest percentage of guarantee being 
consolidated

[[Page 259]]

    (10) Any holders must consent to the consolidation, or the 
guaranteed portion must be repurchased by the lender.

such borrower will not be treated as a conveyance under the agreement.
    (ii) On repayment of the loan; or
    (iii) If the borrower ceases farming.
    (2) Calculating recapture.
    (i) The amount of recapture will be based on the difference between 
the value of the security at the time recapture is triggered and the 
value of the security at the time of writedown, as shown on the shared 
appreciation agreement.
    (ii) Security values will be determined through appraisals obtained 
by the lender and meeting the requirements of Sec. 762.127.

shared appreciation agreement, the lender shall recapture 50 percent of 
any positive appreciation in the market value of the property securing 
the loan or line of credit agreement.
    (3) Servicing recapture debt.
    (i) If recapture is triggered under the shared appreciation 
agreement and the borrower is unable to pay the recapture in a lump sum, 
the lender may:
    (A) Reschedule the recapture debt with the consent of the Agency,

amortized payments on the recapture debt, plus pay all other 
obligations. In such case, the recapture debt will not be covered by the

guarantee; or
    (C) Service the account in accordance with Sec. 762.149.

lender will be shared on a pro-rata basis between the lender and the 
Agency.

and
    (7) Keeping the Agency regularly informed in writing on all aspects 
of the proceedings.
    (i) The lender will submit a default status report when the borrower 
defaults and every 60 days until the default is resolved or a final loss 
claim is paid.
    (ii) The default status report will be used to inform the Agency of 
the bankruptcy filing, the reorganization plan confirmation date and 
effective date, when the reorganization plan is complete, and when the 
borrower is not in compliance with the reorganization plan.
    (b) Bankruptcy expenses. (1) Reorganization.
    (i) Expenses, such as legal fees and the cost of appraisals incurred 
by the lender as a direct result of the borrower's chapter 11, 12, or 13 
reorganization, are covered under the guarantee, provided they are 
reasonable, customary, and provide a demonstrated economic benefit to 
the lender and the Agency.
    (ii) Lender's in-house expenses, which are those expenses which 
would normally be incurred for administration of the loan, including in-
house lawyers, are not covered by the guarantee.
    (2) Liquidation expenses in bankruptcy.
    (i) Reasonable and customary liquidation expenses may be deducted 
from the proceeds of the collateral in liquidation bankruptcy cases.
    (ii) In-house expenses are not considered customary liquidation 
expenses, may not be deducted from collateral proceeds, and are not 
covered by the guarantee.
    (c) Estimated loss claims in reorganization. (1) At confirmation. 
The lender may submit an estimated loss claim upon confirmation of the 
reorganization plan in accordance with the following:
    (i) The estimated loss payment will cover the guaranteed percentage 
of the principal and accrued interest written off, plus any allowable 
costs incurred as of the effective date of the plan.

claim, and any additional information requested by the Agency, including 
justification for the legal fees included on the claim.
    (iii) The estimated loss payment may be revised as consistent with a 
court-approved reorganization plan.
    (iv) Protective advances made and approved in accordance with 
Sec. 762.149 may be included in an estimated loss claim associated with 
a reorganization, if:
    (A) They were incurred in connection with the initiation of 
liquidation action prior to bankruptcy filing; or
    (B) The advance is required to provide repairs, insurance, etc. to 
protect the collateral as a result of delays in the case, or failure of 
the borrower to maintain the security.
    (2) Interest only losses. The lender may submit an estimated loss 
claim for interest only after confirmation of the reorganization plan in 
accordance with the following:
    (i) The loss claims may cover interest losses sustained as a result 
of a court-ordered, permanent interest rate reduction.
    (ii) The loss claims will be processed annually on the anniversary 
date of the effective date of the reorganization plan.
    (iii) If the borrower performs under the terms of the reorganization 
plan, annual interest reduction loss claims will be submitted on or near 
the same date, beyond the period of the reorganization plan.
    (3) Actual loss.
    (i) Once the reorganization plan is complete, the lender will 
provide the Agency with documentation of the actual loss sustained.
    (ii) If the actual loss sustained is greater than the prior 
estimated loss payment, the lender may submit a revised estimated loss 
claim to obtain

[[Page 261]]

payment of the additional amount owed by the Agency under the guarantee.
    (iii) If the actual loss is less than the prior estimated loss, the 
lender will reimburse the Agency for the overpayment plus interest at 
the note rate from the date of the payment of the estimated loss.
    (4) Payment to holder. In reorganization bankruptcy, if a holder 
makes demand upon the Agency, the Agency will pay the holder interest to 
the plan's effective date. Accruing interest thereafter will be based 
upon the provisions of the reorganization plan.
    (d) Liquidation under the bankruptcy code. (1) Upon receipt of 
notification that a borrower has filed for protection under Chapter 7 of 
the bankruptcy code, or a liquidation plan under chapter 11, the lender 
must proceed according to the liquidation procedures of this part.
    (2) If the property is abandoned by the trustee, the lender will 
conduct the liquidation according to Sec. 762.149.
    (3) Proceeds received from partial sale of collateral during 
bankruptcy may be used by the lender to pay reasonable costs, such as 
freight, labor and sales commissions, associated with the partial sale. 
Reasonable use of proceeds for this purpose must be documented with the 
final loss claim in accordance with Sec. 762.149(a)(vi).


<R05>
Sec. 762.149  Liquidation.

    (a) Mediation. When it has been determined that default cannot be 
cured through any of the servicing options available, or if the lender 
does not wish to utilize any of the authorities provided in this part, 
the lender must:
    (1) Participate in mediation according to the rules and regulations 
of any State which has a mandatory farmer-creditor mediation program;
    (2) Consider private mediation services in those States which do not 
have a mandatory farmer-creditor mediation program; and
    (3) Not agree to any proposals to rewrite the terms of a guaranteed 
loan which do not comply with this part. Any agreements reached as a 
result of mediation involving defaults and or loan restructuring must 
have written concurrence from the Agency before they are implemented.
    (b) Liquidation plan. If a default cannot be cured after considering 
servicing options and mediation, the lender will proceed with 
liquidation of the collateral in accordance with the following:
    (1) Within 30 days of the decision to liquidate, standard eligible 
and CLP lenders will submit a written liquidation plan to the Agency 
which includes:
    (i) Current balance sheets from all liable parties or, if the 
parties are not cooperative, the best information available, or in 
liquidation bankruptcies, a copy of the bankruptcy schedules or 
discharge notice;
    (ii) A proposed method of maximizing the collection of debt which 
includes specific plans to collect any remaining loan balances on the 
guaranteed loan after loan collateral has been liquidated, including 
possibilities for judgment;
    (A) If the borrower has converted loan security, the lender will 
determine whether litigation is cost effective. The lender must address, 
in the liquidation plan, whether civil or criminal action will be 
pursued. If the lender does not pursue the recovery, the reason must be 
documented when an estimated loss claim is submitted.
    (B) Any proposal to release the borrower from liability will be 
addressed in the liquidation plan in accordance with Sec. 762.146(c)(2);
    (iii) An independent appraisal report on all collateral securing the 
loan that meets the requirements of Sec. 762.127 and a calculation of 
the net recovery value of the security as defined in Sec. 762.102. The 
appraisal requirement may be waived by the Agency in the following 
cases:
    (A) The bankruptcy trustee is handling the liquidation and the 
lender has submitted the trustee's determination of value;
    (B) The lender's proposed method of liquidation rarely results in 
receipt of less than market value for livestock and used equipment; or
    (C) A purchase offer has already been received for more than the 
debt;
    (iv) An estimate of time necessary to complete the liquidation;

[[Page 262]]

    (v) An estimated loss claim if the liquidation period is expected to 
exceed 90 days.
    (vi) An estimate of reasonable liquidation expenses; and
    (vii) An estimate of any protective advances.
    (2) PLP lenders will submit a liquidation plan as required by their 
lender's agreement.
    (c) Agency approval of the liquidation plan. (1) CLP lender's or 
standard eligible lender's liquidation plan, and any revisions of the 
plan, must be approved by the Agency.
    (2) If, within 20 calendar days of the Agency's receipt of the 
liquidation plan, the Agency fails to approve it or fails to request 
that the lender make revisions, the lender may assume the plan is 
approved. The lender may then proceed to begin liquidation actions at 
its discretion as long as it has been at least 60 days since the 
borrower's eligibility for interest assistance was considered.
    (3) At its option, the Agency may liquidate the guaranteed loan as 
follows:
    (i) Upon Agency request, the lender will transfer to the Agency all 
rights and interests necessary to allow the Agency to liquidate the 
loan. The Agency will not pay the lender for any loss until after the 
collateral is liquidated and the final loss is determined; and
    (ii) If the Agency conducts the liquidation, interest accrual will 
cease on the date the Agency notifies the lender in writing that it 
assumes responsibility for the liquidation.
    (d) Estimated loss claims. An estimated loss claim will be submitted 
by the lender with the liquidation plan if the liquidation is expected 
to exceed 90 days. The estimated loss will be based on the following:
    (1) The Agency will pay the lender the guaranteed percentage of the 
total outstanding debt, less the net recovery value of the remaining 
security, less any unaccounted for security; and
    (2) The lender will discontinue interest accrual on the defaulted 
loan at the time the estimated loss claim is paid by the Agency. If the 
lender estimates that there will be no loss after considering the costs 
of liquidation, interest accrual will cease 90 days after the decision 
to liquidate or an estimated loss of zero will be submitted.
    (e) Protective advances. (1) Prior written authorization from the 
Agency is required for all protective advances in excess of $5,000 for 
CLP lenders and $3,000 for standard eligible lenders. The dollar amount 
of protective advances allowed for PLP lenders will be specified when 
PLP status is awarded by the Agency or as contained in the lender's 
agreement.
    (2) The lender may claim recovery for the guaranteed portion of any 
loss of monies advanced as protective advances as allowed in this part, 
plus interest that accrues on the protective advances.
    (3) Payment for protective advances is made by the Agency when the 
final loss claim is approved, except in bankruptcy actions.
    (4) Protective advances are used only when the borrower is in 
liquidation, liquidation is imminent, or when the lender has taken title 
to real property in a liquidation action.
    (5) Legal fees are not a protective advance.
    (6) Protective advances may only be made when the lender can 
demonstrate the advance is in the best interest of the lender and the 
Agency.
    (7) Protective advances must constitute a debt of the borrower to 
the lender and be secured by the security instrument.
    (8) Protective advances must not be made in lieu of additional 
loans.
    (f) Unapproved loans or advances. The amount of any payments made by 
the borrower on unapproved loans or advances outside of the guarantee 
will be deducted from any loss claim submitted by the lender on the 
guaranteed loan, if that loan or advance was paid prior to, and to the 
detriment of, the guaranteed loan.
    (g) Acceleration. (1) If the borrower is not in bankruptcy, the 
lender shall send the borrower notice that the loan is in default and 
the entire debt has been determined due and payable immediately after 
other servicing options have been exhausted.
    (2) The loan cannot be accelerated until after the borrower has been 
considered for interest assistance and the

[[Page 263]]

conclusion of mandatory mediation in accordance with Sec. 762.149.
    (3) The lender will submit a copy of the acceleration notice or 
other document to the Agency.
    (h) Foreclosure. (1) The lender is responsible for determining the 
necessary parties to any foreclosure action, or who should be named on a 
deed of conveyance taken in lieu of foreclosure.
    (2) When the property is liquidated, the lender will apply the net 
proceeds to the guaranteed loan debt.
    (3) When it is necessary to enter a bid at a foreclosure sale, the 
lender may bid the amount that it determines is reasonable to protect 
its and the Agency's interest. At a minimum, the lender will bid the 
lesser of the net recovery value or the unpaid guaranteed loan balance.
    (i) Final loss claims. (1) Lenders may submit a final loss claim 
when the security has been liquidated and all proceeds have been 
received and applied to the account.
    (2) If a lender acquires title to property either through voluntary 
conveyance or foreclosure proceeding, the lender will submit a final 
loss claim after disposing of the property. The lender may pay 
reasonable maintenance expenses to protect the value of the property 
while it is owned by the lender. These may be paid as protective 
advances or deducted as liquidation expenses from the sales proceeds 
when the lender disposes of the property. The lender must obtain Agency 
written concurrence before incurring maintenance expenses which exceed 
the amounts allowed in Sec. 762.149(e)(1).
    (3) The lender will make its records available to the Agency for the 
Agency's audit of the propriety of any loss payment.
    (4) All lenders will submit the following documents with a final 
loss claim:
    (i) An accounting of the use of loan funds;
    (ii) An accounting of the disposition of loan security and its 
proceeds;
    (iii) A copy of the loan ledger indicating loan advances, interest 
rate changes, protective advances, and application of payments, rental 
proceeds, and security proceeds, including a running outstanding balance 
total; and
    (iv) Documentation, as requested by the Agency, concerning the 
lender's compliance with the requirements of this part.
    (5) The Agency will notify the lender of any discrepancies in the 
final loss claim or, approve or reject the claim within 40 days.
    (6) The Agency will reduce a final loss claim based on its 
calculation of the dollar amount of loss caused by the lender's 
negligent servicing of the account. Loss claims may be reduced or 
rejected as a result of the following:
    (i) A loss claim may be reduced by the amount caused by the lender's 
failure to secure property after a default, and will be reduced by the 
amount of interest that accrues when the lender fails to contact the 
borrower or takes no action to cure the default, once it occurs. Losses 
incurred as a result of interest accrual during excessive delays in 
collection, as determined by the Agency, will not be paid.
    (ii) Unauthorized release of security proceeds, failure to verify 
ownership or possession of security to be purchased, or failure to 
inspect collateral as often required so as to ensure its maintenance.
    (7) Losses will not be reduced for the following:
    (i) Servicing deficiencies that did not contribute materially to the 
dollar amount of the loss.
    (ii) Unaccounted security, as long as the lender's efforts to locate 
and recover the missing collateral was equal to that which would have 
been expended in the case of an unguaranteed loan in the lender's 
portfolio.
    (8) Default interest, late charges, and loan servicing fees are not 
payable under the loss claim.
    (9) The final loss will be the remaining outstanding balance after 
application of the estimated loss payment and the application of 
proceeds from the liquidation of the security.
    (10) If the final loss is less than the estimated loss, the lender 
will reimburse the Agency for the overpayment, plus interest at the note 
rate from the date of the estimated loss payment.

[[Page 264]]

    (11) The lender will return the original guarantee marked paid after 
receipt of a final loss claim.
    (j) Future Recovery. The lender will remit any recoveries made on 
the account after the Agency's payment of a final loss claim to the 
Agency in proportion to the percentage of guarantee, in accordance with 
the lender's agreement, until the account is paid in full or otherwise 
satisfied.
    (k) Overpayments. The lender will repay any final loss overpayment 
determined by the Agency upon request.
    (l) Electronic funds transfer. The lender will designate one or more 
financial institutions to which any Agency payments will be made via 
electronic funds transfer.
    (m) Establishment of Federal debt. Any amounts paid by the Agency on 
account of liabilities of the guaranteed loan borrower will constitute a 
Federal debt owing to the Agency by the guaranteed loan borrower. In 
such case, the Agency may use all remedies available to it, including 
offset under the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, to collect the 
debt from the borrower. Interest charges will be established at the note 
rate of the guaranteed loan on the date the final loss claim is paid.

<R05>
Sec. 762.150  Interest assistance program.

    (a) Requests for interest assistance. (1) To apply for interest 
assistance in conjunction with a new request for guarantee, the lender 
will submit the following:
    (i) A completed cash flow budget and interest assistance needs 
analysis portion of the application form. Interest assistance can be 
applied to each loan, only to one loan or any distribution the lender 
selects; however, interest assistance is only available on as many loans 
as necessary to achieve a feasible plan.
    (ii) For loans with unequal payments, a proposed debt repayment 
schedule which shows principal and interest payments for the subject 
loan, in each year of the loan.
    (2) To request interest assistance on an existing guaranteed loan, 
the lender must submit to the Agency the following:
    (i) A completed cash flow projection and interest assistance needs 
analysis portion of the application form. Interest assistance can be 
applied to each loan, only to one loan or any distribution the lender 
selects as required to achieve a feasible plan.
    (ii) For loans with unequal payments, a proposed debt repayment 
schedule which shows scheduled payments for the subject loan in each of 
the remaining years of the loan.
    (iii) Cash flow budgets and supporting justification to document 
that the request meets the requirements outlined in paragraph (b) of 
this section. This will include a typical cash flow if the projected 
cash flow budget is atypical.
    (3) Requests for interest assistance on lines of credit or loans 
made for annual operating purposes must be accompanied by a projected 
monthly cash flow budget.
    (b) Requirements. (1) The typical term of scheduled loan repayment 
will not be reduced solely for the purpose of maximizing eligibility for 
interest assistance. To be eligible for interest assistance, a loan must 
be scheduled over the maximum terms typically used by lenders for 
similar type loans within the limits set by Sec. 762.124 of this part. 
At a minimum, loans will be scheduled for repayment over the terms 
listed below, but for OL not to exceed the life of the security:
    (i) An OL for the purpose of providing annual operating and living 
expenses will be scheduled for repayment when the income is scheduled to 
be received from the sale of the crops, livestock, and livestock 
products which will serve as security for the loan.
    (ii) OL for purposes other than annual operating and living expenses 
(i.e. equipment, livestock, refinancing of existing debt) will be 
scheduled over 7 years from the effective date of the proposed interest 
assistance agreement.
    (iii) FO and SW secured by real estate will be scheduled for 20 
years from the closing date of the original note covered by the 
guarantee.
    (2) The lender must document that a feasible plan, as defined in 
Sec. 762.102(b), is not possible without reducing the interest rate on 
the borrower's loan and

[[Page 265]]

with the debt restructured over the term of repayment.
    (3) The lender must determine whether the borrower, including 
members of an entity, owns any significant assets that do not contribute 
directly to essential family living or farm operations. The lender must 
determine the market value of these assets and prepare a cash flow 
budget based on the assumption that the value of these assets will be 
used for debt reduction. If a feasible plan can then be achieved, the 
borrower is not eligible for interest assistance. All interest 
assistance calculations will be based on the cash flow budget which 
assumes that the assets will be sold.
    (4) A borrower's new guaranteed loan is eligible for interest 
assistance if all the following conditions are met:
    (i) The applicant needs interest assistance in order to achieve a 
feasible plan.
    (ii) If significant changes in the borrower's cash flow budget are 
anticipated after the initial 12 months, then the typical cash flow 
budget must demonstrate that the borrower will still have a feasible 
plan, following the anticipated changes, with or without interest 
assistance.
    (iii) If a feasible plan cannot be achieved, even with other 
creditors voluntarily adjusting their debts and with the interest 
assistance, the interest assistance request will not be approved.
    (5) An existing guaranteed loan is eligible for interest assistance 
if the borrower needs interest assistance to achieve a feasible plan as 
defined in Sec. 762.102(b), and the borrower meets the eligibility 
criteria of Sec. 762.120, except the provision regarding prior debt 
forgiveness. If a feasible plan cannot be achieved, even with other 
creditors voluntarily adjusting their debts and with the interest 
assistance, the interest assistance request will not be approved. If a 
borrower has multiple loans, interest assistance may be provided on one 
or each loan, as available, to the extent necessary to achieve a 
feasible plan.
    (6) The term of the interest assistance agreement under this section 
shall not exceed 10 years from the date of the first interest assistance 
agreement signed by the loan applicant, including entity members, or the 
outstanding term of the loan, as limited by this section, whichever is 
less.
    (7) The lender may charge a fixed or variable interest rate. The 
type of rate must be the same as the type of rate in the underlying note 
or line of credit agreement. The lender will reduce the interest rate 
charged the borrower's account by at least the amount of interest 
assistance.
    (8) The borrower must be an operator of not larger than a family 
size farm.
    (c) Interest assistance closing. (1) Initial guaranteed loans will 
be closed in accordance with Sec. 762.130.
    (2) The lender will then prepare and deliver to the Agency a closing 
report for each initial and existing guaranteed loan which has been 
granted interest assistance.
    (3) When all requirements have been met, the lender and the Agency 
will execute an interest assistance agreement.
    (d) Interest assistance claims and payments. (1) The interest 
assistance claim will be prepared by the lender. The following 
conditions apply to the claims process:
    (i) No claim period can exceed 12 months. The initial and final 
claim periods may be less than 12 months. In such claims, the 4 percent 
payment will be prorated over the number of months in the claim period. 
The period for all other claims must be 12 months.
    (ii) To permit the borrower to prepare for the upcoming year, a 
claim should be filed within 60 days of each anniversary date. Claims 
not filed within 1 year of the anniversary date will not be paid and the 
amount due the lender is permanently forfeited.
    (iii) If a claim is submitted without an interest assistance review 
in accordance with Sec. 762.102, when it is required, the claim will not 
be processed until the review is submitted by the lender.
    (iv) Upon full payment of the note or line of credit, the lender 
will immediately prepare the request for interest assistance payment and 
submit it to the Agency.
    (v) Interest assistance payments shall cease upon the assumption and 
transfer of the loan if the transferee was not liable for the debt on 
the effective date of the interest assistance agreement. The lender 
shall request

[[Page 266]]

payment through the date of the transfer or assumption. The claim must 
be submitted within 1 year or it will be denied and the payment 
permanently forfeited.
    (vi) All claims will be supported by detailed calculations of 
average daily principal balances during the claim period.
    (vii) The Agency will review the claim and the supporting 
documentation. If the information and the supporting documentation is 
not complete and correct, the reviewing official will notify the lender 
in writing, of the actions needed to correct the request.
    (viii) If there is a substitution of lender, a claim for the first 
lender's interest assistance, through the effective date of the 
substitution, will be submitted by the first lender and processed at the 
time of the substitution.
    (ix) Interest assistance claims shall be submitted concurrently with 
the submission of estimated loss claims where interest accrual ceases, 
or final loss claims that are not preceded by an estimated loss claim.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (e) Request for continuation of interest assistance. (1) For all 
interest assistance agreements exceeding 12 months, the lender will 
perform an analysis of the applicant's farming operation and need for 
continued interest assistance. The following information will be 
submitted to the Agency:
    (i) A summary of the operation's actual financial performance in the 
previous year, including a detailed income and expense statement.
    (ii) A narrative description of the causes of any major differences 
between the previous year's projections and actual performance.
    (iii) A current balance sheet.
    (iv) A cash flow budget for the period being planned. A monthly cash 
flow budget is required for all lines of credit and operating loans made 
for annual operating purposes. All other loans may include either an 
annual or monthly cash flow budget.
    (v) A copy of the interest assistance needs analysis portion of the 
application form which has been completed based on the planned period's 
cash flow budget.
    (2) The loan will be eligible for continuation of interest 
assistance if the cash flow budget projects a feasible plan with 
interest assistance applied. However, interest assistance can be applied 
only to as many loans as necessary to achieve a positive cash flow for 
the plan period. If the cash flow budget indicates that the borrower 
requires a level of interest assistance greater than 4 percent to 
project a feasible plan, then the Agency will deny the continuation of 
interest assistance. Interest assistance will be reduced to zero during 
that period. See Sec. 762.102(b) for the definition of feasible plan.
    (3) The documentation listed above will be provided to the Agency 
concurrently with the lender's submission of its request for interest 
assistance payment. This information will be provided to the Agency 
within 60 days after the review date specified on the interest 
assistance agreement.
    (4) A request for continuation of interest assistance will be 
completed for 12 month periods, effective on the anniversary date.
    (5) The initial review may be submitted in conjunction with any 
claim within the initial 12 month period. The anniversary date and 
length of the review period will be stated on the interest assistance 
agreement. Any request for interest assistance adjustment submitted 
effective any time other than the review date will be denied, except for 
those cases where it is necessary to service the loan with rescheduling, 
reamortization, deferral or writedown.
    (6) If the review is not completed and submitted to the Agency 
within 1 year of the review date, no claim will be paid for that period.
    (f) Notification of Adverse Action. The lender will be notified in 
writing of all Agency decisions in which a request for interest 
assistance, a request for continuation of interest assistance or 
lender's claim for interest assistance are denied. The notification 
letter will provide specific reasons for the decision and appeals will 
be handled in accordance with parts 11 and 780 of this title.
    (g) Servicing of loans covered by an interest assistance agreement.

[[Page 267]]

    (1) Loans covered by interest assistance agreements cannot be 
consolidated.
    (2) The loan will be transferred with the interest assistance 
agreement only in cases where the transferee was liable for the debt at 
the time interest assistance was granted. Under no other circumstances 
will the interest assistance be transferred. If interest assistance is 
necessary for the transferee to achieve a feasible plan, the lender may 
request such assistance, which may be approved if interest assistance 
funds are available and the applicant is eligible. The maximum length of 
the agreement will be 10 years from the date of the first agreement 
covering a loan for which the transferee was liable. If interest 
assistance is necessary for a feasible plan and funds are not available, 
the request for assumption of the Agency guaranteed debt will be denied.
    (3) When consideration is given to using a debt writedown to service 
a delinquent account, the subsidy level will be recalculated prior to 
any writedown. If a feasible plan can be obtained using interest 
assistance and funds are available, then the interest assistance will be 
authorized and no writedown will be approved. If a feasible plan cannot 
be achieved using 4 percent interest assistance, all further 
calculations for determining debt writedown eligibility and amounts to 
be written down will be based on the borrower receiving no interest 
assistance. If debt writedown is approved, the interest assistance claim 
for the previous review period will be processed in conjunction with the 
writedown loss claim. The interest assistance agreement will not be 
canceled and the anniversary date can remain the same or be re-
established under the same guidelines that it was originally 
established. If the lender determines through its annual analysis that 
interest assistance is necessary for a feasible plan, a request to 
reinstate the subsidy in a subsequent review period may be submitted in 
accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
    (4) In the event of rescheduling or deferral of loans with interest 
assistance, interest assistance will remain available for that loan 
under the terms of the existing interest assistance agreement. 
Additional years of interest assistance and/or increases in the 
restructured loan amount will require additional funding. If the 
additional interest assistance is needed in order to produce a feasible 
plan throughout the life of the rescheduled loan and funds are not 
available for the additional interest assistance, then the rescheduling 
will not be approved by the Agency. In no case will the subsidy be 
extended more than 10 years from the effective date of the first 
interest assistance agreement signed by the loan applicant or by anyone 
who signed the note or line of credit agreement.
    (5) In cases where the interest on a loan covered by an interest 
assistance agreement is reduced by court order in a reorganization plan 
under the bankruptcy code, interest assistance agreement will be 
terminated effective on the date of the court ordered interest 
reduction. The lender will file a claim due through the effective date 
of the court ordered interest reduction. Guaranteed loans which have had 
their interest reduced by bankruptcy court order are not eligible to 
receive interest assistance.
    (6) For Loan Guarantees held by holders, Agency purchase of the 
guaranteed portion of a loan will stop interest assistance payments on 
that portion. Interest assistance payments will cease upon termination 
of the Loan Guarantee, upon reaching the expiration date contained in 
the agreement or upon cancellation by the Agency.
    (7) When a borrower defaults on a loan, interest assistance may be 
considered in conjunction with a rescheduling action in accordance with 
Sec. 762.145(b). After the meeting required by Sec. 762.143(b)(3) and 
consideration of actions to correct the delinquency, the lender will 
notify the Agency of the results of the meeting. If the restructuring 
proposal includes interest assistance, the lender will provide the items 
required by paragraph (d) of this section in addition to those items 
required by Sec. 762.145. Liquidation must not be initiated, except in 
accordance with Sec. 762.143(b)(3)(v).
    (h) Cancellation of interest assistance agreement. The interest 
assistance agreement is incontestable except for fraud or 
misrepresentation, of which

[[Page 268]]

the lender and borrower have actual knowledge at the time that the 
interest assistance agreement is executed, or which the lender or 
borrower participates in or condones.
    (i) Adjustment of assistance level between review dates. After the 
initial or renewal request for interest assistance is processed, no 
adjustments can be made until the next review or adjustment date except 
when necessary to service the loan with a rescheduling or deferral.
    (j) Excessive interest assistance. Upon written notice to the 
lender, borrower and any holder, the Agency may amend or cancel the 
interest assistance agreement and collect from the lender any amount of 
interest Assistance granted which resulted from incomplete or inaccurate 
information, an error in computation, or any other reason which resulted 
in payment that the lender was not entitled to receive.
    (k) The Deputy Administrator for Farm Loan Programs has the 
authority to grant an exception to any requirement involving interest 
Assistance if it is in the best interest of the Government.

    (3) Family farm and nonfarm enterprise. The applicant's farming 
operation must qualify as a family farm and must not be a nonfarm 
enterprise.
    (4) Established farmer. An applicant must be an established farmer.
    (5) Owner and operator requirements.
    (i) Loans for physical losses to real estate. In the case of a loan 
for a purpose specified in Sec. 764.3(a)(1), an applicant must be:
    (A) The owner and operator of the farming operation; or
    (B) An operator of the farming operation whose lease on the affected

[[Page 274]]

    (i) If the owners holding a majority interest in the entity 
applicant are related by blood or marriage, at least one of such related 
owners must operate the family farm.
    (ii) If the owners holding a majority interest in the entity 
applicant are not related by blood or marriage, the majority interest 
holders must all operate the family farm.
    (iii) If the entity applicant has an operator interest in any other 
farming operation, that farming operation must not exceed the 
requirements of a family farm.
    (7) Intent to continue farming. The applicant must demonstrate the 
intent to continue the farm operation after the disaster.
    (8) Credit history. The applicant must demonstrate a credit history 
satisfactory to the Agency. As part of the credit history the Agency 
will determine whether the applicant has dealt with the Agency in good 
faith. This includes the applicant providing current, complete, and 
truthful information when applying for assistance and in all past 
dealings with the Agency. The Agency will also examine whether the 
applicant has properly fulfilled its obligations to other parties, 
including other Federal agencies. The Agency may use credit reports or 
any other available information to evaluate credit history.
    (9) Availability of credit elsewhere. The applicant must be unable 
to obtain sufficient credit elsewhere at reasonable rates and terms. To 
establish this, the applicant must obtain written declinations of credit 
from legally organized commercial lending institutions within reasonable 
proximity of the applicant that specify the reasons for the declination 
as follows:
    (i) In the case of a loan for $300,000 or more, two written 
declinations of credit are required;
    (ii) In the case of a loan of less than $300,000, one written 
declination of credit is required; and
    (iii) In the case of a loan of $100,000 or less, the Agency may 
waive the requirement for obtaining a written declination of credit if 
the Agency determines that it would pose an undue burden on the 
applicant, the applicant certifies that they cannot get credit 
elsewhere, and based on the applicant's circumstances credit is not 
likely to be available;
    (iv) Notwithstanding the applicant's submission of the required 
written declinations of credit, the Agency may contact other commercial 
lending institutions within reasonable proximity of the applicant and 
make an independent determination of the applicant's ability to obtain 
credit elsewhere.
    (10) Prior debt forgiveness. The applicant must not have received 
debt forgiveness from the Agency on more than one occasion on or before 
April 4, 1996, or any time after April 4, 1996.

subject to a Federal judgment lien (other than a United States Tax Court 
lien).
    (12) Managerial ability. The applicant must have sufficient 
managerial ability to assure reasonable prospects of loan repayment, as 
determined by the Agency. The applicant must demonstrate this managerial 
ability by education, on-the-job training, or farming experience within 
the last 5 years that covers an entire production cycle.
    (13) Borrower training. The applicant must agree to meet the 
borrower training requirements in accordance with Sec. 1924.74 of this 
title.
    (14) Prior drug convictions. The applicant cannot have been 
convicted under Federal or State law of planting, cultivating, growing, 
producing, harvesting, or storing a controlled substance, as defined in 
21 CFR part 1308, during the current crop year or the previous 4 crop 
years.
    (15) Recovery of duplicative benefits. The applicant must agree to 
repay any duplicative Federal assistance to the agency providing such 
assistance. A person receiving Federal assistance for a major disaster 
or emergency is liable to the United States to the extent that the 
assistance duplicates benefits available to the person for the same 
purpose from another source.
    (b) Additional Emergency loan eligibility requirements--(1) Timely 
loan application. A loan application must be received by the Agency not 
later than 8 months after the date the disaster is declared or 
designated in the county of the applicant's farming operation.

[[Page 275]]

    (2) Qualifying losses--(i) Loss must occur in a disaster area. The 
applicant may seek an Emergency loan only with respect to a family farm 
that had production or physical losses as a result of a disaster in a 
disaster area.
    (ii) Eligible production loss. For production loss loans, the 
applicant must have a disaster yield that is at least 30 percent below 
the normal production yield of any single crop, as determined by the 
Agency, that comprises a basic part of an applicant's total farming 
operation.
    (iii) Eligible physical loss. For physical loss loans, the applicant 
must have suffered disaster-related damage to chattel or real estate 
essential to the farming operation, to household items that must be 
repaired or replaced, to harvested or stored crops, or to perennial 
crops.
    (3) Changes in ownership structure. The ownership structure of a 
family farm may change between the time of a qualifying loss and the 
time an Emergency loan is closed. In such case, all of the following 
requirements must be met:
    (i) The applicant, in its new form, including all owners must meet 
all applicable eligibility requirements contained in this section;
    (ii) The new individual applicant, or all owners of a new entity 
applicant must have had an ownership interest in the farming operation 
at the time of the disaster; and
    (iii) The amount of the loan will be based on the percentage of the 
former farming operation transferred to the new applicant and in no 
event will the individual portions, aggregated, equal more than would 
have been authorized for the former farming operation.
    (4) Insurance requirement. Emergency loan funds may not be used for 
physical loss purposes (excluding losses to livestock) unless that 
physical property was covered by general hazard insurance at the time 
that the damage caused by the natural disaster occurred. The level of 
the coverage in effect at the time of the disaster must have been the 
tax or cost depreciated value, whichever is less. Chattel property must 
have been covered at the tax or cost depreciated value, whichever is 
less, when such insurance was readily available and the benefits of the 
coverage (i.e. the amount of coverage equaling the lesser of the 
property's tax or cost depreciated value) justify the cost of the 
insurance.


<R05>
Sec. 764.5  Limitations.

    (a) General limitations--(1) Highly erodible soil and wetlands 
conservation. The Agency will not make a loan under this part for any 
purpose that contributes to erosion of highly-erodible land or the 
conversion of wetlands to produce an agricultural commodity.
    (2) Construction. Any construction financed by the Agency must 
comply with applicable Federal, State, local, and industry building 
standards and subpart A of part 1924 of this title.
    (3) Refinancing. Emergency loan funds may not be used to refinance 
consumer debt, such as automobile loans, or credit card debt unless such 
credit card debt is directly attributable to the farming operation.
    (b) Restriction on loan amount. An Emergency loan may not exceed the 
lesser of:
    (1) The amount of credit necessary to restore the family farming 
operation to its pre-disaster condition;
    (2) In the case of a physical loss loan, the total eligible physical 
losses caused by the disaster; or
    (3) In the case of a production loss loan, 100 percent of the total 
actual production loss sustained by the applicant calculated pursuant to 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (c) Maximum cumulative loan principal. The maximum cumulative 
Emergency loan principal that any individual or entity may have 
outstanding is $500,000.
    (d) Production losses. The applicant's actual production loss with 
respect to a crop is calculated as follows:
    (1) Subtract the applicant's disaster yield from the applicant's 
normal production yield to determine the applicant's per acre production 
loss;
    (2) Multiply the applicant's per acre production loss by the number 
of acres of the farming operation devoted to the crop to determine the 
volume of the production loss;
    (3) Multiply the volume of the applicant's production loss by the 
market price for such crop as determined by

[[Page 276]]

the Agency to determine the dollar value for the production loss; and
    (4) Subtract any other disaster related compensation or insurance 
indemnities received or to be received by the applicant for the 
production loss.
    (e) Physical loss--(1) Amount of loss. The applicant's total 
eligible physical loss is calculated as follows:
    (i) Add the allowable costs associated with replacing or repairing 
chattel covered by hazard insurance (excluding labor, machinery, 
equipment, or materials contributed by the applicant to repair or 
replace chattel);
    (ii) Add the allowable costs associated with repairing or replacing 
real estate, covered by hazard insurance;
    (iii) Add the value of livestock and livestock products (such 
valuation will be based on a national or regional valuation of species 
or product classification, whichever the Agency determines is more 
accurate);
    (iv) Add the allowable costs to restore perennials, which produce an 
agricultural commodity, to the stage of development the damaged 
perennials had obtained prior to the disaster;
    (v) Add, in the case of an applicant that is an individual, the 
allowable costs associated with repairing or replacing essential 
household contents, not to exceed $20,000; and
    (vi) Subtract any other disaster-related compensation or insurance 
indemnities received or to be received by the applicant for the loss or 
damage to the chattel or real estate.
    (2) Documentation. In the case of physical losses associated with 
livestock, the applicant must have written documentation of the 
inventory of livestock and records of livestock product sales sufficient 
to allow the Agency to value such livestock or livestock products just 
prior to the loss.


<R05>
Sec. 764.6  Interest rate.

    The interest rate applicable for an Emergency loan will be the lower 
of the interest rate at the time of either loan approval or loan closing 
and in no event shall exceed 8 percent annually.


<R05>
Sec. 764.7  Loan terms.

    (a) Basis for repayment. The Agency schedules repayment of Emergency 
loans based on the useful life of the loan security, the applicant's 
repayment ability, and the type of loss.
    (b) Minimum payment requirement. The repayment schedule must include 
at least one payment every year.
    (c) Repayment of loans for annual operating expenses. Emergency 
loans for annual operating expenses, except those expenses associated 
with establishing a perennial crop, must be repaid within 12 months. The 
Agency, however, may extend this term to not more than 18 months to 
accommodate the production cycle of the agricultural commodities of the 
farming operation.
    (d) Repayment of loans for production or physical losses to chattel. 
The repayment schedule for loans for production losses or physical 
losses to chattel (including but not limited to assets with an expected 
life between 1 and 7 years) may not exceed 7 years. If necessary to 
improve the repayment ability of the loan and real estate security is 
available, the term of the loan may be extended up to a total length not 
to exceed 20 years.
    (e) Repayment of loans for physical losses to real estate. The 
repayment schedule for loans for physical losses to real estate is based 
on repayment ability of the applicant and the useful life of the 
security, but in no case will the term of repayment exceed 40 years.


<R05>
Sec. 764.8  Repayment and security requirements.

    (a) General requirements--(1) Ability to repay. The applicant must 
submit a feasible plan that demonstrates the applicant's ability to 
repay the loan. The plan also must demonstrate that the applicant will 
meet all other credit needs and obligations, including judgments, for 
which the applicant is legally responsible.
    (2) Sufficient equity. The applicant must have sufficient equity in 
the security pledged for an Emergency loan to provide adequate security 
for the loan except as permitted in paragraph (f) of this section. The 
applicant must provide additional security, if available, not to exceed 
150 percent of the loan amount.
    (3) Interests in property not owned by the applicant. Interests in 
property not owned by the applicant (such as leases that provide a 
mortgageable value,

[[Page 277]]

water rights, easements, mineral rights, and royalties) can be offered 
as security for the loan and will be considered in determining whether 
adequate security is available.
    (b) Real estate loans. In the case of an Emergency loan for real 
estate losses, the loan shall be secured at a minimum by the real estate 
that is being purchased, repaired, replaced, or improved with the loan 
funds.
    (c) Chattel and production loans. In the case of an Emergency loan 
for chattel and production losses, the loan shall be secured, at a 
minimum, by the chattel that is being purchased, repaired, replaced, 
refinanced, or produced with the loan funds.
    (d) Agency lien position--(1) Real estate security. If real estate 
is pledged as security for a loan, the Agency must obtain a first lien, 
if available, on the real estate. When a first lien is not available, 
the Agency may take a junior lien under the following conditions:
    (i) The prior lien does not contain any provision that may 
jeopardize the Agency's interest or the applicant's ability to repay the 
loan to the Agency;
    (ii) Prior lienholders agree to notify the Agency of acceleration 
and foreclosure whenever State law or other arrangements do not require 
such notice; and
    (iii) The applicant must agree to obtain permission from the Agency 
prior to granting any additional security interests in the real estate.
    (2) Real estate held under a purchase contract. If the real estate 
offered as security is held under a recorded purchase contract:
    (i) The applicant must provide a security interest in the real 
estate;
    (ii) The applicant and the purchase contract holder must agree in 
writing that any insurance proceeds received to compensate for real 
estate losses will be used only to replace or repair the damaged real 
estate;
    (iii) The applicant must refinance the existing purchase contract, 
or demonstrate that financing is not available, if an acceptable 
contract of sale cannot be negotiated or the purchase contract holder 
refuses to agree to apply all the insurance proceeds to repair or 
replace the damaged real estate and wants to retain some of the proceeds 
as an extra payment on the balance owed;
    (iv) The purchase contract must not be subject to summary 
cancellation on default and must not contain any provisions that are 
contrary to the Agency's best interests; and
    (v) The contract holder must agree in writing to notify the Agency 
of any breach by the purchaser, and give the Agency the option to 
rectify the conditions that amount to a breach within 30 days after the 
date the Agency receives written notice of the breach.
    (3) Chattel security. If chattel property is pledged as security for 
a loan the Agency must obtain a first lien on the chattel that is being 
purchased, repaired, replaced, refinanced, or produced with the loan 
funds.
    (e) Same security for multiple loans. The same property may be 
pledged as security for more than one Farm Loan Program loan.
    (f) Lack of adequate security. When adequate security is not 
available because of the disaster, the loan application may be approved 
if the Agency determines, based on the plan required in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section, that there is a reasonable assurance that the applicant 
has the ability to repay the loan (based on an on-going operational 
basis, excluding special one-time sources of income or expenses) 
provided:
    (1) The applicant has pledged as collateral for the loan, all 
available personal and business collateral, except those items listed in 
paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2) of this section;
    (2) The feasible plan, approved by the Agency, indicates the loan 
will be repaid based upon the applicant's production and income history 
and addresses applicable pricing risks through the use of marketing 
contracts, hedging, options, revenue insurance or similar risk 
management practices;
    (3) The applicant has had positive net cash farm income in at least 
3 of the past 5 years; and
    (4) The applicant has given the Agency an assignment on any USDA 
program payments to be received.
    (g) Conditions for taking other assets as security--(1) Conditions. 
In addition to

[[Page 278]]

the requirements for adequate and additional security, the Agency will 
take a security interest in other assets (other than assets listed under 
the exceptions in paragraph (h) of this section), if available, when:
    (i) An applicant has non-essential assets that are not being 
converted to cash to reduce the loan amount; or
    (ii) The real estate security and chattel security do not provide 
adequate security for the loan.
    (2) List of other assets. Other assets may include:
    (i) A pledge of real estate or chattel by a third party;
    (ii) Patents, copyrights, life insurance, stocks, other securities, 
and membership in cooperatives, owned by the applicant;
    (iii) Assets owned by an applicant that cannot be converted to cash 
without jeopardizing the farm operation; and
    (iv) Non-essential assets owned by the applicant with an aggregate 
value in excess of $5,000.
    (h) Exceptions to security requirements. The Agency will not take a 
security interest in certain property in the following situations:
    (1) The property proposed as security has environmental 
contamination, restrictions, or historical impact that could impair the 
value or expose the Agency to potential liability;
    (2) The Agency cannot obtain a valid lien on the security;
    (3) The applicant's personal residence and appurtenances are on a 
parcel of land separate and apart from that real estate being used as 
adequate security for the loan; or
    (4) The applicant's other assets are used for farming or for 
essential living expenses and are not needed for security purposes, 
including but not limited to, subsistence livestock, cash or special 
cash collateral accounts, retirement accounts, personal vehicles, 
household goods, and small tools and equipment such as hand tools, power 
lawn mowers.
    (i) Requirements for security. (1) For loans over $25,000, title 
clearance is required when real estate is taken as security.
    (2) For loans of $25,000 or less, when real estate is taken as 
security, a certification of ownership in real estate is required. 
Certification of ownership may be in the form of an affidavit which is 
signed by the applicant, naming the record owner of the real estate in 
question and listing the balances due on all known debts against the 
real estate. Whenever the loan approving official is uncertain of the 
record owner or debts against the real estate security, a title search 
is required.
    (j) Taking Indian Trust lands as security. The Agency may take a 
lien on Indian Trust lands as security provided that the requirements of 
Sec. 1943.19(a)(7) of this title are satisfied.


<R05>
Sec. 764.9  Appraisal and valuation requirements.

    (a) Establishing value for real estate. Real estate appraisals 
conducted pursuant to this part may be completed by designated 
appraisers or contract appraisers and shall conform to the Uniform 
Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice guidelines and standards in 
accordance with Sec. 761.7 of this chapter.
    (b) Establishing value for agricultural commodities and equipment. 
Valuations of agricultural commodities and equipment shall be 
established as follows:
    (1) The security value of the annual agricultural commodities 
production (excluding livestock) will be 100 percent of the amount 
loaned for annual operating and essential family household expenses, or 
the amount of expected crop revenue, excluding farm program and 
insurance payments, whichever is lower.
    (2) The value of livestock and equipment will be the market value as 
determined by the Agency in accordance with Sec. 761.7 of this chapter.
    (c) Assets damaged by the disaster. In the case of farm assets 
damaged by the disaster, the value of such security shall be established 
as of the day before the disaster occurred.

<R05>
Sec. 764.10  Insurance for loan security.

    (a) Adequacy of insurance. An applicant must obtain insurance, 
consistent with this section, equal to the lesser of the value of the 
security at the time of

[[Page 279]]

loan closing, or the principal of the loan.
    (b) Hazard insurance. All security (except growing crops) must be 
covered by hazard insurance if it is readily available (i.e. sold by 
insurance agents in the applicants normal trade area) and economically 
feasible.
    (c) Flood or mudslide insurance. Real estate security located in 
flood or mudslide prone areas, as determined by the Agency, must be

loan, the applicant must have obtained at least the catastrophic risk 
protection level of crop insurance coverage for the crop during the crop 
year for which the loan is sought for each crop which is a basic part of 
an applicant's total farming operation, if such insurance is available, 
unless the applicant executes a written waiver of any emergency crop 
loss assistance with respect to such crop.
    (2) Exception. Growing crops used to provide adequate security must 
be covered by crop insurance if such insurance is available.
    (e) Indemnities. A borrower must:
    (1) List the Agency as loss payee for the insurance indemnity 
payment or as a beneficiary of a mortgagee loss payable clause; and

reamortization of a loan provided:
    (i) The borrower submits a completed Agency application form; and
    (ii) The account is delinquent due to circumstances beyond the 
borrower's control and cannot be brought current within 1 year; or
    (iii) The account is current, but due to circumstances beyond the 
borrower's control, the borrower will be unable to meet the annual loan 
payments.
    (2) Terms. The term of a loan may not be extended beyond 40 years 
from the date of the original note.
    (i) Reamortization within the remaining term of the loan will be 
predicated on a projection of the tribe's operating expenses indicating 
the ability to meet the new payment schedule; and
    (ii) No intervening lien exists on the security for the loan which 
would jeopardize the Government's security priority.
    (3) Consolidation of notes. If one or more notes are to be 
reamortized, consolidation of the notes is authorized.
    (b) Interest rate reduction. The Agency may consider a reduction of 
the interest rate for an existing loan to the current interest rate as 
available from any Agency office provided:
    (1) The borrower submits a completed Agency application form;
    (2) The loan was made more than 5 years prior to the application for

    (d) Land exchanges. In the cases where a borrower proposes to 
exchange any portion of land securing a loan for other land, title 
clearance and a new mortgage on the land received by the borrower in 
exchange, which adequately secures the unpaid principal balance of the 
loan, will be required unless the Agency determines any remaining land 
or other loan security is adequate security for the loan.
    (e) Debt write-down.
    (1) Application. The Agency will consider debt write-down under 
either the land value option or rental value option, as requested by the 
borrower.
    (i) The borrower must submit a completed Agency application form;
    (ii) If the borrower applies and is determined eligible for a land 
value and a rental value write-down, the borrower will receive a write-
down based on the write-down option that provides the greatest debt 
reduction.
    (2) Eligibility. To be eligible for debt write-down, the borrower 
(in the case of a tribal corporation, the Native American tribe of the 
borrower) must:
    (i) Be located in a county which is identified as a persistent 
poverty county by the United States Department of Agriculture, Economic 
Research Service pursuant to the most recent data from the Bureau of the

    (3) Land value write-down. The Agency may reduce the unpaid 
principal and interest balance on any loan made to the current market 
value of the land that was purchased with loan funds provided:
    (i) The market value of such land has declined by at least 25 
percent since the land was purchased as established by a current 
appraisal;
    (ii) Land value decrease is not attributed to the depletion of 
resources contained on or under the land;
    (iii) The loan was made more than 5 years prior to the application 
for land value writedown; and
    (iv) The loan has not previously been written down under paragraph 
(e)(4) of this section and has not been written down within the last 5 
years under this paragraph.
    (4) Rental value write-down. The Agency may reduce the unpaid 
principal and interest on any loan, so the annual loan payment for the 
remaining term of each loan equals the average of annual rental value of 
the land purchased by each such loan for the immediately preceding 5-
year period provided:
    (i) The loan was made more than 5 years prior to the rental value 
writedown;
    (ii) The description of the land purchased with the loan funds and

    This part contains the terms and conditions for loans made under the 
Special Apple Loan Program. These regulations are applicable to

producers of apples suffering from economic loss as a result of low 
apple prices.


<R05>

    Agency is the Farm Service Agency, its employees, and any successor 
agency.
    Apple producer is a farmer in the United States or its territories 
that produced apples, on not less than 10 acres, for sale in 1999 or 
2000.
    Applicant is the individual or business entity applying for the 
loan.
    Business entity is a corporation, partnership, joint operation, 
trust, limited liability company, or cooperative.
    Cash flow budget is a projection listing all anticipated cash 
inflows (including all farm income, nonfarm income and all loan 
advances) and all cash outflows (including all farm and nonfarm debt 
service and other expenses) to be incurred by the borrower during the 
period of the budget. A cash flow budget may be completed either for a 
12 month period, a typical production cycle or the life of the loan, as 
appropriate.
    Domestically owned enterprise is an entity organized in the United 
States under the law of the state or states in which the entity operates 
and a majority of the entity is owned by members meeting the citizenship 
test.
    False information is information provided by an applicant, borrower,

to be incorrect, and was given to the Agency in order to obtain benefits 
for which the applicant or borrower would not otherwise have been 
eligible.
    Feasible plan is a plan that demonstrates that the loan will be 
repaid as agreed, as determined by the Agency.

[[Page 287]]

    Security is real or personal property pledged as collateral to 
assure repayment of a loan in the event there is a default on the loan.
    USPAP is Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice.


<R05>
Sec. 773.3  Appeals.

    A loan applicant or borrower may request an appeal or review of an 
adverse decision made by the Agency in accordance with 7 CFR part 11.


<R05>
Secs. 773.4-773.5  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 773.6  Eligibility requirements.

    Loan applicants must meet all of the following requirements to be 
eligible for a Special Apple Program Loan:
    (a) The loan applicant must be an apple producer;
    (b) The loan applicant must be a citizen of the United States or an 
alien lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence 
under the Immigration and Nationalization Act. For a business entity 
applicant, the majority of the business entity must be owned by members 
meeting the citizenship test or, other entities that are domestically 
owned. Aliens must provide the appropriate Immigration and 
Naturalization Service forms to document their permanent residency;
    (c) The loan applicant and anyone who will execute the promissory 
note must possess the legal capacity to enter into contracts, including 
debt instruments;
    (d) At loan closing the loan applicant and anyone who will execute 
the promissory note must not be delinquent on any Federal debt, other 
than a debt under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;
    (e) At loan closing the loan applicant and anyone who will execute 
the promissory note must not have any outstanding unpaid judgments 
obtained by the United States in any court. Such judgments do not 
include those filed as a result of action in the United States Tax 
Courts;
    (f) The loan applicant, in past or present dealings with the Agency, 
must not have provided the Agency with false information; and
    (g) The individual or business entity loan applicant and all entity 
members must have acceptable credit history demonstrated by debt 
repayment. A history of failure to repay past debts as they came due 
(including debts to the Internal Revenue Service) when the ability to 
repay was within their control will demonstrate unacceptable credit 
history. Unacceptable credit history will not include isolated instances 
of late payments which do not represent a pattern and were clearly 
beyond the applicant's control or lack of credit history.


<R05>
Sec. 773.7  Loan uses.

    Loan funds may be used for any of the following purposes related to 
the production or marketing of apples:
    (a) Payment of costs associated with reorganizing a farm to improve 
its profitability;
    (b) Payment of annual farm operating expenses;
    (c) Purchase of farm equipment or fixtures;
    (d) Acquiring, enlarging, or leasing a farm;
    (e) Making capital improvements to a farm;
    (f) Refinancing indebtedness;
    (g) Purchase of cooperative stock for credit, production, processing 
or marketing purposes; or
    (h) Payment of loan closing costs.


<R05>
Sec. 773.8  Limitations.

    (a) The maximum loan amount any individual or business entity may 
receive under the Special Apple Loan Program is limited to $500,000.
    (b) The maximum loan is further limited to $300 per acre of apple 
trees in production in 1999 or 2000, whichever is greater.
    (c) Loan funds may not be used to pay expenses incurred for lobbying 
or related activities.
    (d) Loans may not be made for any purpose which contributes to 
excessive erosion of highly erodible land or to the conversion of 
wetlands to produce an agricultural commodity.


<R05>
Sec. 773.9  Environmental compliance.

    (a) Except as otherwise specified in this section, prior to approval 
of any loan, an environmental evaluation will be completed by the Agency 
to determine if the proposed action will have

[[Page 288]]

any adverse impacts on the human environment and cultural resources. 
Loan applicants will provide all information necessary for the Agency to 
make its evaluation.
    (b) The following loan actions were reviewed for the purpose of 
compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 40 CFR 
parts 1500 through 1508, and determined not to have a significant impact 
on the quality of the human environment, either individually or 
cumulatively. Therefore the following loan actions are categorically 
excluded from the requirements of an environmental evaluation:
    (1) Payment of legal costs associated with reorganizing a farm to 
improve its profitability as long as there will be no changes in the 
land's use or character;
    (2) Purchase of farm equipment which will not be affixed to a 
permanent mount or position;
    (3) Acquiring or leasing a farm;
    (4) Refinancing an indebtedness not greater than $30,000;
    (5) Purchase of stock in a credit association or in a cooperative 
which deals with the production, processing or marketing of apples; and
    (6) Payment of loan closing costs.
    (c) The loan actions listed in paragraph (b) of this section were 
also reviewed in accordance with section 106 of the National Historic 
Preservation Act (NHPA). It was determined that these loan actions are 
non-undertakings with no potential to affect or alter historic 
properties and therefore, will not require consultation with the State 
Historic Preservation Officer, Tribal Historic Preservation Officer, or 
other interested parties.
    (d) If adverse environmental impacts, either direct or indirect, are 
identified, the Agency will complete an environmental assessment in 
accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality's Regulations for 
Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA to the extent required by 
law.
    (e) In order to minimize the financial risk associated with 
contamination of real property from hazardous waste and other 
environmental concerns, the Agency will complete an environmental risk 
evaluation of the environmental risks to the real estate collateral 
posed by the presence of hazardous substances and other environmental 
concerns.
    (1) The Agency will not accept real estate as collateral which has 
significant environmental risks.

<R05>
Sec. 773.19  Interest rate, terms, security requirements, and repayment.

    (a) Interest rate. The interest rate will be fixed for the term of 
the loan. The rate will be established by the Agency and available in 
each Agency Office, based upon the cost of Government borrowing for 
loans of similar maturities.
    (b) Terms. The loan term will be for up to 3 years, based upon the 
useful life of the security offered.
    (c) Security requirements. The Agency will take a lien on the 
following security, if available, as necessary to adequately secure the 
loan:
    (1) Real estate;
    (2) Chattels;
    (3) Crops;
    (4) Other assets owned by the applicant; and
    (5) Assets owned and pledged by a third party.
    (d) Documentation of security value.
    (1) For loans that are for $30,000 or less, collateral value will be 
based on the best available, verifiable information.
    (2) For loans of greater than $30,000 where the applicant's balance 
sheet shows a net worth of three times the loan amount or greater, 
collateral value will be based on tax assessment of real estate and 
depreciation schedules of chattels, as applicable, less any existing 
liens.
    (3) For loans of greater than $30,000 where the applicant's balance 
sheet shows a net worth of less than three times the loan amount, 
collateral value will be based on an appraisal. Such appraisals must be 
obtained by the applicant, at the applicant's expense and acceptable to 
the Agency. Appraisals of real estate must be completed in accordance 
with USPAP.
    (e) Repayment. (1) All loan applicants must demonstrate that the 
loan can be repaid.
    (2) For loans that are for $30,000 or less where the applicant's 
balance sheet shows a net worth of three times the loan amount or 
greater, repayment ability will be considered adequate without further 
documentation.
    (3) For loans that are for $30,000 or less where the applicant's 
balance sheet shows a net worth of less than three times the loan 
amount, repayment ability must be demonstrated using the farm's 
operating plan, including a projected cash flow budget based on 
historical performance. Such operating plan is required notwithstanding 
Sec. 773.18 of this part.
    (4) For loans that are for more than $30,000, repayment ability must 
be demonstrated using the farm's operating plan, including a projected 
cash flow budget based on historical performance.
    (f) Creditworthiness. All loan applicants must have an acceptable 
credit history demonstrated by debt repayment. A history of failure to 
repay past debts as they came due (including debts to the Internal 
Revenue Service) when the ability to repay was within their control will 
demonstrate unacceptable credit history. Unacceptable credit history 
will not include isolated instances of late payments which do not 
represent a pattern and were clearly beyond the applicant's control or 
lack of credit history.


<R05>
Sec. 773.20  Funding applications.

    Loan requests will be funded based on the date the Agency approves

partners and any board members also will be required to execute the 
promissory notes as individuals.
    (c) Fees. The applicant will pay all loan closing fees including 
credit report fees, fees for appraisals, fees for recording any legal 
instruments determined to be necessary, and all notary, lien search, and 
similar fees incident to loan transactions. No fees will be assessed for 
work performed by Agency employees.

<R05>
Sec. 781.5  Penalty review procedure.

    (a) Whenever it appears that a foreign person has violated the 
reporting obligation as described in paragraph (a) of Sec. 781.4, a 
written notice of apparent liability will be sent to the foreign 
person's last known address by the Farm Service Agency. This notice will 
set forth the facts which indicate apparent liability, identify the type 
of violation listed in paragraph (a) of Sec. 781.4 which is involved, 
state the amount of the penalty to be imposed, include a statement of 
fair market value of the foreign person's interest in the subject land, 
and summarize the courses of action available to the foreign person.
    (b) The foreign person involved shall respond to a notice of 
apparent liability within 60 days after the notice is mailed. If a 
foreign person fails to respond to the notice of apparent liability, the 
proposed penalty shall become final. Any of the following actions by the 
foreign person shall constitute a response meeting the requirements of 
this paragraph.
    (1) Payment of the proposed penalty in the amount specified in the 
notice of apparent liability and filing of a report, if required, in 
compliance with Sec. 781.3. The amount shall be paid by check or money

The Department is not responsible for the loss of currency sent through 
the mails.

    (c) After a final decision is issued pursuant to an appeal under 
part 780 of this title, the Administrator or Administrator's designee 
shall mail the foreign person a notice of the determination on appeal, 
stating whether a report must be filed or amended in compliance with 
Sec. 781.3, the amount of the penalty (if any), and the date by which it 
must be paid. The foreign person shall file or amend the report as 
required by the Administrator. The penalty in the amount stated shall be 
paid by check or money order drawn to the Treasurer of the United States 
and shall be mailed to the United States Department of Agriculture, P.O.

    (d) If the foreign person contests the notice of apparent liability 
by submitting a written statement or a request for a hearing thereon, 
the foreign person may elect either to pay the penalty or decline to pay 
the penalty pending resolution of the matter by the Administrator. If 
the Administrator determines that the foreign person is not liable for 
the penalty or is liable for less than the amount paid, the payment will 
be wholly or proportionally refunded. If the Administrator ultimately 
determines that the foreign person is liable, the penalty finally 
imposed shall not exceed the amount imposed in the notice of apparent 
liability.
    (e) If a foreign person fails to respond to the notice of apparent 
liability as required by paragraph (b) of this section, or fails to pay 
the penalty imposed by the Administrator under paragraph (d) of this 
section, the case will, without further notice, be referred by the 
Department to the Department of Justice for prosecution in the 
appropriate District Court to recover the amount of the penalty.

<R05>
Sec. 783.6  Qualifying loss.

    (a) An eligible owner may receive assistance under this part for 
qualifying loss of eligible trees, eligible orchard tree seedlings, 
eligible vines or cuttings as determined by the Deputy Administrator for 
Farm Programs, FSA:
    (1) Which were destroyed or injured as a result of a natural 
disaster, as determined by the county committee in accordance with the 
instructions of the Deputy Administrator; and
    (2) For which the total mortality rate equals or exceeds 20 percent, 
after deducting the normal mortality the owner would have incurred.
    (b) Qualifying loss determinations shall be made on an individual 
stand basis. A qualifying loss shall be the loss for the individual 
stand of eligible trees, or eligible vines, as appropriate, after 
deducting the normal mortality of such trees or vines, equal to or in 
excess of 20 percent mortality.
    (c) Qualifying losses of eligible trees or vines shall not include:
    (1) Losses which could have been prevented through readily-available 
horticultural measures; or

rehabilitated or replanted within the 12-month period following the 
loss, in the absence of the natural disaster.
    (d) When visible evidence of losses no longer exists on the site 
where the eligible trees or eligible vines were planted, acceptable 
evidence as determined in accordance with instructions issued by the 
Deputy Administrator must be established for the county committee to 
qualify the individual stand for the program.


<R05>
Sec. 783.7  Eligible costs.

    (a) Payments will be made only to the extent specifically provided 
for in this part. An eligible owner shall be reimbursed under this part, 
to the extent of the availability of funds, for an amount not to exceed 
100 percent of the eligible costs of replanting or rehabilitating trees 
or vines, not in excess of the number of trees or vines constituting the 
qualifying loss. Such reimbursement may be based on average costs or the 
actual costs for the replanting, or rehabilitating practices, as 
determined by the Deputy Administrator. If the costs are to replace 
eligible trees or eligible vines, the costs reimbursed under this part 
shall only be for replacement seedlings or cuttings of a size and 
quality determined by Deputy Administrator to be sufficient for that 
purpose. The costs for which cost-sharing shall be permitted shall only 
be the costs of:
    (1) The seedlings or cuttings, eligible tree or vine rehabilitation 
measures;
    (2) Site preparation measures and debris handling measures that are 
normal cultural practices for the type of individual stand being re-
established and necessary to ensure successful plant survival;
    (3) Chemicals and nutrients if needed to ensure successful plant 
survival; and
    (4) Labor used to physically plant or rehabilitate such seedlings or 
cuttings as based on standard labor rates as determined by the county 
committee.
    (b) Costs eligible for reimbursement under this part specifically 
exclude items such as fencing, irrigation, irrigation equipment, 
measures to protect seedlings from wildlife, and general land and 
eligible tree or vine stand improvements, and re-establishing structures 
and windscreens.
    (c) When eligible trees or eligible vines are replanted instead of 
rehabilitated, the types planted may be different than those originally 
planted if the new types have the same general end use as determined by 
the county committee. Payments will be based on the lesser of rates 
established to plant the types actually lost or the cost to establish 
the trees or vines actually used. Eligible costs shall not include costs 
incurred for planting species of

[[Page 314]]

seedlings or cuttings differing significantly from the species of the 
seedlings or cuttings constituting the qualifying loss except as 
approved by the Deputy Administrator. If such substitution is approved, 
eligible costs shall be the lesser of:
    (1) The actual eligible costs incurred; or
    (2) The estimated eligible costs which otherwise would have been 
incurred to replant the species constituting the qualifying loss.
    (d) Costs eligible for reimbursement under this part shall only 
include expenditures approved within the limits set by this part, 
including, but not limited to, those limits set forth in paragraph (a) 
of this section. Eligible costs include costs incurred before an 
application for payment is submitted. Eligible costs shall only include 
those costs for which the eligible owner has submitted documentation 
determined by the county committee to adequately document such costs. 
The county committee shall limit TAP payments for eligible costs at the 
minimum level to re-establish an individual stand, as determined by the 
State committee.
    (e) Payments shall not exceed the lesser of 100 percent of the 
eligible costs actually incurred by an eligible applicant for replanting 
or rehabilitating the qualifying loss, or the average cost to replant or 
rehabilitate the qualifying loss, as determined by the Deputy 
Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 783.8  Application process.

    (a) Applications for payment shall be filed by the eligible owner 
with the local county office and shall contain an estimate by the 
applicant of the number of eligible trees or eligible vines which 
constitute the qualifying loss and the amount of the acreage of the 
individual stands with respect to which the loss was suffered. The 
applicant must provide sufficient evidence of the losses so as to allow 
the county committee to determine qualifying losses.
    (b)(1) The county committee or a designee may conduct field reviews 
to determine the actual qualifying loss and the acreage of individual 
stands with respect to which the loss was suffered. The county committee 
and, if designated by the county committee, the county executive 
director, are authorized, subject to the provisions of this part, to 
approve or disapprove all applications, subject to the limitations and 
conditions of this part, provided the applicant is not a county 
committee member or an FSA employee.
    (2) The State committee shall approve or disapprove applications of 
the county committee members and all FSA employees except applications 
submitted by the State Executive Director, or by a State committee 
member.
    (3) The Deputy Administrator, or a designee, shall approve or 
disapprove applications of State committee members and the State 
Executive Director.
    (4) All applications forwarded to a higher reviewing authority for 
consideration shall be accompanied by committee recommendations. No 
application shall be approved unless the owner meets all eligibility 
requirements. Information furnished by the applicant and any other 
information, including knowledge of the county and State committee 
members concerning the owner's normal operations, shall be taken into 
consideration in making recommendations and approvals. If information 
furnished by the owner is incomplete or ambiguous and sufficient 
information is not otherwise available with respect to the owner's 
farming operations in order to make a determination as to the owner's 
eligibility, the owner's application shall not be approved until 
sufficient additional information is provided by the owner.
    (c) If an owner is eligible to receive payments under this part and 
the catastrophic risk protection crop insurance program (7 CFR part 
402), or the noninsured crop disaster assistance program (7 CFR part 
1437) for the same tree or vine loss, the eligible owner must choose 
whether to receive the other program benefits or payments under this 
part. The eligible owner cannot receive both. However, if the other 
program benefits are not available until after the eligible owner has 
received benefits under this part, the eligible owner may obtain the 
other program benefits if the eligible owner refunds the total amount of 
the payment received prior to receiving the other program benefits. If 
the eligible owner

[[Page 315]]

purchased additional coverage insurance, as defined in 7 CFR 400.651, or 
is eligible for emergency loans, the eligible owner will be eligible for 
assistance under such program, and this part as long as the amount 
received for the loss under the additional coverage or the emergency 
loan together with the amount received from the other programs does not 
exceed the amount of the actual loss of the eligible owner.

comply with the terms and conditions of this part, or other condition 
for payment imposed by the county or State committee or the Deputy 
Administrator, such person shall refund any payment paid under this part 
together with interest. Such interest shall be charged at the rate 
determined for late payment charges under part 1403 of this title and

eligible trees or eligible vines because of imposition of the payment 
limitation in Sec. 783.5(c) or any other reason. If owners partially 
complete their practices after they apply, but do not replant or 
rehabilitate all of their qualifying trees or vines, the county 
committee shall calculate payment based on the extent performed.
    (b) Eligible owners who have been paid but choose not to complete 
the practice by the final practice expiration date shall refund their 
payments with interest. Interest on these refunds shall be calculated 
beginning on the date the payment was disbursed. Such refund amounts may

out in Sec. 784.10, Year 2, Year 3, and Year 4 payments may be made to 
sheep and lamb operations at the following rates:
    (a) $3 for each qualifying feeder lamb; plus

<R05>
Sec. 784.10  Availability of funds for Year 1 through Year 4.

    (a) Total payments under this part, unless otherwise determined by 
the FSA, cannot exceed $67.7 million. At the close of Year 3, FSA will 
determine if the remaining available funds will be sufficient for 
program Year 4. In the event that funds should be insufficient to 
complete the expected payments to eligible producers during program Year 
4, then the payment rates for that program year shall be prorated by a 
national factor so as to reduce the expected payments to be made to the 
amount available and payment shall be made at those rates until monies 
are expended. Payments made during a prorated program year shall be made 
first-come, first-served so long as there are monies available in the 
manner set for in these regulations. Payments for preceding years will 
not be affected.
    (b) A national factor shall be determined, if necessary for 
slaughter lamb and feeder lamb payments based on the factoring of the 
remaining available funds at the conclusion of Year 3 divided by the 
average number of slaughter and feeder lambs that qualified for benefits 
during Year 2 and Year 3.

[[Page 322]]

    (c) Of the $67.7 million of total funds under this part, $26 million 
is specifically earmarked for the ewe lamb incentive payments, with a 
target of $13 million per year for Year 3 and Year 4. Those monies ($26 
million) should be used only for the ewe incentive payments and no other 
funds shall be used for those payments. A national factor shall be 
determined, if necessary for ewe lamb payments based on the factoring of 
the remaining available funds at the conclusion of Year 3 divided by the 
number of ewe lambs that qualified for ewe lamb payments during Year 3.
    (d) In the event that approval of all eligible applications would 
result in expenditures in excess of the amount available, FSA shall 
reduce the national factor in such manner as FSA, in its sole 
discretion, finds fair and reasonable.


<R05>
Sec. 784.11  Appeals.

    Any sheep and lamb operation which is dissatisfied with a

payment under this part shall be jointly and severally liable with other 
persons or operations involved in such claim for benefits for any refund 
due under this part and for related charges. The remedies provided in 
this part shall be in addition to other civil, criminal, or

States Treasury charges the Commodity Credit Corporation for funds, from 
the date FSA made such benefits available to the date of repayment or

certification request as set forth in this section.
    (b) Application for grant. A State requesting a grant will submit 
the following to the Administrator:
    (1) Application for Federal Assistance, Standard Form 424 (available 
in any FSA office and on the Internet, http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/
grants/);

pay the allowable costs of operation and administration of the 
components of a qualifying State's mediation program that have been 
certified as set forth in Sec. 785.3(b)(2). Costs of services other than 
mediation services to covered persons within the State are not 
considered part of the cost of operation and administration of the 
mediation program for the purpose of determining the amount of a grant 
award.
    (1) Allowable costs. Subject to applicable cost principles as set 
forth or referenced in Sec. 3016.22 of this title, allowable costs for 
operations and administration are limited to those that are reasonable 
and necessary to carry out the State's certified mediation program in 
providing mediation services for covered persons within the State. 
Specific categories of costs allowable under the certified State 
mediation program include, and are limited to:
    (i) Staff salaries and fringe benefits;
    (ii) Reasonable fees and costs of mediators;
    (iii) Office rent and expenses, such as utilities and equipment 
rental;

Principles found in part 3015, subpart T, of this title and OMB Circular 
No. A-87; and
    (iv) Services provided by a State mediation program that are not 
consistent with the features of the mediation program certified by the 
State, including advocacy services on behalf of a mediation participant, 
such as representation of a mediation client before an administrative

Federal or State Court proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 785.5  Fees for mediation services.

    A requirement that non-USDA parties who elect to participate in 
mediation pay a fee for mediation services will not preclude 
certification of a certified State mediation program or its

[[Page 327]]

eligibility for a grant; however, if participation in mediation is 
mandatory for a USDA agency, a certified State mediation program may not 
require the USDA agency to pay a fee to participate in a mediation.


<R05>
Sec. 785.6  Deadlines and address.

    (a) Deadlines. (1) To be a qualifying State as of the beginning of a 
fiscal year and to be eligible for grant funding as of the beginning of 
the fiscal year, the Governor of a State or head of a State agency 
designated by the Governor of a State must submit a request for 
certification and application for grant on or before August 1 of the 
calendar year in which the fiscal year begins.
    (2) Requests received after August 1. FSA will accept requests for 
re-certifications and for new certifications of State mediation programs 
after August 1 in each calendar year; however, such requests will not be 
considered for grant funding under Sec. 785.7(c) until after March 1.
    (3) Requests for additional grant funds during a fiscal year. Any 
request by a State mediation program that is eligible for grant funding 
as of the beginning of the fiscal year for additional grant funds during 
that fiscal year for additional, unbudgeted demands for mediation

    (b) Address. The request for certification or re-certification and 
any grant request must be mailed or delivered to: Administrator, Farm 
Service Agency, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Stop 0501, 1400

<R05>
Sec. 785.7  Distribution of Federal grant funds.

    (a) Maximum grant award. A grant award shall not exceed 70 percent 
of the budgeted allowable costs of operation and administration of the 
certified State mediation program. In no case will the sum granted to a 
State exceed $500,000 per fiscal year.
    (b) Funding criteria. FSA will consider the following in determining 
the grant award to a qualifying State:
    (1) Demand for and use of mediation services (historical and 
projected);
    (2) Scope of mediation services;
    (3) Service record of the State program, as evidenced by:
    (i) Number of inquiries;
    (ii) Number of requests for and use of mediation services, 
historical and projected, as applicable;
    (iii) Number of mediations resulting in signed mediation agreements;
    (iv) Timeliness of mediation services; and
    (v) Activities promoting awareness and use of mediation;
    (4) Historic use of program funds (budgeted versus actual); and
    (5) Material changes in the State program.
    (c) Disbursements of grant funds. (1) Grant funds will be paid in 
advance, in installments throughout the Federal fiscal year as requested 
by a certified State mediation program and approved by FSA. The initial 
payment to a program in a qualifying State eligible for grant funding as 
of the beginning of a fiscal year shall represent at least one-fourth of 
the State's annual grant award. The initial payment will be made as soon 
as practicable after certification, or re-certification, after grant 
funds are appropriated and available.
    (2) Payment of grant funds will be by electronic funds transfer to 
the designated account of each certified State mediation program, as 
approved by FSA.
    (d) Administrative reserve fund. After funds are appropriated, FSA 
will set aside 5 percent of the annual appropriation for use as an 
administrative reserve.
    (1) Subject to paragraph (a) of this section and the availability of 
funds, the Administrator will allocate and disburse sums from the 
administrative reserve in the following priority order:
    (i) Disbursements to cover additional, unbudgeted demands for 
mediation services in qualifying States eligible for grant funding as of 
the beginning of the fiscal year;
    (ii) Grants to qualifying States whose requests for new 
certification or re-certification were received between August 2 and 
March 1. A previously qualifying State that submits a request for re-
certification received after August 1 may receive a grant award 
effective as of the beginning of the fiscal year. A

[[Page 328]]

newly qualifying State that submits a request for certification received 
after August 1 may receive a grant award effective March 31 of the 
fiscal year.
    (iii) Any balance remaining in the administrative reserve will be 
allocated pro rata to certified State mediation programs based on their 
initial fiscal year grant awards.
    (2) All funds from the administrative reserve will be made available 
on or before March 31 of the fiscal year.
    (e) Period of availability of funds. (1) Certified State mediation 
programs receiving grant funds are encouraged to obligate award funds 
within the Federal fiscal year of the award. A State may, however, carry 
forward any funds disbursed to its certified State mediation program 
that remain unobligated at the end of the fiscal year of award for use 
in the next fiscal year for costs resulting from obligations in the 
subsequent funding period. Any carryover balances plus any additional 
obligated fiscal year grant will not exceed the lesser of 70 percent of 
the State's budgeted allowable costs of operation and administration of 
the certified State mediation program for the subsequent fiscal year, or 
$500,000.
    (2) Grant funds not spent in accordance with this part will be 
subject to de-obligation and must be returned to the USDA.


<R05>
Sec. 785.8  Reports by qualifying States receiving mediation grant funds.

    (a) Annual report by certified State mediation program. No later

    (a) The Administrator is authorized to withdraw certification of a 
State mediation program, terminate or suspend the grant to such program, 
require a return of unspent grant funds, a reimbursement of grant funds

    (9) The opportunity afforded the debtor to enter into a written 
agreement which is acceptable to FSA for the repayment of the debt;
    (10) That FSA maintains the right to initiate legal action to 
collect the amount of the debt;
    (11) That if any portion of the debt remains unpaid or if a 
repayment schedule satisfactory to FSA has not been arranged 90 days 
after the due date, a penalty charge shall be assessed on the unpaid 
balance of the debt as prescribed in Sec. 792.10(e);
    (b) When FSA deems it necessary to protect the Government's 
interest, written demand may be preceded by other appropriate actions.


<R05>
Sec. 792.5  Collection by payment in full.

    Except as FSA may provide, FSA shall collect debts owed to the 
Government, including applicable interest, penalties, and administrative 
costs, in full, whenever feasible whether the debt is being collected by 
administrative offset or by another method, including voluntary payment. 
If a debt is paid in one lump sum after the due date, FSA will impose 
late payment interest, as provided in Sec. 792.10, unless such interest 
is waived as provided in Sec. 792.11.


<R05>
Sec. 792.6  Collection by installment payments.

    (a) Payments in installments may be arranged, at FSA' discretion, if 
a debtor furnishes satisfactory evidence of inability to pay a claim in 
full by the specified date. The size and frequency of installment 
payments shall:
    (1) Bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the 
debtor's ability to pay; and
    (2) Normally be of sufficient size and frequency to liquidate the 
debt in not more than three years.
    (b) Except as otherwise determined by FSA, no installment 
arrangement will be considered unless the debtor submits a certified 
financial statement which reflects the debtor's assets, liabilities, 
income, and expenses. The financial statement shall not be required to 
be submitted sooner than 15 workdays following its request by FSA.
    (c) All installment payment agreements shall be in writing and 
require the payment of interest at the late payment interest rate in 
effect on the date such agreement is executed, unless such interest is 
waived or reduced by FSA. The installment agreement shall specify all 
the terms of the arrangement and include provision for accelerating the 
debt in the event the debtor defaults.
    (d) FSA may deem a repayment plan to be abrogated if the debtor 
fails to comply with its terms.
    (e) If the debtor's financial statement or other information 
discloses the ownership of assets which are not encumbered, the debtor 
may be required to secure the payment of an installment note by 
executing a security agreement and financing agreement which provides 
FSA a security interest in the assets until the debt is paid in full.
    (f) If the debtor owes more than one debt to FSA, FSA may allow the 
debtor to designate the manner in which a voluntary installment payment 
is to be

[[Page 334]]

applied. If the debtor does not designate the application of a voluntary 
installment or partial payment, the payment will be applied to such 
debts as determined by FSA.


<R05>
Sec. 792.7  Collection by administrative offset.

    (a) The provisions of this section shall apply to all debts due FSA 
except as otherwise provided in this part and part 1404 of this title. 
This section is not applicable to:
    (1) FSA requests for administrative offset against money payable to 
a debtor from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund and FSA 
requests for salary offset against a present, former or retired employee 
of the Federal Government which shall be made in accordance with 
regulations at part 3 of this title;
    (2) FSA requests for administrative offset against a Federal income 
tax refund payable to a debtor which shall be made in accordance with 
Sec. 792.19;
    (3) Cases in which FSA must adjust, by increasing or decreasing, a 
payment which is to be paid under a contract in order to properly make 
other payments due by FSA; and
    (4) Any case in which a statute explicitly provides for or prohibits 
using administrative offset to collect the debt for the type of debt 
involved.
    (b) Debts due FSA or CCC may be collected by administrative offset 
from amounts payable by FSA when:
    (1) The debtor has been provided written notification of the basis 
and amount of the debt and has been given an opportunity to make 
payment. Such written notification and opportunity includes notice of 
the right to pursue an administrative appeal in accordance with part 780 
of this chapter or any other applicable appeal procedures, if not 
previously provided;
    (2) The debtor has been provided an opportunity to request to 
inspect and copy the records of FSA related to the debt;
    (3) The debtor has been given the opportunity to enter into a 
written agreement which is acceptable to FSA for repayment of the debt;
    (4) The debtor has been notified in writing that the debt will be 
collected by administrative offset if not paid; and
    (5) The debt has not been delinquent for more than ten years or 
legal action to enforce the debt has not been barred by an applicable 
period of limitation, whichever is later.
    (c) Administrative offset shall also be effected against amounts 
payable by FSA:
    (1) When requested or approved by the Department of Justice; or
    (2) When a person is indebted under a judgment in favor of FSA or 
the United States.
    (d) A payment due any person may be offset when there is a breach of 
a contract or a violation of FSA program requirements, and offset is 
considered necessary by FSA to protect the financial interests of the 
Government.
    (e) FSA may effect administrative offset against a payment to be 
made to a debtor prior to completion of the procedures required by 
paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section if:
    (1) Failure to take the offset would substantially prejudice FSA' 
ability to collect the debt; and
    (2) The time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably 
permit the completion of those procedures.
    (f)(1) Judgments in favor of the United States may be offset against 
any amounts payable by FSA based on information provided by or obtained 
from the Department of Justice. Debts due any agency other than FSA 
which have not been reduced to judgment shall be offset against amounts 
payable by FSA to a debtor when an agency of the U.S. Government has 
submitted a written request for offset which is mailed or hand-delivered 
to the appropriate FSA State office, Kansas City Financial Management 
Office, Kansas City Management Office, or Kansas City Commodity Office. 
Such written request must:
    (i) Bear the signature of an authorized representative of the 
requesting agency;
    (ii) Include a certification that all requirements of the law and 
the regulations for collection of the debt and for requesting offset 
have been complied with;

[[Page 335]]

    (iii) State the name, address (including county), and, where legally 
available, the Social Security number or employer ID number of the 
debtor, and a brief description of the basis of the debt, including 
identification of the judgment, if any;
    (iv) State the amount of the debt separately as to principal, 
interest, penalties, and administrative costs. Interest, if any, shall 
be computed on a daily basis to a date shown in the request. The amount 
to be offset shall not exceed the principal sum owed by the debtor, plus 
interest computed in accordance with the request, and any late payment 
interest, penalties and administrative costs that have been assessed;
    (v) Certify that the debtor has not filed for bankruptcy. If the 
debtor has filed for bankruptcy, a copy of the order of the bankruptcy 
court relieving the agency from the automatic stay must be included; and
    (vi) State the name, address, and telephone number of a contact 
person within the agency and the address to which payment should be 
sent.
    (2) Unless prohibited by law, the head of an agency, or a designee, 
may defer or subordinate in whole or in part the right of the agency to 
recover through offset all or part of any indebtedness to such agency, 
or may withdraw a request for offset. Notice of such action must be sent 
to the appropriate FSA office.
    (g)(1) After FSA has complied with the provisions of this part, FSA 
may request other agencies of the Government to offset amounts payable 
by them to persons indebted to FSA.
    (2) In the case of a request to IRS for a tax refund offset, the 
provisions at Sec. 792.19 shall apply.
    (h)(1) Debts shall be collected by offset in the following order of 
priority without regard to the date of the request for such collection:
    (i) Debts to FSA.
    (ii) Debts to other agencies of USDA as determined by FSA.
    (iii) Debts to other government agencies as determined by FSA.
    (2) In the case of multiple debts involving the same debtor, FSA 
may, at its discretion, deviate from the usual order of priority in 
applying recovered amounts to debts owed other agencies when considered 
to be in the Government's best interest. Such decision shall be made by 
FSA based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case.
    (i) Amounts recovered by offset for FSA and CCC debts but later 
found not to be owed to the Government shall be promptly refunded.
    (j) The debtor shall be notified whenever any offset action has been 
taken.
    (k) Offsets made pursuant to this section shall not deprive a debtor 
of any right he or she might otherwise have to contest the debt involved 
in the offset action either by administrative appeal or by legal action.
    (l) Any action authorized by the provisions of this section may be 
taken:
    (1) Against a debtor's pro rata share of payments due any entity 
which the debtor participates in, either directly or indirectly, as 
determined by FSA.
    (2) When FSA determines that the debtor has established an entity, 
or reorganized, transferred ownership of, or changed in some other 
manner, their operation, for the purpose of avoiding the payment of the 
claim or debt.
    (m) The amount to be offset shall not exceed the actual or estimated 
amount of the debt, including interest, administrative charges, and 
penalties, unless the Department of Justice requests that a larger 
specified amount be offset.
    (n) Offset action will not be taken against payments when:
    (1) A debt has been discharged as provided in Sec. 792.16.
    (2) FSA determines such action will unduly interfere with the 
administration of an FSA or CCC program.
    (3) The debt has been delinquent for more than ten years or legal 
action to enforce the debt due FSA is barred by an applicable period of 
limitation, whichever is later.

<R05>
Sec. 792.8  Priorities of offsets versus assignments.

    (a) No amounts payable to a debtor by FSA shall be paid to an 
assignee until there have been collected any amounts owed by the debtor 
except as provided in this section.

[[Page 336]]

    (b) A payment which is assigned in accordance with part 1404 of this 
title by execution of Form CCC-36 shall be subject to offset for any 
debt owed to FSA or CCC or any judgment in favor of the United States 
without regard to the date notice of assignment was accepted by FSA or 
CCC.
    (c) A payment which is assigned in accordance with part 1404 of this 
title by execution of Form CCC-252 shall be offset:
    (1) Against any debt of the assignor entered on the debt record of 
the applicable FSA office prior to the filing of such form with FSA or 
CCC, or
    (2) At anytime, regardless of the date of filing of such form with 
FSA or CCC, if the debt which is the basis for the offset arises from a 
judgment in favor of the United States, or under the same contract under 
which the payment is earned by the assignor.
    (d) With respect to all other Federal agencies, offset shall be made 
of any amounts due any other Federal agency which have not been reduced 
to judgment, and which are entered on the debt record of the appropriate 
FSA office prior to the date the notice of assignment was accepted by 
FSA or CCC.
    (e) Any amount due and payable to the assignor which remains after 
deduction of amounts paid to the assignee shall be available for offset.


<R05>
Sec. 792.9  Withholding.

    (a) Withholding of a payment prior to the completion of an 
applicable offset procedure may be made from amounts payable to a debtor 
by FSA to ensure that the interests of FSA and the United States will be 
protected as provided in this section.
    (b) A payment may be withheld to protect the interests of FSA or the 
United States only if FSA determines that:
    (1) There has been a serious breach of contract or violation of 
program requirements and the withholding action is considered necessary 
to protect the financial interests of FSA;
    (2) There is substantial evidence of violations of criminal or civil 
frauds statutes and criminal prosecution or civil frauds action is of 
primary importance to program operations of FSA;
    (3) Prior experience with the debtor indicates that collection will 
be difficult if amounts payable to the debtor are not withheld;
    (4) There is doubt that the debtor will be financially able to pay a 
judgment on the claim of FSA;
    (5) The facts available to FSA are insufficient to determine the 
amount to be offset or the proper payee;
    (6) A judgment on a claim of FSA has been obtained; or
    (7) Such action has been requested by the Department of Justice.
    (c) Except for debts due FSA or CCC, withholding action by FSA on 
amounts payable to debtors of other Government agencies may not be made 
unless requested by the Department of Justice.


<R05>
Sec. 792.10  Late payment interest, penalty and administrative charges.

    (a) Late payment interest provisions of this section shall not 
apply:
    (1) To debts owed by Federal agencies and State and local 
governments. Interest on debts owed by such entities shall be charged to 
the extent authorized under the common law or applicable statutory 
authority.
    (2) If an applicable statute, regulation, agreement, or contract 
either prohibits the charging of such interest or specifies the interest 
or charges applicable to the debt involved;
    (3) If the late payment interest is waived by FSA in accordance with 
Sec. 792.11.
    (4) To administrative charges as set forth in paragraph (f) of this 
section.
    (b) FSA will assess late payment interest on the full amount of 
delinquent debts. For purposes of this section, the term ``full amount 
of the delinquent debt'' means the sum of the principal, accrued program 
interest, and any other charges which are otherwise due and owing to FSA 
on the delinquent debt at the time the late payment interest is 
assessed, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (d)(3) of this 
section.
    (c) The late payment interest shall be expressed as an annual rate 
of interest which FSA charges on delinquent debts. The late payment 
interest rate shall be equal to the higher of the Treasury Department's 
current value

[[Page 337]]

of funds rate or the rate of interest assessed under the Prompt Payment 
Act, determined as of the date specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) 
of this section. The rate of interest assessed under the Prompt Payment 
Act was chosen as an alternative rate to ensure that the Government 
would recoup interest at a rate which was at least as high as that which 
it pays for late payments.
    (d)(1) When a debt results from a statute, regulation, contract, or 
other agreement with specific provisions for late payment interest and 
payment due date, late payment interest shall accrue on the amount of 
the debt from the first day the debt became delinquent, unless otherwise 
provided by statute.
    (2) With respect to debts not resulting from a statute, regulation, 
contract, or agreement containing specific provisions for late payment 
interest and payment due date, late payment interest shall begin to 
accrue from the date on which notice of the debt, including notice of 
late payment interest, is first mailed or hand-delivered to the debtor.
    (3) The rate of late payment interest initially assessed will be 
fixed for the duration of the indebtedness, except when a debtor has 
defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new 
agreement. FSA may then set a new rate of interest which reflects the 
late payment interest rate in effect at the time the new agreement is 
executed. All charges which accrued, but which were not collected under 
the defaulted agreement, shall be added to the principal to be paid 
under a new repayment agreement.
    (4) The late payment interest on delinquent debts will accrue on a 
daily basis.
    (e) Except as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a 
penalty charge of three (3) percent per annum will be assessed on any 
portion of a debt which remains unpaid ninety (90) days after the date 
described in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, if no repayment 
schedule satisfactory to FSA has been agreed upon. Such penalty charge 
will be assessed retroactively from the date late payment interest began 
to accrue and applied on a daily basis. Such rate shall continue to 
accrue until the delinquent debt has been paid.
    (f) FSA shall assess as administrative charges the additional costs 
of processing delinquent debts against the debtor, to the extent such 
costs are attributable to the delinquency. Such costs include, but are 
not limited to, costs incurred in obtaining a credit report, costs of 
employing commercial firms to locate debtor, costs of employing 
contractors for collection services, costs of selling collateral or 
property to satisfy the debt.
    (g) When a debt is paid in partial or installment payments, payments 
will be applied first to administrative charges, second to the penalty 
charge assessed in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section and 
late payment interest, and third to outstanding principal.


<R05>
Sec. 792.11  Waiver of late payment interest, penalty charge and administrative charges.

    (a) FSA shall waive the collection of late payment interest and 
administrative charges on a debt or any portion of a debt which is paid 
within 30 days after the date on which late payment interest began to 
accrue.
    (b) FSA may waive the assessment and collection of all or a portion 
of the penalty charge on debts which are appealed in accordance with 7 
CFR part 780 or other applicable appeal procedures from either the date 
of the appeal or the date such interest began to accrue, whichever is 
later, until the date a final administrative determination is issued. 
Such waiver shall not apply for any delay due to:
    (1) The appellant's request for a postponement of the scheduled 
hearing;
    (2) The appellant's request for an additional time following the 
hearing to present additional information or a written closing 
statement; or
    (3) The appellant's failure to timely present information to the 
reviewing authority.
    (c) Assessment and collection of late payment interest, the penalty 
charge and administrative charges under this part may be waived by FSA 
in full, or in part, if it is determined by the Controller, FSA, or his 
or her designee,

[[Page 338]]

that such action is in the best interest of FSA.


<R05>
Sec. 792.12  Administrative appeal.

    If the opportunity to appeal the determination has not previously 
been provided under part 24 of this title or part 780 of this chapter or 
any other appeal procedure, a debtor may obtain an administrative review 
under part 780 of this chapter, or other applicable appeal procedures, 
of FSA' determination concerning the existence or amount of a debt, if a 
request is filed with the authority who made the determination within 15 
days of the date of FSA' initial demand letter, unless a longer period 
is specified in the initial demand letter.


<R05>
Sec. 792.13  Additional administrative collection action.

    Nothing contained in this part shall preclude the use of any other 
administrative or contractual remedy which may be available to FSA to 
collect debts owed to the Government.


<R05>
Sec. 792.14  Contact with debtor's employing agency.

    When a debtor is employed by the Federal Government or is a member 
of the military establishment or the Coast Guard, and collection by 
offset cannot be accomplished in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5514, FSA may 
contact the employing agency to arrange for payment of the debt by 
allotment or otherwise, in accordance with section 206 of Executive 
Order No. 11222, May 8, 1965, 30 FR 6469, 3 CFR, 1964-1965 Comp., p 306.


<R05>
Sec. 792.15  Prior provision of rights with respect to debt.

    FSA will not provide an administrative appeal with respect to issues 
which were raised or should have been raised at any administrative 
review requested by the debtor as provided under another statute or 
regulation before:
    (a) Effecting administrative offset;
    (b) Referring the debt to private collection or credit reporting 
agencies;
    (c) Referring the debt for salary offset against the current pay of 
a present or former Government employee; or
    (d) Referring the debt to IRS for tax refund offset.


<R05>
Sec. 792.16  Discharge of debts.

    (a) Except as required by other applicable regulation or statute, a 
debt or part thereof owed FSA shall be discharged with the concurrence 
of the Department of Justice, if applicable, and the records and 
accounts on that debt closed in the following situations:
    (1) When an obligation or part thereof is discharged in bankruptcy;
    (2) When an obligation or part thereof is the subject of a final 
judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction which is adverse 
to FSA and no appeal will be taken by FSA;
    (3) When a debt or part thereof is compromised and paid, the amount 
of such compromise;
    (4) When collection of a debt by administrative offset is barred in 
accordance with Sec. 792.7(b)(5).
    (b) Debts discharged in accordance with this section may be reported 
to the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to Sec. 792.20.

Sec. 792.17  Referral of delinquent debts to credit reporting agencies.

    (a) This section specifies the procedures that will be followed by 
FSA and the rights that will be afforded to debtors when FSA reports 
delinquent debts to credit reporting agencies.
    (b) Before disclosing information to a credit reporting agency in 
accordance with this part, FSA shall review the claim and determine that 
it is valid and delinquent.
    (c) Before a debt may be referred to a credit reporting agency, the 
debtor must be notified, pursuant to Sec. 792.4, of FSA' intent to make 
such a report. Such notification shall include:
    (1) FSA' intent to disclose to a credit reporting agency that the 
debtor is responsible for the debt, and that such disclosure will be 
made not less than 60 days after notification to such debtor.
    (2) The information intended to be disclosed to the credit reporting 
agency under paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
    (3) The debtor's right to enter a repayment agreement on the debt,

    (4) The debtor's right to review of this action in accordance with

original disclosure of delinquent debt information was made of any 
substantial change in the condition or amount of the claim.
    (2) FSA shall promptly verify or correct, as appropriate, 
information about the debt on request of a credit reporting agency. The

information necessary to establish the identity of the debtor;
    (2) The amount, status, and history of the claim; and
    (3) The program under which the claim arose.
    (h) Reasonable action shall be taken to locate a debtor for whom FSA 
does not have a current address before reporting delinquent debt 
information to a credit reporting agency.
    (i)(1) Before disclosing delinquent debt information to a credit 
reporting agency, FSA shall, upon request of the debtor, provide for a

    (2) Upon receipt of a request for review within 30 days from the

for disclosure to a credit reporting agency until a final decision 
regarding the appropriateness of disclosure to a credit reporting agency 
is made.
    (3) Upon completion of the review, the reviewing official shall 
transmit to the debtor a written notification of the decision. If

reporting agencies to which information will be provided are in 
compliance with the provisions of all the laws and regulations of the 
United States relating to providing credit information.

<R05>
Sec. 795.4  Family members.

    Effective for the 1987 through 1990 crops, an individual shall not

and leases, loans or gives equipment, land or labor to such an 
individual; and
    (b) Such family members were organized as separate units prior to

Sec. 795.5  Timing for determining status of persons.

    Except as otherwise set forth in this part, the status of

[[Page 342]]


<R05>
Sec. 795.6  Multiple individuals or other entities.

    The rules in Secs. 795.5 through 795.16 shall be used to determine 
whether certain multiple individuals or legal entities are to be treated 
as one person or as separate persons for the purpose of applying the 
limitation. In cases in which more than one rule would appear to be 
applicable, the rule which is most restrictive on the number of persons 
shall apply.


<R05>
Sec. 795.7  Entities or joint operations not considered as a person.

    A partnership, joint venture, tenants-in-common, or joint tenants 
shall not be considered as a person but, notwithstanding the provisions 
of Sec. 795.3, each individual or other legal entity who shares in the 
proceeds derived from farming by such joint operations shall be 
considered a separate person, except as otherwise provided in this part, 
and shall be listed as a producer for payment purposes on program 
documents. The payment shares listed on the program documents for each 
individual or other legal entity shall be the same as each individual or 
other legal entity shares in the proceeds derived from farming by such 
joint operation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each individual or other 
legal entity who shares in the proceeds derived from farming by such 
joint operation shall not be considered as a separate person unless the 
individual or other legal entity is actively engaged in the farming 
operations of the partnership or other joint operation. An individual or 
other legal entity shall be considered as actively engaged in the 
farming operation only if its contribution to the joint operation is 
commensurate with its share in the proceeds derived from farming by such 
joint operation. Members of the partnership or joint venture must 
furnish satisfactory evidence that their contributions of land, labor, 
management, equipment, or capital to the joint operation are 
commensurate with their claimed shares of the proceeds. A capital 
contribution may be a direct out-of-pocket input of a specified sum or 
an amount borrowed by the individual. If the contribution consists 
substantially of capital, such capital must have been contributed 
directly to the joint operation by the individual or other legal entity 
and not acquired as a result of (a) a loan made to the joint operation, 
(b) a loan which was made to such individual or other legal entity by 
the joint operation or any of its members or related entities, or (c) a 
loan made to such individual or other legal entity which was guaranteed 
by the joint operation or any of its members or related entities.


<R05>
Sec. 795.8  Corporations and stockholders.

    (a) A corporation (including a limited partnership) shall be 
considered as one person, and an individual stockholder of the 
corporation may be considered as a separate person to the extent that 
such stockholder is engaged in the production of the crop as a separate 
producer and otherwise meets the requirements of Sec. 795.3, except that 
a corporation in which more than 50 percent of the stock is owned by an 
individual (including the stock owned by the individual's spouse, minor 
children, and trusts for the benefit of such minor children), or by a 
legal entity, shall not be considered as a separate person from such 
individual or legal entity.
    (b) Where the same two or more individuals or other legal entities 
own more than 50 percent of the stock in each of two or more 
corporations, all such corporations shall be considered as one person.
    (c) The percentage share of the value of the stock owned by an 
individual or other legal entity shall be determined as of March 1 of 
the crop year, except that where a stockholder voluntarily acquires 
stock after March 1 and before the harvest of the crop, the amount of 
any stock so acquired shall be included in determining the percentage 
share of the value of the stock owned by the stockholder. Where there is 
only one class of stock, a stockholder's percentage share of the value 
of the outstanding stock shall be equal to the percentage of the 
outstanding stock owned by the stockholder. If the corporation has more 
than one class of stock the percentage share of the value of the stock 
owned by a stockholder shall be determined by the Deputy Administrator 
on the basis of market quotations, and if market quotations

[[Page 343]]

are lacking or too scarce to be recognized the percentage share of the 
value of the stock shall be determined by the Deputy Administrator on 
the basis of all relevant factors affecting the fair market value, 
including the rights and privileges of the various stock issues.

<R05>
Sec. 795.9  Estate or trust.

    (a) An estate or irrevocable trust shall be considered as one person 
except that, where two or more estates or irrevocable trusts have common 
beneficiaries or heirs (including spouses and minor children) with more 
than a 50-percent interest, all such estates or irrevocable trusts shall 
be considered as one person.
    (b) An individual heir of an estate or beneficiary of a trust may be 
considered as a separate person to the extent that such heir or 
beneficiary is engaged in the production of crops as a separate producer 
and otherwise meets the requirements of Sec. 795.3, except that an 
estate or irrevocable trust which has a sole heir or beneficiary shall 
not be considered as a separate person from such heir or beneficiary.
    (c) Where an irrevocable trust or an estate is a producer on a farm 
and one or more of the beneficiaries or heirs of such trust or estate 
are minor children, the minor children's pro rata share of the program 
payments to the trust or estate shall be attributed to the parent of the 
minor children except as otherwise provided in Sec. 795.12.
    (d) A revocable trust shall not be considered as a separate person 
from the grantor.


<R05>
 Sec. 795.10  Club, society, fraternal or religious organization.

    Each individual club, society, fraternal or religious organization 
may be considered as a separate person to the extent that each such 
club, society, fraternal or religious organization is engaged in the 
production of crops as a separate producer and otherwise meets the 
requirements of Sec. 795.3.


<R05>
Sec. 795.11  Husband and wife.

    With respect to the 1988 crop year, a husband and wife shall be 
considered to be one person except that such individuals who, prior to 
their marriage, were separately engaged in unrelated farming operations 
will be determined to be separate persons with respect to such farming 
operations so long as the operations remain separate and distinct from 
any farming operation conducted by the other spouse if such individuals 
have executed a Contract to Participate in the 1988 Price Support and 
Production Adjustment Programs by April 15, 1988. Such individuals must 
file a form FSA-561 with the county committee for each such farming 
operation by July 8, 1988, if they desire to be considered as separate 
persons under this section.

[53 FR 21410, June 8, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 795.12  Minor children.

    (a) A minor child and his parents or guardian (or other person 
responsible for him) shall be considered as one person, except that the 
minor child may be considered as a separate person if such minor child 
is a producer on a farm in which the parents or guardian or other person 
responsible for him (including any entity in which the parents or 
guardian or other person responsible for him has a substantial interest, 
i.e., more than a 20-percent interest) takes no part in the operation of 
the farm (including any activities as a custom farmer) and owns no 
interest in the farm or allotment or in any portion of the production on 
the farm, and if such minor child:
    (1) Is represented by a court-appointed guardian who is required by 
law to make a separate accounting for the minor and ownership of the 
farm is vested in the minor, or
    (2) Has established and maintains a different household from his 
parents or guardian and personally carries out the actual farming 
operations on the farm for which there is a separate accounting, or

[[Page 344]]

    (3) Has a farming operation resulting from his being the beneficiary 
of an irrevocable trust and ownership of the property is vested in the 
trust or the minor.
    (b) A person shall be considered a minor until he reaches 18 years 
of age. Court proceedings conferring majority on a person under 18 years 
of age will not change such person's status as a minor for purposes of 
applying the regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 795.13  Other cases.

    Where the county committee is unable to determine whether certain 
individuals or legal entities involved in the production of a commodity 
are to be treated as one person or separate persons, all the facts 
regarding the arrangement under which the commodity is produced shall be 
submitted to the State committee for decision. Where the State committee 
is unable to determine whether such individuals or legal entities are to 
be treated as one person or separate persons, all the facts regarding 
the arrangement under which the farming operation is conducted shall be 
submitted to the Deputy Administrator for decision.


<R05>
Sec. 795.14  Changes in farming operations.

    (a) Subject to the provisions of this part, a person may exercise 
his or her right heretofore existing under law, to divide, sell, 
transfer, rent, or lease his or her property if such division, sale, 
transfer, rental arrangement, or lease is legally binding as between the 
parties thereto. However, any document representing a division, sale, 
transfer, rental arrangement, or lease which is fictitious or not 
legally binding as between the parties thereto shall be considered to be 
for the purpose of evading the payment limitation and shall be 
disregarded for the purpose of applying the payment limitation. Any 
change in farming operations that would otherwise serve to increase the 
number of persons for application of the payment limitation must be bona 
fide and substantive.
    (b) A substantive change includes, for example, a substantial 
increase or decrease in the size of the farm by purchase, sale, or 
lease; a substantial increase or decrease in the size of allotment by 
purchase, sale, or lease; a change from a cash lease to a share lease or 
vice versa; and dissolution of an entity such as a corporation or 
partnership.
    (c) Examples of the types of changes that would not be considered as 
substantive are the following:
    Example 1. A corporation is owned equally by four shareholders. The 
corporation owns land, buildings, and equipment and in the prior year 
carried out substantial farming operations. Three of the shareholders 
propose forming a partnership which they would own equally. The 
partnership would cash lease land and equipment from the corporation 
with the objective of having the three partners considered as separate 
persons for purposes of applying the payment limitation under the 
provisions of Sec. 795.7 of the regulations.
    The formation of such a partnership and the leasing of land from a 
corporation in which they hold a major interest would not constitute a 
substantive and bona fide change in operations. Therefore, the 
corporation and the partners would be limited to a single payment 
limitation.
    Example 2. Three individuals each have individual farming operations 
which, if continued unchanged, would permit them to have a total of 
three payment limitations.
    The three individuals propose forming a corporation which they would 
own equally. The corporation would then cash lease a portion of the 
farmland owned and previously operated by the individuals with the 
objective of having the corporation considered as a separate person for 
purposes of applying the payment limitation under the provisions of 
Sec. 795.8 of the regulations. The formation of such a corporation and 
the leasing of land from the stockholders would not constitute a 
substantive and bona fide change in operations. Therefore, the 
corporation and the three individuals would be limited to three payment 
limitations.


<R05>
Sec. 795.15  Determining whether agreement is a share lease or a cash lease.

    (a) Cash lease. If a rental agreement contains provisions for a 
guaranteed minimum rental with respect to the amount of rent to be paid 
to the landlord by a tenant, such agreement shall be considered to be a 
cash rental agreement. In addition, the rental agreement must be 
customary and reasonable for the area.
    (b) Share lease. If a rental agreement contains provisions that 
require the payment of rent on the basis of the

[[Page 345]]

amount of the crop produced or the proceeds derived from the crop, such 
agreement shall be considered to be a share rental agreement. In 
addition, the rental agreement must be customary and reasonable for the 
area.

[51 FR 8454, Mar. 11, 1986 and 51 FR 36905, Oct. 16, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 795.16  Custom farming.

    (a) Custom farming is the performance of services on a farm such as 
land preparation, seeding, cultivating, applying pesticides, and 
harvesting for hire with remuneration on a unit of work basis, except 
that, for the purpose of applying the provisions of this section, the 
harvesting of crops and the application of agricultural chemicals by 
firms regularly engaged in such businesses shall not be regarded as 
custom farming. A person performing custom farming shall be considered 
as being separate from the person for whom the custom farming is 
performed only if:
    (1) The compensation for the custom farming is paid at a unit of 
work rate customary in the area and is in no way dependent upon the 
amount of the crop produced, and (2) the person performing the custom 
farming (and any other entity in which such person has more than a 20-
percent interest) has no interest, directly or indirectly, (i) in the 
crop on the farm by taking any risk in the production of the crop, 
sharing in the proceeds of the crop, granting or guaranteeing the 
financing of the crop, (ii) in the allotment on the farm, or (iii) in 
the farm as landowner, landlord, mortgage holder, trustee, lienholder, 
guarantor, agent, manager, tenant, sharecropper, or any other similar 
capacity.
    (b) A person having more than a 20-percent interest in any legal 
entity performing custom farming shall be considered as being separate 
from the person for whom the custom farming is performed only if:
    (1) The compensation for the custom farming service is paid at a 
unit of work rate customary in the area and is in no way dependent upon 
the amount of the crop produced, and (2) the person having such interest 
in the legal entity performing the custom farming has no interest, 
directly or indirectly, (i) in the crop on the farm by taking any risk 
in the production of the crop, sharing in the proceeds of the corp, 
granting or guaranteeing the financing of the crop, (ii) in the 
allotment on the farm, or (iii) in the farm as landowner, landlord, 
mortgage holder, trustee, lienholder, guarantor, agent, manager, tenant, 
sharecropper, or in any other similar capacity.


<R05>
Sec. 795.17  Scheme or device.

    All or any part of the payments otherwise due a person under the 
upland cotton, wheat, feed grain and rice programs on all farms in which 
the person has an interest may be withheld or required to be refunded if 
the person adopts or participates in adopting any scheme or device 
designed to evade or which has the effect of evading the rules of this 
part. Such acts shall include, but are not limited to, concealing from 
the county committee any information having a bearing on the application 
of the rules of this part or submitting false information to the county 
committee (for example, a set-aside agreement which is entered into that 
differs from information furnished to the county committee concerning 
the manner in which program payments are actually shared, concerning the 
actual facts of a sale, or concerning the transfer of property) or 
creating fictitious entities for the purpose of concealing the interest 
of a person in a farming operation.


<R05>
Sec. 795.20  Joint and several liability.

    Where two or more individuals or legal entities, who are treated as 
one person hereunder, receive payments which in the aggregate exceed the 
limitation, such individuals or legal entities shall be liable, jointly 
and severally, for any liability arising therefrom. The provisions of 
this part requiring the refund of payments shall be applicable in 
addition to any liability under criminal and civil fraud statutes.


<R05>
Sec. 795.21  Appeals.

    Any person may obtain reconsideration and review of determinations 
made under this part in accordance with the appeal regulations, part 780 
of this chapter, as amended.

limitation regulations and published at 36 FR 16569, 37 FR 3049, 39 FR

of this part.

    The information collection requirements contained in these

Sec. 795.24  Relief.

    If a producer relied on a county committee and/or State committee 
``person'' determination for a crop year and higher reviewing authority 
makes a more restrictive determination, the Deputy Administrator may 
grant relief only for such crop year if the producer was not afforded an 
opportunity to exercise other alternatives with respect to the 
producer's farming operation and the program provisions and the county 
committee has determined that the producers acted in good faith based 
upon the original ``person'' determination.

Sec. 798.3  Index.

    5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) requires that each agency publish or otherwise 
make available a current index of all materials required to be made 
available for public inspection and copying. FSA maintains an index of 
FSA National Handbooks, CCC Board Dockets, decisions of the Board of 
Contract Appeals of the Department of Agriculture affecting FSA or CCC, 
and Marketing Quota Review Committee determinations. In view of the 
small number of public requests for such index, publication of the index 
is unnecessary and impractical. The index is maintained and available to 
the public at the office shown in Sec. 798.2 and copies of the index are 
available upon request in person or by mail to that office.


<R05>
Sec. 798.4  Request for records.

    Request for records under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3) shall be made in 
accordance with 7 CFR 1.3. Reasonable requests for material not in 
existence may also be honored where their compilation will not unduly 
interfere with FSA operations and programs. Each FSA office in the field 
and each FSA office and division in Washington (see statement of 
Organization and Functions of FSA, 40 FR 18815, and of CCC, 35 FR 14951, 
and any amendments thereto) is designated as an ``information center'' 
and shall make space available to inspect and copy records in their 
custody not exempted from disclosure. Copies of records shall also be 
made available upon request. The head of each office or division is 
authorized to receive requests for records and to make determinations 
regarding requests for records in the office's custody in accordance 
with 7 CFR 1.4(c). Requests to Washington divisions and offices shall be 
addressed to USDA, FSA, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, D.C. 20013. The heads 
of FSA field offices shall be addressed as listed in the local telephone 
directory under ``U.S. Government, Department of Agriculture, FSA''.

<R05>
Sec. 799.1  Background.

    The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 
et seq.) establishes national policies and goals for the protection of 
the environment. Section 102(2) of NEPA contains certain procedural 
requirements directed toward the attainment of such goals. Section 
(102)(2) also requires all Federal agencies to give appropriate 
consideration to the environmental effects of their proposed actions in 
their decisionmaking and to prepare detailed environmental statements on 
recommendations or reports on proposals for legislation and other major 
Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human 
environment. Executive Order 11991 of May 24, 1977 (42 FR 26967), 
directed the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to issue regulations 
to implement the procedural provisions of NEPA. Accordingly, CEQ issued 
final NEPA regulations (40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508) on November 29, 
1978, which are binding on all Federal agencies as of July 30, 1979. 
These regulations provide that each Federal agency shall as necessary 
adopt implementing procedures to supplement the regulations. The U.S. 
Department of Agriculture adopted such procedures in a final rule (7 CFR 
part 3100) published on July 30, 1979. The CEQ regulations at 40 CFR 
1507.3 (b) identify those items which must be addressed in agency 
procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 799.2  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to establish agency procedures which 
supplement NEPA regulations issued by CEQ and USDA. This regulation, 
together with such NEPA regulations issued by CEQ and USDA, will 
supersede regulations issued by the Farm Service Agency (FSA) on 
December 20, 1974 (39 FR 43996).


<R05>
Sec. 799.3  Applicability.

    This part, together with NEPA regulations issued by CEQ and USDA, 
applies to all programs administered by FSA which might have significant 
impacts on the environment.


<R05>
Sec. 799.4  Definitions.

    (a) The term environmental evaluation means agency appraisal of the 
potential or likely environmental impacts of proposed legislation, a new 
program, a major change in a program, an action related to a program or 
an action related to part of a program which will be used by the 
responsible agency official to determine whether or not an environmental 
assessment and/or an environmental impact statement is needed. Such 
appraisal shall relate to the same environmental concerns as an 
environmental impact statement. The environmental evaluation shall 
particularly

[[Page 350]]

focus on the adverse affects of FSA actions on the environmental factors 
listed on Form FSA-929 (see Appendix 2) and on the significance of the 
action as discussed in the CEQ regulations concerning NEPA at 40 CFR 
1508.27. As required, the environmental evaluation shall be made by an 
interdisciplinary team.
    (b) In the regulations in this part and in all instructions, forms, 
and documents in connection therewith, all other words and phrases 
shall, unless the context or subject matter otherwise requires, have the 
meanings assigned to them in the regulations governing reconstitution of 
farms, allotments and bases, part 719 of this chapter, as amended.


<R05>
Sec. 799.5  FSA officials and offices responsible for carrying out NEPA.

    (a) Responsible officials. The Administrator of FSA, or his or her 
designee, is the responsible Federal official for carrying out the 
purpose of NEPA for all FSA programs. County committees, State 
committees, and Directors of Washington Divisions, within their 
respective areas of responsibility with the assistance of the FSA 
representative on the USDA Environmental Quality Committee, shall assist 
the Administrator in complying with the policies and purposes of NEPA 
generally, and, in particular, in determining whether the quality of the 
human environment will be significantly affected in implementing agency 
programs and preparing the necessary environmental documents.
    (b) Offices responsible for carrying out NEPA--(1) Washington 
divisions. Washington divisions are responsible for carrying out NEPA 
with regard to legislative proposals and multi-State and national 
programs or major revisions of national programs.
    (2) State committees. State committees are responsible for carrying 
out NEPA with regard to major actions in a State or area within a State.
    (3) County committees. County committees are responsible for 
carrying out NEPA with regard to major actions within a county.
    (c) All environmental assessments, environmental impact statements 
(EISs) and similar documents will be forwarded through the appropriate 
agency channels to the FSA representative on the USDA Environmental 
Quality Committee for review and submission to the Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 799.6  Adoption of regulations issued by others in implementing the procedural provisions of NEPA.

    In addition to provisions provided for in this part 799, FSA adopts 
the NEPA regulations issued by CEQ (40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508) and 
NEPA regulations issued by USDA (7 CFR part 3100).


<R05>
Sec. 799.7  Early involvement in private and state and local activities requiring Federal approval.

    (a) The NEPA regulations at 40 CFR 1501.2(d) require agencies to 
provide for early involvement in actions which, while planned by private 
applicants or other non-Federal entities, require some form of Federal 
involvement.
    (b) To implement the requirements of 40 CFR 1501.2(d) with respect 
to these actions FSA shall:
    (1) Prepare, where practicable, generic guidelines describing the 
scope and level of environmental information required from applicants 
seeking assistance from FSA as a basis for evaluating their proposed 
actions, and make these guidelines available upon request.
    (2) Provide such guidance on a project-by-project basis to 
applicants seeking assistance from FSA.
    (3) Upon receipt of an application for agency approval, or 
notification that an application will be filed, consult as required with 
other appropriate parties to initiate and coordinate the necessary 
environmental analyses.
    (c) The responsibilities under this section shall be coordinated by 
the Conservation and Environmental Protection Division of the Farm 
Service Agency, Washington, D.C.
    (d) To facilitate compliance with paragraph (a) of this section, 
private applicants seeking assistance from FSA and other non-Federal 
entities are expected to:
    (1) Contact FSA as early as possible in the planning process for 
guidance on the scope and level of environmental

[[Page 351]]

information required to be submitted in support of their application;
    (2) Conduct any studies which are deemed necessary and appropriate 
by FSA to determine the impact of the proposed action on the human 
environment;
    (3) Consult with appropriate Federal, regional, State and local 
agencies and other potentially interested parties during preliminary 
planning stages to ensure that all environmental factors are identified;
    (4) Submit applications for all Federal, regional, State and local 
approvals as early as possible in the planning process;
    (5) Notify FSA as early as possible of all other Federal, regional, 
State, local and Indian tribe actions required for project completion so 
that FSA may coordinate all Federal environmental reviews; and
    (6) Notify FSA of all known parties potentially affected by or 
interested in the proposed action.


<R05>
Sec. 799.8  Making supplements to EISs part of the final administrative record.

    Where FSA evaluates a proposal on the basis of a formal 
administrative record and an EIS on the proposal has been prepared, any 
supplement to the EIS shall be made a part of the formal record before a 
final decision on the proposal is made.


<R05>
Sec. 799.9  Ensuring that environmental factors are considered in agency decisionmaking.

    (a) The NEPA regulations at 40 CFR 1501.1 contain requirements to 
ensure adequate consideration of environmental factors in 
decisionmaking. To fulfill these requirements, FSA officials shall:
    (1) Consider all relevant environmental factors in evaluating 
proposals for agency action;
    (2) Make all relevant environmental documents, comments and 
responses part of the record in formal rulemaking or adjudicatory 
proceedings.
    (3) Ensure that all relevant environmental documents, comments and 
responses accompany the proposal through existing review processes;
    (4) Consider only those alternatives encompassed by the range of 
alternatives discussed in the relevant environmental documents when 
evaluating proposals for agency action.
    (5) Where an EIS has been prepared, consider the specific 
alternatives analyzed in the EIS when evaluating the proposal which is 
the subject of the EIS.
    (b) The four categories of FSA activities that have or are likely to 
have significant environment impacts on the human environment are:
    (1) Legislative proposals.
    (2) Initial program implementation.
    (3) Major changes in ongoing programs.
    (4) Major environmental concerns with ongoing programs.
    (c) Initial NEPA involvement in program categories in paragraph (b) 
of this section shall begin at the time FSA begins developing proposed 
legislation, begins the planning stage for implementing a new or changed 
program or receives notice that an ongoing program may have a 
significant adverse impact on the quality of the human environment. 
Where a legislative EIS or environmental assessment is part of the 
formal transmittal of a legislative program proposal to Congress, such 
legislative EIS or assessment may negate the need for the subsequent 
preparation of a program impact statement when FSA implements the 
resulting program. The decision whether such additional statement is 
needed will be made by an interdisciplinary team. The NEPA process on 
legislative proposals and FSA programs is carried out at the national 
level.
    (d) Individual farm participation in FSA programs will normally not 
require any major involvement with the NEPA process. The practices 
carried out under FSA programs that might have impacts on the quality of 
the human environment will normally have been discussed in environmental 
assessments or impact statements on the applicable programs. However, 
for those practices that might significantly affect the quality of the 
human environment, the county committee

[[Page 352]]

shall make an environmental evaluation before approval. If the 
environmental evaluation shows that the implementation of a proposed FSA 
practice on an individual farm will have significant adverse affects on 
the quality of the human environment, the county committee will not 
approve the practice implementation until after the completion of the 
NEPA-EIS process in accordance with this part. For those actions for 
which technical assistance is provided by an agency other than FSA, and 
such technical agency is required by its regulations to implement NEPA 
requirements when providing such assistance, the county committee shall 
use the environmental determination and considerations of such agency 
instead of duplicating the NEPA-EIS process. Individual farm 
participation in acreage set-aside, acreage allotments, price support 
and loans and other similar or related programs will not significantly 
affect the quality of the human environment.
    (e) Pooling agreements and special projects carried out under 
several FSA programs involving two or more farmers in a local geographic 
area will not normally require any major involvement with the NEPA 
process. However, the county committee shall, with the assistance of a 
local interdisciplinary team, as necessary, make an environmental 
evaluation of proposed pooling agreements or special projects that have 
a potential for significantly affecting the quality of the human 
environment. The NEPA process shall begin with the initial involvement 
of FSA personnel in the planning or development of pooling agreements or 
special projects. If it is determined from an environmental evaluation 
that the implementation of a proposed pooling agreement or a proposed 
special project will have a significant adverse impact on the quality of 
the human environment, the completion of the NEPA-EIS process in 
accordance with these regulations will be necessary before approval. For 
those actions for which technical assistance is provided by an agency 
other than FSA and such technical agency is required by its regulations 
to implement NEPA when providing such assistance the county committee 
shall use the environmental determinations and considerations of such 
agency instead of duplicating the NEPA-EIS process.


<R05>
Sec. 799.10  Criteria and identification of FSA actions as to degree of involvement under the NEPA process.

    (a) FSA will for each of its legislative proposals, initial program 
implementations, program changes or any actions under its ongoing 
programs make a determination by the use of an environmental evaluation 
as to whether or not an environmental assessment or EIS is required.
    (b) The NEPA regulations issued by CEQ at 40 CFR 1507.3(b)(2) in 
conjunction with the regulations at 40 CFR 1508.4 require agencies to 
determine those typical classes of actions for treatment under NEPA. The 
typical classes of FSA actions for treatment under NEPA are set forth as 
follows:
    (1) Actions normally requiring an EIS are:
    (i) Production adjustment programs to balance supply and demand of 
specified commodities, through cropland set-aside or other acreage 
diversion.
    (ii) Agricultural Conservation Program.
    (iii) Rural Clean Water Program.
    (iv) Other major actions that are determined after an environmental 
evaluation and/or an environmental assessment to significantly affect 
the quality of the human environment.
    (2) Actions normally not requiring an assessment or an EIS are:
    (i) Individual farm participation in FSA programs.
    (ii) Pooling agreements and special projects under FSA programs.
    (iii) Production adjustment programs for tobacco, peanuts and extra 
long staple cotton.
    (iv) Emergency Conservation Program.
    (v) Water Bank Program.
    (vi) Forestry Incentives Program.
    (vii) Sugar Program.
    (viii) Wool and Mohair Incentives Program.
    (ix) Bee and Dairy Indemnity Programs.
    (x) Commodity Income and Support and Disaster Protection Programs.
    (xi) Facility Loan Program.
    (xii) Grain Reserve Program.
    (xiii) Livestock Feed Program.

[[Page 353]]

    (xiv) Naval Stores Program.
    (xv) Indian Acute Distress Donation Program.
    (xvi) Other major actions that are determined after an environmental 
evaluation not to significantly affect the quality of the human 
environment.
    (c) FSA will independently determine by an environmental evaluation 
whether an environmental assessment or an EIS is required on actions 
included in paragraph (b) of this section where the presence of 
extraordinary circumstances or other unforseeable factors indicate that 
some other level of environmental review may be appropriate.
    (d) If an environmental evaluation indicates that an action will 
significantly affect the quality of the human environment, the 
preparation of an environmental assessment and/or an EIS will be 
necessary before the action is carried out.


<R05>
Sec. 799.11  Expedited procedures.

    Where emergency circumstances make it necessary to take action with 
significant environmental impact without following the provisions of the 
NEPA regulations issued by CEQ, USDA, and FSA, FSA will, by working 
through the USDA Office of Environmental Quality, consult with CEQ and/
or EPA about alternative arrangements (7 CFR 3100.35).


<R05>
Sec. 799.12  Program termination.

    An environmental assessment or an EIS will not be needed when a 
program or part of a program is discontinued because of a mandatory 
legislative requirement where the enabling legislation for such program 
does not provide authority to ameliorate or mitigate any resulting 
environmental effects on the quality of the human environment.


<R05>
Sec. 799.13  Environmental information.

    Interested persons may contact the Conservation and Environmental 
Protection Division, FSA, for information regarding FSA compliance with 
NEPA.

1, subpart A, of subtitle A of title 7 (7 CFR 1.1 through 1.23), and 
appendix A thereto, implementing the Freedom of Information Act (5 
U.S.C. 552). The Secretary's regulations, as implemented by this 
section, govern the availability of records of the Service to the 
public.
    (b) Public inspection and copying. Materials maintained by the 
Service, including those described in 7 CFR 1.5, will be made available, 
upon a request which has not been denied, for public inspection and 
copying at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Grain Inspection, Packers 
and Stockyards Administration, at 14th Street and Independence Avenue, 
SW., Washington, D.C. 20250. The public may request access to these 
materials during regular working hours, 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., est, 
Monday through Friday except for holidays.
    (c) Indexes. FGIS shall maintain an index of all material required 
to be made available in 7 CFR 1.5. Copies of these indexes will be 
maintained at the location given in paragraph (b) of this section. 
Notice is hereby given that quarterly publication of these indexes is 
unnecessary and impracticable, because the material is voluminous and 
does not change often enough to justify the expense of quarterly 
publication. However, upon specific request, copies of any index will be 
provided at a cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication.
    (d) Requests for records. Requests for records under 5 U.S.C. 
552(a)(3) shall be made in accordance with 7 CFR 1.6 and shall be 
addressed as follows: Office of the Administrator, Grain Inspection, 
Packers and Stockyards Administration; FOIA Request, U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, P.O. Box 96454, Washington, D.C. 20090-6454.
    (e) Appeals. Any person whose request under paragraph (d) of this 
section, is denied shall have the right to appeal such denial in 
accordance with 7 CFR 1.13. Appeals shall be addressed to the 
Administrator, Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration, 
FOIA Appeal, P.O. Box 96454, Washington, D.C. 20090-6454.

    Official Inspection and Class X or Class Y Weighing Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 800.15  Services.

    (a) General. These regulations implement requirements for a national 
inspection and weighing system. This system promotes the uniform and 
accurate application of the official grain standards and provides 
inspection and weighing services required by the Act and as requested by 
applicants for official services. The types and kinds of services 
available under the Act and regulations can be obtained at all specified 
service points in the United States and on U.S. grain in Canadian ports.
    (b) Responsibilities for complying with the official inspection, 
aflatoxin testing, and weighing requirements.
    (1) Export grain. Exporters are responsible for (i) complying with 
all inspection, Class X weighing, and other certification provisions and 
requirements of section 5(a)(1) of the Act and the regulations 
applicable to export grain and (ii) having all corn, as defined in 
Sec. 810.401, exported from the United States tested for aflatoxin 
contamination unless the buyer and seller agree not to have the corn 
tested. The Service shall perform the aflatoxin testing service unless 
the buyer and seller

[[Page 369]]

agree to have the corn tested by an entity other than the Service.
    (2) Intercompany barges. Operators of export elevators at export 
port locations are responsible for complying with Class X weighing 
requirements and regulations covering intercompany grain shipments 
received by barge.
    (3) Grain in marked containers. When grain is in a container that 
bears an official grade designation or mark, the person who places the 
designation or mark on the container or the person who places the grain 
in a container that bears the designation or mark shall be responsible 
for determining that the grain has been inspected or weighed by official 
personnel and qualifies for the official grade designation or mark.
    (4) Grain for which representations have been made. Any person who 
makes a representation that (i) grain has been officially inspected or 
weighed; or (ii) grain has been officially inspected or weighed and 
found to be of a particular kind, class, quality, condition, or weight; 
or (iii) particular facts have been established with respect to the 
grain by official inspection or weighing, shall be responsible for 
determining that the representation is true and is not in violation of 
the Act and regulations.

    (a) General. Official Export Grain Inspection and Weight 
Certificates, Official Export Grain Inspection Certificates, and 
Official Export Grain Weight Certificates for bulk or sacked grain shall 
be issued according to Sec. 800.162 for export grain loaded by an export 
elevator. Only these types of export certificates showing the official 
grade, official aflatoxin test results if required under the Act and the 
regulations, and/or the Class X weight of the grain shall be considered 
to be in compliance with inspection and weighing requirements under the 
Act for export grain.
    (b) Promptly furnished. Export certificates shall be considered 
promptly furnished if they are forwarded by the shipper or the shipper's 
agent to the consignee not later than 10 business days after issuance.

<R05>
Sec. 800.17  Special inspection and weighing requirements for sacked export grain.

    (a) General. Subject to the provisions of Sec. 800.18, sacked export 
grain shall be (1) officially inspected on the basis of official samples 
obtained with an approved sampling device and operated in accordance 
with instructions, (2) Class X weighed or checkweighed, and (3) 
officially checkloaded by official personnel at the time the grain is 
loaded aboard the export carrier, in accordance with the provisions of 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) Services at time of loading. When official sampling, official 
inspection, Class X weighing or checkweighing, and checkloading of 
sacked export grain loaded aboard an export carrier is performed at one 
location and time, official export inspection and weight certificate(s) 
which identify the export carrier shall be issued.
    (c) Services prior to loading. When official sampling, official 
inspection, and Class X weighing or checkweighing of sacked export grain 
is performed prior to the date of loading aboard an export carrier, 
official ``OUT'' certificates shall be issued. An examination by 
official personnel for condition and checkloading of the grain shall be 
made as the grain is loaded aboard the export carrier. If the 
examination for condition and the checkloading shows that the identity 
or quantity of the grain has not changed or the condition of the grain 
has not changed beyond expected variations prescribed in the 
instruction, official export inspection and weight certificates shall be 
issued on the basis of the official ``OUT'' certificates and the 
checkloading. If the identity, quantity, or the condition has changed, 
official export inspection and weight certificates shall be issued on 
the basis of the most representative samples, including weight samples, 
obtained at the time the grain is loaded aboard the export carrier.

    (a) General. Waivers from the official inspection and Class X 
weighing requirements for export grain under section 5 of the Act shall 
be provided in accordance with this section and the Act.
    (b) Waivers. (1) 15,000 metric-ton waiver. Official inspection and 
Class X weighing requirements apply only to exporters and individual 
elevator operators who (i) exported 15,000 metric tons or more of grain 
during the preceding calendar year, or (ii) have exported 15,000 metric 
tons or more of grain during the current calendar year. Exporters and 
elevator operators who are granted a waiver by reason of this paragraph 
shall, as a condition of the waiver, keep such accounts, records, and 
memorandum to fully and correctly disclose all transactions concerning 
lots of all export grain shipments. In addition, the exporters or 
elevator operators shall notify the Service in writing of the intention 
to export grain under this waiver. In the case of lots waived under this 
provision, if such lots are required by contract to be inspected or 
weighed, or if the lots are represented by official inspection or weight 
certificates, then such certificates shall meet the requirements of 
section 5 of the Act.
    (2) Grain exported for seeding purposes. Official inspection and 
Class X weighing requirements do not apply to grain exported for seeding 
purposes, provided that (i) the grain is (A) sold or consigned for sale 
and invoiced as seed; and (B) identified as seed for seeding purposes on 
the Shipper's Export Declaration; and (ii) records pertaining to these 
shipments are made available, upon request by the Service, for review or 
copying purposes.
    (3) Grain shipped in bond. Official inspection and weighing 
requirements do not apply to grain that is shipped from a foreign 
country to a foreign country through the United States in bond in 
accordance with applicable regulations of the United States Customs 
Service (19 CFR part 18).
    (4) Grain exported by rail or truck to Canada or Mexico. Inspection 
and weighing requirements do not apply to grain exported by rail or 
truck from the United States to Canada or Mexico.
    (5) Grain not sold by grade. Official inspection requirements may be 
waived by the Service on a shipment-by-shipment basis for export grain 
not sold, offered for sale, or consigned for sale by official grade if 
(i) the contract and any amendments clearly show that the buyer and 
seller mutually agree to ship the grain without official inspection and 
(ii) a copy of the contract and any amendments is furnished in advance 
of loading, along with a completed application on a form prescribed by 
the Service.
    (6) Service not available. Upon request, any required official 
inspection or Class X weighing of grain may be waived on a shipment-by-
shipment basis if (i) official personnel are not and will not be 
available within a 24-hour period to perform needed inspection or 
weighing services and (ii) both the buyer and seller of the grain are 
made aware that the grain has not been officially inspected or Class X 
weighed.
    (7) Emergency waiver. Upon request, the requirements for official 
inspection or Class X weighing may be waived whenever the Service 
determines (i) that an emergency exists that precludes official 
inspection or Class X weighing and (ii) that granting an emergency 
waiver will not impair the objectives of the Act. To qualify for an 
emergency waiver, the exporter or elevator operator shall make timely 
application and comply with all conditions which may be required by the 
Service.

<R05>
Sec. 800.46  Requirements for obtaining official services.

    (a) Consent and agreement by applicant. In submitting a request for 
official services, the applicant and the owner of the grain consent to 
the special and general requirements specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) 
of this section. These requirements are essential to carry out the 
purposes or provisions of the Act.
    (b) General requirements. (1) Access to grain. Grain on which 
official services are to be performed shall, except as provided in 
Secs. 800.85, 800.86, 800.98, and 800.99, be made accessible by the 
applicant for the performance of the requested official service and 
related monitoring and supervision activities. For the purposes of this 
section, grain is not ``accessible'' if it is offered for official 
services (i) in containers or carriers that are closed and cannot, with 
reasonable effort, be opened by or for official personnel; (ii) when any 
portion is located so as to prohibit the securing or a representative 
sample; or (iii) under conditions prescribed in the instructions as 
being hazardous to the health or safety of official personnel.
    (2) Working space. When official services are performed at an 
elevator, adequate and separate space must be provided by the applicant 
for the performance of the requested service and related monitoring and 
supervision activities. Space will be ``adequate'' if it meets the 
space, location, and safety requirements specified in the instructions.
    (3) Notice of changes. The operator of each facility at which 
official services

[[Page 374]]

are performed must notify the appropriate agency or field office 
promptly, in full detail, of changes in the grain handling and weighing 
facilities, equipment, or procedures at the elevator that could or would 
affect the proper performance of official services.
    (4) Loading and unloading conditions. As applicable, each applicant 
for official services must provide or arrange for suitable conditions in 
the (i) loading and unloading areas and the truck and railroad holding 
areas; (ii) gallery and other grain-conveying areas; (iii) elevator 
legs, distributor, and spout areas; (iv) pier or dock areas; (v) deck 
and stowage areas in the carrier; and (vi) equipment used in loading or 
unloading and handling the grain. Suitable conditions are those which 
will facilitate accurate inspection and weighing, maintain the quantity 
and the quality of the grain that is to be officially inspected or 
weighed, and not be hazardous to the health and safety of official 
personnel, as prescribed in the instructions.
    (5) Timely arrangements. Requests for official service shall be made 
in a timely manner; otherwise, official personnel may not be available 
to provide the requested service. For the purpose of this paragraph, 
``timely manner'' shall mean not later than 2 p.m., local time, of the 
preceding business day.
    (6) Observation of activities. Each applicant for official services 
must provide any interested person, or their agent, an opportunity to 
observe sampling, inspection, weighing, and loading or unloading of 
grain. Appropriate observation areas shall be mutually defined by the 
Service and facility operator. The areas shall be safe and shall afford 
a clear and unobstructed view of the performance of the activity, but 
shall not permit a close over-the-shoulder type of observation by the 
interested person.
    (7) Payment of bills. Each applicant, for services under the Act, 
must pay bills for the services according to Secs. 800.70 through 
800.73.
    (8) Written confirmations. When requested by the agency or field 
office, verbal requests for official services shall be confirmed in 
writing. Each written request shall be signed by the applicant, or the 
applicant's agent, and shall show or be accompanied by the following 
information: (i) The identification, quantity, and specific location of 
the grain; (ii) the name and mailing address of the applicant; (iii) the 
kind and scope of services desired; and (iv) any other information 
requested by the agency or field office.
    (9) Names and addresses of interested persons. When requested, each 
applicant for official services shall show on the application form the 
name and address of each known interested person.
    (10) Surrender of superseded certificates. When a request for 
official service results in a certificate being superseded, the 
superseded certificate must be promptly surrendered.
    (11) Recordkeeping and access. Each applicant for official services 
must comply with applicable recordkeeping and access-to-facility 
provisions in Secs. 800.25 and 800.26.
    (12) Monitoring equipment. Owners and operators of elevators shall, 
upon a finding of need by the Administrator, provide equipment necesary 
for the monitoring by official personnel of grain loading, unloading, 
handling, sampling, weighing, inspection, and related activities. The 
finding of need will be based primarily on a consideration of manpower 
and efficiency.
    (c) Special requirements for official Class X and Class Y weighing 
services. (1) General. Weighing services shall be provided only at 
weighing facilities which have met the conditions, duties, and 
responsibilities specified in section 7A(f) of the Act and this section 
of the regulations. Weighing services will be available only in 
accordance with the requirements of Sec. 800.115. Facilities desiring 
weighing services should contact the Service in advance to allow the 
Service time to determine if the facility complies with the provisions 
of the Act and regulations.
    (2) Conditions. The facility shall provide the following information 
annually to the Service: (i) The facility owner's name and address; (ii) 
the facility operator's name and address; (iii) the name of each 
individual employed by the facility as a weigher and a statement that

If a facility has, or plans to have, an automated data processing system 
which is used in conjunction with any portion of the scale system, grain 
handling system, or the preparing or printing of official weight 
certificates, the facility shall make available to the Service 
sufficient documentation to ensure that the system cannot be used 
deceptively or otherwise provide inaccurate information. The Service or 
approved scale testing and certification organization shall conduct an 
onsite review to evaluate the performance and accuracy of each scale 
that will be used for weighing grain under the Act, and the performance 
of the grain loading, unloading, and related grain handling equipment 
and systems.
    (3) Duties and responsibilities of weighing facilities requesting 
official services. (i) Providing official services. Upon request, each 
weighing facility shall permit official weighing services to be 
performed promptly.

issued by the manufacturer and by the Service. A scale log book for each 
approved scale used for official weighing services shall be maintained 
according to instructions at each weighing facility.
    (B) Malfunction of scales. Scales or scale systems that are 
operating in other than a correct and approved manner shall not be used 
for weighing grain under the Act. Before the malfunctioning scale or 
scale system can be used again for weighing grain under the Act, it 
shall be repaired and determined to be operating properly by the Service 
or approved scale testing and certification organization.
    (iv) Oral directives. FGIS oral directives issued to elevator 
personnel shall be confirmed in writing upon request by elevator 
management. Whenever practicable, the Service shall issue oral

Sec. 800.48  Dismissal of request for official services.

    (a) Conditions for dismissal. (1) General. An agency or the Service 
shall dismiss requests for official services when (i) Sec. 800.76 
prohibits the requested service; (ii) performing the requested service 
is not practicable; (iii) the agency or the

[[Page 376]]

Service lacks authority under the Act or regulations; or (iv) sufficient 
information is not available to make an accurate determination.
    (2) Original services. A request for original services shall be 
dismissed if a reinspection, review of weighing, appeal inspection, or 
Board appeal inspection has been performed on the same lot at the same 
specified service point within 5 business days.
    (3) Reinspection, appeal inspection, or Board appeal inspection 
services. A request for a reinspection, appeal inspection, or Board 
appeal inspection service shall be dismissed when: (i) The kind and 
scope are different from the kind and scope of the last inspection 
service; (ii) the condition of the grain has undergone a material 
change; (iii) the request specifies a representative file sample and a 
representative file sample is not available, (iv) the applicant requests 
that a new sample be obtained and a new sample cannot be obtained; or 
(v) the service cannot be performed within 5 business days of the date 
of the last inspection date.
    (4) Review of weighing services. A request for review of weighing 
services shall be dismissed when the request (i) is filed before the 
weighing results have been released, or (ii) is filed more than 90 
calendar days after the date of the original service.
    (b) Procedure for dismissal. When an agency or the Service proposes 
to dismiss a request for official services, the applicant shall be 
notified of the proposed action. The applicant will then be afforded 
reasonable time to take corrective action or to demonstrate there is no 
basis for the dismissal. If the agency or the Service determines that 
corrective action has not been adequate, the applicant will be notified 
again of the decision to dismiss the request for service, and any 
results of official services shall not be released.

(Secs. 8, 9, 10, 13 and 18, Pub. L. 94-582, 90 Stat. 2870, 2875, 2877,

<R05>
Sec. 800.50  Refusal of official services and civil penalties.

    (a) Grounds for refusal. Any or all services available to an 
applicant under the Act may be refused, either temporarily or 
indefinitely, by the Service for causes prescribed in section 10(a) of 
the Act. Such refusal by the Service may be restricted to the particular 
facility or applicant (if not a facility) found in violation or to a 
particular type of service, as the facts may warrant. Such action may be 
in addition to, or in lieu of, criminal penalties or other remedial 
action authorized by the Act.
    (b) Provision and procedure for summary refusal. The Service may, 
without first affording the applicant (hereafter in this section 
``respondent'') a hearing, refuse to provide official inspection and 
Class X or Y weighing services pending final determination of the 
proceeding whenever the Service has reason to believe there is cause, as 
prescribed in section 10 of the Act, for refusing such official services 
and considers such action to be in the best interest of the official 
services system under the Act: Provided that within 7 days after refusal 
of such service, the Service shall afford the respondent an opportunity 
for a hearing as provided under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

[[Page 377]]

Pending final determination, the Service may terminate the temporary 
refusal if alternative managerial, staffing, financial, or operational 
arrangements satisfactory to the Service can be and are made by the 
respondent.
    (c) Procedure for other than summary refusal. Except as provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section, before the Service refuses to provide 
official services the respondent shall be (1) notified of the services 
that are to be refused, the locations at which and the time period for 
which service will be refused, and the reasons for the refusal; and (2) 
afforded an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the provisions 
of the Rules of Practice Governing Formal Adjudicatory Proceedings 
Instituted by the Secretary Under Various Statutes (7 CFR 1.130 et 
seq.). At the discretion of the Service, prior to initiation of formal 
adjudicatory proceedings, the respondent may be given an opportunity to 
express his or her views on the action proposed by the Service in an 
informal conference before the Administrator of the Service. If, as a 
result of such an informal conference, the Service and the respondent 
enter into a consent agreement, no formal adjudicatory proceedings shall 
be initiated.
    (d) Assessment of civil penalties. Any person who has knowingly 
committed any violation of section 13 of the Act or has been convicted 
of any violation of other Federal law with respect to the handling, 
weighing, or official inspection of grain may be assessed a civil 
penalty not to exceed $75,000 for each such violation as the 
Administrator determines is appropriate to effect compliance with the 
Act. Such action may be in addition to, or in lieu of, criminal 
penalties under section 14 of the Act, or in addition to, or in lieu of, 
the refusal of official services authorized by the Act.
    (e) Provisions for civil penalty hearings. Before a civil penalty is 
assessed against any person, such person shall be afforded an 
opportunity for a hearing as provided under paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section.
    (f) Collection of civil penalties. Upon failure to pay the civil 
penalty, the Service may request the Attorney General to file civil 
action to collect the penalty in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.

                              Descriptions


<R05>
Sec. 800.55  Descriptions by grade.

    (a) General. In any sale, offer for sale, or consignment for sale, 
which involves the shipment of grain in interstate or foreign commerce, 
the description of grain, as being of a grade in any advertising, price 
quotation, other negotiation of sale, contract of sale, invoice, bill of 
lading, other document, or description on bags or other containers of 
the grain, is prohibited if such description is other than by an 
official grade designation, with or without additional information as to 
specified factors. An official grade designation contains any of the 
following: The term ``U.S.,'' the numerals 1 through 5, the term 
``Sample grade,'' or the name of a subclass or a special grade of grain 
specified in the Official United States Standards for Grain.
    (b) Proprietary brand names or trademarks. A description of grain by 
a proprietary brand name or a trademark that does not resemble an 
official

[[Page 378]]

grade designation will not be considered to be a description by grade; 
but a description by a proprietary brand name or trademark that contains 
singly or in combination any of the terms referenced in paragraph (a) of 
this section shall be considered to resemble an official grade 
designation.
    (c) Use of one or more factor designations. In interstate commerce, 
a description of grain by the use of one or more grade factor 
designations which appear in the Official United States Standards for 
Grain or by other criteria will not be considered to be a description by 
grade.
    (d) False or misleading descriptions. In any sale, offer for sale, 
or consignment for sale of any grain which involves the shipment of 
grain from the United States to any place outside thereof, knowingly 
using a false or misleading description of grain by official grade 
designation, or other description is prohibited.

<R05>
Sec. 800.56  Requirements on descriptions.

    Section 13 of the Act contains certain prohibitions with respect to 
the use of official grade designations, official marks, and other 
representations with respect to grain.
    (a) The use of an official grade designation, with or without factor 
information, or of official criteria information, or of the term 
``official grain standards,'' shall not, without additional information, 
be considered to be a representation that the grain was officially 
inspected.
    (b) The use of any symbol or term listed as an official mark, at 
Sec. 800.0(b)(68), with respect to grain shall be considered to be a 
representation of official service under the Act: Provided however, that 
the use of the official marks ``official certificate;'' ``officially 
inspected;'' ``official inspection;'' ``officially weighed;'' ``official 
weight;'' and ``official weighing'' shall not be considered to be a 
representation of official service under the Act if it is clearly shown 
that the activity occurred under the U.S. Warehouse Act (7 U.S.C. 241 et 
seq.): Provided further, that the use of the official mark ``officially 
tested'' with respect to grain inspection and weighing equipment shall 
not be considered to be a representation of testing under the Act if it 
is clearly shown that the equipment was tested under a State statute.

                        Grain Handling Practices


<R05>
Sec. 800.60  Deceptive actions and practices.

    In the absence of prior adequate notice to appropriate official 
personnel, any action or practice, including the loading, weighing, 
handling, or sampling of grain that knowingly causes or is an attempt to 
cause the issuance by official personnel of a false or incorrect 
official certificate or other official form, is deemed to be deceptive 
and, as such, is a violation of section 13(a)(3) of the Act. For the 
purposes of this paragraph, adequate notice is written or oral notice 
given to an agency or the Service, as applicable, before official 
personnel begin to perform official inspection or weighing services. If 
oral notice is given, it must be confirmed in writing within 2 business 
days. To be adequate, the notice must explain the nature and extent of 
the action or practice in question and must identify the grain, stowage 
container, equipment, facility, and the official personnel actually or 
potentially involved.

<R05>
Sec. 800.61  Prohibited grain handling practices.

    (a) Definitions. For the purpose of this section, dockage and 
foreign material in grain shall be:
    (1) Defined for export elevators at export port locations as set 
forth in 7 CFR part 810 and as dust removed from grain and collected in 
a bin/container and as dust settling on floors, equipment, and other 
areas, commonly referred to as dust sweepings; and
    (2) Defined for other than export elevators as set forth in 7 CFR 
part 810.
    (b) Prohibited practices. Except as permitted in paragraphs (c) and 
(d) of this section, no person shall:

[[Page 379]]

    (1) Recombine or add dockage or foreign material to any grain, or
    (2) Blend different kinds of grain except when such blending will 
result in grain being designated as Mixed grain in accordance with 
subpart E of the Official United States Standards for Grain.
    (3) Add water to grain for purposes other than milling, malting, or 
similar processing operations.
    (c) Exemption. (1) The Administrator may grant exemptions from 
paragraph (b) of this section for grain shipments sent directly to a 
domestic end-user or processor. Requests for exemptions shall be 
submitted by grain handlers to the Service through the domestic end-
users or processors or their representatives.
    (2) Grain sold under an exemption shall be consumed or processed 
into a product(s) by the purchaser and not resold into the grain market.
    (3) Products or byproducts from grain sold under an exemption shall 
not be blended with or added to grain in commercial channels, except for 
vegetable oil which may be used as a dust suppressant in accordance with 
(d)(4) of this section.
    (d) Exceptions. Paragraph (b) shall not be construed as prohibiting 
the following grain handling practices. Compliance with paragraphs 
(d)(1) through (d)(6) of this section does not excuse compliance with 
applicable Federal, State, and local laws.
    (1) Blending. Grain of the same kind, as defined by the Official 
United States Standards for Grain, may be blended to adjust quality. 
Broken corn or broken kernels may be recombined or added to whole grain 
of the same kind provided that no foreign material or dockage has been 
added to the broken corn or broken kernels.
    (2) Insect and fungi control. Grain may be treated to control 
insects and fungi. Elevators, other grain handlers, and their agents are 
responsible for the proper use and applications of insecticides and 
fungicides. Sections 800.88 and 800.96 include additional requirements 
for grain that is officially inspected and weighed.
    (3) Marketing dockage and foreign material. Dockage and foreign 
material may be marketed separately.
    (4) Dust suppressants. Grain may be treated with an additive, other 
than water, to suppress dust during handling. Elevators, other grain 
handlers, and their agents are responsible for the proper use and 
application of dust suppressants. Sections 800.88 and 800.96 include 
additional requirements for grain that is officially inspected and 
weighed.
    (5) Identification. Confetti or similar material may be added to 
grain for identification purposes. Elevators, other grain handlers, and 
their agents are responsible for the proper use and application of such 
materials. Sections 800.88 and 800.96 include additional requirements 
for grain that is officially inspected or weighed.
    (6) Export loading facilities. Between May 1, 1987, and December 31, 
1987, export elevators at export port locations may recombine dockage 
and foreign material, but not dust, with grain provided such 
recombination occurs during the loading of a vessel with the intended 
purpose of ensuring uniformity of dockage and foreign material in the 
cargo.

<R05>
Sec. 800.70  Fees for official services performed by agencies.

    (a) Assessment and use of fees. (1) Fees assessed by an agency for 
official inspection and Class X or Class Y weighing services or testing 
of inspection equipment shall be reasonable and nondiscriminatory.
    (2) In the case of a State or local governmental agency, fees shall 
not be used for any purpose other than to finance the cost of the 
official inspection and Class X or Class Y weighing service and 
inspection equipment testing service performed by the agency or the cost 
of other closely related programs administered by the agency.
    (b) Approval required. (1) Restriction. Only fees that meet the 
requirements stated in this section and are approved by the Service as 
reasonable and nondiscriminatory may be charged by an agency.

[[Page 380]]

    (2) Exceptions. For good cause shown by an agency, the Administrator 
may grant case-by-case exceptions to the requirements in this section, 
provided that a determination is made that the agency fees would be 
reasonable and nondiscriminatory.
    (c) Reasonable fees. In determining if an agency's fees are 
reasonable, the Service will consider whether the fees: (1) Cover the 
estimated total cost to the agency of (i) official inspection services, 
(ii) Class X or Class Y weighing services, (iii) inspection equipment 
testing services, and (iv) related supervision and monitoring activities 
performed by the agency; (2) Are reasonably consistent with fees 
assessed by adjacent agencies for similar services; (3) Are assessed on 
the basis of the average cost of performing the same or similar services 
at all locations served by the agency; and (4) Are supported by 
sufficient information which shows how the fees were developed.
    (d) Nondiscriminatory fees. In determining if fees are 
nondiscriminatory, the Service will consider whether the fees are 
collected from all applicants for official service in accordance with 
the approved fee schedule. Charges for time and travel incurred in 
providing service at a location away from a specified service point 
shall be assessed in accordance with the approved fee schedule.
    (e) Schedule of fees to be established. (1) Each agency shall 
establish a schedule of fees for official services which the agency is 
delegated or designated the authority to perform. The schedule shall be 
in a standard format in accordance with the instructions. Such schedules 
may include fees for nonofficial services provided by the agency, but 
they shall be clearly identified and will not be subject to approval by 
the Service.
    (2) The schedule shall be published and made available by the agency 
to all users of its services.
    (f) Request for approval of fees. (1) Time requirement. A request 
for approval of a new or revised fee shall be submitted to the Service 
not less than 60 days in advance of the proposed effective date for the 
fee. Failure to submit a request within the prescribed time period may 
be considered grounds for postponment or denial of the request.
    (2) Contents of request. Each request shall show (i) the present 
fee, if any, and the proposed fee, together with data showing in detail 
how the fee was developed, and (ii) the proposed effective date.
    (g) Review of request. (1) Approval action. If upon review the 
Service finds that the request and supporting data justify the new or 
revised fee, the request will be marked ``approved'' and returned to the 
agency.
    (2) Denial action. If the Service finds that the request and 
supporting data do not justify the new or revised fee, approval of the 
request will be withheld pending receipt of any additional supporting 
data which the agency has to offer. If the data are not submitted within 
a reasonable period, the request shall be denied. In the case of a 
denial of a request, the agency shall be notified of the reason for 
denial.

Sec. 800.72  Explanation of additional service fees for services performed in the United States only.

    (a) When transportation of the service representative to the service 
location (at other than a specified duty point) is more than 25 miles 
from an FGIS office, the actual transportation cost in addition to the 
applicable hourly rate for each service representative will be assessed 
from the FGIS office to the service point and return. When commercial 
modes of transportation (e.g., airplanes) are required, the actual 
expense incurred for the round-trip travel will be assessed. When 
services are provided to more than one applicant, the travel and other 
related charges will be prorated between applicants.
    (b) In addition to a 2-hour minimum charge for service on Saturdays, 
Sundays, and holidays, an additional charge will be assessed when the 
revenue from the services in Sec. 800.71, schedule A, table 2, does not 
equal or exceed what would have been collected at the applicable hourly 
rate. The additional charge will be the difference between the actual 
unit fee revenue and the hourly fee revenue. Hours accrued for travel 
and standby time shall apply in determining the hours for the minimum 
fee.

    (3 FGIS officials determine that the service representative cannot 
be utilized to provide service elsewhere without cost to the Service.
    (c) Application of fees when an application for service is withdrawn 
or dismissed. The applicable hourly rate will be assessed to the 
applicant for the entire period of scheduled service if the request is 
withdrawn or dismissed after the service representative departs for the 
service point, or if the service request is not canceled by 2 p.m., 
local time, the business day preceding the date of scheduled service. 
However, the applicable hourly rate will not be assessed to the 
applicant if FGIS officials determine that the service representative 
can be utilized elsewhere or released without cost to the Service.
    (d) To whom fees are assessed. Fees for inspection, weighing, and 
related services performed by service representatives, including 
additional fees as provided in Sec. 800.72, shall be assessed to and 
paid by the applicant for the service.
    (e) Monthly payment of administrative fee. At the option of the 
applicant, an agreement for 12 equal monthly payments may be entered 
into for payment of the administrative fee. These monthly payments will 
be based on the previous fiscal year's volume applied to

[[Page 386]]

the current year's administrative fee schedule. If the volume of grain 
inspected is more than the amount of grain agreed upon at the beginning 
of the fiscal year, at the point the agreed upon volume is exceeded, the 
current year's administrative fee schedule shall apply to the remaining 
amount of grain for the rest of the fiscal year. If the volume of grain 
inspected is less than the agreed upon amount, any excess monies paid to 
the Service shall be applied to the next fiscal year's administrative 
fee unless a request for a refund is made by the applicant.
    (f) Advance payment. As necessary, the Administrator may require 
that fees shall be paid in advance of the performance of the requested 
service. Any fees paid in excess of the amount due shall be used to 
offset future billings, unless a request for a refund is made by the 
applicant.
    (g) Form of payment. Bills for fees assessed under the regulations 
in this part for official services performed by FGIS shall be paid by 
check, draft, or money order, payable to the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration.

inspection purposes, an official sample shall be (i) obtained by 
official personnel; (ii) representative of the grain in the lot; (iii) 
protected from manipulation, substitution, and improper or careless 
handling; and (iv) obtained within the prescribed geographical 
boundaries of the agency or field office performing the service.
    (2) Official sample-lot reinspection and appeal inspection service. 
For an official sample-lot reinspection service or an official appeal 
sample-lot inspection service, the sample(s) on which the reinspection 
or appeal is determined shall (i) be obtained by official personnel and 
(ii) otherwise meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section. If the reinspection or appeal inspection is determined on the 
basis of official file sample(s), the samples shall meet the 
requirements of Sec. 800.82(d).
    (3) New sample. Upon request and if practicable, a new sample shall 
be obtained and examined as a part of a reinspection or appeal 
inspection. The provision for a new sample shall not apply if obtaining 
the new sample involves a change in method of sampling.
    (b) Representative sample. A sample shall not be considered 
representative unless it (1) has been obtained by official personnel, 
(2) is of the size prescribed in the instructions, and (3) has been 
obtained, handled, and submitted in accordance with the instructions. A 
sample which fails to meet the requirements of this paragraph may, upon 
request of the applicant, be inspected as a submitted sample.
    (c) Protecting samples. Official personnel shall protect official 
samples, warehouseman's samples, and submitted samples from 
manipulation, substitution, or improper and careless handling which may 
deprive the samples of their representativeness or which may change the 
physical or chemical properties of the grain, as appropriate, from the 
time of sampling or receipt until the inspection services are completed 
and the file samples have been discarded.
    (d) Restriction on sampling. Official personnel shall not perform an 
original inspection or a reinspection service on an official sample or a 
warehouseman's sample unless the grain from which the sample was 
obtained was located within the area of responsibility assigned to the 
agency or field office at the time of sampling. Upon request, the 
Administrator may grant an exception to this rule on a case-by-case 
basis.
    (e) Disposition of samples. (1) Excess grain. Any grain in excess of 
the quantity specified in the instructions for the requested service, 
the file samples, and samples requested by interested persons shall be 
returned to the lot from which the grain was obtained or to the owner of 
the lot or the owner's order.
    (2) Inspection samples. Inspection samples, after they have served 
their intended purpose, shall be disposed of as follows:
    (i) Samples which contain toxic substances or materials shall be 
kept out of food and feed channels, and

    (3) Submitted sample service. Each original submitted sample 
inspection service shall be performed on the basis of the sample as 
submitted.
    (b) Reinspection, and appeal inspection services. (1) Official 
sample-lot inspection service. Each of these inspection services shall 
be performed on the basis of official samples as available, including 
file samples, at the time the service is requested. In performing these 
services, a sample obtained with an approved diverter-type mechanical 
sampler or with a pelican sampler generally shall be used with respect 
to quality factors and official criteria, and a sample obtained with a 
probe at the time of the reinspection or appeal, generally, shall be 
used with respect to heating, musty, sour, insect infestation, and other 
condition and odor factors. In instances where original inspection 
results are based on samples obtained by probe, the decision as to 
whether file samples or new samples obtained by probe are to be used 
shall be made by the official personnel performing the service.
    (2) Warehouseman's sample-lot inspection service. Each reinspection 
service and appeal inspection service on a warehouseman's sample shall

Sec. 800.83  Sampling provisions by kind of movement.

    (a) Export cargo movements. (1) Bulk grain. Except as may be 
approved by the Administrator on a shipment-by-shipment basis in an 
emergency, each inspection for official grade, official factor, or 
official criteria on an export cargo shipment of bulk grain shall be 
performed on official samples obtained from the grain (i) as the grain 
is being loaded aboard the final carrier; (ii) after the final elevation 
of the grain prior to loading and as near to the final loading spout as 
is physically practicable (except as approved by the Administrator when 
representative samples can be obtained before the grain reaches the 
final loading spout); and

[[Page 390]]

(iii) by means of a diverter-type mechanical sampler approved by the 
Service and operated in accordance with instructions. If an approved 
diverter-type mechanical sampler is not properly installed at an 
elevator or facility as required, each certificate issued at that 
elevator or facility for an export cargo shipment of bulk grain shall 
show a statement indicating the type of approved sampling method used, 
as prescribed in the instructions.
    (2) Sacked grain. Each inspection for official grade, official 
factor, or official criteria on an export cargo shipment of sacked grain 
shall be performed on official samples obtained from the grain by any 
sampling method approved by the Service and operated in accordance with 
instructions.
    (b) Other movements. Each inspection for official grade, official 
factor, or official criteria on a domestic cargo movement (``In,'' 
``Out,'' or en route barge movement), a movement in a land carrier (any 
movement in a railcar, truck trailer, truck/trailer combination, or 
container), or a ``LOCAL'' movement of bulk or sacked grain shall be 
performed on official samples obtained from the grain by any sampling 
method approved by the Service and operated in accordance with the 
instructions.

<R05>
Sec. 800.84  Inspection of grain in land carriers, containers, and barges in single lots.

    (a) General. The reinspection of bulk or sacked grain loaded or 
unloaded from any carrier or container, except shiplot grain, shall be 
conducted in accordance with the provisions in this section and 
procedures prescribed in the instructions.
    (b) Single and multiple grade procedure. (1) Single grade. When 
grain in a carrier or container is offered for inspection as one lot and 
the grain is found to be uniform in condition, the grain shall be 
sampled, inspected, graded, and certificated as one lot. For the purpose 
of this paragraph, condition only includes the factors heating, musty, 
or sour.
    (2) Multiple grade. When grain in a carrier or container is offered 
for inspection as one lot and the grain is found to be not uniform in 
condition because portions of the grain are heating, musty, or sour, the 
grain in each portion will be sampled, inspected, and graded separately; 
but the results shall be shown on one certificate. The certificate shall 
show the approximate quantity or weight of each portion, the location of 
each portion in the carrier or container, and the grade of the grain in 
each portion.
    (3) Infested. If any portion of grain in a lot is found to be 
infested, according to applicable provisions of the Official U.S. 
Standards for Grain, the entire lot shall be considered infested. When 
grain in railcars or trucks with permanently enclosed tops is considered 
infested, the applicant for inspection shall be promptly notified and 
given the option of (i) receiving a grade certificate with a special 
grade designation indicating that the entire lot is infested or (ii) 
fumigating the grain in the lot in accordance with instructions and 
receiving a grade certificate without the special grade designation.
    (c) One certificate per carrier: exceptions. Except as provided in 
this paragraph, one official certificate shall be issued for the 
inspection of the grain in each truck, trailer, truck/trailer(s) 
combination, railcar, barge, or similarly sized carrier. The 
requirements of this paragraph are not applicable:
    (1) When grain is inspected in a combined lot under Sec. 800.85;
    (2) When grain is inspected under paragraph (d) of this section; or
    (3) When certification is at the option of the applicant in 
accordance with instructions.
    (d) Bulkhead lots. If grain in a carrier is offered for official 
inspection as two or more lots and the lots are separated by bulkheads 
or other partitions, the grain in each lot shall be sampled, inspected, 
and graded separately in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section. An official certificate shall be issued for each lot inspected. 
Each certificate shall show the term ``Bulkhead Lot,'' the approximate 
quantity or weight of the grain in the lot, the location of the lot in 
the carrier, and the grade of the grain in the lot.
    (e) Bottom not sampled. If bulk grain offered for official 
inspection is at rest in a carrier or container and is fully

[[Page 391]]

accessible for sampling in an approved manner, except that the bottom of 
the carrier or container cannot be reached with each probe, the grain 
shall be sampled as thoroughly as possible with an approved probe. The 
grain in the resulting samples shall be inspected, graded, and 
certificated, except that each certificate shall show a statement, as 
specified in the instructions, indicating the depth probed. Any 
inspection which is based on a sample that does not represent the entire 
carrier or container does not meet the mandatory inspection requirements 
of section 5(a)(1) of the Act.
    (f) Partial inspection--heavily loaded. (1) General. When an ``In'' 
movement of bulk grain is offered for inspection at rest in a carrier or 
container and is loaded in such a manner that it is possible to secure 
only door-probe or shallow-probe samples, the container shall be 
considered to be ``heavily loaded,'' and the request for inspection 
either shall be dismissed or a partial inspection shall be made. If the 
request is for the inspection of an ``Out'' movement of grain, the 
request shall be dismissed on the grounds that the grain is not 
accessible for a correct ``Out'' inspection.
    (2) Certification procedure. If a partial inspection is made, the 
grain will be sampled as thoroughly as possible with an approved probe 
and inspected, graded, and a ``partial inspection--heavily loaded'' 
certificate issued. The certificate shall show the words ``Partial 
inspection--heavily loaded'' in the space provided for remarks. The type 
of samples that were obtained shall be described in terms of ``door 
probe'' or ``shallow probe.''
    (3) Reinspection and appeal inspection procedure. A request for a 
reinspection or an appeal inspection service on grain in a carrier or 
container that is certificated as ``partial inspection--heavily loaded'' 
shall be dismissed in accordance with Sec. 800.48(a)(4).
    (4) Restriction. No ``partial inspection--heavily loaded'' 
certificate shall be issued for sacked grain or any inspection other 
than the inspections described in paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this 
section and Sec. 800.85(h)(2).
    (g) Part lots. (1) General. If a portion of the grain in a carrier 
or container is removed, the grain that is removed and the grain 
remaining shall be considered separate lots. When an official inspection 
service is requested on either portion, the grain shall be sampled, 
inspected, graded, and a ``part-lot'' inspection certificate issued.
    (2) Grain remaining in carrier or container. The certificate for 
grain remaining in a carrier or container shall show (i) the following 
completed statement: ``Partly unloaded; results based on portion 
remaining in (show carrier or container identification),'' (ii) the term 
``Part lot'' following the quantity information, (iii) the 
identification of the carrier or container, and (iv) the estimated 
amount and location of the part lot.
    (3) Grain unloaded from carrier or container. If grain is sampled by 
official personnel during unloading, the certificate for the grain that 
is unloaded shall show (i) the completed statement: ``Part lot; results 
based on portion removed from (show carrier identification)'' and (ii) 
the term ``Part lot'' following the quantity information. If the grain 
is not sampled by official personnel during unloading, the certificate 
may, upon request of the applicant, show a completed statement such as 
``Applicant states grain is ex-car '' or ``Applicant states grain is ex-
barge ,'' but the certificate shall not otherwise show a carrier or 
container identification or the term ``Part lot.''
    (h) Identification for compartmented cars. The identification for 
compartments in a compartmented railcar shall, in the absence of readily 
visible markings, be stated in terms of the location of the grain in a 
compartment, with the first compartment at the brake end of the car 
being identified as B-1, and the remaining compartments being numbered 
consecutively towards the other end of the car.

Sec. 800.85  Inspection of grain in combined lots.

    (a) General. The official inspection for grade of bulk or sacked 
grain loaded aboard, or being loaded aboard, or discharged from two or 
more carriers or containers (including barges designed for loading 
aboard a ship) as a

[[Page 392]]

combined lot shall be performed according to the provisions of this 
section and procedures prescribed in the instructions.
    (b) Application procedure. (1) For inspection during loading, 
unloading, or at rest. Applications for official inspection of grain as 
a combined lot shall (i) be filed in accordance with Sec. 800.116; (ii) 
show the estimated quantity of grain that is to be certificated as one 
lot; (iii) show the contract grade if applicable; and (iv) identify each 
carrier into which grain is being loaded or from which grain is being 
unloaded.
    (2) Recertification. An application for recertification as a 
combined lot of grain that has been officially inspected and 
certificated as two or more single lots shall (i) be filed not later 
than 2 business days after the latest inspection date of the single lots 
and (ii) show information specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (c) Inspection procedure; general--land carriers and barges. (1) 
Inspection during loading, or unloading, or at rest. Grain in two or 
more land carriers and barges that are to be officially inspected as a 
combined lot shall be sampled in a reasonably continuous operation. 
Representative samples shall be obtained from the grain in each 
individual carrier and inspected in accordance with procedures as 
prescribed in the instructions.
    (2) Recertification. Grain that has been officially inspected and 
certificated as two or more single lots may be recertificated as a 
combined lot if (i) the grain in each lot was sampled in a reasonably 
continuous operation; (ii) the original inspection certificates issued 
for the single lots have been surrendered to official personnel; (iii) 
representative file samples of the single lots are available; (iv) the 
grain in the single lots is of one grade and quality; (v) official 
personnel who performed the inspection service for the single lots and 
those who are to recertificate the grain as a combined lot determine 
that the samples used as a basis for the inspection of the grain in the 
single lots were representative at the time of sampling and have not 
changed in quality or condition; and (vi) the quality or condition of 
the grain meets uniformity requirements established by the Service for 
official inspection of grain in combined lots.
    (d) Weighted or mathematical average. Official factor and official 
criteria information shown on a certificate for grain in a combined lot 
shall, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (e) through (g) of this 
section, be based on the weighted or mathematical averages of the 
analysis of the sublots in the lot and shall be determined in accordance 
with the instructions.
    (e) Infested grain. If the grain in a combined lot is offered for 
official inspection as it is being loaded aboard a carrier and the 
grain, or a portion of the grain, in a lot is found to be infested, 
according to applicable provisions of the Official U.S. Standards for 
Grain, the applicant shall be notified and may exercise options 
specified in the instructions. When grain in railcars or trucks with 
permanently enclosed tops is considered infested, the applicant shall be 
given the option of (1) receiving a grade certificate with a special 
grade designation indicating that the entire lot is infested or (2) 
fumigating the grain in the lot in accordance with instructions and 
receiving a grade certificate without the special grade designation.
    (f) Grain uniform in quality. Samples obtained from grain officially 
inspected as a combined lot shall be examined for uniformity of quality. 
If the grain in the samples is found to be uniform in quality and the 
grain is loaded aboard or is unloaded from the carriers in a reasonably 
continuous operation, the grain in the combined lot shall be officially 
inspected and certificated as one lot. The requirements of this 
paragraph (f) and paragraph (c) of this section with respect to 
reasonably continuous loading or unloading do not apply to grain which 
is at rest in carriers when the grain is offered for inspection.
    (g) Grain not uniform in quality. When grain officially inspected as 
a combined lot is found to be not uniform in quality or if the grain is 
not loaded or unloaded in a reasonably continuous operation, the grain 
in each portion, and any grain which is loaded or unloaded at different 
times, shall be officially sampled, inspected, graded, and certificated 
as single lots.

[[Page 393]]

    (h) Special certification procedures. (1) Grain not uniform in 
quality. When grain in a combined lot is found to be not uniform in 
quality under paragraph (g) of this section, the official inspection 
certificate for each portion of different quality shall show (i) the 
grade, identification, and approximate quantity of the grain and (ii) 
other information required by the instructions.
    (2) Partial inspection. When an inbound movement of bulk grain is 
offered for official inspection at rest as a combined lot and all 
carriers are not fully accessible for sampling, the request for official 
inspection either shall be dismissed or a combined lot inspection shall 
be made on those carriers that are accessible. Those lots that are not 
accessible shall be handled in accordance with Sec. 800.84. If the 
request is for an official inspection service on an outbound movement of 
grain at rest in a combined lot, the request shall be dismissed on the 
ground that the grain is not accessible for a correct ``Out'' 
inspection.
    (3) Official mark. If grain in a combined lot is inspected for grade 
as it is being loaded aboard two or more carriers, upon request of the 
applicant, the following mark shall be shown on the inspection 
certificate: ``Loaded under continuous official inspection'' or ``Loaded 
under continuous official inspection and weighing.''
    (4) Combined-lot certification; general. Each official certificate 
for a combined-lot inspection service shall show the identification for 
the ``combined lot'' or, at the request of the applicant, the 
identification of each carrier in the combined lot. If the 
identification of each carrier is not shown, the statement ``Carrier 
identification available on official inspection log'' shall be shown on 
the inspection certificate in the space provided for remarks. The 
identification and any seal information for the carriers may be shown on 
the reverse side of the inspection certificate, provided the statement 
``See reverse side'' is shown on the face of the certificate in the 
space provided for remarks.
    (5) Recertification. If a request for a combined-lot inspection 
service is filed after the grain has been officially inspected and 
certificated as single lots, the combined-lot inspection certificate 
shall show (i) the date of inspection of the grain in the combined lot 
(if the single lots were inspected on different dates, the latest of the 
dates shall be shown); (ii) a serial number other than the serial 
numbers of the official inspection certificates that are to be 
superseded; (iii) the location of the grain, if at rest, or the name of 
the elevator from which or into which the grain in the combined lot was 
loaded or unloaded; (iv) a statement showing the approximate quantity of 
grain in the combined lot; (v) a completed statement showing the 
identification of any superseded certificates; and (vi) if at the time 
of issuing the combined-lot inspection certificate the superseded 
certificates are not in the custody of the official personnel, a 
statement indicating that the superseded certificates have not been 
surrendered shall be clearly shown in the space provided for remarks. If 
the superseded certificates are in the custody of official personnel, 
the superseded certificates shall be clearly marked ``Void.''
    (i) Further combining. After a combined-lot inspection certificate 
has been issued, there shall be no further combining and no dividing of 
the certificate.
    (j) Limitation. No combined-lot inspection certificate shall be 
issued (1) for any official inspection service other than as described 
in this section or (2) which shows a quantity of grain in excess of the 
quantity in the single lots.

Sec. 800.86  Inspection of shiplot, unit train, and lash barge grain in single lots.

    (a) General. Official inspection for grade of bulk or sacked grain 
aboard, or being loaded aboard, or being unloaded from a ship, unit 
train, or lash barges as a single lot shall be performed according to 
the provisions of this section and procedures prescribed in the 
instructions.
    (b) Application procedure. Applications for the official inspection 
of shiplot, unit train, and lash barges as a single lot shall:
    (1) Be filed in advance of loading or unloading;

[[Page 394]]

    (2) Show the estimated quantity of grain to be certificated;
    (3) Show the contract grade and official criteria if applicable; and
    (4) Identify the carrier and stowage area into which the grain is 
being loaded, or from which the grain is being unloaded, or in which the 
grain is at rest.
    (c) Inspection procedures. (1) General information. Shiplot, unit 
train, and lash barge grain officially inspected as a single lot shall 
be sampled in a reasonably continuous operation. Representative samples 
shall be obtained from the grain offered for inspection and inspected 
and graded in accordance with a statistical acceptance sampling and 
inspection plan according to the provisions of this section and 
procedures prescribed in the instructions.
    (2) Tolerances. The probability of accepting or rejecting portions 
of the lot during loading or unloading is dependent on inspection 
results obtained from preceding portions and the applied breakpoints and 
procedures. Breakpoints shall be periodically reviewed and revised based 
on new estimates of inspection variability. Tables 1 through 24 list the 
breakpoints for all grains.

    (3) Grain accepted by the inspection plan. Grain which is offered 
for inspection as part of a single lot and accepted by a statistical 
acceptance sampling and inspection plan according to the provisions of 
this section and procedures prescribed in the instructions shall be 
certificated as a single lot provided it was sampled in a reasonably 
continuous operation. Official factor and official criteria information 
shown on the certificate shall be based on the weighted or mathematical 
averages of the analysis of sublots.
    (4) Grain rejected by the inspection plan. When grain which is 
offered for inspection as part of a single lot is rejected by the plan 
or is not sampled in a reasonably continuous operation, the grain in 
each portion shall be certificated separately. If any portion of grain 
is not accepted by the plan and designated a material portion, the 
applicant shall be promptly notified and have the option of:
    (i) Removing the material portion from the carrier; or
    (ii) Requesting the material portion be separately certificated; or
    (iii) Requesting either a reinspection or an appeal inspection of 
the material portion; or
    (iv) Requesting a reinspection service and/or an appeal inspection 
service on the entire lot.

[[Page 400]]

    (5) Reinspection service and appeal inspection service. A 
reinspection or an appeal inspection may be requested on a material 
portion. A Board appeal inspection may also be requested on a material 
portion after the reinspection or appeal inspection. A reinspection, an 
appeal inspection, and a Board appeal inspection may be requested on the 
total sublots in the lot.
    (i) Material portions. A material portion designated by the plan may 
be reinspected or appeal inspected once in the field, but not both, and 
once at the Board of Appeals and Review. The reinspection or appeal 
inspection result shall, unless a material error is found, be averaged 
with the original inspection determination. The Board appeal inspection 
result shall, unless a material error is found, be averaged with the 
previous inspection result. The inspection plan tolerances shall be 
reapplied to the material portion grain to determine acceptance or 
rejection. If a material error is found, the reinspection or appeal 
inspection result shall replace the original inspection result or the 
Board appeal result shall replace the previous inspection result. For 
purposes of this section, a material error is defined as results 
differing by more than two standard deviations. Acceptance or rejection 
of that portion of grain shall be based on the reinspection or appeal 
inspection and on the Board appeal inspection result alone when a 
material error is found.
    (ii) Entire lot. The applicant may request a reinspection service, 
an appeal inspection service, and a Board appeal inspection service on 
the entire lot. Inspection results for these services shall replace the 
previous inspection results. The tolerances shall be reapplied to all 
portions of the entire lot to determine acceptance or rejection.
    (d) Infested grain. (1) Available options. If gain or any portion of 
grain in a single shiplot, unit train, or lash barge lot is found to be 
infested, according to the provisions of the Official U.S. Standards for 
Grain, the applicant shall be promptly notified and have the option of:
    (i) Unloading the portion of infested grain from the lot and an 
additional amount of other grain in common stowage with the infested 
grain; or
    (ii) When applicable, completing the loading and treating all 
infested grain in the lot; or
    (iii) When applicable, treating the infested grain for the purpose 
of destroying the insects, subject to subsequent examination by official 
personnel; or
    (iv) Continue loading without treating the infested grain, in which 
case all of the infested grain in the lot and all grain in common 
stowage areas with the infested grain will be officially certificated as 
infested according to the provisions of the Official U.S. Standards for 
Grain.
    (2) Exception. If infested grain in loaded into common stowage with 
a lot, or a portion of a lot, which has not been officially certificated 
as being infested, the applicant loading the infested grain may not use 
the option in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section.
    (3) With treatment. If infested grain is treated with a fumigant in 
accordance with the instructions and the treatment is witnessed by 
official personnel, the official sampling, inspection, grading, and 
certification of the lot shall continue as though the infested condition 
did not exist.
    (e) Special certification procedures. (1) Rejected grain. When grain 
is rejected by the inspection plan under paragraph (c)(4) of this

grain that was physically loaded on board. Upon request of the 
applicant, an additional certificate may be issued by the agency or the 
field office to show the weight of the additional grain that was used to 
replace a spill.
    (B) Not replaced. If a spill occurs in the handling and loading of 
outbound grain and the spilled grain is not retrieved or is not replaced 
during the loading operation, the weight certificate shall show the 
weight of the grain that was actually weighed, minus the estimated 
amount of the grain that was spilled. Upon request of the applicant, an 
additional certificate may be issued showing the estimated amount of 
grain that was spilled. The applicant may, upon request, have the total 
amount that was weighed shown on the weight certificate with the 
estimated amount of the spilled grain noted.
    (ii) Inbound. If a spill occurs in the handling of inbound grain and

Class Y weighing service is filed after the grain in the single lots has 
been weighed and certificated, the combined-lot weighing certificate 
shall show (i) the date of weighing the grain in the combined lot (if 
the single lots were weighed on different dates, the latest of the dates 
shall be shown); (ii) a serial number, other than the serial numbers of 
the weight certificates that are to be superseded; (iii) the name of the 
elevator from which or into which the grain in the combined lot was 
loaded or unloaded; (iv) a statement showing the weight of the grain in 
the combined lot; (v) a completed statement showing the identification 
of any superseded certificate as follows: ``This combined-lot 
certificate supersedes certificate Nos. ----, dated ----; and (vi) if at 
the time of issuing the combined-lot weight certificate the superseded 
certificates are not in the custody of the agency or field office, the 
statement ``The superseded certificates identified herein have not been 
surrendered'' shall be clearly shown, in the space provided for remarks, 
beneath the statement identifying the superseded certificates. If the 
superseded certificates are in the custody of the agency or field 
office, the superseded certificates shall be clearly marked ``Void.''
    (3) Part lot. If a part of a combined lot of grain in inbound 
carriers is unloaded and a part is left in the carriers, the grain that 
is unloaded shall be certificated in accordance with the provisions in 
Sec. 800.97(c)(2).

grain to determine the weight of the grain shall be made on the basis of 
one or more official weight samples obtained from the grain by official 
personnel according to this section and procedures prescribed in the 
instructions.
    (b) Representative sample. No official weight sample shall be 
considered to be representative of a lot of sacked grain unless the 
sample is of the size prescribed in the instructions and has been 
obtained and weighed according to the procedures prescribed in the 
instructions.
    (c) Protecting samples and data. Official personnel and other 
employees of an agency or the Service shall protect official weight 
samples and data from manipulation, substitution, and improper and 
careless handling which might deprive the samples and sample data of 
their representativeness.
    (d) Restriction on weighing. No agency shall weigh any lot of sacked 
grain unless at the time of obtaining the official weight sample the 
grain from which the sample was obtained was located within the area of 
responsibility assigned to the agency. Upon good cause shown by the

Sec. 800.129  Certificating reinspection and review of weighing results.

    (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
paragraph, official certificates shall be issued according to 
Sec. 800.160 and the instructions. Except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, only the result of the reinspection service 
shall be reported.

[[Page 408]]

    (1) Results of material portion sublots. When results of a 
reinspection on a material portion do not detect a material error, they 
shall be averaged with the original inspection results. For purposes of 
this section, a material error is defined as results differing by more 
than two standard deviations. The averaged inspection results shall 
replace the original inspection results recorded on the official 
inspection log. Reinspection results shall replace the original 
inspection results recorded on the official inspection log if a material 
error is detected. No certificates will be issued unless requested by 
the applicant or deemed necessary by official personnel.
    (2) Reporting review of weighing results. When the review of 
weighing service results indicate that the original weighing results 
were correct, the applicant will be notified in writing. When the 
original weighing service results are incorrect, a corrected weight 
certificate or, if applicable, a corrected combination inspection and 
Class X weight certificate will be issued according to the provisions of 
Sec. 800.165.
    (b) Required statements on reinspection certificates. Each 
reinspection certificate shall show the statements required by this 
section, Sec. 800.161, and applicable instructions.
    (1) Each reinspection certificate must clearly show (i) the term 
``Reinspection'' and (ii) a statement identifying the superseded 
certificate. The superseded certificate will be considered null and void 
as of the date of the reinspection certificate.
    (2) When official grade or official factors, Class X weighing 
results, and official criteria are reported on the same certificate, the 
reinspection certificate shall show a statement indicating that the 
reinspection results are based on official grade, or official factors, 
or official criteria and that all other results are those of the 
original service.
    (3) If the superseded certificate is in the custody of the agency or 
field office, the superseded certificate shall be marked ``Void.'' If 
the superseded certificate is not in the custody of the agency or field 
office at the time the reinspection certificate is issued, a statement 
indicating that the superseded certificate has not been surrendered 
shall be shown on the reinspection certificate.
    (4) As of the date of issuance of the official certificate, the 
superseded certificate for the original service will be void and shall 
not be used to represent the grain.
    (5) When certificates are issued under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, the reinspection certificate shall show a statement indicating 
that the results replaced the original results and that the reinspection 
certificate is not valid for trading purposes.

                       Appeal Inspection Services


<R05>
Sec. 800.135  Who may request appeal inspection services.

    (a) General. Any interested person may request appeal inspection or 
Board appeal inspection services, except as provided for in 
Sec. 800.86(c)(5). When more than one interested person requests an 
appeal inspection or Board appeal inspection service, the first person 
to file is the applicant of record. Only one appeal inspection may be 
obtained from any original inspection or reinspection service. Only one 
Board appeal inspection may be obtained from an appeal inspection. Board 
appeal inspections will be performed on the basis of the official file 
sample. Board appeal inspections are not available on stowage 
examination services.
    (b) Kind and scope of request. The kind and scope of an appeal 
inspection service will be limited to the kind and scope of the original 
inspection, or reinspection, or, in the case of a Board appeal 
inspection service, the appeal inspection service. If the request 
specifies a different kind or scope, the request shall be dismissed. It 
may, however, be resubmitted as a request for original services. 
Official criteria is considered separately from official grade or 
official factors when determining kind and scope. When requested, an 
appeal inspection for grade, or official factors, and official criteria 
may be handled separately even though both results are reported on the 
same certificate. Moreover, an appeal inspection may be requested on the 
inspection results when both inspection and

[[Page 409]]

Class X weighing results are reported on a combination inspection and 
Class X weight certificate. An appeal inspection for grade shall include 
a review of all official factors that (1) may determine the grade; or 
(2) are reported on the original, reinspection, or in the case of a 
Board appeal inspection, the appeal inspection certificate; and (3) are 
required to be shown on a certificate of grade.

Sec. 800.136  How to request appeal inspection services.

    (a) General. Requests shall be filed with the field office 
responsible for the area in which the original service was performed. 
Requests for Board appeal inspections may be filed with the Board of 
Appeals and Review or the field office that performed the appeal 
inspection. All requests shall include the information specified in 
Sec. 800.46. Verbal requests shall be confirmed in writing when 
requested by official personnel as specified in Sec. 800.46. Copies of 
request forms may be obtained from the field office upon request. If at 
the time the request is filed the documentation required by Sec. 800.46 
is not available, official personnel may, at their discretion, withhold 
service pending the receipt of the required documentation. An appeal 
inspection certificate will not be issued unless (1) documentation 
requested under Sec. 800.46 has been submitted or (2) office personnel 
determine that sufficient information has been made available so as to 
perform the request. A record that sufficient information has been made 
available must be included in the record of the official service.
    (b) Filing requirements. Requests will be considered filed on the 
date they are received by official personnel. A record shall be 
maintained for all requests. Requests must be filed (1) before the grain 
has left the specified service point where the grain was located when 
the original inspection was performed, (2) no later than the close of 
business on the second business day following the date of the last 
inspection, and (3) before the identity of the grain has been lost. If a 
representative file sample as prescribed in Sec. 800.82 is available, 
official personnel may waive the requirements pursuant to this 
paragraph. The requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be 
waived only upon written consent of the applicant and all interested 
persons. The requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this 
section may be waived at the request of the applicant or other 
interested persons. The requirement of paragraph (b)(2) of this section 
may also be waived upon satisfactory showing by an interested person of 
evidence of fraud or that because of distance or other good cause, the 
time allowed for filing was not sufficient. A record of each waiver 
shall be included in the record of the appeal inspection service.

certificate, the superseded certificate for the original, reinspection, 
or appeal inspection service will be void and shall not be used to 
represent the grain.
    (5) When certificates are issued under paragraph (b) of this 
section, the appeal inspection certificate shall show a statement 
indicating that the results replace the original inspection, 
reinspection, or, in the case of a Board appeal, the appeal inspection 
results and that the appeal inspection certificate is not valid for 
trading purposes.
    (d) Finality of Board appeal inspections. A Board appeal inspection 
will be the final appeal inspection service.

his/her views on the proposed action in an informal manner, or (ii) at

<R05>
Sec. 800.187  Conflicts of interest

    (a) General. Warehouse samplers are exempt from the conflict-of-
interest provisions of this section.
    (b) What constitutes a gratuity. For the purposes of these 
regulations, the term ``gratuity'' shall include any favor, 
entertainment, gift, tip, loan, payment for unauthorized or fictitious 
work, unusual discount, or anything of monetary value. The term shall 
not include (1) the occasional exchange of a cup of coffee or similar 
social courtesies of nominal value in a business or work relationship if 
the exchange is wholly free of any embarrassing or improper 
implications; (2) the acceptance of unsolicited advertising material 
such as pencils, pens, and note pads of nominal value if the material is 
wholly free of any embarrassing or improper implications; and (3) the 
exchange of the usual courtesies in an obvious family or personal 
relationship (including those between official personnel and their 
parents, spouses, children, or close personal friends) when the 
circumstances make it clear that the exchange is the result of the 
family or personal relationship, rather than a business or work 
relationship.
    (c) Conflicts. In addition to the conflicts of interest prohibited 
by section 11 of the Act, the activities specified in this paragraph 
shall also be considered

[[Page 426]]

to be a conflict of interest. Accordingly, no official personnel shall, 
during the term of their license or authorization (including any period 
of suspension):
    (1) Accept any gratuity.
    (2) Accept any fee or charge or other thing of monetary value, in 
addition to the published fee or charge, for the performance of official 
inspection or weighing services under circumstances in which the 
acceptance could result, or create the appearance of resulting, in (i) 
the use of their office or position for undue private gain, (ii) an 
undertaking to give undue preferential treatment to any group or any 
person, or (iii) any other loss of independence or impartiality in the 
performance of official inspection or Class X or Class Y weighing 
services.
    (3) Knowingly perform, or participate in performing, an inspection 
or weighing service on grain in which they have a direct or indirect 
financial interest.
    (4) Engage in the business by buying, selling, transporting, 
cleaning, elevating, storing, binning, mixing, blending, drying, 
treating, fumigating, or other preparation of grain (other than a grower 
of grain, or in the disposition of inspection samples); or in the 
business of cleaning, treating, or fitting carriers or containers for 
transporting or storing grain; the merchandising for nonfarm use of 
equipment for cleaning, drying, treating, fumigating, or otherwise 
processing, handling, or storing grain; or the merchandising of grain 
inspection or weighing equipment (other than buying or selling by 
official personnel of the equipment for use in the performance of their 
official services).
    (5) Seek or hold any appointive or elective office in a grain 
industry organization or association. This provision does not apply to 
organizations of official inspectors or official weighers.
    (6) Participate in any transaction involving the purchase or sale of 
corporate stocks or bonds, grain or grain-related commodities, or other 
property for speculative or income purposes if the transaction could 
reasonably be construed to interfere with the proper and impartial 
performance of official inspection for Class X or Class Y weighing 
services. Official personnel are not prohibited from (i) producing grain 
as a grower and selling the grain; (ii) making bona fide investments in 
governmental obligations, banking institutions, savings and loan 
associations, and other tangibles and intangibles that are clearly not 
involved in the production, transportation, storage, marketing, or 
processing of grain; or (iii) borrowing money from banks or other 
financial institutions on customary terms.
    (d) Reports of interests. Official personnel shall report 
information regarding their employment or other business or financial 
interests which may be required by the Service.
    (e) Avoiding conflicts of interest. Official personnel shall not 
acquire any financial interest or engage in any activity that would 
result in a violation of this Sec. 800.187, or Sec. 800.186, or section 
11 of the Act and shall not permit their spouses, minor children, or 
blood relatives who reside in their immediate households to acquire any 
such interest or engage in any such activity. For the purpose of this 
section, the interest of a spouse, minor child, or blood relative who is 
a resident of the immediate household of official personnel shall be 
considered to be an interest of the official personnel.
    (f) Disposing of a conflict of interest--(1) Remedial action. Upon 
being informed that a conflict of interest exists and that remedial 
action is required, an applicant for a license and official personnel 
shall take immediate action to end the conflict of interest and inform 
the Service of the action taken.
    (2) Hardship cases. Applicants and official personnel who believe 
that remedial action will cause undue personal hardship may request an 
exception by forwarding to the Service a written statement setting forth 
the facts, circumstances, and reasons for requesting an exception.
    (3) Failure to terminate. If a final determination is made by the 
Service that a conflict of interest does exist and should not be 
excepted, failure to terminate the conflict of interest shall subject: 
(i) An applicant for a license to a dismissal of the application; (ii) 
An employee of the Service to disciplinary

[[Page 427]]

action; and (iii) A licensee to license revocation.

reason(s) for the dismissal.

[[Page 428]]

locations in the State. The State shall perform each official service 
according to the Act, regulations, and instructions.
    (2) Staffing, licensing, and training. Delegated States shall employ 
official personnel on the basis of job qualifications rather than 
political affiliations. The State shall employ sufficient personnel to 
provide the services normally requested in an accurate and timely 
manner. The State shall only use personnel licensed by the Service for 
the performance of official services and shall train and assist its 
personnel in acquiring and maintaining the necessary skills. The State

licensees and any substantial change in a licensee's duties.
    (3) Rotation of personnel. Where feasible, each delegated State

weighting systems.
    (4) Supervision. The State and its officials shall be responsible 
for the actions of the official personnel employed by the State, for 
direct supervision of the daily activities of such personnel, and for 
the conduct of official services and related activities in the State. 
The State shall supervise official activities according to the Act, 
regulations, and instructions and shall take action necessary to ensure 
that its employees are not performing prohibited functions and are not 
involved in any action prohibited by the Act, regulations, or 
instructions. Each State shall report to the Service information which 
shows or may show a violation of any provision of the Act, regulations, 
or instructions and information on any instructions which have been

which are contrary to or inconsistent with the Act, regulations, or 
instructions.
    (5) Conflict of interest. (i) General. The delegated State and any 
commissioner, director, employee, or other related person or entity 
shall not have a conflict of interest, as defined in section 11 of the 
Act and Sec. 800.199 of the regulations. A conflict of interest may be 
waived pursuant to Sec. 800.199(d).

a certificate control system for all official certificates it receives, 
issues, voids, or otherwise renders useless. The system shall provide 
for: (i) Recording the numbers of the official certificates printed or 
received; (ii) protecting unused certificates from fraudulent or 
unauthorized use; and (iii) maintaining a file copy of each certificate 
issued, voided, or otherwise rendered useless in a manner that would 
permit retrieval.
    (10) Records. Each delegated State shall maintain the records 
specified in Secs. 800.145 through 800.159.
    (g) Termination. (1) Automatic termination. Failure to pay the user 
fees prescribed by the Service for supervisory costs related to official 
inspection and weighing services within 30 days after due shall result 
in the automatic termination of the delegation. The delegation shall be 
reinstated if fees currently due, plus interest and any further expenses 
incurred by the Service because of the termination, are paid within 60 
days after the termination.

[[Page 429]]

    (2) Voluntary cancellation. A State may request that its delegation 
be canceled by giving 90 days written notice to the Service.
    (3) Revocation. (i) Without hearing. The Administrator may revoke 
the delegation of a State without first affording the State opportunity 
for a hearing. Unless otherwise provided, the revocation shall be 
effective when the State receives a notice from the Service regarding 
the revocation and the reason(s) therefor.
    (ii) Informal conference. At the discretion of the Administrator, 
before the delegation of a State is revoked under paragraph (g)(3)(i) of

opportunity to express its views in an informal conference before the 
Administrator.

    (b) Restrictions. (1) General. If official inspection services are 
performed in an area by a designated agency, Class X and Class Y 
weighing services in that area may be performed only by the designated 
agency if the agency applies for designation to provide weighing 
services and is found qualified by the Service. If the agency designated 
to provide official inspection services is found not qualified or does

perform official services outside its assigned area on an interim basis 
when authorized by the Service.
    (ii) By Service. Official inspection services and/or Class X and

Class Y weighing services in a given area (other than export port 
locations) in the United States.
    (d) When and how to apply. An application for designation should be 
filed with the Service, according to the provisions of the Federal 
Register notice which requests applicants for designation to perform 
official services in existing or new geographic areas. The application 
for designation: (1) Shall be submitted on a form furnished by the 
Service; (2) shall be typewritten or legibly written in English; (3) 
shall show or be accompanied by documents which show all information 
requested on the form, or otherwise required by the Service; and (4) 
shall be signed by the applicant or its chief operating officer.
    (e) Review of conditions and criteria for designation. (1) 
Application. Each application for a designation shall be reviewed to 
determine whether it complies with paragraph (d) of this section. If an 
application is not in compliance, the applicant shall be provided an 
opportunity to submit the needed information. If the needed information 
is not submitted within a reasonable time, as determined by the Service, 
the application may be dismissed. When an application is dismissed, the 
Service shall notify the applicant, in writing, of the reason(s) for the 
dismissal.
    (2) Applicant. Each applicant for authority to operate as as 
designated agency shall be reviewed to determine

[[Page 430]]

whether the applicant meets the conditions and criteria contained in 
sections 7(f)(1)(A) and (B) of the Act, Sec. 800.199 of the regulations, 
and paragraph (g) of this section. The requested designation may be 
granted if the Service determines that: (i) The requested action is 
consistent with the need for official services; (ii) the applicant meets 
the conditions and criteria specified in the Act and regulations; and 
(iii) the applicant is better able than any other applicant to provide 
official services.
    (f) Area of responsibility. (1) General. Each agency shall be 
assigned an area of responsibility by the Service. Each area shall be 
identified by geographical boundaries and, in the case of a State or 
local government, shall not exceed the jurisdictional boundaries of the 
State or the local government, unless otherwise approved by the Service. 
The area of responsibility may not include any export elevators at 
export port locations or any portion of an area of responsibility 
assigned to another agency that is performing the same functions. A 
designated agency may perform official services at locations outside its 
assigned area of responsibility only after obtaining approval from the 
Service.
    (2) Amending. A request for an amendment to an assigned area of 
responsibility shall (i) be submitted to the Service in writing; (ii) 
specify the change desired; (iii) be signed by the applicant or its 
chief operating officer; and (iv) be accompanied by the fee prescribed 
by the Service. The assigned area may be amended if the Service 
determines that the amendment is consistent with the provisions and 
objectives of the Act, regulations, and instructions. Upon a finding of 
need, the Service may initiate action to change an assigned area of 
responsibility.
    (3) Specified service points. An agency may change its specified 
service points by notifying the Service in advance. Interested persons 
may obtain a list of specified service points within an agency's area of 
responsibility by contacting the agency. The list shall include all 
specified service points and shall identify each specified service point 
which operates on an intermittent or seasonal basis.
    (g) Responsibilities. (1) Providing official services. Insofar as 
practicable, each agency shall be responsible for providing at all 
locations in its assigned area each service authorized by the 
designation. An agency may, subject to Service approval, make 
arrangements with a neighboring agency to provide official services 
requested infrequently. The agency shall perform all official services 
according to the Act, regulations, and instructions in effect at the 
time of designation or which may be promulgated subsequently.
    (2) Fees. The agency shall charge fees according to Sec. 800.70.
    (3) Staffing, licensing, and training. (i) General. The agency shall 
employ sufficient personnel to provide the official services normally 
requested in an accurate and timely manner. Each agency shall only use 
personnel licensed by the Service for the performance of official 
services and shall train and assist its personnel in acquiring and 
maintaining the necessary skills. Each agency shall keep the Service 
informed of the employment status of each of its licensees and any 
substantial change in a licensee's duties.
    (ii) State agencies. State agencies shall employ official personnel 
on the basis of job qualifications rather than political affiliations.
    (4) Rotation of personnel. Where feasible, each agency shall rotate 
licensees among elevators and other facilities as is necessary to 
preserve the integrity of the official inspection and weighing systems.
    (5) Supervision. The agency and its officials shall be responsible 
for the actions of the official personnel employed by the agency, for 
direct supervision of the daily activities of such personnel, and for 
the conduct of official services and related activities at the agency. 
The agency shall supervise official activities, in accordance with the 
Act, regulations, and instructions, and shall take action necessary to 
ensure that its employees are not performing prohibited functions and 
are not involved in any action prohibited by the Act, regulations, or 
instructions. Each agency shall report to the responsible field office 
information which shows or may show a violation of any provision of the 
Act, regulations, or instructions and information on any instructions

[[Page 431]]

which have been issued to agency personnel by Service personnel or by 
any other person which are inconsistent with the Act, regulations, or 
instructions.
    (6) Conflict of interest. (i) General. Each agency and any officer, 
director, stockholder, employee, or other related entity shall not have 
a conflict of interest, as defined in Section 11 of the Act and 
Sec. 800.199 of the regulations. A conflict of interest may be waived 
pursuant to Sec. 800.199(d). The agency shall advise the Service 
immediately of any proposed change in name, ownership, officers or 
directors, or control of the agency and, if a trust, any change 
affecting the trust agreement.
    (ii) Unofficial activities. Except as provided in Sec. 800.76(a), 
the agency or personnel employed by the agency shall not perform any 
unofficial service that is the same as the official services covered by 
the designation.
    (7) Facilities and equipment. (i) General. The laboratory and office 
facilities of each agency shall be: Located; equipped; and large enough 
so that requested services are provided in an orderly and timely manner.
    (ii) Equipment testing. Each agency shall test the equipment it uses 
for official services according to the instructions.
    (8) Security. Each agency shall provide sufficient security to 
ensure that official samples, records, equipment, and forms are 
reasonably secure from theft, alteration, or misuse.
    (9) Certificate control system. Each agency shall establish a 
certificate control system for all official certificates it receives, 
issues, voids, or otherwise renders useless. The system shall provide 
for (i) recording the numbers of the official certificates printed or 
received; (ii) protecting unused certificates from fraudulent or 
unauthorized use; and (iii) maintaining a file copy of each certificate 
issued, voided, or otherwise rendered useless in a manner that would 
permit retrieval.
    (10) Records. Each agency shall maintain the records specified in 
Secs. 800.145 through 800.159.

designation shall terminate at a time specified by the Administrator, 
but not later than 3 years after the effective date of the designation. 
A notice of triennial termination shall be issued by the Service to a 
designated agency at least 120 calendar days in advance of the 
termination date. The notice shall provide instructions for requesting 
renewal of the designation. Failure to receive a notice from the Service 
shall not exempt a designated agency from the responsibility of having 
its designation renewed on or before the specified termination date.
    (ii) Renewal. Designations may be renewed, upon application, in 
accordance with criteria and procedures for designation prescribed in 
section 7(f) of the Act and this section of the regulations. The 
Administrator may decline to renew a designation if: (A) The requesting 
agency fails to meet or comply with any of the criteria for designation 
set forth in the Act, regulations, and instructions, of (B) the 
Administrator determines that another qualified applicant is better able 
to provide official services in the assigned area.
    (2) Automatic termination. Failure to pay the user fees prescribed 
by the Service for supervisory costs related to official inspection and 
weighing services within 30 days after due shall result in the automatic 
termination of the designation. The designation shall be reinstated if 
fees currently due, plus interest and any further expenses incurred by 
the Service because of the termination, are paid within 60 days after 
the termination.
    (3) Voluntary cancellation. An agency may request that its 
designation be canceled by giving 90 days written notice to the Service.
    (4) Suspension or revocation of designation. (i) General. A 
designation is subject to suspension or revocation, under section 
7(g)(3) of the Act, by the Service, whenever the Administrator 
determines that: (A) The agency has failed to meet one or more of the 
criteria specified in section 7(f) of the Act or the regulations for the 
performance of official functions, or otherwise has not complied with 
any provision of the Act, regulations, or instructions, or (B) has been 
convicted of any violation of other Federal law involving the handling 
or official inspection of grain.

[[Page 432]]

    (ii) Summary suspension. The Service may, without first affording 
the agency (hereafter referred to in this paragraph as the 
``respondent'') an opportunity for a hearing, suspend a designation or 
refuse to reinstate a designation when the suspension period has 
expired, pending final determination of the proceeding whenever the 
Service has reason to believe there is cause for revocation of the 
designation and considers such action to be in the best interest of the 
official inspection and weighing system. A suspension or refusal to 
reinstate a suspended designation shall be effective upon the 
respondent's receipt of a notice from the Service. Within 30 calendar 
days following the issuance of a notice of such action, the Service 
shall afford the respondent an opportunity for a hearing under paragraph 
(h)(4)(iii) of this section. The Service may terminate the action if it 
finds that alternative managerial, staffing, financial, or operational 
arrangements satisfactory to the Service can be and are made by the 
respondent.
    (iii) Other than summary suspension. Except as provided in paragraph 
(h)(4)(ii) of the section, before the Service revokes or suspends a 
designation, the respondent shall be: (A) Notified by the Service of the 
proposed action and the reason(s) therefor, and (B) afforded an 
opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the Rules of Practice 
Governing Formal Adjudicatory Proceedings Instituted by the Secretary 
Under Various Statutes (7 CFR part 1, subpart H). Before initiating 
formal adjudicatory proceedings, the Service may, at its discretion, 
afford the respondent an opportunity to present its views on the 
proposed action and the reason(s) therefor in an informal conference. 
If, as a result of the informal conference, a consent agreement is 
reached, no formal adjudicatory proceedings shall be initiated.
    (i) Provision of services following suspension or termination. If 
the designation of an agency is suspended, terminated, or the renewal of 
a designation is not granted, the Service shall attempt, upon a finding 
of need, to arrange for a replacement agency. If a qualified replacement 
agency cannot be designated on a timely basis, a qualified agency, if 
available, shall be designated on an interim basis. If a qualified 
agency is not available on an interim basis, the Service shall provide 
needed services on an interim basis.

seq.).


<R05>
Sec. 802.0  Applicability.

    (a) The requirements set forth in this part 802 describe certain 
specifications, tolerances, and other technical requirements for grain 
weighing equipment and related grain handling systems used in performing 
Class X and Class Y weighing services, official inspection services, and 
commercial services under the Act. All scales used for official grain 
weight and inspection certification services provided by FGIS shall meet 
applicable requirements contained in the FGIS Weighing Handbook, the 
General Code, the Scales Code, the Automatic Bulk Weighing Systems Code, 
and the Weights Code of the 1994 edition of National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) Handbook 44, ``Specifications, 
Tolerances, and Other Technical Requirements for Weighing and Measuring 
Devices'' (Handbook 44); and NIST HANDBOOK 105-1 (1990 Edition), 
``Specifications and Tolerances for Reference Standards and Field 
Standard Weights and Measures'' (Handbook 105-1). These requirements are 
confirmed to be met by having National Type Evaluation Program or 
Federal Grain Inspection Service type approval. Scales used for 
commercial purposes will be required to meet only the applicable 
requirements of the 1994 edition of the NIST Handbook-44. Pursuant to 
the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(a), with the exception of the Handbook 44 
requirements listed in paragraph (b) of this section, the materials in 
Handbooks 44 and 105-1 are incorporated by reference as they exist on

                      Subpart A--General Provisions

    Note: Compliance with the provisions of these standards does not 
excuse failure to comply with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act, or other Federal laws.

                              Terms Defined


<R05>
Sec. 810.101  Grains for which standards are established.

    Grain refers to barley, canola, corn, flaxseed, mixed grain, oats, 
rye, sorghum, soybeans, sunflower seed, triticale, and wheat. Standards 
for these food grains, feed grains, and oilseeds are established under 
the United States Grain Standards Act.

[57 FR 3274, Jan. 29, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 810.102  Definition of other terms.

    Unless otherwise stated, the definitions in this section apply to 
all grains. All other definitions unique to a particular grain are 
contained in the appropriate subpart for that grain.
    (a) Distinctly low quality. Grain that is obviously of inferior 
quality because it is in an unusual state or condition, and that cannot 
be graded properly by use of other grading factors provided in the 
standards. Distinctly low quality includes the presence of any objects 
too large to enter the sampling device; i.e., large stones, wreckage, or 
similar objects.
    (b) Moisture. Water content in grain as determined by an approved 
device according to procedures prescribed in FGIS instructions.
    (c) Stones. Concreted earthy or mineral matter and other substances 
of similar hardness that do not disintegrate in water.
    (d) Test weight per bushel. The weight per Winchester bushel 
(2,150.42 cubic inches) as determined using an approved device according 
to procedures prescribed in FGIS instructions. Test weight per bushel in 
the standards for corn, mixed grain, oats, sorghum, and soybeans is 
determined on the original sample. Test weight per bushel in the

[[Page 446]]

standards for barley, flaxseed, rye, sunflower seed, triticale, and 
wheat is determined after mechanically cleaning the original sample. 
Test weight per bushel is recorded to the nearest tenth pound for corn, 
rye, triticale, and wheat. Test weight per bushel for all other grains, 
if applicable, is recorded in whole and half pounds with a fraction of a 
half pound disregarded. Test weight per bushel is not an official factor 
for canola.
    (e) Whole kernels. Grain with \1/4\ or less of the kernel removed.

            Principles Governing the Application of Standards


<R05>
Sec. 810.103  Basis of determination.

    (a) Distinctly low quality. The determination of distinctly low 
quality is made on the basis of the lot as a whole at the time of 
sampling when a condition exists that may or may not appear in the 
representative sample and/or the sample as a whole.
    (b) Certain quality determinations. Each determination of rodent 
pellets, bird droppings, other animal filth, broken glass, castor beans, 
cockleburs, crotalaria seeds, dockage, garlic, live insect infestation, 
large stones, moisture, temperature, an unknown foreign substance(s), 
and a commonly recognized harmful or toxic substance(s) is made on the 
basis of the sample as a whole. When a condition exists that may not 
appear in the representative sample, the determination may be made on 
the basis of the lot as a whole at the time of sampling according to 
procedures prescribed in FGIS instructions.
    (c) All other determinations. The basis of determination for all 
other factors is contained in the individual standards.


<R05>
Sec. 810.104  Percentages.

    (a) Rounding. Percentages are determined on the basis of weight and 
are rounded as follows:
    (1) When the figure to be rounded is followed by a figure greater 
than or equal to 5, round to the next higher figure; e.g., report 6.36 
as 6.4, 0.35 as 0.4, and 2.45 as 2.5.
    (2) When the figure to be rounded is followed by a figure less than 
5, retain the figure; e.g., report 8.34 as 8.3, and 1.22 as 1.2.
    (b) Recording. The percentage of dockage in flaxseed and sorghum is 
reported in whole percent with fractions of a percent being disregarded. 
Dockage in barley and triticale is reported in whole and half percent 
with a fraction less than one-half percent being disregarded. Dockage in 
wheat and rye is reported in whole and tenth percents to the nearest 
tenth percent. Foreign material in sunflower seed is reported to the 
nearest one-half percent. Ranges of sunflower seed foreign material are 
reported as follows: 0.0 to 0.24 is reported as 0.0 percent, 0.25 to 
0.74 as 0.5 percent, 0.75 to 1.24 as 1.0 percent, and the like. Foreign 
material and fines in mixed grain is reported in whole percent. The 
percentage of smut in barley, sclerotinia and stones in canola, and 
ergot in all grains is reported to the nearest hundredth percent. The 
percentage when determining the identity of all grains is reported to 
the nearest whole percent. Also reported to the nearest whole percent 
are the classes and subclasses in wheat; flint corn; flint and dent 
corn; waxy corn; classes in barley; and the percentage of each kind of 
grain in mixed grain. Plump barley shall be expressed in terms of the 
range in which it falls. Ranges shall be: Below 50 percent, 50 to 55 
percent, 56 to 60 percent, 61 to 65 percent, and the like. All other 
percentages are reported in tenths percent.

     Special Grades, Special Grade Requirements, and Special Grade 
                              Designations


<R05>
Sec. 810.107  Special grades and special grade requirements.

    A special grade serves to draw attention to a special factor or 
condition present in the grain and, when applicable, is supplemental to 
the grade assigned under Sec. 810.106. Except for the special grade 
``infested,'' the special grades are identified and requirements are 
established in each respective grain standards.
    (a) Infested wheat, rye, and triticale. Tolerances for live insects 
responsible for infested wheat, rye, and triticale are defined according 
to sampling designations as follows:
    (1) Representative sample. The representative sample consists of the 
work portion, and the file sample if needed and when available. These 
grains will be considered infested if the representative sample (other 
than shiplots) contains two or more live weevils, or one live weevil and 
one or more other live insects injurious to stored grain, or two or more 
live insects injurious to stored grain.
    (2) Lot as a whole (stationary). The lot as a whole is considered 
infested when two or more live weevils, or one live weevil and one or 
more other live insects injurious to stored grain, or two or more other 
live insects injurious to stored grain are found in, on, or about the 
lot (excluding submitted samples and shiplots).
    (3) Sample as a whole (continuous loading/unloading of shiplots and 
bargelots). The minimum sample size for bargelots and shiplots is 500 
grams per each 2,000 bushels of grain. The sample as a whole is 
considered infested when a component (as defined in FGIS instructions) 
contains two or more live weevils, or one live weevil and one or more 
other live insects injurious to stored grain, or two or more other live 
insects injurious to stored grain.
    (b) Infested barley, canola, corn, oats, sorghum, soybeans, 
sunflower seed, and mixed grain. Tolerances for live insects responsible 
for infested barley, canola, corn, oats, sorghum, soybeans, sunflower 
seed, and mixed grain are defined according to sampling designations as 
follows:
    (1) Representative sample. The representative sample consists of the 
work portion, and the file sample if needed and when available. These 
grains will be considered infested if the representative sample (other 
than shiplots) contains two or more live weevils, or one

[[Page 448]]

live weevil and five or more other live insects injurious to stored 
grain, or ten or more other live insects injurious to stored grain.
    (2) Lot as a whole (stationary). The lot as a whole is considered 
infested when two or more live weevils, or one live weevil and five or 
more other live insects injurious to stored grain, or ten or more other 
live insects injurious to stored grain are found in, on, or about the 
lot (excluding submitted samples and shiplots).
    (3) Sample as a whole (continuous loading/unloading of shiplots and 
bargelots). The minimum sample for shiplots and bargelots is 500 grams 
per each 2,000 bushels of grain. The sample as a whole is considered 
infested when a component (as defined in FGIS instructions) contains two 
or more live weevils, or one live weevil and five or more other live 
insects injurious to stored grain, or ten or more other live insects 
injurious to stored grain.

                              Terms Defined


<R05>
Sec. 810.201  Definition of barley.

    Grain that, before the removal of dockage, consists of 50 percent or 
more of whole kernels of cultivated barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and not 
more than 25 percent of other grains for which standards have been 
established under the United States Grain Standards Act. The term 
``barley'' as used in these standards does not include hull-less barley 
or black barley.


<R05>
Sec. 810.202  Definition of other terms.

    (a) Black barley. Barley with black hulls.
    (b) Broken kernels. Barley with more than \1/4\ of the kernel 
removed.
    (c) Classes. There are two classes of barley: Malting barley and

    (1) Malting barley. Barley of a six-rowed or two-rowed malting type. 
The class Malting barley is divided into the following three subclasses:
    (i) Six-rowed Malting barley. Barley that has a minimum of 95.0 
percent of a six-rowed suitable malting type that has 90.0 percent or 
more of kernels with white aleurone layers that contains not more than 
1.9 percent injured-by-frost kernels, 0.4 percent frost-damaged kernels, 
0.2 percent injured-by-heat kernels, and 0.1 percent heat-damaged 
kernels. Six-rowed Malting barley shall not be infested, blighted,

percent of a two-rowed suitable malting type that contains not more than 
1.9 percent injured-by-frost kernels, 0.4 percent frost-damaged kernels, 
0.2 percent injured-by-heat kernels, 0.1 percent heat-damaged kernels, 
1.9 percent injured-by-mold kernels, and 0.4 percent mold-damaged 
kernels. Two-rowed Malting barley shall not be infested, blighted, 
ergoty, garlicky, or smutty as defined in Sec. 810.107(b) and

            Principles Governing the Application of Standards


<R05>
Sec. 810.203  Basis of determination.

    All other determinations. Each determination of heat-damaged 
kernels, injured-by-heat kernels, and white or blue aleurone layers in 
Six-rowed barley is made on pearled, dockage-free barley. Other 
determinations not specifically provided for under the General 
Provisions are made on the basis of the grain when free from dockage, 
except the determination of odor is made on either the basis of the 
grain as a whole or the grain when free from dockage.

Sec. 810.301  Definition of canola.

    Seeds of the genus Brassica from which the oil shall contain less 
than 2 percent erucic acid in its fatty acid profile and the solid 
component shall contain less than 30.0 micromoles of any one or any 
mixture of 3-butenyl glucosinolate, 4-pentenyl glucosinolate, 2-hydroxy-
3-butenyl, or 2-hydroxy-4-pentenyl glucosinolate, per gram of air-dried, 
oil free solid. Before the removal of dockage, the seed shall contain 
not more than 10.0% of other grains for which standards have been 
established under the United States Grain Standards Act.


<R05>
Sec. 810.302  Definitions of other terms.

    (a) Conspicuous Admixture. All matter other than canola, including 
but not limited to ergot, sclerotinia, and stones, which is conspicuous 
and readily distinguishable from canola and which remains in the sample 
after the removal of machine separated dockage. Conspicuous admixture is 
added to machine separated dockage in the computation of total dockage.
    (b) Damaged kernels. Canola and pieces of canola that are heat-
damaged, sprout-damaged, mold-damaged, distinctly green damaged, frost 
damaged, rimed damaged, or otherwise materially damaged.
    (c) Distinctly green kernels. Canola and pieces of canola which, 
after being crushed, exhibit a distinctly green color.
    (d) Dockage. All matter other than canola that can be removed from 
the original sample by use of an approved device according to procedures 
prescribed in FGIS instructions. Also, underdeveloped, shriveled, and 
small pieces of canola kernels that cannot be recovered by properly 
rescreening or recleaning. Machine separated dockage is added to 
conspicuous admixture in the computation of total dockage.
    (e) Ergot. Sclerotia (sclerotium, sing.) of the fungus, Claviceps 
species, which are associated with some seeds other

[[Page 452]]

than canola where the fungal organism has replaced the seed.
    (f) Heat-damaged kernels. Canola and pieces of canola which, after 
being crushed, exhibit that they are discolored and damaged by heat.
    (g) Inconspicuous admixture. Any seed which is difficult to 
distinguish from canola. This includes, but is not limited to, common 
wild mustard (Brassica kaber and B. juncea), domestic brown mustard 
(Brassica juncea), yellow mustard (B. hirta), and seed other than the 
mustard group.
    (h) Sclerotia (Sclerotium, sing.). Dark colored or black resting 
bodies of the fungi Sclerotinia and Claviceps.
    (i) Sclerotinia. Genus name which includes the fungus Sclerotinia 
sclerotiorum which produces sclerotia. Canola is only infrequently 
infected, and the sclerotia, unlike sclerotia of ergot, are usually 
associated within the stem of the plants.

            Principles Governing the Application of Standards


<R05>
Sec. 810.303  Basis of determination.

    Each determination of conspicuous admixture, ergot, sclerotinia, 
stones, damaged kernels, heat-damaged kernels, distinctly green kernels,

procedures prescribed in FGIS instructions.
    (b) Broken kernels and foreign material. The combination of broken 
kernels and foreign material as defined in paragraph (a) and (f) of this 
section.
    (c) Classes. There are four classes of sorghum: Sorghum, Tannin 
sorghum, White sorghum, and Mixed sorghum.
    (1) Sorghum. Sorghum which is low in tannin content due to the 
absence of a pigmented testa (subcoat) and contains less than 98.0

the presence of a pigmented testa (subcoat) and contains not more than 
10.0 percent non-Tannin sorghum. The pericarp color of this class is 
usually brown but may also be white, yellow, pink, orange, red, or 
bronze.
    (3) White sorghum. Sorghum which is low in tannin content due to the 
absence of a pigmented testa (subcoat) and contains not more than 2.0 
percent sorghum of other classes. The pericarp color of this class is 
white or translucent and includes sorghum containing spots that, singly 
or in combination, cover 25.0 percent or less of the kernel.
    (4) Mixed sorghum. Sorghum which does not meet the requirements for 
any of the classes Sorghum, Tannin sorghum, or White sorghum.
    (d) Damaged kernels. Kernels, pieces of sorghum kernels and other 
grains that are badly ground damaged, badly weather damaged, diseased, 
frost-damaged, germ-damaged, heat-damaged, insect-bored, mold-damaged, 
sprout-damaged, or otherwise materially damaged.
    (e) Dockage. All matter other than sorghum that can be removed from 
the original sample by use of an approved device according to procedures 
prescribed in FGIS instructions. Also, underdeveloped, shriveled, and 
small pieces of sorghum kernels removed in properly separating the 
material other than sorghum.
    (f) Foreign material. All matter, except sorghum, which passes over 
the number 6 riddle and all matter other than sorghum that remains on 
top of the 5/64 triangular-hole sieve according to procedures prescribed 
in FGIS instructions.

    (g) Heat-damaged kernels. Kernels, pieces of sorghum kernels, and 
other grains that are materially discolored and damaged by heat.
    (h) Nongrain sorghum. Seeds of broomcorn, Johnson-grass, Sorghum 
almum Parodi, sorghum-sudangrass hybrids, sorgrass, sudangrass, and 
sweet sorghum (sorgo).
    (i) Pericarp. The pericarp is the outer layers of the sorghum grain 
and is fused to the seedcoat.
    (j) Sieves.
    (1) 1.98 mm (5/64 (0.0781) inches) triangular-hole sieve. A metal 
sieve 0.81 mm (0.032 inches) thick with equilateral triangular 
perforations the inscribed circles of which are 1.98 mm (0.0781 inches) 
in diameter.

            Principles Governing the Application of Standards


<R05>
Sec. 810.2203  Basis of determination.

    Each determination of heat-damaged kernels, damaged kernels, foreign 
material, wheat of other classes, contrasting classes, and subclasses is 
made on the basis of the grain when free from dockage and shrunken and 
broken kernels. Other determinations not specifically provided for under 
the general provisions are made on the basis of the grain when free from 
dockage, except the determination of odor is made on either the basis of 
the grain as a whole or the grain when free from dockage.

<R05>
Sec. 868.101  General information.

    The Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) 
of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) facilitates the fair and 
efficient marketing of agricultural products by maintaining voluntary 
grade standards for Beans, Whole Dry Peas, Split Peas, and Lentils, 
which provide a uniform language for describing the quality of these 
commodities in the marketplace. These standards may cover (but are not 
limited to) terms, classes, quality levels, performance criteria, and 
inspection requirements. Procedures contained in this part set forth the 
process which GIPSA will follow in developing, issuing, revising, 
suspending, or terminating the U.S. standards for Beans, Whole Dry Peas, 
Split Peas, and Lentils. Communications about GIPSA standards in general 
should be addressed to the Administrator, GIPSA, USDA, 1400 Independence 
Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20250-3601.


<R05>
Sec. 868.102  Procedures for establishing and revising grade standards.

    (a) GIPSA will develop, revise, suspend, or terminate grade 
standards if it determines that such action is in the public interest. 
GIPSA encourages interested parties to participate in the review, 
development, and revision of grade standards. Interested parties include 
growers, producers, processors, shippers, distributors, consumers, trade 
associations, companies, and State or Federal agencies. Such persons may 
at any time recommend that GIPSA develop, revise, suspend, or terminate 
a grade standard. Requests for action should be in writing, and should 
be accompanied by a draft of the suggested change, as appropriate.
    (b) GIPSA will:
    (1) Determine the need for new or revised standards;
    (2) Collect technical, marketing, or other appropriate data;
    (3) Conduct research regarding new or revised standards, as 
appropriate; and
    (4) Draft the proposed standards.
    (c) If GIPSA determines that new standards are needed, existing 
standards need to be revised, or the suspension or termination of 
existing standards is justified, GIPSA will undertake the action with 
input from interested parties.


<R05>
Sec. 868.103  Public notification of grade standards action.

    (a) After developing a standardization proposal, GIPSA will publish 
a notice in the Federal Register proposing new or revised standards or 
suspending or terminating existing standards. The notice will provide a 
sufficient comment period for interested parties to submit comments.
    (b) GIPSA will simultaneously issue a news release about these 
actions, notifying the affected industry and general public. GIPSA will 
also distribute copies of proposals to anyone requesting a copy or to 
anyone it believes may be interested, including other Federal, State, or 
local government agencies.
    (c) All comments received within the comment period will be made 
part of the public record maintained by GIPSA, will be available to the 
public for review, and will be considered by GIPSA before final action 
is taken on the proposal.
    (d) Based on the comments received, GIPSA's knowledge of standards, 
grading, marketing, and other technical

[[Page 490]]

factors, and any other relevant information, GIPSA will decide whether 
the proposed actions should be implemented.
    (e) If GIPSA concludes that the changes as proposed or with 
appropriate modifications should be adopted, GIPSA will publish the 
final changes in the Federal Register as a final notice. GIPSA will make 
the grade standards and related information available in printed form 
and electronic media.
    (f) If GIPSA determines that proposed changes are not warranted, or 
otherwise are not in the public interest, GIPSA will either publish in 
the Federal Register a notice withdrawing the proposal, or will revise 
the proposal and again seek public input.

one-half or more chalky.
    (c) Classes. The following four classes:
Long Grain Rough Rice
Medium Grain Rough Rice
Short Grain Rough Rice
Mixed Rough Rice

Classes shall be based on the percentage of whole kernels, large broken 
kernels, and types of rice.
    (1) ``Long grain rough rice'' shall consist of rough rice which 
contains more than 25 percent of whole kernels and which after milling

kernels, red rice and damaged kernels, chalky kernels, other types, 
color, and the special grade Parboiled rough rice shall be on the basis 
of the whole and large broken kernels of milled rice that are produced 
in the milling of rough rice to a well-milled degree. When determining 
class, the percentage of (a) whole kernels of rough rice shall be 
determined on the basis of the original sample, and (b) types of rice 
shall be determined on the basis of the whole and large broken kernels 
of milled rice that are produced in the milling of rough rice to a well-
milled degree. Smutty kernels shall be determined on the basis of the 
rough rice after it has been cleaned and shelled as prescribed in FGIS 
instructions, or by any method that is approved by the Administrator as 
giving equivalent results. All other determinations shall be on the 
basis of the original sample. Mechanical sizing of kernels shall be 
adjusted by handpicking as prescribed in FGIS instructions, or by any 
method that is approved by the Administrator as giving equivalent 
results.

     Special Grades, Special Grade Requirements, and Special Grade 
                              Designations


<R05>
Sec. 868.212  Special grades and requirements.

    A special grade, when applicable, is supplemental to the grade 
assigned under Sec. 868.210. Such special grades for rough rice are 
established and determined as follows:
    (a) Infested rough rice. Tolerances for live insects for infested 
rough rice are defined according to sampling designations as follows:
    (1) Representative sample. The representative sample consists of the 
work portion, and the file sample if needed and when available. The 
rough rice (except when examined according to paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section will be considered infested if the representative sample 
contains two or more live weevils, or one live weevil and one or more 
other live insects injurious to stored rice or five or more other live 
insects injurious to stored rice.
    (2) Lot as a whole (stationary). The lot as a whole is considered 
infested when two or more live weevils, or one live weevil and one or 
more other live insects injurious to stored rice, or five or more other 
live insects injurious to stored rice, or 15 or more live Angoumois 
moths or other live moths injurious to stored rice are found in, on, or 
about the lot.
    (3) Sample as a whole during continuous loading/unloading. The 
minimum sample size for rice being sampled during continuous loading/
unloading is 500 grams per each 100,000 pounds of rice. The sample as a 
whole is considered infested when a component (as defined in FGIS 
instructions) contains two or more live weevils, or one live weevil and 
one or more other live insects injurious to stored rice, or five or more 
other live insects injurious to stored rice.
    (b) Parboiled rough rice. Parboiled rough rice shall be rough rice 
in which the starch has been gelatinized by soaking, steaming, and 
drying. Grades U.S. No. 1 to U.S. No. 6 inclusive, shall contain not 
more than 10.0 percent of ungelatinized kernels. Grades U.S. No. 1 and 
U.S. No. 2 shall contain not more than 0.1 percent, grades U.S. No. 3 
and U.S. No. 4 not more than 0.2 percent, and grades U.S. No. 5 and U.S. 
No. 6 not more than 0.5 percent of nonparboiled rice. If the rice is: 
(1) Not distinctly colored by the parboiling process, it shall be 
considered ``Parboiled Light''; (2) distinctly but not materially 
colored by the parboiling process, it shall be considered ``Parboiled''; 
(3) materially colored by the parboiling process, it shall be considered 
``Parboiled Dark.'' The color levels for ``Parboiled Light,'' 
``Parboiled,'' and ``Parboiled Dark'' rice shall be in accordance with 
the interpretive line samples for parboiled rice.
    Note: The maximum limits for ``Chalky kernels,'' ``Heat-damaged 
kernels,'' ``Kernels damaged by heat,'' and the ``Color requirements'' 
shown in Sec. 868.210 are not applicable to the special grade 
``Parboiled rough rice.''
    (c) Smutty rough rice. Smutty rough rice shall be rough rice which 
contains more than 3.0 percent of smutty kernels.
    (d) Glutinous rough rice. Glutinous rough rice shall be special 
varieties of rice (Oryza sativa L. glutinosa) which contain more than 50 
percent chalky kernels. Grade U.S. No. 1 shall contain not more than 1.0 
percent of nonchalky kernels, grade U.S. No. 2 not more than 2.0 percent 
of nonchalky kernels, grade U.S. No. 3 not more than 4.0 percent of 
nonchalky kernels, grade U.S. No. 4 not more than 6.0 percent of 
nonchalky kernels, grade U.S. No. 5 not more than 10.0 percent of 
nonchalky kernels, and grade U.S. No. 6 not more than 15.0 percent of 
nonchalky kernels.
    Note: The maximum limits for ``Chalky kernels'' in Sec. 868.210 are 
not applicable to the special grade ``Glutinous rough rice.''
    (e) Aromatic rough rice. Aromatic rough rice shall be special 
varieties of rice (Oryza sativa L. scented) that have a distinctive and 
characteristic aroma; e.g., basmati and jasmine rice.

<R05>
Sec. 868.308  Percentages.

    (a) Rounding. Percentages are determined on the basis of weight and 
are rounded as follows:
    (1) When the figure to be rounded is followed by a figure greater 
than or equal to 5, round to the next higher figure; e.g., report 6.36 
as 6.4, 0.35 as 0.4, and 2.45 as 2.5.
    (2) When the figure to be rounded is followed by a figure less than 
5, retain the figure, e.g., report 8.34 as 8.3 and 1.22 and 1.2.
    (b) Recording. The percentage of broken kernels removed by a 5 plate 
in U.S. Nos. 1 and 2 Milled Rice and the percentage of objectionable 
seeds in U.S. No. 1 Brewers Milled Rice is reported to the nearest 
hundredth percent. The percentages of all other factors are recorded to 
the nearest tenth of a percent.

     Special Grades, Special Grade Requirements, and Special Grade 
                              Designations


<R05>
Sec. 868.315  Special grades and special grade requirements.

    A special grade, when applicable, is supplemental to the grade 
assigned under Sec. 868.314. Such special grades for milled rice are 
established and determined as follows:
    (a) Coated Milled Rice. Coated milled rice shall be rice which is 
coated, in whole or in part, with substances that are safe and suitable 
as defined in the regulation issued pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act at 21 CFR 130.3(d).
    (b) Granulated brewers milled rice. Granulated brewers milled rice 
shall be milled rice which has been crushed or granulated so that 95.0 
percent or more will pass through a 5 sieve, 70.0 percent or more will 
pass through a 4 sieve, and not more than 15.0 percent will pass through 
a 2\1/2\ sieve.
    (c) Parboiled milled rice. Parboiled milled rice shall be milled 
rice in which the starch has been gelatinized by soaking, steaming, and 
drying. Grades U.S. No. 1 to U.S. No. 6, inclusive, shall contain not 
more than 10.0 percent of ungelatinized kernels. Grades U.S. No. 1 and 
U.S. No. 2 shall contain not more than 0.1 percent, grades U.S. No. 3 
and U.S. No. 4 not more than 0.2 percent, and grades U.S. No. 5 and U.S. 
No. 6 not more than 0.5 percent of nonparboiled rice. If the rice is: 
(1) Not distinctly colored by the parboiling process, it shall be 
considered ``Parboiled Light''; (2) distinctly but not materially 
colored by the parboiling process, it shall be considered ``Parboiled''; 
(3) materially colored by the parboiling process, it shall be considered 
``Parboiled Dark.'' The color levels for ``Parboiled Light,'' 
``Parboiled,'' and ``Parboiled Dark'' shall be in accordance with the 
interpretive line samples for parboiled rice.
    Note: The maximum limits for ``Chalky kernels,'' ``Heat-damaged 
kernels,'' ``Kernels damaged by heat,'' and the ``Color requirements'' 
in Secs. 868.310, 868.311, 868.312, and 868.313 are not applicable to 
the special grade ``Parboiled milled rice.''
    (d) Undermilled milled rice. Undermilled milled rice shall be milled 
rice which is not equal to the milling requirements for ``hard milled,'' 
``well milled,'' and ``reasonably well milled'' rice (see Sec. 868.306). 
Grades U.S. No. 1 and U.S. No. 2 shall contain not more than 2.0 
percent, grades U.S. No. 3 and U.S. No. 4 not more than 5.0 percent, 
grade U.S. No. 5 not more than 10.0 percent, and grade U.S. No. 6 not 
more than 15.0 percent of well-milled kernels. Grade U.S. No. 5 shall 
contain not more than 10.0 percent of red rice and damaged kernels 
(singly or combined) and in no case more than 6.0 percent of damaged 
kernels.
    (e) Glutinous milled rice. Glutinous milled rice shall be special 
varieties of rice (Oryza sativa L. glutinosa) which contain more than 50 
percent chalky kernels. For long grain, medium grain,

[[Page 511]]

and short grain milled rice, grade U.S. No. 1 shall contain not more 
than 1.0 percent of nonchalky kernels, grade U.S. No. 2 not more than 
2.0 percent of nonchalky kernels, grade U.S. No. 3 not more than 4.0 
percent of nonchalky kernels, grade U.S. No. 4 not more than 6.0 percent 
of nonchalky kernels, grade U.S. No. 5 not more than 10.0 percent of 
nonchalky kernels, and grade U.S. No. 6 not more than 15.0 percent of 
nonchalky kernels. For second head milled rice, grade U.S. No. 1 shall 
contain not more than 4.0 percent of nonchalky kernels, grade U.S. No. 2 
not more than 6.0 percent of nonchalky kernels, grade U.S. No. 3 not 
more than 10.0 percent of nonchalky kernels, grade U.S. No. 4 not more 
than 15.0 percent of nonchalky kernels, and grade U.S. No. 5 not more 
than 20.0 percent of nonchalky kernels. For screenings milled rice, 
there are no grade limits for percent of nonchalky kernels. For brewers 
milled rice, the special grade ``Glutinous milled rice'' is not 
applicable.
    Note: The maximum limits for ``Chalky kernels,'' shown in 
Secs. 868.310, 868.311, and 868.312 are not applicable to the special 
grade ``Glutinous milled rice.''
    (f) Aromatic milled rice. Aromatic milled rice shall be special 
varieties of rice (Oryza sativa L. scented) that have a distinctive and 
characteristic aroma; e.g., basmati and jasmine rice.
