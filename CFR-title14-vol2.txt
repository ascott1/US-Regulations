              the Federal Register (44 U.S.C. 1510).

          It is prohibited to use NARA's official seal and the stylized Code 
              of Federal Regulations logo on any republication of this 
              material without the express, written permission of the 
              Archivist of the United States or the Archivist's designee. 
              Any person using NARA's official seals and logos in a manner

                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2005), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

FR 666, Jan. 7, 1998; 68 FR 43, Jan. 2, 2003]

Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 93--Temporary Extension of Time 
                To Allow for Certain Training and Testing

    1. Applicability. This SFAR applies to all part 121 and 135 check 
airmen (simulator) and flight instructors (simulator), part 121 aircraft 
dispatchers, and part 142 training center instructors who were required 
to complete qualification requirements, an inflight line observation 
program, or operating familiarization in September 2001 to become 
qualified, or remain qualified, to perform their assigned duties. It 
also applies to persons who have satisfactorily accomplished the part 61 
aeronautical knowledge test or the part 63 written test, either one of 
which has an expiration date of September 2001 for pilot, flight 
instructor, or flight engineer certification.
    2. Special Qualification Requirements. The sections of 14 CFR that 
prescribes these requirements are sections 61.39(a)(1); 63.35(d); 
121.411(f); 121.412(f); 121.463(a)(2); 121.463(c); 135.337(f); 
135.338(f); 142.53(b)(2) and (b)(3).
    3. Extension of Time to Fulfill Certain Qualification Requirements. 
Persons identified in paragraph 1 of this SFAR who had until the end of 
September 2001 to complete the specified qualification requirements in 
September 2001 will be deemed to have completed those requirements in 
September 2001 provided they satisfactorily complete those requirements 
by November 30, 2001. For those persons identified in paragraph 1, who 
are qualifying for the first time to be a check airmen (simulator), 
flight instructor (simulator), aircraft dispatcher, or training center 
instructor, they must fulfill the applicable qualification requirements 
before they may serve as a check airmen (simulator), flight instructor 
(simulator), aircraft dispatcher, or training center instructor, as 
appropriate. This extension does not change the 12-calendar-month 
requirement for aircraft dispatchers or the anniversary month for check 
airmen, flight instructors and training center instructors. Therefore, 
if you were due for qualification in September 2001 you will be due for 
qualification September 2002, regardless of this extension for 2001.
    4. Termination Date. This Special Federal Aviation Regulation 
expires November 30, 2001.

    (a) General. (1) The practical test for an airline transport pilot 
certificate is given for--
    (i) An airplane category and single-engine class rating;
    (ii) An airplane category and multiengine class rating;
    (iii) A rotorcraft category and helicopter class rating;
    (iv) A powered-lift category rating; and
    (v) An aircraft type rating for the category and class ratings 
listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iv) of this section.
    (2) A person who is applying for an airline transport pilot 
practical test must meet--
    (i) The eligibility requirements of Sec. 61.153 of this part; and
    (ii) The aeronautical knowledge and aeronautical experience 
requirements of this subpart that apply to the aircraft category and 
class rating sought.
    (b) Aircraft type rating. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of 
this section, a person who is applying for an aircraft type rating to be 
added to an airline transport pilot certificate:
    (1) Must receive and log ground and flight training from an 
authorized instructor on the areas of operation in this section that 
apply to the aircraft type rating sought;
    (2) Must receive a logbook endorsement from an authorized instructor 
certifying that the applicant completed the training on the areas of 
operation listed in paragraph (e) of this section that apply to the 
aircraft type rating sought; and
    (3) Must perform the practical test in actual or simulated 
instrument conditions, unless the aircraft's type certificate makes the 
aircraft incapable of operating under instrument flight rules. If the 
practical test cannot be accomplished for this reason, the person may 
obtain a type rating limited to ``VFR only.'' The ``VFR only'' 
limitation may be removed for that aircraft type when the person passes 
the practical test in actual or simulated instrument conditions.
    (c) Exceptions. A person who is applying for an aircraft type rating 
to be added to an airline transport pilot certificate or an aircraft 
type rating concurrently with an airline transport pilot certificate, 
and who is an employee of a certificate holder operating under part 121 
or 135 of this chapter or of a fractional ownership program manager 
operating under subpart K of part 91 of this chapter, need not comply 
with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section if the applicant 
presents a training record that shows satisfactory completion of that 
certificate holder's or program manager's approved pilot-in-command 
training program for the aircraft type rating sought.
    (d) Upgrading type ratings. Any type rating(s) on the pilot 
certificate of an applicant who successfully completes an airline 
transport pilot practical test shall be included on the airline 
transport pilot certificate with the privileges and limitations of the 
airline transport pilot certificate, provided the applicant passes the 
practical test in the same category and class of aircraft for which the 
applicant holds the type rating(s). However, if a type rating for that 
category and class of aircraft on the superseded pilot certificate is 
limited to VFR, that limitation shall be

[[Page 129]]

copies of the course outline, a description of his facilities and 
equipment, and a list of the instructors and their qualifications. 
Requirements for the course are set forth in appendix B to this part.

     Appendix A to Part 63--Test Requirements for Flight Navigator 
                               Certificate

    (a) Demonstration of skill. An applicant will be required to pass 
practical tests on the prescribed subjects. These tests may be given by 
FAA inspectors and designated flight navigator examiners.
    (b) The examination. The practical examination consists of a ground 
test and a flight test as itemized on the examination check sheet. Each 
item must be completed satisfactorily in order for the applicant to 
obtain a passing grade. Items 5, 6, 7 of the ground test may be 
completed orally, and items 17, 22, 23, 34, 36, 37, 38, and 39 of the 
flight test may be completed by an oral examination when a lack of 
ground facilities or navigation equipment makes such procedure 
necessary. In these cases a notation to that effect shall be made in the 
``Remarks'' space on the check sheet.
    (c) Examination procedure. (1) An applicant will provide an aircraft 
in which celestial observations can be taken in all directions. Minimum 
equipment shall include a table for plotting, a drift meter or absolute 
altimeter, an instrument for taking visual bearings, and a radio 
direction finder.
    (2) More than one flight may be used to complete the flight test and 
any type of flight pattern may be used. The test will be conducted 
chiefly over water whenever practicable, and without regard to radio 
range legs or radials. If the test is conducted chiefly over land, a 
chart should be used which shows very little or no topographical and 
aeronautical data. The total flight time will cover a period of at least 
four hours. Only one applicant may be examined at one time, and no 
applicant may perform other than navigator duties during the 
examination.
    (3) When the test is conducted with an aircraft belonging to an air 
carrier, the navigation procedures should conform with those set forth 
in the carrier's operations manual. Items of the flight test which are 
not performed during the routine navigation of the flight will be 
completed by oral examination after the flight or at times during flight 
which the applicant indicates may be used for tests on those items. 
Since in-flight weather conditions, the reliability of the weather 
forecast, and the stability of the aircraft will have considerable 
effect on an applicant's performance, good judgment must be used by the 
agent or examiner in evaluating the tests.
    (d) Ground test. For the ground test, in the order of the numbered 
items on the examination check sheet, an applicant will be required to:
    (1) Identify without a star identifier, at least six navigational 
stars and all planets available for navigation at the time of the 
examination and explain the method of identification.
    (2) Identify two additional stars with a star identifier or sky 
diagrams and explain identification procedure.
    (3) Precompute a time-altitude curve for a period of about 20 
minutes and take 10 single observations of a celestial body which is 
rising or setting rapidly. The intervals between observations should be 
at least one minute. Mark each observation on the graph to show 
accuracy. All observations, after corrections, shall plot within 8 
minutes of arc from the time-altitude curve, and the average error shall 
not exceed 5 minutes of arc.
    (4) Take and plot one 3-star fix and 3 LOP's of the sun. Plotted fix 
or an average of LOP's must fall within 5 miles of the actual position 
of the observer.
    (5) Demonstrate or explain the compensation and swinging of a 
liquid-type magnetic compass.
    (6) Demonstrate or explain a method of aligning one type of drift 
meter.
    (7) Demonstrate or explain a method of aligning an astro-compass or 
periscopic sextant.
    (e) Flight test. For the flight test, in the order of the numbered 
items on the examination check sheet, an applicant will be required to:
    (1) Demonstrate his ability to read weather symbols and interpret 
synoptic surface and upper air weather maps with particular emphasis 
being placed on winds.
    (2) Prepare a flight plan by zones from the forecast winds or 
pressure data of an upper air chart and the operator's data.
    (3) Compute from the operator's data the predicted fuel consumption 
for each zone of the flight, including the alternate.
    (4) Determine the point-of-no-return for the flight with all engines 
running and the equitime point with one engine inoperative. Graphical 
methods which are part of the company's operations manual may be used 
for these computations.
    (5) Prepare a cruise control (howgozit) chart from the operator's 
data.
    (6) Enter actual fuel consumed on the cruise control chart and 
interpret the variations of the actual curve from the predicted curve.
    (7) Check the presence on board and operating condition of all 
navigation equipment. Normally a check list will be used. This check 
will include a time tick or chronometer comparison. Any lack of 
thoroughness during this check will justify this item being graded 
unsatisfactory.

[[Page 130]]

    (8) Locate emergency equipment, such as, the nearest fire 
extinguisher, life preserver, life rafts, exits, axe, first aid kits, 
etc.
    (9) Recite the navigator's duties and stations during emergencies 
for the type of aircraft used for the test.
    (10) Demonstrate the proper use of a flux gate compass or gyrosyn 
compass (when available), with special emphasis on the caging methods 
and the location of switches, circuit breakers, and fuses. If these 
compasses are not part of the aircraft's equipment, an oral examination 
will be given.
    (11) Be accurate and use good judgment when setting and altering 
headings. Erroneous application of variation, deviation, or drift 
correction, or incorrect measurement of course on the chart will be 
graded as unsatisfactory.
    (12) Demonstrate or explain the use of characteristics of various 
chart projections used in long-range air navigation, including the 
plotting of courses and bearings, and the measuring of distances.
    (13) Demonstrate ability to identify designated landmarks by the use 
of a sectional or WAC chart.
    (14) Use a computer with facility and accuracy for the computation 
of winds, drift correction and drift angles, ground speeds, ETA's, fuel 
loads, etc.
    (15) Determine track, ground speed, and wind by the double drift 
method. When a drift meter is not part of the aircraft's equipment, an 
oral examination on the use of the drift meter and a double drift 
problem shall be completed.
    (16) Determine ground speed and wind by the timing method with a 
drift meter. When a drift meter is not part of the aircraft's equipment, 
an oral examination on the procedure and a problem shall be completed.
    (17) Demonstrate the use of air plot for determining wind between 
fixes and for plotting pressure lines of position when using pressure 
and absolute altimeter comparisons.
    (18) Give ETA's to well defined check points at least once each hour 
after the second hour of flight. The average error shall not be more 
than 5 percent of the intervening time intervals, and the maximum error 
of any one ETA shall not be more than 10 percent.
    (19) Demonstrate knowledge and use of D/F equipment and radio 
facility information. Grading on this item will be based largely on the 
applicant's selection of those radio aids which will be of most value to 
his navigation, the manner with which he uses equipment, including 
filter box controls, and the precision with which he reads bearings. The 
aircraft's compass heading and all compass corrections must be 
considered for each bearing.
    (20) Use care in tuning to radio stations to insure maximum 
reception of signal and check for interference signals. Receiver will be 
checked to ascertain that antenna and BFO (Voice-CW) switches are in 
correct positions.
    (21) Identify at least three radio stations using International 
Morse code only for identification. The agent or examiner will tune in 
these stations so that the applicant will have no knowledge of the 
direction, distance, or frequency of the stations.
    (22) Take at least one radio bearing by manual use of the loop. The 
agent or examiner will check the applicant's bearing by taking a manual 
bearing on the same station immediately after the applicant.
    (23) Show the use of good judgment in evaluating radio bearings, and 
explain why certain bearings may be of doubtful value.
    (24) Determine and apply correctly the correction required to be 
made to radio bearings before plotting them on a Mercator chart, and 
demonstrate the ability to plot bearings accurately on charts of the 
Mercator and Lambert conformal projections.
    (25) Compute the compass heading, ETA, and fuel remaining if it is 
assumed that the flight would be diverted to an alternate airport at a 
time specified by the agent or examiner.
    (26) Check the counter scales of a Loran receiver for accuracy, and 
explain the basic (face) adjustments which affect tuning and counter 
alignment. A guide sheet may be used for this test.
    (27) Demonstrate a knowledge of the basic principle of Loran and the 
ability to tune a Loran receiver, to match signals, to read time 
differences, to plot Loran LOP's, and to identify and use sky waves.
    (28) Take and plot bearings from a consol station and explain the 
precautions which must be taken when tuning a radio receiver for consol 
signals. Also, discuss those conditions which affect the reliability of 
consol bearings.
    (29) Demonstrate the ability to properly operate and read an 
absolute altimeter.
    (30) Determine the ``D'' factors for a series of compared readings 
of an absolute altimeter and a pressure altimeter.
    (31) Determine drift angle or lateral displacement from the true 
headingline by application of Bellamy's formula or a variation thereof.
    (32) Interpret the altimeter comparison data with respect to the 
pressure system found at flight level. From this data evaluate the 
accuracy of the prognostic weather map used for flight planning and 
apply this analysis to the navigation of the flight.
    (33) Interpret single LOP's for most probable position, and show how 
a series of single LOP's of the same body may be used to indicate the 
probable track and ground speed. Also, show how a series of single LOP's 
(celestial or radio) from the same celestial body or radio station may 
be used to determine

[[Page 131]]

position when the change of azimuth or bearing is 30[deg] or more 
between observations.
    (34) Select one of the celestial LOP's used during the flight and 
explain how to make a single line of position approach to a point 
selected by the agent or examiner, giving headings, times, and ETA's.
    (35) Demonstrate the proper use of an astro-compass or periscopic 
sextant for taking bearings.
    (36) Determine compass deviation as soon as possible after reaching 
cruising altitude and whenever there is a change of compass heading of 
15[deg] or more.
    (37) Take celestial fixes at hourly intervals when conditions 
permit. The accuracy of these fixes shall be checked by means of a 
Loran, radio, or visual fix whenever practicable. After allowing for the 
probable error of a Loran, radio, or visual fix, a celestial fix under 
favorable conditions should plot within 10 miles of the actual position.
    (38) Select celestial bodies for observation, when possible, whose 
azimuths will differ by approximately 120[deg] for a 3-body fix and will 
differ by approximately 90[deg] for a 2-body fix. The altitudes of the 
selected bodies should be between 25[deg] and 75[deg] whenever 
practicable.
    (39) Have POMAR and any other required reports ready for 
transmission at time of schedule, and be able to inform the pilot in 
command promptly with regard to the aircraft's position and progress in 
comparison with the flight plan.
    (40) Keep a log with sufficient legible entries to provide a record 
from which the flight could be retraced.
    (41) Note significant weather changes which might influence the 
drift or ground speed of the aircraft, such as, temperature, ``D'' 
factors, frontal conditions, turbulence, etc.
    (42) Determine the wind between fixes as a regular practice.
    (43) Estimate the time required and average ground speed during a 
letdown, under conditions specified by the pilot in command.
    (44) Work with sufficient speed to determine the aircraft's position 
hourly by celestial means and also make all other observations and 
records pertinent to the navigation. The applicant should be able to 
take the observation, compute, and plot a celestial LOP within a time 
limit of 8 minutes; take and plot a Loran LOP within a time limit of 3 
minutes for ground waves and 4 minutes for sky waves; observe the 
absolute and pressure altimeters and compute the drift or lateral 
displacement within a time limit of 3 minutes.
    (45) Be accurate in reading instruments and making computations. 
Errors which are made and corrected without affecting the navigation 
will be disregarded unless they cause considerable loss of time.
    An uncorrected error in computation (including reading instruments 
and books) which will affect the reported position more than 25 miles, 
the heading more than 3[deg], or any ETA more than 15 minutes will cause 
this item to be graded unsatisfactory.
    (46) Be alert to changing weather or other conditions during flight 
which might affect the navigation. An applicant should not fail to take 
celestial observations just prior to encountering a broken or overcast 
sky condition; and he should not fail to take a bearing on a radio 
station, which operates at scheduled intervals and which would be a 
valuable aid to the navigation.
    (47) Show a logical choice and sequence in using the various 
navigation methods according to time and accuracy, and check the 
positions determined by one method against positions determined by other 
methods.
    (48) Use a logical sequence in performing the various duties of a 
navigator and plan work according to a schedule. The more important 
duties should not be neglected for others of less importance.

    (3) Flight course outline. (i) A minimum of 150 hours of supervised 
flight training shall be given, of which at least 50 hours of flight 
training must be given at night, and celestial navigation must be used 
during flights which total at least 125 hours.
    (ii) A maximum of 50 hours of the required flight training may be 
obtained in acceptable types of synthetic flight navigator training 
devices.
    (iii) Flights should be at least four hours in length and should be 
conducted off civil airways. Some training on long-range flights is 
desirable, but is not required. There is no limit to the number of 
students that may be trained on one flight, but at least one astrodrome 
or one periscopic sextant mounting must be provided for each group of 
four students.
    (iv) Training must be given in dead reckoning, pilotage, radio 
navigation, celestial navigation, and the use of the absolute altimeter.
    (b) Equipment. (1) Classroom equipment shall include one table at 
least 24<gr-thn-eq> x 32<gr-thn-eq> in dimensions for each student.
    (2) Aircraft suitable for the flight training must be available to 
the approved course operator to insure that the flight training may be 
completed without undue delay.

The approved course operator may contract or obtain written agreements 
with aircraft operators for the use of suitable aircraft. A copy of the 
contract or written agreement with an aircraft operator shall be 
attached to each of the three copies of the course outline submitted for 
approval. In all cases, the approved course operator is responsible for 
the nature and quality of instruction given during flight.
    (c) Instructors. (1) Sufficient classroom instructors must be 
available to prevent an excessive ratio of students to instructors. Any

[[Page 133]]

ratio in excess of 20 to 1 will be considered unsatisfactory.
    (2) At least one ground instructor must hold a valid flight 
navigator certificate, and be utilized to coordinate instruction of 
ground school subjects.
    (3) Each instructor who conducts flight training must hold a valid 
flight navigator certificate.
    (d) Revision of training course. (1) Requests for revisions to 
course outlines, facilities, and equipment shall follow procedures for 
original approval of the course. Revisions should be submitted in such 
form that an entire page or pages of the approved outline can be removed 
and replaced by the revisions.
    (2) The list of instructors may be revised at any time without 
request for approval, provided the minimum requirement of paragraph (e) 
of this section is maintained.
    (e) Credit for previous training and experience. (1) Credit may be 
granted by an operator to students for previous training and experience 
which is provable and comparable to portions of the approved curriculum. 
When granting such credit, the approved course operator should be fully 
cognizant of the fact that he is responsible for the proficiency of his 
graduates in accordance with subdivision (i) of paragraph (3) of this 
section.
    (2) Where advanced credit is allowed, the operator shall evaluate 
the student's previous training and experience in accordance with the 
normal practices of accredited technical schools. Before credit is given 
for any ground school subject or portion thereof, the student must pass 
an appropriate examination given by the operator. The results of the 
examination, the basis for credit allowance, and the hours credited 
shall be incorporated as a part of the student's records.
    (3) Credit up to a maximum of 50 hours toward the flight training 
requirement may be given to pilots who have logged at least 500 hours 
while a member of a flight crew which required a certificated flight 
navigator or the Armed Forces equivalent. A similar credit may also be 
given to a licensed deck officer of the Maritime Service who has served 
as such for at least one year on ocean-going vessels. One-half of the 
flight time credited under the terms of this paragraph may be applied 
toward the 50 hours of flight training required at night.
    (f) Students records and reports. Approval of a course shall not be 
continued in effect unless the course operator keeps an accurate record 
of each student, including a chronological log of all instruction, 
subjects covered and course examinations and grades, and unless he 
prepares and transmits to the local Flight Standards District Office not 
later than January 31 of each year, a report containing the following 
information for the previous calendar year:
    (1) The names of all students graduated, together with their school 
grades for ground and flight subjects.
    (2) The names of all students failed or dropped, together with their 
school grades and reasons for dropping.
    (g) Quality of instruction. Approval of a course shall not be 
continued in effect unless at least 80 percent of the students who apply 
within 90 days after graduation are able to qualify on the first attempt 
for certification as flight navigators.
    (h) Statement of graduation. Each student who successfully completes 
an approved flight navigator course shall be given a statement of 
graduation.
    (i) Inspections. Approved course operations will be inspected by 
authorized representatives of the Administrator as often as deemed 
necessary to insure that instruction is maintained at the required 
standards, but the period between inspections shall not exceed 12 
months.
    (j) Change of ownership, name, or location--(1) Change of ownership. 
Approval of a flight navigator course shall not be continued in effect 
after the course has changed ownership. The new owner must obtain a new 
approval by following the procedure prescribed for original approval.
    (2) Change in name. An approved course changed in name but not 
changed in ownership shall remain valid if the change is reported by the 
approved course operator to the local Flight Standards District Office. 
A letter of approval under the new name will be issued by the regional 
office.
    (3) Change in location. An approved course shall remain in effect 
even though the approved course operator changes location if the change 
is reported without delay by the operator to the local Flight Standards 
District Office, which will inspect the facilities to be used. If they 
are found to be adequate, a letter of approval showing the new location 
will be issued by the regional office.
    (k) Cancellation of approval. (1) Failure to meet or maintain any of 
the requirements set forth in this section for the approval or operation 
of an approved flight navigator course shall be considered sufficient 
reason for cancellation of the approval.
    (2) If an operator should desire voluntary cancellation of his 
approved course, he should submit the effective letter of approval and a 
written request for cancellation to the Administrator through the local 
Flight Standards District Office.
    (l) Duration. The authority to operate an approved flight navigator 
course shall expire 24 months after the last day of the month of 
issuance.
    (m) Renewal. Application for renewal of authority to operate an 
approved flight navigator course may be made by letter to the local 
Flight Standards District Office at any time within 60 days before to 
the expiration

[[Page 134]]

date. Renewal of approval will depend upon the course operator meeting 
the current conditions for approval and having a satisfactory record as 
an operator.

   Appendix C to Part 63--Flight Engineer Training Course Requirements

    (a) Training course outline--(1) Format. The ground course outline 
and the flight course outline are independent. Each must be contained in 
a looseleaf binder to include a table of contents. If an applicant 
desires approval of both a ground school course and a flight school 
course, they must be combined in one looseleaf binder that includes a 
separate table of contents for each course. Separate course outlines are 
required for each type of airplane.
    (2) Ground course outline. (i) It is not mandatory that the subject 
headings be arranged exactly as listed in this paragraph. Any 
arrangement of subjects is satisfactory if all the subject material 
listed here is included and at least the minimum programmed hours are 
assigned to each subject. Each general subject must be broken down into 
detail showing the items to be covered.
    (ii) If any course operator desires to include additional subjects 
in the ground course curriculum, such as international law, flight 
hygiene, or others that are not required, the hours allotted these 
additional subjects may not be included in the minimum programmed

of the course. Revisions must be submitted in such form that an entire 
page or pages of the approved outline can be removed and replaced by the 
revisions.
    (2) The list of instructors may be revised at any time without 
request for approval, if the requirements of paragraph (d) of this 
appendix are maintained.
    (f) Ground school credits. (1) Credit may be granted a student in 
the ground school course by the course operator for comparable previous 
training or experience that the student can show by written evidence: 
however, the course operator must still meet the quality of instruction 
as described in paragraph (h) of this appendix.
    (2) Before credit for previous training or experience may be given, 
the student must pass a test given by the course operator on the subject 
for which the credit is to be given. The course operator shall 
incorporate

<R04>
                   Subpart E_Certification Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 67.401  Special issuance of medical certificates.

    (a) At the discretion of the Federal Air Surgeon, an Authorization 
for Special Issuance of a Medical Certificate (Authorization), valid for 
a specified period, may be granted to a person who does not meet the 
provisions of subparts B, C, or D of this part if the person shows to 
the satisfaction of the Federal Air Surgeon that the duties authorized 
by the class of medical certificate applied for can be performed without 
endangering public safety during the period in which the Authorization 
would be in force. The Federal Air Surgeon may authorize a special 
medical flight test, practical test, or medical evaluation for this 
purpose. A medical certificate of the appropriate class may be issued to 
a person who does not meet the provisions of subparts B, C, or D of this 
part if that person possesses a valid Authorization and is otherwise 
eligible. An airman medical certificate issued in accordance with this 
section shall expire no later than the end of the validity period or 
upon the withdrawal of the Authorization upon which it is based. At the 
end of its specified validity period, for grant of a new Authorization, 
the person must again show to the satisfaction of the Federal Air 
Surgeon that the duties authorized by the class of medical certificate 
applied for can be performed without endangering public safety during 
the period in which the Authorization would be in force.
    (b) At the discretion of the Federal Air Surgeon, a Statement of 
Demonstrated Ability (SODA) may be granted, instead of an Authorization, 
to a person whose disqualifying condition is static or nonprogressive 
and who has been found capable of performing airman duties without 
endangering public safety. A SODA does not expire and authorizes a 
designated aviation medical examiner to issue a medical certificate of a 
specified class if the examiner finds that the condition described on 
its face has not adversely changed.
    (c) In granting an Authorization or SODA, the Federal Air Surgeon 
may consider the person's operational experience and any medical facts 
that may affect the ability of the person to perform airman duties 
including--
    (1) The combined effect on the person of failure to meet more than 
one requirement of this part; and
    (2) The prognosis derived from professional consideration of all 
available information regarding the person.
    (d) In granting an Authorization or SODA under this section, the 
Federal Air Surgeon specifies the class of medical certificate 
authorized to be issued and may do any or all of the following:
    (1) Limit the duration of an Authorization;
    (2) Condition the granting of a new Authorization on the results of 
subsequent medical tests, examinations, or evaluations;
    (3) State on the Authorization or SODA, and any medical certificate 
based upon it, any operational limitation needed for safety; or
    (4) Condition the continued effect of an Authorization or SODA, and 
any second- or third-class medical certificate based upon it, on 
compliance with a statement of functional limitations issued to the 
person in coordination with the Director of Flight Standards or the 
Director's designee.
    (e) In determining whether an Authorization or SODA should be 
granted to an applicant for a third-class medical certificate, the 
Federal Air Surgeon considers the freedom of an airman, exercising the 
privileges of a private pilot certificate, to accept reasonable risks to 
his or her person and property that are not acceptable in the exercise 
of commercial or airline transport pilot privileges, and, at the same 
time, considers the need to protect the safety of persons and property 
in other aircraft and on the ground.
    (f) An Authorization or SODA granted under the provisions of this 
section

[[Page 169]]

to a person who does not meet the applicable provisions of subparts B, 
C, or D of this part may be withdrawn, at the discretion of the Federal 
Air Surgeon, at any time if--
    (1) There is adverse change in the holder's medical condition;
    (2) The holder fails to comply with a statement of functional 
limitations or operational limitations issued as a condition of 
certification under this section;
    (3) Public safety would be endangered by the holder's exercise of 
airman privileges;
    (4) The holder fails to provide medical information reasonably 
needed by the Federal Air Surgeon for certification under this section; 
or
    (5) The holder makes or causes to be made a statement or entry that 
is the basis for withdrawal of an Authorization or SODA under Sec. 
67.403.
    (g) A person who has been granted an Authorization or SODA under 
this section based on a special medical flight or practical test need 
not take the test again during later physical examinations unless the 
Federal Air Surgeon determines or has reason to believe that the 
physical deficiency has or may have degraded to a degree to require 
another special medical flight test or practical test.
    (h) The authority of the Federal Air Surgeon under this section is 
also exercised by the Manager, Aeromedical Certification Division, and 
each Regional Flight Surgeon.
    (i) If an Authorization or SODA is withdrawn under paragraph (f) of 
this section the following procedures apply:
    (1) The holder of the Authorization or SODA will be served a letter 
of withdrawal, stating the reason for the action;
    (2) By not later than 60 days after the service of the letter of 
withdrawal, the holder of the Authorization or SODA may request, in 
writing, that the Federal Air Surgeon provide for review of the decision 
to withdraw. The request for review may be accompanied by supporting 
medical evidence;
    (3) Within 60 days of receipt of a request for review, a written 
final decision either affirming or reversing the decision to withdraw 
will be issued; and
    (4) A medical certificate rendered invalid pursuant to a withdrawal, 
in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, shall be surrendered 
to the Administrator upon request.
    (j) No grant of a special issuance made prior to September 16, 1996, 
may be used to obtain a medical certificate after the earlier of the 
following dates:
    (1) September 16, 1997; or
    (2) The date on which the holder of such special issuance is 
required to provide additional information to the FAA as a condition for 
continued medical certification.

for a medical certificate or on a request for any Authorization for 
Special Issuance of a Medical Certificate (Authorization) or Statement 
of Demonstrated Ability (SODA) under this part;
    (2) A fraudulent or intentionally false entry in any logbook, 
record, or report that is kept, made, or used, to show compliance with 
any requirement for any medical certificate or for any Authorization or 
SODA under this part;
    (3) A reproduction, for fraudulent purposes, of any medical 
certificate under this part; or
    (4) An alteration of any medical certificate under this part.
    (b) The commission by any person of an act prohibited under 
paragraph (a) of this section is a basis for--
    (1) Suspending or revoking all airman, ground instructor, and 
medical certificates and ratings held by that person;
    (2) Withdrawing all Authorizations or SODA's held by that person; 
and
    (3) Denying all applications for medical certification and requests 
for Authorizations or SODA's.

medical certificate; withdrawing an Authorization or SODA; or denying an 
application for a medical certificate or request for an authorization or 
SODA:
    (1) An incorrect statement, upon which the FAA relied, made in 
support

[[Page 170]]

of an application for a medical certificate or request for an 
Authorization or SODA.
    (2) An incorrect entry, upon which the FAA relied, made in any 
logbook, record, or report that is kept, made, or used to show 
compliance with any requirement for a medical certificate or an 
Authorization or SODA.

person to release to the Administrator all available information or 
records concerning that history. If the applicant or holder fails to 
provide the requested medical information or history or to authorize the 
release so requested, the Administrator may suspend, modify, or revoke 
all medical certificates the airman holds or may, in the case of an 
applicant, deny the application for an airman medical certificate.
    (b) If an airman medical certificate is suspended or modified under

a copy to the Program Director for Air Traffic Airspace Management, 
Federal Aviation Administration, Washington, DC 20591.
    (b) In the report under this section the using agency shall:

[[Page 178]]

    (1) State the name and number of the restricted area as published in 
this part, and the period covered by the report.
    (2) State the activities (including average daily number of 
operations if appropriate) conducted in the area, and any other 
pertinent information concerning current and future electronic 
monitoring devices.
    (3) State the number of hours daily, the days of the week, and the 
number of weeks during the year that the area was used.
    (4) For restricted areas having a joint-use designation, also state 
the number of hours daily, the days of the week, and the number of weeks 
during the year that the restricted area was released to the controlling 
agency for public use.
    (5) State the mean sea level altitudes or flight levels (whichever 
is appropriate) used in aircraft operations and the maximum and average 
ordinate of surface firing (expressed in feet, mean sea level altitude) 
used on a daily, weekly, and yearly basis.
    (6) Include a chart of the area (of optional scale and design) 
depicting, if used, aircraft operating areas, flight patterns, ordnance 
delivery areas, surface firing points, and target, fan, and impact 
areas. After once submitting an appropriate chart, subsequent annual 
charts are not required unless there is a change in the area, activity 
or altitude (or flight levels) used, which might alter the depiction of 
the activities originally reported. If no change is to be submitted, a 
statement indicating ``no change'' shall be included in the report.
    (7) Include any other information not otherwise required under this 
part which is considered pertinent to activities carried on in the 
restricted area.
    (c) If it is determined that the information submitted under 
paragraph (b) of this section is not sufficient to evaluate the nature 
and extent of the use of a restricted area, the FAA may request the 
using agency to submit supplementary reports. Within 60 days after 
receiving a request for additional information, the using agency shall

Sec. 77.15  Construction or alteration not requiring notice.

    No person is required to notify the Administrator for any of the 
following construction or alteration:
    (a) Any object that would be shielded by existing structures of a 
permanent and substantial character or by natural terrain or topographic 
features of equal or greater height, and would be located in the 
congested area of a city, town, or settlement where it is evident beyond 
all reasonable doubt that the structure so shielded will not adversely 
affect safety in air navigation.
    (b) Any antenna structure of 20 feet or less in height except one 
that would increase the height of another antenna structure.
    (c) Any air navigation facility, airport visual approach or landing 
aid, aircraft arresting device, or meteorological device, of a type 
approved by the Administrator, or an appropriate military service on 
military airports, the location and height of which is fixed by its 
functional purpose.
    (d) Any construction or alteration for which notice is required by 
any other FAA regulation.

<R05>
Sec. 77.17  Form and time of notice.

    (a) Each person who is required to notify the Administrator under 
Sec. 77.13(a) shall send one executed form set (four copies) of FAA 
Form 7460-1, Notice of Proposed Construction or Alteration, to the 
Manager, Air Traffic Division, FAA Regional Office having jurisdiction 
over the area within which the construction or alteration will be 
located. Copies of FAA Form 7460-1 may be obtained from the headquarters 
of the Federal Aviation Administration and the regional offices.
    (b) The notice required under Sec. 77.13(a) (1) through (4) must be 
submitted at least 30 days before the earlier of the following dates:
    (1) The date the proposed construction or alteration is to begin.
    (2) The date an application for a construction permit is to be 
filed.

However, a notice relating to proposed construction or alteration that 
is subject to the licensing requirements of the Federal Communications 
Act may be sent to FAA at the same time the application for construction 
is filed with the Federal Communications Commission, or at any time 
before that filing.
    (c) A proposed structure or an alteration to an existing structure 
that exceeds 2,000 feet in height above the ground will be presumed to 
be a hazard to air navigation and to result in an inefficient 
utilization of airspace and the applicant has the burden of overcoming 
that presumption. Each notice submitted under the pertinent provisions 
of this part 77 proposing a structure in excess of 2,000 feet above 
ground, or an alteration that will make an existing structure exceed 
that height, must contain a detailed showing, directed to meeting this 
burden. Only in exceptional cases, where the FAA concludes that a clear 
and compelling showing has been made that it would not result in an 
inefficient utilization of the airspace and would not result in a hazard 
to air navigation, will a determination of no hazard be issued.
    (d) In the case of an emergency involving essential public services, 
public health, or public safety that requires immediate construction or 
alteration, the 30-day requirement in paragraph (b) of this section does 
not apply and the notice may be sent by telephone, telegraph, or other 
expeditious means,

[[Page 183]]

with an executed FAA Form 7460-1 submitted within 5 days thereafter. 
Outside normal business hours, emergency notices by telephone or 
telegraph may be submitted to the nearest FAA Flight Service Station.
    (e) Each person who is required to notify the Administrator by 
paragraph (b) or (c) of Sec. 77.13, or both, shall send an executed 
copy of FAA Form 117-1, Notice of Progress of Construction or 
Alteration, to the Manager, Air Traffic Division, FAA Regional Office 
having jurisdiction over the area involved.

Sec. 77.19  Acknowledgment of notice.

    (a) The FAA acknowledges in writing the receipt of each notice 
submitted under Sec. 77.13(a).
    (b) If the construction or alteration proposed in a notice is one 
for which lighting or marking standards are prescribed in the FAA 
Advisory Circular AC 70/7460-1, entitled ``Obstruction Marking and 
Lighting,'' the acknowledgment contains a statement to that effect and 
information on how the structure should be marked and lighted in 
accordance with the manual.
    (c) The acknowledgment states that an aeronautical study of the 
proposed construction or alteration has resulted in a determination that 
the construction or alteration:
    (1) Would not exceed any standard of subpart C and would not be a 
hazard to air navigation;
    (2) Would exceed a standard of subpart C but would not be a hazard 
to air navigation; or
    (3) Would exceed a standard of subpart C and further aeronautical 
study is necessary to determine whether it would be a hazard to air 
navigation, that the sponsor may request within 30 days that further 
study, and that, pending completion of any further study, it is presumed 
the construction or alteration would be a hazard to air navigation.

                     Subpart C_Obstruction Standards


<R05>
Sec. 77.21  Scope.

    (a) This subpart establishes standards for determining obstructions 
to air navigation. It applies to existing and proposed manmade objects, 
objects of natural growth, and terrain. The standards apply to the use 
of navigable airspace by aircraft and to existing air navigation 
facilities, such as an air navigation aid, airport, Federal airway, 
instrument approach or departure procedure, or approved off-airway 
route. Additionally, they apply to a planned facility or use, or a 
change in an existing facility or use, if a proposal therefor is on file 
with the Federal Aviation Administration or an appropriate military 
service on the date the notice required by Sec. 77.13(a) is filed.
    (b) At those airports having defined runways with specially prepared 
hard surfaces, the primary surface for each such runway extends 200 feet 
beyond each end of the runway. At those airports having defined strips 
or pathways that are used regularly for the taking off and landing of 
aircraft and have been designated by appropriate authority as runways, 
but do not have specially prepared hard surfaces, each end of the 
primary surface for each such runway shall coincide with the 
corresponding end of the runway. At those airports, excluding seaplane 
bases, having a defined landing and takeoff area with no defined 
pathways for the landing and taking off of aircraft, a determination 
shall be made as to which portions of the landing and takeoff area are 
regularly used as landing and takeoff pathways. Those pathways so 
determined shall be considered runways and an appropriate primary 
surface as defined in Sec. 77.25(c) will be considered as being 
longitudinally centered on each runway so determined, and each end of 
that primary surface shall coincide with the corresponding end of that 
runway.
    (c) The standards in this subpart apply to the effect of 
construction or alteration proposals upon an airport if, at the time of 
filing of the notice required by Sec. 77.13(a), that airport is--
    (1) Available for public use and is listed in the Airport Directory 
of the current Airman's Information Manual

[[Page 184]]

or in either the Alaska or Pacific Airman's Guide and Chart Supplement; 
or
    (2) A planned or proposed airport or an airport under construction, 
that is the subject of a notice or proposal on file with the Federal 
Aviation Administration, and, except for military airports, it is 
clearly indicated that that airport will be available for public use; 
or,
    (3) An airport that is operated by an armed force of the United 
States.

<R05>
Sec. 77.23  Standards for determining obstructions.

    (a) An existing object, including a mobile object, is, and a future 
object would be, an obstruction to air navigation if it is of greater 
height than any of the following heights or surfaces:
    (1) A height of 500 feet above ground level at the site of the 
object.
    (2) A height that is 200 feet above ground level or above the 
established airport elevation, whichever is higher, within 3 nautical 
miles of the established reference point of an airport, excluding 
heliports, with its longest runway more than 3,200 feet in actual 
length, and that height increases in the proportion of 100 feet for each 
additional nautical mile of distance from the airport up to a maximum of 
500 feet.
    (3) A height within a terminal obstacle clearance area, including an 
initial approach segment, a departure area, and a circling approach 
area, which would result in the vertical distance between any point on 
the object and an established minimum instrument flight altitude within 
that area or segment to be less than the required obstacle clearance.
    (4) A height within an en route obstacle clearance area, including 
turn and termination areas, of a Federal airway or approved off-airway 
route, that would increase the minimum obstacle clearance altitude.
    (5) The surface of a takeoff and landing area of an airport or any 
imaginary surface established under Sec. 77.25, Sec. 77.28, or Sec. 
77.29. However, no part of the take-off or landing area itself will be 
considered an obstruction.
    (b) Except for traverse ways on or near an airport with an operative 
ground traffic control service, furnished by an air traffic control 
tower or by the airport management and coordinated with the air traffic 
control service, the standards of paragraph (a) of this section apply to 
traverse ways used or to be used for the passage of mobile objects only 
after the heights of these traverse ways are increased by:
    (1) Seventeen feet for an Interstate Highway that is part of the 
National System of Military and Interstate Highways where overcrossings 
are designed for a minimum of 17 feet vertical distance.
    (2) Fifteen feet for any other public roadway.
    (3) Ten feet or the height of the highest mobile object that would 
normally traverse the road, whichever is greater, for a private road.
    (4) Twenty-three feet for a railroad, and,
    (5) For a waterway or any other traverse way not previously 
mentioned, an amount equal to the height of the highest mobile object 
that would normally traverse it.

<R05>
Sec. 77.25  Civil airport imaginary surfaces.

    The following civil airport imaginary surfaces are established with 
relation to the airport and to each runway. The size of each such 
imaginary surface is based on the category of each runway according to 
the type of approach available or planned for that runway. The slope and 
dimensions of the approach surface applied to each end of a runway are 
determined by the most precise approach existing or planned for that 
runway end.
    (a) Horizontal surface. A horizontal plane 150 feet above the 
established airport elevation, the perimeter of which is constructed by 
swinging arcs of specified radii from the center of each end of the 
primary surface of each runway of each airport and connecting the 
adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. The radius of each arc is:
    (1) 5,000 feet for all runways designated as utility or visual;
    (2) 10,000 feet for all other runways. The radius of the arc 
specified for each

[[Page 185]]

end of a runway will have the same arithmetical value. That value will 
be the highest determined for either end of the runway. When a 5,000-
foot arc is encompassed by tangents connecting two adjacent 10,000-foot 
arcs, the 5,000-foot arc shall be disregarded on the construction of the 
perimeter of the horizontal surface.
    (b) Conical surface. A surface extending outward and upward from the 
periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of 20 to 1 for a 
horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.
    (c) Primary surface. A surface longitudinally centered on a runway. 
When the runway has a specially prepared hard surface, the primary 
surface extends 200 feet beyond each end of that runway; but when the 
runway has no specially prepared hard surface, or planned hard surface, 
the primary surface ends at each end of that runway. The elevation of 
any point on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the 
nearest point on the runway centerline. The width of a primary surface 
is:
    (1) 250 feet for utility runways having only visual approaches.
    (2) 500 feet for utility runways having nonprecision instrument 
approaches.
    (3) For other than utility runways the width is:
    (i) 500 feet for visual runways having only visual approaches.
    (ii) 500 feet for nonprecision instrument runways having visibility 
minimums greater than three-fourths statute mile.
    (iii) 1,000 feet for a nonprecision instrument runway having a 
nonprecision instrument approach with visibility minimums as low as 
three-fourths of a statute mile, and for precision instrument runways.

The width of the primary surface of a runway will be that width 
prescribed in this section for the most precise approach existing or 
planned for either end of that runway.
    (d) Approach surface. A surface longitudinally centered on the 
extended runway centerline and extending outward and upward from each 
end of the primary surface. An approach surface is applied to each end 
of each runway based upon the type of approach available or planned for 
that runway end.
    (1) The inner edge of the approach surface is the same width as the 
primary surface and it expands uniformly to a width of:
    (i) 1,250 feet for that end of a utility runway with only visual 
approaches;
    (ii) 1,500 feet for that end of a runway other than a utility runway 
with only visual approaches;
    (iii) 2,000 feet for that end of a utility runway with a 
nonprecision instrument approach;
    (iv) 3,500 feet for that end of a nonprecision instrument runway 
other than utility, having visibility minimums greater than three-
fourths of a statute mile;
    (v) 4,000 feet for that end of a nonprecision instrument runway, 
other than utility, having a nonprecision instrument approach with 
visibility minimums as low as three-fourths statute mile; and
    (vi) 16,000 feet for precision instrument runways.
    (2) The approach surface extends for a horizontal distance of:
    (i) 5,000 feet at a slope of 20 to 1 for all utility and visual 
runways;
    (ii) 10,000 feet at a slope of 34 to 1 for all nonprecision 
instrument runways other than utility; and,
    (iii) 10,000 feet at a slope of 50 to 1 with an additional 40,000 
feet at a slope of 40 to 1 for all precision instrument runways.
    (3) The outer width of an approach surface to an end of a runway 
will be that width prescribed in this subsection for the most precise 
approach existing or planned for that runway end.
    (e) Transitional surface. These surfaces extend outward and upward 
at right angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline 
extended at a slope of 7 to 1 from the sides of the primary surface and 
from the sides of the approach surfaces. Transitional surfaces for those 
portions of the precision approach surface which project through and 
beyond the limits of the conical surface, extend a distance of 5,000 
feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach surface and at 
right angles to the runway centerline.

<R05>
Sec. 77.28  Military airport imaginary surfaces.

    (a) Related to airport reference points. These surfaces apply to all 
military airports. For the purposes of this section a military airport 
is any airport operated by an armed force of the United States.
    (1) Inner horizontal surface. A plane is oval in shape at a height 
of 150 feet above the established airfield elevation. The plane is 
constructed by scribing an arc with a radius of 7,500 feet about the 
centerline at the end of each runway and interconnecting these arcs with 
tangents.
    (2) Conical surface. A surface extending from the periphery of the 
inner horizontal surface outward and upward at a slope of 20 to 1 for a 
horizontal distance of 7,000 feet to a height of 500 feet above the 
established airfield elevation.
    (3) Outer horizontal surface. A plane, located 500 feet above the 
established airfield elevation, extending outward from the outer 
periphery of the conical surface for a horizontal distance of 30,000 
feet.
    (b) Related to runways. These surfaces apply to all military 
airports.
    (1) Primary surface. A surface located on the ground or water 
longitudinally centered on each runway with the same length as the 
runway. The width of the primary surface for runways is 2,000 feet. 
However, at established bases where substantial construction has taken 
place in accordance with a previous lateral clearance criteria, the 
2,000-foot width may be reduced to the former criteria.
    (2) Clear zone surface. A surface located on the ground or water at 
each end of the primary surface, with a length of 1,000 feet and the 
same width as the primary surface.
    (3) Approach clearance surface. An inclined plane, symmetrical about 
the runway centerline extended, beginning 200 feet beyond each end of 
the primary surface at the centerline elevation of the runway end and 
extending for 50,000 feet. The slope of the approach clearance surface 
is 50 to 1 along the runway centerline extended until it reaches an 
elevation of 500 feet above the established airport elevation. It then 
continues horizontally at this elevation to a point 50,000 feet from the 
point of beginning. The width of this surface at the runway end is the 
same as the primary surface, it flares uniformly, and the width at 
50,000 is 16,000 feet.
    (4) Transitional surfaces. These surfaces connect the primary 
surfaces, the first 200 feet of the clear zone surfaces, and the 
approach clearance surfaces to the inner horizontal surface, conical 
surface, outer horizontal surface or other transitional surfaces. The 
slope of the transitional surface is 7 to 1 outward and upward at right 
angles to the runway centerline.

Sec. 77.29  Airport imaginary surfaces for heli ports.

    (a) Heliport primary surface. The area of the primary surface 
coincides in size and shape with the designated take-off and landing 
area of a heliport. This surface is a horizontal plane at the elevation 
of the established heliport elevation.
    (b) Heliport approach surface. The approach surface begins at each 
end of the heliport primary surface with the same width as the primary 
surface, and extends outward and upward for a horizontal distance of 
4,000 feet where its width is 500 feet. The slope of the approach 
surface is 8 to 1 for civil heliports and 10 to 1 for military 
heliports.
    (c) Heliport transitional surfaces These surfaces extend outward and 
upward from the lateral boundaries of the heliport primary surface and 
from the approach surfaces at a slope of 2 to 1 for a distance of 250 
feet measured horizontally from the centerline of the primary and 
approach surfaces.

    (c) The FAA official who issued the determination reviews each 
petition presented under paragraph (b) of this section, and revises, 
extends, or affirms the determination as indicated by his findings.
    (d) In any case in which a final determination made under this 
subpart or subpart B or E of this part relates to proposed construction 
or alteration that may not be started unless the Federal Communications 
Commission issues an appropriate construction permit, the effective 
period of each final determination includes--
    (1) The time required to apply to the Commission for a construction 
permit, but not more than 6 months after the effective date of the 
determination; and
    (2) The time necessary for the Commission to process the application 
except in a case where the Administrator determines a shorter effective 
period is required by the circumstances.
    (e) If the Commission issues a construction permit, the final 
determination is effective until the date prescribed for completion of 
the construction. If the Commission refuses to issue a construction 
permit, the final determination expires on the date of its refusal.

        Subpart E_Rules of Practice for Hearings Under Subpart D


<R05>
Sec. 77.41  Scope.

    This subpart applies to hearings held by the FAA under titles I, 
III, and X of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49 U.S.C. subchapters I, 
III, and X), on proposed construction or alteration that affects the use 
of navigable airspace.


<R05>
Sec. 77.43  Nature of hearing.

    Sections 4, 5, 7, and 8 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 
U.S.C. 1003, 1004, 1006, and 1007) do not apply to hearings held on 
proposed construction or alteration to determine its effect on the 
safety of aircraft and the efficient use of navigable airspace because 
those hearings are factfinding in nature. As a factfinding procedure, 
each hearing is nonadversary and there are no formal pleadings or 
adverse parties.

[[Page 189]]


<R05>
Sec. 77.45  Presiding officer.

    (a) If, under Sec. 79.37, the Administrator grants a public hearing 
on any proposed construction or alteration covered by this part, the 
Director, Air Traffic Operations Service designates an FAA employee to 
be the presiding officer at the hearing.
    (b) The presiding officer may:
    (1) Give notice of the date and location of the hearing and any 
prehearing conference that may be held;
    (2) Administer oaths and affirmations;
    (3) Examine witnesses;
    (4) Issue subpoenas and take depositions or have them taken;
    (5) Obtain, in the form of a public record, all pertinent and 
relevant facts relating to the subject matter of the hearing;
    (6) Rule, with the assistance of the legal officer, upon the 
admissibility of evidence;
    (7) Regulate the course and conduct of the hearing; and
    (8) Designate parties to the hearing and revoke those designations.

FR 39292, Sept. 25, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 77.47  Legal officer.

    The Chief Counsel designates a member of his staff to serve as legal 
officer at each hearing under this subpart. The legal officer may 
examine witnesses and assist and advise the presiding officer on 
questions of evidence or other legal questions arising during the 
hearing.

[Doc. No. 1882, 30 FR 1839, Feb. 10, 1965, as amended at 38 FR 26444, 
Sept. 17, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 77.49  Notice of hearing.

    In designating a time and place for a hearing under this subpart the 
presiding officer considers the needs of the FAA and the convenience of 
the parties and witnesses. The time and place of each hearing is 
published in the ``Notices'' section of the Federal Register before the 
date of the hearing, unless the notice is impractical or unnecessary.


<R05>
Sec. 77.51  Parties to the hearing.

    The presiding officer designates the following as parties to the 
hearing--
    (a) The proponent of the proposed construction or alteration.
    (b) Those persons whose activities would be substantially affected 
by the proposed construction or alteration.


<R05>
Sec. 77.53  Prehearing conference.

    (a) The presiding officer may, in his discretion, hold a prehearing 
conference with the parties to the hearing and the legal officer before 
the hearing.
    (b) At the direction of the presiding officer, each party to a 
prehearing conference shall submit a brief written statement of the 
evidence he intends to provide through his witnesses and by questioning 
other witnesses at the hearing, and shall provide enough copies of the 
statement so that the presiding officer may keep three for the FAA and 
give one to each other party.
    (c) At the prehearing conference, the presiding officer reduces and 
simplifies the subject matter of the hearing so far as possible and 
advises the parties of the probable order of presenting the evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 77.55  Examination of witnesses.

    (a) Each witness at a hearing under this subpart shall, after being 
sworn by the presiding officer, give his testimony under oath.
    (b) The party for whom a witness, other than an employee of the FAA, 
is testifying shall examine that witness. After that examination, other 
parties to the hearing may examine the witness, in the order fixed by 
the presiding officer. The presiding officer and the legal officer may 
then examine the witness. The presiding officer may grant any party an 
additional opportunity to examine any witness, if that party adequately 
justifies the additional examination.
    (c) The legal officer examines each FAA employee who is a witness, 
before the other parties examine him. After that examination, the order 
prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section applies. An FAA employee may 
testify only as to facts within his personal knowledge and the 
application of FAA regulations, standards, and policies.

[[Page 190]]


<R05>
Sec. 77.57  Evidence.

    (a) The presiding officer receives all testimony and exhibits that 
are relevant to the issues of the hearing. So far as possible, each 
party shall submit enough copies of his exhibits that the presiding 
officer may keep three copies for the FAA and give one to each other 
party.
    (b) The presiding officer excludes any testimony that is irrelevant, 
unduly repetitious, or consists of statements made during an 
aeronautical study in an effort to reconcile or compromise aviation or 
construction or alteration requirements. A party to the hearing may 
object to the admission of evidence only on the ground that it is 
irrelevant.


<R05>
Sec. 77.59  Subpoenas of witnesses and exhibits.

    (a) The presiding officer of a hearing may issue subpoenas for any 
witness or exhibit that he determines may be material and relevant to 
the issues of the hearing. So far as possible, each party to the hearing 
shall provide the witnesses and exhibits that he intends to present at 
the hearing.
    (b) If any party to the hearing is unable to provide his necessary 
witnesses and exhibits, he shall advise the presiding officer far enough 
in advance that the presiding officer can determine whether he should 
issue subpoenas for the desired witnesses or exhibits.


<R05>
Sec. 77.61  Revision of construction or alteration proposal.

    (a) The sponsor of any proposed construction or alteration covered 
by this part may revise his proposal at any time before or during the 
hearing. If he revises it, the presiding officer decides whether the 
revision affects the proposal to the extent that he should send it to 
the Administrator for a redetermination of the need for a hearing.
    (b) If the presiding officer decides that it does not need to be 
resubmitted to the Administrator, he advises the parties of the revised 
proposal and takes the action necessary to allow all parties to 
effectively participate in the hearing on the revised proposal. Without 
limiting his discretion, the presiding officer may recess and reconvene 
the hearing, or hold another prehearing conference.


<R05>
Sec. 77.63  Record of hearing.

    (a) Each hearing is recorded verbatim by an official reporter under 
an FAA contract. The transcript, and all exhibits, become a part of the 
record of the hearing.
    (b) Any person may buy a copy of the transcript of the hearing from 
the reporter at the price fixed for it.
    (c) The presiding officer may allow any party to withdraw an 
original document if he submits authenticated copies of it.
    (d) Any person may buy, from the FAA, photostatic copies of any 
exhibit by paying the copying costs.
    (e) A change in the official transcript of a hearing may be made 
only if it involves an error of substance. Any recommendation to correct 
the transcript must be filed with the presiding officer within 5 days 
after the hearing closes. The presiding officer reviews each request for 
a correction to the extent he considers appropriate and shall make any 
revisions that he finds appropriate as a result of that review.


<R05>
Sec. 77.65  Recommendations by parties.

    Within 20 days after the mailing of the record of hearing by the 
official reporter, or as otherwise directed by the presiding officer, 
each party may submit to the presiding officer five copies of his 
recommendations for a final decision to be made by the Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 77.67  Final decision of the Administrator.

    After reviewing the evidence relevant to the questions of fact in a 
hearing, including the official transcript and the exhibits, The 
Administrator resolves all these questions, based on the weight of 
evidence, and makes his determination, stating the basis and reasons for 
it. He then issues an appropriate order to be served on each of the 
parties.


<R05>
Sec. 77.69  Limitations on appearance and representation.

    (a) A former officer or employee of the FAA may not appear on behalf 
of, or represent, any party before the FAA

[[Page 191]]

in connection with any matter to which this part applies, if he 
considered or passed on that matter while he was an officer or employee 
of the FAA.
    (b) A person appearing before the FAA on any matter to which this 
part applies may not, in connection with that appearance, knowingly 
accept assistance from, or share fees with, any person who is prohibited 
by paragraph (a) of this section, from appearing himself on that matter.
    (c) A former official or employee of the FAA may not, within 6 
months after he ceases to be such an officer or employee, appear before 
the FAA on behalf of, or represent, any party in connection with any 
proceeding that was pending under this part while he was an officer or 
employee of the FAA, unless he obtains written consent from an 
appropriate officer of the FAA, based on a verified showing that he did 
not personally consider the matter concerned or gain particular 
knowledge of it while he was an officer or employee of the FAA.


<R04>
              Subpart F_Establishment of Antenna Farm Areas


<R05>
Sec. 77.71  Scope.

    (a) This subpart establishes antenna farm areas in which antenna 
structures may be grouped to localize their effect on the use of 
navigable airspace.
    (b) It is the policy of the FAA to encourage the use of antenna 
farms and the single structure-multiple antenna concept for radio and 
television towers whenever possible. In considering proposals for 
establishing antenna farm areas, it considers as far as possible the 
revision of aeronautical procedures and operations to accommodate 
antenna structures that will fulfill broadcasting requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 77.73  General provisions.

    (a) An antenna farm area consists of a specified geographical 
location with established dimensions of area and height, where antenna 
towers with a common impact on aviation may be grouped. Each such area 
is established by appropriate rule making action.
    (b) Each proposal for an antenna farm area is evaluated on the basis 
of its effect on the use of navigable airspace. The views of the Federal 
Communications Commission are requested on the effect that each 
establishment of an antenna farm area would have on its statutory 
responsibilities. Any views submitted by it are fully considered before 
the antenna farm concerned is established. If the Commission advises 
that the establishment of any proposed antenna farm area would interfere 
with its statutory responsibility, the proposed area is not established.
    (c) The establishment of an antenna farm area is considered whenever 
it is proposed by:
    (1) The FAA;
    (2) The Federal Communications Commission;
    (3) The sponsor of a proposed antenna tower; or
    (4) Any other person having a substantial interest in a proposed 
antenna tower.

[Doc. No. 1882, 30 FR 1839, Feb. 10, 1965, as amended by Amdt. 77-10, 37 
FR 4705, Mar. 4, 1972]


<R05>
Sec. 77.75  Establishment of antenna farm areas.

    The airspace areas described in the following sections of this 
subpart are established as antenna farm areas.

    Note: Sections 77.77 through 77.1100 reserved for descriptions of 
antenna farm areas.

passenger seating configuration of more than 30 seats or a payload 
capacity of more than 7,500 pounds.
    (b) Flights conducted in gliders or hot air balloons.
    Section 2. Definitions. For the purposes of this SFAR:
    ``Air tour'' means any sightseeing flight conducted under visual 
flight rules in an airplane or helicopter for compensation or hire.
    ``Air tour operator'' means any person who conducts an air tour.
    Section 3. Helicopter flotation equipment. No person may conduct an 
air tour in Hawaii in a single-engine helicopter beyond the shore of any 
island, regardless of whether the helicopter is within gliding distance 
of the shore, unless:
    (a) The helicopter is amphibious or is equipped with floats adequate 
to accomplish a safe emergency ditching and approved flotation gear is 
easily accessible for each occupant; or
    (b) Each person on board the helicopter is wearing approved 
flotation gear.
    Section 4. Helicopter performance plan. Each operator must complete 
a performance plan before each helicopter air tour flight. The 
performance plan must be based on the information in the Rotorcraft 
Flight Manual (RFM), considering the maximum density altitude for which 
the operation is planned for the flight to determine the following:
    (a) Maximum gross weight and center of gravity (CG) limitations for 
hovering in ground effect;
    (b) Maximum gross weight and CG limitations for hovering out of 
ground effect; and,
    (c) Maximum combination of weight, altitude, and temperature for 
which height-velocity information in the RFM. is valid.
    The pilot in command (PIC) must comply with the performance plan.
    Section 5. Helicopter operating limitations. Except for approach to 
and transition from a hover, the PIC shall operate the helicopter at a 
combination of height and forward speed (including hover) that would 
permit a safe landing in event of engine power loss, in accordance with 
the height-speed envelope for that helicopter under current weight and 
aircraft altitude.
    Section 6. Minimum flight altitudes. Except when necessary for 
takeoff and landing, or operating in compliance with an air traffic 
control clearance, or as otherwise authorized by the Administrator, no 
person may conduct an air tour in Hawaii:

    (a) Inapplicability. This section does not apply to the operation of 
an aircraft on water.
    (b) General. When weather conditions permit, regardless of whether 
an operation is conducted under instrument flight rules or visual flight 
rules, vigilance shall be maintained by each person operating an 
aircraft so as to see and avoid other aircraft. When a rule of this 
section gives another aircraft the right-of-way, the pilot shall give 
way to that aircraft and may not pass over, under, or ahead of it unless 
well clear.
    (c) In distress. An aircraft in distress has the right-of-way over 
all other air traffic.
    (d) Converging. When aircraft of the same category are converging at 
approximately the same altitude (except head-on, or nearly so), the 
aircraft to the other's right has the right-of-way.

[[Page 210]]

If the aircraft are of different categories--
    (1) A balloon has the right-of-way over any other category of 
aircraft;
    (2) A glider has the right-of-way over an airship, powered 
parachute, weight-shift-control aircraft, airplane, or rotorcraft.
    (3) An airship has the right-of-way over a powered parachute, 
weight-shift-control aircraft, airplane, or rotorcraft.
    However, an aircraft towing or refueling other aircraft has the 
right-of-way over all other engine-driven aircraft.
    (e) Approaching head-on. When aircraft are approaching each other 
head-on, or nearly so, each pilot of each aircraft shall alter course to 
the right.
    (f) Overtaking. Each aircraft that is being overtaken has the right-
of-way and each pilot of an overtaking aircraft shall alter course to 
the right to pass well clear.
    (g) Landing. Aircraft, while on final approach to land or while 
landing, have the right-of-way over other aircraft in flight or 
operating on the surface, except that they shall not take advantage of 
this rule to force an aircraft off the runway surface which has already 
landed and is attempting to make way for an aircraft on final approach. 
When two or more aircraft are approaching an airport for the purpose of 
landing, the aircraft at the lower altitude has the right-of-way, but it 
shall not take advantage of this rule to cut in front of another which 
is on final approach to land or to overtake that aircraft.

insofar as possible, keep clear of all vessels and avoid impeding their 
navigation, and shall give way to any vessel or other aircraft that is 
given the right-of-way by any rule of this section.
    (b) Crossing. When aircraft, or an aircraft and a vessel, are on 
crossing courses, the aircraft or vessel to the other's right has the 
right-of-way.
    (c) Approaching head-on. When aircraft, or an aircraft and a vessel, 
are approaching head-on, or nearly so, each shall alter its course to 
the right to keep well clear.
    (d) Overtaking. Each aircraft or vessel that is being overtaken has 
the right-of-way, and the one overtaking shall alter course to keep well 
clear.
    (e) Special circumstances. When aircraft, or an aircraft and a 
vessel, approach so as to involve risk of collision, each aircraft or 
vessel shall proceed with careful regard to existing circumstances, 
including the limitations of the respective craft.


<R05>
Sec. 91.117  Aircraft speed.

    (a) Unless otherwise authorized by the Administrator, no person may 
operate an aircraft below 10,000 feet MSL at an indicated airspeed of

Sec. 91.123  Compliance with ATC clearances and instructions.

    (a) When an ATC clearance has been obtained, no pilot in command may 
deviate from that clearance unless an amended clearance is obtained, an 
emergency exists, or the deviation is in response to a traffic alert and 
collision avoidance system resolution advisory. However, except in Class 
A airspace, a pilot may cancel an IFR flight plan if the operation is 
being conducted in VFR weather conditions. When a pilot is uncertain of 
an ATC clearance, that pilot shall immediately request clarification 
from ATC.
    (b) Except in an emergency, no person may operate an aircraft 
contrary to an ATC instruction in an area in which air traffic control 
is exercised.
    (c) Each pilot in command who, in an emergency, or in response to a 
traffic alert and collision avoidance system resolution advisory, 
deviates from an ATC clearance or instruction shall notify ATC of that 
deviation as soon as possible.
    (d) Each pilot in command who (though not deviating from a rule of 
this subpart) is given priority by ATC

[[Page 212]]

in an emergency, shall submit a detailed report of that emergency within 
48 hours to the manager of that ATC facility, if requested by ATC.
    (e) Unless otherwise authorized by ATC, no person operating an 
aircraft may operate that aircraft according to any clearance or 
instruction that has been issued to the pilot of another aircraft for

Sec. 91.126  Operating on or in the vicinity of an airport in Class G 
airspace.

    (a) General. Unless otherwise authorized or required, each person 
operating an aircraft on or in the vicinity of an airport in a Class G 
airspace area must comply with the requirements of this section.
    (b) Direction of turns. When approaching to land at an airport 
without an operating control tower in Class G airspace--
    (1) Each pilot of an airplane must make all turns of that airplane 
to the left unless the airport displays approved light signals or visual 
markings indicating that turns should be made to the right, in which 
case the pilot must make all turns to the right; and
    (2) Each pilot of a helicopter or a powered parachute must avoid the 
flow of fixed-wing aircraft.
    (c) Flap settings. Except when necessary for training or 
certification, the pilot in command of a civil turbojet-powered aircraft 
must use, as a final flap setting, the minimum certificated landing flap 
setting set forth in the approved performance information in the 
Airplane Flight Manual for the applicable conditions. However, each 
pilot in command has the final authority and responsibility for the safe 
operation of the pilot's airplane, and may use a different flap setting 
for that airplane if the pilot determines that it is necessary in the 
interest of safety.
    (d) Communications with control towers. Unless otherwise authorized 
or required by ATC, no person may operate an aircraft to, from, through, 
or on an airport having an operational control tower unless two-way 
radio communications are maintained between that aircraft and the 
control tower. Communications must be established prior to 4 nautical 
miles from the airport, up to and including 2,500 feet AGL. However, if 
the aircraft radio fails in flight, the pilot in command may operate 
that aircraft and land if weather conditions are at or above basic VFR 
weather minimums, visual contact with the tower is maintained, and a 
clearance to land is received. If the aircraft radio fails while in 
flight under IFR, the pilot must comply with Sec. 91.185.

Sec. 91.127  Operating on or in the vicinity of an airport in Class E 
airspace.

    (a) Unless otherwise required by part 93 of this chapter or unless 
otherwise authorized or required by the ATC facility having jurisdiction 
over the Class E airspace area, each person operating an aircraft on or 
in the vicinity of an airport in a Class E airspace area must comply 
with the requirements of Sec. 91.126.
    (b) Departures. Each pilot of an aircraft must comply with any 
traffic patterns established for that airport in part 93 of this 
chapter.
    (c) Communications with control towers. Unless otherwise authorized 
or required by ATC, no person may operate an aircraft to, from, through, 
or on an

[[Page 213]]

airport having an operational control tower unless two-way radio 
communications are maintained between that aircraft and the control 
tower. Communications must be established prior to 4 nautical miles from 
the airport, up to and including 2,500 feet AGL. However, if the 
aircraft radio fails in flight, the pilot in command may operate that 
aircraft and land if weather conditions are at or above basic VFR 
weather minimums, visual contact with the tower is maintained, and a 
clearance to land is received. If the aircraft radio fails while in 
flight under IFR, the pilot must comply with Sec. 91.185.

<R05>
Sec. 91.129  Operations in Class D airspace.

    (a) General. Unless otherwise authorized or required by the ATC 
facility having jurisdiction over the Class D airspace area, each person 
operating an aircraft in Class D airspace must comply with the 
applicable provisions of this section. In addition, each person must 
comply with Sec. Sec. 91.126 and 91.127. For the purpose of this 
section, the primary airport is the airport for which the Class D 
airspace area is designated. A satellite airport is any other airport 
within the Class D airspace area.
    (b) Deviations. An operator may deviate from any provision of this 
section under the provisions of an ATC authorization issued by the ATC 
facility having jurisdiction over the airspace concerned. ATC may 
authorize a deviation on a continuing basis or for an individual flight, 
as appropriate.
    (c) Communications. Each person operating an aircraft in Class D 
airspace must meet the following two-way radio communications 
requirements:
    (1) Arrival or through flight. Each person must establish two-way 
radio communications with the ATC facility (including foreign ATC in the 
case of foreign airspace designated in the United States) providing air 
traffic services prior to entering that airspace and thereafter maintain 
those communications while within that airspace.
    (2) Departing flight. Each person--
    (i) From the primary airport or satellite airport with an operating 
control tower must establish and maintain two-way radio communications 
with the control tower, and thereafter as instructed by ATC while 
operating in the Class D airspace area; or
    (ii) From a satellite airport without an operating control tower, 
must establish and maintain two-way radio communications with the ATC 
facility having jurisdiction over the Class D airspace area as soon as 
practicable after departing.
    (d) Communications failure. Each person who operates an aircraft in 
a Class D airspace area must maintain two-way radio communications with 
the ATC facility having jurisdiction over that area.
    (1) If the aircraft radio fails in flight under IFR, the pilot must 
comply with Sec. 91.185 of the part.
    (2) If the aircraft radio fails in flight under VFR, the pilot in 
command may operate that aircraft and land if--
    (i) Weather conditions are at or above basic VFR weather minimums;
    (ii) Visual contact with the tower is maintained; and
    (iii) A clearance to land is received.
    (e) Minimum Altitudes. When operating to an airport in Class D 
airspace, each pilot of--
    (1) A large or turbine-powered airplane shall, unless otherwise 
required by the applicable distance from cloud criteria, enter the 
traffic pattern at an altitude of at least 1,500 feet above the 
elevation of the airport and maintain at least 1,500 feet until further 
descent is required for a safe landing;
    (2) A large or turbine-powered airplane approaching to land on a 
runway served by an instrument landing system (ILS), if the airplane is 
ILS equipped, shall fly that airplane at an altitude at or above the 
glide slope between the outer marker (or point of interception of glide 
slope, if compliance with the applicable distance from cloud criteria 
requires interception closer in) and the middle marker; and
    (3) An airplane approaching to land on a runway served by a visual 
approach slope indicator shall maintain an altitude at or above the 
glide slope until a lower altitude is necessary for a safe landing.

Paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section do not prohibit normal 
bracketing

[[Page 214]]

maneuvers above or below the glide slope that are conducted for the 
purpose of remaining on the glide slope.
    (f) Approaches. Except when conducting a circling approach under 
part 97 of this chapter or unless otherwise required by ATC, each pilot 
must--
    (1) Circle the airport to the left, if operating an airplane; or
    (2) Avoid the flow of fixed-wing aircraft, if operating a 
helicopter.
    (g) Departures. No person may operate an aircraft departing from an 
airport except in compliance with the following:
    (1) Each pilot must comply with any departure procedures established 
for that airport by the FAA.
    (2) Unless otherwise required by the prescribed departure procedure 
for that airport or the applicable distance from clouds criteria, each 
pilot of a turbine-powered airplane and each pilot of a large airplane 
must climb to an altitude of 1,500 feet above the surface as rapidly as 
practicable.
    (h) Noise abatement. Where a formal runway use program has been 
established by the FAA, each pilot of a large or turbine-powered 
airplane assigned a noise abatement runway by ATC must use that runway. 
However, consistent with the final authority of the pilot in command 
concerning the safe operation of the aircraft as prescribed in Sec. 
91.3(a), ATC may assign a different runway if requested by the pilot in 
the interest of safety.
    (i) Takeoff, landing, taxi clearance. No person may, at any airport 
with an operating control tower, operate an aircraft on a runway or 
taxiway, or take off or land an aircraft, unless an appropriate 
clearance is received from ATC. A clearance to ``taxi to'' the takeoff 
runway assigned to the aircraft is not a clearance to cross that 
assigned takeoff runway, or to taxi on that runway at any point, but is 
a clearance to cross other runways that intersect the taxi route to that 
assigned takeoff runway. A clearance to ``taxi to'' any point other than 
an assigned takeoff runway is clearance to cross all runways that 
intersect the taxi route to that point.

Sec. 91.139  Emergency air traffic rules.

    (a) This section prescribes a process for utilizing Notices to 
Airmen (NOTAMs) to advise of the issuance and operations under emergency 
air traffic rules and regulations and designates the official who is 
authorized to issue NOTAMs on behalf of the Administrator in certain 
matters under this section.
    (b) Whenever the Administrator determines that an emergency 
condition exists, or will exist, relating to the FAA's ability to 
operate the air traffic control system and during which normal flight 
operations under this chapter cannot be conducted consistent with the 
required levels of safety and efficiency--
    (1) The Administrator issues an immediately effective air traffic 
rule or regulation in response to that emergency condition; and

[[Page 218]]

    (2) The Administrator or the Associate Administrator for Air Traffic 
may utilize the NOTAM system to provide notification of the issuance of 
the rule or regulation.


Those NOTAMs communicate information concerning the rules and 
regulations that govern flight operations, the use of navigation 
facilities, and designation of that airspace in which the rules and 
regulations apply.
    (c) When a NOTAM has been issued under this section, no person may 
operate an aircraft, or other device governed by the regulation 
concerned, within the designated airspace except in accordance with the 
authorizations, terms, and conditions prescribed in the regulation 
covered by the NOTAM.


<R05>
Sec. 91.141  Flight restrictions in the proximity of the Presidential 
and other parties.

    No person may operate an aircraft over or in the vicinity of any 
area to be visited or traveled by the President, the Vice President, or 
other public figures contrary to the restrictions established by the 
Administrator and published in a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM).


<R05>
Sec. 91.143  Flight limitation in the proximity of space flight 
operations.

    When a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) is issued in accordance with this 
section, no person may operate any aircraft of U.S. registry, or pilot 
any aircraft under the authority of an airman certificate issued by the 
Federal Aviation Administration, within areas designated in a NOTAM for 
space flight operation except when authorized by ATC.

Sec. 91.144  Temporary restriction on flight operations during abnormally 
high barometric pressure conditions.

    (a) Special flight restrictions. When any information indicates that 
barometric pressure on the route of flight currently exceeds or will 
exceed 31 inches of mercury, no person may operate an aircraft or 
initiate a flight contrary to the requirements established by the 
Administrator and published in a Notice to Airmen issued under this 
section.
    (b) Waivers. The Administrator is authorized to waive any 
restriction issued under paragraph (a) of this section to permit 
emergency supply, transport, or medical services to be delivered to 
isolated communities, where the operation can be conducted with an 
acceptable level of safety.

<R05>
Sec. 91.145  Management of aircraft operations in the vicinity of 
aerial demonstrations and major sporting events.

    (a) The FAA will issue a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) designating an 
area of airspace in which a temporary flight restriction applies when it 
determines that a temporary flight restriction is necessary to protect 
persons or property on the surface or in the air, to maintain air safety 
and efficiency, or to prevent the unsafe congestion of aircraft in the 
vicinity of an aerial demonstration or major sporting event. These 
demonstrations and events may include:
    (1) United States Naval Flight Demonstration Team (Blue Angels);
    (2) United States Air Force Air Demonstration Squadron 
(Thunderbirds);
    (3) United States Army Parachute Team (Golden Knights);
    (4) Summer/Winter Olympic Games;
    (5) Annual Tournament of Roses Football Game;
    (6) World Cup Soccer;
    (7) Major League Baseball All-Star Game;
    (8) World Series;
    (9) Kodak Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta;
    (10) Sandia Classic Hang Gliding Competition;
    (11) Indianapolis 500 Mile Race;
    (12) Any other aerial demonstration or sporting event the FAA 
determines to need a temporary flight restriction in accordance with 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) In deciding whether a temporary flight restriction is necessary 
for an aerial demonstration or major sporting event not listed in 
paragraph (a) of this section, the FAA considers the following factors:

[[Page 219]]

    (1) Area where the event will be held.
    (2) Effect flight restrictions will have on known aircraft 
operations.
    (3) Any existing ATC airspace traffic management restrictions.
    (4) Estimated duration of the event.
    (5) Degree of public interest.
    (6) Number of spectators.
    (7) Provisions for spectator safety.
    (8) Number and types of participating aircraft.
    (9) Use of mixed high and low performance aircraft.
    (10) Impact on non-participating aircraft.
    (11) Weather minimums.
    (12) Emergency procedures that will be in effect.
    (c) A NOTAM issued under this section will state the name of the 
aerial demonstration or sporting event and specify the effective dates 
and times, the geographic features or coordinates, and any other 
restrictions or procedures governing flight operations in the designated 
airspace.
    (d) When a NOTAM has been issued in accordance with this section, no 
person may operate an aircraft or device, or engage in any activity 
within the designated airspace area, except in accordance with the 
authorizations, terms, and conditions of the temporary flight 
restriction published in the NOTAM, unless otherwise authorized by:
    (1) Air traffic control; or
    (2) A Flight Standards Certificate of Waiver or Authorization issued 
for the demonstration or event.
    (e) For the purpose of this section:
    (1) Flight restricted airspace area for an aerial demonstration--The 
amount of airspace needed to protect persons and property on the surface 
or in the air, to maintain air safety and efficiency, or to prevent the 
unsafe congestion of aircraft will vary depending on the aerial 
demonstration and the factors listed in paragraph (b) of this section. 
The restricted airspace area will normally be limited to a 5 nautical 
mile radius from the center of the demonstration and an altitude 17000 
mean sea level (for high performance aircraft) or 13000 feet above the 
surface (for certain parachute operations), but will be no greater than 
the minimum airspace necessary for the management of aircraft operations 
in the vicinity of the specified area.
    (2) Flight restricted area for a major sporting event--The amount of 
airspace needed to protect persons and property on the surface or in the 
air, to maintain air safety and efficiency, or to prevent the unsafe 
congestion of aircraft will vary depending on the size of the event and 
the factors listed in paragraph (b) of this section. The restricted 
airspace will normally be limited to a 3 nautical mile radius from the 
center of the event and 2500 feet above the surface but will not be 
greater than the minimum airspace necessary for the management of 
aircraft operations in the vicinity of the specified area.
    (f) A NOTAM issued under this section will be issued at least 30 
days in advance of an aerial demonstration or a major sporting event, 
unless the FAA finds good cause for a shorter period and explains this 
in the NOTAM.
    (g) When warranted, the FAA Administrator may exclude the following 
flights from the provisions of this section:
    (1) Essential military.
    (2) Medical and rescue.
    (3) Presidential and Vice Presidential.
    (4) Visiting heads of state.
    (5) Law enforcement and security.
    (6) Public health and welfare.

of intended landing; and
    (2) Appropriate weather reports or weather forecasts, or a 
combination of them, indicate the following:
    (i) For aircraft other than helicopters. For at least 1 hour before 
and for 1 hour after the estimated time of arrival, the ceiling will be 
at least 2,000 feet above the airport elevation and the visibility will 
be at least 3 statute miles.
    (ii) For helicopters. At the estimated time of arrival and for 1 
hour after the estimated time of arrival, the ceiling will be at least 
1,000 feet above the airport elevation, or at least 400 feet above the 
lowest applicable approach minima, whichever is higher, and the 
visibility will be at least 2 statute miles.
    (c) IFR alternate airport weather minima. Unless otherwise 
authorized by the Administrator, no person may include an alternate 
airport in an IFR flight plan unless appropriate weather reports or 
weather forecasts, or a combination of them, indicate that, at the 
estimated time of arrival at the alternate airport, the ceiling and 
visibility at that airport will be at or above the following weather 
minima:
    (1) If an instrument approach procedure has been published in part 
97 of this chapter, or a special instrument approach procedure has been 
issued by the Administrator to the operator, for that airport, the 
following minima:
    (i) For aircraft other than helicopters: The alternate airport 
minima specified in that procedure, or if none are specified the 
following standard approach minima:
    (A) For a precision approach procedure. Ceiling 600 feet and 
visibility 2 statute miles.
    (B) For a nonprecision approach procedure. Ceiling 800 feet and 
visibility 2 statute miles.

[[Page 223]]

    (ii) For helicopters: Ceiling 200 feet above the minimum for the 
approach to be flown, and visibility at least 1 statute mile but never 
less than the minimum visibility for the approach to be flown, and
    (2) If no instrument approach procedure has been published in part 
97 of this chapter and no special instrument approach procedure has been 
issued by the Administrator to the operator, for the alternate airport, 
the ceiling and visibility minima are those allowing descent from the 
MEA, approach, and landing under basic VFR.
    (d) Cancellation. When a flight plan has been activated, the pilot 
in command, upon canceling or completing the flight under the flight 
plan, shall notify an FAA Flight Service Station or ATC facility.

Sec. 91.171  VOR equipment check for IFR operations.

    (a) No person may operate a civil aircraft under IFR using the VOR 
system of radio navigation unless the VOR equipment of that aircraft--
    (1) Is maintained, checked, and inspected under an approved 
procedure; or
    (2) Has been operationally checked within the preceding 30 days, and 
was found to be within the limits of the permissible indicated bearing 
error set forth in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, each person 
conducting a VOR check under paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall--
    (1) Use, at the airport of intended departure, an FAA-operated or 
approved test signal or a test signal radiated by a certificated and 
appropriately rated radio repair station or, outside the United States, 
a test signal operated or approved by an appropriate authority to check 
the VOR equipment (the maximum permissible indicated bearing error is 
plus or minus 4 degrees); or
    (2) Use, at the airport of intended departure, a point on the 
airport surface designated as a VOR system checkpoint by the 
Administrator, or, outside the United States, by an appropriate 
authority (the maximum permissible bearing error is plus or minus 4 
degrees);
    (3) If neither a test signal nor a designated checkpoint on the 
surface is available, use an airborne checkpoint designated by the 
Administrator or, outside the United States, by an appropriate authority 
(the maximum permissible bearing error is plus or minus 6 degrees); or
    (4) If no check signal or point is available, while in flight--
    (i) Select a VOR radial that lies along the centerline of an 
established VOR airway;
    (ii) Select a prominent ground point along the selected radial 
preferably more than 20 nautical miles from the VOR ground facility and 
maneuver the aircraft directly over the point at a reasonably low 
altitude; and
    (iii) Note the VOR bearing indicated by the receiver when over the 
ground point (the maximum permissible variation between the published 
radial and the indicated bearing is 6 degrees).
    (c) If dual system VOR (units independent of each other except for 
the antenna) is installed in the aircraft, the person checking the 
equipment may check one system against the other in place of the check 
procedures specified in paragraph (b) of this section. Both systems 
shall be tuned to the same VOR ground facility and note the indicated 
bearings to that station. The maximum permissible variation between the 
two indicated bearings is 4 degrees.
    (d) Each person making the VOR operational check, as specified in 
paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, shall enter the date, place, 
bearing error, and sign the aircraft log or other record. In addition, 
if a test signal radiated by a repair station, as specified in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, is used, an entry must be made in the aircraft 
log or other record by the repair station certificate holder or the 
certificate holder's representative certifying to the bearing 
transmitted by the repair station for the check and the date of 
transmission.

Sec. 91.173  ATC clearance and flight plan required.

    No person may operate an aircraft in controlled airspace under IFR 
unless that person has--
    (a) Filed an IFR flight plan; and
    (b) Received an appropriate ATC clearance.


<R05>
Sec. 91.175  Takeoff and landing under IFR.

    (a) Instrument approaches to civil airports. Unless otherwise 
authorized by the Administrator, when an instrument letdown to a civil 
airport is necessary, each person operating an aircraft, except a 
military aircraft of the United States, shall use a standard instrument 
approach procedure prescribed for the airport in part 97 of this 
chapter.
    (b) Authorized DH or MDA. For the purpose of this section, when the 
approach procedure being used provides for and requires the use of a DH 
or MDA, the authorized DH or MDA is the highest of the following:
    (1) The DH or MDA prescribed by the approach procedure.
    (2) The DH or MDA prescribed for the pilot in command.
    (3) The DH or MDA for which the aircraft is equipped.
    (c) Operation below DH or MDA. Except as provided in paragraph (l) 
of this section, where a DH or MDA is applicable, no pilot may operate 
an aircraft, except a military aircraft of the United States, at any 
airport below the authorized MDA or continue an approach below the 
authorized DH unless--
    (1) The aircraft is continuously in a position from which a descent 
to a landing on the intended runway can be made at a normal rate of 
descent using normal maneuvers, and for operations conducted under part 
121 or part 135 unless that descent rate will allow touchdown to occur 
within the touchdown zone of the runway of intended landing;
    (2) The flight visibility is not less than the visibility prescribed 
in the standard instrument approach being used; and
    (3) Except for a Category II or Category III approach where any 
necessary visual reference requirements are specified by the 
Administrator, at least one of the following visual references for the 
intended runway is distinctly visible and identifiable to the pilot:
    (i) The approach light system, except that the pilot may not descend 
below 100 feet above the touchdown zone elevation using the approach 
lights as a reference unless the red terminating bars or the red side 
row bars are also distinctly visible and identifiable.
    (ii) The threshold.
    (iii) The threshold markings.
    (iv) The threshold lights.
    (v) The runway end identifier lights.
    (vi) The visual approach slope indicator.
    (vii) The touchdown zone or touchdown zone markings.
    (viii) The touchdown zone lights.
    (ix) The runway or runway markings.
    (x) The runway lights.
    (d) Landing. No pilot operating an aircraft, except a military 
aircraft of the United States, may land that aircraft when--
    (1) For operations conducted under paragraph (l) of this section, 
the requirements of (l)(4) of this section are not met; or
    (2) For all other part 91 operations and parts 121, 125, 129, and 
135 operations, the flight visibility is less than the visibility 
prescribed in the standard instrument approach procedure being used.
    (e) Missed approach procedures. Each pilot operating an aircraft, 
except a military aircraft of the United States, shall immediately 
execute an appropriate missed approach procedure when either of the 
following conditions exist:
    (1) Whenever operating an aircraft pursuant to paragraph (c) or (l) 
of this section and the requirements of that paragraph are not met at 
either of the following times:
    (i) When the aircraft is being operated below MDA; or
    (ii) Upon arrival at the missed approach point, including a DH where 
a DH is specified and its use is required, and at any time after that 
until touchdown.
    (2) Whenever an identifiable part of the airport is not distinctly 
visible to the pilot during a circling maneuver at or above MDA, unless 
the inability to see an identifiable part of the airport results only 
from a normal bank of the aircraft during the circling approach.

[[Page 225]]

    (f) Civil airport takeoff minimums. Unless otherwise authorized by 
the Administrator, no pilot operating an aircraft under parts 121, 125, 
129, or 135 of this chapter may take off from a civil airport under IFR 
unless weather conditions are at or above the weather minimum for IFR 
takeoff prescribed for that airport under part 97 of this chapter. If 
takeoff minimums are not prescribed under part 97 of this chapter for a 
particular airport, the following minimums apply to takeoffs under IFR 
for aircraft operating under those parts:
    (1) For aircraft, other than helicopters, having two engines or 
less--1 statute mile visibility.
    (2) For aircraft having more than two engines--\1/2\ statute mile 
visibility.
    (3) For helicopters--\1/2\ statute mile visibility.
    (g) Military airports. Unless otherwise prescribed by the 
Administrator, each person operating a civil aircraft under IFR into or 
out of a military airport shall comply with the instrument approach 
procedures and the takeoff and landing minimum prescribed by the 
military authority having jurisdiction of that airport.
    (h) Comparable values of RVR and ground visibility. (1) Except for 
Category II or Category III minimums, if RVR minimums for takeoff or 
landing are prescribed in an instrument approach procedure, but RVR is 
not reported for the runway of intended operation, the RVR minimum shall 
be converted to ground visibility in accordance with the table in 
paragraph (h)(2) of this section and shall be the visibility minimum for 
takeoff or landing on that runway.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) Operations on unpublished routes and use of radar in instrument 
approach procedures. When radar is approved at certain locations for ATC 
purposes, it may be used not only for surveillance and precision radar 
approaches, as applicable, but also may be used in conjunction with 
instrument approach procedures predicated on other types of radio 
navigational aids. Radar vectors may be authorized to provide course 
guidance through the segments of an approach to the final course or fix. 
When operating on an unpublished route or while being radar vectored, 
the pilot, when an approach clearance is received, shall, in addition to 
complying with Sec. 91.177, maintain the last altitude assigned to that 
pilot until the aircraft is established on a segment of a published 
route or instrument approach procedure unless a different altitude is 
assigned by ATC. After the aircraft is so established, published 
altitudes apply to descent within each succeeding route or approach 
segment unless a different altitude is assigned by ATC. Upon reaching 
the final approach course or fix, the pilot may either complete the 
instrument approach in accordance with a procedure approved for the 
facility or continue a surveillance or precision radar approach to a 
landing.
    (j) Limitation on procedure turns. In the case of a radar vector to 
a final approach course or fix, a timed approach from a holding fix, or 
an approach for which the procedure specifies ``No PT,'' no pilot may 
make a procedure turn unless cleared to do so by ATC.
    (k) ILS components. The basic ground components of an ILS are the 
localizer, glide slope, outer marker, middle marker, and, when installed 
for use with Category II or Category III instrument approach procedures, 
an inner marker. A compass locator or precision radar may be substituted 
for the outer or middle marker. DME, VOR, or nondirectional beacon fixes 
authorized in the standard instrument approach procedure or surveillance 
radar may be substituted for the outer marker. Applicability of, and 
substitution for, the inner marker for Category II or III approaches is 
determined by the appropriate part 97 approach procedure, letter of 
authorization, or operations specification pertinent to the operations.

[[Page 226]]

    (l) Approach to straight-in landing operations below DH, or MDA 
using an enhanced flight vision system (EFVS). For straight-in 
instrument approach procedures other than Category II or Category III, 
no pilot operating under this section or Sec. Sec. 121.651, 125.381, 
and 135.225 of this chapter may operate an aircraft at any airport below 
the authorized MDA or continue an approach below the authorized DH and 
land unless--
    (1) The aircraft is continuously in a position from which a descent 
to a landing on the intended runway can be made at a normal rate of 
descent using normal maneuvers, and, for operations conducted under part 
121 or part 135 of this chapter, the descent rate will allow touchdown 
to occur within the touchdown zone of the runway of intended landing;
    (2) The pilot determines that the enhanced flight visibility 
observed by use of a certified enhanced flight vision system is not less 
than the visibility prescribed in the standard instrument approach 
procedure being used;
    (3) The following visual references for the intended runway are 
distinctly visible and identifiable to the pilot using the enhanced 
flight vision system:
    (i) The approach light system (if installed); or
    (ii) The following visual references in both paragraphs 
(l)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section:
    (A) The runway threshold, identified by at least one of the 
following:
    (1) The beginning of the runway landing surface;
    (2) The threshold lights; or
    (3) The runway end identifier lights.
    (B) The touchdown zone, identified by at least one of the following:
    (1) The runway touchdown zone landing surface;
    (2) The touchdown zone lights;
    (3) The touchdown zone markings; or
    (4) The runway lights.
    (4) At 100 feet above the touchdown zone elevation of the runway of 
intended landing and below that altitude, the flight visibility must be 
sufficient for the following to be distinctly visible and identifiable 
to the pilot without reliance on the enhanced flight vision system to 
continue to a landing:
    (i) The lights or markings of the threshold; or
    (ii) The lights or markings of the touchdown zone;
    (5) The pilot(s) is qualified to use an EFVS as follows--
    (i) For parts 119 and 125 certificate holders, the applicable 
training, testing and qualification provisions of parts 121, 125, and 
135 of this chapter;
    (ii) For foreign persons, in accordance with the requirements of the 
civil aviation authority of the State of the operator; or
    (iii) For persons conducting any other operation, in accordance with 
the applicable currency and proficiency requirements of part 61 of this 
chapter;
    (6) For parts 119 and 125 certificate holders, and part 129 
operations specifications holders, their operations specifications 
authorize use of EFVS; and
    (7) The aircraft is equipped with, and the pilot uses, an enhanced 
flight vision system, the display of which is suitable for maneuvering 
the aircraft and has either an FAA type design approval or, for a 
foreign-registered aircraft, the EFVS complies with all of the EFVS 
requirements of this chapter.
    (m) For purposes of this section, ``enhanced flight vision system'' 
(EFVS) is an installed airborne system comprised of the following 
features and characteristics:
    (1) An electronic means to provide a display of the forward external 
scene topography (the natural or manmade features of a place or region 
especially in a way to show their relative positions and elevation) 
through the use of imaging sensors, such as a forward-looking infrared, 
millimeter wave radiometry, millimeter wave radar, and low-light level 
image intensifying;
    (2) The EFVS sensor imagery and aircraft flight symbology (i.e., at 
least airspeed, vertical speed, aircraft attitude, heading, altitude, 
command guidance as appropriate for the approach to be flown, path 
deviation indications, and flight path vector, and flight path angle 
reference cue) are presented on a head-up display, or an equivalent 
display, so that they are clearly visible to the pilot flying in his or 
her normal position and line of vision and looking

[[Page 227]]

forward along the flight path, to include:
    (i) The displayed EFVS imagery, attitude symbology, flight path 
vector, and flight path angle reference cue, and other cues, which are 
referenced to this imagery and external scene topography, must be 
presented so that they are aligned with and scaled to the external view; 
and
    (ii) The flight path angle reference cue must be displayed with the 
pitch scale, selectable by the pilot to the desired descent angle for 
the approach, and suitable for monitoring the vertical flight path of 
the aircraft on approaches without vertical guidance; and
    (iii) The displayed imagery and aircraft flight symbology do not 
adversely obscure the pilot's outside view or field of view through the 
cockpit window;
    (3) The EFVS includes the display element, sensors, computers and 
power supplies, indications, and controls. It may receive inputs from an 
airborne navigation system or flight guidance system; and
    (4) The display characteristics and dynamics are suitable for manual 
control of the aircraft.

<R05>
Sec. 91.177  Minimum altitudes for IFR operations.

    (a) Operation of aircraft at minimum altitudes. Except when 
necessary for takeoff or landing, no person may operate an aircraft 
under IFR below--
    (1) The applicable minimum altitudes prescribed in parts 95 and 97 
of this chapter; or
    (2) If no applicable minimum altitude is prescribed in those parts--
    (i) In the case of operations over an area designated as a 
mountainous area in part 95, an altitude of 2,000 feet above the highest 
obstacle within a horizontal distance of 4 nautical miles from the 
course to be flown; or
    (ii) In any other case, an altitude of 1,000 feet above the highest 
obstacle within a horizontal distance of 4 nautical miles from the 
course to be flown.

However, if both a MEA and a MOCA are prescribed for a particular route 
or route segment, a person may operate an aircraft below the MEA down 
to, but not below, the MOCA, when within 22 nautical miles of the VOR 
concerned (based on the pilot's reasonable estimate of that distance).
    (b) Climb. Climb to a higher minimum IFR altitude shall begin 
immediately after passing the point beyond which that minimum altitude 
applies, except that when ground obstructions intervene, the point 
beyond which that higher minimum altitude applies shall be crossed at or 
above the applicable MCA.


<R05>
Sec. 91.179  IFR cruising altitude or flight level.

    (a) In controlled airspace. Each person operating an aircraft under 
IFR in level cruising flight in controlled airspace shall maintain the 
altitude or flight level assigned that aircraft by ATC. However, if the 
ATC clearance assigns ``VFR conditions on-top,'' that person shall 
maintain an altitude or flight level as prescribed by Sec. 91.159.
    (b) In uncontrolled airspace. Except while in a holding pattern of 2 
minutes or less or while turning, each person operating an aircraft 
under IFR in level cruising flight in uncontrolled airspace shall 
maintain an appropriate altitude as follows:
    (1) When operating below 18,000 feet MSL and--
    (i) On a magnetic course of zero degrees through 179 degrees, any 
odd thousand foot MSL altitude (such as 3,000, 5,000, or 7,000); or
    (ii) On a magnetic course of 180 degrees through 359 degrees, any 
even thousand foot MSL altitude (such as 2,000, 4,000, or 6,000).
    (2) When operating at or above 18,000 feet MSL but below flight 
level 290, and--
    (i) On a magnetic course of zero degrees through 179 degrees, any 
odd flight level (such as 190, 210, or 230); or
    (ii) On a magnetic course of 180 degrees through 359 degrees, any 
even flight level (such as 180, 200, or 220).
    (3) When operating at flight level 290 and above in non-RVSM 
airspace, and--
    (i) On a magnetic course of zero degrees through 179 degrees, any 
flight level, at 4,000-foot intervals, beginning at and including flight 
level 290 (such as flight level 290, 330, or 370); or

[[Page 228]]

    (ii) On a magnetic course of 180 degrees through 359 degrees, any 
flight level, at 4,000-foot intervals, beginning at and including flight 
level 310 (such as flight level 310, 350, or 390).
    (4) When operating at flight level 290 and above in airspace 
designated as Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) airspace and--
    (i) On a magnetic course of zero degrees through 179 degrees, any 
odd flight level, at 2,000-foot intervals beginning at and including 
flight level 290 (such as flight level 290, 310, 330, 350, 370, 390, 
410); or
    (ii) On a magnetic course of 180 degrees through 359 degrees, any 
even flight level, at 2000-foot intervals beginning at and including 
flight level 300 (such as 300, 320, 340, 360, 380, 400).

<R05>
Sec. 91.181  Course to be flown.

    Unless otherwise authorized by ATC, no person may operate an 
aircraft within controlled airspace under IFR except as follows:
    (a) On a Federal airway, along the centerline of that airway.
    (b) On any other route, along the direct course between the 
navigational aids or fixes defining that route. However, this section 
does not prohibit maneuvering the aircraft to pass well clear of other 
air traffic or the maneuvering of the aircraft in VFR conditions to 
clear the intended flight path both before and during climb or descent.


<R05>
Sec. 91.183  IFR radio communications.

    The pilot in command of each aircraft operated under IFR in 
controlled airspace shall have a continuous watch maintained on the 
appropriate frequency and shall report by radio as soon as possible--
    (a) The time and altitude of passing each designated reporting 
point, or the reporting points specified by ATC, except that while the 
aircraft is under radar control, only the passing of those reporting 
points specifically requested by ATC need be reported;
    (b) Any unforecast weather conditions encountered; and
    (c) Any other information relating to the safety of flight.


<R05>
Sec. 91.185  IFR operations: Two-way radio communications failure.

    (a) General. Unless otherwise authorized by ATC, each pilot who has 
two-way radio communications failure when operating under IFR shall 
comply with the rules of this section.
    (b) VFR conditions. If the failure occurs in VFR conditions, or if 
VFR conditions are encountered after the failure, each pilot shall 
continue the flight under VFR and land as soon as practicable.
    (c) IFR conditions. If the failure occurs in IFR conditions, or if 
paragraph (b) of this section cannot be complied with, each pilot shall 
continue the flight according to the following:
    (1) Route. (i) By the route assigned in the last ATC clearance 
received;
    (ii) If being radar vectored, by the direct route from the point of 
radio failure to the fix, route, or airway specified in the vector 
clearance;
    (iii) In the absence of an assigned route, by the route that ATC has 
advised may be expected in a further clearance; or
    (iv) In the absence of an assigned route or a route that ATC has 
advised may be expected in a further clearance, by the route filed in 
the flight plan.
    (2) Altitude. At the highest of the following altitudes or flight 
levels for the route segment being flown:

[[Page 229]]

    (i) The altitude or flight level assigned in the last ATC clearance 
received;
    (ii) The minimum altitude (converted, if appropriate, to minimum 
flight level as prescribed in Sec. 91.121(c)) for IFR operations; or
    (iii) The altitude or flight level ATC has advised may be expected 
in a further clearance.
    (3) Leave clearance limit. (i) When the clearance limit is a fix 
from which an approach begins, commence descent or descent and approach 
as close as possible to the expect-further-clearance time if one has 
been received, or if one has not been received, as close as possible to 
the estimated time of arrival as calculated from the filed or amended 
(with ATC) estimated time en route.
    (ii) If the clearance limit is not a fix from which an approach 
begins, leave the clearance limit at the expect-further-clearance time 
if one has been received, or if none has been received, upon arrival 
over the clearance limit, and proceed to a fix from which an approach 
begins and commence descent or descent and approach as close as possible 
to the estimated time of arrival as calculated from the filed or amended 
(with ATC) estimated time en route.

    (3) An aircraft subject to the requirements of paragraph (d) or (e) 
of this section; or
    (4) Turbine-powered rotorcraft when the operator elects to inspect 
that rotorcraft in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
    (d) Progressive inspection. Each registered owner or operator of an 
aircraft desiring to use a progressive inspection program must submit a 
written request to the FAA Flight Standards district office having 
jurisdiction over the area in which the applicant is located, and shall 
provide--
    (1) A certificated mechanic holding an inspection authorization, a 
certificated airframe repair station, or the manufacturer of the 
aircraft to supervise or conduct the progressive inspection;
    (2) A current inspection procedures manual available and readily 
understandable to pilot and maintenance personnel containing, in 
detail--
    (i) An explanation of the progressive inspection, including the 
continuity of inspection responsibility, the making of reports, and the 
keeping of records and technical reference material;
    (ii) An inspection schedule, specifying the intervals in hours or 
days when routine and detailed inspections will be performed and 
including instructions for exceeding an inspection interval by not more 
than 10 hours while en route and for changing an inspection interval 
because of service experience;
    (iii) Sample routine and detailed inspection forms and instructions 
for their use; and
    (iv) Sample reports and records and instructions for their use;
    (3) Enough housing and equipment for necessary disassembly and 
proper inspection of the aircraft; and
    (4) Appropriate current technical information for the aircraft.

The frequency and detail of the progressive inspection shall provide for 
the complete inspection of the aircraft within each 12 calendar months 
and be consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations, field service 
experience, and the kind of operation in which the aircraft is engaged. 
The progressive inspection schedule must ensure that the aircraft, at 
all times, will be airworthy and will conform to all applicable FAA 
aircraft specifications, type certificate data sheets, airworthiness 
directives, and other approved data. If the progressive inspection is 
discontinued, the owner or operator shall immediately notify the local 
FAA Flight Standards district office, in writing, of the discontinuance.

91.409(a)(1) is due within 12 calendar months after the last complete 
inspection of the aircraft under the progressive inspection. The 100-
hour inspection under Sec. 91.409(b) is due within 100 hours after that 
complete inspection. A complete inspection of the aircraft, for the 
purpose of determining when the annual and 100-hour inspections are due, 
requires a detailed inspection of the aircraft and all its components in 
accordance with the progressive inspection. A routine inspection of the 
aircraft and a detailed inspection of several components is not 
considered to be a complete inspection.
    (e) Large airplanes (to which part 125 is not applicable), turbojet 
multiengine airplanes, turbopropeller-powered multiengine airplanes, and 
turbine-powered rotorcraft. No person may operate a large airplane, 
turbojet multiengine airplane, turbopropeller-powered multiengine

Sec. 91.611  Authorization for ferry flight with one engine inoperative.

    (a) General. The holder of an air carrier operating certificate or 
an operating certificate issued under part 125 may conduct a ferry 
flight of a four-engine airplane or a turbine-engine-powered airplane 
equipped with three engines, with one engine inoperative, to a base for 
the purpose of repairing that engine subject to the following:
    (1) The airplane model has been test flown and found satisfactory 
for safe flight in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, 
as appropriate. However, each operator who before November 19, 1966, has 
shown that a model of airplane with an engine inoperative is 
satisfactory for safe flight by a test flight conducted in accordance 
with performance data contained in the applicable Airplane Flight Manual 
under paragraph (a)(2) of this section need not repeat the test flight 
for that model.
    (2) The approved Airplane Flight Manual contains the following 
performance data and the flight is conducted in accordance with that 
data:
    (i) Maximum weight.
    (ii) Center of gravity limits.
    (iii) Configuration of the inoperative propeller (if applicable).
    (iv) Runway length for takeoff (including temperature 
accountability).
    (v) Altitude range.
    (vi) Certificate limitations.
    (vii) Ranges of operational limits.
    (viii) Performance information.
    (ix) Operating procedures.
    (3) The operator has FAA approved procedures for the safe operation 
of the airplane, including specific requirements for--
    (i) Limiting the operating weight on any ferry flight to the minimum 
necessary for the flight plus the necessary reserve fuel load;
    (ii) A limitation that takeoffs must be made from dry runways 
unless, based on a showing of actual operating takeoff techniques on wet 
runways with one engine inoperative, takeoffs with full controllability 
from wet runways have been approved for the specific model aircraft and 
included in the Airplane Flight Manual:
    (iii) Operations from airports where the runways may require a 
takeoff or approach over populated areas; and
    (iv) Inspection procedures for determining the operating condition 
of the operative engines.
    (4) No person may take off an airplane under this section if--
    (i) The initial climb is over thickly populated areas; or

[[Page 264]]

    (ii) Weather conditions at the takeoff or destination airport are 
less than those required for VFR flight.
    (5) Persons other than required flight crewmembers shall not be 
carried during the flight.
    (6) No person may use a flight crewmember for flight under this 
section unless that crewmember is thoroughly familiar with the operating 
procedures for one-engine inoperative ferry flight contained in the 
certificate holder's manual and the limitations and performance 
information in the Airplane Flight Manual.
    (b) Flight tests: reciprocating-engine-powered airplanes. The 
airplane performance of a reciprocating-engine-powered airplane with one 
engine inoperative must be determined by flight test as follows:
    (1) A speed not less than 1.3 V<INF>S1</INF> must be chosen at which 
the airplane may be controlled satisfactorily in a climb with the 
critical engine inoperative (with its propeller removed or in a 
configuration desired by the operator and with all other engines 
operating at the maximum power determined in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section.
    (2) The distance required to accelerate to the speed listed in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section and to climb to 50 feet must be 
determined with--
    (i) The landing gear extended;
    (ii) The critical engine inoperative and its propeller removed or in 
a configuration desired by the operator; and
    (iii) The other engines operating at not more than maximum power 
established under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
    (3) The takeoff, flight and landing procedures, such as the 
approximate trim settings, method of power application, maximum power, 
and speed must be established.
    (4) The performance must be determined at a maximum weight not 
greater than the weight that allows a rate of climb of at least 400 feet 
per minute in the en route configuration set forth in Sec. 25.67(d) of 
this chapter in effect on January 31, 1977, at an altitude of 5,000 
feet.
    (5) The performance must be determined using temperature 
accountability for the takeoff field length, computed in accordance with 
Sec. 25.61 of this chapter in effect on January 31, 1977.
    (c) Flight tests: Turbine-engine-powered airplanes. The airplane 
performance of a turbine-engine-powered airplane with one engine 
inoperative must be determined by flight tests, including at least three 
takeoff tests, in accordance with the following:
    (1) Takeoff speeds V<INF>R</INF> and V<INF>2</INF>, not less than 
the corresponding speeds under which the airplane was type certificated 
under Sec. 25.107 of this chapter, must be chosen at which the airplane 
may be controlled satisfactorily with the critical engine inoperative 
(with its propeller removed or in a configuration desired by the 
operator, if applicable) and with all other engines operating at not 
more than the power selected for type certification as set forth in 
Sec. 25.101 of this chapter.
    (2) The minimum takeoff field length must be the horizontal distance 
required to accelerate and climb to the 35-foot height at V<INF>2</INF> 
speed (including any additional speed increment obtained in the tests) 
multiplied by 115 percent and determined with--
    (i) The landing gear extended;
    (ii) The critical engine inoperative and its propeller removed or in 
a configuration desired by the operator (if applicable); and
    (iii) The other engine operating at not more than the power selected 
for type certification as set forth in Sec. 25.101 of this chapter.
    (3) The takeoff, flight, and landing procedures such as the 
approximate trim setting, method of power application, maximum power, 
and speed must be established. The airplane must be satisfactorily 
controllable during the entire takeoff run when operated according to 
these procedures.
    (4) The performance must be determined at a maximum weight not 
greater than the weight determined under Sec. 25.121(c) of this chapter 
but with--
    (i) The actual steady gradient of the final takeoff climb 
requirement not less than 1.2 percent at the end of the takeoff path 
with two critical engines inoperative; and
    (ii) The climb speed not less than the two-engine inoperative trim 
speed for the actual steady gradient of the final

[[Page 265]]

takeoff climb prescribed by paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.
    (5) The airplane must be satisfactorily controllable in a climb with 
two critical engines inoperative. Climb performance may be shown by 
calculations based on, and equal in accuracy to, the results of testing.
    (6) The performance must be determined using temperature 
accountability for takeoff distance and final takeoff climb computed in 
accordance with Sec. 25.101 of this chapter.

For the purpose of paragraphs (c)(4) and (5) of this section, two 
critical engines means two adjacent engines on one side of an airplane 
with four engines, and the center engine and one outboard engine on an 
airplane with three engines.

otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 91.801  Applicability: Relation to part 36.

    (a) This subpart prescribes operating noise limits and related 
requirements that apply, as follows, to the operation of civil aircraft 
in the United States.
    (1) Sections 91.803, 91.805, 91.807, 91.809, and 91.811 apply to 
civil subsonic jet (turbojet) airplanes with maximum weights of more 
than 75,000 pounds and--
    (i) If U.S. registered, that have standard airworthiness 
certificates; or
    (ii) If foreign registered, that would be required by this chapter 
to have a U.S. standard airworthiness certificate in order to conduct 
the operations intended for the airplane were it registered in the 
United States. Those sections apply to operations to or from airports in 
the United States under this part and parts 121, 125, 129, and 135 of 
this chapter.
    (2) Section 91.813 applies to U.S. operators of civil subsonic jet 
(turbojet) airplanes covered by this subpart. This section applies to 
operators operating to or from airports in the United States under this 
part and parts 121, 125, and 135, but not to those operating under part 
129 of this chapter.
    (3) Sections 91.803, 91.819, and 91.821 apply to U.S.-registered 
civil supersonic airplanes having standard airworthiness certificates 
and to foreign-registered civil supersonic airplanes that, if registered 
in the United States, would be required by this chapter to have U.S. 
standard airworthiness certificates in order to conduct the operations 
intended for the airplane. Those sections apply to operations under this 
part and under parts 121, 125, 129, and 135 of this chapter.
    (b) Unless otherwise specified, as used in this subpart ``part 36'' 
refers to 14 CFR part 36, including the noise levels under appendix C of 
that part, notwithstanding the provisions of that part excepting certain 
airplanes from the specified noise requirements. For purposes of this 
subpart, the various stages of noise levels, the terms used to describe 
airplanes with respect to those levels, and the terms ``subsonic 
airplane'' and ``supersonic airplane'' have the meanings specified under 
part 36 of this chapter. For purposes of this subpart, for subsonic 
airplanes operated in

[[Page 269]]

foreign air commerce in the United States, the Administrator may accept 
compliance with the noise requirements under annex 16 of the 
International Civil Aviation Organization when those requirements have 
been shown to be substantially compatible with, and achieve results 
equivalent to those achievable under, part 36 for that airplane. 
Determinations made under these provisions are subject to the 
limitations of Sec. 36.5 of this chapter as if those noise levels were 
part 36 noise levels.
    (c) Sections 91.851 through 91.877 of this subpart prescribe 
operating noise limits and related requirements that apply to any civil 
subsonic jet (turbojet) airplane (for which an airworthiness certificate 
other than an experimental certificate has been issued by the 
Administrator) with a maximum certificated takeoff weight of more than 
75,000 pounds operating to or from an airport in the 48 contiguous 
United States and the District of Columbia under this part, parts 121, 
125, 129, or 135 of this chapter on and after September 25, 1991.

Sec. 91.1001  Applicability.

    (a) This subpart prescribes rules, in addition to those prescribed 
in other subparts of this part, that apply to fractional owners and 
fractional ownership program managers governing--
    (1) The provision of program management services in a fractional 
ownership program;

[[Page 278]]

    (2) The operation of a fractional ownership program aircraft in a 
fractional ownership program; and
    (3) The operation of a program aircraft included in a fractional 
ownership program managed by an affiliate of the manager of the program 
to which the owner belongs.
    (b) As used in this part--
    (1) Affiliate of a program manager means a manager that, directly, 
or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is 
controlled by, or is under common control with, another program manager. 
The holding of at least forty percent (40 percent) of the equity and 
forty percent (40 percent) of the voting power of an entity will be 
presumed to constitute control for purposes of determining an 
affiliation under this subpart.
    (2) A dry-lease aircraft exchange means an arrangement, documented 
by the written program agreements, under which the program aircraft are 
available, on an as needed basis without crew, to each fractional owner.
    (3) A fractional owner or owner means an individual or entity that 
possesses a minimum fractional ownership interest in a program aircraft 
and that has entered into the applicable program agreements; provided, 
however, that in the case of the flight operations described in 
paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section, and solely for purposes of 
requirements pertaining to those flight operations, the fractional owner 
operating the aircraft will be deemed to be a fractional owner in the 
program managed by the affiliate.
    (4) A fractional ownership interest means the ownership of an 
interest or holding of a multi-year leasehold interest and/or a multi-
year leasehold interest that is convertible into an ownership interest 
in a program aircraft.
    (5) A fractional ownership program or program means any system of 
aircraft ownership and exchange that consists of all of the following 
elements:
    (i) The provision for fractional ownership program management 
services by a single fractional ownership program manager on behalf of 
the fractional owners.
    (ii) Two or more airworthy aircraft.
    (iii) One or more fractional owners per program aircraft, with at 
least one program aircraft having more than one owner.
    (iv) Possession of at least a minimum fractional ownership interest 
in one or more program aircraft by each fractional owner.
    (v) A dry-lease aircraft exchange arrangement among all of the 
fractional owners.
    (vi) Multi-year program agreements covering the fractional 
ownership, fractional ownership program management services, and dry-
lease aircraft exchange aspects of the program.
    (6) A fractional ownership program aircraft or program aircraft 
means:
    (i) An aircraft in which a fractional owner has a minimal fractional 
ownership interest and that has been included in the dry-lease aircraft 
exchange pursuant to the program agreements, or
    (ii) In the case of a fractional owner from one program operating an 
aircraft in a different fractional ownership program managed by an 
affiliate of the operating owner's program manager, the aircraft being 
operated by the fractional owner, so long as the aircraft is:
    (A) Included in the fractional ownership program managed by the 
affiliate of the operating owner's program manager, and
    (B) Included in the operating owner's program's dry-lease aircraft 
exchange pursuant to the program agreements of the operating owner's 
program.
    (iii) An aircraft owned in whole or in part by the program manager 
that has been included in the dry-lease aircraft exchange and is used to 
supplement program operations.
    (7) A Fractional Ownership Program Flight or Program Flight means a 
flight under this subpart when one or more passengers or property 
designated by a fractional owner are on board the aircraft.
    (8) Fractional ownership program management services or program 
management services mean administrative and aviation support services 
furnished in accordance with the applicable requirements of this subpart 
or provided by the program manager on behalf of the fractional owners, 
including, but not limited to, the--
    (i) Establishment and implementation of program safety guidelines;

[[Page 279]]

    (ii) Employment, furnishing, or contracting of pilots and other 
crewmembers;
    (iii) Training and qualification of pilots and other crewmembers and 
personnel;
    (iv) Scheduling and coordination of the program aircraft and crews;

the entity that offers fractional ownership program management services 
to fractional owners, and is designated in the multi-year program 
agreements referenced in paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section to fulfill 
the requirements of this chapter applicable to the manager of the 
program containing the aircraft being flown. When a fractional owner is 
operating an aircraft in a fractional ownership program managed by an 
affiliate of the owner's program manager, the references in this subpart 
to the flight-related responsibilities of the program manager apply, 
with respect to that particular flight, to the affiliate of the owner's 
program manager rather than to the owner's program manager.
    (10) A minimum fractional ownership interest means--
    (i) A fractional ownership interest equal to, or greater than, one-
sixteenth (\1/16\) of at least one subsonic, fixed-wing or powered-lift

<R05>
Sec. 91.1009  Clarification of operational control.

    (a) An owner is in operational control of a program flight when the 
owner--
    (1) Has the rights and is subject to the limitations set forth in 
Sec. Sec. 91.1003 through 91.1013;
    (2) Has directed that a program aircraft carry passengers or 
property designated by that owner; and
    (3) The aircraft is carrying those passengers or property.
    (b) An owner is not in operational control of a flight in the 
following circumstances:
    (1) A program aircraft is used for a flight for administrative 
purposes such as demonstration, positioning, ferrying, maintenance, or 
crew training, and no passengers or property designated by such owner 
are being carried; or
    (2) The aircraft being used for the flight is being operated under 
part 121 or 135 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 91.1011  Operational control responsibilities and delegation.

    (a) Each owner in operational control of a program flight is 
ultimately responsible for safe operations and for complying with all 
applicable requirements of this chapter, including those related to 
airworthiness and operations in connection with the flight. Each owner 
may delegate some or all of the performance of the tasks associated with 
carrying out this responsibility to the program manager, and may rely on 
the program manager for aviation expertise and program management 
services. When the owner delegates performance of tasks to the program 
manager or relies on the program manager's expertise, the owner and the 
program manager are jointly and individually responsible for compliance.
    (b) The management specifications, authorizations, and approvals 
required by this subpart are issued to, and in the sole name of, the 
program manager on behalf of the fractional owners collectively. The 
management specifications, authorizations, and approvals will not be 
affected by any change in ownership of a program aircraft, as long as 
the aircraft remains a program aircraft in the identified program.


<R05>
Sec. 91.1013  Operational control briefing and acknowledgment.

    (a) Upon the signing of an initial program management services 
contract, or a renewal or extension of a program management services 
contract, the program manager must brief the fractional owner on the 
owner's operational control responsibilities, and the owner must review 
and sign an acknowledgment of these operational control 
responsibilities. The acknowledgment must be included with the program 
management services contract. The acknowledgment must define when a 
fractional owner is in operational control and the owner's 
responsibilities and liabilities under the program. These include:

[[Page 281]]

    (1) Responsibility for compliance with the management specifications 
and all applicable regulations.
    (2) Enforcement actions for any noncompliance.
    (3) Liability risk in the event of a flight-related occurrence that 
causes personal injury or property damage.
    (b) The fractional owner's signature on the acknowledgment will 
serve as the owner's affirmation that the owner has read, understands, 
and accepts the operational control responsibilities described in the 
acknowledgment.
    (c) Each program manager must ensure that the fractional owner or 
owner's representatives have access to the acknowledgments for such 
owner's program aircraft. Each program manager must ensure that the FAA 
has access to the acknowledgments for all program aircraft.

Sec. 91.1037  Large transport category airplanes: Turbine engine powered; 
Limitations; Destination and alternate airports.

    (a) No program manager or any other person may permit a turbine 
engine powered large transport category airplane on a program flight to 
take off

[[Page 289]]

that airplane at a weight that (allowing for normal consumption of fuel 
and oil in flight to the destination or alternate airport) the weight of 
the airplane on arrival would exceed the landing weight in the Airplane 
Flight Manual for the elevation of the destination or alternate airport 
and the ambient temperature expected at the time of landing.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, no program 
manager or any other person may permit a turbine engine powered large 
transport category airplane on a program flight to take off that 
airplane unless its weight on arrival, allowing for normal consumption 
of fuel and oil in flight (in accordance with the landing distance in 
the Airplane Flight Manual for the elevation of the destination airport 
and the wind conditions expected there at the time of landing), would 
allow a full stop landing at the intended destination airport within 60 
percent of the effective length of each runway described below from a 
point 50 feet above the intersection of the obstruction clearance plane 
and the runway. For the purpose of determining the allowable landing 
weight at the destination airport, the following is assumed:
    (1) The airplane is landed on the most favorable runway and in the 
most favorable direction, in still air.
    (2) The airplane is landed on the most suitable runway considering 
the probable wind velocity and direction and the ground handling 
characteristics of that airplane, and considering other conditions such 
as landing aids and terrain.
    (c) A program manager or other person flying a turbine engine 
powered large transport category airplane on a program flight may permit 
that airplane to take off at a weight in excess of that allowed by 
paragraph (b) of this section if all of the following conditions exist:
    (1) The operation is conducted in accordance with an approved 
Destination Airport Analysis in that person's program operating manual 
that contains the elements listed in Sec. 91.1025(o).
    (2) The airplane's weight on arrival, allowing for normal 
consumption of fuel and oil in flight (in accordance with the landing 
distance in the Airplane Flight Manual for the elevation of the 
destination airport and the wind conditions expected there at the time 
of landing), would allow a full stop landing at the intended destination 
airport within 80 percent of the effective length of each runway 
described below from a point 50 feet above the intersection of the 
obstruction clearance plane and the runway. For the purpose of 
determining the allowable landing weight at the destination airport, the 
following is assumed:
    (i) The airplane is landed on the most favorable runway and in the 
most favorable direction, in still air.
    (ii) The airplane is landed on the most suitable runway considering 
the probable wind velocity and direction and the ground handling 
characteristics of that airplane, and considering other conditions such 
as landing aids and terrain.
    (3) The operation is authorized by management specifications.
    (d) No program manager or other person may select an airport as an 
alternate airport for a turbine engine powered large transport category 
airplane unless (based on the assumptions in paragraph (b) of this 
section) that airplane, at the weight expected at the time of arrival, 
can be brought to a full stop landing within 80 percent of the effective 
length of the runway from a point 50 feet above the intersection of the 
obstruction clearance plane and the runway.
    (e) Unless, based on a showing of actual operating landing 
techniques on wet runways, a shorter landing distance (but never less 
than that required by paragraph (b) or (c) of this section) has been 
approved for a specific type and model airplane and included in the 
Airplane Flight Manual, no person may take off a turbojet airplane when 
the appropriate weather reports or forecasts, or any combination of 
them, indicate that the runways at the destination or alternate airport 
may be wet or slippery at the estimated time of arrival unless the 
effective runway length at the destination airport is at least 115 
percent of the runway length required under paragraph (b) or (c) of this 
section.

Sec. 91.1039  IFR takeoff, approach and landing minimums.

    (a) No pilot on a program aircraft operating a program flight may 
begin an instrument approach procedure to an airport unless--
    (1) Either that airport or the alternate airport has a weather 
reporting facility operated by the U.S. National Weather Service, a 
source approved by the U.S. National Weather Service, or a source 
approved by the Administrator; and
    (2) The latest weather report issued by the weather reporting 
facility includes a current local altimeter setting for the destination 
airport. If no local altimeter setting is available at the destination 
airport, the pilot must obtain the current local altimeter setting from 
a source provided by the facility designated on the approach chart for 
the destination airport.
    (b) For flight planning purposes, if the destination airport does

Sec. 91.1057  Flight, duty and rest time requirements: All crewmembers.

    (a) For purposes of this subpart--
    Augmented flight crew means at least three pilots.
    Calendar day means the period of elapsed time, using Coordinated 
Universal Time or local time that begins at midnight and ends 24 hours 
later at the next midnight.
    Duty period means the period of elapsed time between reporting for 
an assignment involving flight time and release from that assignment by 
the program manager. All time between these two points is part of the 
duty period, even if flight time is interrupted by nonflight-related 
duties. The time is calculated using either Coordinated Universal Time 
or local time to reflect the total elapsed time.
    Extension of flight time means an increase in the flight time 
because of circumstances beyond the control of the program manager or 
flight crewmember (such as adverse weather) that are not known at the 
time of departure and that prevent the flightcrew from reaching the 
destination within the planned flight time.
    Flight attendant means an individual, other than a flight 
crewmember, who is assigned by the program manager, in accordance with 
the required minimum crew complement under the program manager's 
management specifications or in addition to that minimum complement, to 
duty in an aircraft during flight time and whose duties include but are 
not necessarily limited to cabin-safety-related responsibilities.
    Multi-time zone flight means an easterly or westerly flight or 
multiple flights in one direction in the same duty period that results 
in a time zone difference of 5 or more hours and is conducted in a 
geographic area that is south of 60 degrees north latitude and north of 
60 degrees south latitude.
    Reserve status means that status in which a flight crewmember, by 
arrangement with the program manager: Holds himself or herself fit to 
fly to the extent that this is within the control of the flight 
crewmember; remains within a reasonable response time of the aircraft as 
agreed between the flight crewmember and the program manager; and 
maintains a ready means whereby the flight crewmember may be contacted 
by the program manager. Reserve status is not part of any duty period or 
rest period.
    Rest period means a period of time required pursuant to this subpart 
that is free of all responsibility for work or duty prior to the 
commencement of, or following completion of, a duty period, and during 
which the flight crewmember or flight attendant cannot be required to 
receive contact from the program manager. A rest period does not include 
any time during which the program manager imposes on a flight crewmember 
or flight attendant any duty or restraint, including any actual work or 
present responsibility for work should the occasion arise.
    Standby means that portion of a duty period during which a flight 
crewmember is subject to the control of the program manager and holds 
himself or herself in a condition of readiness to undertake a flight. 
Standby is not part of any rest period.
    (b) A program manager may assign a crewmember and a crewmember may 
accept an assignment for flight time only when the applicable 
requirements of this section and Sec. Sec. 91.1059-91.1062 are met.

[[Page 295]]

    (c) No program manager may assign any crewmember to any duty during 
any required rest period.
    (d) Time spent in transportation, not local in character, that a 
program manager requires of a crewmember and provides to transport the 
crewmember to an airport at which he or she is to serve on a flight as a 
crewmember, or from an airport at which he or she was relieved from duty 
to return to his or her home station, is not considered part of a rest 
period.
    (e) A flight crewmember may continue a flight assignment if the 
flight to which he or she is assigned would normally terminate within 
the flight time limitations, but because of circumstances beyond the 
control of the program manager or flight crewmember (such as adverse 
weather conditions), is not at the time of departure expected to reach 
its destination within the planned flight time. The extension of flight 
time under this paragraph may not exceed the maximum time limits set 
forth in Sec. 91.1059.
    (f) Each flight assignment must provide for at least 10 consecutive 
hours of rest during the 24-hour period that precedes the completion 
time of the assignment.
    (g) The program manager must provide each crewmember at least 13 
rest periods of at least 24 consecutive hours each in each calendar 
quarter.
    (h) A flight crewmember may decline a flight assignment if, in the 
flight crewmember's determination, to do so would not be consistent with 
the standard of safe operation required under this subpart, this part, 
and applicable provisions of this title.
    (i) Any rest period required by this subpart may occur concurrently 
with any other rest period.
    (j) If authorized by the Administrator, a program manager may use 
the applicable unscheduled flight time limitations, duty period 
limitations, and rest requirements of part 121 or part 135 of this 
chapter instead of the flight time limitations, duty period limitations, 
and rest requirements of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 91.1059  Flight time limitations and rest requirements: One or 
two pilot crews.

    (a) No program manager may assign any flight crewmember, and no

to accepted standards.

    (a) If a crewmember who is required to take a test or a flight check 
under this subpart, completes the test or flight check in the month 
before or after the month in which it is required, that crewmember is 
considered to have completed the test or check in the month in which it 
is required.
    (b) If a pilot being checked under this subpart fails any of the 
required maneuvers, the person giving the check may give additional 
training to the pilot during the course of the check. In addition to 
repeating the maneuvers failed, the person giving the check may require 
the pilot being checked to repeat any other maneuvers that are necessary 
to determine the pilot's proficiency. If the pilot being checked is 
unable to demonstrate satisfactory performance to the person conducting 
the check, the program manager may not use the pilot, nor may the pilot 
serve, as a flight crewmember in operations under this subpart until the 
pilot has satisfactorily completed the check. If a pilot who 
demonstrates unsatisfactory performance is employed as a pilot for a 
certificate holder operating under part 121, 125, or 135 of this

demonstrations specified in this paragraph. At least 50 ILS approaches 
must be flown with at least five approaches on each of three different 
ILS facilities and no more than one half of the total approaches on any 
one ILS facility. All approaches shall be flown under simulated 
instrument conditions to a 100-foot decision height and 90 percent of 
the total approaches made must be successful. A successful approach is 
one in which--
    (i) At the 100-foot decision height, the indicated airspeed and 
heading are satisfactory for a normal flare and landing (speed must be 
plus or minus 5 knots of programmed airspeed, but may not be less than 
computed threshold speed if autothrottles are used);
    (ii) The aircraft at the 100-foot decision height, is positioned so 
that the cockpit is within, and tracking so as to remain within, the 
lateral confines of the runway extended;
    (iii) Deviation from glide slope after leaving the outer marker does 
not exceed 50 percent of full-scale deflection as displayed on the ILS 
indicator;
    (iv) No unusual roughness or excessive attitude changes occur after 
leaving the middle marker; and
    (v) In the case of an aircraft equipped with an approach coupler, 
the aircraft is sufficiently in trim when the approach coupler is 
disconnected at the decision height to allow for the continuation of a 
normal approach and landing.
    (3) Records. During the evaluation program the following information 
must be maintained by the applicant for the aircraft with respect to 
each approach and made available to the Adninistrator upon request:
    (i) Each deficiency in airborne instruments and equipment that 
prevented the initiation of an approach.
    (ii) The reasons for discontinuing an approach, including the 
altitude above the runway at which it was discontinued.
    (iii) Speed control at the 100-foot decision height if auto 
throttles are used.
    (iv) Trim condition of the aircraft upon disconnecting the auto 
coupler with respect to continuation to flare and landing.
    (v) Position of the aircraft at the middle marker and at the 
decision height indicated both on a diagram of the basic ILS display and 
a diagram of the runway extended to the middle marker. Estimated 
touchdown point must be indicated on the runway diagram.
    (vi) Compatibility of flight director with the auto coupler, if 
applicable.
    (vii) Quality of overall system performance.
    (4) Evaluation. A final evaluation of the flight control guidance 
system is made upon successful completion of the demonstrations. If no 
hazardous tendencies have been displayed or are otherwise known to 
exist, the system is approved as installed.

  Appendix B to Part 91--Authorizations to Exceed Mach 1 (Sec. 91.817)

                         Section 1. Application

    (a) An applicant for an authorization to exceed Mach 1 must apply in 
a form and manner prescribed by the Administrator and must comply with 
this appendix.
    (b) In addition, each application for an authorization to exceed 
Mach 1 covered by section 2(a) of this appendix must contain all 
information requested by the Administrator necessary to assist him in 
determining whether the designation of a particular test area or 
issuance of a particular authorization is a ``major Federal action 
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment'' within 
the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 
4321 et seq.), and to assist him in complying with that act and with 
related Executive Orders, guidelines, and orders prior to such action.
    (c) In addition, each application for an authorization to exceed 
Mach 1 covered by section 2(a) of this appendix must contain--
    (1) Information showing that operation at a speed greater than Mach 
1 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes specified in 
section 2(a) of this appendix, including a showing that the purpose of 
the test cannot be safely or properly accomplished by overocean testing;
    (2) A description of the test area proposed by the applicant, 
including an environmental analysis of that area meeting the 
requirements of paragraph (b) of this section; and
    (3) Conditions and limitations that will ensure that no measurable 
sonic boom overpressure will reach the surface outside of the designated 
test area.
    (d) An application is denied if the Administrator finds that such 
action is necessary to protect or enhance the environment.

                           Section 2. Issuance

    (a) For a flight in a designated test area, an authorization to 
exceed Mach 1 may be issued when the Administrator has taken the 
environmental protective actions specified in section 1(b) of this 
appendix and the applicant shows one or more of the following:
    (1) The flight is necessary to show compliance with airworthiness 
requirements.
    (2) The flight is necessary to determine the sonic boom 
characteristics of the airplane or to establish means of reducing or 
eliminating the effects of sonic boom.
    (3) The flight is necessary to demonstrate the conditions and 
limitations under which

[[Page 321]]

speeds greater than a true flight Mach number of 1 will not cause a 
measurable sonic boom overpressure to reach the surface.
    (b) For a flight outside of a designated test area, an authorization 
to exceed Mach 1 may be issued if the applicant shows conservatively 
under paragraph (a)(3) of this section that--
    (1) The flight will not cause a measurable sonic boom overpressure 
to reach the surface when the aircraft is operated under conditions and 
limitations demonstrated under paragraph (a)(3) of this section; and
    (2) Those conditions and limitations represent all foreseeable 
operating conditions.

                           Section 3. Duration

    (a) An authorization to exceed Mach 1 is effective until it expires 
or is surrendered, or until it is suspended or terminated by the 
Administrator. Such an authorization may be amended or suspended by the 
Administrator at any time if the Administrator finds that such action is 
necessary to protect the environment. Within 30 days of notification of 
amendnent, the holder of the authorization must request reconsideration 
or the amendnent becomes final. Within 30 days of notification of 
suspension, the holder of the authorization must request reconsideration 
or the authorization is automatically terminated. If reconsideration is 
requested within the 30-day period, the amendment or suspension 
continues until the holder shows why the authorization should not be 
amended or terminated. Upon such showing, the Administrator may 
terminate or amend the authorization if the Administrator finds that 
such action is necessary to protect the environment, or he may reinstate 
the authorization without amendment if he finds that termination or 
amendnent is not necessary to protect the environment.
    (b) Findings and actions by the Administrator under this section do 
not affect any certificate issued under title VI of the Federal Aviation 
Act of 1958.

 Appendix C to Part 91--Operations in the North Atlantic (NAT) Minimum 
          Navigation Performance Specifications (MNPS) Airspace

                                Section 1

    NAT MNPS airspace is that volume of airspace between FL 285 and FL 
420 extending between latitude 27 degrees north and the North Pole, 
bounded in the east by the eastern boundaries of control areas Santa 
Maria Oceanic, Shanwick Oceanic, and Reykjavik Oceanic and in the west 
by the western boundary of Reykjavik Oceanic Control Area, the western 
boundary of Gander Oceanic Control Area, and the western boundary of New 
York Oceanic Control Area, excluding the areas west of 60 degrees west 
and south of 38 degrees 30 minutes north.

                                Section 2

    The navigation performance capability required for aircraft to be 
operated in the airspace defined in section 1 of this appendix is as 
follows:
    (a) The standard deviation of lateral track errors shall be less 
than 6.3 NM (11.7 Km). Standard deviation is a statistical measure of 
data about a mean value. The mean is zero nautical miles. The overall 
form of data is such that the plus and minus 1 standard deviation about 
the mean encompasses approximately 68 percent of the data and plus or 
minus 2 deviations encompasses approximately 95 percent.
    (b) The proportion of the total flight time spent by aircraft 30 NM 
(55.6 Km) or more off the cleared track shall be less than 5.3 x 
10<SUP>-4</SUP> (less than 1 hour in 1,887 flight hours).
    (c) The proportion of the total flight time spent by aircraft 
between 50 NM and 70 NM (92.6 Km and 129.6 Km) off the cleared track 
shall be less than 13 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP> (less than 1 hour in 7,693 
flight hours.)

                                Section 3

    Air traffic control (ATC) may authorize an aircraft operator to 
deviate from the requirements of Sec. 91.705 for a specific flight if, 
at the time of flight plan filing for that flight, ATC determines that 
the aircraft may be provided appropriate separation and that the flight 
will not interfere with, or impose a burden upon, the operations of 
other aircraft which meet the requirements of Sec. 91.705.

Appendix G to Part 91--Operations in Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum 
                             (RVSM) Airspace

                         Section 1. Definitions

    Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace. Within RVSM 
airspace, air traffic control (ATC) separates aircraft by a minimum of 
1,000 feet vertically between flight level (FL) 290 and FL 410 
inclusive. RVSM airspace is special qualification airspace; the operator 
and the aircraft used by the operator must be approved by the 
Administrator. Air-traffic control notifies operators of RVSM by 
providing route planning information. Section 8 of this appendix 
identifies airspace where RVSM may be applied.
    RVSM Group Aircraft. Aircraft within a group of aircraft, approved 
as a group by the Administrator, in which each of the aircraft satisfy 
each of the following:
    (a) The aircraft have been manufactured to the same design, and have 
been approved under the same type certificate, amended type certificate, 
or supplemental type certificate.
    (b) The static system of each aircraft is installed in a manner and 
position that is the same as those of the other aircraft in the group. 
The same static source error correction is incorporated in each aircraft 
of the group.
    (c) The avionics units installed in each aircraft to meet the 
minimum RVSM equipment requirements of this appendix are:
    (1) Manufactured to the same manufacturer specification and have the 
same part number; or
    (2) Of a different manufacturer or part number, if the applicant 
demonstrates that the equipment provides equivalent system performance.
    RVSM Nongroup Aircraft. An aircraft that is approved for RVSM 
operations as an individual aircraft.
    RVSM Flight envelope. An RVSM flight envelope includes the range of 
Mach number, weight divided by atmospheric pressure ratio, and altitudes 
over which an aircraft is approved to be operated in cruising flight 
within RVSM airspace. RVSM flight envelopes are defined as follows:
    (a) The full RVSM flight envelope is bounded as follows:
    (1) The altitude flight envelope extends from FL 290 upward to the 
lowest altitude of the following:
    (i) FL 410 (the RVSM altitude limit);
    (ii) The maximum certificated altitude for the aircraft; or
    (iii) The altitude limited by cruise thrust, buffet, or other flight 
limitations.
    (2) The airspeed flight envelope extends:
    (i) From the airspeed of the slats/flaps-up maximum endurance 
(holding) airspeed, or the maneuvering airspeed, whichever is lower;
    (ii) To the maximum operating airspeed (V<INF>mo</INF>/
M<INF>mo</INF>), or airspeed limited by cruise thrust buffet, or other 
flight limitations, whichever is lower.
    (3) All permissible gross weights within the flight envelopes 
defined in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this definition.
    (b) The basic RVSM flight envelope is the same as the full RVSM 
flight envelope except that the airspeed flight envelope extends:
    (1) From the airspeed of the slats/flaps-up maximum endurance 
(holding) airspeed, or the maneuver airspeed, whichever is lower;
    (2) To the upper Mach/airspeed boundary defined for the full RVSM 
flight envelope, or a specified lower value not less than the long-range 
cruise Mach number plus .04 Mach, unless further limited by available 
cruise thrust, buffet, or other flight limitations.

                      Section 2. Aircraft Approval

    (a) An operator may be authorized to conduct RVSM operations if the 
Administrator finds that its aircraft comply with this section.

[[Page 326]]

    (b) The applicant for authorization shall submit the appropriate 
data package for aircraft approval. The package must consist of at least 
the following:
    (1) An identification of the RVSM aircraft group or the nongroup 
aircraft;
    (2) A definition of the RVSM flight envelopes applicable to the 
subject aircraft;
    (3) Documentation that establishes compliance with the applicable 
RVSM aircraft requirements of this section; and
    (4) The conformity tests used to ensure that aircraft approved with 
the data package meet the RVSM aircraft requirements.
    (c) Altitude-keeping equipment: All aircraft. To approve an aircraft 
group or a nongroup aircraft, the Administrator must find that the 
aircraft meets the following requirements:
    (1) The aircraft must be equipped with two operational independent 
altitude measurement systems.
    (2) The aircraft must be equipped with at least one automatic 
altitude control system that controls the aircraft altitude--
    (i) Within a tolerance band of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>65 feet about 
an acquired altitude when the aircraft is operated in straight and level 
flight under nonturbulent, nongust conditions; or
    (ii) Within a tolerance band of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>130 feet under 
nonturbulent, nongust conditions for aircraft for which application for 
type certification occurred on or before April 9, 1997 that are equipped 
with an automatic altitude control system with flight management/
performance system inputs.
    (3) The aircraft must be equipped with an altitude alert system that 
signals an alert when the altitude displayed to the flight crew deviates 
from the selected altitude by more than:
    (i) <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>300 feet for aircraft for which 
application for type certification was made on or before April 9, 1997; 
or
    (ii) <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>200 feet for aircraft for which 
application for type certification is made after April 9, 1997.
    (d) Altimetry system error containment: Group aircraft for which 
application for type certification was made on or before April 9, 1997. 
To approve group aircraft for which application for type certification 
was made on or before April 9, 1997, the Administrator must find that 
the altimetry system error (ASE) is contained as follows:
    (1) At the point in the basic RVSM flight envelope where mean ASE 
reaches its largest absolute value, the absolute value may not exceed 80 
feet.
    (2) At the point in the basic RVSM flight envelope where mean ASE 
plus three standard deviations reaches its largest absolute value, the 
absolute value may not exceed 200 feet.
    (3) At the point in the full RVSM flight envelope where mean ASE 
reaches its largest absolute value, the absolute value may not exceed 
120 feet.
    (4) At the point in the full RVSM flight envelope where mean ASE 
plus three standard deviations reaches its largest absolute value, the 
absolute value may not exceed 245 feet.
    (5) Necessary operating restrictions. If the applicant demonstrates 
that its aircraft otherwise comply with the ASE containment 
requirements, the Administrator may establish an operating restriction 
on that applicant's aircraft to restrict the aircraft from operating in 
areas of the basic RVSM flight envelope where the absolute value of mean 
ASE exceeds 80 feet, and/or the absolute value of mean ASE plus three 
standard deviations exceeds 200 feet; or from operating in areas of the 
full RVSM flight envelope where the absolute value of the mean ASE 
exceeds 120 feet and/or the absolute value of the mean ASE plus three 
standard deviations exceeds 245 feet.
    (e) Altimetry system error containment: Group aircraft for which 
application for type certification is made after April 9, 1997. To 
approve group aircraft for which application for type certification is 
made after April 9, 1997, the Administrator must find that the altimetry 
system error (ASE) is contained as follows:
    (1) At the point in the full RVSM flight envelope where mean ASE 
reaches its largest absolute value, the absolute value may not exceed 80 
feet.
    (2) At the point in the full RVSM flight envelope where mean ASE 
plus three standard deviations reaches its largest absolute value, the 
absolute value may not exceed 200 feet.
    (f) Altimetry system error containment: Nongroup aircraft. To 
approve a nongroup aircraft, the Administrator must find that the 
altimetry system error (ASE) is contained as follows:
    (1) For each condition in the basic RVSM flight envelope, the 
largest combined absolute value for residual static source error plus 
the avionics error may not exceed 160 feet.
    (2) For each condition in the full RVSM flight envelope, the largest 
combined absolute value for residual static source error plus the 
avionics error may not exceed 200 feet.
    (g) Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) 
Compatibility With RVSM Operations: All aircraft. After March 31, 2002, 
unless otherwise authorized by the Administrator, if you operate an 
aircraft that is equipped with TCAS II in RVSM airspace, it must be a 
TCAS II that meets TSO C-119b (Version 7.0), or a later version.
    (h) If the Administrator finds that the applicant's aircraft comply 
with this section, the Administrator notifies the applicant in writing.

[[Page 327]]

                    Section 3. Operator Authorization

    (a) Authority for an operator to conduct flight in airspace where 
RVSM is applied is issued in operations specifications, a Letter of 
Authorization, or management specifications issued under subpart K of 
this part, as appropriate. To issue an RVSM authorization, the 
Administrator must find that the operator's aircraft have been approved 
in accordance with Section 2 of this appendix and the operator complies 
with this section.
    (b) An applicant for authorization to operate within RVSM airspace 
shall apply in a form and manner prescribed by the Administrator. The 
application must include the following:
    (1) An approved RVSM maintenance program outlining procedures to 
maintain RVSM aircraft in accordance with the requirements of this 
appendix. Each program must contain the following:
    (i) Periodic inspections, functional flight tests, and maintenance 
and inspection procedures, with acceptable maintenance practices, for 
ensuring continued compliance with the RVSM aircraft requirements.
    (ii) A quality assurance program for ensuring continuing accuracy 
and reliability of test equipment used for testing aircraft to determine 
compliance with the RVSM aircraft requirements.
    (iii) Procedures for returning noncompliant aircraft to service.
    (2) For an applicant who operates under part 121 or 135 of this 
chapter or under subpart K of this part, initial and recurring pilot

RVSM policies and procedures that will enable it to conduct RVSM 
operations safely.
    (c) Validation and Demonstration. In a manner prescribed by the 
Administrator, the operator must provide evidence that:
    (1) It is capable to operate and maintain each aircraft or aircraft 
group for which it applies for approval to operate in RVSM airspace; and
    (2) Each pilot has an adequate knowledge of RVSM requirements, 
policies, and procedures.

                       Section 4. RVSM Operations

    (a) Each person requesting a clearance to operate within RVSM 
airspace shall correctly annotate the flight plan filed with air traffic 
control with the status of the operator and aircraft with regard to RVSM 
approval. Each operator shall verify RVSM applicability for the flight 
planned route through the appropriate flight planning information 
sources.
    (b) No person may show, on the flight plan filed with air traffic 
control, an operator or aircraft as approved for RVSM operations, or 
operate on a route or in an area where RVSM approval is required, 
unless:
    (1) The operator is authorized by the Administrator to perform such 
operations; and
    (2) The aircraft has been approved and complies with the 
requirements of Section 2 of this appendix.

                 Section 5. Deviation Authority Approval

    The Administrator may authorize an aircraft operator to deviate from 
the requirements of Sec. 91.180 or Sec. 91.706 for a specific flight 
in RVSM airspace if that operator has not been approved in accordance 
with section 3 of this appendix if:
    (a) The operator submits a request in a time and manner acceptable 
to the Administrator; and
    (b) At the time of filing the flight plan for that flight, ATC 
determines that the aircraft may be provided appropriate separation and 
that the flight will not interfere with, or impose a burden on, the 
operations of operators who have been approved for RVSM operations in 
accordance with Section 3 of this appendix.

              Section 6. Reporting Altitude-Keeping Errors

    Each operator shall report to the Administrator each event in which 
the operator's aircraft has exhibited the following altitude-keeping 
performance:
    (a) Total vertical error of 300 feet or more;
    (b) Altimetry system error of 245 feet or more; or
    (c) Assigned altitude deviation of 300 feet or more.

              Section 7. Removal or Amendment of Authority

    The Administrator may amend operations specifications or management 
specifications issued under subpart K of this part to revoke or restrict 
an RVSM authorization, or may revoke or restrict an RVSM letter of 
authorization, if the Administrator determines that the operator is not 
complying, or is unable to comply, with this appendix or subpart H of 
this part. Examples of reasons for amendment, revocation, ore 
restriction include, but are not limited to, an operator's:
    (a) Committing one or more altitude-keeping errors in RVSM airspace;
    (b) Failing to make an effective and timely response to identify and 
correct an altitude-keeping error; or
    (c) Failing to report an altitude-keeping error.

                     Section 8. Airspace Designation

    (a) RVSM in the North Atlantic. (1) RVSM may be applied in the NAT 
in the following ICAO Flight Information Regions (FIRs): New York 
Oceanic, Gander Oceanic, Sondrestrom FIR, Reykjavik Oceanic, Shanwick 
Oceanic, and Santa Maria Oceanic.

[[Page 328]]

    (2) RVSM may be effective in the Minimum Navigation Performance 
Specification (MNPS) airspace within the NAT. The MNPS airspace within 
the NAT is defined by the volume of airspace between FL 285 and FL 420 
(inclusive) extending between latitude 27 degrees north and the North 
Pole, bounded in the east by the eastern boundaries of control areas 
Santa Maria Oceanic, Shanwick Oceanic, and Reykjavik Oceanic and in the 
west by the western boundaries of control areas Reykjavik Oceanic,

Subpart E_Flight Restrictions in the Vicinity of Niagara Falls, New York


<R05>
Sec. 93.71  General operating procedures.

    (a) Flight restrictions are in effect below 3,500 feet MSL in the 
airspace above Niagara Falls, New York, west of a line from latitude 
43[deg]06[min]33[sec] N., longitude 79[deg]03[min]30[sec] W. (the 
Whirlpool Rapids Bridge) to latitude 43[deg]04[min]47[sec] N., longitude 
79[deg]02[min]44[sec] W. (the Niagara River Inlet) to latitude 
43[deg]04[min]29[sec] N., longitude 79[deg]03[min]30[sec] W. (the 
International Control Dam) to the United States/Canadian Border and 
thence along the border to the point of origin.
    (b) No flight is authorized below 3,500 feet MSL in the area 
described in paragraph (a) of this section, except for aircraft 
operations conducted directly to or from an airport/heliport within the 
area, aircraft operating on an ATC-approved IFR flight plan, aircraft 
operating the Scenic Falls Route pursuant to approval of Transport 
Canada, aircraft carrying law enforcement officials, or aircraft 
carrying properly accredited news representatives for which a flight 
plan has been filed with Buffalo NY (BUF) Automated Flight Service 
Station (AFSS).
    (c) Check with Transport Canada for flight restrictions in Canadian 
airspace. Commercial air tour operations approved by Transport Canada 
will be conducting a north/south orbit of the Niagara Falls area below 
3,500 feet MSL over the Niagara River.
    (d) The minimum altitude for VFR flight over the Scenic Falls area 
is 3,500 feet MSL.
    (e) Comply with the following procedures when conducting flight over 
the area described in paragraph (a) of this section:
    (1) Fly a clockwise pattern;
    (2) Do not proceed north of the Rainbow Bridge;
    (3) Prior to joining the pattern, broadcast flight intentions on 
frequency 122.05 Mhz, giving altitude and position, and monitor the 
frequency while in the pattern;
    (4) Use the Niagara Falls airport altimeter setting. Contact Niagara 
Falls Airport Traffic Control Tower to obtain the current altimeter 
setting, to facilitate the exchange of traffic advisories/restrictions,

otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 93.211  Applicability.

    (a) This subpart prescribes rules applicable to the allocation and 
withdrawal of IFR operational authority (takeoffs and landings) to 
individual air carriers and commuter operators at the High Density 
Traffic Airports identified in subpart K of this part except for Newark 
Airport.

[[Page 339]]

    (b) This subpart also prescribes rules concerning the transfer of 
allocated IFR operational authority and the use of that authority once 
allocated.


<R05>
Sec. 93.213  Definitions and general provisions.

    (a) For purposes of this subpart--
    (1) New entrant carrier means a commuter operator or air carrier 
which does not hold a slot at a particular airport and has never sold or 
given up a slot at that airport after December 16, 1985.
    (2) Slot means the operational authority to conduct one IFR landing 
or takeoff operation each day during a specific hour or 30 minute period 
at one of the High Density Traffic Airports, as specified in subpart K 
of this part.
    (3) Summer season means the period of time from the first Sunday in 
April until the last Sunday in October.
    (4) Winter season means the period of time from the last Sunday in 
October until the first Sunday in April.
    (5) Limited incumbent carrier means an air carrier or commuter 
operator that holds or operates fewer than 12 air carrier or commuter 
slots, in any combination, at a particular airport, not including 
international slots, Essential Air Service Program slots, or slots 
between the hours of 2200 and 0659 at Washington National Airport or 
LaGuardia Airport. However, for the purposes of this paragraph (a)(5), 
the carrier is considered to hold the number of slots at that airport 
that the carrier has, since December 16, 1985:
    (i) Returned to the FAA;
    (ii) Had recalled by the FAA under Sec. 93.227(a); or
    (iii) Transferred to another party other than by trade for one or 
more slots at the same airport.
    (b) The definitions specified in subpart K of this part also apply 
to this subpart.
    (c) For purposes of this subpart, if an air carrier, commuter 
operator, or other person has more than a 50-percent ownership or 
control of one or more other air carriers, commuter operators, or other 
persons, they shall be considered to be a single air carrier, commuter 
operator, or person. In addition, if a single company has more than a 
50-percent ownership or control of two or more air carriers and/or 
commuter operators or any combination thereof, those air carriers and/or 
commuter operators shall be considered to be a single operator. A single 
operator may be considered to be both an air carrier and commuter 
operator for purposes of this subpart.

Sec. 93.215  Initial allocation of slots.

    (a) Each air carrier and commuter operator holding a permanent slot 
on December 16, 1985, as evidenced by the records of the air carrier and 
commuter operator scheduling committees, shall be allocated those slots 
subject to withdrawal under the provisions of this subpart. The Chief 
Counsel of the FAA shall be the final decisionmaker for initial 
allocation determinations.
    (b) Any permanent slot whose use on December 16, 1985 is divided 
among different operators, by day of the week, or otherwise, as 
evidenced by records of the scheduling committees, shall be allocated in 
conformity with those records. The Chief Counsel of the FAA shall be the 
final decisionmaker for these determinations.
    (c) A carrier may permanently designate a slot it holds at Kennedy 
International Airport as a seasonal slot, to be held by the carrier only 
during the corresponding season in future years, if it notifies the FAA 
(at the address specified in Sec. 93.225(e)), in writing, the preceding 
winter seasons or by October 15 of the preceding year for summer 
seasons.
    (d) Within 30 days after December 16, 1985, each U.S. air carrier 
and commuter operator must notify the office specified in Sec. 
93.221(a)(1), in writing, of those slots used for operations described 
in Sec. 93.217(a)(1) on December 16, 1985.
    (e) Any slot not held by an operator on December 16, 1985 shall be 
allocated in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 93.217, 93.219 or 
93.225 of this subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 93.217  Allocation of slots for international operations and 
applicable limitations.

    (a) Any air carrier of commuter operator having the authority to 
conduct international operations shall be provided slots for those 
operations, excluding transborder service solely between HDR airports 
and Canada, subject to the following conditions and the other provisions 
of this section:
    (1) The slot may be used only for a flight segment in which either 
the takeoff or landing is at a foreign point or, for foreign operators, 
the flight segment is a continuation of a flight that begins or ends at 
a foreign point. Slots may be obtained and used under this section only 
for operations at Kennedy and O'Hare airports unless otherwise required 
by bilateral agreement and only for scheduled service unless the 
requesting carrier qualifies for the slot on the basis of historic 
seasonal operations, under Sec. 93.217(a)(5).
    (2) Slots used for an operation described in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section may not be bought, sold, leased, or otherwise transferred, 
except that such a slot may be traded to another slot-holder on a one-
for-one basis for a slot at the same airport in a different hour or 
half-hour period if the trade is for the purpose of conducting such an 
operation in a different hour or half-hour period.
    (3) Slots used for operations described in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section must be returned to the FAA if the slot will not be used for 
such operations for more than a 2-week period.
    (4) Each air carrier or commuter operator having a slot that is used 
for operations described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section but is not 
used every day of the week shall notify the office specified in Sec. 
93.221(a)(1) in writing of those days on which the slots will not be 
used.
    (5) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(10) of this section, at 
Kennedy and O'Hare Airports, a slot shall be allocated, upon request, 
for seasonal international operations, including charter operations, if 
the Chief Counsel of the FAA determines that the slot had been 
permanently allocated to and used by the requesting carrier in the same 
hour and for the same time period during the corresponding season of the 
preceding year. Requests for such slots must be submitted to the office 
specified in Sec. 93.221(a)(1), by the deadline published in a Federal 
Register notice for each season. For operations during the 1986 summer 
season, requests under this paragraph must have been submitted to the 
FAA on or before February 1, 1986. Each carrier requesting a slot under 
this paragraph must submit its entire international schedule at the 
relevant airport for the particular season, noting which requests are in 
addition to or changes from the previous year.
    (6) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(10) of this section, 
additional slots shall be allocated at O'Hare Airport for international 
scheduled air carrier and commuter operations (beyond those slots 
allocated under Sec. Sec. 93.215 and 93.217(a)(5) if a request is 
submitted to the office specified in Sec. 93.221(a)(1) and filed by the 
deadline published in a Federal Register notice for each season. These 
slots will be allocated at the time requested unless a slot is available 
within one hour of the requested time, in which case the unallocated 
slots will be used to satisfy the request.
    (7) If required by bilateral agreement, additional slots shall be 
allocated at LaGuardia Airport for international scheduled passenger 
operations within the hour requested.
    (8) To the extent vacant slots are available, additional slots 
during the high density hours shall be allocated at Kennedy Airport for 
new international scheduled air carrier and commuter operations (beyond 
those operations for which slots have been allocated under Sec. Sec. 
93.215 and 93.217(a)(5)), if a request is submitted to the office 
specified in Sec. 93.221(a)(1) by the deadline published in a Federal 
Register notice for each season. In addition, slots may be withdrawn 
from domestic operations for operations at Kennedy Airport under this 
paragraph if required by international obligations.
    (9) In determining the hour in which a slot request under Sec. Sec. 
93.217(a)(6) and 93.217(a)(8) will be granted, the following will be 
taken into consideration, among other things:

[[Page 341]]

    (i) The availability of vacant slot times;
    (ii) International obligations;
    (iii) Airport terminal capacity, including facilities and personnel 
of the U.S. Customs Service and the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization 
Service;
    (iv) The extent and regularity of intended use of a slot; and
    (v) Schedule constraints of carriers requesting slots.
    (10) At O'Hare Airport, a slot will not be allocated under this 
section to a carrier holding or operating 100 or more permanent slots on 
the previous May 15 for a winter season or October 15 for a summer 
season unless:
    (i) Allocation of the slot does not result in a total allocation to 
that carrier under this section that exceeds the number of slots 
allocated to and scheduled by that carrier under this section on 
February 23, 1990, and as reduced by the number of slots reclassified 
under Sec. 93.218, and does not exceed by more than 2 the number of 
slots allocated to and scheduled by that carrier during any half hour of 
that day, or
    (ii) Notwithstanding the number of slots allocated under paragraph 
(a)(10)(i) of this section, a slot is available for allocation without 
withdrawal of a permanent slot from any carrier.
    (b) If a slot allocated under Sec. 93.215 was scheduled for an 
operation described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section on December 16, 
1985, its use shall be subject to the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) 
through (a)(4) of this section. The requirements also apply to slots 
used for international operations at LaGuardia Airport.
    (c) If a slot is offered to a carrier in other than the hour 
requested, the carrier shall have 14 days after the date of the offer to 
accept the newly offered slot. Acceptance must be in writing and sent to 
the office specified in Sec. 93.221(a)(1) and must repeat the certified 
statements required by paragraph (e) of this section.
    (d) The Office of the Secretary of Transportation reserves the right 
not to apply the provisions of this section, concerning the allocation 
of slots, to any foreign air carrier or commuter operator of a country 
that provides slots to U.S. air carriers and commuter operators on a 
basis more restrictive than provided by this subpart. Decisions not to 
apply the provisions of this section will be made by the Office of the 
Secretary of Transportation.
    (e) Each request for slots under this section shall state the 
airport, days of the week and time of the day of the desired slots and 
the period of time the slots are to be used. Each request shall identify 
whether the slot is requested under paragraph (a)(5), (6), or (8) and 
identify any changes from the previous year if requested under both 
paragraphs. The request must be accompanied by a certified statement 
signed by an officer of the operator indicating that the operator has or 
has contracted for aircraft capable of being utilized in using the slots 
requested and that the operator has bona fide plans to use the requested 
slots for operations described in paragraph (a).

Sec. 93.218  Slots for transborder service to and from Canada.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, international 
slots identified by U.S. carriers for international operations in 
December 1985 and the equivalent number of international slots held as 
of February 24, 1998, will be domestic slots. The Chief Counsel of the 
FAA shall be the final decisionmaker for these determinations.
    (b) Canadian carriers shall have a guaranteed base level of slots of 
42 slots at LaGuardia, 36 slots at O'Hare for the Sumner season, and 32 
slots at O'Hare in the Winter season.
    (c) Any modification to the slot base by the Government of Canada or 
the Canadian carriers that results in a decrease of the guaranteed base 
in paragraph (b) of this section shall permanently modify the base 
number of slots.

Sec. 93.219  Allocation of slots for essential air service operations 
and applicable limitations.

    Whenever the Office of the Secretary of Transportation determines 
that slots are needed for operations to or

[[Page 342]]

from a High Density Traffic Airport under the Department of 
Transportation's Essential Air Service (EAS) Program, those slots shall 
be provided to the designated air carrier or commuter operator subject 
to the following limitations:
    (a) Slots obtained under this section may not be bought, sold, 
leased or otherwise transferred, except that such slots may be traded 
for other slots on a one-for-one basis at the same airport.
    (b) Any slot obtained under this section must be returned to the FAA 
if it will not be used for EAS purposes for more than a 2-week period. A 
slot returned under this paragraph may be reallocated to the operator 
which returned it upon request to the FAA office specified in Sec. 
93.221(a)(1) if that slot has not been reallocated to an operator to 
provide substitute essential air service.
    (c) Slots shall be allocated for EAS purposes in a time period 
within 90 minutes of the time period requested.
    (d) The Department will not honor requests for slots for EAS 
purposes to a point if the requesting carrier has previously traded away 
or sold slots it had used or obtained for use in providing essential air 
service to that point.
    (e) Slots obtained under Civil Aeronautics Board Order No. 84-11-40 
shall be considered to have been obtained under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 93.221  Transfer of slots.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, effective April 1, 
1986, slots may be bought, sold or leased for any consideration and any 
time period and they may be traded in any combination for slots at the 
same airport or any other high density traffic airport. Transfers, 
including leases, shall comply with the following conditions:
    (1) Requests for confirmation must be submitted in writing to Slot 
Administration Office, AGC-230, Office of the Chief Counsel, Federal 
Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 
20591, in a format to be prescribed by the Administrator. Requests will 
provide the names of the transferor and recipient; business address and 
telephone number of the persons representing the transferor and 
recipient; whether the slot is to be used for an arrival or departure; 
the date the slot was acquired by the transferor; the section of this 
subpart under which the slot was allocated to the transferor; whether 
the slot has been used by the transferor for international or essential 
air service operations; and whether the slot will be used by the 
recipient for international or essential air service operations. After 
withdrawal priorities have been established under Sec. 93.223 of this 
part, the requests must include the slot designations of the transferred 
slots as described in Sec. 93.223(b)(5).
    (2) The slot transferred must come from the transferor's then-
current FAA-approved base.
    (3) Written evidence of each transferor's consent to the transfer 
must be provided to the FAA.
    (4) The recipient of a transferred slot may not use the slot until 
written confirmation has been received from the FAA.
    (5)(i) Until a slot obtained by a new entrant or limited incumbent 
carrier in a lottery held under Sec. 93.225 after June 1, 1991, has 
been used by the carrier that obtained it for a continuous 24-month 
period after the lottery in accordance with Sec. 93.227(a), that slot 
may be transferred only by trade for one or more slots at the same 
airport or to other new entrant or limited incumbent carriers under 
Sec. 93.221(a)(5)(iii). This transfer restriction shall apply to the 
same extent to any slot or slots acquired by trading the slot obtained 
in a lottery. To remove the transfer restriction, documentation of 24 
months' continuous use must be submitted to the FAA Office of the Chief 
Counsel.
    (ii) Failure to use a slot acquired by trading a slot obtained in a 
lottery for a continuous 24-month period after the lottery, shall void 
all trades involving the lottery slot, which shall be returned to the 
FAA. All use of the lottery slot shall be counted toward fulfilling the 
minimum use requirements under Sec. 93.227(a) applicable to the slot or 
slots for which the lottery slot was traded, including subsequent 
trades.
    (iii) Slots obtained by new entrant or limited incumbent carriers in 
a lottery may be sold, leased, or otherwise transferred to another 
entrant or limited incumbent carrier after a minimum of 60

[[Page 343]]

days of use by the obtaining carrier. The transfer restrictions of Sec. 
93.221(a)(5)(i) shall continue to apply to the slot until documentation 
of 24 months' continuous use has been submitted and the transfer 
restriction removed.
    (6) The Office of the Secretary of Transportation must determine 
that the transfer will not be injurious to the essential air service 
program.
    (b) A record of each slot transfer shall be kept on file by the 
office specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and will be made 
available to the public upon request.
    (c) Any person may buy or sell slots and any air carrier or commuter 
may use them. Notwithstanding Sec. 93.123, air carrier slots may be 
used with aircraft of the kind described in Sec. 93.123 (c)(1) or 
(c)(2) but commuter slots may only be used with aircraft of the kind 
described in Sec. 93.0123(c)(2).
    (d) Air carriers and commuter operators considered to be a single 
operator under the provisions of Sec. 93.213(c) of this subpart but 
operating under separate names shall report transfers of slots between 
them.
    (e) Notwithstanding Sec. 93.123(c)(2) of this part, a commuter slot 
at O'Hare International Airport may be used with an aircraft described 
in Sec. 93.123(c)(1) of this part on the following conditions:
    (1) Air carrier aircraft that may be operated under this paragraph 
are limited to aircraft:
    (i) Having an actual seating configuration of 110 or fewer 
passengers; and
    (ii) Having a maximum certificated takeoff weight of less than 
126,000 pounds.
    (2) No more than 50 percent of the total number of commuter slots 
held by a slot holder at O'Hare International Airport may be used with 
aircraft described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (3) An air carrier or commuter operator planning to operate an 
aircraft described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section in a commuter 
slot shall notify ATC at least 75 days in advance of the planned start 
date of such operation. The notice shall include the slot number, 
proposed time of operation, aircraft type, aircraft series, actual 
aircraft seating configuration, and planned start date. ATC will approve 
or disapprove the proposed operation no later than 45 days prior to the 
planned start date. If an operator does not initiate operation of a 
commuter slot under this section within 30 days of the planned start 
date first submitted to the FAA, the ATC approval for that operation 
will expire. That operator may file a new or revised notice for the same 
half-hour slot time.
    (4) An operation may not be conducted under paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section unless a gate is available for that operation without planned 
waiting time.
    (5) For the purposes of this paragraph (e), notice to ATC shall be 
submitted in writing to: Director, Air Traffic System Management, ATM-1, 
Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue SW., 
Washington, DC 20591.

Sec. 93.223  Slot withdrawal.

    (a) Slots do not represent a property right but represent an 
operating privilege subject to absolute FAA control. Slots may be 
withdrawn at any time to fulfill the Department's operational needs, 
such as providing slots for international or essential air service 
operations or eliminating slots. Before withdrawing any slots under this 
section to provide them for international operations, essential air 
services or other operational needs, those slots returned under Sec. 
93.224 of this part and those recalled by the agency under Sec. 93.227 
will be allocated.
    (b) Separate slot pools shall be established for air carriers and 
commuter operators at each airport. The FAA shall assign, by random 
lottery, withdrawal priority numbers for the recall priority of slots at 
each airport. Each additional permanent slot, if any, will be assigned 
the next higher number for air carrier or commuter slots, as 
appropriate, at each airport. Each slot shall be assigned a designation 
consisting of the applicable withdrawal priority

[[Page 344]]

number; the airport code; a code indicating whether the slot is an air 
carrier or commuter operator slot; and the time period of the slot. The 
designation shall also indicate, as appropriate, if the slot is daily or 
for certain days of the week only; is limited to arrivals or departures; 
is allocated for international operations or for EAS purposes; and, at 
Kennedy International Airport, is a summer or winter slot.
    (c) Whenever slots must be withdrawn, they will be withdrawn in 
accordance with the priority list established under paragraph (b) of 
this section, except:
    (1) Slots obtained in a lottery held pursuant to Sec. 93.225 of 
this part shall be subject to withdrawal pursuant to paragraph (i) of 
that section, and
    (2) Slots necessary for international and essential air service 
operations shall be exempt from withdrawal for use for other 
international or essential air service operations.
    (3) Except as provided in Sec. 93.227(a), the FAA shall not 
withdraw slots held at an airport by an air carrier or commuter operator 
holding and operating 12 or fewer slots at that airport (excluding slots 
used for operations described in Sec. 93.212(a)(1)), if withdrawal 
would reduce the number of slots held below the number of slots 
operated.
    (4) No slot comprising the guaranteed base of slots, as defined in 
section 93.318(b), shall be withdrawn for use for international 
operations or for new entrants.
    (d) The following withdrawal priority rule shall be used to permit 
application of the one-for-one trade provisions for international and 
essential air service slots and the slot withdrawal provisions where the 
slots are needed for other than international or essential air service 
operations. If an operator has more than one slot in a specific time 
period in which it also has a slot being used for international or 
essential air service operations, the international and essential air 
service slots will be considered to be those with the lowest withdrawal 
priority.
    (e) The operator(s) using each slot to be withdrawn shall be 
notified by the FAA of the withdrawal and shall cease operations using 
that slot on the date indicated in the notice. Generally, the FAA will 
provide at least 30 days after notification for the operator to cease 
operations unless exigencies require a shorter time period.
    (f) For 24 months following a lottery held after June 1, 1991, a 
slot acquired in that lottery shall be withdrawn by the FAA upon the 
sale, merger, or acquisition of more than 50 percent ownership or 
control of the carrier using that slot or one acquired by trade of that 
slot, if the resulting total of slots held or operated at the airport by 
the surviving entity would exceed 12 slots.

available for distribution for purposes other than international or 
essential air service operations, but generally not more than twice a 
year, they shall be allocated in accordance with the provisions of this 
section.
    (b) A random lottery shall be held to determine the order of slot 
selection.
    (c) Slot allocation lotteries shall be held on an airport-by-airport 
basis with separate lotteries for air carrier and commuter operator 
slots. The slots to be allocated in each lottery will be each 
unallocated slot not necessary for international or Essential Air 
Service Program operations, including any slot created by an increase in 
the operating limits set forth in Sec. 93.123(a).
    (d) The FAA shall publish a notice in the Federal Register 
announcing any lottery dates. The notice may include special procedures 
to be in effect for the lotteries.

agreement. Any U.S. carrier, or foreign air carrier where provided for 
by bilateral agreement, that is not operating scheduled service at the 
airport and has not failed to operate slots obtained in the previous 
lottery, or slots traded for those obtained by lottery, but wishes to 
initiate scheduled passenger service at the airport, shall be included 
in the lottery if that operator notifies, in writing, the Slot 
Administration Office, AGC-230, Office of the Chief Counsel, Federal 
Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 
20591. The notification must be received 15 days prior to the lottery 
date and state whether there is any common ownership or control of, by, 
or with any other air carrier or commuter operator as defined in Sec. 
93.213(c). New entrant and limited incumbent carriers will be permitted 
to complete their selections before participation by other incumbent 
carriers is initiated.
    (f) At the lottery, each operator must make its selection within 5 
minutes after being called or it shall lose its turn. If capacity still 
remains after each operator has had an opportunity to select slots, the 
allocation sequence will be repeated in the same order. An operator may 
select any two slots available at the airport during each sequence, 
except that new entrant carriers may select four slots, if available, in 
the first sequence.
    (g) To select slots during a slot lottery session, a carrier must 
have appropriate economic authority for scheduled passenger service 
under Title IV of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (49 
U.S.C. App. 1371 et seq.), and must hold FAA operating authority under 
part 121 or part 135 of this chapter as appropriate for the slots the 
operator seeks to select.
    (h) During the first selection sequence, 25 percent of the slots 
available but no less than two slots shall be reserved for selection by 
new entrant carriers. If new entrant carriers do not select all of the 
slots set aside for new entrant carriers, limited incumbent carriers may 
select the remaining slots. If every participating new entrant carrier 
and limited incumbent carrier has ceased selection of available slots or 
has obtained 12 slots at that airport, other incumbent carriers may 
participate in selecting the remaining slots; however, slots selected by 
non-limited incumbent carriers will be allocated only until the date of 
the next lottery.
    (i) Slots obtained under this section shall retain their withdrawal 
priority as established under Sec. 93.223. If the slot is newly 
created, a withdrawal priority shall be assigned. That priority number 
shall be higher than any other slot assigned a withdrawal number 
previously.

Sec. 93.226  Allocation of slots in low-demand periods.

    (a) If there are available slots in the following time periods and 
there are no pending requests for international or EAS operations at 
these times, FAA will allocate slots upon request on a first-come, 
first-served basis, as set forth in this section:
    (1) Any period for which a slot is available less than 5 days per

operating authority and aircraft required to use the slots.
    (c) Requests for allocations under this section shall be submitted 
in writing to the address listed in Sec. 93.221(a)(1) and shall 
identify the request as made under this section.
    (d) The FAA may deny requests made under this section after a 
determination that all remaining slots in a particular category should 
be distributed by lottery.
    (e) Slots may be allocated on a seasonal or temporary basis under 
this provision.

Sec. 93.227  Slot use and loss.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (g), and (l) of 
this section, any slot not utilized 80 percent of the time over a 2-
month period shall be recalled by the FAA.
    (b) Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to slots obtained 
under Sec. 93.225 of this part during:
    (1) The first 90 days after they are allocated to a new entrant 
carrier; or
    (2) The first 60 days after they are allocated to a limited 
incumbent or other incumbent carrier.
    (c) Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to slots of an 
operator forced by a strike to cease operations using those slots.
    (d) In the case of a carrier that files for protection under the 
Federal bankruptcy laws and has not received a Notice of Withdrawal from 
the FAA for the subject slot or slots, paragraph (a) of this section 
does not apply:
    (1) During a period after the initial petition in bankruptcy, to any 
slot held or operated by that carrier, for:
    (i) 60 days after the carrier files the initial petition in 
bankruptcy; and
    (ii) 30 days after the carrier, in anticipation of transferring 
slots, submits information to a Federal government agency in connection 
with a statutory antitrust, economic impact, or similar review of the 
transfer, provided that the information is submitted more than 30 days 
after filing the initial petition in bankruptcy, and provided further 
that any slot to be transferred has not become subject to withdrawal 
under any other provision of this Sec. 93.227; and
    (2) During a period after a carrier ceases operations at an airport, 
to any slot held or operated by that carrier at that airport, for:
    (i) 30 days after the carrier ceases operations at that airport, 
provided that the slot has not become subject to withdrawal under any 
other provision of this Sec. 93.227; and
    (ii) 30 days after the parties to a proposed transfer of any such 
slot comply with requests for additional information by a Federal 
government agency in connection with an antitrust, economic impact, or 
similar investigation of the transfer, provided that--
    (A) The original notice of the transfer is filed with the Federal 
agency within 30 days after the carrier ceases operation at the airport;
    (B) The request for additional information is made within 10 days of 
the filing of the notice by the carrier;
    (C) The carrier submits the additional information to the Federal 
agency within 15 days of the request by such agency; and
    (D) Any slot to be transferred has not become subject to withdrawal 
under any other provision of this Sec. 93.227.
    (e) Persons having slots withdrawn pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section must cease all use of those slots upon receipt of notice from 
the FAA.
    (f) Persons holding slots but not using them pursuant to the 
provisions of paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) may lease those slots for use 
by others. A slot obtained in a lottery may not be leased after the 
expiration of the applicable time period specified in paragraph (b) of 
this section unless it has been operated for a 2-month period at least 
65 percent of the time by the operator which obtained it in the lottery.
    (g) This section does not apply to slots used for the operations 
described in Sec. 93.217(a)(1) except that a U.S. air carrier or 
commuter operator required to file a report under paragraph (i) of this 
section shall include all slots operated at the airport, including slots 
described in Sec. 93.217(a)(1).
    (h) Within 30 days after an operator files for protection under the 
Federal bankruptcy laws, the FAA shall recall any slots of that 
operator, if--(1) the slots were formerly used for essential air service 
and (2) the Office of the Secretary of Transportation determines those 
slots are required to provide substitute essential air service to or 
from the same points.
    (i) Every air carrier and commuter operator or other person holding 
a slot at a high density airport shall, within 14 days after the last 
day of the 2-month period beginning January 1, 1986, and every 2 months 
thereafter, forward, in writing, to the address identified in Sec. 
93.221(a)(1), a list of all slots held by the air carrier, commuter 
operator or other person along with a listing of which air carrier or 
commuter operator actually operated the

[[Page 347]]

slot for each day of the 2-month period. The report shall identify the 
flight number for which the slot was used and the equipment used, and 
shall identify the flight as an arrival or departure. The report shall 
identify any common ownership or control of, by, or with any other 
carrier as defined in Sec. 93.213(c) of this subpart. The report shall 
be signed by a senior official of the air carrier or commuter operator. 
If the slot is held by an ``other person,'' the report must be signed by 
an official representative.
    (j) The Chief Counsel of the FAA may waive the requirements of 
paragraph (a) of this section in the event of a highly unusual and 
unpredictable condition which is beyond the control of the slot-holder 
and which exists for a period of 9 or more days. Examples of conditions 
which could justify waiver under this paragraph are weather conditions 
which result in the restricted operation of an airport for an extended 
period of time or the grounding of an aircraft type.
    (k) The Chief Counsel of the FAA may, upon request, grant a waiver 
from the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section for a slot used 
for the domestic segment of an intercontinental all-cargo flight. To 
qualify for a waiver, a carrier must operate the slot a substantial 
percentage of the time and must return the slot to the FAA in advance 
for the time periods it will not be used.
    (l) The FAA will treat as used any slot held by a carrier at a High 
Density Traffic Airport on Thanksgiving Day, the Friday following 
Thanksgiving Day, and the period from December 24 through the first 
Saturday in January.

Sec. 95.1  Applicability.

    (a) This part prescribes altitudes governing the operation of 
aircraft under IFR on ATS routes, or other direct routes for which an 
MEA is designated in this part. In addition, it designates mountainous 
areas and changeover points.
    (b) The MAA is the highest altitude on an ATS route, or other direct 
route for which an MEA is designated, at which adequate reception of VOR 
signals is assured.
    (c) The MCA applies to the operation of an aircraft proceeding to a 
higher minimum en route altitude when crossing specified fixes.
    (d) The MEA is the minimum en route IFR altitude on an ATS route, 
ATS route segment, or other direct route. The MEA applies to the entire 
width of the ATS route, ATS route segment, or other direct route between 
fixes defining that route. Unless otherwise specified, an MEA prescribed 
for an off airway route or route segment applies to the airspace 4 
nautical miles on each side of a direct course between the navigation 
fixes defining that route or route segment.
    (e) The MOCA assures obstruction clearance on an ATS route, ATS 
route segment, or other direct route, and adequate reception of VOR 
navigation signals within 22 nautical miles of a VOR station used to 
define the route.
    (f) The MRA applies to the operation of an aircraft over an 
intersection defined by ground-based navigation aids. The MRA is the 
lowest altitude at which the intersection can be determined using the 
ground-based navigation aids.
    (g) The changeover point (COP) applies to operation of an aircraft 
along a Federal airway, jet route, or other direct route; for which an 
MEA is designated in this part. It is the point for transfer of the 
airborne navigation reference from the ground-based navigation aid 
behind the aircraft to the next appropriate ground-based navigation aid 
to ensure continuous reception of signals.

<R05>
Sec. 97.1  Applicability.

    This part prescribes standard instrument approach procedures for 
instrument letdown to airports in the United States and the weather 
minimums that apply to takeoffs and landings under IFR at those 
airports.


<R05>
Sec. 97.3  Symbols and terms used in procedures.

    As used in the standard terminal instrument procedures prescribed in 
this part--
    (a) A means alternate airport weather minimum.
    (b) Aircraft approach category means a grouping of aircraft based on 
a speed of V<INF>REF</INF>, if specified, or if V<INF>REF</INF> is not 
specified, 1.3 V<INF>S0</INF> at the maximum certificated landing 
weight. V<INF>REF</INF>, V<INF>S0</INF>, and the maximum certificated 
landing weight are those values as established for the aircraft by the 
certification authority of the country of registry. The categories are 
as follows:
    (1) Category A: Speed less than 91 knots.
    (2) Category B: Speed 91 knots or more but less than 121 knots.
    (3) Category C: Speed 121 knots or more but less than 141 knots.
    (4) Category D: Speed 141 knots or more but less than 166 knots.
    (5) Category E: Speed 166 knots or more.
    (c) Approach procedure segments for which altitudes (all altitudes 
prescribed are minimum altitudes unless otherwise specified) or courses, 
or both, are prescribed in procedures, are as follows:
    (1) Initial approach is the segment between the intial approach fix 
and the intermediate fix or the point where the

[[Page 363]]

aircraft is established on the intermediate course or final approach 
course.
    (2) Initial approach altitude means the altitude (or altitudes, in 
High Altitude Procedures) prescribed for the initial approach segment of 
an instrument approach.
    (3) Intermediate approach is the segment between the intermediate 
fix or point and the final approach fix.
    (4) Final approach is the segment between the final approach fix or 
point and the runway, airport, or missed-approach point.
    (5) Missed approach is the segment between the missed-approach 
point, or point of arrival at decision height, and the missed-approach 
fix at the prescribed altitude.
    (d) C means circling landing minimum, a statement of ceiling and 
visibility values, or minimum descent altitude and visibility, required 
for the circle-to-land maneuver.
    (d-1) Copter procedures means helicopter procedures, with applicable 
minimums as prescribed in Sec. 97.35 of this part. Helicopters may also 
use other procedures prescribed in Subpart C of this part and may use 
the Category A minimum descent altitude (MDA) or decision height (DH). 
The required visibility minimum may be reduced to one-half the published 
visibility minimum for Category A aircraft, but in no case may it be 
reduced to less than one-quarter mile or 1,200 feet RVR.
    (e) Ceiling minimum means the minimum ceiling, expressed in feet 
above the surface of the airport, required for takeoff or required for 
designating an airport as an alternate airport.
    (f) D means day.
    (g) FAF means final approach fix.
    (h) HAA means height above airport.
    (h-1) HAL means height above a designated helicopter landing area 
used for helicopter instrument approach procedures.
    (i) HAT means height above touchdown.
    (j) MAP means missed approach point.
    (k) More than 65 knots means an aircraft that has a stalling speed 
of more than 65 knots (as established in an approved flight manual) at 
maximum certificated landing weight with full flaps, landing gear 
extended, and power off.
    (l) MSA means minimum safe altitude, an emergency altitude expressed 
in feet above mean sea level, which provides 1,000 feet clearance over 
all obstructions in that sector within 25 miles of the facility on which 
the procedure is based (LOM in ILS procedures).
    (m) N means night.
    (n) NA means not authorized.
    (o) NOPT means no procedure turn required (altitude prescribed 
applies only if procedure turn is not executed).
    (o-1) Point in space approach means a helicopter instrument approach 
procedure to a missed approach point that is more than 2,600 feet from 
an associated helicopter landing area.
    (p) Procedure turn means the maneuver prescribed when it is 
necessary to reverse direction to establish the aircraft on an 
intermediate or final approach course. The outbound course, direction of 
turn, distance within which the turn must be completed, and minimum 
altitude are specified in the procedure. However, the point at which the 
turn may be commenced, and the type and rate of turn, is left to the 
discretion of the pilot.
    (q) RA means radio altimeter setting height.
    (r) RVV means runway visibility value.
    (s) S means straight-in landing minimum, a statement of ceiling and 
visibility, minimum descent altitude and visibility, or decision height 
and visibility, required for a straight-in landing on a specified 
runway. The number appearing with the S indicates the runway to which 
the minimum applies. If a straight-in minimum is not prescribed in the 
procedure, the circling minimum specified applies to a straight-in 
landing.
    (t) Shuttle means a shuttle, or race-track-type, pattern with 2-
minute legs prescribed in lieu of a procedure turn.
    (u) 65 knots or less means an aircraft that has a stalling speed of 
65 knots or less (as established in an approved flight manual) at 
maximum certificated landing weight with full flaps, landing gear 
extended, and power off.
    (v) T means takeoff minimum.
    (w) TDZ means touchdown zone.

[[Page 364]]

    (x) Visibility minimum means the minimum visibility specified for 
approach, or landing, or takeoff, expressed in statute miles, or in feet 
where RVR is reported.

    Aeronautical facility means, for the purposes of this subpart, a 
communications facility where flight plans or position reports are 
normally filed during flight operations.
    Air defense identification zone (ADIZ) means an area of airspace 
over land or water in which the ready identification, location, and 
control of all aircraft (except for Department of Defense and law 
enforcement aircraft) is required in the interest of national security.
    Defense area means any airspace of the contiguous United States that 
is not an ADIZ in which the control of aircraft is required for reasons 
of national security.
    Defense visual flight rules (DVFR) means, for the purposes of this 
subpart, a flight within an ADIZ conducted by any aircraft (except for 
Department of Defense and law enforcement aircraft) in accordance with

point of ADIZ penetration, and
    (2) The aircraft departs within five minutes of the estimated 
departure time contained in the flight plan.
    (c) If the pilot operating an aircraft under DVFR in an ADIZ cannot 
maintain two-way radio communications, the pilot may proceed, in 
accordance with original DVFR flight plan, or land as soon as 
practicable. The pilot must report the radio failure to an appropriate 
aeronautical facility as soon as possible.
    (d) If a pilot operating an aircraft under IFR in an ADIZ cannot 
maintain two-way radio communications, the pilot must proceed in 
accordance with Sec. 91.185 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 99.11  ADIZ flight plan requirements.

    (a) No person may operate an aircraft into, within, or from a 
departure point within an ADIZ, unless the person files, activates, and 
closes a flight plan with the appropriate aeronautical facility, or is 
otherwise authorized by air traffic control.

[[Page 367]]

    (b) Unless ATC authorizes an abbreviated flight plan--
    (1) A flight plan for IFR flight must contain the information 
specified in Sec. 91.169; and
    (2) A flight plan for VFR flight must contain the information 
specified in Sec. 91.153(a) (1) through (6).
    (3) If airport of departure is within the Alaskan ADIZ and there is 
no facility for filing a flight plan then:
    (i) Immediately after takeoff or when within range of an appropriate 
aeronautical facility, comply with provisions of paragraph (b)(1) or 
(b)(2) as appropriate.
    (ii) Proceed according to the instructions issued by the appropriate 
aeronautical facility.
    (c) The pilot shall designate a flight plan for VFR flight as a DVFR 
flight plan.
    (d) The pilot in command of an aircraft for which a flight plan has 
been filed must file an arrival or completion notice with an appropriate 
aeronautical facility.

aircraft into or out of the United States into, within, or across an 
ADIZ designated in subpart B of this part, if that aircraft is equipped 
with an operable radar beacon transponder, shall operate the 
transponder, including altitude encoding equipment if installed, and 
shall reply on the appropriate code or as assigned by ATC.
    (b) ATC transponder equipment and use. Effective September 7, 1990, 
unless otherwise authorized by ATC, no person may operate a civil 
aircraft into or out of the United States into, within, or across the 
contiguous U.S. ADIZ designated in subpart B of this part unless that 
aircraft is equipped with a coded radar beacon transponder.
    (c) ATC transponder and altitude reporting equipment and use. 
Effective December 30, 1990, unless otherwise authorized by ATC, no

               Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 14

    Contrary performance provisions of the Civil Air Regulations 
notwithstanding, the Administrator may grant performance credit for the 
use of standby power on transport category airplanes. Such credit shall 
be applicable only to the maximum certificated take-off and landing 
weights, and the take-off distance, and the take-off paths, and shall 
not exceed that found by the Administrator to result in an over-all 
level of safety in the take-off, approach, and landing regimes of flight 
equivalent to that prescribed in the regulations under which the 
airplane was originally certificated without standby power. (Note: 
Standby power is power and/or thrust obtained from rocket engines for a 
relatively short period and actuated only in cases of emergency.) The 
following provisions shall apply:
    (1) Take-off; general. The take-off data prescribed in sections (2) 
and (3) shall be determined at all weights and altitudes, and at ambient 
temperatures if applicable, at which performance credit is to be 
applied.
    (2) Take-off path. (a) The one-engine-inoperative take-off path with 
standby power in use shall be determined in accordance with the 
performance requirements of the applicable airworthiness regulations.
    (b) The one-engine-inoperative take-off path (excluding that portion 
where the airplane is on or just above the take-off surface-determined 
in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section shall lie above the 
one/engine-inoperative take-off path without standby power at the 
maximum take/off weight at which all of the applicable airworthiness 
requirements are met. For the purpose of this comparison, the flight 
path shall be considered to extend to at least a height of 400 feet 
above the take-off surface.
    (c) The take-off path with all engines operating, but without the 
use of standby power, shall reflect a conservatively greater over-all 
level of performance than the one-engine-inoperative take-off path 
established in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. The 
aforementioned margin shall be established by the Administrator to 
insure safe day-to-day operations, but in no case shall it be less than 
15 percent. The all-engines-operating take-off path shall be determined 
by a procedure consistent with that established in complying with 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) For reciprocating-engine-powered airplanes, the take-off path to 
be scheduled in the Airplane Flight Manual shall represent the one-
engine-inoperative take-off path determined in accordance with paragraph 
(a) of this section and modified to reflect the procedure (see section 
(6)) established by the applicant for flap retraction and attainment of 
the en route speed. The scheduled take-off path shall have a positive 
slope at all points

[[Page 410]]

of the airborne portion and at no point shall it lie above the take-off 
path specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (3) Take-off distance. The take-off distance shall be the horizontal 
distance along the one/engine-inoperative take-off to the point where 
the airplane attains a height of 50 feet aove the take-off surface for 
reciprocating-engine-powered airplanes and a height of 35 feet above the 
take-off surface for turbine-powered airplanes.
    (4) Maximum certificated take-off weights. The maximum certificated 
take-off weights shall be determined at all altitudes, and at ambient 
temperatures if applicable, at which performance credit is to be applied 
and shall not exceed the weights established in compliance with 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (a) The conditions of section (2) (b) through (d) shall be met at 
the maximum certificated take-off weight.
    (b) Without the use of standby power, the airplane shall meet all of 
the en route requirements of the applicable airworthiness regulations 
under which the airplane was originally certificated. In addition, 
turbine-powered airplanes without the use of standby power shall meet 
the final take-off climb requirements prescribed in the applicable 
airworthiness regulations.
    (5) Maximum certificated landing weights. (a) The maximum 
certificated landing weights (one-engine/inoperative approach and all-
engine/operating landing climb) shall be determined at all altitudes, 
and at ambient temperatures if applicable, at which performance credit 
is to be applied and shall not exceed that established in compliance 
with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.

during operationally (line) oriented flights, such as ferry flights or 
proving flights. An online evaluation in an aircraft must be completed 
in the calendar month that includes the midpoint of the evaluation 
period. An online evaluation that is satisfactorily completed in the 
calendar month before or the calendar month after the calendar month in 
which it becomes due is considered to have been completed during the 
calendar month it became due. However, in no case is an online 
evaluation under this

[[Page 415]]

paragraph required more often than once during an evaluation period.
    (B) During the online evaluations required under paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, each person performing duties as a pilot 
in command, second in command, or flight engineer for that flight, must

particular aircraft, crew position, and type of operation in which he or 
she serves; and (2) Has sufficient knowledge and skills to operate 
effectively as part of a crew.
    (4) Recency of experience. For pilots in command and seconds in 
command, and, if the certificate holder elects, flight engineers and 
aircraft dispatchers, approved recency of experience requirements.
    (c) Duration periods. Initially the continuing qualification cycle 
approved for an AQP may not exceed 26 calendar months and the evaluation 
period may not exceed 13 calendar months. Thereafter, upon demonstration 
by a certificate holder that an extension is warranted, the 
Administrator may approve extensions of the continuing qualification 
cycle and the evaluation period in increments not exceeding 3 calendar 
months. However, a continuing qualification cycle may not exceed 39 
calendar months and an evaluation period may not exceed 26 calendar 
months.

 Special Federal Aviation Regulation 80--Alternative Communications and 
                         Dispatching Procedures

    1. Applicability. This Special Federal Aviation Regulation applies 
to each holder of an air carrier or operating certificate (hereafter, 
certificate holder) that meets one of the following eligibility 
requirements:
    a. The certificate holder conducts scheduled operations with 
airplanes having a passenger-seat configuration of 30 seats or fewer, 
excluding each crewmember seat, and a payload capacity of 7,500 pounds 
or less under part 121 of this chapter.
    b. The certificate holder conducts domestic operations in Alaska 
under part 121 of this chapter.
    2. Alternative requirements.
    a. If an operator described in paragraph 1.a. of this SFAR is 
conducting a flight with an airplane described in 1.a. and if 
communications cannot be maintained over the entire route (which would 
be contrary to the requirements of Sec. 121.99 of this chapter), such 
an operator may continue to operate over such a route subject to 
approval by the Administrator. In granting such approval the 
Administrator considers the following:
    i. The operator has an established dispatch communication system.
    ii. Gaps in communication are not over the entire route, but only 
over portions of the route.
    iii. When communication gaps occur, they occur due to one or more of 
the following:
    A. Lack of infrastructure.
    B. Geographical considerations.
    C. Assigned operating altitude.
    iv. Procedures are established for the prompt re-establishment of 
communications.
    v. The operator has presented a plan or schedule for coming into 
compliance with the requirements in Sec. 121.99 of this chapter.
    b. A certificate holder who conducts domestic operations in Alaska 
may, notwithstanding the requirements of Sec. 121.99 of this chapter, 
use a communications system operated by the United States for those 
operations.
    c. An operator described in paragraph 1.a. of this SFAR who conducts 
operations in Alaska may share the aircraft dispatcher required by Sec. 
121.395 with another operator described in paragraph 1.a. of this SFAR 
who conducts operations in Alaska if authorized to do so by the 
Administrator. Before granting such an authorization, the Administrator 
considers:
    i. The operators' joint plans for complying with the aircraft 
dispatcher training rules in subpart N of part 121 of this chapter and 
the aircraft dispatcher qualification and duty time limitation rules in 
subpart P of part 121 of this chapter.
    ii. The number of flights for which the aircraft dispatcher would be 
responsible.
    iii. Whether the responsibilities of the dispatcher would be beyond 
the capability of a single dispatcher.
    3. Expiration. This Special Federal Aviation Regulation terminates 
on March 12, 2001, unless sooner terminated.

Special Federal Aviation Regulation 92-5--Flightcrew Compartment Access 
                            and Door Designs

    1. Applicability. This Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) 
applies to all operators that hold an air carrier certificate or 
operating certificate issued under 14 CFR part 119 and that conduct 
operations under this part 121 and to operators of U.S. registered 
transport category airplanes operated under 14 CFR part 129, except 
paragraph 5 of this SFAR does not apply to cargo operations and 14 CFR 
part 129 operations. It applies to the operators specified in this SFAR 
that modify airplanes to improve the flightcrew compartment door 
installations

[[Page 418]]

to restrict the unwanted entry of persons into the flightcrew 
compartment. This SFAR also applies to production certificate holders 
and applicants for airworthiness certificates for airplanes to be 
operated by operators specified in this SFAR, and producers of parts to 
be used in modifications of such airplanes.
    2. Regulatory Relief. Contrary provisions of this part 21, and 
Sec. Sec. 121.313(h), 121.153(a)(2), 121.153(c), 121.379(b), 
121.583(b)(1) and (2) and 14 CFR 129.13 notwithstanding:
    (a) An operator may operate airplanes modified to improve the 
flightcrew compartment door installations to restrict the unauthorized 
entry of persons into the flightcrew compartment without regard to the 
applicable airworthiness requirements and may modify those airplanes for 
that purpose, using technical data not previously approved by the 
Administrator, subject to the following conditions:
    (i) Not later than February 15, 2002, submit to the Director, 
Aircraft Certification Service, a detailed description of the changes to 
the airplane that have been accomplished before that date to enhance the 
intrusion resistance of the flightcrew compartment including 
identification of what major alterations have been done without 
previously approved data.
    (ii) If, upon reviewing the data submitted in paragraph 2(a)(i) of 
this SFAR, the Administrator determines that a door modification 
presents an unacceptable safety risk, the FAA may issue an order 
requiring changes to such modifications.
    (b) An applicant for an airworthiness certificate may obtain such a 
certificate for modified airplanes to be operated by operators described 
in this SFAR.
    (c) A holder of a production certificate may submit for 
airworthiness certification or approval, modified airplanes to be 
operated by operators described in this SFAR.
    (d) A person may produce parts for installation on airplanes in 
connection with modifications described in this SFAR, without FAA parts 
manufacturer approval (PMA).
    3. Report of Modifications. Not later than April 22, 2002, all 
operators who are required to install flightdeck door modifications in 
accordance with 14 CFR 121.313(j) must submit a report to the Director, 
Aircraft Certification Service. The report must describe the 
modifications to be made and provide a schedule for the changes 
necessary to restore compliance with all applicable airworthiness 
requirements and to meet the requirements of 14 CFR 121.313(j). The 
schedule may not extend beyond the termination date of this SFAR.
    4. Return to Service Documentation. Where operators have modified 
airplanes as authorized in this SFAR, the affected airplane must be 
returned to service with a note that it was done under the provisions of 
this SFAR.
    5. Provision for Flightdeck Door Compartment Key. Contrary to 
provisions of Sec. 121.313(g), the following provision applies: A key 
for each door that separates a passenger compartment from an emergency 
exit must be identified to passengers in the briefing required by Sec. 
121.571(a)(1)(ii). The key required for access to the emergency exit 
must be readily available for each crewmember. No key to the flightcrew 
compartment shall be available to any crewmember during flight, except 
for flight crewmembers, unless an internal flightdeck locking device 
such as a deadbolt or bar is installed, operative, and in use.
    6. Door Modification Requirement. After March 1, 2002, for each 
airplane required under Sec. 121.313(f) to have a door between the 
passenger and pilot compartments, and for transport category all-cargo 
airplanes that have a door installed between the pilot compartment and 
any other occupied compartment on or after January 15, 2002, such door 
must be equipped with an internal locking device installed, operative, 
and in use. Such internal locking device has to be designed so that it 
can only be unlocked from inside the flightdeck.
    7. Termination. For all-cargo transport category airplanes, this 
SFAR terminates on October 1, 2003. For passenger airplanes, this SFAR 
expires on April 9, 2003, except for airplanes meeting the criteria 
specified in paragraphs 7.a, b, and c, below. For airplanes meeting 
these criteria, this SFAR expires on July 31, 2003.
    a. Before midnight April 9, 2003, the operator must have installed a 
strengthened flightdeck door meeting the requirement of paragraph 7.b;
    b. Before midnight April 9, 2003, the FAA must have found that the 
door complies with 14 CFR 25.795(a)(1) and (2) in effect on January 15, 
2002; and
    c. Before March 10, 2003, a formal application for certification 
approval of the door must have been submitted to the FAA.

Sec. 121.163  Aircraft proving tests.

    (a) Initial airplane proving tests. No person may operate an 
airplane not before proven for use in a kind of operation under this 
part or part 135 of this chapter unless an airplane of that type has 
had, in addition to the airplane certification tests, at least 100 hours 
of proving tests acceptable to the Administrator, including a 
representative number of flights into en route airports. The requirement 
for at least 100 hours of proving tests may be reduced by the 
Administrator if the Administrator determines that a satisfactory level 
of proficiency has been demonstrated to justify the reduction. At least 
10 hours of proving flights must be flown at night; these tests are 
irreducible.
    (b) Proving tests for kinds of operations. Unless otherwise 
authorized by the Administrator, for each type of airplane, a 
certificate holder must conduct at least 50 hours of proving tests 
acceptable to the Administrator for each kind of operation it intends to 
conduct, including a representative number of flights into en route 
airports.
    (c) Proving tests for materially altered airplanes. Unless otherwise 
authorized by the Administrator, for each type of airplane that is 
materially altered in design, a certificate holder must conduct at least 
50 hours of proving tests acceptable to the Administrator for each kind 
of operation it intends to conduct with that airplane, including a 
representative number of flights into en route airports.
    (d) Definition of materially altered. For the purposes of paragraph 
(c) of this section, a type of airplane is considered to be materially 
altered in design if the alteration includes--
    (1) The installation of powerplants other than those of a type 
similar to those with which it is certificated; or
    (2) Alterations to the aircraft or its components that materially 
affect flight characteristics.
    (e) No certificate holder may carry passengers in an aircraft during 
proving tests, except for those needed to make the test and those 
designated by the Administrator. However, it may carry mail, express, or 
other cargo, when approved.

<R05>
Sec. 121.171  Applicability.

    (a) This subpart prescribes airplane performance operating 
limitations for all certificate holders.
    (b) For purposes of this part, effective length of the runway for 
landing means the distance from the point at which the obstruction 
clearance plane associated with the approach end of the runway 
intersects the centerline of the runway to the far end thereof.
    (c) For the purposes of this subpart, obstruction clearance plane 
means a plane sloping upward from the runway at a slope of 1:20 to the 
horizontal, and tangent to or clearing all obstructions within a 
specified area surrounding the runway as shown in a profile view of that 
area. In the plan view, the centerline of the specified area coincides 
with the centerline of the runway, beginning at the point where the 
obstruction clearance plane intersects the centerline of the runway and 
proceeding to a point at least 1,500 feet from the beginning point. 
Thereafter the centerline coincides with the takeoff path over the 
ground for the runway (in the case of takeoffs) or with the instrument 
approach counterpart (for landings), or, where the applicable one of 
these paths has not been established, it proceeds consistent with turns 
of at least 4,000 foot radius until a point is reached beyond which the 
obstruction clearance plane clears all obstructions. This area extends 
laterally 200 feet on each side of the centerline at the point where the 
obstruction clearance plane intersects the runway and continues at this 
width to the end of the runway; then it increases uniformly to 500 feet 
on each side of the centerline at a point 1,500 feet from the 
intersection of the obstruction clearance plane with the runway; 
thereafter it extends laterally 500 feet on each side of the centerline.

Sec. 121.173  General.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, each 
certificate holder operating a reciprocating-engine-powered airplane 
shall comply with Sec. Sec. 121.175 through 121.187.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, each 
certificate holder operating a turbine-engine-powered airplane shall 
comply with the applicable provisions of Sec. Sec. 121.189 through 
121.197, except that when it operates--
    (1) A turbo-propeller-powered airplane type certificated after 
August 29, 1959, but previously type certificated with the same number 
of reciprocating engines, the certificate holder may comply with 
Sec. Sec. 121.175 through 121.187; or
    (2) Until December 20, 2010, a turbo-propeller-powered airplane 
described in Sec. 121.157(f), the certificate holder may comply with 
the applicable performance requirements of appendix K of this part.
    (c) Each certificate holder operating a large nontransport category 
airplane type certificated before January 1, 1965, shall comply with 
Sec. Sec. 121.199 through 121.205 and any determination of compliance 
must be based only on approved performance data.
    (d) The performance data in the Airplane Flight Manual applies in 
determining compliance with Sec. Sec. 121.175 through 121.197. Where 
conditions are different from those on which the performance data is 
based, compliance is determined by interpolation or by computing the 
effects of changes in the specific variables if the results of the 
interpolation or computations are substantially as accurate as the 
results of direct tests.
    (e) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, no person 
may take off a reciprocating-engine-powered airplane at a weight that is 
more than the allowable weight for the runway being used (determined 
under the runway takeoff limitations of the operating rules of 14 CFR 
part 121, subpart I) after taking into account the temperature operating 
correction factors in the applicable Airplane Flight Manual.
    (f) The Administrator may authorize in the operations specifications 
deviations from the requirements in the subpart if special circumstances 
make a literal observance of a requirement unnecessary for safety.
    (g) The ten-mile width specified in Sec. Sec. 121.179 through 
121.183 may be reduced to five miles, for not more than 20 miles, when 
operating VFR or where

[[Page 434]]

navigation facilities furnish reliable and accurate identification of 
high ground and obstructions located outside of five miles, but within 
ten miles, on each side of the intended track.

Sec. 121.175  Airplanes: Reciprocating engine-powered: Weight limitations.

    (a) No person may take off a reciprocating engine powered airplane 
from an airport located at an elevation outside of the range for which 
maximum takeoff weights have been determined for that airplane.
    (b) No person may take off a reciprocating engine powered airplane 
for an airport of intended destination that is located at an elevation 
outside of the range for which maximum landing weights have been 
determined for that airplane.
    (c) No person may specify, or have specified, an alternate airport 
that is located at an elevation outside of the range for which maximum 
landing weights have been determined for the reciprocating engine 
powered airplane concerned.
    (d) No person may take off a reciprocating engine powered airplane 
at a weight more than the maximum authorized takeoff weight for the 
elevation of the airport.
    (e) No person may take off a reciprocating engine powered airplane 
if its weight on arrival at the airport of destination will be more than 
the maximum authorized landing weight for the elevation of that airport, 
allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil en route.
    (f) This section does not apply to large nontransport category 
airplanes operated under Sec. 121.173(c).

<R05>
Sec. 121.177  Airplanes: Reciprocating engine-powered: Takeoff limitations.

    (a) No person operating a reciprocating engine powered airplane may 
takeoff that airplane unless it is possible--
    (1) To stop the airplane safely on the runway, as shown by the 
accelerate stop distance data, at any time during takeoff until reaching 
critical-engine failure speed;
    (2) If the critical engine fails at any time after the airplane 
reaches critical-engine failure speed V<INF>1</INF>, to continue the 
takeoff and reach a height of 50 feet, as indicated by the takeoff path 
data, before passing over the end of the runway; and
    (3) To clear all obstacles either by at least 50 feet vertically (as 
shown by the takeoff path data) or 200 feet horizontally within the 
airport boundaries and 300 feet horizontally beyond the boundaries, 
without banking before reaching a height of 50 feet (as shown by the 
takeoff path data) and thereafter without banking more than 15 degrees.
    (b) In applying this section, corrections must be made for the 
effective runway gradient. To allow for wind effect, takeoff data based 
on still air may be corrected by taking into account not more than 50 
percent of any reported headwind component and not less than 150 percent 
of any reported tailwind component.
    (c) This section does not apply to large nontransport category 
airplanes operated under Sec. 121.173(c).

person may, under an approved procedure, operate a reciprocating engine 
powered airplane, at an all-engines-operating altitude that allows the 
airplane to continue, after an engine failure, to an alternate airport 
where a landing can be made in accordance with Sec. 121.187, allowing 
for normal consumption of fuel and oil. After the assumed failure, the 
flight path must clear the ground and any obstruction within five miles 
on each side of the intended track by at least 2,000 feet.
    (c) If an approved procedure under paragraph (b) of this section is 
used, the certificate holder shall comply with the following:
    (1) The rate of climb (as prescribed in the Airplane Flight Manual 
for the appropriate weight and altitude) used in calculating the 
airplane's flight path shall be diminished by an amount, in feet per 
minute, equal to

(0.079-0.106/N) V<INF>so</INF>2


(when N is the number of engines installed and VS<INF>o</INF> is 
expressed in knots) for airplanes certificated under part 25 of this 
chapter and by 0.026 Vso2 for airplanes certificated under part 4a of 
the Civil Air Regulations.
    (2) The all-engines-operating altitude shall be sufficient so that 
in the event the critical engine becomes inoperative at any point along 
the route, the flight will be able to proceed to a predetermined 
alternate airport by use of this procedure. In determining the takeoff 
weight, the airplane is assumed to pass over the critical obstruction 
following engine failure at a point no closer to the critical 
obstruction than the nearest approved radio navigational fix, unless the 
Administrator approves a procedure established on a different basis upon 
finding that adequate operational safeguards exist.
    (3) The airplane must meet the provisions of paragraph (a) of this 
section at 1,000 feet above the airport used as an alternate in this 
procedure.
    (4) The procedure must include an approved method of accounting for 
winds and temperatures that would otherwise adversely affect the flight 
path.
    (5) In complying with this procedure fuel jettisoning is allowed if 
the certificate holder shows that it has an adequate training program, 
that proper instructions are given to the flight crew, and all other 
precautions are taken to insure a safe procedure.
    (6) The certificate holder shall specify in the dispatch or flight 
release an alternate airport that meets the requirements of Sec. 
121.625.
    (d) This section does not apply to large nontransport category 
airplanes operated under Sec. 121.173(c).

Sec. 121.183  Part 25 airplanes with four or more engines: Reciprocating 
engine powered: En route limitations: Two engines inoperative.

    (a) No person may operate an airplane certificated under part 25 and 
having four or more engines unless--
    (1) There is no place along the intended track that is more than 90 
minutes (with all engines operating at cruising power) from an airport 
that meets the requirements of Sec. 121.187; or

[[Page 436]]

    (2) It is operated at a weight allowing the airplane, with the two 
critical engines inoperative, to climb at 0.013 V<INF>so</INF>2 feet per 
minute (that is, the number of feet per minute is obtained by 
multiplying the number of knots squared by 0.013) at an altitude of 
1,000 feet above the highest ground or obstruction within 10 miles on 
each side of the intended track, or at an altitude of 5,000 feet, 
whichever is higher.
    (b) For the purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it is 
assumed that--
    (1) The two engines fail at the point that is most critical with 
respect to the takeoff weight:
    (2) Consumption of fuel and oil is normal with all engines operating 
up to the point where the two engines fail and with two engines 
operating beyond that point;
    (3) Where the engines are assumed to fail at an altitude above the 
prescribed minimum altitude, compliance with the prescribed rate of 
climb at the prescribed minimum altitude need not be shown during the 
descent from the cruising altitude to the prescribed minimum altitude, 
if those requirements can be met once the prescribed minimum altitude is 
reached, and assuming descent to be along a net flight path and the rate 
of descent to be 0.013 V<INF>so</INF>2 greater than the rate in the 
approved performance data; and
    (4) If fuel jettisoning is provided, the airplane's weight at the 
point where the two engines fail is considered to be not less than that 
which would include enough fuel to proceed to an airport meeting the 
requirements of Sec. 121.187 and to arrive at an altitude of at least 
1,000 feet directly over that airport.

Sec. 121.185  Airplanes: Reciprocating engine-powered: Landing limitations: 
Destination airport.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section no person 
operating a reciprocating engine powered airplane may take off that 
airplane, unless its weight on arrival, allowing for normal consumption 
of fuel and oil in flight, would allow a full stop landing at the 
intended destination within 60 percent of the effective length of each 
runway described below from a point 50 feet directly above the 
intersection of the obstruction clearance plane and the runway. For the 
purposes of determining the allowable landing weight at the destination 
airport the following is assumed:
    (1) The airplane is landed on the most favorable runway and in the 
most favorable direction in still air.
    (2) The airplane is landed on the most suitable runway considering 
the probable wind velocity and direction (forecast for the expected time 
of arrival), the ground handling characteristics of the type of 
airplane, and other conditions such as landing aids and terrain, and 
allowing for the effect of the landing path and roll of not more than 50 
percent of the headwind component or not less than 150 percent of the 
tailwind component.
    (b) An airplane that would be prohibited from being taken off 
because it could not meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section may be taken off if an alternate airport is specified that meets 
all of the requirements of this section except that the airplane can 
accomplish a full stop landing within 70 percent of the effective length 
of the runway.
    (c) This section does not apply to large nontransport category 
airplanes operated under Sec. 121.173(c).

Sec. 121.189  Airplanes: Turbine engine powered: Takeoff limitations.

    (a) No person operating a turbine engine powered airplane may take 
off that airplane at a weight greater than that listed in the Airplane 
Flight Manual for the elevation of the airport and for the ambient 
temperature existing at takeoff.
    (b) No person operating a turbine engine powered airplane 
certificated after August 26, 1957, but before August 30, 1959 (SR422, 
422A), may take off that airplane at a weight greater than that listed 
in the Airplane Flight Manual for the minimum distances required for 
takeoff. In the case of an airplane certificated after September 30, 
1958 (SR422A, 422B), the takeoff distance may include a clearway 
distance but the clearway distance included may not be greater than \1/
2\ of the takeoff run.
    (c) No person operating a turbine engine powered airplane 
certificated after August 29, 1959 (SR422B), may take off that airplane 
at a weight greater than that listed in the Airplane Flight Manual at 
which compliance with the following may be shown:
    (1) The accelerate-stop distance must not exceed the length of the 
runway plus the length of any stopway.
    (2) The takeoff distance must not exceed the length of the runway 
plus the length of any clearway except that the length of any clearway 
included must not be greater than one-half the length of the runway.
    (3) The takeoff run must not be greater than the length of the 
runway.
    (d) No person operating a turbine engine powered airplane may take 
off that airplane at a weight greater than that listed in the Airplane 
Flight Manual--
    (1) In the case of an airplane certificated after August 26, 1957, 
but before October 1, 1958 (SR422), that allows a takeoff path that 
clears all obstacles either by at least (35+0.01D) feet vertically (D is 
the distance along the intended flight path from the end of the runway 
in feet), or by at least 200 feet horizontally within the airport 
boundaries and by at least 300 feet horizontally after passing the 
boundaries; or
    (2) In the case of an airplane certificated after September 30, 1958 
(SR 422A, 422B), that allows a net takeoff flight path that clears all 
obstacles either by a height of at least 35 feet vertically, or by at 
least 200 feet horizontally within the airport boundaries and by at 
least 300 feet horizontally after passing the boundaries.
    (e) In determining maximum weights, minimum distances, and flight 
paths under paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, correction must 
be made for the runway to be used, the elevation of the airport, the 
effective runway gradient, the ambient temperature and wind component at 
the time of takeoff, and, if operating limitations exist for the minimum 
distances required for takeoff from wet runways, the runway surface 
condition (dry or wet). Wet runway distances associated with grooved or 
porous friction course runways, if provided in the Airplane Flight 
Manual, may be used only for runways that are grooved or treated with a 
porous friction course (PFC) overlay, and that the operator determines 
are designed, constructed, and maintained in a manner acceptable to the 
Administrator.
    (f) For the purposes of this section, it is assumed that the 
airplane is not banked before reaching a height of 50 feet, as shown by 
the takeoff path or net takeoff flight path data (as appropriate) in the 
Airplane Flight Manual, and thereafter that the maximum bank is not more 
than 15 degrees.
    (g) For the purposes of this section the terms, takeoff distance, 
takeoff run, net takeoff flight path and takeoff path have the same 
meanings as set forth in the rules under which the airplane was 
certificated.

Sec. 121.191  Airplanes: Turbine engine powered: En route limitations: 
One engine inoperative.

    (a) No person operating a turbine engine powered airplane may take 
off that airplane at a weight, allowing for normal consumption of fuel 
and oil, that is greater than that which (under the approved, one engine 
inoperative, en route net flight path data in the

[[Page 438]]

Airplane Flight Manual for that airplane) will allow compliance with 
paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section, based on the ambient 
temperatures expected en route:
    (1) There is a positive slope at an altitude of at least 1,000 feet 
above all terrain and obstructions within five statute miles on each 
side of the intended track, and, in addition, if that airplane was 
certificated after August 29, 1959 (SR 422B) there is a positive slope 
at 1,500 feet above the airport where the airplane is assumed to land 
after an engine fails.
    (2) The net flight path allows the airplane to continue flight from 
the cruising altitude to an airport where a landing can be made under 
Sec. 121.197, clearing all terrain and obstructions within five statute 
miles of the intended track by at least 2,000 feet vertically and with a 
positive slope at 1,000 feet above the airport where the airplane lands 
after an engine fails, or, if that airplane was certificated after 
September 30, 1958 (SR 422A, 422B), with a positive slope at 1,500 feet 
above the airport where the airplane lands after an engine fails.
    (b) For the purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it is 
assumed that--
    (1) The engine fails at the most critical point en route;
    (2) The airplane passes over the critical obstruction, after engine 
failure at a point that is no closer to the obstruction than the nearest 
approved radio navigation fix, unless the Administrator authorizes a 
different procedure based on adequate operational safeguards;
    (3) An approved method is used to allow for adverse winds:
    (4) Fuel jettisoning will be allowed if the certificate holder shows 
that the crew is properly instructed, that the training program is 
adequate, and that all other precautions are taken to insure a safe 
procedure;
    (5) The alternate airport is specified in the dispatch or flight 
release and meets the prescribed weather minimums; and
    (6) The consumption of fuel and oil after engine failure is the same 
as the consumption that is allowed for in the approved net flight path 
data in the Airplane Flight Manual.

Sec. 121.193  Airplanes: Turbine engine powered: En route limitations: 
Two engines inoperative.

    (a) Airplanes certificated after August 26, 1957, but before October 
1, 1958 (SR 422). No person may operate a turbine engine powered 
airplane along an intended route unless he complies with either of the 
following:
    (1) There is no place along the intended track that is more than 90 
minutes (with all engines operating at cruising power) from an airport 
that meets the requirements of Sec. 121.197.
    (2) Its weight, according to the two-engine-inoperative, en route, 
net flight path data in the Airplane Flight Manual, allows the airplane 
to fly from the point where the two engines are assumed to fail 
simultaneously to an airport that meets the requirements of Sec. 
121.197, with a net flight path (considering the ambient temperature 
anticipated along the track) having a positive slope at an altitude of 
at least 1,000 feet above all terrain and obstructions within five miles 
on each side of the intended track, or at an altitude of 5,000 feet, 
whichever is higher.

For the purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it is assumed that 
the two engines fail at the most critical point en route, that if fuel 
jettisoning is provided, the airplane's weight at the point where the 
engines fail includes enough fuel to continue to the airport and to 
arrive at an altitude of at least 1,000 feet directly over the airport, 
and that the fuel and oil consumption after engine failure is the same 
as the consumption allowed for in the net flight path data in the 
Airplane Flight Manual.
    (b) Aircraft certificated after September 30, 1958, but before 
August 30, 1959 (SR 422A). No person may operate a turbine engine 
powered airplane along an intended route unless he complies with either 
of the following:
    (1) There is no place along the intended track that is more than 90 
minutes (with all engines operating at

[[Page 439]]

cruising power) from an airport that meets the requirements of Sec. 
121.197.
    (2) Its weight, according to the two-engine-inoperative, en route, 
net flight path data in the Airplane Flight Manual, allows the airplane 
to fly from the point where the two engines are assumed to fail 
simultaneously to an airport that meets the requirements of Sec. 
121.197, with a net flight path (considering the ambient temperatures 
anticipated along the track) having a positive slope at an altitude of 
at least 1,000 feet above all terrain and obstructions within 5 miles on 
each side of the intended track, or at an altitude of 2,000 feet, 
whichever is higher.

For the purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, it is assumed that 
the two engines fail at the most critical point en route, that the 
airplane's weight at the point where the engines fail includes enough 
fuel to continue to the airport, to arrive at an altitude of at least 
1,500 feet directly over the airport, and thereafter to fly for 15 
minutes at cruise power or thrust, or both, and that the consumption of 
fuel and oil after engine failure is the same as the consumption allowed 
for in the net flight path data in the Airplane Flight Manual.
    (c) Aircraft certificated after August 29, 1959 (SR 422B). No person 
may operate a turbine engine powered airplane along an intended route 
unless he complies with either of the following:
    (1) There is no place along the intended track that is more than 90 
minutes (with all engines operating at cruising power) from an airport 
that meets the requirements of Sec. 121.197.
    (2) Its weight, according to the two-engine inoperative, en route, 
net flight path data in the Airplane Flight Manual, allows the airplane 
to fly from the point where the two engines are assumed to fail 
simultaneously to an airport that meets the requirements of Sec. 
121.197, with the net flight path (considering the ambient temperatures 
anticipated along the track) clearing vertically by at least 2,000 feet 
all terrain and obstructions within five statute miles (4.34 nautical 
miles) on each side of the intended track. For the purposes of this 
subparagraph, it is assumed that--
    (i) The two engines fail at the most critical point en route;
    (ii) The net flight path has a positive slope at 1,500 feet above 
the airport where the landing is assumed to be made after the engines 
fail;
    (iii) Fuel jettisoning will be approved if the certificate holder 
shows that the crew is properly instructed, that the training program is 
adequate, and that all other precautions are taken to ensure a safe 
procedure;
    (iv) The airplane's weight at the point where the two engines are 
assumed to fail provides enough fuel to continue to the airport, to 
arrive at an altitude of at least 1,500 feet directly over the airport, 
and thereafter to fly for 15 minutes at cruise power or thrust, or both; 
and
    (v) The consumption of fuel and oil after the engine failure is the 
same as the consumption that is allowed for in the net flight path data 
in the Airplane Flight Manual.


<R05>
Sec. 121.195  Airplanes: Turbine engine powered: Landing limitations: 
Destination airports.

    (a) No person operating a turbine engine powered airplane may take 
off that airplane at such a weight that (allowing for normal consumption 
of fuel and oil in flight to the destination or alternate airport) the 
weight of the airplane on arrival would exceed the landing weight set 
forth in the Airplane Flight Manual for the elevation of the destination 
or alternate airport and the ambient temperature anticipated at the time 
of landing.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this 
section, no person operating a turbine engine powered airplane may take 
off that airplane unless its weight on arrival, allowing for normal 
consumption of fuel and oil in flight (in accordance with the landing 
distance set forth in the Airplane Flight Manual for the elevation of 
the destination airport and the wind conditions anticipated there at the 
time of landing), would allow a full stop landing at the intended 
destination airport within 60 percent of the effective length of each 
runway described below from a point 50 feet above the intersection of 
the obstruction clearance plane

[[Page 440]]

and the runway. For the purpose of determining the allowable landing 
weight at the destination airport the following is assumed:
    (1) The airplane is landed on the most favorable runway and in the 
most favorable direction, in still air.
    (2) The airplane is landed on the most suitable runway considering 
the probable wind velocity and direction and the ground handling 
characteristics of the airplane, and considering other conditions such 
as landing aids and terrain.
    (c) A turbopropeller powered airplane that would be prohibited from 
being taken off because it could not meet the requirements of paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, may be taken off if an alternate airport is 
specified that meets all the requirements of this section except that 
the airplane can accomplish a full stop landing within 70 percent of the 
effective length of the runway.
    (d) Unless, based on a showing of actual operating landing 
techniques on wet runways, a shorter landing distance (but never less 
than that required by paragraph (b) of this section) has been approved 
for a specific type and model airplane and included in the Airplane 
Flight Manual, no person may takeoff a turbojet powered airplane when 
the appropriate weather reports and forecasts, or a combination thereof, 
indicate that the runways at the destination airport may be wet or 
slippery at the estimated time of arrival unless the effective runway 
length at the destination airport is at least 115 percent of the runway 
length required under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (e) A turbojet powered airplane that would be prohibited from being 
taken off because it could not meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section may be taken off if an alternate airport is specified 
that meets all the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.

the assumptions in Sec. 121.195 (b)) that airplane at the weight 
anticipated at the time of arrival can be brought to a full stop landing 
within 70 percent of the effective length of the runway for 
turbopropeller powered airplanes and 60 percent of the effective length 
of the runway for turbojet powered airplanes, from a point 50 feet above 
the intersection of the obstruction clearance plane and the runway. In 
the case of an alternate airport for departure, as provided in Sec. 
121.617, allowance may be made for fuel jettisoning in addition to 
normal consumption of fuel and oil when determining the weight 
anticipated at the time of arrival.

Sec. 121.198  Cargo service airplanes: Increased zero fuel and landing 
weights.

    (a) Notwithstanding the applicable structural provisions of the 
airworthiness regulations but subject to paragraphs (b) through (g) of 
this section, a certificate holder may operate (for cargo service only) 
any of the following airplanes (certificated under part 4b of the Civil 
Air Regulations effective before March 13, 1956) at increased zero fuel 
and landing weights--
    (1) DC-6A, DC-6B, DC-7B, and DC-7C; and
    (2) L1049B, C, D, E, F, G, and H, and the L1649A when modified in 
accordance with supplemental type certificate SA 4-1402.
    (b) The zero fuel weight (maximum weight of the airplane with no 
disposable fuel and oil) and the structural landing weight may be 
increased beyond the maximum approved in full compliance with applicable 
regulations only if the Administrator finds that--
    (1) The increase is not likely to reduce seriously the structural 
strength;
    (2) The probability of sudden fatigue failure is not noticeably 
increased;
    (3) The flutter, deformation, and vibration characteristics do not 
fall below those required by applicable regulations; and
    (4) All other applicable weight limitations will be met.

[[Page 441]]

    (c) No zero fuel weight may be increased by more than five percent, 
and the increase in the structural landing weight may not exceed the 
amount, in pounds, of the increase in zero fuel weight.
    (d) Each airplane must be inspected in accordance with the approved 
special inspection procedures, for operations at increased weights, 
established and issued by the manufacturer of the type of airplane.
    (e) Each airplane operated under this section must be operated in 
accordance with the passenger-carrying performance operating limitations 
prescribed in this part.
    (f) The Airplane Flight Manual for each airplane operated under this 
section must be appropriately revised to include the operating 
limitations and information needed for operation at the increased 
weights.
    (g) Except as provided for the carrying of persons under Sec. 
121.583 each airplane operated at an increased weight under this section 
must, before it is used in passenger service, be inspected under the 
special inspection procedures for return to passenger service 
established and issued by the manufacturer and approved by the 
Administrator.

Sec. 121.199  Nontransport category airplanes: Takeoff limitations.

    (a) No person operating a non transport category airplane may take 
off that airplane at a weight greater than the weight that would allow 
the airplane to be brought to a safe stop within the effective length of 
the runway, from any point during the takeoff before reaching 105 
percent of minimum control speed (the minimum speed at which an airplane 
can be safely controlled in flight after an engine becomes inoperative) 
or 115 percent of the power off stalling speed in the takeoff 
configuration, whichever is greater.
    (b) For the purposes of this section--
    (1) It may be assumed that takeoff power is used on all engines 
during the acceleration;
    (2) Not more than 50 percent of the reported headwind component, or 
not less than 150 percent of the reported tailwind component, may be 
taken into account;
    (3) The average runway gradient (the difference between the 
elevations of the endpoints of the runway divided by the total length) 
must be considered if it is more than one-half of 1 percent;
    (4) It is assumed that the airplane is operating in standard 
atmosphere; and
    (5) The effective length of the runway for takeoff means the 
distance from the end of the runway at which the takeoff is started to a 
point at which the obstruction clearance plane associated with the other 
end of the runway intersects the runway centerline.

One engine inoperative.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no person 
operating a nontransport category airplane may take off that airplane at 
a weight that does not allow a rate of climb of at least 50 feet a 
minute, with the critical engine inoperative, at an altitude of at least 
1,000 feet above the highest obstruction within five miles on each side 
of the intended track, or 5,000 feet, whichever is higher.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, if the

operate the airplane at an altitude that allows the airplane, in case of 
engine failure, to clear all obstructions within 5 miles on each side of 
the intended track by 1,000 feet. If this procedure is used, the rate of 
descent for the appropriate weight and altitude is assumed to be 50 feet 
a minute greater than the rate in the approved performance data. Before 
approving such a procedure, the Administrator considers the following 
for the route, route segment, or area concerned:
    (1) The reliability of wind and weather forecasting.
    (2) The location and kinds of navigation aids.
    (3) The prevailing weather conditions, particularly the frequency 
and amount of turbulence normally encountered.

[[Page 442]]

    (4) Terrain features.
    (5) Air traffic control problems.
    (6) Any other operational factors that affect the operation.
    (c) For the purposes of this section, it is assumed that--
    (1) The critical engine is inoperative;
    (2) The propeller of the inoperative engine is in the minimum drag 
position;
    (3) The wing flaps and landing gear are in the most favorable 
position;
    (4) The operating engines are operating at the maximum continuous 
power available;
    (5) The airplane is operating in standard atmosphere; and
    (6) The weight of the airplane is progressively reduced by the 
anticipated consumption of fuel and oil.


<R05>
Sec. 121.203  Nontransport category airplanes: Landing limitations: 
Destination airport.

    (a) No person operating a non transport category airplane may take 
off that airplane at a weight that--
    (1) Allowing for anticipated consumption of fuel and oil, is greater 
than the weight that would allow a full stop landing within 60 percent 
of the effective length of the most suitable runway at the destination 
airport; and
    (2) Is greater than the weight allowable if the landing is to be 
made on the runway--
    (i) With the greatest effective length in still air; and
    (ii) Required by the probable wind, taking into account not more 
than 50 percent of the headwind component or not less than 150 percent 
of the tailwind component.
    (b) For the purposes of this section, it is assumed that--
    (1) The airplane passes directly over the intersection of the 
obstruction clearance plane and the runway at a height of 50 feet in a 
steady gliding approach at a true indicated airspeed of at least 1.3 
VS<INF>o</INF>;

or flight release for a nontransport category airplane unless that 
airplane (at the weight anticipated at the time of arrival) based on the 
assumptions contained in Sec. 121.203, can be brought to a full stop 
landing within 70 percent of the effective length of the runway.


<R05>
Sec. 121.207  Provisionally certificated airplanes: Operating limitations.

    In addition to the limitations in Sec. 91.317 of this chapter, the 
following limitations apply to the operation of provisionally 
certificated airplanes by certificate holders:
    (a) In addition to crewmembers, each certificate holder may carry on 
such an airplane only those persons who are listed in Sec. 121.547(c) 
or who are specifically authorized by both the certificate holder and 
the Administrator.
    (b) Each certificate holder shall keep a log of each flight 
conducted under this section and shall keep accurate and complete 
records of each inspection made and all maintenance performed on the 
airplane. The certificate holder shall make the log and records made 
under this section available to the manufacturer and the Administrator.

Sec. 121.310  Additional emergency equipment.

    (a) Means for emergency evacuation. Each passenger-carrying 
landplane emergency exit (other than over-the-wing) that is more than 6 
feet from the ground with the airplane on the ground

[[Page 455]]

and the landing gear extended, must have an approved means to assist the 
occupants in descending to the ground. The assisting means for a floor-
level emergency exit must meet the requirements of Sec. 25.809(f)(1) of 
this chapter in effect on April 30, 1972, except that, for any airplane 
for which the application for the type certificate was filed after that 
date, it must meet the requirements under which the airplane was type 
certificated. An assisting means that deploys automatically must be 
armed during taxiing, takeoffs, and landings. However, if the 
Administrator finds that the design of the exit makes compliance 
impractical, he may grant a deviation from the requirement of automatic 
deployment if the assisting means automatically erects upon deployment 
and, with respect to required emergency exits, if an emergency 
evacuation demonstration is conducted in accordance with Sec. 
121.291(a). This paragraph does not apply to the rear window emergency 
exit of DC-3 airplanes operated with less than 36 occupants, including 
crewmembers and less than five exits authorized for passenger use.
    (b) Interior emergency exit marking. The following must be complied 
with for each passenger-carrying airplane:
    (1) Each passenger emergency exit, its means of access, and its 
means of opening must be conspicuously marked. The identity and location 
of each passenger emergency exit must be recognizable from a distance 
equal to the width of the cabin. The location of each passenger 
emergency exit must be indicated by a sign visible to occupants 
approaching along the main passenger aisle. There must be a locating 
sign--
    (i) Above the aisle near each over-the-wing passenger emergency 
exit, or at another ceiling location if it is more practical because of 
low headroom;
    (ii) Next to each floor level passenger emergency exit, except that 
one sign may serve two such exits if they both can be seen readily from 
that sign; and
    (iii) On each bulkhead or divider that prevents fore and aft vision 
along the passenger cabin, to indicate emergency exits beyond and 
obscured by it, except that if this is not possible the sign may be 
placed at another appropriate location.
    (2) Each passenger emergency exit marking and each locating sign 
must meet the following:
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, for 
an airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed 
prior to May 1, 1972, each passenger emergency exit marking and each 
locating sign must be manufactured to meet the requirements of Sec. 
25.812(b) of this chapter in effect on April 30, 1972. On these 
airplanes, no sign may continue to be used if its luminescence 
(brightness) decreases to below 100 microlamberts. The colors may be 
reversed if it increases the emergency illumination of the passenger 
compartment. However, the Administrator may authorize deviation from the 
2-inch background requirements if he finds that special circumstances 
exist that make compliance impractical and that the proposed deviation 
provides an equivalent level of safety.
    (ii) For a transport category airplane for which the application for 
the type certificate was filed on or after May 1, 1972, each passenger 
emergency exit marking and each locating sign must be manufactured to 
meet the interior emergency exit marking requirements under which the 
airplane was type certificated. On these airplanes, no sign may continue 
to be used if its luminescence (brightness) decreases to below 250 
microlamberts.
    (iii) For a nontransport category turbopropeller powered airplane 
type certificated after December 31, 1964, each passenger emergency exit 
marking and each locating sign must be manufactured to meet the 
requirements of Sec. 23.811(b) of this chapter. On these airplanes, no 
sign may continue to be used if its luminescence (brightness) decreases 
to below 100 microlamberts.
    (c) Lighting for interior emergency exit markings. Except for 
nontransport category airplanes type certificated after December 31, 
1964, each passenger-carrying airplane must have an emergency lighting 
system, independent of the main lighting system. However, sources of 
general cabin illumination may be common to both the emergency and the 
main lighting systems if the

[[Page 456]]

power supply to the emergency lighting system is independent of the 
power supply to the main lighting system.
    The emergency lighting system must--
    (1) Illuminate each passenger exit marking and locating sign;
    (2) Provide enough general lighting in the passenger cabin so that 
the average illumination when measured at 40-inch intervals at seat 
armrest height, on the centerline of the main passenger aisle, is at 
least 0.05 foot-candles; and
    (3) For airplanes type certificated after January 1, 1958, after 
November 26, 1986, include floor proximity emergency escape path marking 
which meets the requirements of Sec. 25.812(e) of this chapter in 
effect on November 26, 1984.
    (d) Emergency light operation. Except for lights forming part of 
emergency lighting subsystems provided in compliance with Sec. 
25.812(h) of this chapter (as prescribed in paragraph (h) of this 
section) that serve no more than one assist means, are independent of 
the airplane's main emergency lighting systems, and are automatically 
activated when the assist means is deployed, each light required by 
paragraphs (c) and (h) of this section must comply with the following:
    (1) Each light must--
    (i) Be operable manually both from the flightcrew station and, for 
airplanes on which a flight attendant is required, from a point in the 
passenger compartment that is readily accessible to a normal flight 
attendant seat;
    (ii) Have a means to prevent inadvertent operation of the manual 
controls; and
    (iii) When armed or turned on at either station, remain lighted or 
become lighted upon interruption of the airplane's normal electric 
power.
    (2) Each light must be armed or turned on during taxiing, takeoff, 
and landing. In showing compliance with this paragraph a transverse 
vertical separation of the fuselage need not be considered.
    (3) Each light must provide the required level of illumination for 
at least 10 minutes at the critical ambient conditions after emergency 
landing.
    (4) Each light must have a cockpit control device that has an 
``on,'' ``off,'' and ``armed'' position.
    (e) Emergency exit operating handles. (1) For a passenger-carrying 
airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed 
prior to May 1, 1972, the location of each passenger emergency exit 
operating handle, and instructions for opening the exit, must be shown 
by a marking on or near the exit that is readable from a distance of 30 
inches. In addition, for each Type I and Type II emergency exit with a 
locking mechanism released by rotary motion of the handle, the 
instructions for opening must be shown by--
    (i) A red arrow with a shaft at least three-fourths inch wide and a 
head twice the width of the shaft, extending along at least 70[deg] of 
arc at a radius approximately equal to three-fourths of the handle 
length; and
    (ii) The word ``open'' in red letters 1 inch high placed 
horizontally near the head of the arrow.
    (2) For a passenger-carrying airplane for which the application for 
the type certificate was filed on or after May 1, 1972, the location of 
each passenger emergency exit operating handle and instructions for 
opening the exit must be shown in accordance with the requirements under 
which the airplane was type certificated. On these airplanes, no 
operating handle or operating handle cover may continue to be used if 
its luminescence (brightness) decreases to below 100 microlamberts.
    (f) Emergency exit access. Access to emergency exits must be 
provided as follows for each passenger-carrying transport category 
airplane:
    (1) Each passage way between individual passenger areas, or leading 
to a Type I or Type II emergency exit, must be unobstructed and at least 
20 inches wide.
    (2) For each Type I or Type II emergency exit equipped with an 
assist means, there must be enough space next to the exit to allow a 
crewmember to assist in the evacuation of passengers without reducing 
the unobstructed width of the passageway below that required in 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section. In addition, all airplanes 
manufactured on or after November 26, 2008 must comply with the 
provisions of

[[Page 457]]

Sec. Sec. 25.813(b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3) and (b)(4) in effect on November 
26, 2004. However, a deviation from this requirement may be authorized 
for an airplane certificated under the provisions of part 4b of the 
Civil Air Regulations in effect before December 20, 1951, if the 
Administrator finds that special circumstances exist that provide an 
equivalent level of safety.
    (3) There must be access from the main aisle to each Type III and 
Type IV exit. The access from the aisle to these exits must not be 
obstructed by seats, berths, or other protrusions in a manner that would 
reduce the effectiveness of the exit. In addition--
    (i) For an airplane for which the application for the type 
certificate was filed prior to May 1, 1972, the access must meet the 
requirements of Sec. 25.813(c) of this chapter in effect on April 30, 
1972; and
    (ii) For an airplane for which the application for the type 
certificate was filed on or after May 1, 1972, the access must meet the 
emergency exit access requirements under which the airplane was type 
certificated; except that,
    (iii) After December 3, 1992, the access for an airplane type 
certificated after January 1, 1958, must meet the requirements of Sec. 
25.813(c) of this chapter, effective June 3, 1992.
    (iv) Contrary provisions of this section notwithstanding, the 
Manager of the Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification 
Service, Federal Aviation Administration, may authorize deviation from 
the requirements of paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section if it is 
determined that special circumstances make compliance impractical. Such 
special circumstances include, but are not limited to, the following 
conditions when they preclude achieving compliance with Sec. 
25.813(c)(1)(i) or (ii) without a reduction in the total number of 
passenger seats: emergency exits located in close proximity to each 
other; fixed installations such as lavatories, galleys, etc.; 
permanently mounted bulkheads; an insufficient number of rows ahead of 
or behind the exit to enable compliance without a reduction in the seat 
row pitch of more than one inch; or an insufficient number of such rows 
to enable compliance without a reduction in the seat row pitch to less 
than 30 inches. A request for such grant of deviation must include 
credible reasons as to why literal compliance with Sec. 25.813(c)(1)(i) 
or (ii) is impractical and a description of the steps taken to achieve a 
level of safety as close to that intended by Sec. 25.813(c)(1)(i) or 
(ii) as is practical.
    (v) The Manager of the Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft 
Certification Service, Federal Aviation Administration, may also 
authorize a compliance date later than December 3, 1992, if it is 
determined that special circumstances make compliance by that date 
impractical. A request for such grant of deviation must outline the 
airplanes for which compliance will be achieved by December 3, 1992, and 
include a proposed schedule for incremental compliance of the remaining 
airplanes in the operator's fleet. In addition, the request must include 
credible reasons why compliance cannot be achieved earlier.
    (4) If it is necessary to pass through a passageway between 
passenger compartments to reach any required emergency exit from any 
seat in the passenger cabin, the passageway must not be obstructed. 
However, curtains may be used if they allow free entry through the 
passageway.
    (5) No door may be installed in any partition between passenger 
compartments.
    (6) No person may operate an airplane manufactured after November 
27, 2006, that incorporates a door installed between any passenger seat 
occupiable for takeoff and landing and any passenger emergency exit, 
such that the door crosses any egress path (including aisles, 
crossaisles and passageways).
    (7) If it is necessary to pass through a doorway separating the 
passenger cabin from other areas to reach required emergency exit from 
any passenger seat, the door must have a means to latch it in open 
position, and the door must be latched open during each takeoff and 
landing. The latching means must be able to withstand the loads imposed 
upon it when the door is subjected to the ultimate inertia forces, 
relative to the surrounding structure, listed in Sec. 25.561(b) of this 
chapter.

[[Page 458]]

    (g) Exterior exit markings. Each passenger emergency exit and the 
means of opening that exit from the outside must be marked on the 
outside of the airplane. There must be a 2-inch colored band outlining 
each passenger emergency exit on the side of the fuselage. Each outside 
marking, including the band, must be readily distinguishable from the 
surrounding fuselage area by contrast in color. The markings must comply 
with the following:
    (1) If the reflectance of the darker color is 15 percent or less, 
the reflectance of the lighter color must be at least 45 percent.
    (2) If the reflectance of the darker color is greater than 15 
percent, at least a 30 percent difference between its reflectance and 
the reflectance of the lighter color must be provided.
    (3) Exits that are not in the side of the fuselage must have the 
external means of opening and applicable instructions marked 
conspicuously in red or, if red is inconspicuous against the background 
color, in bright chrome yellow and, when the opening means for such an 
exit is located on only one side of the fuselage, a conspicuous marking 
to that effect must be provided on the other side. Reflectance is the 
ratio of the luminous flux reflected by a body to the luminous flux it 
receives.
    (h) Exterior emergency lighting and escape route. (1) Except for 
nontransport category airplanes certificated after December 31, 1964, 
each passenger-carrying airplane must be equipped with exterior lighting 
that meets the following requirements:
    (i) For an airplane for which the application for the type 
certificate was filed prior to May 1, 1972, the requirements of Sec. 
25.812 (f) and (g) of this chapter in effect on April 30, 1972.
    (ii) For an airplane for which the application for the type 
certificate was filed on or after May 1, 1972, the exterior emergency 
lighting requirements under which the airplane was type certificated.
    (2) Each passenger-carrying airplane must be equipped with a slip-
resistant escape route that meets the following requirements:
    (i) For an airplane for which the application for the type 
certificate was filed prior to May 1, 1972, the requirements of Sec. 
25.803(e) of this chapter in effect on April 30, 1972.
    (ii) For an airplane for which the application for the type 
certificate was filed on or after May 1, 1972, the slip-resistant escape 
route requirements under which the airplane was type certificated.
    (i) Floor level exits. Each floor level door or exit in the side of 
the fuselage (other than those leading into a cargo or baggage 
compartment that is not accessible from the passenger cabin) that is 44 
or more inches high and 20 or more inches wide, but not wider than 46 
inches, each passenger ventral exit (except the ventral exits on M-404 
and CV-240 airplanes), and each tail cone exit, must meet the 
requirements of this section for floor level emergency exits. However, 
the Administrator may grant a deviation from this paragraph if he finds 
that circumstances make full compliance impractical and that an 
acceptable level of safety has been achieved.
    (j) Additional emergency exits. Approved emergency exits in the 
passenger compartments that are in excess of the minimum number of 
required emergency exits must meet all of the applicable provisions of 
this section except paragraphs (f)(1), (2), and (3) of this section and 
must be readily accessible.
    (k) On each large passenger-carrying turbojet-powered airplane, each 
ventral exit and tailcone exit must be--
    (1) Designed and constructed so that it cannot be opened during 
flight; and
    (2) Marked with a placard readable from a distance of 30 inches and 
installed at a conspicuous location near the means of opening the exit, 
stating that the exit has been designed and constructed so that it 
cannot be opened during flight.
    (l) Emergency exit features. (1) Each transport category airplane 
manufactured after November 26, 2007 must comply with the provisions of 
Sec. 25.809(i) and
    (2) After November 26, 2007 each transport category airplane must 
comply with the provisions of Sec. 25.813(b)(6)(ii) in effect on 
November 26, 2007.
    (m) Except for an airplane used in operations under this part on 
October 16,

[[Page 459]]

1987, and having an emergency exit configuration installed and 
authorized for operation prior to October 16, 1987, for an airplane that 
is required to have more than one passenger emergency exit for each side 
of the fuselage, no passenger emergency exit shall be more than 60 feet 
from any adjacent passenger emergency exit on the same side of the same 
deck of the fuselage, as measured parallel to the airplane's 
longitudinal axis between the nearest exit edges.
    (n) Portable lights. No person may operate a passenger-carrying 
airplane unless it is equipped with flashlight stowage provisions 
accessible from each flight attendant seat.

Sec. 121.327  Supplemental oxygen: Reciprocating engine powered airplanes.

    (a) General. Except where supplemental oxygen is provided in 
accordance with Sec. 121.331, no person may operate an airplane unless 
supplemental oxygen is furnished and used as set forth in paragraphs (b) 
and (c) of this section. The amount of supplemental oxygen required for 
a particular operation is determined on the basis of flight altitudes 
and flight duration, consistent with the operation procedures 
established for each operation and route.
    (b) Crewmembers. (1) At cabin pressure altitudes above 10,000 feet 
up to and including 12,000 feet, oxygen must be provided for, and used 
by, each member of the flight crew on flight deck duty, and must be 
provided for other crewmembers, for that part of the flight at those 
altitudes that is of more than 30 minutes duration.
    (2) At cabin pressure altitudes above 12,000 feet, oxygen must be 
provided for, and used by, each member of the flight crew on flight deck 
duty, and must be provided for other crewmembers, during the entire 
flight time at those altitudes.
    (3) When a flight crewmember is required to use oxygen, he must use 
it continuously, except when necessary to

[[Page 468]]

remove the oxygen mask or other dispenser in connection with his regular 
duties. Standby crewmembers who are on call or are definitely going to 
have flight deck duty before completing the flight must be provided with 
an amount of supplemental oxygen equal to that provided for crewmembers 
on duty other than on flight deck duty. If a standby crewmember is not 
on call and will not be on flight deck duty during the remainder of the 
flight, he is considered to be a passenger for the purposes of 
supplemental oxygen requirements.
    (c) Passengers. Each certificate holder shall provide a supply of 
oxygen, approved for passenger safety, in accordance with the following:
    (1) For flights of more than 30 minutes duration at cabin pressure 
altitudes above 8,000 feet up to and including 14,000 feet, enough 
oxygen for 30 minutes for 10 percent of the passengers.
    (2) For flights at cabin pressure altitudes above 14,000 feet up to 
and including 15,000 feet, enough oxygen for that part of the flight at 
those altitudes for 30 percent of the passengers.
    (3) For flights at cabin pressure altitudes above 15,000 feet, 
enough oxygen for each passenger carried during the entire flight at 
those altitudes.
    (d) For the purposes of this subpart cabin pressure altitude means 
the pressure altitude corresponding with the pressure in the cabin of 
the airplane, and flight altitude means the altitude above sea level at 
which the airplane is operated. For airplanes without pressurized 
cabins, ``cabin pressure altitude'' and ``flight altitude'' mean the

Sec. 121.329  Supplemental oxygen for sustenance: Turbine engine powered 
airplanes.

    (a) General. When operating a turbine engine powered airplane, each 
certificate holder shall equip the airplane with sustaining oxygen and 
dispensing equipment for use as set forth in this section:
    (1) The amount of oxygen provided must be at least the quantity 
necessary to comply with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (2) The amount of sustaining and first-aid oxygen required for a 
particular operation to comply with the rules in this part is determined 
on the basis of cabin pressure altitudes and flight duration, consistent 
with the operating procedures established for each operation and route.
    (3) The requirements for airplanes with pressurized cabins are 
determined on the basis of cabin pressure altitude and the assumption 
that a cabin pressurization failure will occur at the altitude or point 
of flight that is most critical from the standpoint of oxygen need, and 
that after the failure the airplane will descend in accordance with the 
emergency procedures specified in the Airplane Flight Manual, without 
exceeding its operating limitations, to a flight altitude that will 
allow successful termination of the flight.
    (4) Following the failure, the cabin pressure altitude is considered 
to be the same as the flight altitude unless it is shown that no 
probable failure of the cabin or pressurization equipment will result in 
a cabin pressure altitude equal to the flight altitude. Under those 
circumstances, the maximum cabin pressure altitude attained may be used 
as a basis for certification or determination of oxygen supply, or both.
    (b) Crewmembers. Each certificate holder shall provide a supply of 
oxygen for crewmembers in accordance with the following:
    (1) At cabin pressure altitudes above 10,000 feet, up to and 
including 12,000 feet, oxygen must be provided for and used by each 
member of the flight crew on flight deck duty and must be provided for 
other crewmembers for that part of the flight at those altitudes that is 
of more than 30 minutes duration.
    (2) At cabin pressure altitudes above 12,000 feet, oxygen must be 
provided for, and used by, each member of the flight crew on flight deck 
duty, and must be provided for other crewmembers during the entire 
flight at those altitudes.
    (3) When a flight crewmember is required to use oxygen, he must use 
it continuously except when necessary to remove the oxygen mask or other 
dispenser in connection with his regular

[[Page 469]]

duties. Standby crewmembers who are on call or are definitely going to 
have flight deck duty before completing the flight must be provided with 
an amount of supplemental oxygen equal to that provided for crewmembers 
on duty other than on flight duty. If a standby crewmember is not on 
call and will not be on flight deck duty during the remainder of the 
flight, he is considered to be a passenger for the purposes of 
supplemental oxygen requirements.
    (c) Passengers. Each certificate holder shall provide a supply of 
oxygen for passengers in accordance with the following:
    (1) For flights at cabin pressure altitudes above 10,000 feet, up to 
and including 14,000 feet, enough oxygen for that part of the flight at 
those altitudes that is of more than 30 minutes duration, for 10 percent 
of the passengers.
    (2) For flights at cabin pressure altitudes above 14,000 feet, up to 
and including 15,000 feet, enough oxygen for that part of the flight at 
those altitudes for 30 percent of the passengers.
    (3) For flights at cabin pressure altitudes above 15,000 feet, 
enough oxygen for each passenger carried during the entire flight at 
those altitudes.


<R05>
Sec. 121.331  Supplemental oxygen requirements for pressurized cabin 
airplanes: Reciprocating engine powered airplanes.

    (a) When operating a reciprocating engine powered airplane 
pressurized cabin, each certificate holder shall equip the airplane to 
comply with paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section in the event of 
cabin pressurization failure.
    (b) For crewmembers. When operating at flight altitudes above 10,000 
feet, the certificate holder shall provide enough oxygen for each 
crewmember for the entire flight at those altitudes and not less than a 
two-hour supply for each flight crewmember on flight deck duty. The 
required two hours supply is that quantity of oxygen necessary for a 
constant rate of descent from the airplane's maximum certificated 
operating altitude to 10,000 feet in ten minutes and followed by 110 
minutes at 10,000 feet. The oxygen required by Sec. 121.337 may be 
considered in determining the supplemental breathing supply required for 
flight crewmembers on flight deck duty in the event of cabin 
pressurization failure.
    (c) For passengers. When operating at flight altitudes above 8,000 
feet, the certificate holder shall provide oxygen as follows:
    (1) When an airplane is not flown at a flight altitude above flight 
level 250, enough oxygen for 30 minutes for 10 percent of the 
passengers, if at any point along the route to be flown the airplane can 
safely descend to a flight altitude of 14,000 feet or less within four 
minutes.
    (2) If the airplane cannot descend to a flight altitude of 14,000 
feet or less within four minutes, the following supply of oxygen must be 
provided:
    (i) For that part of the flight that is more than four minutes 
duration at flight altitudes above 15,000 feet, the supply required by 
Sec. 121.327(c)(3).
    (ii) For that part of the flight at flight altitudes above 14,000 
feet, up to and including 15,000 feet, the supply required by Sec. 
121.327(c)(2).
    (iii) For flight at flight altitudes above 8,000 feet up to and 
including 14,000 feet, enough oxygen for 30 minutes for 10 percent of 
the passengers.
    (3) When an airplane is flown at a flight altitude above flight 
level 250, enough oxygen for 30 minutes for 10 percent of the passengers 
for the entire flight (including emergency descent) above 8,000 feet, up 
to and including 14,000 feet, and to comply with Sec. 121.327(c) (2) 
and (3) for flight above 14,000 feet.
    (d) For the purposes of this section it is assumed that the cabin 
pressurization failure occurs at a time during flight that is critical 
from the standpoint of oxygen need and that after the failure the 
airplane will descend, without exceeding its normal operating 
limitations, to flight altitudes allowing safe flight with respect to 
terrain clearance.

crewmember on flight deck duty. The required two hours supply is that 
quantity of oxygen necessary for a constant rate of descent from the 
airplane's maximum certificated operating altitude to 10,000 feet in ten 
minutes and followed by 110 minutes at 10,000 feet. The oxygen required 
in the event of cabin pressurization failure by Sec. 121.337 may be 
included in determining the supply required for flight crewmembers on 
flight deck duty.
    (c) Use of oxygen masks by flight crewmembers. (1) When operating at 
flight altitudes above flight level 250, each flight crewmember on 
flight deck duty must be provided with an oxygen mask so designed that 
it can be rapidly placed on his face from its ready position, properly 
secured, sealed, and supplying oxygen upon demand; and so designed that 
after being placed on the face it does not prevent immediate 
communication between the flight crewmember and other crewmembers over 
the airplane intercommunication system. When it is not being used at 
flight altitudes above flight level 250, the oxygen mask must be kept in 
condition for ready use and located so as to be within the immediate 
reach of the flight crewmember while at his duty station.
    (2) When operating at flight altitudes above flight level 250, one 
pilot at the controls of the airplane shall at all times wear and use an 
oxygen mask secured, sealed, and supplying oxygen, in accordance with 
the following:
    (i) The one pilot need not wear and use an oxygen mask at or below 
the following flight levels if each flight crewmember on flight deck 
duty has a quick-donning type of oxygen mask that the certificate holder 
has shown can be placed on the face from its ready position, properly 
secured, sealed, and supplying oxygen upon demand, with one hand and 
within five seconds:
    (A) For airplanes having a passenger seat configuration of more than 
30 seats, excluding any required crewmember seat, or a payload capacity 
of more than 7,500 pounds, at or below flight level 410.
    (B) For airplanes having a passenger seat configuration of less than 
31 seats, excluding any required crewmember seat, and a payload capacity 
of 7,500 pounds or less, at or below flight level 350.
    (ii) Whenever a quick-donning type of oxygen mask is to be used 
under this section, the certificate holder shall also show that the mask 
can be put on without disturbing eye glasses and without delaying the 
flight crewmember from proceeding with his assigned emergency duties. 
The oxygen mask after being put on must not prevent immediate 
communication between the flight crewmember and other crewmembers over 
the airplane intercommunication system.
    (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if for any 
reason at any time it is necessary for one pilot to leave his station at 
the controls of the airplane when operating at flight altitudes above 
flight level 250, the remaining pilot at the controls shall put on and 
use his oxygen mask until the other pilot has returned to his duty 
station.
    (4) Before the takeoff of a flight, each flight crewmember shall 
personally preflight his oxygen equipment to insure that the oxygen mask 
is functioning, fitted properly, and connected to appropriate supply 
terminals, and that the oxygen supply and pressure are adequate for use.
    (d) Use of portable oxygen equipment by cabin attendants. After 
November 28, 2005 each mask used for portable oxygen equipment must be 
connected to its oxygen supply. Above flight level 250, one of the 
following is required:
    (1) Each attendant shall carry portable oxygen equipment with a 15 
minute supply of oxygen; or

[[Page 471]]

    (2) There must be sufficient portable oxygen equipment (including 
masks and spare outlets) distributed throughout the cabin so that such 
equipment is immediately available to each attendant, regardless of 
their location in the cabin; or
    (3) There are sufficient spare outlets and masks distributed 
throughout the cabin to ensure immediate availability of oxygen to each 
cabin attendant, regardless of their location in the cabin.
    (e) Passenger cabin occupants. When the airplane is operating at 
flight altitudes above 10,000 feet, the following supply of oxygen must 
be provided for the use of passenger cabin occupants:
    (1) When an airplane certificated to operate at flight altitudes up 
to and including flight level 250, can at any point along the route to 
be flown, descend safely to a flight altitude of 14,000 feet or less 
within four minutes, oxygen must be available at the rate prescribed by 
this part for a 30-minute period for at least 10 percent of the 
passenger cabin occupants.
    (2) When an airplane is operated at flight altitudes up to and 
including flight level 250 and cannot descend safely to a flight 
altitude of 14,000 feet within four minutes, or when an airplane is 
operated at flight altitudes above flight level 250, oxygen must be 
available at the rate prescribed by this part for not less than 10 
percent of the passenger cabin occupants for the entire flight after 
cabin depressurization, at cabin pressure altitudes above 10,000 feet up 
to and including 14,000 feet and, as applicable, to allow compliance 
with Sec. 121.329(c) (2) and (3), except that there must be not less 
than a 10-minute supply for the passenger cabin occupants.
    (3) For first-aid treatment of occupants who for physiological 
reasons might require undiluted oxygen following descent from cabin 
pressure altitudes above flight level 250, a supply of oxygen in 
accordance with the requirements of Sec. 25.1443(d) must be provided 
for two percent of the occupants for the entire flight after cabin 
depressurization at cabin pressure altitudes above 8,000 feet, but in no 
case to less than one person. An appropriate number of acceptable 
dispensing units, but in no case less than two, must be provided, with a 
means for the cabin attendants to use this supply.
    (f) Passenger briefing. Before flight is conducted above flight 
level 250, a crewmember shall instruct the passengers on the necessity 
of using oxygen in the event of cabin depressurization and shall point 
out to them the location and demonstrate the use of the oxygen-
dispensing equipment.

any, that must be corrected.
    (c) The Administrator grants final approval of the training program 
or revision if the certificate holder shows that the training conducted 
under the initial approval set forth in paragraph (b) of this section 
ensures that each person that successfully completes the training is 
adequately trained to perform his assigned duties.
    (d) In granting initial and final approval of training programs or 
revisions, including reductions in programmed hours specified in this 
subpart, the Administrator considers the training aids, devices, 
methods, and procedures listed in the certificate holder's curriculum as 
set forth in Sec. 121.403 that increase the quality and effectiveness 
of the teaching-learning process.

If approval of reduced programmed hours of training is granted, the 
Administrator provides the certificate holder with a statement of the 
basis for the approval.
    (e) Whenever the Administrator finds that revisions are necessary 
for the continued adequacy of a training program that has been granted 
final approval, the certificate holder shall, after notification by the 
Administrator, make any changes in the program that are found necessary 
by the Administrator. Within 30 days after the certificate holder 
receives such notice, it may file a petition to reconsider the notice 
with the certificate-holding district office. The filing of a petition 
to reconsider stays the notice pending a decision by the Administrator. 
However, if the Administrator finds that there is an emergency that 
requires immediate action in the interest of safety in air 
transportation, he may, upon a statement of the reasons, require a 
change effective without stay.
    (f) Each certificate holder described in Sec. 135.3 (b) and (c) of 
this chapter must include the material required by Sec. 121.403 in the 
manual required by Sec. 135.21 of this chapter.
    (g) The Administrator may grant a deviation to certificate holders 
described in Sec. 135.3 (b) and (c) of this chapter to allow reduced 
programmed hours of ground training required by Sec. 121.419 if it is 
found that a reduction is warranted based on the certificate holder's 
operations and the complexity of the make, model, and series of the 
aircraft used.

Sec. 121.434  Operating experience, operating cycles, and consolidation 
of knowledge and skills.

    (a) No certificate holder may use a person nor may any person serve 
as a required crewmember of an airplane unless the person has 
satisfactorily completed, on that type airplane and in that crewmember 
position, the operating experience, operating cycles, and the line 
operating flight time for consolidation of knowledge and skills, 
required by this section, except as follows:
    (1) Crewmembers other than pilots in command may serve as provided 
herein for the purpose of meeting the requirements of this section.
    (2) Pilots who are meeting the pilot in command requirements may 
serve as second in command.
    (3) Separate operating experience, operating cycles, and line 
operating flight time for consolidation of knowledge and skills are not 
required for variations within the same type airplane.
    (b) In acquiring the operating experience, operating cycles, and 
line operating flight time for consolidation of knowledge and skills, 
crewmembers must comply with the following:
    (1) In the case of a flight crewmember, he must hold the appropriate 
certificates and ratings for the crewmember position and the airplane, 
except that a pilot who is meeting the pilot in command requirements 
must hold the appropriate certificates and ratings for a pilot in 
command in the airplane.
    (2) The operating experience, operating cycles, and line operating 
flight time for consolidation of knowledge and skills must be acquired 
after satisfactory completion of the appropriate ground and flight 
training for the particular airplane type and crewmember position.
    (3) The experience must be acquired in flight during operations 
under this part. However, in the case of an aircraft not previously used 
by the certificate holder in operations under this part, operating 
experience acquired in the aircraft during proving flights or ferry 
flights may be used to meet this requirement.
    (c) Pilot crewmembers must acquire operating experience and 
operating cycles as follows:
    (1) A pilot in command must--
    (i) Perform the duties of a pilot in command under the supervision 
of a check pilot; and
    (ii) In addition, if a qualifying pilot in command is completing 
initial or upgrade training specified in Sec. 121.424, be observed in 
the performance of prescribed duties by an FAA inspector during at least 
one flight leg which includes a takeoff and landing. During the time 
that a qualifying pilot in command is acquiring the operating experience 
in paragraphs (c)(l) (i) and (ii) of this section, a check pilot who is 
also serving as the pilot in command must occupy a pilot station. 
However, in the case of a transitioning pilot in command the check pilot 
serving as pilot in command may occupy the observer's seat, if the 
transitioning pilot has made at least two takeoffs and landings in the 
type airplane used, and has satisfactorily demonstrated to the check 
pilot that he is qualified to perform the duties of a pilot in command 
of that type of airplane.
    (2) A second in command pilot must perform the duties of a second in 
command under the supervision of an appropriately qualified check pilot.
    (3) The hours of operating experience and operating cycles for all 
pilots are as follows:
    (i) For initial training, 15 hours in Group I reciprocating powered 
airplanes, 20 hours in Group I turbopropeller powered airplanes, and 25 
hours in Group II airplanes. Operating experience in both airplane 
groups must include at least 4 operating cycles (at least 2 as the pilot 
flying the airplane).
    (ii) For transition training, except as provided in paragraph 
(c)(3)(iii) of this section, 10 hours in Group I reciprocating powered 
airplanes, 12 hours in Group I turbopropeller powered airplanes, 25 
hours for pilots in command in Group II airplanes, and 15 hours for 
second in command pilots in Group II airplanes. Operating experience in 
both airplane groups must include at least 4 operating cycles (at least 
2 as the pilot flying the airplane).

[[Page 517]]

    (iii) In the case of transition training where the certificate 
holder's approved training program includes a course of training in an 
airplane simulator under Sec. 121.409(c), each pilot in command must 
comply with the requirements prescribed in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this 
section for initial training.
    (d) A flight engineer must perform the duties of a flight engineer 
under the supervision of a check airman or a qualified flight engineer 
for at least the following number of hours:
    (1) Group I reciprocating powered airplanes, 8 hours.
    (2) Group I turbopropeller powered airplanes, 10 hours.
    (3) Group II airplanes, 12 hours.
    (e) A flight attendant must, for at least 5 hours, perform the 
assigned duties of a flight attendant under the supervision of a flight 
attendant supervisor qualified under this part who personally observes 
the performance of these duties. However, operating experience is not 
required for a flight attendant who has previously acquired such 
experience on any large passenger carrying airplane of the same group, 
if the certificate holder shows that the flight attendant has received 
sufficient ground training for the airplane in which the flight 
attendant is to serve. Flight attendants receiving operating experience 
may not be assigned as a required crewmember. Flight attendants who have 
satisfactorily completed training time acquired in an approved training 
program conducted in a full-scale (except for length) cabin training 
device of the type airplane in which they are to serve may substitute 
this time for 50 percent of the hours required by this paragraph.
    (f) Flight crewmembers may substitute one additional takeoff and 
landing for each hour of flight to meet the operating experience 
requirements of this section, up to a maximum reduction of 50% of flight 
hours, except those in Group II initial training, and second in command 
pilots in Group II transition training. Notwithstanding the reductions 
in programmed hours permitted under Sec. Sec. 121.405 and 121.409, the 
hours of operating experience for flight crewmembers are not subject to 
reduction other than as provided in this paragraph and paragraph (e) of 
this section.
    (g) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, pilot in 
command and second in command crewmembers must each acquire at least 100 
hours of line operating flight time for consolidation of knowledge and 
skills (including operating experience required under paragraph (c) of 
this section) within 120 days after the satisfactory completion of:
    (1) Any part of the flight maneuvers and procedures portion of 
either an airline transport pilot certificate with type rating practical 
test or an additional type rating practical test, or
    (2) A Sec. 121.441 proficiency check.
    (h) The following exceptions apply to the consolidation requirement 
of paragraph (g) of this section:
    (1) Pilots who have qualified and served as pilot in command or 
second in command on a particular type airplane in operations under this 
part before August 25, 1995 are not required to complete line operating 
flight time for consolidation of knowledge and skills.
    (2) Pilots who have completed the line operating flight time 
requirement for consolidation of knowledge and skills while serving as 
second in command on a particular type airplane in operations under this 
part after August 25, 1995 are not required to repeat the line operating 
flight time before serving as pilot in command on the same type 
airplane.
    (3) If, before completing the required 100 hours of line operating 
flight time, a pilot serves as a pilot in another airplane type operated 
by the certificate holder, the pilot may not serve as a pilot in the 
airplane for which the pilot has newly qualified unless the pilot 
satifactorily completes refresher training as provided in the 
certificate holder's approved training program and that training is 
conducted by an appropriately qualified instructor or check pilot.
    (4) If the required 100 hours of line operating flight time are not 
completed within 120 days, the certificate holder may extend the 120-day 
period to no more than 150 days if--
    (i) The pilot continues to meet all other applicable requirements of 
subpart O of this part; and

[[Page 518]]

    (ii) On or before the 120th day the pilot satisfactorily completes 
refresher training conducted by an appropriately qualified instructor or 
check pilot as provided in the certificate holder's approved training 
program, or a check pilot determines that the pilot has retained an 
adequate level of proficiency after observing that pilot in a supervised 
line operating flight.
    (5) The Administrator, upon application by the certificate holder, 
may authorize deviations from the requirements of paragraph (g) of this 
section, by an appropriate amendment to the operations specifications, 
to the extent warranted by any of the following circumstances:
    (i) A newly certificated certificate holder does not employ any 
pilots who meet the minimum requirements of paragraph (g) of this 
section.
    (ii) An existing certificate holder adds to its fleet an airplane 
type not before proven for use in its operations.
    (iii) A certificate holder establishes a new domicile to which it 
assigns pilots who will be required to become qualified on the airplanes 
operated from that domicile.
    (i) Notwithstanding the reductions in programmed hours permitted 
under Sec. Sec. 121.405 and 121.409 of subpart N of this part, the 
hours of operating experience for flight crewmembers are not subject to 
reduction other than as provided in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this 
section.

repeating the maneuvers failed, the person giving the proficiency check 
may require the pilot being checked to repeat any other maneuvers he 
finds are necessary to determine the pilot's proficiency. If the pilot 
being checked is unable to demonstrate satisfactory performance to the 
person conducting the check, the certificate holder may not use him nor 
may he serve in operations under this part until he has satisfactorily 
completed a proficiency check.

However, the entire proficiency check (other than the initial second-in-
command proficiency check) required by this section may be conducted in 
an approved visual simulator if the pilot being checked accomplishes at 
least two landings in the appropriate airplane during a line check or 
other check conducted by a pilot check airman (a pilot-in-command may 
observe and certify the satisfactory accomplishment of these landings by 
a second-in-command). If a pilot proficiency

[[Page 521]]

check is conducted in accordance with this paragraph, the next required 
proficiency check for that pilot must be conducted in the same manner, 
or in accordance with appendix F of this part, or a course of training 
in an airplane visual simulator under Sec. 121.409 may be substituted 
therefor.

Sec. 121.463  Aircraft dispatcher qualifications.

    (a) No certificate holder conducting domestic or flag operations may 
use any person, nor may any person serve, as an aircraft dispatcher for 
a particular airplane group unless that person has, with respect to an 
airplane of that group, satisfactorily completed the following:
    (1) Initial dispatcher training, except that a person who has 
satisfactorily completed such training for another type airplane of the 
same group need only complete the appropriate transition training.
    (2) Operating familiarization consisting of at least 5 hours 
observing operations under this part from the flight deck or, for 
airplanes without an observer seat on the flight deck, from a forward 
passenger seat with headset or speaker. This requirement may be reduced 
to a minimum of 2\1/2\ hours by the substitution of one additional 
takeoff and landing for an hour of flight. A person may serve as an 
aircraft dispatcher without meeting the requirement of this paragraph 
(a) for 90 days after initial introduction of the airplane into 
operations under this part.
    (b) No certificate holder conducting domestic or flag operations may 
use any person, nor may any person serve, as an aircraft dispatcher for 
a particular type airplane unless that person has, with respect to that 
airplane,

[[Page 524]]

satisfactorily completed differences training, if applicable.
    (c) No certificate holder conducting domestic or flag operations may 
use any person, nor may any person serve, as an aircraft dispatcher 
unless within the preceding 12 calendar months the aircraft dispatcher 
has satisfactorily completed operating familiarization consisting of at 
least 5 hours observing operations under this part, in one of the types 
of airplanes in each group to be dispatched. This observation shall be 
made from the flight deck or, for airplanes without an observer seat on 
the flight deck, from a forward passenger seat with headset or speaker. 
The requirement of paragraph (a) of this section may be reduced to a 
minimum of 2\1/2\ hours by the substitution of one additional takeoff 
and landing for an hour of flight. The requirement of this paragraph may 
be satisfied by observation of 5 hours of simulator training for each 
airplane group in one of the simulators approved under Sec. 121.407 for 
the group. However, if the requirement of paragraph (a) is met by the 
use of a simulator, no reduction in hours is permitted.
    (d) No certificate holder conducting domestic or flag operations may 
use any person, nor may any person serve as an aircraft dispatcher to 
dispatch airplanes in operations under this part unless the certificate 
holder has determined that he is familiar with all essential operating 
procedures for that segment of the operation over which he exercises 
dispatch jurisdiction. However, a dispatcher who is qualified to 
dispatch airplanes through one segment of an operation may dispatch 
airplanes through other segments of the operation after coordinating 
with dispatchers who are qualified to dispach airplanes through those 
other segments.
    (e) For the purposes of this section, the airplane groups, terms, 
and definitions in Sec. 121.400 apply.

<R05>
Sec. 121.465  Aircraft dispatcher duty time limitations: Domestic and 
flag operations.

    (a) Each certificate holder conducting domestic or flag operations 
shall establish the daily duty period for a dispatcher so that it begins 
at a time that allows him or her to become thoroughly familiar with 
existing and anticipated weather conditions along the route before he or 
she dispatches any airplane. He or she shall remain on duty until each 
airplane dispatched by him or her has completed its flight, or has gone 
beyond his or her jurisdiction, or until he or she is relieved by 
another qualified dispatcher.
    (b) Except in cases where circumstances or emergency conditions 
beyond the control of the certificate holder require otherwise--
    (1) No certificate holder conducting domestic or flag operations may 
schedule a dispatcher for more than 10 consecutive hours of duty;
    (2) If a dispatcher is scheduled for more than 10 hours of duty in 
24 consecutive hours, the certificate holder shall provide him or her a 
rest period of at least eight hours at or before the end of 10 hours of 
duty.
    (3) Each dispatcher must be relieved of all duty with the 
certificate holder for at least 24 consecutive hours during any seven 
consecutive days or the equivalent thereof within any calendar month.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a 
certificate holder conducting flag operations may, if authorized by the

    (a) For purposes of this section--
    Calendar day means the period of elapsed time, using Coordinated 
Universal Time or local time, that begins

[[Page 525]]

at midnight and ends 24 hours later at the next midnight.
    Duty period means the period of elapsed time between reporting for 
an assignment involving flight time and release from that assignment by 
the certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental 
operations. The time is calculated using either Coordinated Universal 
Time or local time to reflect the total elapsed time.
    Flight attendant means an individual, other than a flight 
crewmember, who is assigned by a certificate holder conducting domestic, 
flag, or supplemental operations, in accordance with the required 
minimum crew complement under the certificate holder's operations 
specifications or in addition to that minimum complement, to duty in an 
aircraft during flight time and whose duties include but are not 
necessarily limited to cabin-safety-related responsibilities.
    Rest period means the period free of all restraint or duty for a 
certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental operations 
and free of all responsibility for work or duty should the occasion 
arise.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a 
certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental operations 
may assign a duty period to a flight attendant only when the applicable 
duty period limitations and rest requirements of this paragraph are met.
    (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of 
this section, no certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or 
supplemental operations may assign a flight attendant to a scheduled 
duty period of more than 14 hours.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a flight 
attendant scheduled to a duty period of 14 hours or less as provided 
under paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be given a scheduled rest 
period of at least 9 consecutive hours. This rest period must occur 
between the completion of the scheduled duty period and the commencement 
of the subsequent duty period.
    (3) The rest period required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section 
may be scheduled or reduced to 8 consecutive hours if the flight 
attendant is provided a subsequent rest period of at least 10 
consecutive hours; this subsequent rest period must be scheduled to 
begin no later than 24 hours after the beginning of the reduced rest 
period and must occur between the completion of the scheduled duty 
period and the commencement of the subsequent duty period.
    (4) A certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental 
operations may assign a flight attendant to a scheduled duty period of 
more than 14 hours, but no more than 16 hours, if the certificate holder 
has assigned to the flight or flights in that duty period at least one 
flight attendant in addition to the minimum flight attendant complement 
required for the flight or flights in that duty period under the 
certificate holder's operations specifications.
    (5) A certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental 
operations may assign a flight attendant to a scheduled duty period of 
more than 16 hours, but no more than 18 hours, if the certificate holder 
has assigned to the flight or flights in that duty period at least two 
flight attendants in addition to the minimum flight attendant complement 
required for the flight or flights in that duty period under the 
certificate holder's operations specifications.
    (6) A certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental 
operations may assign a flight attendant to a scheduled duty period of 
more than 18 hours, but no more than 20 hours, if the scheduled duty 
period includes one or more flights that land or take off outside the 48 
contiguous states and the District of Columbia, and if the certificate 
holder has assigned to the flight or flights in that duty period at 
least three flight attendants in addition to the minimum flight 
attendant complement required for the flight or flights in that duty 
period under the domestic certificate holder's operations 
specifications.
    (7) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8) of this section, a flight 
attendant scheduled to a duty period of more than 14 hours but no more 
than 20 hours, as provided in paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of 
this section, must be

[[Page 526]]

given a scheduled rest period of at least 12 consecutive hours. This 
rest period must occur between the completion of the scheduled duty 
period and the commencement of the subsequent duty period.
    (8) The rest period required under paragraph (b)(7) of this section 
may be scheduled or reduced to 10 consecutive hours if the flight 
attendant is provided a subsequent rest period of at least 14 
consecutive hours; this subsequent rest period must be scheduled to 
begin no later than 24 hours after the beginning of the reduced rest 
period and must occur between the completion of the scheduled duty 
period and the commencement of the subsequent duty period.
    (9) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of this 
section, if a certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or 
supplemental operations elects to reduce the rest period to 10 hours as 
authorized by paragraph (b)(8) of this section, the certificate holder 
may not schedule a flight attendant for a duty period of more than 14 
hours during the 24-hour period commencing after the beginning of the 
reduced rest period.
    (10) No certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or 
supplemental operations may assign a flight attendant any duty period 
with the certificate holder unless the flight attendant has had at least 
the minimum rest required under this section.
    (11) No certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or 
supplemental operations may assign a flight attendant to perform any 
duty with the certificate holder during any required rest period.
    (12) Time spent in transportation, not local in character, that a 
certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental operations 
requires of a flight attendant and provides to transport the flight 
attendant to an airport at which that flight attendant is to serve on a 
flight as a crewmember, or from an airport at which the flight attendant 
was relieved from duty to return to the flight attendant's home station, 
is not considered part of a rest period.
    (13) Each certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or 
supplemental operations must relieve each flight attendant engaged in 
air transportation and each commercial operator must relieve each flight 
attendant engaged in air commerce from all further duty for at least 24 
consecutive hours during any 7 consecutive calendar days.
    (14) A flight attendant is not considered to be scheduled for duty 
in excess of duty period limitations if the flights to which the flight 
attendant is assigned are scheduled and normally terminate within the 
limitations but due to circumstances beyond the control of the 
certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental operations 
(such as adverse weather conditions) are not at the time of departure 
expected to reach their destination within the scheduled time.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, a certificate 
holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental operations may apply 
the flight crewmember flight time and duty limitations and rest 
requirements of this part to flight attendants for all operations 
conducted under this part provided that--
    (1) The certificate holder establishes written procedures that--
    (i) Apply to all flight attendants used in the certificate holder's 
operation;
    (ii) Include the flight crewmember requirements contained in 
subparts Q, R, or S of this part, as appropriate to the operation being 
conducted, except that rest facilities on board the aircraft are not 
required;
    (iii) Include provisions to add one flight attendant to the minimum 
flight attendant complement for each flight crewmember who is in excess 
of the minimum number required in the aircraft type certificate data 
sheet and who is assigned to the aircraft under the provisions of 
subparts Q, R, and S, as applicable, of this part;
    (iv) Are approved by the Administrator and are described or 
referenced in the certificate holder's operations specifications; and
    (2) Whenever the Administrator finds that revisions are necessary 
for the continued adequacy of the written procedures that are required 
by paragraph (c)(1) of this section and that had been granted final 
approval, the certificate holder must, after notification by the

[[Page 527]]

Administrator, make any changes in the procedures that are found 
necessary by the Administrator. Within 30 days after the certificate 
holder receives such notice, it may file a petition to reconsider the 
notice with the certificate-holding district office. The filing of a 
petition to reconsider stays the notice, pending decision by the 
Administrator. However, if the Administrator finds that an emergency 
requires immediate action in the interest of safety, the Administrator 
may, upon a statement of the reasons, require a change effective without 
stay.

Sec. 121.586  Authority to refuse transportation.

    (a) No certificate holder may refuse transportation to a passenger 
on the basis that, because the passenger may need the assistance of 
another person to move expeditiously to an exit in the event of an 
emergency, his transportation would or might be inimical to safety of 
flight unless--
    (1) The certificate holder has established procedures (including 
reasonable notice requirements) for the carriage of passengers who may 
need the assistance of another person to move expeditiously to an exit 
in the event of an emergency; and
    (2) At least one of the following conditions exist:
    (i) The passenger fails to comply with the notice requirements in 
the certificate holder's procedures.
    (ii) The passenger cannot be carried in accordance with the 
certificate holder's procedures.
    (b) Each certificate holder shall provide the certificate-holding 
district office with a copy of each procedure it establishes in 
accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (c) Whenever the Administrator finds that revisions in the 
procedures described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section are necessary 
in the interest of safety or in the public interest, the certificate 
holder, after notification by the Administrator, shall make those 
revisions in its procedures. Within 30 days after the certificate holder 
receives such notice, it may file a petition to reconsider the notice 
with the certificate-holding district office. The filing of a petition 
to reconsider stays the notice pending a decision by the Administrator. 
However, if the Administrator finds that there is an emergency that 
requires immediate action in the interest of safety in air commerce, he 
may, upon a statement of the reasons, require a change effective without 
stay.

    (2) Until December 9, 2005, an air carrier and a pilot being used by 
the air carrier in the conduct of domestic type operations and flag type 
operations, may operate an airplane designed for more than 9 but less 
than 31 passenger seats, at a land airport, in any State of the United 
States, the District of Columbia, or any territory or possession of the 
United States, that does not hold an airport operating certificate 
issued under part 139 of this chapter, and that serves small air carrier 
aircraft (as defined under ``Air carrier aircraft'' and ``Class III 
airport'' in Sec. 139.5 of this Chapter).
    (c) An air carrier and a pilot used by the air carrier in conducting 
a domestic type operation, flag type operation, or supplemental type 
operation may operate an airplane at an airport operated by the U.S. 
Government that is not certificated under part 139 of this chapter, only 
if that airport meets the equivalent--
    (1) Safety standards for airports certificated under part 139 of 
this chapter; and
    (2) Airport classification requirements under part 139 to serve the 
type airplane to be operated and the type of operation to be conducted.
    (d) An air carrier, a commercial operator, and a pilot being used by 
the air carrier or the commercial operator--when conducting a passenger-
carrying airplane operation under this part that is not a domestic type 
operation, a flag type operation, or a supplemental type operation--may 
operate at a land airport not certificated under part 139 of this 
chapter only when the following conditions are met:
    (1) The airport is adequate for the proposed operation, considering 
such items as size, surface, obstructions, and lighting.
    (2) For an airplane carrying passengers at night, the pilot may not 
take off from, or land at, an airport unless--
    (i) The pilot has determined the wind direction from an illuminated 
wind direction indicator or local ground communications or, in the case 
of takeoff, that pilot's personal observations; and
    (ii) The limits of the area to be used for landing or takeoff are 
clearly shown by boundary or runway marker lights. If the area to be 
used for takeoff or landing is marked by flare pots or lanterns, their 
use must be authorized by the Administrator.
    (e) A commercial operator and a pilot used by the commercial 
operator in conducting a domestic type operation, flag type operation, 
or supplemental type operation may operate an airplane at an airport 
operated by the U.S. Government that is not certificated under part 139 
of this chapter only if that airport meets the equivalent--
    (1) Safety standards for airports certificated under part 139 of 
this chapter; and
    (2) Airport classification requirements under part 139 of this 
chapter to serve the type airplane to be operated and the type of 
operation to be conducted.
    (f) For the purpose of this section, the terms--
    Domestic type operation means any domestic operation conducted 
with--
    (1) An airplane designed for at least 31 passenger seats (as 
determined by the aircraft type certificate issued by a

[[Page 551]]

competent civil aviation authority) at any land airport in any State of 
the United States, the District of Columbia, or any territory or 
possession of the United States; or
    (2) An airplane designed for more than 9 passenger seats but less 
than 31 passenger seats (as determined by the aircraft type certificate 
issued by a competent civil aviation authority) at any land airport in 
any State of the United States (except Alaska), the District of 
Columbia, or any territory or possession of the United States.
    Flag type operation means any flag operation conducted with--
    (1) An airplane designed for at least 31 passenger seats (as

aviation authority) at any land airport in any State of the United 
States, the District of Columbia, or any territory or possession of the 
United States; or
    (2) An airplane designed for more than 9 passenger seats but less 
than 31 passenger seats (as determined by the aircraft type certificate 
issued by a competent civil aviation authority) at any land airport in 
any State of the United States (except Alaska), the District of 
Columbia, or any territory or possession of the United States.
    Supplemental type operation means any supplemental operation (except 
an all-cargo operation) conducted with an airplane designed for at least 
31 passenger seats (as determined by the aircraft type certificate 
issued by a competent civil aviation authority) at any land airport in 
any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, or any 
territory or possession of the United States.
    United States means the States of the United States, the District of 
Columbia, and the territories and possessions of the United States.
    Note: Special Statutory Requirement to Operate to or From a Part 139 
Airport. Each air carrier that provides--in an aircraft (e.g., airplane, 
rotorcraft, etc.) designed for more than 9 passenger seats--regularly 
scheduled charter air transportation for which the public is provided in 
advance a schedule containing the departure location, departure time, 
and arrival location of the flight must operate to and from an airport 
certificated under part 139 of this chapter in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 
41104(b). That statutory provision contains stand-alone requirements for 
such air carriers and special exceptions for operations in Alaska and 
outside the United States. Nothing in Sec. 121.590 exempts the air 
carriers described in this note from the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 
41104(b). Certain operations by air carriers that conduct public charter 
operations under 14 CFR part 380 are covered by the statutory 
requirements to operate to and from part 139 airports. See 49 U.S.C. 
41104(b).

Sec. 121.629  Operation in icing conditions.

    (a) No person may dispatch or release an aircraft, continue to 
operate an aircraft en route, or land an aircraft when in the opinion of 
the pilot in command or aircraft dispatcher (domestic and flag 
operations only), icing conditions are expected or met that might 
adversely affect the safety of the flight.
    (b) No person may take off an aircraft when frost, ice, or snow is 
adhering to the wings, control surfaces, propellers, engine inlets, or 
other critical surfaces of the aircraft or when the takeoff would not be 
in compliance with paragraph (c) of this section.

[[Page 556]]

Takeoffs with frost under the wing in the area of the fuel tanks may be 
authorized by the Administrator.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, no person 
may dispatch, release, or take off an aircraft any time conditions are 
such that frost, ice, or snow may reasonably be expected to adhere to 
the aircraft, unless the certificate holder has an approved ground 
deicing/anti-icing program in its operations specifications and unless 
the dispatch, release, and takeoff comply with that program. The 
approved ground deicing/anti-icing program must include at least the 
following items:
    (1) A detailed description of--
    (i) How the certificate holder determines that conditions are such 
that frost, ice, or snow may reasonably be expected to adhere to the 
aircraft and that ground deicing/anti-icing operational procedures must 
be in effect;
    (ii) Who is responsible for deciding that ground deicing/anti-icing 
operational procedures must be in effect;
    (iii) The procedures for implementing ground deicing/anti-icing 
operational procedures;
    (iv) The specific duties and responsibilities of each operational 
position or group responsible for getting the aircraft safely airborne 
while ground deicing/anti-icing operational procedures are in effect.
    (2) Initial and annual recurrent ground training and testing for 
flight crewmembers and qualification for all other affected personnel 
(e.g., aircraft dispatchers, ground crews, contract personnel) 
concerning the specific requirements of the approved program and each 
person's responsibilities and duties under the approved program, 
specifically covering the following areas:
    (i) The use of holdover times.
    (ii) Aircraft deicing/anti-icing procedures, including inspection 
and check procedures and responsibilities.
    (iii) Communications procedures.
    (iv) Aircraft surface contamination (i.e., adherence of frost, ice, 
or snow) and critical area identification, and how contamination 
adversely affects aircraft performance and flight characteristics.
    (v) Types and characteristics of deicing/anti-icing fluids.
    (vi) Cold weather preflight inspection procedures;
    (vii) Techniques for recognizing contamination on the aircraft.
    (3) The certificate holder's holdover timetables and the procedures 
for the use of these tables by the certificate holder's personnel. 
Holdover time is the estimated time deicing/anti-icing fluid will 
prevent the formation of frost or ice and the accumulation of snow on 
the protected surfaces of an aircraft. Holdover time begins when the 
final application of deicing/anti-icing fluid commences and expires when 
the deicing/anti-icing fluid applied to the aircraft loses its 
effectiveness. The holdover times must be supported by data acceptable 
to the Administrator. The certificate holder's program must include 
procedures for flight crewmembers to increase or decrease the determined 
holdover time in changing conditions. The program must provide that 
takeoff after exceeding any maximum holdover time in the certificate 
holder's holdover timetable is permitted only when at least one of the 
following conditions exists:
    (i) A pretakeoff contamination check, as defined in paragraph (c)(4) 
of this section, determines that the wings, control surfaces, and other 
critical surfaces, as defined in the certificate holder's program, are 
free of frost, ice, or snow.
    (ii) It is otherwise determined by an alternate procedure approved 
by the Administrator in accordance with the certificate holder's 
approved program that the wings, control surfaces, and other critical 
surfaces, as defined in the certificate holder's program, are free of 
frost, ice, or snow.
    (iii) The wings, control surfaces, and other critical surfaces are 
redeiced and a new holdover time is determined.
    (4) Aircraft deicing/anti-icing procedures and responsibilities, 
pretakeoff check procedures and responsibilities, and pretakeoff 
contamination check procedures and responsibilities. A pretakeoff check 
is a check of the aircraft's wings or representative aircraft surfaces 
for frost, ice, or snow within the aircraft's holdover time. A 
pretakeoff contamination check is a check

[[Page 557]]

to make sure the wings, control surfaces, and other critical surfaces, 
as defined in the certificate holder's program, are free of frost, ice, 
and snow. It must be conducted within five minutes prior to beginning 
take off. This check must be accomplished from outside the aircraft 
unless the program specifies otherwise.
    (d) A certificate holder may continue to operate under this section 
without a program as required in paragraph (c) of this section, if it 
includes in its operations specifications a requirement that, any time 
conditions are such that frost, ice, or snow may reasonably be expected 
to adhere to the aircraft, no aircraft will take off unless it has been 
checked to ensure that the wings, control surfaces, and other critical 
surfaces are free of frost, ice, and snow. The check must occur within 
five minutes prior to beginning takeoff. This check must be accomplished 
from outside the aircraft.

it has been dispatched or released unless the weather conditions at an 
alternate airport that was specified in the dispatch or flight release 
are forecast to be at or above the alternate minimums specified in the 
operations specifications for that airport at the time the aircraft 
would arrive at the alternate airport. However, the dispatch or flight 
release may be amended en route to include any alternate airport that is 
within the fuel range of the aircraft as specified in Sec. Sec. 121.639 
through 121.647.
    (c) No person may change an original destination or alternate 
airport that is specified in the original dispatch or flight release to 
another airport while the aircraft is en route unless the other airport 
is authorized for that type of aircraft and the appropriate requirements 
of Sec. Sec. 121.593 through 121.661 and 121.173 are met at the time of 
redispatch or amendment of the flight release.

Sec. 121.651  Takeoff and landing weather minimums: IFR: All certificate 
holders.

    (a) Notwithstanding any clearance from ATC, no pilot may begin a 
takeoff in an airplane under IFR when the weather conditions reported by 
the U.S. National Weather Service, a source approved by that Service, or 
a source approved by the Administrator, are less than those specified 
in--
    (1) The certificate holder's operations specifications; or
    (2) Parts 91 and 97 of this chapter, if the certificate holder's 
operations specifications do not specify takeoff minimums for the 
airport.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, no pilot 
may continue an approach past the final approach fix, or where a final 
approach fix is not used, begin the final approach segment of an 
instrument approach procedure--
    (1) At any airport, unless the U.S. National Weather Service, a 
source approved by that Service, or a source approved by the 
Administrator, issues a weather report for that airport; and
    (2) At airports within the United States and its territories or at 
U.S. military airports, unless the latest weather report for that 
airport issued by the U.S. National Weather Service, a source approved 
by that Service, or a source approved by the Administrator, reports the 
visibility to be equal to or more than the visibility minimums 
prescribed for that procedure. For the purpose of this section, the term 
``U.S. military airports'' means airports in foreign countries where 
flight operations are under the control of U.S. military authority.
    (c) If a pilot has begun the final approach segment of an instrument 
approach procedure in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, and 
after that receives a later weather report indicating below-minimum 
conditions, the pilot may continue the approach to DH or MDA. Upon 
reaching DH or at MDA, and at any time before the missed approach point, 
the pilot may continue the approach below DH or MDA if either the 
requirements of Sec. 91.175(l) of this chapter, or the following 
requirements are met:
    (1) The aircraft is continuously in a position from which a descent 
to a landing on the intended runway can be made at a normal rate of 
descent using normal maneuvers, and where that descent rate will allow 
touchdown to occur within the touchdown zone of the runway of intended 
landing;
    (2) The flight visibility is not less than the visibility prescribed 
in the standard instrument approach procedure being used;
    (3) Except for Category II or Category III approaches where any 
necessary visual reference requirements are specified by authorization 
of the Administrator, at least one of the following visual references 
for the intended runway is distinctly visible and identifiable to the 
pilot:
    (i) The approach light system, except that the pilot may not descend 
below 100 feet above the touchdown zone elevation using the approach 
lights as a reference unless the red terminating bars or the red side 
row bars are also distinctly visible and identifiable.
    (ii) The threshold.
    (iii) The threshold markings.
    (iv) The threshold lights.
    (v) The runway end identifier lights.
    (vi) The visual approach slope indicator.
    (vii) The touchdown zone or touchdown zone markings.
    (viii) The touchdown zone lights.
    (ix) The runway or runway markings.
    (x) The runway lights; and
    (4) When the aircraft is on a straight-in nonprecision approach 
procedure which incorporates a visual descent point, the aircraft has 
reached the visual descent point, except where the aircraft is not 
equipped for or capable of establishing that point, or a descent to the 
runway cannot be made using normal procedures or rates of descent if 
descent is delayed until reaching that point.
    (d) A pilot may begin the final approach segment of an instrument 
approach procedure other than a Category II or Category III procedure at 
an airport when the visibility is less than the visibility minimums 
prescribed for that procedure if that airport is served by an operative 
ILS and an operative PAR, and both are used by

the pilot. However, no pilot may continue an approach below the 
authorized DH unless the requirements of Sec. 91.175(l) of this 
chapter, or the following requirements are met:
    (1) The aircraft is continuously in a position from which a descent 
to a landing on the intended runway can be made at a normal rate of 
descent using normal maneuvers and where such a descent rate will allow 
touchdown to occur within the touchdown zone of the runway of intended 
landing;
    (2) The flight visibility is not less than the visibility prescribed 
in the standard instrument approach procedure being used; and
    (3) Except for Category II or Category III approaches where any 
necessary visual reference requirements are specified by the 
authorization of the Administrator, at least one of the following visual 
references for the intended runway is distinctly visible and 
identifiable to the pilot:
    (i) The approach light system, except that the pilot may not descend 
below 100 feet above the touchdown zone elevation using the approach 
lights as a reference unless the red terminating bars or the red side 
row bars are also distinctly visible and identifiable.
    (ii) The threshold.
    (iii) The threshold markings.
    (iv) The threshold lights.

    (x) The runway lights.
    (e) For the purpose of this section, the final approach segment 
begins at the final approach fix or facility prescribed in the 
instrument approach procedure. When a final approach fix is not 
prescribed for a procedure that includes a procedure turn, the final 
approach segment begins at the point where the procedure turn is 
completed and the aircraft is established inbound toward the airport on 
the final approach course within the distance prescribed in the 
procedure.
    (f) Unless otherwise authorized in the certificate holder's 
operations specifications, each pilot making an IFR takeoff, approach, 
or landing at a foreign airport shall comply with the applicable 
instrument approach procedures and weather minimums prescribed by the 
authority having jurisdiction over the airport.

Sec. 121.652  Landing weather minimums: IFR: All certificate holders.

    (a) If the pilot in command of an airplane has not served 100 hours 
as pilot in command in operations under this part in the type of 
airplane he is operating, the MDA or DH and visibility landing minimums 
in the certificate holder's operations specification for regular, 
provisional, or refueling airports are increased by 100 feet and one-
half mile (or the RVR equivalent). The MDA or DH and visibility minimums 
need not be increased above those applicable to the airport when used as 
an alternate airport, but in no event may the landing minimums be less 
than 300 and 1. However, a Pilot in command employed by a certificate 
holder conducting operations in large aircraft under part 135 of this 
chapter, may credit flight time acquired in operations conducted for 
that operator under part 91 in the same type airplane for up to 50 
percent of the 100 hours of pilot in command experience required by this 
paragraph.
    (b) The 100 hours of pilot in command experience required by 
paragraph (a) of this section may be reduced (not to exceed 50 percent) 
by substituting one landing in operations under this part in the type of 
airplane for 1 required hour of pilot in command experience, if the 
pilot has at least 100 hours as pilot in command of another type 
airplane in operations under this part.
    (c) Category II minimums and the sliding scale when authorized in 
the certificate holder's operations specifications do not apply until 
the pilot in command subject to paragraph (a) of this section meets the 
requirements of that paragraph in the type of airplane he is operating.

Sec. 121.653  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 121.655  Applicability of reported weather minimums.

    In conducting operations under Sec. Sec. 121.649 through 121.653, 
the ceiling and visibility values in the main body of the latest weather 
report control for VFR and IFR takeoffs and landings and for instrument 
approach procedures on all runways of an airport. However, if the latest 
weather report, including an oral report from the control tower, 
contains a visibility value specified as runway visibility or runway 
visual range for a particular runway of an airport, that specified value 
controls for VFR and IFR landings and takeoffs and straight-in 
instrument approaches for that runway.


<R05>
Sec. 121.657  Flight altitude rules.

    (a) General. Notwithstanding Sec. 91.119 or any rule applicable 
outside the United States, no person may operate an aircraft below the 
minimums set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, except 
when necessary for takeoff or landing, or except when, after considering 
the character of the terrain, the quality and quantity of meteorological 
services, the navigational facilities available, and other flight 
conditions, the Administrator prescribes other minimums for any route or 
part of a route where he finds that the safe conduct of the flight 
requires other altitudes. Outside of the United States the minimums 
prescribed in this section are controlling unless higher minimums are 
prescribed in the certificate holder's operations specifications or by 
the foreign country over which the aircraft is operating.
    (b) Day VFR operations. No certificate holder conducting domestic 
operations may operate a passenger-carrying aircraft and no certificate 
holder conducting flag or supplemental operations may operate any 
aircraft under VFR during the day at an altitude less than 1,000 feet 
above the surface or less than 1,000 feet from any mountain, hill, or 
other obstruction to flight.
    (c) Night VFR, IFR, and over-the-top operations. No person may 
operate an aircraft under IFR including over-the-top or at night under 
VFR at an altitude less than 1,000 feet above the highest obstacle 
within a horizontal distance of five miles from the center of the 
intended course, or, in designated mountainous areas, less than 2,000 
feet above the highest obstacle within a horizontal distance of five 
miles from the center of the intended course.
    (d) Day over-the-top operations below minimum en route altitudes. A 
person may conduct day over-the-top operations in an airplane at flight 
altitudes lower than the minimum en route IFR altitudes if--
    (1) The operation is conducted at least 1,000 feet above the top of 
lower broken or overcast cloud cover;
    (2) The top of the lower cloud cover is generally uniform and level;
    (3) Flight visibility is at least five miles; and
    (4) The base of any higher broken or overcast cloud cover is 
generally uniform and level and is at least 1,000 feet above the minimum 
en route IFR altitude for that route segment.

Sec. 121.659  Initial approach altitude: Domestic and supplemental 
operations.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, when making 
an initial approach to a radio navigation facility under IFR, no person 
may descend an aircraft below the pertinent minimum altitude for initial 
approach (as specified in the instrument approach procedure for that 
facility) until his arrival over that facility has been definitely 
established.
    (b) When making an initial approach on a flight being conducted 
under Sec. 121.657(d), no pilot may commence an instrument approach 
until his arrival over the radio facility has definitely been 
established. In making an instrument approach under these circumstances 
no person may descend an aircraft lower than 1,000 feet above the top of 
the lower cloud or the minimum altitude determined by the Administrator 
for that part of the IFR approach, whichever is lower.

Sec. 121.665  Load manifest.

    Each certificate holder is responsible for the preparation and 
accuracy of a load manifest form before each take off. The form must be 
prepared and signed for each flight by employees of the certificate 
holder who have the duty of supervising the loading of aircraft and 
preparing the load manifest forms or by other qualified persons 
authorized by the certificate holder.


<R05>
Sec. 121.667  Flight plan: VFR and IFR: Supplemental operations.

    (a) No person may take off an aircraft unless the pilot in command 
has filed a flight plan, containing the appropriate information required 
by part 91, with the nearest FAA communication station or appropriate 
military station or, when operating outside the United States, with 
other appropriate authority. However, if communications facilities are 
not readily available, the pilot in command shall file the flight plan 
as soon as practicable after the aircraft is airborne. A flight plan 
must continue in effect for all parts of the flight.
    (b) When flights are operated into military airports, the arrival or 
completion notice required by Sec. Sec. 91.153 and 91.169 may be filed 
with the appropriate airport control tower or aeronautical communication 
facility used for that airport.

      Appendix C to Part 121--C-46 Nontransport Category Airplanes

                            Cargo Operations

    1. Required engines. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section, the engines specified in subparagraphs (1) or (2) of this 
section must be installed in C-46 nontransport category airplanes 
operated at gross weights exceeding 45,000 pounds:
    (1) Pratt and Whitney R2800-51-M1 or R2800-75-M1 engines (engines 
converted from basic model R2800-51 or R2800-75 engines in accordance 
with FAA approved data) that--
    (i) Conform to Engine Specification 5E-8;
    (ii) Conform to the applicable portions of the operator's manual;
    (iii) Comply with all the applicable airworthiness directives; and
    (iv) Are equipped with high capacity oil pump drive gears in 
accordance with FAA approved data.
    (2) Other engines found acceptable by the FAA Regional Flight 
Standards Division having type certification responsibility for the C-46 
airplane.
    (b) Upon application by an operator conducting cargo operations with 
nontransport category C-46 airplanes between points within the State of 
Alaska, the appropriate FAA Flight Standards District Office, Alaskan

[[Page 576]]

Region, may authorize the operation of such airplanes, between points 
within the State of Alaska; without compliance with paragraph (a) of 
this section if the operator shows that, in its area of operation, 
installation of the modified engines is not necessary to provide 
adequate cooling for single-engine operations. Such authorization and 
any conditions or limitations therefor is made a part of the Operations 
Specifications of the operator.
    2. Minimum acceptable means of complying with the special 
airworthiness requirements. Unless otherwise authorized under Sec. 
121.213, the data set forth in sections 3 through 34 of this appendix, 
as correlated to the C-46 nontransport category airplane, is the minimum 
means of compliance with the special airworthiness requirements of 
Sec. Sec. 121.215 through 121.281.
    3. Susceptibility of material to fire. [Deleted as unnecessary]
    4. Cabin interiors. C-46 crew compartments must meet all the 
requirements of Sec. 121.215, and, as required in Sec. 121.221, the 
door between the crew compartment and main cabin (cargo) compartment 
must be flame resistant.
    5. Internal doors. Internal doors, including the crew to main cabin 
door, must meet all the requirements of Sec. 121.217.
    6. Ventilation. Standard C-46 crew compartments meet the ventilation 
requirements of Sec. 121.219 if a means of ventilation for controlling 
the flow of air is available between the crew compartment and main 
cabin. The ventilation requirement may be met by use of a door between 
the crew compartment and main cabin. The door need not have louvers 
installed; however, if louvers are installed, they must be controllable.
    7. Fire precautions. Compliance is required with all the provisions 
of Sec. 121.221.
    (a) In establishing compliance with this section, the C-46 main 
cabin is considered as a Class A compartment if--
    (1) The operator utilizes a standard system of cargo loading and 
tiedown that allows easy access in flight to all cargo in such 
compartment, and, such system is included in the appropriate portion of 
the operator's manual; and
    (2) A cargo barrier is installed in the forward end of the main 
cabin cargo compartment. The barrier must--
    (i) Establish the most forward location beyond which cargo cannot be 
carried;
    (ii) Protect the components and systems of the airplane that are 
essential to its safe operation from cargo damage; and
    (iii) Permit easy access, in flight, to cargo in the main cabin 
cargo compartment.

The barrier may be a cargo net or a network of steel cables or other 
means acceptable to the Administrator which would provide equivalent 
protection to that of a cargo net. The barrier need not meet crash load 
requirements of FAR Sec. 25.561; however, it must be attached to the 
cargo retention fittings and provide the degree of cargo retention that 
is required by the operators' standard system of cargo loading and 
tiedown.
    (b) C-46 forward and aft baggage compartments must meet, as a 
minimum, Class B requirements of this section or be placarded in a 
manner to preclude their use as cargo or baggage compartments.
    8. Proof of compliance. The demonstration of compliance required by 
Sec. 121.223 is not required for C-46 airplanes in which--
    (1) The main cabin conforms to Class A cargo compartment 
requirements of Sec. 121.219; and
    (2) Forward and aft baggage compartments conform to Class B 
requirements of Sec. 121.221, or are placarded to preclude their use as 
cargo or baggage compartments.
    9. Propeller deicing fluid. No change from the requirements of Sec. 
121.225. Isopropyl alcohol is a combustible fluid within the meaning of 
this section.
    10. Pressure cross-feed arrangements, location of fuel tanks, and 
fuel system lines and fittings. C-46 fuel systems which conform to all 
applicable Curtiss design specifications and which comply with the FAA 
type certification requirements are in compliance with the provisions of 
Sec. Sec. 121.227 through 121.231.
    11. Fuel lines and fittings in designated fire zones. No change from 
the requirements of Sec. 121.233.
    12. Fuel valves. Compliance is required with all the provisions of 
Sec. 121.235. Compliance can be established by showing that the fuel 
system conforms to all the applicable Curtiss design specifications, the 
FAA type certification requirements, and, in addition, has explosion-

    (2) Drain lines from supercharger case, engine-driven fuel pump, and 
engine-driven hydraulic pump reach into the scupper drain located in the 
lower cowling segment.
    (b) Combustion heater compartment. C-46 heater compartments meet the 
requirements of Sec. 121.261 if they conform to AD-49-18-1 or FAA 
approved equivalent.
    25. Fire-extinguishing system. (a) To meet the requirements of Sec. 
121.263, C-46 airplanes must have installed fire extinguishing systems 
to serve all designated fire zones. The fire-extinguishing systems, the 
quantity of extinguishing agent, and the rate of discharge shall be such 
as to provide a minimum of one adequate discharge for each designated 
fire zone. Compliance with this provision requires the installation of a 
separate fire extinguisher for each engine compartment. Insofar as the 
engine compartment is concerned, the system shall be capable of 
protecting the entire compartment against the various types of fires 
likely to occur in the compartment.
    (b) Fire-extinguishing systems which conform to the C-46 transport 
category requirements meet the requirements set forth in

[[Page 578]]

paragraph (a). Furthermore, fire-extinguishing systems for combustion

an FAA approved equivalent also meet the requirements in paragraph (a).
    In addition, a fire-extinguishing system for C-46 airplanes meets 
the adequacy requirement of paragraph (a) if it provides the same or 
equivalent protection to that demonstrated by the CAA in tests conducted 
in 1941 and 1942, using a CW-20 type engine nacelle (without diaphragm). 
These tests were conducted at the Bureau of Standards facilities in 
Washington, DC, and copies of the test reports are available through the 
FAA Regional Engineering Offices. In this connection, the flow rates and 
distribution of extinguishing agent substantiated in American Airmotive 
Report No. 128-52-d, FAA approved February 9, 1953, provides protection 
equivalent to that demonstrated by the CAA in the CW-20 tests. In 
evaluating any C-46 fire-extinguishing system with respect to the 
aforementioned CW-20 tests, the Administration would require data in a 
narrative form, utilizing drawings or photographs to show at least the 
following:
    Installation of containers; installation and routing of plumbing; 
type, number, and location of outlets or nozzles; type, total volume, 
and distribution of extinguishing agent; length of time required for 
discharging; means for thermal relief, including type and location of 
discharge indicators; means of discharging, e.g., mechanical 
cutterheads, electric cartridge, or other method; and whether a one- or 
two-shot system is used; and if the latter is used, means of cross-
feeding or otherwise selecting distribution of extinguishing agent; and 
types of materials used in makeup of plumbing.
    High rate discharge (HRD) systems using agents such as 
bromotrifluoromethane, dibrodifluoromethane and chlorobromomethane (CB), 
may also meet the requirements of paragraph (a).
    26. Fire-extinguishing agents, Extinguishing agent container 
pressure relief, Extinguishing agent container compartment temperatures, 
and Fire-extinguishing system materials. No change from the requirements 
of Sec. Sec. 121.265 through 121.271.
    27. Fire-detector system. Compliance with the requirements of Sec.

compartments
    28. Fire detectors. No change from the requirements of Sec. 
121.275.
    29. Protection of other airplane components against fire. To meet 
the requirements of Sec. 121.277, C-46 airplanes must--
    (a) Conform to the type design and all applicable airworthiness 
directives; and
    (b) Be modified or have operational procedures established to 
provide additional fire protection for the wheel well door aft of each 
engine compartment. Modifications may consist of improvements in sealing 
of the main landing gear wheel well doors. An operational procedure 
which is acceptable to the Agency is one requiring the landing gear 
control to be placed in the up position in case of in-flight engine 
fire. In accordance with Sec. 121.315, such procedure must be set forth 
in the emergency portion of the operator's emergency checklist 
pertaining to in-flight engine fire.

    Appendix D to Part 121--Criteria for Demonstration of Emergency 
                Evacuation Procedures Under Sec. 121.291

    (a) Aborted takeoff demonstration. (1) The demonstration must be 
conducted either during the dark of the night or during daylight with 
the dark of the night simulated. If the demonstration is conducted 
indoors during daylight hours, it must be conducted with each window 
covered and each door closed to minimize the daylight effect. 
Illumination on the floor or ground may be used, but it must be kept low 
and shielded against shining into the airplane's windows or doors.
    (2) The airplane must be a normal ground attitude with landing gear 
extended.
    (3) Unless the airplane is equipped with an off-wing descent means, 
stands or ramps may be used for descent from the wing to the ground. 
Safety equipment such as mats or inverted life rafts may be placed on 
the floor or ground to protect participants. No other equipment that is 
not part of the emergency evacuation equipment of the airplane may be 
used to aid the participants in reaching the ground.
    (4) The airplane's normal electrical power sources must be 
deenergized.
    (5) All emergency equipment for the type of passenger-carrying 
operation involved must be installed in accordance with the certificate 
holder's manual.
    (6) Each external door and exit, and each internal door or curtain 
must be in position to simulate a normal takeoff.
    (7) A representative passenger load of persons in normal health must 
be used. At least 40 percent of the passenger load must be females. At 
least 35 percent of the passenger load must be over 50 years of age. At 
least 15 percent of the passenger load must be female and over 50 year 
of age. Three life-size dolls, not included as part of the total 
passenger load, must be carried by passengers to simulate live infants 2 
years old or younger. Crewmembers, mechanics, and training personnel, 
who maintain or operate the airplane in the normal course of their 
duties, may not be used as passengers.
    (8) No passenger may be assigned a specific seat except as the 
Administrator may require. Except as required by item (12) of this 
paragraph, no employee of the certificate holder may be seated next to 
an emergency exit.
    (9) Seat belts and shoulder harnesses (as required) must be 
fastened.
    (10) Before the start of the demonstration, approximately one-half 
of the total average amount of carry-on baggage, blankets, pillows, and 
other similar articles must be distributed at several locations in the 
aisles and emergency exit access ways to create minor obstructions.
    (11) The seating density and arrangement of the airplane must be 
representative of the highest capacity passenger version of that 
airplane the certificate holder operates or proposes to operate.
    (12) Each crewmember must be a member of a regularly scheduled line 
crew, except that flight crewmembers need not be members of a regularly 
scheduled line crew, provided they have knowledge of the airplane. Each 
crewmember must be seated in the seat the crewmember is normally 
assigned for takeoff, and must remain in that seat until the signal for 
commencement of the demonstration is received.
    (13) No crewmember or passenger may be given prior knowledge of the 
emergency exits available for the demonstration.
    (14) The certificate holder may not practice, rehearse, or describe 
the demonstration for the participants nor may any participant have 
taken part in this type of demonstration within the preceding 6 months.
    (15) The pretakeoff passenger briefing required by Sec. 121.571 may 
be given in accordance with the certificate holder's manual. The 
passengers may also be warned to follow directions of crewmembers, but 
may not be instructed on the procedures to be followed in the 
demonstration.
    (16) If safety equipment as allowed by item (3) of this section is 
provided, either all passenger and cockpit windows must be blacked out 
or all of the emergency exits must have safety equipment in order to 
prevent disclosure of the available emergency exits.
    (17) Not more than 50 percent of the emergency exits in the sides of 
the fuselage of an airplane that meet all of the requirements applicable 
to the required emergency exits for that airplane may be used for the 
demonstration. Exits that are not to be used in the demonstration must 
have the exit handle deactivated or must be indicated by red lights, red 
tape, or other acceptable means, placed outside the exits to indicate 
fire or other reason that they are unusable. The exits to be used must 
be representative of all of the emergency exits on the airplane and must 
be designated by the certificate holder, subject to approval by the 
Administrator. At least one floor level exit must be used.
    (18) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this appendix, all 
evacuees must leave the airplane by a means provided as part of the 
airplane's equipment.
    (19) The certificate holder's approved procedures and all of the 
emergency equipment that is normally available, including slides, ropes, 
lights, and megaphones, must be fully utilized during the demonstration, 
except that the flightcrew must take no active role in assisting others 
inside the cabin during the demonstration.
    (20) The evacuation time period is completed when the last occupant 
has evacuated the airplane and is on the ground. Evacuees

[[Page 597]]

using stands or ramps allowed by item (3) above are considered to be on 
the ground when they are on the stand or ramp: Provided, That the 
acceptance rate of the stand or ramp is no greater than the acceptance 
rate of the means available on the airplane for descent from the wing 
during an actual crash situation.
    (b) Ditching demonstration. The demonstration must assume that 
daylight hours exist outside the airplane, and that all required 
crewmembers are available for the demonstration.
    (1) If the certificate holder's manual requires the use of 
passengers to assist in the launching of liferafts, the needed 
passengers must be aboard the airplane and participate in the 
demonstration according to the manual.
    (2) A stand must be placed at each emergency exit and wing, with the 
top of the platform at a height simulating the water level of the 
airplane following a ditching.
    (3) After the ditching signal has been received, each evacuee must 
don a life vest according to the certificate holder's manual.
    (4) Each liferaft must be launched and inflated, according to the 
certificate holder's manual, and all other required emergency equipment 
must be placed in rafts.
    (5) Each evacuee must enter a liferaft, and the crewmembers assigned 
to each liferaft must indicate the location of emergency equipment 
aboard the raft and describe its use.
    (6) Either the airplane, a mockup of the airplane or a floating 
device simulating a passenger compartment must be used.
    (i) If a mockup of the airplane is used, it must be a life-size 
mockup of the interior and representative of the airplane currently used 
by or proposed to be used by the certificate holder, and must contain 
adequate seats for use of the evacuees. Operation of the emergency exits 
and the doors must closely simulate those on the airplane. Sufficient 
wing area must be installed outside the over-the-wing exits to 
demonstrate the evacuation.
    (ii) If a floating device simulating a passenger compartment is 
used, it must be representative, to the extent possible, of the 
passenger compartment of the airplane used in operations. Operation of 
the emergency exits and the doors must closely simulate operation on 
that airplane. Sufficient wing area must be installed outside the over-
the-wing exits to demonstrate the evacuation. The device must be 
equipped with the same survival equipment as is installed on the 
airplane, to accommodate all persons participating in the demonstration.

          Appendix E to Part 121--Flight Training Requirements

    The maneuvers and procedures required by Sec. 121.424 of this part 
for pilot initial, transition, and upgrade flight training are set forth 
in the certificate holder's approved low-altitude windshear flight 
training program and in this appendix and must be performed inflight 
except that windshear maneuvers and procedures must be performed in an 
airplane simulator in which the maneuvers and procedures are 
specifically authorized to be accomplished and except to the extent that 
certain other maneuvers and procedures may be performed in an airplane 
simulator with a visual system (visual simulator), an airplane simulator 
without a visual system (nonvisual simulator), a training device, or a 
static airplane as indicated by the appropriate symbol in the respective 
column opposite the maneuver or procedure.
    Whenever a maneuver or procedure is authorized to be performed in a 
nonvisual simulator, it may be performed in a visual simulator; when 
authorized in a training device, it may be performed in a visual or 
nonvisual simulator, and in some cases, a static airplane. Whenever the 
requirement may be performed in either a training device or a static 
airplane, the appropriate symbols are entered in the respective columns.
    For the purpose of this appendix, the following symbols mean--
 P=Pilot in Command (PIC).
 S=Second in Command (SIC).
 B=PIC and SIC.
 F=Flight Engineer.
PJ=PIC transition Jet to Jet.
PP=PIC transition Prop. to Prop.
SJ=SIC transition Jet to Jet.
SP=SIC transition Prop. to Prop.
AT=All transition categories (PJ, PP, SJ, SP).
PS=SIC upgrading to PIC (same airplane).
SF=Flight Engineer upgrading to SIC (same airplane).
BU=Both SIC and Flight Engineer upgrading (same airplane).

   In making this determination, the
   Administrator determines whether training
   on slats only and partial flap approaches
   is necessary.
  (p) Missed approaches which include the
   following:
    (1) Missed approaches from ILS            ................  ................  B...............  ................  ................  ................  ................

         Appendix F to Part 121--Proficiency Check Requirements

    The maneuvers and procedures required by Sec. 121.441 for pilot 
proficiency checks are set forth in this appendix and must be performed 
inflight except to the extent that certain maneuvers and procedures may 
be performed in an airplane simulator with a visual system (visual 
simulator), an airplane simulator without a visual system (nonvisual 
simulator), or a training device as indicated by the appropriate symbol 
in the respective column opposite the maneuver or procedure.
    Whenever a maneuver or procedure is authorized to be performed in a 
nonvisual simulator, it may also be performed in a visual simulator; 
when authorized in a training device, it may be performed in a visual or 
nonvisual simulator.
    For the purpose of this appendix, the following symbols mean--
P=Pilot in Command.
B=Both Pilot in Command and Second in Command.
*=A symbol and asterisk (B*) indicates that a particular condition is 
specified in the maneuvers and procedures column.
<greek-i>=When a maneuver is preceded by this symbol it indicates the 
maneuver may be required in the airplane at the discretion of the person 
conducting the check.
    Throughout the maneuvers prescribed in this appendix, good judgment 
commensurate with a high level of safety must be demonstrated. In 
determining whether such judgment has been shown, the person conducting 
the check considers adherence to approved procedures, actions based on 
analysis of situations for which there is no prescribed procedure or 
recommended practice, and qualities of prudence and care in selecting a 
course of action.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                              Required                         Permitted

[[Page 606]]

 
Except for flight checks required by Sec. 121.424(d)(2), an approved pictorial means
 that realistically portrays the location and detail of preflight inspection items and
 provides for the portrayal of abnormal conditions may be substituted for the
 preflight inspection. If a flight engineer is a required flight crewmember for the
 particular type airplane, the visual inspection may be waived under Sec. 121.441(d)
  (c) Taxiing. This maneuver includes taxiing (in the case of a second in command       ..........        B   .........  .........  ........  ..........

   critical powerplant--..............................................................
    (1) At a point after V1 and before V2 that in the judgment of the person            ..........  ........  .........  .........  ........  ..........
     conducting the check is appropriate to the airplane type under the prevailing
     conditions;......................................................................
    (2) At a point as close as possible after V1 when V1 and V2 or V1 and Vr are        ..........  ........  .........  .........  ........  ..........
     identical; or....................................................................
    (3) At the appropriate speed for non-transport category airplanes.................  ..........  ........  .........  .........  ........  ..........
In an airplane group with aft fuselage-mounted engines this maneuver may be performed   ..........  ........  .........  .........  ........  ..........

 takeoff run after reaching a reasonable speed determined by giving due consideration
 to aircraft characteristics, runway length, surface conditions, wind direction and
 velocity, brake heat energy, and any other pertinent factors that may adversely
 affect safety or the airplane........................................................
III. Instrument procedures:
  (a) Area departure and area arrival. During each of these maneuvers the applicant             B   ........  .........        B    ........         B*
   must--.............................................................................
    (1) Adhere to actual or simulated ATC clearances (including assigned radials); and  ..........  ........  .........  .........  ........  ..........
    (2) Properly use available navigation facilities..................................  ..........  ........  .........  .........  ........  ..........
Either area arrival or area departure, but not both, may be waived under Sec.
 121.441(d)
  (b) Holding. This maneuver includes entering, maintaining, and leaving holding                B   ........  .........        B    ........          B
   patterns. It may be performed in connection with either area departure or area

  (c) ILS and other instrument approaches. There must be the following:
    (1) At least one normal ILS approach..............................................          B   ........        B    .........  ........  ..........
    (2) At least one manually controlled ILS approach with a simulated failure of one           B   ........  .........  .........  ........  ..........
     powerplant. The simulated failure should occur before initiating the final
     approach course and must continue to touchdown or through the missed approach
     procedure........................................................................
    (3) At least one nonprecision approach procedure that is representative of the              B   ........        B    .........  ........  ..........
     nonprecision approach procedures that the certificate holder is likely to use....

[[Page 607]]

 
    (4) Demonstration of at least one nonprecision approach procedure on a letdown aid          B   ........  .........  .........        B   ..........
     other than the approach procedure performed under subparagraph (3) of this
     paragraph that the certificate holder is approved to use. If performed in a
     training device, the procedures must be observed by a check pilot or an approved
     instructor.......................................................................
Each instrument approach must be performed according to any procedures and limitations
 approved for the approach facility used. The instrument approach begins when the
 airplane is over the initial approach fix for the approach procedure being used (or
 turned over to the final approach controller in the case of GCA approach) and ends
 when the airplane touches down on the runway or when transition to a missed approach
 configuration is completed. Instrument conditions need not be simulated below
 100[foot] above touchdown zone elevation
  (d) Circling approaches. If the certificate holder is approved for circling minimums  ..........  ........       B*    .........  ........         B*
   below 1000-3, at least one circling approach must be made under the following
   conditions--.......................................................................
    (1) The portion of the approach to the authorized minimum circling approach                 B   ........  .........  .........  ........  ..........
     altitude must be made under simulated instrument conditions......................
    (2) The approach must be made to the authorized minimum circling approach altitude  ..........  ........  .........  .........  ........  ..........
     followed by a change in heading and the necessary maneuvering (by visual
     reference) to maintain a flight path that permits a normal landing on a runway at
     least 90[deg] from the final approach course of the simulated instrument portion
     of the approach..................................................................
    (3) The circling approach must be performed without excessive maneuvering, and      ..........  ........  .........  .........  ........  ..........
     without exceeding the normal operating limits of the airplane. The angle of bank
     should not exceed 30[deg]........................................................
If local conditions beyond the control of the pilot prohibit the maneuver or prevent
 it from being performed as required, it may be waived as provided in Sec.
 121.441(d): Provided, however, That the maneuver may not be waived under this
 provision for two successive proficiency checks. The circling approach maneuver is
 not required for a second-in-command if the certificate holder's manual prohibits a
 second-in-command from performing a circling approach in operations under this part
  (e) Missed approach.................................................................  ..........  ........  .........  .........  ........  ..........
    (1) Each pilot must perform at least one missed approach from an ILS approach.....  ..........  ........       B*    .........  ........  ..........
    (2) Each pilot in command must perform at least one additional missed approach....  ..........  ........       P*    .........  ........  ..........
A complete approved missed approach procedure must be accomplished at least once. At
 the discretion of the person conducting the check a simulated powerplant failure may
 be required during any of the missed approaches. These maneuvers may be performed
 either independently or in conjunction with maneuvers required under Sections III or
 V of this appendix. At least one missed approach must be performed in flight
IV. Inflight Maneuvers:
  (a) Steep turns. At least one steep turn in each direction must be performed. Each            P   ........  .........        P    ........          P
   steep turn must involve a bank angle of 45[deg] with a heading change of at least
   180[deg] but not more than 360[deg]................................................
  (b) Approaches to stalls. For the purpose of this maneuver the required approach to           B   ........  .........        B    ........         B*
   a stall is reached when there is a perceptible buffet or other response to the
   initial stall entry. Except as provided below there must be at least three
   approaches to stalls as follows:...................................................

[[Page 608]]

 
    (1) One must be in the takeoff configuration (except where the airplane uses only   ..........  ........  .........  .........  ........  ..........
     a zero-flap takeoff configuration)...............................................
    (2) One in a clean configuration..................................................  ..........  ........  .........  .........  ........  ..........
    (3) One in a landing configuration................................................  ..........  ........  .........  .........  ........  ..........
At the discretion of the person conducting the check, one approach to a stall must be
 performed in one of the above configurations while in a turn with the bank angle
 between 15[deg] and 30[deg]. Two out of the three approaches required by this
 paragraph may be waived
If the certificate holder is authorized to dispatch or flight release the airplane
 with a stall warning device inoperative the device may not be used during this
 maneuver
  (c) Specific flight characteristics. Recovery from specific flight characteristics    ..........  ........  .........        B    ........          B
   that are peculiar to the airplane type.............................................
  (d) Powerplant failures. In addition to specific requirements for maneuvers with      ..........  ........  .........        B    ........  ..........
   simulated powerplant failures, the person conducting the check may require a
   simulated powerplant failure at any time during the check..........................
V. Landings and Approaches to Landings:
Notwithstanding the authorizations for combining and waiving maneuvers and for the use
 of a simulator, at least two actual landings (one to a full stop) must be made for
 all pilot-in-command and initial second-in-command proficiency checks. Landings, and
 approaches to landings must include the following, but more than one type may be
 combined where appropriate:
Landings and approaches to landings must include the types listed below, but more than
 one type may be combined where appropriate:
  (a) Normal landing..................................................................  ..........        B   .........  .........  ........  ..........
  (b) Landing in sequence from an ILS instrument approach except that if circumstances  ..........       B*   .........  .........  ........  ..........
   beyond the control of the pilot prevent an actual landing, the person conducting
   the check may accept an approach to a point where in his judgment a landing to a
   full stop could have been made.....................................................
  (c) Crosswind landing, if practical under existing meteorological, airport, and       ..........       B*   .........  .........  ........  ..........
   traffic conditions.................................................................
  (d) Maneuvering to a landing with simulated powerplant failure as follows:
    (1) In the case of 3-engine airplanes, maneuvering to a landing with an approved    ..........  ........       B*    .........  ........  ..........
     procedure that approximates the loss of two powerplants (center and one outboard
     engine); or......................................................................
    (2) In the case of other multiengine airplanes, maneuvering to a landing with a     ..........  ........       B*    .........  ........  ..........
     simulated failure of 50 percent of available powerplants, with the simulated loss
     of power on one side of the airplane.............................................

[[Page 609]]

 
Notwithstanding the requirements of subparagraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this paragraph,
 in a proficiency check for other than a pilot-in-command, the simulated loss of power
 may be only the most critical powerplant. However, if a pilot satisfies the
 requirements of subparagraphs (d) (1) or (2) of this paragraph in a visual simulator,
 he also must maneuver in flight to a landing with a simulated failure of the most
 critical powerplant. In addition, a pilot-in-command may omit the maneuver required
 by subparagraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this paragraph during a required proficiency
 check or simulator course of training if he satisfactorily performed that maneuver
 during the preceding proficiency check, or during the preceding approved simulator
 course of training under the observation of a check airman, whichever was completed
 later
  (e) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, if the certificate holder    ..........  ........       B*    .........  ........  ..........
   is approved for circling minimums below 1000-3, a landing under simulated circling
   approach conditions. However, when performed in an airplane, if circumstances
   beyond the control of the pilot prevent a landing, the person conducting the check
   may accept an approach to a point where, in his judgment, a landing to a full stop
   could have been made...............................................................
  <greek-i>(f) A rejected landing, including a normal missed approach procedure, that   ..........  ........        B    .........  ........  ..........
   is rejected approximately 50[foot] over the runway and approximately over the
   runway threshold. This maneuver may be combined with instrument, circling, or
   missed approach procedures, but instrument conditions need not be simulated below
   100 feet above the runway..........................................................
VI. Normal and Abnormal Procedures:
Each applicant must demonstrate the proper use of as many of the systems and devices
 listed below as the person conducting the check finds are necessary to determine that
 the person being checked has a practical knowledge of the use of the systems and
 devices appropriate to the airplane type:
  (a) Anti-icing and de-icing systems.................................................  ..........  ........  .........        B    ........  ..........
  (b) Auto-pilot systems..............................................................  ..........  ........  .........        B    ........  ..........
  (c) Automatic or other approach aid systems.........................................  ..........  ........  .........        B    ........  ..........
  (d) Stall warning devices, stall avoidance devices, and stability augmentation        ..........  ........  .........        B    ........  ..........
   devices............................................................................
  (e) Airborne radar devices..........................................................  ..........  ........  .........        B    ........  ..........
  (f) Any other systems, devices, or aids available...................................  ..........  ........  .........        B    ........  ..........
  (g) Hydraulic and electrical system failures and malfunctions.......................  ..........  ........  .........  .........        B   ..........
  (h) Landing gear and flap systems failure or malfunction............................  ..........  ........  .........  .........        B   ..........
  (i) Failure of navigation or communications equipment...............................  ..........  ........  .........        B    ........  ..........
VII. Emergency Procedures:
Each applicant must demonstrate the proper emergency procedures for as many of the
 emergency situations listed below as the person conducting the check finds are
 necessary to determine that the person being checked has an adequate knowledge of,
 and ability to perform, such procedure:
  (a) Fire in flight..................................................................  ..........  ........  .........        B    ........  ..........
  (b) Smoke control...................................................................  ..........  ........  .........        B    ........  ..........
  (c) Rapid decompression.............................................................  ..........  ........  .........        B    ........  ..........
  (d) Emergency descent...............................................................  ..........  ........  .........        B    ........  ..........
  (e) Any other emergency procedures outlined in the appropriate approved Airplane      ..........  ........  .........        B    ........  ..........

54 FR 39293, Sept. 25, 1989]

               Appendix H to Part 121--Advanced Simulation

    This appendix provides guidelines and a means for achieving 
flightcrew training in advanced airplane simulators. This appendix 
describes the simulator and visual system requirements which must be 
achieved to obtain approval of certain types of training in the 
simulator. The requirements in this appendix are in addition to the 
simulator approval requirements in Sec. 121.407. Each simulator which 
is used under this appendix must be approved as a Level B, C, or D 
simulator, as appropriate.
    To obtain FAA approval of the simulator for a specific level, the 
following must be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator:
    1. Documented proof of compliance with the appropriate simulator, 
visual system, and additional training requirements of this appendix for 
the level for which approval is requested.

[[Page 612]]

    2. An evaluation of the simulator to ensure that its ground, flight, 
and landing performance matches the type of airplane simulated.
    3. An evaluation of the appropriate simulator and visual system 
requirements of the level for which approval is requested.

                     Changes to Simulator Programing

    While a need exists for some flexibility in making changes in the 
software program, strict scrutiny of these changes is essential to 
ensure that the simulator retains its ability to duplicate the 
airplane's flight and ground characteristics. Therefore, the following 
procedure must be followed to allow these changes without affecting the 
approval of an appendix H simulator:
    1. Twenty-one calendar days before making changes to the software 
program which might impact flight or ground dynamics of an appendix H 
simulator, a complete list of these planned changes, including dynamics 
related to the motion and visual systems, must be provided in writing to 
the FAA office responsible for conducting the recurrent evaluation of 
that simulator.
    2. If the FAA does not object to the planned change within 21 
calendar days, the operator may make the change.
    3. Changes which might affect the approved simulator Level B test 
guide must be tested by the operator in the simulator to determine the 
impact of the change before submission to the FAA.
    4. Software changes actually installed must be summarized and 
provided to the FAA. When the operator's test shows a difference in 
simulator performance due to a change, an amended copy of the test guide 
page which includes the new simulator test results will also be provided 
to update the FAA's copy of the test guide.
    5. The FAA may examine supporting data or flight check the 
simulator, or both, to ensure that the aerodynamic quality of the 
simulator has not been degraded by any change in software programing.
    6. All requests for changes are evaluated on the basis of the same 
criteria used in the initial approval of the simulator for Level B, C, 
or D.

                 Simulator Minimum Equipment List (MEL)

    Because of the strict tolerances and other approval requirements of 
appendix H simulators, the simulator can provide realistic training with 
certain nonessential items inoperative. Therefore, an operator may 
operate its simulator under an MEL which has been approved by the 
Administrator for that simulator. The MEL includes simulator components 
and indicates the type of training or checking that is authorized if the 
component becomes inoperative. To accomplish this, the component is 
placed in one of the following categories along with any remarks 
applicable to the component's use in the training program:
    1. No training or checking.
    2. Training in specific maneuvers.
    3. Certification and checking.
    4. Line Oriented Flight Training (LOFT).

                  Advanced Simulation Training Program

    For an operator to conduct Level C or D training under this appendix 
all required simulator instruction and checks must be conducted under an 
advanced simulation training program which is approved by the 
Administrator for the operator. This program must also ensure that all 
instructors and check airmen used in appendix H training and checking 
are highly qualified to provide the training required in the training 
program. The advanced simulation training program shall include the 
following:
    1. The operator's initial, transition, upgrade, and recurrent 
simulator training programs and its procedures for re-establishing 
recency of experience in the simulator.
    2. How the training program will integrate Level B, C, and D 
simulators with other simulators and training devices to maximize the 
total training, checking, and certification functions.
    3. Documentation that each instructor and check airman has served 
for at least 1 year in that capacity in a certificate holder's approved 
program or has served for at least 1 year as a pilot in command or 
second in command in an airplane of the group in which that pilot is 
instructing or checking.
    4. A procedure to ensure that each instructor and check airman 
actively participates in either an approved regularly scheduled line 
flying program as a flight crewmember or an approved line observation 
program in the same airplane type for which that person is instructing 
or checking.
    5. A procedure to ensure that each instructor and check airman is 
given a minimum of 4 hours of training each year to become familiar with 
the operator's advanced simulation training program, or changes to it, 
and to emphasize their respective roles in the program. Training for 
simulator instructors and check airmen shall include training policies 
and procedures, instruction methods and techniques, operation of 
simulator controls (including environmental and trouble panels), 
limitations of the simulator, and minimum equipment required for each 
course of training.
    6. A special Line Oriented Flight Training (LOFT) program to 
facilitate the transition from the simulator to line flying. This LOFT 
program consists of at least a 4-hour course of training for each 
flightcrew. It also contains at least two representative flight segments 
of the operator's route. One of the flight segments contains strictly 
normal operating procedures from push back at one airport to arrival at 
another. Another flight

[[Page 613]]

segment contains training in appropriate abnormal and emergency flight 
operations.

airplane (for example, high-speed buffet, extended landing gear, flaps, 
nose-wheel scuffing, stall) which can be sensed at the flight deck. The 
simulator must be programed and instrumented in such a manner that the 
characteristic buffet modes can be measured and compared to airplane 
data. Airplane data are also required to define flight deck motions when 
the airplane is subjected to atmospheric disturbances such as rough air 
and cobblestone turbulence. General purpose disturbance models that 
approximate demonstrable flight test data are acceptable.
    2. Aerodynamic modeling for aircraft for which an original type 
certificate is issued after June 1, 1980, including low-altitude, level-

    1. Daylight, dusk, and night visual scenes with sufficient scene 
content to recognize a specific airport, the terrain, and major 
landmarks around that airport and to successfully accomplish a visual 
landing. The daylight visual scene must be part of a total daylight 
cockpit environment which at least represents the amount of light in the 
cockpit

[[Page 615]]

is defined as a visual system capable of producing, as a minimum, full 
color presentations, scene content comparable in detail to that produced 
by 4,000 edges or 1,000 surfaces for daylight and 4,000 light points for 
night and dusk scenes, 6-foot lamberts of light at the pilot's eye 
(highlight brightness), 3-arc minutes resolution for the field of view 
at the pilot's eye, and a display which is free of apparent quantization 
and other distracting visual effects while the simulator is in motion. 
The simulation of cockpit ambient lighting shall be dynamically 
consistent with the visual scene displayed. For daylight scenes, such 
ambient lighting shall neither ``washout'' the displayed visual scene 
nor fall below 5-foot lamberts of light as reflected from an approach 
plate at knee height at the pilot's station and/or 2-foot lamberts of 
light as reflected from the pilot's face.

which are known to cause landing illusions in some pilots, including 
short runway, landing over water, runway gradient, visual topographic 
features, and rising terrain.

and motion effects of entering light, medium, and heavy precipitation 
near a thunderstorm on takeoff, approach, and landings at and below an 
altitude of 2,000 feet HAA and within a radius of 10 miles from the 
airport.
    4. Level C visual requirements in daylight as well as dusk and night 
representations.
    5. Wet and, if appropriate for the operator, snow-covered runway 
representations, including runway lighting effects.
    6. Realistic color and directionality of airport lighting.
    7. Weather radar presentations in aircraft where radar information 
is presented on the pilot's navigation instruments.

the aircraft with the intention of flight and all such persons have 
disembarked, and in which any person suffers death or serious injury, or 
in which the aircraft receives substantial damage.
    Contractor is an individual or company that performs a safety-
sensitive function by contract for an employer or another contractor.
    DOT agency means an agency (or ``operating administration'') of the 
United States Department of Transportation administering regulations 
requiring drug testing (14 CFR part 61 et al.; 46 CFR part 16; 49 CFR 
parts 199, 219, and 382) in accordance with 49 CFR part 40.
    Employee is a person who is hired, either directly or by contract, 
to perform a safety-sensitive function for an employer, as defined 
below. An employee is also a person who transfers into a position to 
perform a safety-sensitive function for an employer.
    Employer is a part 121 certificate holder, a part 135 certificate 
holder, an operator as defined in Sec. 135.1(c) of this chapter, or an 
air traffic control facility not operated by the FAA or by or under 
contract to the U.S. military. An employer may use a contract employee 
who is not included under that employer's FAA-mandated antidrug program 
to perform a safety-sensitive function only if that contract employee is 
included under the contractor's FAA-mandated antidrug program and is 
performing a safety-sensitive function on behalf of that contractor 
(i.e., within the scope of employment with the contractor.)
    Hire means retaining an individual for a safety-sensitive function 
as a paid employee, as a volunteer, or through barter or other form of 
compensation.
    Performing (a safety-sensitive function): an employee is considered 
to be performing a safety-sensitive function during any period in which 
he or she is actually performing, ready to perform, or immediately 
available to perform such function.
    Positive rate for random drug testing means the number of verified 
positive results for random drug tests conducted under this appendix 
plus the number of refusals of random drug tests required by this 
appendix, divided by the total number of random drug test results (i.e., 
positives, negatives, and refusals) under this appendix.
    Prohibited drug means marijuana, cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine 
(PCP), and amphetamines, as specified in 49 CFR 40.85.
    Refusal to submit means that a covered employee engages in conduct 
specified in 49 CFR 40.191.
    Safety-sensitive function means a function listed in section III of 
this appendix.
    Verified negative drug test result means a drug test result from an 
HHS-certified laboratory that has undergone review by an MRO and has 
been determined by the MRO to be a negative result.
    Verified positive drug test result means a drug test result from an 
HHS-certified laboratory that has undergone review by an MRO and has 
been determined by the MRO to be a positive result.
    III. Employees Who Must be Tested. Each employee, including any 
assistant, helper, or individual in a training status, who performs a 
safety-sensitive function listed in this section directly or by contract 
for an employer as defined in this appendix must be subject to drug 
testing under an antidrug program implemented in accordance with this 
appendix. This includes full-time, part-time, temporary, and 
intermittent employees regardless of the degree of supervision. The 
safety-sensitive functions are:
    A. Flight crewmember duties.
    B. Flight attendant duties.
    C. Flight instruction duties.
    D. Aircraft dispatcher duties.
    E. Aircraft maintenance and preventive maintenance duties.
    F. Ground security coordinator duties.
    G. Aviation screening duties.
    H. Air traffic control duties.
    IV. Substances for Which Testing Must Be Conducted. Each employer 
shall test each employee who performs a safety-sensitive function for 
evidence of marijuana, cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), and 
amphetamines during each test required by section V. of this appendix.
    V. Types of Drug Testing Required. Each employer shall conduct the 
following types of testing in accordance with the procedures set forth 
in this appendix and the DOT ``Procedures for Transportation Workplace 
Drug Testing Programs'' (49 CFR part 40):
    A. Pre-Employment Testing.
    1. No employer may hire any individual for a safety-sensitive 
function listed in section III of this appendix unless the employer 
first conducts a pre-employment test and receives a verified negative 
drug test result for that individual.
    2. No employer may allow an individual to transfer from a nonsafety-
sensitive to a safety-sensitive function unless the employer first 
conducts a pre-employment test and receives a verified negative drug 
test result for the individual.
    3. Employers must conduct another pre-employment test and receive a 
verified negative drug test result before hiring or transferring an 
individual into a safety-sensitive function if more than 180 days elapse 
between conducting the pre-employment test required by section V.A.1. or 
V.A.2. of this appendix and hiring or transferring the individual into a 
safety-sensitive function, resulting in that individual being brought 
under an FAA drug-testing program.
    4. If the following criteria are met, an employer is permitted to 
conduct a pre-employment test, and if such a test is conducted, the 
employer must receive a negative test

[[Page 617]]

result before putting the individual into a safety-sensitive function:
    (a) The individual previously performed a safety-sensitive function 
for the employer and the employer is not required to pre-employment test 
the individual under section V.A.1. or V.A.2 of this appendix before 
putting the individual to work in a safety-sensitive function;
    (b) The employer removed the individual from the employer's random 
testing program conducted under this appendix for reasons other than a 
verified positive test result on an FAA-mandated drug test or a refusal 
to submit to such testing; and
    (c) The individual will be returning to the performance of a safety-
sensitive function.
    5. Before hiring or transferring an individual to a safety-sensitive 
function, the employer must advise each individual that the individual 
will be required to undergo pre-employment testing in accordance with 
this appendix, to determine the presence of marijuana, cocaine, opiates, 
phencyclidine (PCP), and amphetamines, or a metabolite of those drugs in 
the individual's system. The employer shall provide this same 
notification to each individual required by the employer to undergo pre-
employment testing under section V.A.4. of this appendix.
    B. Random Testing.
    1. Except as provided in paragraphs 2-4 of this section, the minimum 
annual percentage rate for random drug testing shall be 50 percent of 
covered employees.
    2. The Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum 
annual percentage rate for random drug testing is based on the reported 
positive rate for the entire industry. All information used for this 
determination is drawn from the statistical reports required by section 
X of this appendix. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the 
Administrator considers the quality and completeness of the reported 
data, may obtain additional information or reports from employers, and 
may make appropriate modifications in calculating the industry positive 
rate. Each year, the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register 
the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing of covered 
employees. The new minimum annual percentage rate for random drug 
testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year 
following publication.
    3. When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing 
is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this rate to 25 percent of 
all covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data 
received under the reporting requirements of this appendix for two 
consecutive calendar years indicate that the reported positive rate is 
less than 1.0 percent.
    4. When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing 
is 25 percent, and the data received under the reporting requirements of 
this appendix for any calendar year indicate that the reported positive 
rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the Administrator will 
increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing to 
50 percent of all covered employees.
    5. The selection of employees for random drug testing shall be made 
by a scientifically valid method, such as a random-number table or a 
computer-based random number generator that is matched with employees' 
Social Security numbers, payroll identification numbers, or other 
comparable identifying numbers. Under the selection process used, each 
covered employee shall have an equal chance of being tested each time 
selections are made.
    6. As an employer, you must select and test a percentage of 
employees at least equal to the minimum annual percentage rate each 
year.
    (a) As an employer, to determine whether you have met the minimum 
annual percentage rate, you must divide the number of random testing 
results for safety-sensitive employees by the average number of safety-
sensitive employees eligible for random testing.
    (1) To calculate whether you have met the annual minimum percentage 
rate, count all random positives, random negatives, and random refusals 
as your ``random testing results.''
    (2) To calculate the average number of safety-sensitive employees 
eligible for random testing throughout the year, add the total number of 
safety-sensitive employees eligible for testing during each random 
testing period for the year and divide that total by the number of 
random testing periods. Only safety-sensitive employees are to be in an 
employer's random testing pool, and all safety-sensitive employees must 
be in the random pool. If you are an employer conducting random testing 
more often than once per month (e.g., you select daily, weekly, bi-
weekly) you do not need to compute this total number of safety-sensitive 
employees more than on a once per month basis.
    (b) As an employer, you may use a service agent to perform random 
selections for you, and your safety-sensitive employees may be part of a 
larger random testing pool of safety-sensitive employees. However, you 
must ensure that the service agent you use is testing at the appropriate 
percentage established for your industry and that only safety-sensitive 
employees are in the random testing pool. For example:
    (1) If the service agent has your employees in a random testing pool 
for your company alone, you must ensure that the testing is conducted at 
least at the minimum annual percentage rate under this part.
    (2) If the service agent has your employees in a random testing pool 
combined with other FAA-regulated companies, you must ensure that the 
testing is conducted at least

[[Page 618]]

at the minimum annual percentage rate under this part.
    (3) If the service agent has your employees in a random testing pool 
combined with other DOT-regulated companies, you must ensure that the 
testing is conducted at least at the highest rate required for any DOT-
regulated company in the pool.
    7. Each employer shall ensure that random drug tests conducted under 
this appendix are unannounced and that the dates for administering 
random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year.
    8. Each employer shall require that each safety-sensitive employee 
who is notified of selection for random drug testing proceeds to the 
collection site immediately; provided, however, that if the employee is 
performing a safety-sensitive function at the time of the notification, 
the employer shall instead ensure that the employee ceases to perform 
the safety-sensitive function and proceeds to the collection site as 
soon as possible.
    9. If a given covered employee is subject to random drug testing 
under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the employee 
shall be subject to random drug testing at the percentage rate 
established for the calendar year by the DOT agency regulating more than 
50 percent of the employee's function.
    10. If an employer is required to conduct random drug testing under 
the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the employer may--
    (a) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool 
containing the covered employees who are subject to testing at the same 
required rate; or
    (b) Randomly select covered employees for testing at the highest 
percentage rate established for the calendar year by any DOT agency to 
which the employer is subject.
    11. An employer required to conduct random drug testing under the 
anti drug rules of more than one DOT agency shall provide each such 
agency access to the employer's records of random drug testing, as 
determined to be necessary by the agency to ensure the employer's 
compliance with the rule.
    C. Post-accident Testing. Each employer shall test each employee who 
performs a safety-sensitive function for the presence of marijuana, 
cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), and amphetamines, or a metabolite 
of those drugs in the employee's system if that employee's performance 
either contributed to an accident or can not be completely discounted as 
a contributing factor to the accident. The employee shall be tested as 
soon as possible but not later than 32 hours after the accident. The 
decision not to administer a test under this section must be based on a 
determination, using the best information available at the time of the 
determination, that the employee's performance could not have 
contributed to the accident. The employee shall submit to post-accident 
testing under this section.
    D. Testing Based on Reasonable Cause. Each employer must test each 
employee who performs a safety-sensitive function and who is reasonably 
suspected of having used a prohibited drug. The decision to test must be 
based on a reasonable and articulable belief that the employee is using 
a prohibited drug on the basis of specific contemporaneous physical, 
behavioral, or performance indicators of probable drug use. At least two 
of the employee's supervisors, one of whom is trained in detection of 
the symptoms of possible drug use, must substantiate and concur in the 
decision to test an employee who is reasonably suspected of drug use; 
except that in the case of an employer, other than a part 121 
certificate holder, who employs 50 or fewer employees who perform 
safety-sensitive functions, one supervisor who is trained in detection 
of symptoms of possible drug use must substantiate the decision to test 
an employee who is reasonably suspected of drug use.
    E. Return to Duty Testing. Each employer shall ensure that before an 
individual is returned to duty to perform a safety-sensitive function 
after refusing to submit to a drug test required by this appendix or 
receiving a verified positive drug test result on a test conducted under 
this appendix the individual shall undergo a return to duty drug test. 
No employer shall allow an individual required to undergo return to duty 
testing to perform a safety-sensitive function unless the employer has 
received a verified negative drug test result for the individual. The 
test cannot occur until after the SAP has determined that the employee 
has successfully complied with the prescribed education and/or 
treatment.
    F. Follow-up Testing. 1. Each employer shall implement a reasonable 
program of unannounced testing of each individual who has been hired to 
perform or who has been returned to the performance of a safety-
sensitive function after refusing to submit to a drug test required by 
this appendix or receiving a verified positive drug test result on a 
test conducted under this appendix.
    2. The number and frequency of such testing shall be determined by 
the employer's Substance Abuse Professional conducted in accordance with 
the provisions of 49 CFR part 40, but shall consist of at least six 
tests in the first 12 months following the employee's return to duty.
    3. The employer must direct the employee to undergo testing for 
alcohol in accordance with appendix J of this part, in addition to 
drugs, if the Substance Abuse Professional determines that alcohol 
testing is necessary for the particular employee. Any such alcohol 
testing shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of 49 CFR 
part 40.

[[Page 619]]

    4. Follow-up testing shall not exceed 60 months after the date the 
individual begins to perform or returns to the performance of a safety-
sensitive function. The Substance Abuse Professional may terminate the 
requirement for follow-up testing at any time after the first six tests 
have been conducted, if the Substance Abuse Professional determines that 
such testing is no longer necessary.
    VI. Administrative and Other Matters. A. MRO Record Retention 
Requirements. 1. Records concerning drug tests confirmed positive by the 
laboratory shall be maintained by the MRO for 5 years. Such records 
include the MRO copies of the custody and control form, medical 
interviews, documentation of the basis for verifying as negative test 
results confirmed as positive by the laboratory, any other documentation 
concerning the MRO's verification process.
    2. Should the employer change MROs for any reason, the employer 
shall ensure that the former MRO forwards all records maintained 
pursuant to this rule to the new MRO within ten working days of 
receiving notice from the employer of the new MRO's name and address.
    3. Any employer obtaining MRO services by contract, including a 
contract through a C/TPA, shall ensure that the contract includes a 
recordkeeping provision that is consistent with this paragraph, 
including requirements for transferring records to a new MRO.
    B. Access to Records. The employer and the MRO shall permit the 
Administrator or the Administrator's representative to examine records 
required to be kept under this appendix and 49 CFR part 40. The 
Administrator or the Administrator's representative may require that all 
records maintained by the service agent for the employer must be 
produced at the employer's place of business.
    C. Release of Drug Testing Information. An employer shall release 
information regarding an employee's drug testing results, evaluation, or 
rehabilitation to a third party in accordance with 49 CFR part 40. 
Except as required by law, this appendix, or 49 CFR part 40, no employer 
shall release employee information.
    D. Refusal to Submit to Testing. 1. Each employer must notify the 
FAA within 5 working days of any employee who holds a certificate issued 
under part 61, part 63, or part 65 of this chapter who has refused to 
submit to a drug test required under this appendix. Send these 
notifications to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of Aerospace 
Medicine, Drug Abatement Division (AAM-800), 800 Independence Avenue, 
SW, Washington, DC 20591.
    2. Employers are not required to notify the above office of refusals 
to submit to pre-employment or return to duty testing.
    E. Permanent Disqualification From Service. An employee who has 
verified positive drug test results on two drug tests required by 
appendix I to part 121 of this chapter and conducted after September 19, 
1994 is permanently precluded from performing for an employer the 
safety-sensitive duties the employee performed prior to the second drug 
test.
    2. An employee who has engaged in prohibited drug use during the 
performance of a safety-sensitive function after September 19, 1994 is 
permanently precluded from performing that safety-sensitive function for 
an employer.
    F. DOT Management Information System Annual Reports. Copies of any 
annual reports submitted to the FAA under this appendix must be 
maintained by the employer for a minimum of 5 years.
    VII. Medical Review Officer/Substance Abuse Professional, and 
Employer Responsibilities. The employer shall designate or appoint a 
Medical Review Officer (MRO) who shall be qualified in accordance with 
49 CFR part 40 and shall perform the functions set forth in 49 CFR part 
40 and this appendix. If the employer does not have a qualified 
individual on staff to serve as MRO, the employer may contract for the 
provision of MRO services as part of its drug testing program.
    A. Medical Review Officer (MRO). The MRO must perform the functions 
set forth in 49 CFR part 40, Subpart G, and this appendix. The MRO shall 
not delay verification of the primary test result following a request 
for a split specimen test unless such delay is based on reasons other 
than the fact that the split specimen test result is pending. If the 
primary test result is verified as positive, actions required under this 
rule (e.g., notification to the Federal Air Surgeon, removal from 
safety-sensitive position) are not stayed during the 72-hour request 
period or pending receipt of the split specimen test result.
    B. Substance Abuse Professional (SAP). The SAP must perform the 
functions set forth in 49 CFR part 40, Subpart O.
    C. Additional Medical Review Officer, Substance Abuse Professional, 
and Employer Responsibilities Regarding 14 CFR part 67 Airman Medical 
Certificate Holders. 1. As part of verifying a confirmed positive test 
result, the MRO shall inquire, and the individual shall disclose, 
whether the individual is or would be required to hold a medical 
certificate issued under 14 CFR part 67 to perform a safety-sensitive 
function for the employer. If the individual answers in the negative, 
the MRO shall then inquire, and the individual shall disclose whether 
the individual currently holds a medical certificate issued under 14 CFR 
part 67. If the individual answers in the affirmative to either 
question, in addition to notifying the employer in accordance with 49 
CFR part 40, the MRO must

[[Page 620]]

forward to the Federal Air Surgeon, at the address listed in paragraph 
5, the name of the individual, along with identifying information and 
supporting documentation, within 12 working days after verifying a 
positive drug test result.
    2. The SAP shall inquire, and the individual shall disclose, whether 
the individual is or would be required to hold a medical certificate 
issued under 14 CFR part 67 of this chapter to perform a safety 
sensitive function for the employer. If the individual answers in the 
affirmative, the SAP cannot recommend that the individual be returned to 
a safety-sensitive function that requires the individual to hold a 14 
CFR part 67 medical certificate unless and until such individual has 
received a medical certificate or a special issuance medical certificate 
from the Federal Air Surgeon. The receipt of a medical certificate or a 
special issuance medical certificate does not alter any obligations 
otherwise required by 49 CFR part 40 or this appendix.
    3. The employer must forward to the Federal Air Surgeon a copy of 
any report provided by the SAP, if available, regarding an individual 
for whom the MRO has provided a report to the Federal Air Surgeon under 
section VII.C.1 of this appendix, within 12 working days of the 
employer's receipt of the report.
    4. The employer cannot permit an employee who is required to hold a 
medical certificate under part 67 of this chapter to perform a safety-
sensitive duty to resume that duty until the employee has received a 
medical certificate or a special issuance medical certificate from the 
Federal Air Surgeon unless and until the employer has ensured that the 
employee meets the return-to-duty requirements in accordance with 49 CFR 
part 40.
    5. Reports required under this section shall be forwarded to the 
Federal Air Surgeon, Federal Aviation Administration, Office of 
Aerospace Medicine, Attn: Drug Abatement Division (AAM-800), 800 
Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591.
    VIII. Employee Assistance Program (EAP). The employer shall provide 
an EAP for employees. The employer may establish the EAP as a part of 
its internal personnel services or the employer may contract with an 
entity that will provide EAP services to an employee. Each EAP must 
include education and training on drug use for employees and training 
for supervisors making determinations for testing of employees based on 
reasonable cause.
    A. EAP Education Program. Each EAP education program must include at 
least the following elements: display and distribution of informational 
material; display and distribution of a community service hot-line 
telephone number for employee assistance; and display and distribution 
of the employer's policy regarding drug use in the workplace. The 
employer's policy shall include information regarding the consequences 
under the rule of using drugs while performing safety-sensitive 
functions, receiving a verified positive drug test result, or refusing 
to submit to a drug test required under the rule.
    B. EAP Training Program. Each employer shall implement a reasonable 
program of initial training for employees. The employee training program 
must include at least the following elements: The effects and 
consequences of drug use on personal health, safety, and work 
environment; the manifestations and behavioral cues that may indicate 
drug use and abuse; and documentation of training given to employees and 
employer's supervisory personnel. The employer's supervisory personnel 
who will determine when an employee is subject to testing based on 
reasonable cause shall receive specific training on specific, 
contemporaneous physical, behavioral, and performance indicators of 
probable drug use in addition to the training specified above. The 
employer shall ensure that supervisors who will make reasonable cause 
determinations receive at least 60 minutes of initial training. The 
employer shall implement a reasonable recurrent training program for 
supervisory personnel making reasonable cause determinations during 
subsequent years. The employer shall identify the employee and 
supervisor EAP training in the employer's drug testing plan submitted to 
the FAA for approval.
    IX. Implementing an Antidrug Program.

        Appendix J to Part 121--Alcohol Misuse Prevention Program

    This appendix contains the standards and components that must be 
included in an alcohol misuse prevention program required by this 
chapter.

                               I. General

    A. Purpose. The purpose of this appendix is to establish programs 
designed to help prevent accidents and injuries resulting from the 
misuse of alcohol by employees who perform safety-sensitive functions in 
aviation.
    B. Alcohol testing procedures. Each employer shall ensure that all 
alcohol testing conducted pursuant to this appendix complies with the 
procedures set forth in 49 CFR part 40. The provisions of 49 CFR part 40 
that address alcohol testing are made applicable to employers by this 
appendix.
    C. Employer Responsibility. As an employer, you are responsible for 
all actions of your officials, representatives, and service agents in 
carrying out the requirements of the DOT agency regulations.
    D. Definitions.
    As used in this appendix--
    Accident means an occurrence associated with the operation of an 
aircraft which takes place between the time any person boards the 
aircraft with the intention of flight and the time all such persons have 
disembarked, and in which any person suffers death or serious injury or 
in which the aircraft receives substantial damage.
    Alcohol means the intoxicating agent in beverage alcohol, ethyl 
alcohol, or other low molecular weight alcohols, including methyl or 
isopropyl alcohol.
    Alcohol concentration (or content) means the alcohol in a volume of 
breath expressed in terms of grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath 
as indicated by an evidential breath test under this appendix.
    Alcohol use means the consumption of any beverage, mixture, or 
preparation, including any medication, containing alcohol.
    Contractor means an individual or company that performs a safety-
sensitive function by contract for an employer or another contractor.
    Covered employee means a person who performs, either directly or by 
contract, a safety-sensitive function listed in section II of this 
appendix for an employer (as defined below). For purposes of pre-
employment testing only, the term ``covered employee'' includes a person 
applying to perform a safety-sensitive function.
    DOT agency means an agency (or ``operating administration'') of the 
United States Department of Transportation administering regulations 
requiring alcohol testing (14 CFR parts 65, 121, and 135; 49 CFR parts 
199, 219, and 382) in accordance with 49 CFR part 40.
    Employer means a part 121 certificate holder; a part 135 certificate 
holder; an air traffic control facility not operated by the FAA or by or 
under contract to the U.S. military; and an operator as defined in 14 
CFR 135.1(c).
    Performing (a safety-sensitive function): an employee is considered 
to be performing a safety-sensitive function during any period in which 
he or she is actually performing, ready to perform, or immediately 
available to perform such functions.
    Refusal to submit means that a covered employee engages in conduct 
specified in 49 CFR 40.261.
    Safety-sensitive function means a function listed in section II of 
this appendix.
    Violation rate for random alcohol testing means the number of 0.04 
and above random alcohol confirmation test results conducted under this 
appendix plus the number of refusals of random alcohol tests required by 
this appendix, divided by the total number of random alcohol screening 
tests (including refusals) conducted under this appendix.
    E. Preemption of State and local laws.
    1. Except as provided in subparagraph 2 of this paragraph, these 
regulations preempt any State or local law, rule, regulation, or order 
to the extent that:

[[Page 624]]

    (a) Compliance with both the State or local requirement and this 
appendix is not possible; or
    (b) Compliance with the State or local requirement is an obstacle to 
the accomplishment and execution of any requirement in this appendix.
    2. The alcohol misuse requirements of this title shall not be 
construed to preempt provisions of State criminal law that impose 
sanctions for reckless conduct leading to actual loss of life, injury, 
or damage to property, whether the provisions apply specifically to 
transportation employees or employers or to the general public.
    F. Other requirements imposed by employers.
    Except as expressly provided in these alcohol misuse requirements, 
nothing in these requirements shall be construed to affect the authority 
of employers, or the rights of employees, with respect to the use or 
possession of alcohol, including any authority and rights with respect 
to alcohol testing and rehabilitation.
    G. Requirement for notice.
    Before performing an alcohol test under this appendix, each employer 
shall notify a covered employee that the alcohol test is required by 
this appendix. No employer shall falsely represent that a test is 
administered under this appendix.

                           III. Tests Required

                        A. Pre-employment testing

    As an employer, you may, but are not required to, conduct pre-
employment alcohol testing under this part. If you choose to conduct 
pre-employment alcohol testing, you must comply with the following 
requirements:
    1. You must conduct a pre-employment alcohol test before the first 
performance of safety-sensitive functions by every covered employee 
(whether a new employee or someone who has transferred to a position 
involving the performance of safety-sensitive functions).
    2. You must treat all safety-sensitive employees performing safety-
sensitive functions the same for the purpose of pre-employment alcohol 
testing (i.e., you must not test some covered employees and not others).
    3. You must conduct the pre-employment tests after making a 
contingent offer of employment or transfer, subject to the employee 
passing the pre-employment alcohol test.
    4. You must conduct all pre-employment alcohol tests using the 
alcohol testing procedures of 49 CFR Part 40.

[[Page 625]]

    5. You must not allow a covered employee to begin performing safety-
sensitive functions unless the result of the employee's test indicates 
an alcohol concentration of less than 0.04. If a pre-employment test 
result under this paragraph indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.02 
or greater but less than 0.04, the provisions of paragraph F. of section 
V. of this appendix apply.

                        B. Post-accident testing

    1. As soon as practicable following an accident, each employer shall 
test each surviving covered employee for alcohol if that employee's 
performance of a safety-sensitive function either contributed to the 
accident or cannot be completely discounted as a contributing factor to 
the accident. The decision not to administer a test under this section 
shall be based on the employer's determination, using the best available 
information at the time of the determination, that the covered 
employee's performance could not have contributed to the accident.
    2. If a test required by this section is not administered within 2 
hours following the accident, the employer shall prepare and maintain on 
file a record stating the reasons the test was not promptly 
administered. If a test required by this section is not administered 
within 8 hours following the accident, the employer shall cease attempts 
to administer an alcohol test and shall prepare and maintain the same 
record. Records shall be submitted to the FAA upon request of the 
Administrator or his or her designee.
    3. A covered employee who is subject to post-accident testing shall 
remain readily available for such testing or may be deemed by the 
employer to have refused to submit to testing. Nothing in this section 
shall be construed to require the delay of necessary medical attention 
for injured people following an accident or to prohibit a covered 
employee from leaving the scene of an accident for the period necessary 
to obtain assistance in responding to the accident or to obtain 
necessary emergency medical care.

                            C. Random testing

    1. Except as provided in paragraphs 2-4 of this section, the minimum 
annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing will be 25 percent of 
the covered employees.
    2. The Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum 
annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is based on the 
violation rate for the entire industry. All information used for this 
determination is drawn from MIS reports required by this appendix. In 
order to ensure reliability of the data, the Administrator considers the 
quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain additional 
information or reports from employers, and may make appropriate 
modifications in calculating the industry violation rate. Each year, the 
Administrator will publish in the Federal Register the minimum annual 
percentage rate for random alcohol testing of covered employees. The new 
minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing will be 
applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year following 
publication.
    3. (a) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol 
testing is 25 percent or more, the Administrator may lower this rate to 
10 percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that 
the data received under the reporting requirements of this appendix for 
two consecutive calendar years indicate that the violation rate is less 
than 0.5 percent.
    (b) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol 
testing is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this rate to 25 
percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that 
the data received under the reporting requirements of this appendix for 
two consecutive calendar years indicate that the violation rate is less 
than 1.0 percent but equal to or greater than 0.5 percent.
    4. (a) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol 
testing is 10 percent, and the data received under the reporting 
requirements of this appendix for that calendar year indicate that the 
violation rate is equal to or greater than 0.5 percent but less than 1.0 
percent, the Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage 
rate for random alcohol testing to 25 percent of all covered employees.
    (b) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol 
testing is 25 percent or less, and the data received under the reporting 
requirements of this appendix for that calendar year indicate that the 
violation rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the 
Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for 
random alcohol testing to 50 percent of all covered employees.
    5. The selection of employees for random alcohol testing shall be 
made by a scientifically valid method, such as a random-number table or 
a computer-based random number generator that is matched with employees' 
Social Security numbers, payroll identification numbers, or other 
comparable identifying numbers. Under the selection process used, each 
covered employee shall have an equal chance of being tested each time 
selections are made.
    6. As an employer, you must select and test a percentage of 
employees at least equal to the minimum annual percentage rate each 
year.
    (a) As an employer, to determine whether you have met the minimum 
annual percentage rate, you must divide the number of random alcohol 
screening test results for safety-sensitive employees by the average 
number

[[Page 626]]

of safety-sensitive employees eligible for random testing.
    (1) To calculate whether you have met the annual minimum percentage 
rate, count all random screening test results below 0.02 breath alcohol 
concentration, random screening test results of 0.02 or greater breath 
alcohol concentration, and random refusals as your ``random alcohol 
screening test results.''
    (2) To calculate the average number of safety-sensitive employees 
eligible for random testing throughout the year, add the total number of 
safety-sensitive employees eligible for testing during each random 
testing period for the year and divide that total by the number of 
random testing periods. Only safety-sensitive employees are to be in an 
employer's random testing pool, and all safety-sensitive employees must 
be in the random pool. If you are an employer conducting random testing 
more often than once per month (e.g., you select daily, weekly, bi-
weekly) you do not need to compute this total number of safety-sensitive 
employees more than on a once per month basis.
    (b) As an employer, you may use a service agent to perform random 
selections for you, and your safety-sensitive employees may be part of a 
larger random testing pool of safety-sensitive employees. However, you 
must ensure that the service agent you use is testing at the appropriate 
percentage established for your industry and that only safety-sensitive 
employees are in the random testing pool. For example:
    (1) If the service agent has your employees in a random testing pool 
for your company alone, you must ensure that the testing is conducted at 
least at the minimum annual percentage rate under this part.
    (2) If the service agent has your employees in a random testing pool 
combined with other FAA-regulated companies, you must ensure that the 
testing is conducted at least at the minimum annual percentage rate 
under this part.
    (3) If the service agent has your employees in a random testing pool 
combined with other DOT-regulated companies, you must ensure that the 
testing is conducted at least at the highest rate required for any DOT-
regulated company in the pool.
    7. Each employer shall ensure that random alcohol tests conducted 
under this appendix are unannounced and that the dates for administering 
random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year.
    8. Each employer shall require that each covered employee who is 
notified of selection for random testing proceeds to the testing site 
immediately; provided, however, that if the employee is performing a 
safety-sensitive function at the time of the notification, the employer 
shall instead ensure that the employee ceases to perform the safety-
sensitive function and proceeds to the testing site as soon as possible.
    9. A covered employee shall only be randomly tested while the 
employee is performing safety-sensitive functions; just before the 
employee is to perform safety-sensitive functions; or just after the 
employee has ceased performing such functions.
    10. If a given covered employee is subject to random alcohol testing 
under the alcohol testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the 
employee shall be subject to random alcohol testing at the percentage 
rate established for the calendar year by the DOT agency regulating more 
than 50 percent of the employee's functions.
    11. If an employer is required to conduct random alcohol testing 
under the alcohol testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the 
employer may--
    (a) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool 
containing the covered employees who are subject to testing at the same 
required rate; or
    (b) Randomly select such employees for testing at the highest 
percentage rate established for the calendar year by any DOT agency to 
which the employer is subject.

                     D. Reasonable Suspicion Testing

    1. An employer shall require a covered employee to submit to an 
alcohol test when the employer has reasonable suspicion to believe that 
the employee has violated the alcohol misuse prohibitions in Sec. 
65.46a, 121.458, or 135.253 of this chapter.
    2. The employer's determination that reasonable suspicion exists to 
require the covered employee to undergo an alcohol test shall be based 
on specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the 
appearance, behavior, speech or body odors of the employee. The required 
observations shall be made by a supervisor who is trained in detecting 
the symptoms of alcohol misuse. The supervisor who makes the 
determination that reasonable suspicion exists shall not conduct the 
breath alcohol test on that employee.
    3. Alcohol testing is authorized by this section only if the 
observations required by paragraph 2 are made during, just preceding, or 
just after the period of the work day that the covered employee is 
required to be in compliance with this rule. An employee may be directed 
by the employer to undergo reasonable suspicion testing for alcohol only 
while the employee is performing safety-sensitive functions; just before 
the employee is to perform safety-sensitive functions; or just after the 
employee has ceased performing such functions.
    4. (a) If a test required by this section is not administered within 
2 hours following the determination made under paragraph 2 of this 
section, the employer shall prepare and maintain on file a record 
stating the reasons

[[Page 627]]

the test was not promptly administered. If a test required by this 
section is not administered within 8 hours following the determination 
made under paragraph 2 of this section, the employer shall cease 
attempts to administer an alcohol test and shall state in the record the 
reasons for not administering the test.
    (b) Notwithstanding the absence of a reasonable suspicion alcohol 
test under this section, no covered employee shall report for duty or 
remain on duty requiring the performance of safety-sensitive functions 
while the employee is under the influence of or impaired by alcohol, as 
shown by the behavioral, speech, or performance indicators of alcohol 
misuse, nor shall an employer permit the covered employee to perform or 
continue to perform safety-sensitive functions until:
    (1) An alcohol test is administered and the employee's alcohol 
concentration measures less than 0.02; or
    (2) The start of the employee's next regularly scheduled duty 
period, but not less than 8 hours following the determination made under 
paragraph 2 of this section that there is reasonable suspicion that the 
employee has violated the alcohol misuse provisions in Sec. 65.46a, 
121.458, or 135.253 of this chapter.
    (c) No employer shall take any action under this appendix against a 
covered employee based solely on the employee's behavior and appearance 
in the absence of an alcohol test. This does not prohibit an employer 
with authority independent of this appendix from taking any action 
otherwise consistent with law.

                        E. Return to Duty Testing

    Each employer shall ensure that before a covered employee returns to 
duty requiring the performance of a safety-sensitive function after 
engaging in conduct prohibited in Sec. 65.46a, Sec. 121.458, or Sec. 
135.253 of this chapter, the employee shall undergo a return to duty 
alcohol test with a result indicating an alcohol concentration of less 
than 0.02. The test cannot occur until after the SAP has determined that 
the employee has successfully complied with the prescribed education 
and/or treatment.

                          F. Follow-up Testing

    1. Each employer shall ensure that the employee who engages in 
conduct prohibited by Sec. 65.46a, Sec. 121.458, or Sec. 135.253 of 
this chapter is subject to unannounced follow-up alcohol testing as 
directed by a SAP.
    2. The number and frequency of such testing shall be determined by 
the employer's SAP, but must consist of at least six tests in the first 
12 months following the employee's return to duty.
    3. The employer must direct the employee to undergo testing for 
drugs in accordance with appendix I of this part, in addition to 
alcohol, if the SAP determines that drug testing is necessary for the 
particular employee. Any such drug testing shall be conducted in 
accordance with the provisions of 49 CFR part 40.
    4. Follow-up testing shall not exceed 60 months after the date the 
individual begins to perform or returns to the performance of a safety-
sensitive function. The SAP may terminate the requirement for follow-up 
testing at any time after the first six tests have been conducted, if 
the SAP determines that such testing is no longer necessary.
    5. A covered employee shall be tested for alcohol under this 
paragraph only while the employee is performing safety-sensitive 
functions, just before the employee is to perform safety-sensitive 
functions, or just after the employee has ceased performing such 
functions.

G. Retesting of Covered Employees With an Alcohol Concentration of 0.02 
                      or Greater but Less Than 0.04

    Each employer shall retest a covered employee to ensure compliance 
with the provisions of section V, paragraph F of this appendix, if the 
employer chooses to permit the employee to perform a safety-sensitive 
function within 8 hours following the administration of an alcohol test 
indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 
0.04.

   IV. Handling of Test Results, Record Retention, and Confidentiality

                         A. Retention of Records

    1. General Requirement. In addition to the records required to be 
maintained under 49 CFR part 40, employers must maintain records 
required by this appendix in a secure location with controlled access.

employer's policy on alcohol misuse.
    (6) Documentation of compliance with the requirements of section VI, 
paragraph A of this appendix.
    (7) Documentation of training provided to supervisors for the 
purpose of qualifying the supervisors to make a determination concerning 
the need for alcohol testing based on reasonable suspicion.
    (8) Certification that any training conducted under this appendix 
complies with the requirements for such training.

                            B. Annual Reports

    1. Annual reports of alcohol misuse prevention program results must 
be submitted to the FAA by March 15 of the succeeding calendar year for 
the prior calendar year (January 1 through December 31) in accordance 
with the provisions below.
    (a) Each part 121 certificate holder shall submit an annual report 
each year.
    (b) Each entity conducting an alcohol misuse prevention program 
under this part, other than a part 121 certificate holder, that has 50 
or more employees performing a safety-sensitive function on January 1 of 
any calendar year shall submit an annual report to the FAA for that 
calendar year.
    (c) The Administrator reserves the right to require that aviation 
employers not otherwise required to submit annual reports prepare and 
submit such reports to the FAA. Employers that will be required to 
submit annual reports under this provision will be notified in writing 
by the FAA.
    2. As an employer, you must use the Management Information System 
(MIS) form and instructions as required by 49 CFR part 40 (at 49 CFR 
40.26 and appendix H to 49 CFR part 40). You may also use the electronic 
version of the MIS form provided by the DOT. The Administrator may 
designate means (e.g., electronic program transmitted via the Internet) 
other than hard-copy, for MIS form submission. For information on where 
to submit MIS forms and for the electronic version of the form, see: 
http://www.faa.gov/avr/aam/adap.
    3. A service agent may prepare the MIS report on behalf of an 
employer. However, a company official (e.g., Designated Employer 
Representative as defined in 49 CFR part 40) must certify the accuracy 
and completeness of the MIS report, no matter who prepares it.

                   C. Access to Records and Facilities

    1. Except as required by law or expressly authorized or required in 
this appendix, no employer shall release covered employee information 
that is contained in records required to be maintained under this 
appendix.
    2. A covered employee is entitled, upon written request, to obtain 
copies of any records pertaining to the employee's use of alcohol, 
including any records pertaining to his or her alcohol tests in 
accordance with 49 CFR part 40. The employer shall promptly provide the 
records requested by the employee. Access to an employee's records shall 
not be contingent upon payment for records other than those specifically 
requested.
    3. Each employer shall permit access to all facilities utilized in 
complying with the requirements of this appendix to the Secretary of 
Transportation or any DOT agency with regulatory authority over the 
employer or any of its covered employees.

    V. Consequences for Employees Engaging in Alcohol-Related Conduct

                A. Removal From Safety-sensitive Function

    1. Except as provided in 49 CFR part 40, no covered employee shall 
perform safety-sensitive functions if the employee has engaged in 
conduct prohibited by Sec. 65.46a, 121.458, or 135.253 of this chapter 
or an alcohol misuse rule of another DOT agency.
    2. No employer shall permit any covered employee to perform safety-
sensitive functions if the employer has determined that the employee has 
violated this paragraph.

               B. Permanent Disqualification From Service

    An employee who violates Sec. 65.46a(c), 121.458(c), or 135.253(c) 
of this chapter, or who engages in alcohol use that violates another 
alcohol misuse provision of Sec. 65.46a, 121.458, or 135.253 of this 
chapter and had previously engaged in alcohol use that violated the 
provisions of Sec. 65.46a, 121.458, or 135.253 of this chapter after 
becoming subject to such prohibitions is permanently precluded from 
performing for an employer the safety-sensitive duties the employee 
performed before such violation.

                  C. Notice to the Federal Air Surgeon

    1. An employer who determines that a covered employee who holds an 
airman medical certificate issued under part 67 of this chapter has 
engaged in alcohol use that violated the alcohol misuse provisions of 
Sec. 65.46a, 121.458, or 135.253 of this chapter shall notify the 
Federal Air Surgeon within 2 working days.
    2. Each such employer shall forward to the Federal Air Surgeon a 
copy of the report of any evaluation performed under the provisions of 
section VI.C. of this appendix within

[[Page 629]]

2 working days of the employer's receipt of the report.
    3. All documents must be sent to the Federal Air Surgeon, Federal 
Aviation Administration, Office of Aerospace Medicine, Attn: Drug 
Abatement Division (AAM-800), 800 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, 
DC 20591.
    4. No covered employee who is required to hold a medical certificate 
under part 67 of this chapter to perform a safety-sensitive duty shall 
perform that duty following a violation of this appendix until and 
unless the Federal Air Surgeon has recommended that the employee be 
permitted to perform such duties.
    5. Once the Federal Air Surgeon has recommended under paragraph C.4. 
of this section that the employee be permitted to perform safety-
sensitive duties, the employer cannot permit the employee to perform 
those safety-sensitive duties until the employer has ensured that the 
employee meets the return to duty requirements in accordance with 49 CFR 
part 40.

                          D. Notice of Refusals

    1. Except as provided in subparagraph 2 of this paragraph D, each 
employer shall notify the FAA within 5 working days of any covered 
employee who holds a certificate issued under 14 CFR part 61, part 63, 
or part 65 who has refused to submit to an alcohol test required under 
this appendix. Notifications must be sent to: Federal Aviation 
Administration, Office of Aerospace Medicine, Drug Abatement Division 
(AAM-800), 800 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, DC 20591.
    2. An employer is not required to notify the above office of 
refusals to submit to pre-employment alcohol tests or refusals to submit 
to return to duty tests.

                   E. Required Evaluation and Testing

    No covered employee who has engaged in conduct prohibited by Sec. 
65.46a, 121.458, or 135.253 of this chapter shall perform safety-
sensitive functions unless the employee has met the requirements of 49 
CFR part 40. No employer shall permit a covered employee who has engaged 
in such conduct to perform safety-sensitive functions unless the 
employee has met the requirements of 49 CFR part 40.

                    F. Other Alcohol-Related Conduct

    1. No covered employee tested under the provisions of section III of 
this appendix who is found to have an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or 
greater but less than 0.04 shall perform or continue to perform safety-
sensitive functions for an employer, nor shall an employer permit the 
employee to perform or continue to perform safety-sensitive functions, 
until:
    (a) The employee's alcohol concentration measures less than 0.02; or
    (b) The start of the employee's next regularly scheduled duty 
period, but not less than 8 hours following administration of the test.
    2. Except as provided in subparagraph 1 of this paragraph, no 
employer shall take any action under this rule against an employee based 
solely on test results showing an alcohol concentration less than 0.04. 
This does not prohibit an employer with authority independent of this 
rule from taking any action otherwise consistent with law.

     VI. Alcohol Misuse Information, Training, and Substance Abuse 
                              Professional

 A. Employer Obligation to Promulgate a Policy on the Misuse of Alcohol

    1. General requirements. Each employer shall provide educational 
materials that explain these alcohol misuse requirements and the 
employer's policies and procedures with respect to meeting those 
requirements.
    (a) The employer shall ensure that a copy of these materials is 
distributed to each covered employee prior to the start of alcohol 
testing under the employer's FAA-mandated alcohol misuse prevention 
program and to each person subsequently hired for or transferred to a 
covered position.
    (b) Each employer shall provide written notice to representatives of 
employee organizations of the availability of this information.
    2. Required content. The materials to be made available to employees 
shall include detailed discussion of at least the following:
    (a) The identity of the person designated by the employer to answer 
employee questions about the materials.
    (b) The categories of employees who are subject to the provisions of 
these alcohol misuse requirements.
    (c) Sufficient information about the safety-sensitive functions 
performed by those employees to make clear what period of the work day 
the covered employee is required to be in compliance with these alcohol 
misuse requirements.
    (d) Specific information concerning employee conduct that is 
prohibited by this chapter.
    (e) The circumstances under which a covered employee will be tested 
for alcohol under this appendix.
    (f) The procedures that will be used to test for the presence of 
alcohol, protect the employee and the integrity of the breath testing 
process, safeguard the validity of the test results, and ensure that 
those results are attributed to the correct employee.
    (g) The requirement that a covered employee submit to alcohol tests 
administered in accordance with this appendix.

[[Page 630]]

    (h) An explanation of what constitutes a refusal to submit to an 
alcohol test and the attendant consequences.

available employee assistance program, and/or referral to management.
    (l) Optional provisions. The materials supplied to covered employees 
may also include information on additional employer policies with 
respect to the use or possession of alcohol, including any consequences 
for an employee found to have a specified alcohol level, that are based 
on the employer's authority independent of this appendix. Any such 
additional policies or consequences must be clearly and obviously 
described as being based on independent authority.

                       B. Training for Supervisors

    Each employer shall ensure that persons designated to determine 
whether reasonable suspicion exists to require a covered employee to 
undergo alcohol testing under section II of this appendix receive at 
least 60 minutes of training on the physical, behavioral, speech, and 
performance indicators of probable alcohol misuse.

              C. Substance Abuse Professional (SAP) Duties

    The SAP must perform the functions set forth in 49 CFR part 40, 
Subpart O, and this appendix.

       VII. How To Implement an Alcohol Misuse Prevention Program

         Appendix A to Part 125--Additional Emergency Equipment

    (a) Means for emergency evacuation. Each passenger-carrying 
landplane emergency exit (other than over-the-wing) that is more that 6 
feet from the ground with the airplane on the ground and the landing 
gear extended must have an approved means to assist the occupants in 
descending to the ground. The assisting means for a floor level 
emergency exit must meet the requirements of Sec. 25.809(f)(1) of this 
chapter in effect on April 30, 1972, except that, for any airplane for 
which the application for the type certificate was filed after that 
date, it must meet the requirements under which the airplane was type 
certificated. An assisting means that deploys automatically must be 
armed during taxiing, takeoffs, and landings. However, if the 
Administrator finds that the design of the exit makes compliance 
impractical, the Administrator may grant a deviation from the 
requirement of automatic deployment if the assisting means automatically 
erects upon deployment and, with respect to required emergency exits, if 
an emergency evacuation demonstration is conducted in accordance with 
Sec. 125.189. This paragraph does not apply to the rear window 
emergency exit of DC-3 airplanes operated with less than 36 occupants, 
including crewmembers, and less than five exits authorized for passenger 
use.
    (b) Interior emergency exit marking. The following must be complied 
with for each passenger-carrying airplane:
    (1) Each passenger emergency exit, its means of access, and means of 
opening must be conspicuously marked. The identity and location of each 
passenger emergency exit must be recognizable from a distance equal to 
the width of the cabin. The location of each passenger emergency exit 
must be indicated by a sign visible to occupants approaching along the 
main passenger aisle. There must be a locating sign--
    (i) Above the aisle near each over-the-wing passenger emergency 
exit, or at another ceiling location if it is more practical because of 
low headroom;
    (ii) Next to each floor level passenger emergency exit, except that 
one sign may serve two such exits if they both can be seen readily from 
that sign; and
    (iii) On each bulkhead or divider that prevents fore and aft vision 
along the passenger cabin, to indicate emergency exits beyond and 
obscured by it, except that if this is not possible the sign may be 
placed at another appropriate location.
    (2) Each passenger emergency exit marking and each locating sign 
must meet the following:
    (i) For an airplane for which the application for the type 
certificate was filed prior to May 1, 1972, each passenger emergency 
exit

[[Page 693]]

marking and each locating sign must be manufactured to meet the 
requirements of Sec. 25.812(b) of this chapter in effect on April 30, 
1972. On these airplanes, no sign may continue to be used if its 
luminescence (brightness) decreases to below 100 microlamberts. The 
colors may be reversed if it increases the emergency illumination of the 
passenger compartment. However, the Administrator may authorize 
deviation from the 2-inch background requirements if the Administrator 
finds that special circumstances exist that make compliance impractical 
and that the proposed deviation provides an equivalent level of safety.
    (ii) For an airplane for which the application for the type 
certificate was filed on or after May 1, 1972, each passenger emergency 
exit marking and each locating sign must be manufactured to meet the 
interior emergency exit marking requirements under which the airplane 
was type certificated. On these airplanes, no sign may continue to be 
used if its luminescence (brightness) decreases to below 250 
microlamberts.
    (c) Lighting for interior emergency exit markings. Each passenger-
carrying airplane must have an emergency lighting system, independent of 
the main lighting system. However, sources of general cabin illumination 
may be common to both the emergency and the main lighting systems if the 
power supply to the emergency lighting system is independent of the 
power supply to the main lighting system. The emergency lighting system 
must--
    (1) Illuminate each passenger exit marking and locating sign; and
    (2) Provide enough general lighting in the passenger cabin so that 
the average illumination, when measured at 40-inch intervals at seat 
armrest height, on the centerline of the main passenger aisle, is at 
least 0.05 foot-candles.
    (d) Emergency light operation. Except for lights forming part of 
emergency lighting subsystems provided in compliance with Sec. 
25.812(g) of this chapter (as prescribed in paragraph (h) of this 
section) that serve no more than one assist means, are independent of 
the airplane's main emergency lighting systems, and are automatically 
activated when the assist means is deployed, each light required by 
paragraphs (c) and (h) must comply with the following:
    (1) Each light must be operable manually and must operate 
automatically from the independent lighting system--
    (i) In a crash landing; or
    (ii) Whenever the airplane's normal electric power to the light is 
interrupted.
    (2) Each light must--
    (i) Be operable manually from the flightcrew station and from a 
point in the passenger compartment that is readily accessible to a 
normal flight attendant seat;
    (ii) Have a means to prevent inadvertent operation of the manual 
controls; and
    (iii) When armed or turned on at either station, remain lighted or 
become lighted upon interruption of the airplane's normal electric 
power.
    Each light must be armed or turned on during taxiing, takeoff, and 
landing. In showing compliance with this paragraph, a transverse 
vertical separation of the fuselage need not be considered.
    (3) Each light must provide the required level of illumination for 
at least 10 minutes at the critical ambient conditions after emergency 
landing.
    (e) Emergency exit operating handles.
    (1) For a passenger-carrying airplane for which the application for 
the type certificate was filed prior to May 1, 1972, the location of 
each passenger emergency exit operating handle and instructions for 
opening the exit must be shown by a marking on or near the exit that is 
readable from a distance of 30 inches. In addition, for each Type I and 
Type II emergency exit with a locking mechanism released by rotary 
motion of the handle, the instructions for opening must be shown by--
    (i) A red arrow with a shaft at least \3/4\ inch wide and a head 
twice the width of the shaft, extending along at least 70 degrees of arc 
at a radius approximately equal to \3/4\ of the handle length; and
    (ii) The word ``open'' in red letters 1 inch high placed 
horizontally near the head of the arrow.
    (2) For a passenger-carrying airplane for which the application for 
the type certificate was filed on or after May 1, 1972, the location of 
each passenger emergency exit operating handle and instructions for 
opening the exit must be shown in accordance with the requirements under 
which the airplane was type certificated. On these airplanes, no 
operating handle or operating handle cover may continue to be used if 
its luminescence (brightness) decreases to below 100 microlamberts.
    (f) Emergency exit access. Access to emergency exits must be 
provided as follows for each passenger-carrying airplane:
    (1) Each passageway between individual passenger areas, or leading 
to a Type I or Type II emergency exit, must be unobstructed and at least 
20 inches wide.
    (2) There must be enough space next to each Type I or Type II 
emergency exit to allow a crewmember to assist in the evacuation of 
passengers without reducing the unobstructed width of the passageway 
below that required in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. However, the 
Administrator may authorize deviation from this requirement for an 
airplane certificated under the provisions of part 4b of the Civil Air 
Regulations in effect before December 20, 1951, if the Administrator 
finds that special circumstances exist that provide an equivalent level 
of safety.

[[Page 694]]

    (3) There must be access from the main aisle to each Type III and 
Type IV exit. The access from the aisle to these exits must not be 
obstructed by seats, berths, or other protrusions in a manner that would 
reduce the effectiveness of the exit. In addition--
    (i) For an airplane for which the application for the type 
certificate was filed prior to May 1, 1972, the access must meet the 
requirements of Sec. 25.813(c) of this chapter in effect on April 30, 
1972; and
    (ii) For an airplane for which the application for the type 
certificate was filed on or after May 1, 1972, the access must meet the 
emergency exit access requirements under which the airplane was 
certificated.
    (4) If it is necessary to pass through a passageway between 
passenger compartments to reach any required emergency exit from any 
seat in the passenger cabin, the passageway must not be obstructed. 
However, curtains may be used if they allow free entry through the 
passageway.
    (5) No door may be installed in any partition between passenger 
compartments.
    (6) If it is necessary to pass through a doorway separating the 
passenger cabin from other areas to reach any required emergency exit 
from any passenger seat, the door must have a means to latch it in open 
position, and the door must be latched open during each takeoff and 
landing. The latching means must be able to withstand the loads imposed 
upon it when the door is subjected to the ultimate interia forces, 
relative to the surrounding structure, listed in Sec. 25.561(b) of this 
chapter.
    (g) Exterior exit markings. Each passenger emergency exit and the 
means of opening that exit from the outside must be marked on the 
outside of the airplane. There must be a 2-inch colored band outlining 
each passenger emergency exit on the side of the fuselage. Each outside 
marking, including the band, must be readily distinguishable from the 
surrounding fuselage area by contrast in color. The markings must comply 
with the following:
    (1) If the reflectance of the darker color is 15 percent or less, 
the reflectance of the lighter color must be at least 45 percent. 
``Reflectance'' is the ratio of the luminous flux reflected by a body to 
the luminous flux it receives.
    (2) If the reflectance of the darker color is greater than 15 
percent, at least a 30 percent difference between its reflectance and 
the reflectance of the lighter color must be provided.
    (3) Exits that are not in the side of the fuselage must have the 
external means of opening and applicable instructions marked 
conspicuously in red or, if red is inconspicuous against the background 
color, in bright chrome yellow and, when the opening means for such an 
exit is located on only one side of the fuselage, a conspicuous marking 
to that effect must be provided on the other side.
    (h) Exterior emergency lighting and escape route.
    (1) Each passenger-carrying airplane must be equipped with exterior 
lighting that meets the following requirements:
    (i) For an airplane for which the application for the type 
certificate was filed prior to May 1, 1972, the requirements of Sec. 
25.812(f) and (g) of this chapter in effect on April 30, 1972.
    (ii) For an airplane for which the application for the type 
certificate was filed on or after May 1, 1972, the exterior emergency 
lighting requirements under which the airplane was type certificated.
    (2) Each passenger-carrying airplane must be equipped with a slip-
resistant escape route that meets the following requirements:
    (i) For an airplane for which the application for the type 
certificate was filed prior to May 1, 1972, the requirements of Sec. 
25.803(e) of this chapter in effect on April 30, 1972.
    (ii) For an airplane for which the application for the type 
certificate was filed on or after May 1, 1972, the slip-resistant escape 
route requirements under which the airplane was type certificated.
    (i) Floor level exits. Each floor level door or exit in the side of 
the fuselage (other than those leading into a cargo or baggage 
compartment that is not accessible from the passenger cabin) that is 44 
or more inches high and 20 or more inches wide, but not wider than 46 
inches, each passenger ventral exit (except the ventral exits on M-404 
and CV-240 airplanes) and each tail cone exit must meet the requirements 
of this section for floor level emergency exits. However, the 
Administrator may grant a deviation from this paragraph if the 
Administrator finds that circumstances make full compliance impractical 
and that an acceptable level of safety has been achieved.
    (j) Additional emergency exits. Approved emergency exits in the 
passenger compartments that are in excess of the minimum number of 
required emergency exits must meet all of the applicable provisions of 
this section except paragraph (f), (1), (2), and (3) and must be readily 
accessible.
    (k) On each large passenger-carrying turbojet-powered airplane, each 
ventral exit and tailcone exit must be--
    (1) Designed and constructed so that it cannot be opened during 
flight; and
    (2) Marked with a placard readable from a distance of 30 inches and 
installed at a conspicuous location near the means of opening the exit, 
stating that the exit has been designed and constructed so that it 
cannot be opened during flight.

    Appendix B to Part 125--Criteria for Demonstration of Emergency 
                Evacuation Procedures Under Sec. 125.189

    (a) Aborted takeoff demonstration.
    (1) The demonstration must be conducted either during the dark of 
the night or during daylight with the dark of the night simulated. If 
the demonstration is conducted indoors during daylight hours, it must be 
conducted with each window covered and each door closed to minimize the 
daylight effect. Illumination on the floor or ground may be used, but it 
must be kept low and shielded against shining into the airplane's 
windows or doors.
    (2) The airplane must be in a normal ground attitude with landing 
gear extended.
    (3) Stands or ramps may be used for descent from the wing to the 
ground. Safety equipment such as mats or inverted life rafts may be 
placed on the ground to protect participants. No other equipment that is 
not part of the airplane's emergency evacuation equipment may be used to 
aid the participants in reaching the ground.
    (4) The airplane's normal electric power sources must be 
deenergized.
    (5) All emergency equipment for the type of passenger-carrying 
operation involved must be installed in accordance with the certificate 
holder's manual.
    (6) Each external door and exit and each internal door or curtain 
must be in position to simulate a normal takeoff.
    (7) A representative passenger load of persons in normal health must 
be used. At least 30 percent must be females. At least 5 percent must be 
over 60 years of age with a proportionate number of females. At least 5 
percent, but not more than 10 percent, must be children under 12 years 
of age, prorated through that age group. Three life-size dolls, not 
included as part of the total passenger load, must be carried by 
passengers to simulate live infants 2 years old or young er. 
Crewmembers, mechanics, and training personnel who maintain or operate 
the airplane in the normal course of their duties may not be used as 
passengers.
    (8) No passenger may be assigned a specific seat except as the 
Administrator may require. Except as required by item (12) of this 
paragraph, no employee of the certificate holder may be seated next to 
an emergency exit.
    (9) Seat belts and shoulder harnesses (as required) must be 
fastened.
    (10) Before the start of the demonstration, approximately one-half 
of the total average amount of carry-on baggage, blankets, pillows, and 
other similar articles must be distributed at several locations in the 
aisles and emergency exit access ways to create minor obstructions.
    (11) The seating density and arrangement of the airplane must be 
representative of the highest capacity passenger version of that 
airplane the certificate holder operates or proposes to operate.
    (12) Each crewmember must be a member of a regularly scheduled line 
crew, must be seated in that crewmember's normally assigned seat for 
takeoff, and must remain in that seat until the signal for commencement 
of the demonstration is received.
    (13) No crewmember or passenger may be given prior knowledge of the 
emergency exits available for the demonstration.
    (14) The certificate holder may not practice, rehearse, or describe 
the demonstration for the participants nor may any participant have 
taken part in this type of demonstration within the preceding 6 months.
    (15) The pretakeoff passenger briefing required by Sec. 125.327 may 
be given in accordance with the certificate holder's manual. The 
passengers may also be warned to follow directions of crewmembers, but 
may not be instructed on the procedures to be followed in the 
demonstration.
    (16) If safety equipment as allowed by item (3) of this section is 
provided, either all passenger and cockpit windows must be blacked out 
or all of the emergency exits must have safety equipment to prevent 
disclosure of the available emergency exits.
    (17) Not more than 50 percent of the emergency exits in the sides of 
the fuselage of an airplane that meet all of the requirements applicable 
to the required emergency exits for that airplane may be used for the 
demonstration. Exits that are not to be used in the demonstration must 
have the exit handle deactivated or must be indicated by red lights, red 
tape or other acceptable means, placed outside the exits to indicate 
fire or other reason that they are unusable. The exits to be used must 
be representative of all of the emergency exits on the airplane and must 
be designated by the certificate holder, subject to approval by the 
Administrator. At least one floor level exit must be used.
    (18) All evacuees, except those using an over-the-wing exit, must 
leave the airplane by a means provided as part of the airplane's 
equipment.
    (19) The certificate holder's approved procedures and all of the 
emergency equipment that is normally available, including slides, ropes, 
lights, and megaphones, must be fully utilized during the demonstration.
    (20) The evacuation time period is completed when the last occupant 
has evacuated the airplane and is on the ground. Evac uees using stands 
or ramps allowed by item (3) above are considered to be on the ground 
when they are on the stand or ramp: Provided, That the acceptance rate 
of the stand or ramp is no greater than the acceptance rate of the means 
available on the airplane

[[Page 696]]

for descent from the wing during an actual crash situation.
    (b) Ditching demonstration. The demonstration must assume that 
daylight hours exist outside the airplane and that all required 
crewmembers are available for the demonstration.
    (1) If the certificate holder's manual requires the use of 
passengers to assist in the launching of liferafts, the needed 
passengers must be aboard the airplane and participate in the 
demonstration according to the manual.
    (2) A stand must be placed at each emergency exit and wing with the 
top of the platform at a height simulating the water level of the 
airplane following a ditching.
    (3) After the ditching signal has been received, each evacuee must 
don a life vest according to the certificate holder's manual.
    (4) Each liferaft must be launched and inflated according to the 
certificate holder's manual and all other required emergency equipment 
must be placed in rafts.
    (5) Each evacuee must enter a liferaft and the crewmembers assigned 
to each liferaft must indicate the location of emergency equipment 
aboard the raft and describe its use.
    (6) Either the airplane, a mockup of the airplane, or a floating 
device simulating a passenger compartment must be used.
    (i) If a mockup of the airplane is used, it must be a life-size 
mockup of the interior and representative of the airplane currently used 
by or proposed to be used by the certificate holder and must contain 
adequate seats for use of the evacuees. Operation of the emergency exits 
and the doors must closely simulate that on the airplane. Sufficient 
wing area must be installed outside the over-the-wing exits to 
demonstrate the evacuation.
    (ii) If a floating device simulating a passenger compartment is 
used, it must be representative, to the extent possible, of the 
passenger compartment of the airplane used in operations. Operation of 
the emergency exits and the doors must closely simulate operation on 
that airplane. Sufficient wing area must be installed outside the over-
the-wing exits to demonstrate the evacuation. The device must be 
equipped with the same survival equipment as is installed on the 
airplane, to accommodate all persons participating in the demonstration.

                 Appendix C to Part 125--Ice Protection

    If certification with ice protection provisions is desired, 
compliance with the following must be shown:
    (a) The recommended procedures for the use of the ice protection 
equipment must be set forth in the Airplane Flight Manual.
    (b) An analysis must be performed to establish, on the basis of the 
airplane's operational needs, the adequacy of the ice protection system 
for the various components of the airplane. In addition, tests of the 
ice protection system must be conducted to demonstrate that the airplane 
is capable of operating safely in continuous maximum and intermittent 
maximum icing conditions as described in appendix C of part 25 of this 
chapter.
    (c) Compliance with all or portions of this section may be 
accomplished by reference, where applicable because of similarity of the 
designs, to analyses and tests performed by the applicant for a type 
certificated model.

\3\ For airplanes that can demonstrate the capability of deriving either the control input on control movement
  (one from the other) for all modes of operation and flight regimes, the ``or'' applies. For airplanes with non-
  mechanical control systems (fly-by-wire) the ``and'' applies. In airplanes with split surfaces, suitable
  combination of inputs is acceptable in lieu of recording each surface separately.

    (c) Before a person may operate a rotorcraft with an external-load 
configuration that differs substantially from any that person has 
previously carried with that type of rotorcraft (whether or not the 
rotorcraft-load combination is of the same class), that person must 
conduct, in a manner that will not endanger persons or property on the 
surface, such of the following flight-operational checks as the 
Administrator determines are appropriate to the rotorcraft-load 
combination:
    (1) A determination that the weight of the rotorcraft-load 
combination and the location of its center of gravity are within 
approved limits, that the external load is securely fastened, and that 
the external load does not interfere with devices provided for its 
emergency release.
    (2) Make an initial liftoff and verify that controllability is 
satisfactory.
    (3) While hovering, verify that directional control is adequate.
    (4) Accelerate into forward flight to verify that no attitude 
(whether of the rotorcraft or of the external load) is encountered in 
which the rotorcraft is uncontrollable or which is otherwise hazardous.
    (5) In forward flight, check for hazardous oscillations of the 
external load, but if the external load is not visible to the pilot, 
other crewmembers or ground personnel may make this check and signal the 
pilot.
    (6) Increase the forward airspeed and determine an operational 
airspeed at which no hazardous oscillation or hazardous aerodynamic 
turbulence is encountered.
    (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of part 91 of this chapter, the 
holder of a Rotorcraft External-Load Operator Certificate may conduct 
(in rotorcraft type certificated under and meeting the requirements of 
part 27 or 29 of this chapter, including the external-load attaching 
means) rotorcraft external-load operations over congested areas if those 
operations are conducted without hazard to persons or property on the 
surface and comply with the following:
    (1) The operator must develop a plan for each complete operation, 
coordinate this plan with the FAA Flight Standards District Office 
having jurisdiction over the area in which the operation will be 
conducted, and obtain approval for the operation from that district 
office. The plan must include an agreement with the appropriate 
political subdivision that local officials will exclude unauthorized 
persons from the area in which the operation will be conducted, 
coordination with air traffic control, if necessary, and a detailed 
chart depicting the flight routes and altitudes.
    (2) Each flight must be conducted at an altitude, and on a route, 
that will allow a jettisonable external load to be released, and the 
rotorcraft landed, in an emergency without hazard to persons or property 
on the surface.
    (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of part 91 of this chapter, and 
except as provided in Sec. 133.45(d), the holder of a Rotorcraft 
External-Load Operator Certificate may conduct external-load operations, 
including approaches, departures, and load positioning maneuvers 
necessary for the operation, below 500 feet above the surface and closer 
than 500 feet to persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures, if the 
operations

Sec. 135.178  Additional emergency equipment.

    No person may operate an airplane having a passenger seating 
configuration of more than 19 seats, unless it has the additional 
emergency equipment specified in paragraphs (a) through (l) of this 
section.
    (a) Means for emergency evacuation. Each passenger-carrying 
landplane emergency exit (other than over-the-wing) that is more than 6 
feet from the ground, with the airplane on the ground and the landing 
gear extended, must have an approved means to assist the occupants in 
descending to the ground. The assisting means for a floor-level 
emergency exit must meet the requirements of Sec. 25.809(f)(1) of this 
chapter in effect on April 30, 1972, except that, for any airplane for 
which the application for the type certificate was filed after that 
date, it must meet the requirements under which the airplane was type 
certificated. An assisting means that deploys automatically must be 
armed during taxiing, takeoffs, and landings; however, the Administrator 
may grant a deviation from the requirement of automatic deployment if he 
finds that the design of the exit makes compliance impractical, if the 
assisting means automatically erects upon deployment and, with respect 
to required emergency exits, if an emergency evacuation demonstration is 
conducted in accordance with Sec. 121.291(a) of this chapter. This 
paragraph does not apply to the rear window emergency exit of Douglas 
DC-3 airplanes operated with fewer than 36 occupants, including 
crewmembers, and fewer than five exits authorized for passenger use.
    (b) Interior emergency exit marking. The following must be complied 
with for each passenger-carrying airplane:
    (1) Each passenger emergency exit, its means of access, and its 
means of opening must be conspicuously marked. The identity and locating 
of each passenger emergency exit must be recognizable from a distance 
equal to the width of the cabin. The location of each passenger 
emergency exit must be indicated by a sign visible to occupants 
approaching along the main passenger aisle. There must be a locating 
sign--
    (i) Above the aisle near each over-the-wing passenger emergency 
exit, or at another ceiling location if it is more practical because of 
low headroom;

[[Page 764]]

    (ii) Next to each floor level passenger emergency exit, except that 
one sign may serve two such exits if they both can be seen readily from 
that sign; and
    (iii) On each bulkhead or divider that prevents fore and aft vision 
along the passenger cabin, to indicate emergency exits beyond and 
obscured by it, except that if this is not possible, the sign may be 
placed at another appropriate location.
    (2) Each passenger emergency exit marking and each locating sign 
must meet the following:
    (i) For an airplane for which the application for the type 
certificate was filed prior to May 1, 1972, each passenger emergency 
exit marking and each locating sign must be manufactured to meet the 
requirements of Sec. 25.812(b) of this chapter in effect on April 30, 
1972. On these airplanes, no sign may continue to be used if its 
luminescence (brightness) decreases to below 100 microlamberts. The 
colors may be reversed if it increases the emergency illumination of the 
passenger compartment. However, the Administrator may authorize 
deviation from the 2-inch background requirements if he finds that 
special circumstances exist that make compliance impractical and that 
the proposed deviation provides an equivalent level of safety.
    (ii) For an airplane for which the application for the type 
certificate was filed on or after May 1, 1972, each passenger emergency 
exit marking and each locating sign must be manufactured to meet the 
interior emergency exit marking requirements under which the airplane 
was type certificated. On these airplanes, no sign may continue to be 
used if its luminescence (brightness) decreases to below 250 
microlamberts.
    (c) Lighting for interior emergency exit markings. Each passenger-
carrying airplane must have an emergency lighting system, independent of 
the main lighting system; however, sources of general cabin illumination 
may be common to both the emergency and the main lighting systems if the 
power supply to the emergency lighting system is independent of the 
power supply to the main lighting system. The emergency lighting system 
must--
    (1) Illuminate each passenger exit marking and locating sign;
    (2) Provide enough general lighting in the passenger cabin so that 
the average illumination when measured at 40-inch intervals at seat 
armrest height, on the centerline of the main passenger aisle, is at 
least 0.05 foot-candles; and
    (3) For airplanes type certificated after January 1, 1958, include 
floor proximity emergency escape path marking which meets the 
requirements of Sec. 25.812(e) of this chapter in effect on November 
26, 1984.
    (d) Emergency light operation. Except for lights forming part of 
emergency lighting subsystems provided in compliance with Sec. 
25.812(h) of this chapter (as prescribed in paragraph (h) of this 
section) that serve no more than one assist means, are independent of 
the airplane's main emergency lighting systems, and are automatically 
activated when the assist means is deployed, each light required by 
paragraphs (c) and (h) of this section must:
    (1) Be operable manually both from the flightcrew station and from a 
point in the passenger compartment that is readily accessible to a 
normal flight attendant seat;
    (2) Have a means to prevent inadvertent operation of the manual 
controls;
    (3) When armed or turned on at either station, remain lighted or 
become lighted upon interruption of the airplane's normal electric 
power;
    (4) Be armed or turned on during taxiing, takeoff, and landing. In 
showing compliance with this paragraph, a transverse vertical separation 
of the fuselage need not be considered;
    (5) Provide the required level of illumination for at least 10 
minutes at the critical ambient conditions after emergency landing; and
    (6) Have a cockpit control device that has an ``on,'' ``off,'' and 
``armed'' position.
    (e) Emergency exit operating handles. (1) For a passenger-carrying 
airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed 
prior to May 1, 1972, the location of each passenger emergency exit 
operating handle, and instructions for opening the exit, must be shown 
by a marking on or near the exit that is readable from a distance of

[[Page 765]]

30 inches. In addition, for each Type I and Type II emergency exit with 
a locking mechanism released by rotary motion of the handle, the 
instructions for opening must be shown by--
    (i) A red arrow with a shaft at least three-fourths inch wide and a 
head twice the width of the shaft, extending along at least 70[deg] of 
arc at a radius approximately equal to three-fourths of the handle 
length; and
    (ii) The word ``open'' in red letters 1 inch high placed 
horizontally near the head of the arrow.
    (2) For a passenger-carrying airplane for which the application for 
the type certificate was filed on or after May 1, 1972, the location of 
each passenger emergency exit operating handle and instructions for 
opening the exit must be shown in accordance with the requirements under 
which the airplane was type certificated. On these airplanes, no 
operating handle or operating handle cover may continue to be used if 
its luminescence (brightness) decreases to below 100 microlamberts.
    (f) Emergency exit access. Access to emergency exits must be 
provided as follows for each passenger-carrying airplane:
    (1) Each passageway between individual passenger areas, or leading 
to a Type I or Type II emergency exit, must be unobstructed and at least 
20 inches wide.
    (2) There must be enough space next to each Type I or Type II 
emergency exit to allow a crewmember to assist in the evacuation of 
passengers without reducing the unobstructed width of the passageway 
below that required in paragraph (f)(1) of this section; however, the 
Administrator may authorize deviation from this requirement for an 
airplane certificated under the provisions of part 4b of the Civil Air 
Regulations in effect before December 20, 1951, if he finds that special 
circumstances exist that provide an equivalent level of safety.
    (3) There must be access from the main aisle to each Type III and 
Type IV exit. The access from the aisle to these exits must not be 
obstructed by seats, berths, or other protrusions in a manner that would 
reduce the effectiveness of the exit. In addition, for a transport 
category airplane type certificated after January 1, 1958, there must be 
placards installed in accordance with Sec. 25.813(c)(3) of this chapter 
for each Type III exit after December 3, 1992.
    (4) If it is necessary to pass through a passageway between 
passenger compartments to reach any required emergency exit from any 
seat in the passenger cabin, the passageway must not be obstructed. 
Curtains may, however, be used if they allow free entry through the 
passageway.
    (5) No door may be installed in any partition between passenger 
compartments.
    (6) If it is necessary to pass through a doorway separating the 
passenger cabin from other areas to reach a required emergency exit from 
any passenger seat, the door must have a means to latch it in the open 
position, and the door must be latched open during each takeoff and 
landing. The latching means must be able to withstand the loads imposed 
upon it when the door is subjected to the ultimate inertia forces, 
relative to the surrounding structure, listed in Sec. 25.561(b) of this 
chapter.
    (g) Exterior exit markings. Each passenger emergency exit and the 
means of opening that exit from the outside must be marked on the 
outside of the airplane. There must be a 2-inch colored band outlining 
each passenger emergency exit on the side of the fuselage. Each outside 
marking, including the band, must be readily distinguishable from the 
surrounding fuselage area by contrast in color. The markings must comply 
with the following:
    (1) If the reflectance of the darker color is 15 percent or less, 
the reflectance of the lighter color must be at least 45 percent.
    (2) If the reflectance of the darker color is greater than 15 
percent, at least a 30 percent difference between its reflectance and 
the reflectance of the lighter color must be provided.
    (3) Exits that are not in the side of the fuselage must have the 
external means of opening and applicable instructions marked 
conspicuously in red or, if red is inconspicuous against the background 
color, in bright chrome yellow and, when the opening means for such an 
exit is located on only one

[[Page 766]]

side of the fuselage, a conspicuous marking to that effect must be 
provided on the other side. ``Reflectance'' is the ratio of the luminous 
flux reflected by a body to the luminous flux it receives.
    (h) Exterior emergency lighting and escape route. (1) Each 
passenger-carrying airplane must be equipped with exterior lighting that 
meets the following requirements:

observations made and furnished to pilots to conduct IFR operations at 
an airport must be taken at the airport where those IFR operations are 
conducted, unless the Administrator issues operations specifications 
allowing the use of weather observations taken at a location not at the 
airport where the IFR operations are conducted. The Administrator issues 
such operations specifications when, after investigation by the U.S. 
National Weather Service and the certificate-holding district office, it 
is found that the standards of safety for that operation would allow the 
deviation from this paragraph for a particular operation for which an 
air carrier operating certificate or operating certificate has been 
issued.

Sec. 135.273  Duty period limitations and rest time requirements.

    (a) For purposes of this section--
    Calendar day means the period of elapsed time, using Coordinated 
Universal Time or local time, that begins at midnight and ends 24 hours 
later at the next midnight.
    Duty period means the period of elapsed time between reporting for 
an assignment involving flight time and release from that assignment by 
the certificate holder. The time is calculated using either Coordinated 
Universal Time or local time to reflect the total elapsed time.
    Flight attendant means an individual, other than a flight 
crewmember, who is assigned by the certificate holder, in accordance 
with the required minimum crew complement under the certificate holder's 
operations specifications or in addition to that minimum complement, to 
duty in an aircraft during flight time and whose duties include but are 
not necessarily limited to cabin-safety-related responsibilities.
    Rest period means the period free of all responsibility for work or 
duty should the occasion arise.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a 
certificate holder may assign a duty period to a flight attendant only 
when the applicable duty period limitations and rest requirements of 
this paragraph are met.
    (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of 
this section, no certificate holder may assign a flight attendant to a 
scheduled duty period of more than 14 hours.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a flight 
attendant scheduled to a duty period of 14 hours or less as provided 
under paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be given a scheduled rest 
period of at least 9 consecutive hours. This rest period must

[[Page 782]]

occur between the completion of the scheduled duty period and the 
commencement of the subsequent duty period.
    (3) The rest period required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section 
may be scheduled or reduced to 8 consecutive hours if the flight 
attendant is provided a subsequent rest period of at least 10 
consecutive hours; this subsequent rest period must be scheduled to 
begin no later than 24 hours after the beginning of the reduced rest 
period and must occur between the completion of the scheduled duty 
period and the commencement of the subsequent duty period.
    (4) A certificate holder may assign a flight attendant to a 
scheduled duty period of more than 14 hours, but no more than 16 hours, 
if the certificate holder has assigned to the flight or flights in that 
duty period at least one flight attendant in addition to the minimum 
flight attendant complement required for the flight or flights in that 
duty period under the certificate holder's operations specifications.
    (5) A certificate holder may assign a flight attendant to a 
scheduled duty period of more than 16 hours, but no more than 18 hours, 
if the certificate holder has assigned to the flight or flights in that 
duty period at least two flight attendants in addition to the minimum 
flight attendant complement required for the flight or flights in that 
duty period under the certificate holder's operations specifications.
    (6) A certificate holder may assign a flight attendant to a 
scheduled duty period of more than 18 hours, but no more than 20 hours, 
if the scheduled duty period includes one or more flights that land or 
take off outside the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia, 
and if the certificate holder has assigned to the flight or flights in 
that duty period at least three flight attendants in addition to the 
minimum flight attendant complement required for the flight or flights 
in that duty period under the certificate holder's operations 
specifications.
    (7) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8) of this section, a flight 
attendant scheduled to a duty period of more than 14 hours but no more 
than 20 hours, as provided in paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of 
this section, must be given a scheduled rest period of at least 12 
consecutive hours. This rest period must occur between the completion of 
the scheduled duty period and the commencement of the subsequent duty 
period.
    (8) The rest period required under paragraph (b)(7) of this section 
may be scheduled or reduced to 10 consecutive hours if the flight 
attendant is provided a subsequent rest period of at least 14 
consecutive hours; this subsequent rest period must be scheduled to 
begin no later than 24 hours after the beginning of the reduced rest 
period and must occur between the completion of the scheduled duty 
period and the commencement of the subsequent duty period.
    (9) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of this 
section, if a certificate holder elects to reduce the rest period to 10 
hours as authorized by paragraph (b)(8) of this section, the certificate 
holder may not schedule a flight attendant for a duty period of more 
than 14 hours during the 24-hour period commencing after the beginning 
of the reduced rest period.
    (10) No certificate holder may assign a flight attendant any duty 
period with the certificate holder unless the flight attendant has had 
at least the minimum rest required under this section.
    (11) No certificate holder may assign a flight attendant to perform 
any duty with the certificate holder during any required rest period.
    (12) Time spent in transportation, not local in character, that a 
certificate holder requires of a flight attendant and provides to 
transport the flight attendant to an airport at which that flight 
attendant is to serve on a flight as a crewmember, or from an airport at 
which the flight attendant was relieved from duty to return to the 
flight attendant's home station, is not considered part of a rest 
period.
    (13) Each certificate holder must relieve each flight attendant 
engaged in air transportation from all further duty for at least 24 
consecutive hours during any 7 consecutive calendar days.
    (14) A flight attendant is not considered to be scheduled for duty 
in excess of duty period limitations if the flights

[[Page 783]]

to which the flight attendant is assigned are scheduled and normally 
terminate within the limitations but due to circumstances beyond the 
control of the certificate holder (such as adverse weather conditions) 
are not at the time of departure expected to reach their destination 
within the scheduled time.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, a certificate 
holder may apply the flight crewmember flight time and duty limitations 
and rest requirements of this part to flight attendants for all 
operations conducted under this part provided that--
    (1) The certificate holder establishes written procedures that--
    (i) Apply to all flight attendants used in the certificate holder's 
operation;
    (ii) Include the flight crewmember requirements contained in subpart 
F of this part, as appropriate to the operation being conducted, except 
that rest facilities on board the aircraft are not required; and
    (iii) Include provisions to add one flight attendant to the minimum 
flight attendant complement for each flight crewmember who is in excess 
of the minimum number required in the aircraft type certificate data 
sheet and who is assigned to the aircraft under the provisions of 
subpart F of this part, as applicable.
    (iv) Are approved by the Administrator and described or referenced 
in the certificate holder's operations specifications; and
    (2) Whenever the Administrator finds that revisions are necessary 
for the continued adequacy of duty period limitation and rest 
requirement procedures that are required by paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section and that had been granted final approval, the certificate holder 
must, after notification by the Administrator, make any changes in the 
procedures that are found necessary by the Administrator. Within 30 days 
after the certificate holder receives such notice, it may file a 
petition to reconsider the notice with the certificate-holding district 
office. The filing of a petition to reconsider stays the notice, pending 
decision by the Administrator. However, if the Administrator finds that 
there is an emergency that requires immediate action in the interest of 
safety, the Administrator may, upon a statement of the reasons, require 
a change effective without stay.

calendar month before that use, the pilot has satisfactorily 
demonstrated either that type of approach procedure or any other two 
different types of nonprecision approach procedures. The instrument 
approach procedure or procedures must include at least one straight-in 
approach, one circling approach, and one missed approach. Each type of 
approach procedure demonstrated must be conducted to published minimums 
for that procedure.
    (c) The instrument proficiency check required by paragraph (a) of 
this section consists of an oral or written equipment test and a flight 
check under simulated or actual IFR conditions. The equipment test 
includes questions on emergency procedures, engine operation, fuel and 
lubrication systems, power settings, stall speeds, best engine-out 
speed, propeller and supercharger operations, and hydraulic, mechanical, 
and electrical systems, as appropriate. The flight check includes 
navigation by instruments, recovery from simulated emergencies, and 
standard instrument approaches involving navigational facilities which 
that pilot is to be authorized to use. Each pilot taking the instrument 
proficiency check must show that standard of competence required by 
Sec. 135.293(d).
    (1) The instrument proficiency check must--
    (i) For a pilot in command of an airplane under Sec. 135.243(a), 
include the procedures and maneuvers for an airline transport pilot 
certificate in the particular type of airplane, if appropriate; and
    (ii) For a pilot in command of an airplane or helicopter under Sec. 
135.243(c), include the procedures and maneuvers for a commercial pilot 
certificate with an instrument rating and, if required, for the 
appropriate type rating.
    (2) The instrument proficiency check must be given by an authorized 
check airman or by the Administrator.
    (d) If the pilot in command is assigned to pilot only one type of 
aircraft, that pilot must take the instrument proficiency check required 
by paragraph (a) of this section in that type of aircraft.
    (e) If the pilot in command is assigned to pilot more than one type 
of aircraft, that pilot must take the instrument proficiency check 
required by paragraph (a) of this section in each type of aircraft to 
which that pilot is assigned, in rotation, but not more than one flight 
check during each period described in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (f) If the pilot in command is assigned to pilot both single-engine 
and multiengine aircraft, that pilot must initially take the instrument 
proficiency check required by paragraph (a) of this section in a

simulator or other appropriate training device, if approved by the 
Administrator.
    (g) If the pilot in command is authorized to use an autopilot system 
in place of a second in command, that pilot must show, during the 
required instrument proficiency check, that the pilot is able (without a 
second in command) both with and without using the autopilot to--
    (1) Conduct instrument operations competently; and
    (2) Properly conduct air-ground communications and comply with 
complex air traffic control instructions.
    (3) Each pilot taking the autopilot check must show that, while 
using the autopilot, the airplane can be operated as proficiently as it 
would be if a second in command were present to handle air-ground 
communications and air traffic control instructions. The autopilot check 
need only be demonstrated once every 12 calendar months during the 
instrument proficiency check required under paragraph (a) of this 
section.

    (a) No certificate holder may use a pilot, nor may any person serve, 
as a pilot in command of a flight unless, since the beginning of the 
12th calendar month before that service, that pilot has passed a flight 
check in one of the types of aircraft which that pilot is to fly. The 
flight check shall--
    (1) Be given by an approved check pilot or by the Administrator;
    (2) Consist of at least one flight over one route segment; and
    (3) Include takeoffs and landings at one or more representative 
airports. In addition to the requirements of this paragraph, for a pilot 
authorized to conduct IFR operations, at least one flight shall be flown 
over a civil airway, an approved off-airway route, or a portion of 
either of them.
    (b) The pilot who conducts the check shall determine whether the 
pilot being checked satisfactorily performs the duties and 
responsibilities of a pilot in command in operations under this part, 
and shall so certify in the pilot training record.
    (c) Each certificate holder shall establish in the manual required 
by Sec. 135.21 a procedure which will ensure that each pilot who has 
not flown over a route and into an airport within the preceding 90 days 
will, before beginning the flight, become familiar with all available 
information required for the safe operation of that flight.

          Subpart I_Airplane Performance Operating Limitations


<R05>
Sec. 135.361  Applicability.

    (a) This subpart prescribes airplane performance operating 
limitations applicable to the operation of the categories of airplanes 
listed in Sec. 135.363 when operated under this part.
    (b) For the purpose of this subpart, effective length of the runway, 
for landing means the distance from the point at which the obstruction 
clearance plane associated with the approach end of the runway 
intersects the centerline of the runway to the far end of the runway.
    (c) For the purpose of this subpart, obstruction clearance plane 
means a plane sloping upward from the runway at a slope of 1:20 to the 
horizontal, and tangent to or clearing all obstructions within a 
specified area surrounding the runway as shown in a profile view of that 
area. In the plan view, the centerline of the specified area coincides 
with the centerline of the runway, beginning at the point where the 
obstruction clearance plane intersects the centerline of the runway and 
proceeding to a point at least 1,500 feet from the beginning point. 
After that the centerline coincides with the takeoff path over the 
ground for the runway (in the case of takeoffs) or with the instrument 
approach counterpart (for landings), or, where the applicable one of 
these paths has not been established, it proceeds consistent with turns 
of at least 4,000-foot radius until a point is reached beyond which the 
obstruction clearance plane clears all obstructions. This area extends 
laterally 200 feet on each side of the centerline at the point where the 
obstruction clearance plane intersects the runway and continues at this 
width to the end of the runway; then it increases uniformly to 500 feet 
on each side of the centerline at a point 1,500 feet from the 
intersection of the obstruction clearance plane with the runway; after 
that it extends laterally 500 feet on each side of the centerline.

Sec. 135.363  General.

    (a) Each certificate holder operating a reciprocating engine powered 
large transport category airplane shall comply with Sec. Sec. 135.365 
through 135.377.

[[Page 798]]

    (b) Each certificate holder operating a turbine engine powered large 
transport category airplane shall comply with Sec. Sec. 135.379 through 
135.387, except that when it operates a turbopropeller-powered large 
transport category airplane certificated after August 29, 1959, but 
previously type certificated with the same number of reciprocating 
engines, it may comply with Sec. Sec. 135.365 through 135.377.
    (c) Each certificate holder operating a large nontransport category 
airplane shall comply with Sec. Sec. 135.389 through 135.395 and any 
determination of compliance must be based only on approved performance 
data. For the purpose of this subpart, a large nontrans- port category 
airplane is an airplane that was type certificated before July 1, 1942.
    (d) Each certificate holder operating a small transport category 
airplane shall comply with Sec. 135.397.
    (e) Each certificate holder operating a small nontransport category 
airplane shall comply with Sec. 135.399.
    (f) The performance data in the Airplane Flight Manual applies in 
determining compliance with Sec. Sec. 135.365 through 135.387. Where 
conditions are different from those on which the performance data is 
based, compliance is determined by interpolation or by computing the 
effects of change in the specific variables, if the results of the 
interpolation or computations are substantially as accurate as the 
results of direct tests.
    (g) No person may take off a reciprocating engine powered large 
transport category airplane at a weight that is more than the allowable 
weight for the runway being used (determined under the runway takeoff 
limitations of the transport category operating rules of this subpart) 
after taking into account the temperature operating correction factors 
in section 4a.749a-T or section 4b.117 of the Civil Air Regulations in 
effect on January 31, 1965, and in the applicable Airplane Flight 
Manual.
    (h) The Administrator may author- ize in the operations 
specifications deviations from this subpart if special circumstances 
make a literal observ- ance of a requirement unnecessary for safety.
    (i) The 10-mile width specified in Sec. Sec. 135.369 through 
135.373 may be reduced to 5 miles, for not more than 20 miles, when 
operating under VFR or where navigation facilities furnish reliable and 
accurate identification of high ground and obstructions located outside 
of 5 miles, but within 10 miles, on each side of the intended track.
    (j) Each certificate holder operating a commuter category airplane 
shall comply with Sec. 135.398.

powered large transport category airplane concerned.
    (d) No person may take off a reciprocating engine powered large 
transport category airplane at a weight more than the maximum authorized 
takeoff weight for the elevation of the airport.
    (e) No person may take off a reciprocating engine powered large 
transport category airplane if its weight on arrival at the airport of 
destination will be more than the maximum authorized landing weight for 
the elevation of that airport, allowing for normal consumption of fuel 
and oil en route.

category airplane may take off that airplane unless it is possible--
    (1) To stop the airplane safely on the runway, as shown by the 
accelerate-stop distance data, at any time during takeoff until reaching 
critical-engine failure speed;
    (2) If the critical engine fails at any time after the airplane 
reaches critical-engine failure speed V<INF>1</INF>, to continue the 
takeoff and reach a height of 50 feet, as indicated by the takeoff path 
data, before passing over the end of the runway; and
    (3) To clear all obstacles either by at least 50 feet vertically (as 
shown by the takeoff path data) or 200 feet horizontally within the 
airport boundaries and 300 feet horizontally beyond the boundaries, 
without banking before reaching a height of 50 feet (as shown by the 
takeoff path data) and after that without banking more than 15 degrees.
    (b) In applying this section, corrections must be made for any 
runway gradient. To allow for wind effect, takeoff data based on still 
air may be corrected by taking into account not more than 50 percent of 
any reported headwind component and not less than 150 percent of any 
reported tailwind component.


<R05>
Sec. 135.369  Large transport category airplanes: Reciprocating engine 
powered: En route limitations: All engines operating.

    (a) No person operating a reciprocating engine powered large 
transport category airplane may take off that airplane at a weight, 
allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil, that does not allow a 
rate of climb (in feet per minute), with all engines operating, of at 
least 6.90 Vs<INF>o</INF> (that is, the number of feet per minute 
obtained by multiplying the number of knots by 6.90) at an altitude of a 
least 1,000 feet above the highest ground or obstruction within ten 
miles of each side of the intended track.
    (b) This section does not apply to large transport category 
airplanes certificated under part 4a of the Civil Air Regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 135.371  Large transport category airplanes: Reciprocating engine 
powered: En route limitations: One engine inoperative.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no person 
operating a reciprocating engine powered large transport category 
airplane may take off that airplane at a weight, allowing for normal 
consumption of fuel and oil, that does not allow a rate of climb (in 
feet per minute), with one engine inoperative, of at least (0.079-0.106/
N) Vs<INF>o</INF>2 (where N is the number of engines installed and 
Vs<INF>o</INF> is expressed in knots) at an altitude of least 1,000 feet 
above the highest ground or obstruction within 10 miles of each side of 
the intended track. However, for the purposes of this paragraph the rate 
of climb for transport category airplanes certificated under part 4a of 
the Civil Air Regulations is 0.026 Vs<INF>o</INF>2.
    (b) In place of the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a 
person may, under an approved procedure, operate a reciprocating engine 
powered large transport category airplane at an all-engines-operating 
altitude that allows the airplane to continue, after an engine failure, 
to an alternate airport where a landing can be made under Sec. 135.377, 
allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil. After the assumed 
failure, the flight path must clear the ground and any obstruction 
within five miles on each side of the intended track by at least 2,000 
feet.
    (c) If an approved procedure under paragraph (b) of this section is 
used, the certificate holder shall comply with the following:
    (1) The rate of climb (as prescribed in the Airplane Flight Manual 
for the appropriate weight and altitude) used in calculating the 
airplane's flight path shall be diminished by an amount in feet per 
minute, equal to (0.079-0.106/N) Vs<INF>o</INF>2 (when N is the number 
of engines installed and Vs<INF>o</INF> is expressed in knots) for 
airplanes certificated under part 25 of this chapter and by 0.026 
Vs<INF>o</INF>2 for airplanes certificated under part 4a of the Civil 
Air Regulations.
    (2) The all-engines-operating altitude shall be sufficient so that 
in the event the critical engine becomes inoperative at any point along 
the route, the flight

[[Page 800]]

will be able to proceed to a predetermined alternate airport by use of 
this procedure. In determining the takeoff weight, the airplane is 
assumed to pass over the critical obstruction following engine failure 
at a point no closer to the critical obstruction than the nearest 
approved radio navigational fix, unless the Administrator approves a 
procedure established on a different basis upon finding that adequate 
operational safeguards exist.
    (3) The airplane must meet the provisions of paragraph (a) of this 
section at 1,000 feet above the airport used as an alternate in this 
procedure.
    (4) The procedure must include an approved method of accounting for 
winds and temperatures that would otherwise adversely affect the flight 
path.
    (5) In complying with this procedure, fuel jettisoning is allowed if 
the certificate holder shows that it has an adequate training program, 
that proper instructions are given to the flight crew, and all other 
precautions are taken to ensure a safe procedure.
    (6) The certificate holder and the pilot in command shall jointly 
elect an alternate airport for which the appropriate weather reports or 
forecasts, or any combination of them, indicate that weather conditions 
will be at or above the alternate weather minimum specified in the 
certificate holder's operations specifications for that airport when the 
flight arrives.


<R05>
Sec. 135.373  Part 25 transport category airplanes with four or more 

engines: Reciprocating engine powered: En route limitations: Two engines 
inoperative.

    (a) No person may operate an airplane certificated under part 25 and 
having four or more engines unless--
    (1) There is no place along the intended track that is more than 90 
minutes (with all engines operating at cruising power) from an airport 
that meets Sec. 135.377; or
    (2) It is operated at a weight allowing the airplane, with the two 
critical engines inoperative, to climb at 0.013 Vs<INF>o</INF>2 feet per 
minute (that is, the number of feet per minute obtained by multiplying 
the number of knots squared by 0.013) at an altitude of 1,000 feet above 
the highest ground or obstruction within 10 miles on each side of the 
intended track, or at an altitude of 5,000 feet, whichever is higher.
    (b) For the purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it is 
assumed that--
    (1) The two engines fail at the point that is most critical with 
respect to the takeoff weight;
    (2) Consumption of fuel and oil is normal with all engines operating 
up to the point where the two engines fail with two engines operating 
beyond that point;
    (3) Where the engines are assumed to fail at an altitude above the 
prescribed minimum altitude, compliance with the prescribed rate of 
climb at the prescribed minimum altitude need not be shown during the 
descent from the cruising altitude to the prescribed minimum altitude, 
if those requirements can be met once the prescribed minimum altitude is 
reached, and assuming descent to be along a net flight path and the rate 
of descent to be 0.013 Vs<INF>o</INF>2 greater than the rate in the 
approved performance data; and
    (4) If fuel jettisoning is provided, the airplane's weight at the 
point where the two engines fail is considered to be not less than that 
which would include enough fuel to proceed to an airport meeting Sec. 
135.377 and to arrive at an altitude of at least 1,000 feet directly 
over that airport.

Sec. 135.375  Large transport category airplanes: Reciprocating engine 
powered: Landing limitations: Destination airports.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no person 
operating a reciprocating engine powered large transport category 
airplane may take off that airplane, unless its weight on arrival, 
allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil in flight, would allow a 
full stop landing at the intended destination within 60 percent of the 
effective length of each runway described below from a point 50 feet 
directly above the intersection of the obstruction clearance plane and 
the runway. For the purposes of determining the allowable landing weight 
at the destination airport the following is assumed:

[[Page 801]]

    (1) The airplane is landed on the most favorable runway and in the 
most favorable direction in still air.
    (2) The airplane is landed on the most suitable runway considering 
the probable wind velocity and direction (forecast for the expected time 
of arrival), the ground handling characteristics of the type of 
airplane, and other conditions such as landing aids and terrain, and 
allowing for the effect of the landing path and roll of not more than 50 
percent of the headwind component or not less than 150 percent of the 
tailwind component.
    (b) An airplane that would be prohibited from being taken off 
because it could not meet paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be taken 
off if an alternate airport is selected that meets all of this section 
except that the airplane can accomplish a full stop landing within 70 
percent of the effective length of the runway.

plan unless the airplane (at the weight anticipated at the time of 
arrival at the airport), based on the assumptions in Sec. 135.375(a) 
(1) and (2), can be brought to a full stop landing within 70 percent of

Sec. 135.379  Large transport category airplanes: Turbine engine 
powered: Takeoff limitations.

    (a) No person operating a turbine engine powered large transport 
category airplane may take off that airplane at a weight greater than 
that listed in the Airplane Flight Manual for the elevation of the 
airport and for the ambient temperature existing at take- off.
    (b) No person operating a turbine engine powered large transport 
category airplane certificated after August 26, 1957, but before August 
30, 1959 (SR422, 422A), may take off that airplane at a weight greater 
than that listed in the Airplane Flight Manual for the minumum distance 
required for takeoff. In the case of an airplane certificated after 
September 30, 1958 (SR422A, 422B), the takeoff distance may include a 
clearway distance but the clearway distance included may not be greater 
than one-half of the takeoff run.
    (c) No person operating a turbine engine powered large transport 
category airplane certificated after August 29, 1959 (SR422B), may take 
off that airplane at a weight greater than that listed in the Airplane 
Flight Manual at which compliance with the following may be shown:
    (1) The accelerate-stop distance, as defined in Sec. 25.109 of this 
chapter, must not exceed the length of the runway plus the length of any 
stopway.
    (2) The takeoff distance must not exceed the length of the runway 
plus the length of any clearway except that the length of any clearway 
included must not be greater than one-half the length of the runway.
    (3) The takeoff run must not be greater than the length of the 
runway.
    (d) No person operating a turbine engine powered large transport 
category airplane may take off that airplane at a weight greater than 
that listed in the Airplane Flight Manual--
    (1) For an airplane certificated after August 26, 1957, but before 
October 1, 1958 (SR422), that allows a takeoff path that clears all 
obstacles either by at least (35+0.01 D) feet vertically (D is the 
distance along the intended flight path from the end of the runway in 
feet), or by at least 200 feet horizontally within the airport 
boundaries and by at least 300 feet horizontally after passing the 
boundaries; or
    (2) For an airplane certificated after September 30, 1958 (SR422A, 
422B), that allows a net takeoff flight path that clears all obstacles 
either by a height of at least 35 feet vertically, or by at least 200 
feet horizontally within the airport boundaries and by at least 300 feet 
horizontally after passing the boundaries.
    (e) In determining maximum weights, minimum distances, and flight 
paths under paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, correction must 
be made for the runway to be used, the elevation of the airport, the 
effective runway gradient, the ambient temperature and wind component at 
the time of takeoff, and, if operating limitations exist for the minimum 
distances required for takeoff from wet runways,

[[Page 802]]

the runway surface condition (dry or wet). Wet runway distances 
associated with grooved or porous friction course runways, if provided 
in the Airplane Flight Manual, may be used only for runways that are 
grooved or treated with a porous friction course (PFC) overlay, and that 
the operator determines are designed, constructed, and maintained in a 
manner acceptable to the Administrator.
    (f) For the purposes of this section, it is assumed that the 
airplane is not banked before reaching a height of 50 feet, as shown by 
the takeoff path or net takeoff flight path data (as appropriate) in the 
Airplane Flight Manual, and after that the maximum bank is not more than 
15 degrees.
    (g) For the purposes of this section, the terms, takeoff distance, 
takeoff run, net takeoff flight path, have the same meanings as set 
forth in the rules under which the airplane was certificated.

Sec. 135.381  Large transport category airplanes: Turbine engine 
powered: En route limitations: One engine inoperative.

    (a) No person operating a turbine engine powered large transport 
category airplane may take off that airplane at a weight, allowing for 
normal consumption of fuel and oil, that is greater than that which 
(under the approved, one engine inoperative, en route net flight path 
data in the Airplane Flight Manual for that airplane) will allow 
compliance with paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section, based on the 
ambient temperatures expected en route.
    (1) There is a positive slope at an altitude of at least 1,000 feet 
above all terrain and obstructions within five statute miles on each 
side of the intended track, and, in addition, if that airplane was 
certificated after August 29, 1958 (SR422B), there is a positive slope 
at 1,500 feet above the airport where the airplane is assumed to land 
after an engine fails.
    (2) The net flight path allows the airplane to continue flight from 
the cruising altitude to an airport where a landing can be made under 
Sec. 135.387 clearing all terrain and obstructions within five statute 
miles of the intended track by at least 2,000 feet vertically and with a 
positive slope at 1,000 feet above the airport where the airplane lands 
after an engine fails, or, if that airplane was certificated after 
September 30, 1958 (SR422A, 422B), with a positive slope at 1,500 feet 
above the airport where the airplane lands after an engine fails.
    (b) For the purpose of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it is 
assumed that--
    (1) The engine fails at the most critical point en route;
    (2) The airplane passes over the critical obstruction, after engine 
failure at a point that is no closer to the obstruction than the 
approved radio navigation fix, unless the Administrator authorizes a 
different procedure based on adequate operational safeguards;
    (3) An approved method is used to allow for adverse winds;
    (4) Fuel jettisoning will be allowed if the certificate holder shows 
that the crew is properly instructed, that the training program is 
adequate, and that all other precautions are taken to ensure a safe 
procedure;
    (5) The alternate airport is selected and meets the prescribed 
weather minimums; and
    (6) The consumption of fuel and oil after engine failure is the same 
as the consumption that is allowed for in the approved net flight path 
data in the Airplane Flight Manual.


<R05>
Sec. 135.383  Large transport category airplanes: Turbine engine 
powered: En route limitations: Two engines inoperative.

    (a) Airplanes certificated after August 26, 1957, but before October 
1, 1958 (SR422). No person may operate a turbine engine powered large 
transport category airplane along an intended route unless that person 
complies with either of the following:
    (1) There is no place along the intended track that is more than 90 
minutes (with all engines operating at cruising power) from an airport 
that meets Sec. 135.387.
    (2) Its weight, according to the two-engine-inoperative, en route, 
net flight path data in the Airplane Flight Manual, allows the airplane 
to fly from the

[[Page 803]]

point where the two engines are assumed to fail simultaneously to an 
airport that meets Sec. 135.387, with a net flight path (considering 
the ambient temperature anticipated along the track) having a positive 
slope at an altitude of at least 1,000 feet above all terrain and 
obstructions within five statute miles on each side of the intended 
track, or at an altitude of 5,000 feet, whichever is higher.

For the purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it is assumed that 
the two engines fail at the most critical point en route, that if fuel 
jettisoning is provided, the airplane's weight at the point where the 
engines fail includes enough fuel to continue to the airport and to 
arrive at an altitude of at least 1,000 feet directly over the airport, 
and that the fuel and oil consumption after engine failure is the same 
as the consumption allowed for in the net flight path data in the 
Airplane Flight Manual.
    (b) Airplanes certificated after September 30, 1958, but before 
August 30, 1959 (SR422A). No person may operate a turbine engine powered 
large transport category airplane along an intended route unless that

path (considering the ambient temperatures anticipated along the track) 
having a positive slope at an altitude of at least 1,000 feet above all 
terrain and obstructions within five statute miles on each side of the 
intended track, or at an altitude of 2,000 feet, whichever is higher.

For the purpose of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, it is assumed that 
the two engines fail at the most critical point en route, that the 
airplane's weight at the point where the engines fail includes enough 
fuel to continue to the airport, to arrive at an altitude of at least 
1,500 feet directly over the airport, and after that to fly for 15 
minutes at cruise power or thrust, or both, and that the consumption of 
fuel and oil after engine failure is the same as the consumption allowed 
for in the net flight path data in the Airplane Flight Manual.
    (c) Aircraft certificated after August 29, 1959 (SR422B). No person 
may operate a turbine engine powered large transport category airplane 
along an intended route unless that person complies with either of the 
following:
    (1) There is no place along the intended track that is more than 90 
minutes (with all engines operating at cruising power) from an airport 
that meets Sec. 135.387.
    (2) Its weight, according to the two-engine-inoperative, en route, 
net flight path data in the Airplane Flight Manual, allows the airplane 
to fly from the point where the two engines are assumed to fail 
simultaneously to an airport that meets Sec. 135.387, with the net 
flight path (considering the ambient temperatures anticipated along the 
track) clearing vertically by at least 2,000 feet all terrain and 
obstructions within five statute miles on each side of the intended 
track. For the purposes of this paragraph, it is assumed that--
    (i) The two engines fail at the most critical point en route;
    (ii) The net flight path has a positive slope at 1,500 feet above 
the airport where the landing is assumed to be made after the engines 
fail;
    (iii) Fuel jettisoning will be approved if the certificate holder 
shows that the crew is properly instructed, that the training program is 
adequate, and that all other precautions are taken to ensure a safe 
procedure;
    (iv) The airplane's weight at the point where the two engines are 
assumed to fail provides enough fuel to continue to the airport, to 
arrive at an altitude of at least 1,500 feet directly over the airport, 
and after that to fly for 15 minutes at cruise power or thrust, or both; 
and
    (v) The consumption of fuel and oil after the engines fail is the 
same as the consumption that is allowed for in the net flight path data 
in the Airplane Flight Manual.

Sec. 135.385  Large transport category airplanes: Turbine engine 
powered: Landing limitations: Destination airports.

    (a) No person operating a turbine engine powered large transport 
category airplane may take off that airplane at a weight that (allowing 
for normal consumption of fuel and oil in flight to the destination or 
alternate airport) the weight of the airplane on arrival would exceed 
the landing weight in the Airplane Flight Manual for the elevation of 
the destination or alternate airport and the ambient temperature 
anticipated at the time of landing.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c), (d), (e), or (f) of this 
section, no person operating a turbine engine powered large transport 
category airplane may take off that airplane unless its weight on 
arrival, allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil in flight (in 
accordance with the landing distance in the Airplane Flight Manual for 
the elevation of the destination airport and the wind conditions 
expected there at the time of landing), would allow a full stop landing 
at the intended destination airport within 60 percent of the effective 
length of each runway described below from a point 50 feet above the 
intersection of the obstruction clearance plane and the runway. For the 
purpose of determining the allowable landing weight at the destination 
airport the following is assumed:
    (1) The airplane is landed on the most favorable runway and in the 
most favorable direction, in still air.
    (2) The airplane is landed on the most suitable runway considering 
the probable wind velocity and direction and the ground handling 
characteristics of the airplane, and considering other conditions such 
as landing aids and terrain.
    (c) A turbopropeller powered airplane that would be prohibited from 
being taken off because it could not meet paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, may be taken off if an alternate airport is selected that meets 
all of this section except that the airplane can accomplish a full stop 
landing within 70 percent of the effective length of the runway.
    (d) Unless, based on a showing of actual operating landing 
techniques on wet runways, a shorter landing distance (but never less 
than that required by paragraph (b) of this section) has been approved 
for a specific type and model airplane and included in the Airplane 
Flight Manual, no person may take off a turbojet airplane when the 
appropriate weather reports or forecasts, or any combination of them, 
indicate that the runways at the destination airport may be wet or 
slippery at the estimated time of arrival unless the effective runway 
length at the destination airport is at least 115 percent of the runway 
length required under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (e) A turbojet airplane that would be prohibited from being taken 
off because it could not meet paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be 
taken off if an alternate airport is selected that meets all of 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (f) An eligible on-demand operator may take off a turbine engine 
powered large transport category airplane on an on-demand flight if all 
of the following conditions exist:
    (1) The operation is permitted by an approved Destination Airport 
Analysis in that person's operations manual.
    (2) The airplane's weight on arrival, allowing for normal 
consumption of fuel and oil in flight (in accordance with the landing 
distance in the Airplane Flight Manual for the elevation of the 
destination airport and the wind conditions expected there at the time 
of landing), would allow a full stop landing at the intended destination 
airport within 80 percent of the effective length of each runway 
described below from a point 50 feet above the intersection of the 
obstruction clearance plane and the runway. For the purpose of 
determining the allowable landing weight at the destination airport, the 
following is assumed:
    (i) The airplane is landed on the most favorable runway and in the 
most favorable direction, in still air.
    (ii) The airplane is landed on the most suitable runway considering 
the probable wind velocity and direction and the ground handling 
characteristics of the airplane, and considering other conditions such 
as landing aids and terrain.

powered: Landing limitations: Alternate airports.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no person 
may select an airport as an alternate airport for a turbine engine 
powered large transport category airplane unless (based on the 
assumptions in Sec. 135.385(b)) that airplane, at the weight expected 
at the time of arrival, can be brought to a full stop landing within 70 
percent of the effective length of the runway for turbo-propeller-
powered airplanes and 60 percent of the effective length of the runway 
for turbojet airplanes, from a point 50 feet above the intersection of 
the obstruction clearance plane and the runway.
    (b) Eligible on-demand operators may select an airport as an 
alternate airport for a turbine engine powered large transport category 
airplane if (based on the assumptions in Sec. 135.385(f)) that 
airplane, at the weight expected at the time of arrival, can be brought 
to a full stop landing within 80 percent of the effective length of the 
runway from a point 50 feet above the intersection of the obstruction

Sec. 135.389  Large nontransport category airplanes: Takeoff limitations.

    (a) No person operating a large nontransport category airplane may 
take off that airplane at a weight greater than the weight that would 
allow the airplane to be brought to a safe stop within the effective 
length of the runway, from any point during the takeoff before reaching 
105 percent of minimum control speed (the minimum speed at which an 
airplane can be safely controlled in flight after an engine becomes 
inoperative) or 115 percent of the power off stalling speed in the 
takeoff configuration, whichever is greater.
    (b) For the purposes of this section--
    (1) It may be assumed that takeoff power is used on all engines 
during the acceleration;
    (2) Not more than 50 percent of the reported headwind component, or 
not less than 150 percent of the reported tailwind component, may be 
taken into account;
    (3) The average runway gradient (the difference between the 
elevations of the endpoints of the runway divided by the total length) 
must be considered if it is more than one-half of one percent;
    (4) It is assumed that the airplane is operating in standard 
atmosphere; and
    (5) For takeoff, effective length of the runway means the distance 
from the end of the runway at which the takeoff is started to a point at 
which the obstruction clearance plane associated with the other end of 
the runway intersects the runway centerline.

Sec. 135.391  Large nontransport category airplanes: En route 
limitations: One engine inoperative.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no person 
operating a large nontransport category airplane may take off that 
airplane at a weight that does not allow a rate of climb of at least 50 
feet a minute, with the critical engine inoperative, at an altitude of 
at least 1,000 feet above the highest obstruction within five miles on 
each side of the intended track, or 5,000 feet, whichever is higher.
    (b) Without regard to paragraph (a) of this section, if the 
Administrator finds that safe operations are not impaired, a person may 
operate the airplane at an altitude that allows the airplane, in case of 
engine failure, to clear all obstructions within five miles on each side 
of the intended track by 1,000 feet. If this procedure is used, the rate 
of descent for the appropriate weight and altitude is assumed to be 50 
feet a minute greater than the rate in the approved performance data. 
Before approving such a procedure, the Administrator considers the 
following for the route, route segement, or area concerned:
    (1) The reliability of wind and weather forecasting.
    (2) The location and kinds of navigation aids.

[[Page 806]]

    (3) The prevailing weather conditions, particularly the frequency 
and amount of turbulence normally encountered.
    (4) Terrain features.
    (5) Air traffic problems.
    (6) Any other operational factors that affect the operations.
    (c) For the purposes of this section, it is assumed that--
    (1) The critical engine is inoperative;
    (2) The propeller of the inoperative engine is in the minimum drag 
position;
    (3) The wing flaps and landing gear are in the most favorable 
position;
    (4) The operating engines are operating at the maximum continuous 
power available;
    (5) The airplane is operating in standard atmosphere; and
    (6) The weight of the airplane is progressively reduced by the 
anticipated consumption of fuel and oil.

than the weight that would allow a full stop landing within 60 percent 
of the effective length of the most suitable runway at the destination 
airport; and
    (2) Is greater than the weight allowable if the landing is to be 
made on the runway--
    (i) With the greatest effective length in still air; and
    (ii) Required by the probable wind, taking into account not more 
than 50 percent of the headwind component or not less than 150 percent 
of the tailwind component.
    (b) For the purpose of this section, it is assumed that--
    (1) The airplane passes directly over the intersection of the 
obstruction clearance plane and the runway at a height of 50 feet in a 
steady gliding approach at a true indicated airspeed of at least 1.3 
V<INF>so</INF>;

  Appendix A to Part 135--Additional Airworthiness Standards for 10 or 
                        More Passenger Airplanes

                              Applicability

    1. Applicability. This appendix prescribes the additional 
airworthiness standards required by Sec. 135.169.
    2. References. Unless otherwise provided, references in this 
appendix to specific sections of part 23 of the Federal Aviation 
Regulations (FAR part 23) are to those sections of part 23 in effect on 
March 30, 1967.

                           Flight Requirements

    3. General. Compliance must be shown with the applicable 
requirements of subpart B of FAR part 23, as supplemented or modified in 
Sec. Sec. 4 through 10.

                               Performance

    4. General. (a) Unless otherwise prescribed in this appendix, 
compliance with each applicable performance requirement in sections 4 
through 7 must be shown for ambient atmospheric conditions and still 
air.
    (b) The performance must correspond to the propulsive thrust 
available under the particular ambient atmospheric conditions and the 
particular flight condition. The available propulsive thrust must 
correspond to engine power or thrust, not exceeding the approved power 
or thrust less--
    (1) Installation losses; and
    (2) The power or equivalent thrust absorbed by the accessories and 
services appropriate to the particular ambient atmospheric conditions 
and the particular flight condition.
    (c) Unless otherwise prescribed in this appendix, the applicant must 
select the take-off, en route, and landing configurations for the 
airplane.
    (d) The airplane configuration may vary with weight, altitude, and 
temperature, to the extent they are compatible with the operating 
procedures required by paragraph (e) of this section.
    (e) Unless otherwise prescribed in this appendix, in determining the 
critical engine inoperative takeoff performance, the accelerate-stop 
distance, takeoff distance, changes in the airplane's configuration, 
speed, power, and thrust must be made under procedures established by 
the applicant for operation in service.
    (f) Procedures for the execution of balked landings must be 
established by the applicant and included in the Airplane Flight Manual.
    (g) The procedures established under paragraphs (e) and (f) of this 
section must--
    (1) Be able to be consistently executed in service by a crew of 
average skill;
    (2) Use methods or devices that are safe and reliable; and

[[Page 820]]

    (3) Include allowance for any time delays, in the execution of the 
procedures, that may reasonably be expected in service.
    5. Takeoff--(a) General. Takeoff speeds, the accelerate-stop 
distance, the takeoff distance, and the one-engine-inoperative takeoff 
flight path data (described in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (f) of this 
section), must be determined for--
    (1) Each weight, altitude, and ambient temperature within the 
operational limits selected by the applicant;
    (2) The selected configuration for takeoff;
    (3) The center of gravity in the most unfavorable position;
    (4) The operating engine within approved operating limitations; and
    (5) Takeoff data based on smooth, dry, hard-surface runway.
    (b) Takeoff speeds. (1) The decision speed V<INF>1</INF> is the 
calibrated airspeed on the ground at which, as a result of engine 
failure or other reasons, the pilot is assumed to have made a decision 
to continue or discontinue the takeoff. The speed V<INF>1</INF> must be 
selected by the applicant but may not be less than--
    (i) 1.10VS<INF>1</INF>;
    (ii) 1.10VMC;
    (iii) A speed that allows acceleration to V<INF>1</INF> and stop 
under paragraph (c) of this section; or
    (iv) A speed at which the airplane can be rotated for takeoff and 
shown to be adequate to safely continue the takeoff, using normal 
piloting skill, when the critical engine is suddenly made inoperative.
    (2) The initial climb out speed V<INF>2</INF>, in terms of 
calibrated airspeed, must be selected by the applicant so as to allow 
the gradient of climb required in section 6(b)(2), but it must not be 
less than V<INF>1</INF> or less than 1.2VS<INF>1</INF>.
    (3) Other essential take off speeds necessary for safe operation of 
the airplane.
    (c) Accelerate-stop distance. (1) The accelerate-stop distance is 
the sum of the distances necessary to--
    (i) Accelerate the airplane from a standing start to V<INF>1</INF>; 
and
    (ii) Come to a full stop from the point at which V<INF>1</INF> is 
reached assuming that in the case of engine failure, failure of the 
critical engine is recognized by the pilot at the speed V<INF>1</INF>.
    (2) Means other than wheel brakes may be used to determine the 
accelerate-stop distance if that means is available with the critical 
engine inoperative and--
    (i) Is safe and reliable;
    (ii) Is used so that consistent results can be expected under normal 
operating conditions; and
    (iii) Is such that exceptional skill is not required to control the 
airplane.
    (d) All engines operating takeoff distance. The all engine operating 
takeoff distance is the horizontal distance required to takeoff and 
climb to a height of 50 feet above the takeoff surface under the 
procedures in FAR 23.51(a).
    (e) One-engine-inoperative takeoff. Determine the weight for each 
altitude and temperature within the operational limits established for 
the airplane, at which the airplane has the capability, after failure of 
the critical engine at V<INF>1</INF> determined under paragraph (b) of 
this section, to take off and climb at not less than V<INF>2</INF>, to a 
height 1,000 feet above the takeoff surface and attain the speed and 
configuration at which compliance is shown with the en route one-engine-
inoperative gradient of climb specified in section 6(c).
    (f) One-engine-inoperative takeoff flight path data. The one-engine-
inoperative takeoff flight path data consist of takeoff flight paths 
extending from a standing start to a point in the takeoff at which the 
airplane reaches a height 1,000 feet above the takeoff surface under 
paragraph (e) of this section.
    6. Climb--(a) Landing climb: All-engines-operating. The maximum 
weight must be determined with the airplane in the landing 
configuration, for each altitude, and ambient temperature within the 
operational limits established for the airplane, with the most 
unfavorable center of gravity, and out-of-ground effect in free air, at 
which the steady gradient of climb will not be less than 3.3 percent, 
with:
    (1) The engines at the power that is available 8 seconds after 
initiation of movement of the power or thrust controls from the minimum 
flight idle to the takeoff position.
    (2) A climb speed not greater than the approach speed established 
under section 7 and not less than the greater of 1.05VMC or 
1.10VS<INF>1</INF>.
    (b) Takeoff climb: one-engine-inoperative. The maximum weight at 
which the airplane meets the minimum climb performance specified in 
paragraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph must be determined for each 
altitude and ambient temperature within the operational limits 
established for the airplane, out of ground effect in free air, with the 
airplane in the takeoff configuration, with the most unfavorable center 
of gravity, the critical engine inoperative, the remaining engines at 
the maximum takeoff power or thrust, and the propeller of the 
inoperative engine windmilling with the propeller controls in the normal 
position except that, if an approved automatic feathering system is 
installed, the propellers may be in the feathered position:
    (1) Takeoff: landing gear extended. The minimum steady gradient of 
climb must be measurably positive at the speed V<INF>1</INF>.
    (2) Takeoff: landing gear retracted. The minimum steady gradient of 
climb may not be less than 2 percent at speed V<INF>2</INF>. For 
airplanes with fixed landing gear this requirement must be met with the 
landing gear extended.

[[Page 821]]

    (c) En route climb: one-engine-inoperative. The maximum weight must 
be determined for each altitude and ambient temperature within the 
operational limits established for the airplane, at which the steady 
gradient of climb is not less 1.2 percent at an altitude 1,000 feet 
above the takeoff surface, with the airplane in the en route 
configuration, the critical engine inoperative, the remaining engine at 
the maximum continuous power or thrust, and the most unfavorable center 
of gravity.
    7. Landing. (a) The landing field length described in paragraph (b) 
of this section must be determined for standard atmosphere at each 
weight and altitude within the operational limits established by the 
applicant.
    (b) The landing field length is equal to the landing distance 
determined under FAR 23.75(a) divided by a factor of 0.6 for the 
destination airport and 0.7 for the alternate airport. Instead of the 
gliding approach specified in FAR 23.75(a)(1), the landing may be 
preceded by a steady approach down to the 50-foot height at a gradient 
of descent not greater than 5.2 percent (3[deg]) at a calibrated 
airspeed not less than 1.3VS<INF>1</INF>.

                                  Trim

    8--Trim (a) Lateral and directional trim. The airplane must maintain 
lateral and directional trim in level flight at a speed of VH or VMO/
MMO, whichever is lower, with landing gear and wing flaps retracted.
    (b) Longitudinal trim. The airplane must maintain longitudinal trim 
during the following conditions, except that it need not maintain trim 
at a speed greater than VMO/MMO:
    (1) In the approach conditons specified in FAR 23.161(c) (3) through 
(5), except that instead of the speeds specified in those paragraphs, 
trim must be maintained with a stick force of not more than 10 pounds 
down to a speed used in showing compliance with section 7 or 
1.4VS<INF>1</INF> whichever is lower.
    (2) In level flight at any speed from VH or VMO/MMO, whichever is 
lower, to either Vx or 1.4VS<INF>1</INF>, with the landing gear and wing 
flaps retracted.

23.175(b) and with paragraph (b) of this section, the airspeed must 
return to within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>7\1/2\ percent of the trim speed.
    (b) Cruise stability. The stick force curve must have a stable slope 
for a speed range of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>50 knots from the trim speed

outer extremes of the friction band and the stick force may not exceed 
50 pounds with--
    (1) Landing gear retracted;
    (2) Wing flaps retracted;
    (3) The maximum cruising power as selected by the applicant as an 
operating limitation for turbine engines or 75 percent of maximum

factor, MFC need not exceed the Mach number at which effective speed 
warning occurs.
    (c) Climb stability (turbopropeller powered airplanes only). In 
showing compliance with FAR 23.175(a), an applicant must, instead of the 
power specified in FAR 23.175(a)(4), use the maximum power or thrust 
selected by the applicant as an operating limitation for use during 
climb at the best rate of climb speed, except that the speed need not be 
less than 1.4VS<INF>1</INF>.

                                 Stalls

    10. Stall warning. If artificial stall warning is required to comply 
with FAR 23.207, the warning device must give clearly distinguishable 
indications under expected conditions of flight. The use of a visual 
warning device that requires the attention of the crew within the 
cockpit is not acceptable by itself.

    11. Electric trim tabs. The airplane must meet FAR 23.677 and in 
addition it must be shown that the airplane is safely controllable and 
that a pilot can perform all the maneuvers and operations necessary to 
effect a safe landing following any probable electric trim tab runaway 
which might be reasonably expected in service allowing for appropriate 
time delay after pilot recognition of the runaway. This demonstration 
must be conducted at the critical airplane weights and center of gravity 
positions.

                        Instruments: Installation

standard atmosphere with a minimum practicable instrument calibration 
error when the corresponding pitot and static pressures are supplied to 
the instruments.
    (b) The airspeed indicating system must be calibrated to determine 
the system error, i.e., the relation between IAS and CAS, in flight and 
during the accelerate-takeoff ground run. The ground run calibration 
must be obtained between 0.8 of the minimum value of V1 and 1.2 times 
the maximum value of V1, considering the approved ranges of altitude and 
weight. The ground run calibration is determined assuming an engine 
failure at the minimum value of V1.
    (c) The airspeed error of the installation excluding the instrument 
calibration error, must not exceed 3 percent or 5 knots whichever is 
greater, throughout the speed range from VMO to 1.3VS<INF>1</INF> with 
flaps retracted and from 1.3VSO to VFE with flaps in the landing 
position.
    (d) Information showing the relationship between IAS and CAS must be 
shown in the Airplane Flight manual.
    14. Static air vent system. The static air vent system must meet FAR 
23.1325. The altimeter system calibration must be determined and shown 
in the Airplane Flight Manual.

                  Operating Limitations and Information

    15. Maximum operating limit speed VMO/MMO. Instead of establishing 
operating limitations based on VNE and VNO, the applicant must establish 
a maximum operating limit speed VMO/MMO as follows:
    (a) The maximum operating limit speed must not exceed the design 
cruising speed VC and must be sufficiently below VD/MD or VDF/MDF to 
make it highly improbable that the latter speeds will be inadvertently 
exceeded in flight.
    (b) The speed VMO must not exceed 0.8VD/MD or 0.8VDF/MDF unless 
flight demonstrations involving upsets as specified by the Administrator 
indicates a lower speed margin will not result in speeds exceeding VD/MD 
or VDF. Atmospheric variations, horizontal gusts, system and equipment 
errors, and airframe production variations are taken into account.
    16. Minimum flight crew. In addition to meeting FAR 23.1523, the 
applicant must establish the minimum number and type of qualified flight 
crew personnel sufficient for safe operation of the airplane 
considering--
    (a) Each kind of operation for which the applicant desires approval;
    (b) The workload on each crewmember considering the following:
    (1) Flight path control.

except that, the airspeed notations and markings in terms of VNO and VNH 
must be replaced by the VMO/MMO notations. The airspeed indicator 
markings must be easily read and understood by the pilot. A placard 
adjacent to the airspeed indicator is an acceptable means of showing 
compliance with FAR 23.1545(c).

and VNE.
    (b) Takeoff weight limitations. The maximum takeoff weight for each 
airport elevation, ambient temperature, and available takeoff runway 
length within the range selected by the applicant may not exceed the 
weight at which--

[[Page 823]]

    (1) The all-engine-operating takeoff distance determined under 
section 5(b) or the accelerate-stop distance determined under section 
5(c), whichever is greater, is equal to the available runway length;
    (2) The airplane complies with the one-engine-inoperative takeoff 
requirements specified in section 5(e); and

and en route climb requirements specified in sections 6 (b) and (c).
    (c) Landing weight limitations. The maximum landing weight for each 
airport elevation (standard temperature) and available landing runway 
length, within the range selected by the applicant. This weight may not 
exceed the weight at which the landing field length determined under 
section 7(b) is equal to the available runway length. In showing 
compliance with this operating limitation, it is acceptable to assume 
that the landing weight at the destination will be equal to the takeoff 
weight reduced by the normal consumption of fuel and oil en route.

    24. Engine torque. (a) Each turbopropeller engine mount and its 
supporting structure must be designed for the torque effects of:
    (1) The conditions in FAR 23.361(a).
    (2) The limit engine torque corresponding to takeoff power and 
propeller speed multiplied by a factor accounting for propeller control 
system malfunction, including quick feathering action, simultaneously 
with 1g level flight loads. In the absence of a ration- al analysis, a 
factor of 1.6 must be used.
    (b) The limit torque is obtained by multiplying the mean torque by a 
factor of 1.25.
    25. Turbine engine gyroscopic loads. Each turbopropeller engine 
mount and its supporting structure must be designed for the gyroscopic 
loads that result, with the engines at maximum continuous r.p.m., under 
either--
    (a) The conditions in FARs 23.351 and 23.423; or
    (b) All possible combinations of the following:
    (1) A yaw velocity of 2.5 radians per second.
    (2) A pitch velocity of 1.0 radians per second.
    (3) A normal load factor of 2.5.
    (4) Maximum continuous thrust.
    26. Unsymmetrical loads due to engine failure. (a) Turbopropeller 
powered airplanes must be designed for the unsymmet- rical loads 
resulting from the failure of the critical engine including the 
following conditions in combination with a single malfunction of the 
propeller drag limiting system, considering the probable pilot 
corrective action on the flight controls:
    (1) At speeds between Vmo and VD, the loads resulting from power 
failure because of fuel flow interruption are considered to be limit 
loads.
    (2) At speeds between Vmo and Vc, the loads resulting from the 
disconnection of the engine compressor from the turbine or from loss of 
the turbine blades are considered to be ultimate loads.
    (3) The time history of the thrust decay and drag buildup occurring 
as a result of the prescribed engine failures must be substantiated by 
test or other data applicable to the particular engine-propeller 
combination.
    (4) The timing and magnitude of the probable pilot corrective action 
must be conserv- atively estimated, considering the characteristics of 
the particular engine-propeller-airplane combination.
    (b) Pilot corrective action may be assumed to be initiated at the 
time maximum yawing velocity is reached, but not earlier than 2

[[Page 824]]

seconds after the engine failure. The magnitude of the corrective action 
may be based on the control forces in FAR 23.397 except that lower 
forces may be assumed where it is shown by analysis or test that these 
forces can control the yaw and roll resulting from the prescribed engine 
failure conditions.

                              Ground Loads

    27. Dual wheel landing gear units. Each dual wheel landing gear unit 
and its supporting structure must be shown to comply with the following:
    (a) Pivoting. The airplane must be assumed to pivot about one side 
of the main gear with the brakes on that side locked. The limit vertical 
load factor must be 1.0 and the coefficient of friction 0.8. This 
condition need apply only to the main gear and its supporting structure.
    (b) Unequal tire inflation. A 60-40 percent distribution of the 
loads established under FAR 23.471 through FAR 23.483 must be applied to 
the dual wheels.
    (c) Flat tire. (1) Sixty percent of the loads in FAR 23.471 through 
FAR 23.483 must be applied to either wheel in a unit.
    (2) Sixty percent of the limit drag and side loads and 100 percent 
of the limit vertical load established under FARs 23.493 and 23.485 must 
be applied to either wheel in a unit except that the vertical load need 
not exceed the maximum vertical load in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section.

                           Fatigue Evaluation

    28. Fatigue evaluation of wing and associated structure. Unless it 
is shown that the structure, operating stress levels, materials and 
expected use are comparable from a fatigue standpoint to a similar 
design which has had substantial satisfactory service experience, the 
strength, detail design, and the fabrication of those parts of the wing, 
wing carrythrough, and attaching structure whose failure would be 
catastrophic must be evaluated under either--
    (a) A fatigue strength investigation in which the structure is shown 
by analysis, tests, or both to be able to withstand the repeated loads 
of variable magnitude expected in service; or
    (b) A fail-safe strength investigation in which it is shown by 
analysis, tests, or both that catastrophic failure of the structure is 
not probable after fatigue, or obvious partial failure, of a principal 
structural element, and that the remaining structure is able to 
withstand a static ultimate load factor of 75 percent of the critical 
limit load factor at VC. These loads must be multiplied by a factor of 
1.15 unless the dynamic effects of failure under static load are 
otherwise considered.

                         Design and Construction

    29. Flutter. For multiengine turbopropeller powered airplanes, a 
dynamic evaluation must be made and must include--
    (a) The significant elastic, inertia, and aerodynamic forces 
associated with the rotations and displacements of the plane of the 
propeller; and
    (b) Engine-propeller-nacelle stiffness and damping variations 
appropriate to the particular configuration.

                              Landing Gear

    30. Flap operated landing gear warning device. Airplanes having 
retractable landing gear and wing flaps must be equipped with a warning 
device that functions continuously when the wing flaps are extended to a 
flap position that activates the warning device to give adequate warning 
before landing, using normal landing procedures, if the landing gear is 
not fully extended and locked. There may not be a manual shut off for 
this warning device. The flap position sensing unit may be installed at 
any suitable location. The system for this device may use any part of 
the system (including the aural warning device) provided for other 
landing gear warning devices.

                   Personnel and Cargo Accommodations

    31. Cargo and baggage compartments. Cargo and baggage compartments 
must be designed to meet FAR 23.787 (a) and (b), and in addition means 
must be provided to protect passengers from injury by the contents of 
any cargo or baggage compartment when the ultimate forward inertia force

as a result of mechanical failure. Each external door must be operable 
from both the inside and the outside.
    (b) There must be means for direct visual inspection of the locking 
mechanism by crewmembers to determine whether external doors and exits, 
for which the initial opening movement is outward, are fully locked. In

normally used external doors are closed and fully locked.
    (c) The passenger entrance door must qualify as a floor level 
emergency exit. Each additional required emergency exit except floor 
level exits must be located over the wing or must be provided with 
acceptable means to assist the occupants in descending to the ground. In 
addition to the passenger entrance door:
    (1) For a total seating capacity of 15 or less, an emergency exit as 
defined in FAR 23.807(b) is required on each side of the cabin.

[[Page 825]]

    (2) For a total seating capacity of 16 through 23, three emergency 
exits as defined in FAR 23.807(b) are required with one on the same side 
as the door and two on the side opposite the door.
    (d) An evacuation demonstration must be conducted utilizing the 
maximum number of occupants for which certification is desired. It must 
be conducted under simulated night conditions utilizing only the 
emergency exits on the most critical side of the aircraft. The 
participants must be representative of average airline passengers with 
no previous practice or rehearsal for the demonstration. Evacuation must 
be completed within 90 seconds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                              Miscellaneous

    33. Lightning strike protection. Parts that are electrically 
insulated from the basic airframe must be connected to it through 
lightning arrestors unless a lightning strike on the insulated part--
    (a) Is improbable because of shielding by other parts; or
    (b) Is not hazardous.
    34. Ice protection. If certification with ice protection provisions 
is desired, compliance with the following must be shown:
    (a) The recommended procedures for the use of the ice protection 
equipment must be set forth in the Airplane Flight Manual.
    (b) An analysis must be performed to establish, on the basis of the 
airplane's operational needs, the adequacy of the ice protection system 
for the various components of the airplane. In addition, tests of the 
ice protection system must be conducted to demonstrate that the airplane 
is capable of operating safely in continuous maximum and intermittent 
maximum icing conditions as described in appendix C of part 25 of this 
chapter.
    (c) Compliance with all or portions of this section may be 
accomplished by reference, where applicable because of similarity of the 
designs, to analysis and tests performed by the applicant for a type 
certificated model.
    35. Maintenance information. The applicant must make available to 
the owner at the time of delivery of the airplane the information the 
applicant considers essential for the proper maintenance of the 
airplane. That information must include the following:

                               Propulsion

                                 General

    36. Vibration characteristics. For turbopropeller powered airplanes, 
the engine installation must not result in vibration characteristics of 
the engine exceeding those established during the type certification of 
the engine.
    37. In flight restarting of engine. If the engine on turbopropeller 
powered airplanes cannot be restarted at the maximum cruise altitude, a 
determination must be made of the altitude below which restarts can be 
consistently accomplished. Restart information must be provided in the 
Airplane Flight Manual.
    38. Engines. (a) For turbopropeller powered airplanes. The engine 
installation must comply with the following:
    (1) Engine isolation. The powerplants must be arranged and isolated 
from each other to allow operation, in at least one configuration, so 
that the failure or malfunction of any engine, or of any system that can 
affect the engine, will not--
    (i) Prevent the continued safe operation of the remaining engines; 
or
    (ii) Require immediate action by any crewmember for continued safe 
operation.
    (2) Control of engine rotation. There must be a means to 
individually stop and restart the

[[Page 826]]

rotation of any engine in flight except that engine rotation need not be 
stopped if continued rotation could not jeopardize the safety of the 
airplane. Each component of the stopping and restarting system on the 
engine side of the firewall, and that might be exposed to fire, must be 
at least fire resistant. If hydraulic propeller feathering systems are 
used for this purpose, the feathering lines must be at least fire 
resistant under the operating conditions that may be expected to exist 
during feathering.
    (3) Engine speed and gas temperature control devices. The powerplant 
systems associated with engine control devices, systems, and 
instrumentation must provide reasonable assurance that those engine 
operating limitations that adversely affect turbine rotor structural 
integrity will not be exceeded in service.
    (b) For reciprocating engine powered airplanes. To provide engine 
isolation, the powerplants must be arranged and isolated from each other 
to allow operation, in at least one configuration, so that the failure 
or malfunction of any engine, or of any system that can affect that 
engine, will not--
    (1) Prevent the continued safe operation of the remaining engines; 
or
    (2) Require immediate action by any crewmember for continued safe 
operation.
    39. Turbopropeller reversing systems. (a) Turbopropeller reversing 
systems intended for ground operation must be designed so that no single 
failure or malfunction of the system will result in unwanted reverse 
thrust under any expected operating condition. Failure of structural 
elements need not be considered if the probability of this kind of 
failure is extremely remote.
    (b) Turbopropeller reversing systems intended for in flight use must 
be designed so that no unsafe condition will result during normal 
operation of the system, or from any failure (or reasonably likely 
combination of failures) of the reversing system, under any anticipated 
condition of operation of the airplane. Failure of structural elements 
need not be considered if the probability of this kind of failure is 
extremely remote.
    (c) Compliance with this section may be shown by failure analysis, 
testing, or both for propeller systems that allow propeller blades to 
move from the flight low-pitch position to a position that is 
substantially less than that at the normal flight low-pitch stop 
position. The analysis may include or be supported by the analysis made 
to show compliance with the type certification of the propeller and 
associated installation components. Credit will be given for pertinent 
analysis and testing completed by the engine and propeller 
manufacturers.
    40. Turbopropeller drag-limiting systems. Turbopropeller drag-
limiting systems must be designed so that no single failure or 
malfunction of any of the systems during normal or emergency operation 
results in propeller drag in excess of that for which the airplane was 
designed. Failure of structural elements of the drag-limiting systems 
need not be considered if the probability of this kind of failure is 
extremely remote.
    41. Turbine engine powerplant operating characteristics. For 
turbopropeller powered airplanes, the turbine engine powerplant 
operating characteristics must be investigated in flight to determine 
that no adverse characteristics (such as stall, surge, or flameout) are 
present to a hazardous degree, during normal and emergency operation 
within the range of operating limitations of the airplane and of the 
engine.
    42. Fuel flow. (a) For turbopropeller powered airplanes--
    (1) The fuel system must provide for continuous supply of fuel to 
the engines for normal operation without interruption due to depletion 
of fuel in any tank other than the main tank; and
    (2) The fuel flow rate for turbopropeller engine fuel pump systems 
must not be less than 125 percent of the fuel flow required to develop 
the standard sea level atmospheric conditions takeoff power selected and 
included as an operating limitation in the Airplane Flight Manual.
    (b) For reciprocating engine powered airplanes, it is acceptable for 
the fuel flow rate for each pump system (main and reserve supply) to be 
125 percent of the takeoff fuel consumption of the engine.

                         Fuel System Components

    43. Fuel pumps. For turbopropeller powered airplanes, a reliable and 
independent power source must be provided for each pump used with 
turbine engines which do not have provisions for mechanically driving 
the main pumps. It must be demonstrated that the pump installations 
provide a reliability and durability equivalent to that in FAR 
23.991(a).
    44. Fuel strainer or filter. For turbopropeller powered airplanes, 
the following apply:
    (a) There must be a fuel strainer or filter between the tank outlet 
and the fuel metering device of the engine. In addition, the fuel 
strainer or filter must be--
    (1) Between the tank outlet and the engine-driven positive 
displacement pump inlet, if there is an engine-driven positive 
displacement pump;
    (2) Accessible for drainage and cleaning and, for the strainer 
screen, easily removable; and
    (3) Mounted so that its weight is not supported by the connecting 
lines or by the inlet or outlet connections of the strainer or filter 
itself.
    (b) Unless there are means in the fuel system to prevent the 
accumulation of ice on

[[Page 827]]

the filter, there must be means to automatically maintain the fuel-flow 
if ice-clogging of the filter occurs; and
    (c) The fuel strainer or filter must be of adequate capacity (for 
operating limitations established to ensure proper service) and of 
appropriate mesh to insure proper engine operation, with the fuel 
contaminated to a degree (for particle size and density) that can be 
reasonably expected in service. The degree of fuel filtering may not be 
less than that established for the engine type certification.
    45. Lightning strike protection. Protection must be provided against 
the ignition of flammable vapors in the fuel vent system due to 
lightning strikes.

                                 Cooling

    46. Cooling test procedures for turbopropeller powered airplanes. 
(a) Turbopropeller powered airplanes must be shown to comply with FAR 
23.1041 during takeoff, climb, en route, and landing stages of flight 
that correspond to the applicable performance requirements. The cooling 
tests must be conducted with the airplane in the configuration, and 
operating under the conditions that are critical relative to cooling 
during each stage of flight. For the cooling tests a temperature is 
``stabilized'' when its rate of change is less than 2[deg] F. per 
minute.
    (b) Temperatures must be stabilized under the conditions from which 
entry is made into each stage of flight being investigated unless the 
entry condition is not one during which component and engine fluid 
temperatures would stabilize, in which case, operation through the full 
entry condition must be conducted before entry into the stage of flight 
being investigated to allow temperatures to reach their natural levels 
at the time of entry. The takeoff cooling test must be preceded by a 
period during which the powerplant component and engine fluid 
temperatures are stabilized with the engines at ground idle.
    (c) Cooling tests for each stage of flight must be continued until--
    (1) The component and engine fluid temperatures stabilize;
    (2) The stage of flight is completed; or
    (3) An operating limitation is reached.

                            Induction System

    47. Air induction. For turbopropeller powered airplanes--
    (a) There must be means to prevent hazardous quantities of fuel 
leakage or overflow from drains, vents, or other components of flammable 
fluid systems from entering the engine intake systems; and
    (b) The air inlet ducts must be located or protected so as to 
minimize the ingestion of foreign matter during takeoff, landing, and 
taxiing.
    48. Induction system icing protection. For turbopropeller powered 
airplanes, each turbine engine must be able to operate throughout its 
flight power range without adverse effect on engine operation or serious 
loss of power or thrust, under the icing conditions specified in 
appendix C of part 25 of this chapter. In addition, there must be means 
to indicate to appropriate flight crewmembers the functioning of the 
powerplant ice protection system.
    49. Turbine engine bleed air systems. Turbine engine bleed air 
systems of turbopropeller powered airplanes must be investigated to 
determine--
    (a) That no hazard to the airplane will result if a duct rupture 
occurs. This condition must consider that a failure of the duct can 
occur anywhere between the engine port and the airplane bleed service; 
and
    (b) That, if the bleed air system is used for direct cabin 
pressurization, it is not possible for hazardous contamination of the 
cabin air system to occur in event of lubrication system failure.

                             Exhaust System

    50. Exhaust system drains. Turbopropeller engine exhaust systems 
having low spots or pockets must incorporate drains at those locations. 
These drains must discharge clear of the airplane in normal and ground 
attitudes to prevent the accumulation of fuel after the failure of an 
attempted engine start.

                   Powerplant Controls and Accessories

    51. Engine controls. If throttles or power levers for turbopropeller 
powered airplanes are such that any position of these controls will 
reduce the fuel flow to the engine(s) below that necessary for 
satisfactory and safe idle operation of the engine while the airplane is 
in flight, a means must be provided to prevent inadvertent movement of 
the control into this position. The means provided must incorporate a 
positive lock or stop at this idle position and must require a separate 
and distinct operation by the crew to displace the control from the 
normal engine operating range.
    52. Reverse thrust controls. For turbopropeller powered airplanes, 
the propeller reverse thrust controls must have a means to prevent their 
inadvertent operation. The means must have a positive lock or stop at 
the idle position and must require a separate and distinct operation by 
the crew to displace the control from the flight regime.
    53. Engine ignition systems. Each turbopropeller airplane ignition 
system must be considered an essential electrical load.
    54. Powerplant accessories. The powerplant accessories must meet FAR 
23.1163, and if the continued rotation of any accessory remotely driven 
by the engine is hazardous when malfunctioning occurs, there must be

[[Page 828]]

means to prevent rotation without interfering with the continued 
operation of the engine.

                       Powerplant Fire Protection

    55. Fire detector system. For turbopropeller powered airplanes, the 
following apply:
    (a) There must be a means that ensures prompt detection of fire in 
the engine compartment. An overtemperature switch in each engine cooling 
air exit is an acceptable method of meeting this requirement.
    (b) Each fire detector must be constructed and installed to 
withstand the vibration, inertia, and other loads to which it may be 
subjected in operation.
    (c) No fire detector may be affected by any oil, water, other 
fluids, or fumes that might be present.
    (d) There must be means to allow the flight crew to check, in 
flight, the functioning of each fire detector electric circuit.
    (e) Wiring and other components of each fire detector system in a 
fire zone must be at least fire resistant.
    56. Fire protection, cowling and nacelle skin. For reciprocating 
engine powered airplanes, the engine cowling must be designed and 
constructed so that no fire originating in the engine compartment can 
enter either through openings or by burn through, any other region where 
it would create additional hazards.
    57. Flammable fluid fire protection. If flammable fluids or vapors 
might be liberated by the leakage of fluid systems in areas other than 
engine compartments, there must be means to--
    (a) Prevent the ignition of those fluids or vapors by any other 
equipment; or
    (b) Control any fire resulting from that ignition.

                                Equipment

    58. Powerplant instruments. (a) The following are required for 
turbopropeller airplanes:
    (1) The instruments required by FAR 23.1305 (a) (1) through (4), (b) 
(2) and (4).
    (2) A gas temperature indicator for each engine.
    (3) Free air temperature indicator.
    (4) A fuel flowmeter indicator for each engine.
    (5) Oil pressure warning means for each engine.
    (6) A torque indicator or adequate means for indicating power output 
for each engine.
    (7) Fire warning indicator for each engine.
    (8) A means to indicate when the propeller blade angle is below the 
low-pitch position corresponding to idle operation in flight.
    (9) A means to indicate the functioning of the ice protection system 
for each engine.
    (b) For turbopropeller powered airplanes, the turbopropeller blade 
position indicator must begin indicating when the blade has moved below 
the flight low-pitch position.
    (c) The following instruments are required for reciprocating engine 
powered airplanes:
    (1) The instruments required by FAR 23.1305.
    (2) A cylinder head temperature indicator for each engine.
    (3) A manifold pressure indicator for each engine.

                                 General

    59. Function and installation. The systems and equipment of the 
airplane must meet FAR 23.1301, and the following:
    (a) Each item of additional installed equipment must--
    (1) Be of a kind and design appropriate to its intended function;
    (2) Be labeled as to its identification, function, or operating 
limitations, or any applicable combination of these factors, unless 
misuse or inadvertent actuation cannot create a hazard;
    (3) Be installed according to limitations specified for that 
equipment; and
    (4) Function properly when installed.
    (b) Systems and installations must be designed to safeguard against 
hazards to the aircraft in the event of their malfunction or failure.
    (c) Where an installation, the functioning of which is necessary in 
showing compliance with the applicable requirements, requires a power 
supply, that installation must be considered an essential load on the 
power supply, and the power sources and the distribution system must be 
capable of supplying the following power loads in probable operation 
combinations and for probable durations:
    (1) All essential loads after failure of any prime mover, power 
converter, or energy storage device.
    (2) All essential loads after failure of any one engine on two-
engine airplanes.
    (3) In determining the probable operating combinations and durations 
of essential loads for the power failure conditions described in 
paragraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph, it is permissible to assume 
that the power loads are reduced in accordance with a monitoring 
procedure which is consistent with safety in the types of operations 
authorized.
    60. Ventilation. The ventilation system of the airplane must meet 
FAR 23.831, and in addition, for pressurized aircraft, the ventilating 
air in flight crew and passenger compartments must be free of harmful or 
hazardous concentrations of gases and vapors in normal operation and in 
the event of reasonably probable failures or malfunctioning of the 
ventilating, heating, pressurization, or other systems, and equipment. 
If accumulation of hazardous quantities of smoke in the

[[Page 829]]

cockpit area is reasonably probable, smoke evacuation must be readily 
accomplished.

                    Electrical Systems and Equipment

    61. General. The electrical systems and equipment of the airplane 
must meet FAR 23.1351, and the following:
    (a) Electrical system capacity. The required generating capacity, 
and number and kinds of power sources must--
    (1) Be determined by an electrical load analysis; and
    (2) Meet FAR 23.1301.
    (b) Generating system. The generating system includes electrical 
power sources, main power busses, transmission cables, and associated 
control, regulation and protective devices. It must be designed so 
that--
    (1) The system voltage and frequency (as applicable) at the 
terminals of all essential load equipment can be maintained within the 
limits for which the equipment is designed, during any probable 
operating conditions;
    (2) System transients due to switching, fault clearing, or other 
causes do not make essential loads inoperative, and do not cause a smoke 
or fire hazard;
    (3) There are means, accessible in flight to appropriate 
crewmembers, for the individual and collective disconnection of the 
electrical power sources from the system; and
    (4) There are means to indicate to appropriate crewmembers the 
generating system quantities essential for the safe operation of the 
system, including the voltage and current supplied by each generator.
    62. Electrical equipment and installation. Electrical equipment, 
controls, and wiring must be installed so that operation of any one unit 
or system of units will not adversely affect the simultaneous operation 
of any other electrical unit or system essential to the safe operation.
    63. Distribution system. (a) For the purpose of complying with this 
section, the distribution system includes the distribution busses, their 
associated feeders, and each control and protective device.

  angle (TLA); for reverse thrust, reverse throttle lever angle (RLA) resolution is nonlinear over the active reverse thrust range, which is 51.54
  degrees to 96.14 degrees. The resolved element is 2.8 degrees uniformly over the entire active reverse thrust range, or 2.9% of the full range value
  of 96.14 degrees.

<R05>
Sec. 136.9  Air tour management plans (ATMP).

    (a) Establishment. The Administrator, in cooperation with the 
Director, shall establish an air tour management plan for any national 
park or tribal land for

[[Page 843]]

which such a plan is not in effect whenever a person applies for 
authority to conduct a commercial air tour operation over the park. The 
air tour management plan shall be developed by means of a public process 
in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. The objective of any 
air tour management plan is to develop acceptable and effective measures 
to mitigate or prevent the significant adverse impacts, if any, of 
commercial air tour operations upon the natural and cultural resources, 
visitor experiences, and tribal lands.
    (b) Environmental determination. In establishing an air tour 
management plan under this section, the Administrator and the Director 
shall each sign the environmental decision document required by section 
102 of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332) 
which may include a finding of no significant impact, an environmental 
assessment, or an environmental impact statement and the record of 
decision for the air tour management plan.
    (c) Contents. An air tour management plan for a park--
    (1) May prohibit commercial air tour operations in whole or in part;
    (2) May establish conditions for the conduct of commercial air tour 
operations, including, but not limited to, commercial air tour routes, 
maximum number of flights per unit of time, maximum and minimum 
altitudes, time of day restrictions, restrictions for particular events, 
intrusions on privacy on tribal lands, and mitigation of noise, visual, 
or other impacts;
    (3) Shall apply to all commercial air tour operations within \1/2\ 
mile outside the boundary of a national park;
    (4) Shall include incentives (such as preferred commercial air tour 
routes and altitudes, and relief from caps and curfews) for the adoption 
of quiet technology aircraft by commercial air tour operators conducting 
commercial air tour operations at the park;
    (5) Shall provide for the initial allocation of opportunities to 
conduct commercial air tour operations if the plan includes a limitation 
on the number of commercial air tour operations for any time period; and
    (6) Shall justify and document the need for measures taken pursuant 
to paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of this section and include such 
justification in the record of decision.
    (d) Procedure. In establishing an ATMP for a national park or tribal 
lands, the Administrator and Director shall--
    (1) Hold at least one public meeting with interested parties to 
develop the air tour management plan;
    (2) Publish the proposed plan in the Federal Register for notice and 
comment and make copies of the proposed plan available to the public;
    (3) Comply with the regulations set forth in 40 CFR 1501.3 and 
1501.5 through 1501.8 (for the purposes of complying with 40 CFR 1501.3 
and 1501.5 through 1501.8, the Federal Aviation Administration is the 
lead agency and the National Park Service is a cooperating agency); and
    (4) Solicit the participation of any Indian tribe whose tribal lands 
are, or may be, overflown by aircraft involved in a commercial air tour 
operation over the park or tribal lands to which the plan applies, as a 
cooperating agency under the regulations referred to in paragraph (d)(3) 
of this section.
    (e) Amendments. The Administrator, in cooperation with the Director, 
may make amendments to an air tour management plan. Any such amendments 
will be published in the Federal Register for notice and comment. A 
request for amendment of an ATMP will be made in accordance with Sec. 
11.25 of this chapter as a petition for rulemaking.


<R05>
Sec. 136.11  Interim operating authority.

    (a) General. Upon application for operating authority, the 
Administrator shall grant interim operating authority under this section 
to a commercial air tour operator for commercial air tour operations 
over a national park or tribal land for which the operator is an 
existing commercial air tour operator.
    (b) Requirements and limitations. Interim operating authority 
granted under this section--
    (1) Shall provide annual authorization only for the greater of--
    (i) The number of flights used by the operator to provide the 
commercial air

[[Page 844]]

tour operations within the 12-month period prior to April 5, 2000; or
    (ii) The average number of flights per 12-month period used by the 
operator to provide such operations within the 36-month period prior to 
April 5, 2000, and for seasonal operations, the number of flights so 
used during the season or seasons covered by that 12-month period;
    (2) May not provide for an increase in the number of commercial air 
tour operations conducted during any time period by the commercial air 
tour operator above the number the air tour operator was originally 
granted unless such an increase is agreed to by the Administrator and 
the Director;
    (3) Shall be published in the Federal Register to provide notice and 
opportunity for comment;
    (4) May be revoked by the Administrator for cause;
    (5) Shall terminate 180 days after the date on which an air tour 
management plan is established for the park and tribal lands;
    (6) Shall promote protection of national park resources, visitor 
experiences, and tribal lands;
    (7) Shall promote safe commercial air tour operations;
    (8) Shall promote the adoption of quiet technology, as appropriate, 
and
    (9) Shall allow for modifications of the interim operating authority 
based on experience if the modification improves protection of national 
park resources and values and of tribal lands.
    (c) New entrant operators. The Administrator, in cooperation with 
the Director, may grant interim operating authority under this paragraph 
(c) to an air tour operator for a national park or tribal lands for 
which that operator is a new entrant air tour operator if the 
Administrator determines the authority is necessary to ensure 
competition in the provision of commercial air tour operations over the 
park or tribal lands.
    (1) Limitation. The Administrator may not grant interim operating 
authority under this paragraph (c) if the Administrator determines that 
it would create a safety problem at the park or on the tribal lands, or 
if the Director determines that it would create a noise problem at the 
park or on the tribal lands.
    (2) ATMP limitation. The Administrator may grant interim operating 
authority under this paragraph (c) only if the ATMP for the park or 
tribal lands to which the application relates has not been developed 
within 24 months after April 5, 2000.

operations are conducted without creating a hazard to persons or 
property on the surface.

[Amdt. 137-3, 33 FR 9601, July 2, 1968]


<R05>
Sec. 137.51  Operation over congested areas: General.

    (a) Notwithstanding part 91 of this chapter, an aircraft may be 
operated over a congested area at altitudes required for the proper 
accomplishment of the agricultural aircraft operation if the operation 
is conducted--
    (1) With the maximum safety to persons and property on the surface, 
consistent with the operation; and
    (2) In accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (b) No person may operate an aircraft over a congested area except 
in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph.
    (1) Prior written approval must be obtained from the appropriate 
official or governing body of the political subdivision over which the 
operations are conducted.
    (2) Notice of the intended operation must be given to the public by 
some effective means, such as daily newspapers, radio, television, or 
door-to-door notice.
    (3) A plan for each complete operation must be submitted to, and 
approved by appropriate personnel of the FAA Flight Standards District 
Office having jurisdiction over the area where the operation is to be 
conducted. The plan must include consideration of obstructions to 
flight; the emergency landing capabilities of the aircraft to be used; 
and any necessary coordination with air traffic control.
    (4) Single engine aircraft must be operated as follows:
    (i) Except for helicopters, no person may take off a loaded 
aircraft, or make a turnaround over a congested area.
    (ii) No person may operate an aircraft over a congested area below 
the altitudes prescribed in part 91 of this chapter except during the 
actual dispensing operation, including the approaches and departures 
necessary for that operation.
    (iii) No person may operate an aircraft over a congested area during 
the actual dispensing operation, including the approaches and departures 
for that operation, unless it is operated in a

[[Page 850]]

pattern and at such an altitude that the aircraft can land, in an 
emergency, without endangering persons or property on the surface.
    (5) Multiengine aircraft must be operated as follows:
    (i) No person may take off a multiengine airplane over a congested 
area except under conditions that will allow the airplane to be brought 
to a safe stop within the effective length of the runway from any point 
on takeoff up to the time of attaining, with all engines operating at 
normal takeoff power, 105 percent of the minimum control speed with the 
critical engine inoperative in the takeoff configuration or 115 percent 
of the power-off stall speed in the takeoff configuration, whichever is 
greater, as shown by the accelerate stop distance data. In applying this 
requirement, takeoff data is based upon still-air conditions, and no 
correction is made for any uphill gradient of 1 percent or less when the 
percentage is measured as the difference between elevation at the end 
points of the runway divided by the total length. For uphill gradients 
greater than 1 percent, the effective takeoff length of the runway is 
reduced 20 percent for each 1-percent grade.
    (ii) No person may operate a multiengine airplane at a weight 
greater than the weight that, with the critical engine inoperative, 
would permit a rate of climb of at least 50 feet per minute at an 
altitude of at least 1,000 feet above the elevation of the highest 
ground or obstruction within the area to be worked or at an altitude of 
5,000 feet, whichever is higher. For the purposes of this subdivision, 
it is assumed that the propeller of the inoperative engine is in the 
minimum drag position; that the wing flaps and landing gear are in the 
most favorable positions; and that the remaining engine or engines are 
operating at the maximum continuous power available.
    (iii) No person may operate any multiengine aircraft over a 
congested area below the altitudes prescribed in part 91 of this chapter 
except during the actual dispensing operation, including the approaches, 
departures, and turn arounds necessary for that operation.

overshoot, or excursion from a runway or the unintentional departure 
from a taxiway.
    Scheduled operation means any common carriage passenger-carrying 
operation for compensation or hire conducted by an air carrier for which

Manager at least 30 days before the proposed effective date of the 
amendment, unless a shorter filing period is allowed by the Regional 
Airports Division Manager.
    (c) At any time within 30 days after receiving a notice of refusal 
to approve the application for amendment, the certificate holder may 
petition the Associate Administrator for Airports to reconsider the 
refusal to amend.
    (d) In the case of amendments initiated by the FAA, the Regional 
Airports Division Manager notifies the certificate holder of the 
proposed amendment, in writing, fixing a reasonable period (but not less 
than 7 days) within which the certificate holder may submit written 
information, views, and arguments on the amendment. After considering 
all relevant material presented, the Regional Airports Division Manager 
notifies the certificate holder within 30 days of any amendment adopted 
or rescinds the notice. The amendment becomes effective not less than 30 
days after the certificate holder receives notice of it, except that, 
prior to the effective date, the certificate holder may petition the 
Associate Administrator for Airports to reconsider the amendment, in 
which case its effective date is stayed pending a decision by the 
Associate Administrator for Airports.
    (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, 
if the Regional Airports Division Manager finds there is an emergency 
requiring immediate action with respect to safety in air transportation, 
the Regional Airports Division Manager may issue an amendment, effective 
without stay on the date the certificate holder receives notice of it. 
In such a case, the Regional Airports Division Manager incorporates the 
finding of the emergency and a brief statement of the reasons for the 
finding in the notice of the amendment. Within 30 days after the 
issuance of such an emergency amendment, the certificate holder may 
petition the Associate Administrator for Airports to reconsider either 
the finding of an emergency, the amendment itself, or both. This 
petition does not automatically stay the effectiveness of the emergency 
amendment.
